00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,570

As a team, we have brought these processes to bear on these

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,330
手动护肝
two investigations, and they have had a significant impact.

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,610
手动护肝
And do you think it's the same local man responsible

00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,810

for all four murders? - I do believe that, Jonathan.

手动护肝
By the railway tracks?

42
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,590
手动护肝
Apparently, he's adamant he wasn't trying to kill himself.

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,500
手动护肝
He checked out of the hospital this morning.

- Why you? - Well, it's the same as before, hm?

51
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,130
手动护肝
Cos it's easier to frame an innocent man

52
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,170
手动护肝
than it is for them to do their job.

is a forensic psychologist from Liverpool University.

Now, he interviewed Cooper for a book about violent offenders.

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,810

He's the only person to have gone on record

手动护肝
as saying that Cooper is a psychopath.

75
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,870
手动护肝
He also told us that,

76
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,450
手动护肝
like most psychopaths, Cooper is a narcissist

77
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,590
手动护肝
and we should treat him accordingly.

78

手动护肝
Like royalty.

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,030

手动护肝
Sterile, clean, quiet holding cells.

And make sure the custody sergeant is very charming.

手动护肝
Yes, boss.

84
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,610

Dr Stephens also recommended that one of the interview team

85
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,670
手动护肝
be a woman.

86
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,050
手动护肝
Yeah, apparently, Cooper has a very low opinion of female intelligence.

87
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,110
手动护肝
And a woman opposite him might make him drop his guard.

88
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,490
手动护肝
- Are you up for that, missus? - Let me at him.

That's settled, then. You and Rambo in the room.

90
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,170

- What about you, boss? - I don't think it's clever.

91
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,210
手动护肝
We know he's seen me on TV. I'm the face of the investigation.

92
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,350
手动护肝
That could rattle him.

93
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,970
手动护肝
No, I shall sit in the cheap seats with you lot on video link.

手动护肝
I'll ask you again, John.

97
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,970

Regarding the murders of Peter and Gwenda Dixon,

98
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,130

were you the person responsible?

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,650
手动护肝
He starts off cooperative.

100
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,690

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,250
手动护肝
down comes the portcullis.

102
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,670
手动护肝
So, we keep it non-confrontational.

103
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,910
手动护肝
Er, maybe even avoid any direct questions about the murders.

104
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,410
手动护肝
If we can't talk about the murders,

105
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,610
手动护肝
how are we supposed to get anything useful out of him?

106
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,750
手动护肝
You talk about the exhibits.

107

That's what this is all about,

which ones he thinks might bear a trace of his or his victims' DNA.

Someone's keen.

OK, John...

147
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,750
手动护肝
1978.

148
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,230
手动护肝
The year you won Spot The Ball.

149
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,030
手动护肝
£94,000

150
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,950
手动护肝
That's about £800,000 in today's money.

151
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,570
手动护肝
Your life was good at the time.

152
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,950
手动护肝
You bought Big House Farm at Rosemarket.

153
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,710
手动护肝
Your wife told Huntsman

154
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,250
手动护肝
you also took your brothers and their families to Spain.

155
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,450
手动护肝
- I certainly did. - You didn't take Adrian.

156
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,110
手动护肝
Why was that, John?

157
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,590
手动护肝
I don't know.

158
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,770
手动护肝
Maybe he was ill with his asthma.

159
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,730
手动护肝
You've been talking to him, have you?

160
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,270
手动护肝
No, John.

161
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,710
手动护肝
We have his statements from Huntsman.

162
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,470
手动护肝
So, John...

163
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,730
手动护肝
things were going well.

164
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,310
手动护肝
You were buying and selling properties.

165
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,690
手动护肝
But then the money worries started.

166
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,090
手动护肝
Well, an estate agent tricked me out of a lot of money.

167
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,870
手动护肝
My solicitor lied to me.

168
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,610
手动护肝
When you come into a bit of money,

169
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,650
手动护肝
well, the cockroaches come out of the woodwork.

170
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,250
手动护肝
It can't have been easy,

171
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,770
手动护肝
moving from Big House Farm, making the adjustment

172
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,510
手动护肝
from owning your own place to renting at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

173
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,370
手动护肝
A man doesn't sit around moping.

174
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,410
手动护肝
He's got to get out there, got to get grafting.

175
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,350
手动护肝
Between 1978 and 1983, you spent over £125,000.

176
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,910
手动护肝
That's £35,000 more than your winnings on Spot The Ball.

177
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,890
手动护肝
Well, you've got to speculate to accumulate.

178
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,490
手动护肝
Is that when you started gambling?

179
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,170
手动护肝
What, £3 or £4 a week?

180
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,790
手动护肝
A 50p round robin?

181
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,810
手动护肝
I'd hardly call that gambling.

182
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,110
手动护肝
Adrian told Huntsman you bet £1,000 on one race.

183
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,790
手动护肝
He misremembered.

184
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,110
手动护肝
April 20th, 1983.

185
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,450
手动护肝
Clareston Hall, Freystrop.

186
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,020
手动护肝
Your first conviction for burglary. Is that your idea of grafting, John?

187
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,390
手动护肝
I don't like your tone.

188
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,150
手动护肝
Oh, don't shut down, John boy.

189
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,830
手动护肝
John...

190
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,530
手动护肝
if you don't want to talk to us, we'll respect that.

191
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,510
手动护肝
You can go back to Dyffryn Prison today.

192
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,270
手动护肝
I'm not a thief.

193
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,990
手动护肝
Well done, Rambo.

194
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,710
手动护肝
OK. You told Huntsman

195
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,950
手动护肝
that you visited Scoveston Park for the first time in August 1984,

196
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,490
手动护肝
when you went to meet Richard and Helen Thomas

197
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,690
手动护肝
about working on their land. Is that correct, John?

198
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,490
手动护肝
I know what Adrian told Huntsman about Scoveston Park.

199
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,810
手动护肝
About me telling him and his mother to lie to the police

200
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,730
手动护肝
about us all being in that night, the night of the fire.

201
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,550
手动护肝
That the truth was, according to him,

202
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,630
手动护肝
that I came home late smelling of a bonfire.

203
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,940
手动护肝
Now, you say you haven't spoken to him. Fair enough.

204
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,350
手动护肝
But there's something I want to get off my chest.

205
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,290
手动护肝
Everything that comes out

206
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,590
手动护肝
of that boy's mouth is lies.

207
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,790
手动护肝
Has been ever since we didn't take him to Spain.

208
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,150
手动护肝
When me and Pat got back...

209
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,910
手动护肝
he was a different boy.

210
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,470
手动护肝
He was surly.

211
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,130
手动护肝
He was disobedient.

212
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,570
手动护肝
Bunking off school.

213
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,190
手动护肝
Smoking wacky baccy.

214
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,670
手动护肝
Forging cheques. Stealing money... off us.

215
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,650
手动护肝
And all because we didn't take him on holiday.

216
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,630
手动护肝
As a father...

217
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,930
手动护肝
I take no pleasure in saying this.

218
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,600
手动护肝
But the truth is, the real truth, the night of the fire...

219
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,790
手动护肝
the murders...

220
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,510
手动护肝
Adrian was the one who came home late.

221
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,490
手动护肝
He's pointing the finger at his own son?

222
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,950
手动护肝
Piece of filth.

223
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,840
手动护肝
You know, I've been across the table from wife-beaters,

224
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,660
手动护肝
rapists, paedophiles.

225
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,760
手动护肝
- And I let him get to me. - And you made something happen.

226
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,080
手动护肝
When he feels under threat, he blames Adrian.

227
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,680
手动护肝
That's something to keep an eye on.

228
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,180
手动护肝
So...

229
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,740
手动护肝
- tomorrow... - Huntsman.

230
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,160
手动护肝
With particular emphasis on our prime exhibits.

231
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,980
手动护肝
There you go, look at that.

232
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,700
手动护肝
Now, John, I want to ask you about some exhibits

233
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,620
手动护肝
found by Operation Huntsman.

234
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,820
手动护肝
Some of them pertain to one particular robbery,

235
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,280
手动护肝
the so-called Sardis robbery, for which you were convicted.

236
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,740
手动护肝
Wrongly convicted.

237
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,080
手动护肝
For the tape, I am showing Mr Cooper a photograph

238
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,140
手动护肝
of Huntsman exhibit BB/109, a black glove.

239
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,500
手动护肝
Do you recognise this glove, John?

240
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,340
手动护肝
I haven't got the foggiest.

241
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,500
手动护肝
I had a bit of an accident last night.

242
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,200
手动护肝
I can't see a thing without them. Sorry.

243
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,490
手动护肝
I know you're on a tight schedule.

244
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,680
手动护肝
We know you had a problem with your glasses during Huntsman.

245
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,880
手动护肝
We got your prescription from Dyffryn Prison.

246
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,580
手动护肝
Just in case.

247
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,920
手动护肝
I don't actually wear gloves.

248
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,540
手动护肝
Adrian's the glove-wearer in the family.

249
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,100
手动护肝
For the tape, evidence photo of Huntsman exhibit MTJ/14.

250
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,280
手动护肝
Black balaclava.

251
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,770
手动护肝
Do you recognise this balaclava, John?

252
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,540
手动护肝
Do you remember that Huntsman found head hairs inside it

253
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,200
手动护肝
that were forensically tested

254
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,660
手动护肝
and confirmed to be yours?

255
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,020
手动护肝
Yes.

256
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,260
手动护肝
And yet you said it wasn't yours.

257
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,120
手动护肝
That... was a mistake.

258
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,410
手动护肝
I was wrong. I think that was mine.

259
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,360
手动护肝
Ten years in prison, a man gets into a lot of thinking.

260
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,680
手动护肝
He remembers things that he hasn't thought about for ages.

261
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,880
手动护肝
And one of the things I do remember,

262
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,260
手动护肝
and it was about 20 years ago,

263
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,960
手动护肝
was I did used to have a black balaclava

264
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,160
手动护肝
just like that one that I used to wear

265
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,000
手动护肝
when I went fishing with a boat that I had.

266
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,060
手动护肝
Well, remembering that, everything slotted into place.

267
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,240
手动护肝
There's only one explanation that makes any sense.

268
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,300
手动护肝
I didn't lose the balaclava.

269
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,660
手动护肝
It was stolen.

270
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,040
手动护肝
By the same individual who did the robbery

271
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,300
手动护肝
that I was wrongly convicted of.

272
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,100
手动护肝
OK, John.

273
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,340
手动护肝
On we go.

274
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,960
手动护肝
Huntsman exhibits...

275
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,460
手动护肝
PAS/1, a sawn-off shotgun,

276
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,380
手动护肝
and PH/2,

277
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,360
手动护肝
a sawn-off shotgun with customised shoulder strap.

278
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,860
手动护肝
Do you recognise these shotguns, John?

279
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,640
手动护肝
You're trying to trick me.

280
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,380
手动护肝
This gun is mine.

281
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,380
手动护肝
This one is not.

282
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,700
手动护肝
Huntsman found this gun, wrapped in oilcloth,

283
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,080
手动护肝
buried underneath the duck run at your home.

284
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,600
手动护肝
Why did you bury it, John?

285
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,200
手动护肝
I didn't want Adrian to find it. Didn't want him hurting himself.

286
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,900
手动护肝
And this gun, PH/2,

287
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,540
手动护肝
was found with the glove and balaclava under the hedge

288
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,080
手动护肝
close to the scene of the Sardis robbery.

289
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,800
手动护肝
I'm aware. Huntsman must have told me about a hundred times.

290
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,320
手动护肝
If you look closely, John,

291
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,180
手动护肝
you will see that both guns have the same modifications.

292
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,340
手动护肝
Sawn-off barrels and sawn-down stocks.

293
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,660
手动护肝
Screws in both barrels and stocks

294
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,380
手动护肝
for a shoulder strap.

295
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,140
手动护肝
John, how do you account for the fact that

296
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,460
手动护肝
the very same distinctive DIY modifications

297
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,680
手动护肝
- were made to both shotguns? - Coincidence.

298
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,000
手动护肝
Stranger things have happened, right?

299
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,220
手动护肝
And while we're on the subject...

300
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,680
手动护肝
I want to talk about the gun that Huntsman found under the hedge.

301
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,940
手动护肝
For the tape.

302
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,380
手动护肝
Here we go again.

303
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,400
手动护肝
During the Huntsman trial, and I remember this very clearly

304
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,960
手动护肝
because I thought it was very strange at the time,

305
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,400
手动护肝
the prosecution barrister handed me the gun on more than one occasion.

306
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,620
手动护肝
Well, what I'm saying is, if my DNA is on that,

307
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,340
手动护肝
that's the reason why.

308
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,720
手动护肝
His time in the library was well-spent.

309
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,140
手动护肝
He's digging his own grave.

310
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,420
手动护肝
Today was a result for us.

311
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,480
手动护肝
The lengths he went to

312
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,180
手动护肝
to distance himself from the Sardis exhibits means we are bang-on.

313
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,540
手动护肝
His story about the gun being handled in the trial.

314
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,140
手动护肝
The balaclava being stolen 20 years before, in 1988,

315
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,120
手动护肝
the year before Coastal Path.

316
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,360
手动护肝
He wasn't just telling us the man who stole the balaclava

317
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,600
手动护肝
did the Sardis robbery,

318
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,520
手动护肝
he was saying the man murdered the Dixons.

319
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,200
手动护肝
Today, he confirmed what we'd always suspected.

320
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,920
手动护肝
And he gave us something new into the bargain.

321
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,660
手动护肝
When he killed Peter and Gwenda Dixon...

322
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,380
手动护肝
he wore that balaclava.

323
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,200
手动护肝
And PH/2 is, without a doubt, the murder weapon.

324
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,000
手动护肝
What exhibits shall we send back for re-testing, then, boss?

325
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,720
手动护肝
The Sardis robbery gun and the balaclava.

326
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,160
手动护肝
Don't bother with the duck run gun.

327
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,640
手动护肝
- Save that money for something else. - What about the glove?

328
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,820
手动护肝
He said Adrian was the glove-wearer. That's got to mean something.

329
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,380
手动护肝
Put it in.

330
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,840
手动护肝
Don't all call me a twat at once...

331
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,740
手动护肝
Twat!

332
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,360
手动护肝
But what's the point in re-testing

333
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,560
手动护肝
when we already know they'll come back negative?

334
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,520
手动护肝
Testing for trace DNA is like battleships. It's a guessing game.

335
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,520
手动护肝
The boffins can't see what they're looking for.

336
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,520
手动护肝
They test small areas they think are most likely

337
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,220
手动护肝
and hope for the best.

338
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,560
手动护肝
But there's always bits that haven't been tested.

339
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,560
手动护肝
So...

340
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,050
手动护肝
tomorrow is our last day with him.

341
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,540
手动护肝
I'm happy to risk a bit of confrontation.

342
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
手动护肝
Rambo, I want Ella to lead.

343
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,980
手动护肝
Right.

344
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,610
手动护肝
Hey, don't leave me hanging!

345
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,920
手动护肝
John, do you think the man in the drawing

346
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,140
手动护肝
bears any resemblance to yourself as you were in July 1989?

347
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,540
手动护肝
No, not at all.

348
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,280
手动护肝
Even the detective who came round the house said as much at the time.

349
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,500
手动护肝
Detective Rees. The one who used to drink with you?

350
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,540
手动护肝
Yeah.

351
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,160
手动护肝
So, John, how did you look in July 1989?

352
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,360
手动护肝
- Haven't you got any photographs? - No, John.

353
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,560
手动护肝
Which is why we'd appreciate your help.

354
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,100
手动护肝
- I don't remember. It was 20 years ago. - 19, actually.

355
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,040
手动护肝
Let me get this straight.

356
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,960
手动护肝
You can't remember how you looked back then,

357
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,120
手动护肝
but you're confident that this sketch, made at that time,

358
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,140
手动护肝
doesn't resemble you at all.

359
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
手动护肝
I'm sure.

360
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,840
手动护肝
Because I know I didn't have hair that long.

361
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,520
手动护肝
- You never had collar-length hair? - I don't like it on my neck.

362
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,040
手动护肝
What about the clothes the man in the drawing's wearing, John?

363
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,480
手动护肝
I don't go in for shorts.

364
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,820
手动护肝
Shorts were more Adrian's thing.

365
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,860
手动护肝
Stick with the shorts, Ella.

366
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,640
手动护肝
The witness who saw this man using Peter Dixon's stolen cash card

367
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,180
手动护肝
said that the shorts he was wearing were khaki coloured.

368
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,320
手动护肝
Did you ever own a pair of khaki shorts, John?

369
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
手动护肝
Yes.

370
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,440
手动护肝
But they were more bathers

371
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,300
手动护肝
than shorts.

372
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,520
手动护肝
They were shorter. Those are long shorts.

373
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,360
手动护肝
Mine were short shorts, more like bathers.

374
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,260
手动护肝
Adrian used to wear them more than I did.

375
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,180
手动护肝
He was always borrowing my clothes.

376
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,840
手动护肝
These are the only shorts that Huntsman found

377
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,500
手动护肝
at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

378
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,120
手动护肝
No khaki, and they're all a lot shorter

379
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,560
手动护肝
than the ones in the wanted photo.

380
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,880
手动护肝
What about bathers?

381
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,280
手动护肝
- He said that more than once. - Bathers.

382
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,760
手动护肝
Shorts. Swimming trucks. Trousers. We did the lot.

383
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,120
手动护肝
He said Andrew wore them.

384
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,260
手动护肝
That's his tell.

385
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,580
手动护肝
Something about those shorts worries him.

386
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,980
手动护肝
Why?

387
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,090
手动护肝
And where the hell are they?

388
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,860
手动护肝
Mrs Patricia Cooper?

389
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,880
手动护肝
Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins.

390
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,320
手动护肝
This is DI Ella Richards.

391
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,960
手动护肝
Can we come in for a minute, please?

392
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,740
手动护肝
Come in.

393
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,380
手动护肝
You won't find anything.

394
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,840
手动护肝
Well, you lot took everything of John's nine years ago.

395
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,380
手动护肝
Not us, Mrs Cooper.

396
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,480
手动护肝
You used to work at Ocky White's, didn't you, Mrs Cooper?

397
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,840
手动护肝
I was the best seamstress they had.

398
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,680
手动护肝
These were taken the year your husband won on Spot The Ball?

399
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,100
手动护肝
1978?

400
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,860
手动护肝
- Yes? - Yes.

401
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,980
手动护肝
A professional photographer came to the house.

402
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,760
手动护肝
Do you have any later photographs of the two of you, Mrs Cooper?

403
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,940
手动护肝
No.

404
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,200
手动护肝
We weren't big on family photos.

405
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,260
手动护肝
1978, that was the year you went on holiday to Spain, right?

406
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,740
手动护肝
Yes.

407
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,360
手动护肝
Do you mind me asking, why didn't you take Adrian with you?

408
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,780
手动护肝
I don't remember.

409
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,700
手动护肝
Are you finished?

410
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,740
手动护肝
Thank you.

411
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,360
手动护肝
What's wrong with you?

412
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,800
手动护肝
I had the police round.

413
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,800
手动护肝
Asking about an old khaki pair of bathers of yours.

414
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,170
手动护肝
What's that about?

415
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,080
手动护肝
- Did they find them? - No.

416
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,930
手动护肝
They took all your clothes when you were arrested. You know that.

417
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,730
手动护肝
I want you to get hold of Adrian. Find out if he's got them.

418
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,130
手动护肝
I don't have a number for him.

419
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,850
手动护肝
Well, Shirley's daughter, she's a receptionist in the hospital.

420
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,690
手动护肝
She'll give it to you. You're his mother.

421
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,920
手动护肝
You're telling me...

422
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,290
手动护肝
to get in touch with Adrian?

423
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,800
手动护肝
Yes!

424
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,650
手动护肝
Forensics said they took it apart, tested every nook and cranny,

425
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,410
手动护肝
every millimetre of the shoulder strap.

426
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,970
手动护肝
Yeah, they also said re-testing it for DNA

427
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,610
手动护肝
would be a complete waste of Ottawa's money and their time.

428
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,240
手动护肝
That's not their call to make.

429
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,840

Where are we with the forensics budget?

430
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,280
手动护肝
17,000 left.

431
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
手动护肝
Out of 350,000.

432
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,200
手动护肝
Jesus...

433
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,090
手动护肝
Boss, I'm not convinced we're getting

434
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,490
手动护肝
the best possible bang for our buck here.

435
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,010
手动护肝
I think we should have a sit-down with Dr Gallop.

436
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,880
手动护肝
Make sure we're not getting sidelined by some big London job.

437
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,050
手动护肝
Is that metal I can see through the paint?

438
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,050
手动护肝
It's where the finish has worn off. That thing was made in the 1940s.

439
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,130
手动护肝
- And that's the manufacturer's finish? - Yeah, we assumed.

440
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,810
手动护肝
Obviously, we've not seen the thing in the flesh. Assumed?

441
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,120
手动护肝
Really, Lynne? Glyn?

442
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,690
手动护肝
Did Huntsman recover any paint from Cooper's home?

443
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,130
手动护肝
Yeah, six pots in the shed.

444
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,130
手动护肝
Nige, get the Huntsman shed file.

445
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,600
手动护肝
Any of them black?

446
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,200
手动护肝
Yeah.

447
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,720
手动护肝
JAW/100.

448
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,160
手动护肝
JAW/100...

449
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,800
手动护肝
I want that taken out of storage.

450
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,050
手动护肝
Your team have been on this case for 18 months now

451
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,890
手动护肝
and all we've got to show for it is

452
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,120
手动护肝
a partial for Peter Dixon's DNA on a piece of rope.

453
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,920
手动护肝
With respect, we're seeing this a lot.

454
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,960
手动护肝
This obsession with DNA at the expense of...

455
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,930
手动护肝
well, other, less fashionable avenues of analysis.

456
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,440
手动护肝
Ottawa's insistence that we focus solely on DNA

457
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,610
手动护肝
has put my team in a straitjacket.

458
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,570
手动护肝
No. No, no, no. We asked you to prioritise DNA,

459
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,370
手动护肝
but not to the exclusion of everything else.

460
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,810
手动护肝
But that's the impression you gave my colleague.

461
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,400
手动护肝
Dr Gallop...

462
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,690
手动护肝
let's say we remove the straitjacket.

463
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,680
手动护肝
How would that change things?

464
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,930
手动护肝
Well, it would allow us to widen our search,

465
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,640
手动护肝
look for other types of evidence.

466
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,040
手动护肝
Now, we're agreed that the killer wore gloves, yes?

467
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,850
手动护肝
We look for textile fibres.

468
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,330
手动护肝
Fibres are circumstantial.

469
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,920
手动护肝
- We need hard proof. - Yes, but...

470
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,800
手动护肝
if we can find enough fibres linking culprit to victim,

471
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,640
手动护肝
it could tell an equally compelling story

472
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,330
手动护肝
about the circumstances of the crimes.

473
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,010
手动护肝
Maybe even get you over the charge threshold with the CPS.

474
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,120
手动护肝
OK.

475
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,250
手动护肝
Let's go for it.

476
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,080
手动护肝
All right.

477
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,640
手动护肝
We have one other request.

478
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,320
手动护肝
We believe...

479
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,970
手动护肝
that this is the Coastal Path murder weapon.

480
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,360
手动护肝
Yeah, PH/2.

481
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,570
手动护肝
I heard you'd asked the team to have another look.

482
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,770
手动护肝
Yes, but this is a different request.

483
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,250
手动护肝
Among the items recovered by Huntsman

484
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,490
手动护肝
from the shed at Cooper's home

485
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,560
手动护肝
was this 750ml tin of Anvileen satin black metal paint.

486
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,720
手动护肝
I think Cooper painted the barrels of the gun

487
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,490
手动护肝
to make it less visible at night.

488
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,970
手动护肝
The murders were in 1989.

489
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,360
手动护肝
Anvileen didn't manufacture this particular paint until 1995.

490
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,920
手动护肝
So, if PH/2 is the murder weapon,

491
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,720
手动护肝
there could still be trace DNA under the paint.

492
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,360
手动护肝
Well, that's more than six years.

493
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,570
手动护肝
During which the gun would've been cleaned,

494
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,930
手动护肝
rained on, exposed to the elements.

495
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,030
手动护肝
Are you sure this is the best use of what's left of your budget?

496
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,880
手动护肝
I'm sure.

497
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,440
手动护肝
All right.

498
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,000
手动护肝
Hello?

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,480
手动护肝
Hello, Adrian.

500
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,130
手动护肝
- Hello?- How did you get my number?

501
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,000
手动护肝
Nice to hear from you, too!

502
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,640
手动护肝
What do you want?

503
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,610
手动护肝
Just to find out how you are.

504
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,890
手动护肝
I heard you were in hospital.

505
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,940
手动护肝
Why did you go and do a silly thing like that?

506
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,480
手动护肝
It was nothing.

507
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,960
手动护肝
A mistake.

508
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,890
手动护肝
I thought I could come and see you.

509
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,120
手动护肝
It's not a good time.

510
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,690
手动护肝
I'm doing the place up.

511
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,120
手动护肝
It's a bombsite.

512
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,520
手动护肝
So, come to mine, then.

513
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,850
手动护肝
Ah, boss. Ollie Wakefield from the CPS called you.

514
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,120
手动护肝
Great.

515
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,530
手动护肝
Ollie, Steve Wilkins.

516
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,800
手动护肝
Listen...

517
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,560
手动护肝
Ottawa needs a favour.

518
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,050
手动护肝
The governor at Dyffryn Prison

519
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,250
手动护肝
refuses to delay Cooper's second parole hearing.

520
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,250
手动护肝
And I think a word from the CPS might persuade the man

521
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,490
手动护肝
to see some sense.

522
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,880
手动护肝
The case, it isn't there, Steve.

523
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,570
手动护肝
You know what the prison services will say. No hard evidence.

524
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,010
手动护肝
- I'm sorry. - Ollie, if he is released

525
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,490
手动护肝
back into the community and he hurts someone,

526
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,210
手动护肝
"institutionally incompetent" will be a happy memory

527
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,680
手动护肝
when we are up to our necks in public inquiries.

528
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,250
手动护肝
You're that convinced he'll kill again?

529
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,680
手动护肝
He's a serial killer.

530
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,480
手动护肝
Serial killers don't...

531
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,160
手动护肝
They can't stop.

532
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,690
手动护肝
Steve, inevitable mutterings have started.

533
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
手动护肝
There's talk of shutting Ottawa down.

534
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,600
手动护肝
Hi, Ma.

535
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,960
手动护肝
What happened to you?

536
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
手动护肝
An accident at work.

537
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,140
手动护肝
I thought you might be peckish.

538
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,160
手动护肝
Are you still visiting him?

539
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,760
手动护肝
Every week.

540
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,800
手动护肝
Is he gonna live here with you when he gets out?

541
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,560
手动护肝
I'm his wife.

542
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,460
手动护肝
Where else is he gonna live?

543
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,250
手动护肝
He's a bit worked up at the moment.

544
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,610
手动护肝
The police are bothering him again.

545
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,120
手动护肝
Oh, yeah?

546
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,720
手动护肝
Actually...

547
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,760
手动护肝
it's a silly thing.

548
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,990
手动护肝
You don't have an old pair of khaki bathers of his, do you?

549
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,250
手动护肝
Still running things, even from in prison.

550
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
手动护肝
It wasn't true what I said earlier about an accident at work.

551
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,480
手动护肝
He did this to me.

552
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,810
手动护肝
The same year you had those stupid photos done,

553
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,400
手动护肝
he broke my back.

554
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,890
手动护肝
He didn't break your back.

555
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,890
手动护肝
A year ago, I was fit and strong, working in Ireland, hod-carrying.

556
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,120
手动护肝
One morning, it was like I was struck by lightning.

557
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,640
手动护肝
Nine hours of surgery.

558
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,240
手动护肝
Rods and screws in my pelvis and spine.

559
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,620
手动护肝
I thought it was the work that caused it, but the consultant

560
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,280
手动护肝
told me it was an injury from childhood.

561
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,770
手动护肝
Straight away, I knew it was that punch in the back.

562
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,050
手动护肝
You knew something was seriously wrong when it happened,

563
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,970
手动护肝
but you didn't take me to the hospital

564
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,570
手动护肝
because he was worried someone might be suspicious.

565
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,090
手动护肝
I never knew it was serious.

566
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,480
手动护肝
I couldn't move!

567
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,350
手动护肝
You left me to lie in my own urine for five days.

568
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,660
手动护肝
You didn't even change my sopping sheets.

569
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,770
手动护肝
You brought me plenty of toast and strawberry jam, though!

570
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,410
手动护肝
A couple of weeks later, you left me with nan

571
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,640
手动护肝
and all took off for sunny Spain.

572
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,200
手动护肝

But she was just following orders.

手动护肝

You've got an unusual hobby, John.

718
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,470
手动护肝
Oh, yes, the scuba diving. The scuba diving.

719
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:06,750
手动护肝
It's the place to do it down there, isn't it?

720
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,430
手动护肝
Well, we've got the coastline, yes.

721
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:11,230
手动护肝
And there's the shoulder-length hair he never had.

722
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,710
手动护肝
Well, we've got the deep water...

723
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,910
手动护肝
And you can swim over mountains and all sorts.

724
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,030
手动护肝
We hope you all have a good night. Give them a round of applause.

725
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,250
手动护肝
Best of luck, John.

726
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,370
手动护肝
That's five.

727
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,570
手动护肝
'20.

728
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,930
手动护肝
And one.

729
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,250
手动护肝
26.

730
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,110
手动护肝
'36, and takes the first round.

731
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:03,040
手动护肝
Right, John, it's only £36, but you really could do with this.

732
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,410
手动护肝
What are you having a bath for?

733
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,010
手动护肝
I won't be long!

734
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,600
手动护肝
- I could get in with you. - No, John.

735
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,050
手动护肝
- I'm shy. - Shy?

736
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,360
手动护肝
I've seen it all before, you know?

737
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,130
手动护肝
Come on, missus, let me in.

738
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,270
手动护肝
Can you pause it there, please?

739
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,410
手动护肝
Rewind a bit.

740
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,610
手动护肝
There.

00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,170
手动护肝
It may not prove he killed the Dixons.

742
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,480
手动护肝
But it proves what he looked like four weeks before.

743
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,050
手动护肝
999, which service?

744
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,050
手动护肝
Hello?
