兰博  我们该查查

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,930
是否有跟他对话过的
if there are any psychologists out there

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,890
心理学家  我想听听他们的看法
who have interviewed him. We want their insights.

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,640
好的
Right you are.

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,040
头儿  刚刚是彭布罗克郡港口警局
Boss, that was Pembroke Dock Police Station.

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,970
安德鲁・库珀昨晚被发现
Andrew Cooper was found collapsed

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,490
倒在了菲什加德外的铁轨上

他被送往了维瑟布什医院

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,010
他自称服多了自己的止痛药
He claimed he overdid it on his pain medication.

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,210
在铁轨旁吗
By the railway tracks?

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,000
据说  他坚称自己并没有想自杀
Apparently, he's adamant he wasn't trying to kill himself.

44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,480
他今早已经出院了
He checked out of the hospital this morning.

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,040
企图自杀吗
Tried to kill himself?

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,280
他可没有很努力  他还活着呢
Didn't try very hard, did he? He's still breathing.

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,080
-约翰  -对了  你猜怎么

警察想找我谈话
The police want to interview me.

49
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,320
新闻上的报道  我就是他们的嫌疑人
That stuff on the news. I'm their bloody suspect.

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,840
-为什么是你  -跟之前一样  是吧
- Why you? - Well, it's the same as before, hm?

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,850
因为陷害无辜的人
Cos it's easier to frame an innocent man

52
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,800
比认真工作要容易
than it is for them to do their job.

53
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,960
你最好小心点  他们可能会想找你谈
Now, you'd better be on your toes. They might wanna talk to you.

54
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,960
找我谈
Talk to me?

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,170
谈什么  我什么都不知道
What about? I don't know anything.

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,640
等他们找来  你就这么说
When they come knocking, that's exactly what you tell them.

57
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,450
你可别因为同情
And don't go running off to Adrian

58
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,680
就跑去找阿德里安  他是告密鬼
cos you feel sorry him. He's a rat.

59
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,480
你对他说的话  会被他直接捅给警察
And anything you say to him will go directly back to the police.

60
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,720
我来了
I'm coming!

61
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,440
你好  安德鲁
Hello, Andrew.

62

你好
Hello.

63
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,960
抱歉打扰  听说你刚从医院出来
Sorry to bother you. I heard you'd been in hospital.

64
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,000
你还好吗
How are you doing?

65
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,760
我很好
I'm fine.

66
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,170
我就想告诉你
Well, I just wanted you to know

67
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,200
如果你觉得你需要支持
that if you feel like you need some support,

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,960
我们可以帮你
we can sort something for you.

69
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,200
我不需要那个
I don't need anything like that.

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,320
你不用担心我
You don't have to worry about me.

71
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,250
哈利・斯蒂芬斯博士
Dr Harry Stephens...

72
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,490
是利物浦大学的鉴证心理学家
..is a forensic psychologist from Liverpool University.

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,880
他为一本关于暴力罪犯的书采访过库珀
Now, he interviewed Cooper for a book about violent offenders.

74
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,690
他是唯一公开表示
He's the only person to have gone on record

75
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,130
库珀是冷血精神病的人
as saying that Cooper is a psychopath.

76
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,810
他还跟我们说
He also told us that,

77
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,050
就像大部分冷血精神病那样  库珀是个自恋狂
like most psychopaths, Cooper is a narcissist

78
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,160
我们也该据此调整对他的态度
and we should treat him accordingly.

79
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,770
把他捧上天
Like royalty.

80
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,800
哄他  让他产生虚假的安全感
Er, pamper him into a false sense of security.

81
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,440
奈杰  找个合适的警局做面谈
Nige, we need you to find a suitable station for the interviews.

82
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,770
朴素  干净  安静的拘留室
Sterile, clean, quiet holding cells.

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,600
并确保守卫警官非常可亲
And make sure the custody sergeant is very charming.

84
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,560
是  头儿
Yes, boss.

85
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,450
斯蒂芬斯博士还建议
Dr Stephens also recommended

86
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,250
面谈团队中得有个女人
that one of the interview team be a woman.

87
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,530
对  据说  库珀很瞧不起
Yeah, apparently, Cooper has a very

88
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,650
女性的智力
low opinion of female intelligence.

89
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,880
如果他对面有女人  可能会让他放松警惕
And a woman opposite him might make him drop his guard.

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,520
-你能行吗  姑娘  -让我去吧
- Are you up for that, missus? - Let me at him.

91
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,000
那就这样  你和兰博去
That's settled, then. You and Rambo in the room.

92
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,640
-你呢  头儿  -那恐怕不明智
- What about you, boss? - I don't think it's clever.

93
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,690
我们知道他在电视上看到过我
We know he's seen me on TV.

94
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,400
我是调查的门面人物
I'm the face of the investigation.

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,960
可能会让他不安
That could rattle him.

96
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,850
我还是和你们一起坐在后排看监控吧
No, I shall sit in the cheap seats with you lot on video link.

97
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,800
那就敬我们的面谈团队
Hey, here's to our interview team, then.

98
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,200
猛男兰博[《第一滴血》]和花瓶宾博
Rambo and Bimbo.

99
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,530
约翰  我再问你一次
'I'll ask you again, John.

100
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,370
彼得和格温达・迪克森被谋杀
'Regarding the murders of Peter and Gwenda Dixon,

101
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,520
是不是你做的
'were you the person responsible?

102
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,610
他一开始很配合
He starts off cooperative.

103
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,520
但当你的人开始采取高压手段
Then, when your man gets heavy-handed,

104
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,050
他就闭口不谈了
down comes the portcullis.

105
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,450
那我们就不要咄咄逼人
So, we keep it non-confrontational.

106
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,960
甚至避免直接询问有关谋杀的任何问题
Er, maybe even avoid any direct questions about the murders.

107
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,890
如果不提谋杀
If we can't talk about the murders,

108
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,880
我们怎么从他那得到有用信息
how are we supposed to get anything useful out of him?

109
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,520
提证物
You talk about the exhibits.

110
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,530
这才是重点
That's what this is all about,

111
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,690
试着套出他最担心的是什么
trying to draw out which ones he's worried about,

112
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,130
看他认为哪件证物
which ones he thinks might

113
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,760
可能会留下他或受害者的DNA
bear a trace of his or his victims' DNA.

114
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,000
杰克
Jack?

115
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,120
某人挺积极嘛
Someone's keen.

116
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,160
我要参加郡队的选拔赛
I've got a trial for the county.

117
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,080
不是吧
No way!

118
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,130
太棒了
Ah, that's great.

119
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,120
好样的  小威尔金斯
Well done, Wilkins Junior!

120
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,320
你能来吗
Do you think you can come along?

121
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,840
-算了吧  没事  -不不不
- No, it's OK. - No, no, no.

122
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,040
胡说什么呢  我一定去
Bollocks. I'll be there.

123
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,040
真不错  儿子
Well done, son!

124
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,160
-吃东西去  -好
- Food? - Aye.

125
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,720
走吧
All right?

126
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,720
嗯
Yeah.

127
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,160
我们在阳光明媚的阿曼福德见
I'll see you in sunny Ammanford.

128
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,450
史蒂夫・威尔金斯
Steve Wilkins.

129
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,240
头儿  这里是指挥部
'Hello, boss, this is Control.

130

预计9点抵达阿曼福德

他们都准备就绪  就等你了
They're all set up for you.

133
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,600
我去厨房带了杯喝的  头儿

早上好  约翰
Good morning, John.

138
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,320
旅途还愉快吧
'I hope you had a comfortable journey.'

139
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,400
当然了
'Oh, yes.'

140
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,840
商务舱
Business class.

141
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,280
你看  礼貌点又不要钱  是不
See, it doesn't cost anything to be polite.

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,680
他上钩了
He takes the bait.

143
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,920
他变老了
He's old.

144
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,880
但看着还是很强壮
He still looks strong, though.

145
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,840
开始了  头儿
All right, boss.

146
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,520
早
'Morning.'

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,400
早上好  约翰
Good morning, John.

148
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,850
电视上的那个大人物哪去了
Where's the big cheese, then, the one off the telly?

149
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,800
威尔金斯警司不会参与我们的面谈  约翰
Detective Superintendent Wilkins won't be joining us, John.

150
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,760
他喜欢在一旁看戏  是吗
Oh, he likes to watch, does he?

151
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,160
好了  约翰
OK, John...

152
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,160
1978年
1978.

153
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,770
你赢下了《找到那个球》
'The year you won Spot The Ball.

154
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,370
9万4千镑奖金
￡94,000.

155
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,120
放在今天大约是80万镑
'That's about ￡800,000 in today's money.

156
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,650
你当时过着优渥的生活
'Your life was good at the time.'

157
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,720
你在玫瑰市场镇买下了大农场
You bought Big House Farm at Rosemarket.

158
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,250
你妻子告诉猎人行动的调查组
Your wife told Huntsman

159
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,480
你还带你兄弟和其家属去了西班牙
you also took your brothers and their families to Spain.

160
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,360
-是这样没错  -你没带上阿德里安
- I certainly did. - You didn't take Adrian.

161
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,800
为什么  约翰
Why was that, John?

162
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,400
我不知道
I don't know.

163
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,280
可能是他当时犯了哮喘
Maybe he was ill with his asthma.

164
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,760
你们不是一直在和他联系吗
You've been talking to him, have you?

165
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,880
没有  约翰
No, John.

166
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,120
我们有他给调查组留下的口供
We have his statements from Huntsman.

167
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,170
话说  约翰
So, John...

168
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,370
当时一切都很顺利
things were going well.

169
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,050
你那段时间一直在炒房
You were buying and selling properties.

170
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,160
但之后你开始为钱发愁
But then the money worries started.

171
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,850
一个房产经纪人骗了我一大笔钱
Well, an estate agent tricked me out of a lot of money.

172
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,640
我的事务律师对我撒了谎
My solicitor lied to me.

173
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,610
当你赚了一点钱时
When you come into a bit of money,

174
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,530
就会引来一群觊觎的蟑螂
well, the cockroaches come out of the woodwork.

175
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,880
从拥有自己的大农场
It can't have been easy,

176
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,810
到在玫瑰草地巷28号租房
moving from Big House Farm, making the adjustment

177
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,440
这个转变你肯定不容易接受吧
from owning your own place to renting at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

178
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,410
男人不会自怨自艾
A man doesn't sit around moping.

179
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,050
而是会想办法改变现状
He's got to get out there, got to get grafting.

180
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,900
从1978年到1983年
Between 1978 and 1983,

181
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,170
你花了超过12万5千英镑
you spent over ￡125,000.

182
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,280
比你在《找到那个球》赢的奖金还多3万5千英镑
That's ￡35,000 more than your winnings on Spot The Ball.

183
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,920
要想赚大钱  就得承受一些风险
Well, you've got to speculate to accumulate.

184
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,560
你就是从那时起开始赌博的吗
Is that when you started gambling?

185
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,360
每周就那么三四英镑
What, ￡3 or ￡4 a week?

186
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,410
玩玩50镑一次的三选一
A ￡50 round robin?

187
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,850
这不能叫赌博吧
I'd hardly call that gambling.

188
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,840
阿德里安告诉调查组你一场比赛就下了一千镑赌注
Adrian told Huntsman you bet ￡1,000 on one race.

189
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,640
他记错了
He misremembered.

190
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,970
1983年  4月20号
April 20th, 1983.

191
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,610
弗雷斯特洛普的克莱斯顿公寓
Clareston Hall, Freystrop.

192
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,290
你第一次被判入室盗窃罪
Your first conviction for burglary.

193
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,880
这就是你"改变现状"的方式吗  约翰
Is that your idea of grafting, John?

194
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,920
我不喜欢你的语气
I don't like your tone.

195
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,440
别不说话啊  约翰
Oh, don't shut down, John boy.

196
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,080
约翰
John...

197
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,120
如果你不想和我们说话  我们会尊重你
...if you don't want to talk to us, we'll respect that.

198
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,880
你今天就可以回到达夫林监狱
You can go back to Dyffryn Prison today.

199
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,760
我不是贼
I'm not a thief.

200
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,920
做得好  兰博
Well done, Rambo.

201
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,930
你告诉猎人行动的调查组
'OK. You told Huntsman'

202
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,170
你在1984年8月
that you visited Scoveston Park

203
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,080
第一次去了斯科维斯顿公园
for the first time in August 1984,

204
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,090
跟理查德和海伦・托马斯见面
when you went to meet Richard and Helen Thomas

205
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,330
谈论在他们那里工作的事  对吗  约翰
about working on their land. Is that correct, John?

206
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,720
我知道阿德里安是怎么跟调查组说
I know what Adrian told Huntsman

207
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
斯科维斯顿公园的事的
about Scoveston Park.

208
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,690
说我叫他和他妈妈对警察撒谎
About me telling him and his mother to lie to the police

209
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,520
说火灾那晚我们一直在一起
about us all being in that night, the night of the fire.

210
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,530
据他说  事实就是
That the truth was, according to him,

211
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,880
我那天很晚才回家  身上一股焚烧的味道
that I came home late smelling of a bonfire.

212
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,160
你说你们没找他谈过  行吧
Now, you say you haven't spoken to him. Fair enough.

213
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,080
但有件事我想说出来
But there's something I want to get off my chest.

214
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,050
那男孩说的每句话
'Everything that comes out'

215
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,490
都是谎话
of that boy's mouth is lies.

216
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,840
自从我们没带他去西班牙后就一直撒谎成性
Has been ever since we didn't take him to Spain.

217
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,800
我和帕特回来之后
When me and Pat got back...

218
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,760
他就变了一个人
he was a different boy.

219
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,480
他变得暴躁
He was surly.

220
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,090
非常不听话
He was disobedient.

221
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,250
一直逃课
Bunking off school.

222
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,240
抽大麻
Smoking wacky baccy.

223
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,760
伪造支票  偷我们的钱
Forging cheques. Stealing money... off us.

224
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,720
这都是因为我们没带他去度假
And all because we didn't take him on holiday.

225
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,840
作为一个父亲
As a father...

226
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,320
这么说我一点都不高兴
I take no pleasure in saying this.

227
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,080
但事实的真相是  火灾和谋杀案发生的
But the truth is, the real truth, the night of the fire...

228
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,520
那天晚上
..the murders...

229
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,000
阿德里安才是晚回家的那个人
Adrian was the one who came home late.

230
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,760
他是在指控自己的儿子吗
He's pointing the finger at his own son?

231
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,840
人渣
Piece of filth.

232
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,970
我曾讯问过虐待妻子的人
You know, I've been across the table from wife-beaters,

233
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,560
强奸犯  恋童癖
rapists, paedophiles.

234
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,280
-结果我还是被他左右了情绪  -你起到效果了
- And I let him get to me. - And you made something happen.

235
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,200
当他感觉到威胁时  他就把锅甩给阿德里安
When he feels under threat, he blames Adrian.

236
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,760
这是值得注意的事
That's something to keep an eye on.

237
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,920
所以
So...

238
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,040
明天  猎人行动
tomorrow... Huntsman.

239
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,240
特别强调我们的主要证据
With particular emphasis on our prime exhibits.

240
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,960
给你们  好好看看
There you go, look at that.

241
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,850
约翰  我想问你关于一些证据的事
Now, John, I want to ask you about some exhibits

242
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,240
是猎人行动找到的
found by Operation Huntsman.

243
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,370
其中一些和一起抢劫案有关
Some of them pertain to one particular robbery,

244
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,290
就是你被定罪的萨迪斯抢劫案
the so-called Sardis robbery, for which you were convicted.

245
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,600
那是误判
Wrongly convicted.

246
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,490
录音存证  下面给库珀先生展示的照片是
'For the tape, I am showing Mr Cooper a photograph'

247
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,090
猎人行动库存证物BB-109  一只黑色手套
of Huntsman exhibit BB/109, a black glove.

248
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,120
约翰  你认得这只手套吗
Do you recognise this glove, John?

249
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,160
我不知道
I haven't got the foggiest.

250
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,800
昨晚我出了点小事故
I had a bit of an accident last night.

251
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,250
没有眼镜我什么都看不清  抱歉
I can't see a thing without them. Sorry.

252
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,880
我知道你们时间很紧
"I know you're on a tight schedule."

253
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,880
我们知道你在猎人行动时期眼镜就出了问题
We know you had a problem with your glasses during Huntsman.

254
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,880
我们从达夫林监狱拿到了你的度数
We got your prescription from Dyffryn Prison.

255
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,120
以防万一
Just in case.

256
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,960
我其实不戴手套
I don't actually wear gloves.

257
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,160
阿德里安才是家里爱戴手套的人
Adrian's the glove-wearer in the family.

258
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,500
录音存证  猎人行动库存证物MTJ-14的照片
For the tape, evidence photo of Huntsman exhibit MTJ/14.

259
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,840
黑头套
Black balaclava.

260
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,400
约翰  你认得这个黑头套吗
Do you recognise this balaclava, John?

261
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,840
你记不记得调查组在里面找到几根头发
Do you remember that Huntsman found head hairs inside it

262
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,610
经过法医鉴定后
that were forensically tested

263
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,440
证实了是你的头发
"and confirmed to be yours?"

264
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,280
是我的
Yes.

265
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,560
但你之前还说这不是你的
And yet you said it wasn't yours.

266
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,210
我记错了
That... was a mistake.

267
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,320
我说错了  这确实是我的
I was wrong. I think that was mine.

268
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,560
在监狱度过了十年  有的是时间仔细思考
Ten years in prison, a man gets into a lot of thinking.

269
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,370
他会想起很多已经抛到脑后的事情
He remembers things that he hasn't thought about for ages.

270
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,720
有一件事情我确实记得很清楚
And one of the things I do remember,

271
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,560
大概在20年前
and it was about 20 years ago,

272
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,850
我确实曾有过一顶黑色头套
was I did used to have a black balaclava

273
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,170
这个和我之前那顶一模一样
just like that one that I used to wear

274
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,120
我开自己的船去钓鱼时经常戴着它
"when I went fishing with a boat that I had."

275
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,080
想起了这个  其他事都顺其自然想起来了
"Well, remembering that, everything slotted into place."

276
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,490
对于这种情况  只有一种合理解释
There's only one explanation that makes any sense.

277
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,010
我的头套没有丢
I didn't lose the balaclava.

278
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,850
有人把它偷走了
It was stolen.

279
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,870
就是那个抢劫犯偷的
By the same individual who did the robbery

280
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,880
结果却怪在了我头上
"that I was wrongly convicted of."

281
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,830
好吧  约翰
OK, John.

282
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,930
我们继续
On we go.

283
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,430
猎人行动库存证物
Huntsman exhibits...

284
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,010
PAS-1  一把锯短的双管猎枪
"PAS/1, a sawn-off shotgun,"

285
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,050
还有证物PH-2
and PH/2,

286
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,660
一把锯短的双管猎枪  配定制的特殊肩带
a sawn-off shotgun with customised shoulder strap.

287
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,030
约翰  你认得这两把猎枪吗
Do you recognise these shotguns, John?

288
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,480
你想骗我
You're trying to trick me.

289
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,410
这把枪是我的
This gun is mine.

290
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,770
这把不是
This one is not.

291
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,450
调查组找到了这把枪  被油布包着
Huntsman found this gun, wrapped in oilcloth,

292
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,010
埋在你家的鸭笼下面
buried underneath the duck run at your home.

293
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,310
约翰  你为什么把它埋了
Why did you bury it, John?

294
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,900
我不想让阿德里安找到  怕他伤到自己
I didn't want Adrian to find it. Didn't want him hurting himself.

295
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,820
还有这把枪  PH-2
And this gun, PH/2,

296
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,740
和手套与黑头套一起埋在树篱下面
was found with the glove and balaclava under the hedge

297
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,510
就在萨迪斯村劫案发生地附近
close to the scene of the Sardis robbery.

298
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,640
我知道  调查组跟我说过几百遍了
I'm aware. Huntsman must have told me about a hundred times.

299
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,030
约翰  如果你仔细看
If you look closely, John,

300
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,070
你会发现两把枪都进行了同样的改造
you will see that both guns have the same modifications.

301
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,150
锯短的枪管  锯掉的枪柄
Sawn-off barrels and sawn-down stocks.

302
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,710
在枪管和枪柄上都有螺丝
Screws in both barrels and stocks

303
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,070
装上了肩带
"for a shoulder strap."

304
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,140
约翰  这两把猎枪上
"John, how do you account for the fact that"

305
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,830
如此独特的改造都一模一样
the very same distinctive DIY modifications

306
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,350
-对此你如何解释  -巧合罢了
- were made to both shotguns? - Coincidence.

307
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,260
世界之大  无奇不有  对吧
Stranger things have happened, right?

308
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,270
既然我们说到这个了
And while we're on the subject...

309
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,900
我想谈一谈
..I want to talk about

310
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,550
调查组在树篱下找到的那把枪
the gun that Huntsman found under the hedge.

311
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,960
录音存证
For the tape.

312
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,850
又来这一套
Here we go again.

313
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,250
在猎人行动审讯期间  我记得很清楚
"During the Huntsman trial, and I remember this very clearly"

314
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,410
因为当时我觉得特别奇怪
"because I thought it was very strange at the time,"

315
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,340
那位控方出庭律师
the prosecution barrister

316
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,370
不止一次把那把枪递给我
handed me the gun on more than one occasion.

317
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,950
我的意思是  如果那上面有我的DNA
Well, what I'm saying is, if my DNA is on that,

318
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,230
这就是原因
that's the reason why.

319
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,440
他在图书馆的时间可没白过
His time in the library was well-spent.

320
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,380
他在自掘坟墓
He's digging his own grave.

321
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,950
今天我们有很大收获
Today was a result for us.

322
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,690
他不遗余力地把自己与萨迪斯村
The lengths he went to to distance himself from

323
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,350
找到的证物撇清关系  说明我们正中要害
the Sardis exhibits means we are bang-on.

324
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,980
他说庭审时摸过那把枪
His story about the gun being handled in the trial.

325
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,920
黑头套在二十年前的1988年被偷
The balaclava being stolen 20 years before, in 1988,

326
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,270
也就是海岸小径案发生前一年
the year before Coastal Path.

327
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,460
他的说法不只告诉我们  偷头套的人
He wasn't just telling us the man who stole the balaclava

328
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,100
犯下了萨迪斯抢劫案
did the Sardis robbery,

329
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,800
他还证明了就是这个人杀了迪克森夫妇
he was saying the man murdered the Dixons.

330
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,550
今天他证实了我们一直所怀疑的
Today, he confirmed what we'd always suspected.

331
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,610
而且他给了我们新的线索
And he gave us something new into the bargain.

332
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,320
他杀害彼得和格温达・迪克森时
When he killed Peter and Gwenda Dixon...

333
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,970
戴着那个黑头套
he wore that balaclava.

334
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,230
而PH-2号证物毫无疑问就是杀人凶器
And PH/2 is, without a doubt, the murder weapon.

335
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,980
那我们要把哪些证物送回去重新检测  头儿
What exhibits shall we send back for re-testing, then, boss?

336
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,780
萨迪斯抢劫案的枪和黑头套
The Sardis robbery gun and the balaclava.

337
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,080
鸭笼那把枪就算了
Don't bother with the duck run gun.

338
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,240
把钱省下来干点别的吧
Save that money for something else.

339
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,770
那手套呢
What about the glove?

340
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,470
他说阿德里安才戴手套
He said Adrian was the glove-wearer.

341
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,820
这一定别有含义
That's got to mean something.

342
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,840
把手套也加上
Put it in.

343
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,980
我说完后别都立刻叫我蠢货
Don't all call me a twat at once...

344
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,130
蠢货
Twat!

345
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,250
但我们明知道检测结果会是不匹配的
..But what's the point in re-testing

346
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,030
重新检测还有什么意义
when we already know they'll come back negative?

347
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,710
检测残留DNA就像玩战舰棋  是个碰运气的游戏
Testing for trace DNA is like battleships. It's a guessing game.

348
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,710
检测员并不知道他们要找的是什么
The boffins can't see what they're looking for.

349
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,760
他们检测自己认为最有可能的微小区域
They test small areas they think are most likely

350
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
并期望有好的结果
and hope for the best.

351
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,920
但是总会有地方没被检测到
But there's always bits that haven't been tested.

352
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,400
那么
So...

353
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,490
明天就是我们审讯他的最后一天了
..Tomorrow is our last day with him.

354
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,970
我愿意冒点风险  和他当面对峙
I'm happy to risk a bit of confrontation.

355
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,900
兰博  我想让艾拉主谈
Rambo, I want Ella to lead.

356
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,170
好的
Right.

357
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,550
别把我晾在这啊
Hey, don't leave me hanging!

358
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,610
约翰  你觉得画像上的人
John, do you think the man in the drawing

359
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,670
和1989年7月时的你有任何相似之处吗
bears any resemblance to yourself as you were in July 1989?

360
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,440
没有  完全不像
No, not at all.

361
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,310
就连当时
Even the detective who

362
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,260
来家里的警探也这么说
came round the house said as much at the time.

363
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,280
里斯警员  以前常和你一起喝酒的那位
Detective Rees. The one who used to drink with you?

364
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,960
对
Yeah.

365
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,390
那约翰  1989年7月时你长什么样
So, John, how did you look in July 1989?

366
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,360
-你们没照片吗  -没有  约翰
- Haven't you got any photographs? - No, John.

367
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,820
所以如果你能帮我们  我们会很感激
Which is why we'd appreciate your help.

368
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,290
-我不记得了  都20年前了  -实际上是19年
- I don't remember. It was 20 years ago. - 19, actually.

369
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,690
对不起约翰  我就直说了
Sorry, John.  Let me get this straight.

370
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,010
你不记得你那时长什么样
You can't remember how you looked back then,

371
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,800
但你很确信那时候画的这幅画像
but you're confident that this sketch, made at that time,

372
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,350
"完全不像你"
'doesn't resemble you at all.'

373
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,400
我很确定
I'm sure.

374
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,690
因为我没留过那么长的头发
Because I know I didn't have hair that long.

375
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,940
你从没留过齐肩的长发吗
You never had collar-length hair?

376
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,820
我不喜欢头发扎到脖子
I don't like the way it feels on my neck.

377
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,710
画像里的人所穿的衣服呢  约翰
What about the clothes the man in the drawing's wearing, John?

378
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,340
我不穿短裤
I don't go in for shorts.

379
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,610
阿德里安比较喜欢短裤
Shorts were more Adrian's thing.

380
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,930
接着问短裤的事  艾拉
Stick with the shorts, Ella.

381
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,850
看见这人使用彼得・迪克森被盗银行卡的目击者
The witness who saw this man using Peter Dixon's stolen cash card

382
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,870
说他穿的短裤是卡其色的
said that the shorts he was wearing were khaki coloured.

383
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,790
你有过卡其色短裤吗  约翰
Did you ever own a pair of khaki shorts, John?

384
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,450
有过
Yes.

385
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,400
但那更像是泳裤长度的  而非短裤
But they were more bathers than shorts.

386
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,250
比画像上的要短  画里的短裤偏长
They were shorter than those. Those are long shorts.

387
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,640
我的短裤很短  接近泳裤长度
Mine were short shorts, more like bathers.

388
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,930
阿德里安那时比我更常穿这条裤子
Adrian used to wear them more than I did.

389
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,300
他总是借我衣服穿
He was always borrowing my clothes.

390
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,800
猎人行动在玫瑰草地巷28号
These are the only shorts that Huntsman found

391
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,070
只找到了这些短裤
at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

392
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,030
没有卡其色的  并且都比
No khaki, and they're all a lot shorter

393
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,420
通缉令画像里的短很多
than the ones in the wanted photo.

394
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,870
那游泳裤呢
What about bathers?

395
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,570
他提了不止一次
He said that more than once.

396
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,880
泳裤  短裤  沙滩裤  长裤
Bathers. Shorts. Swimming trucks. Trousers.

397
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,830
我们全都查了
We did the lot.

398
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,280
他说那条短裤都是安德鲁在穿的
He said Andrew wore them.

399
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,550
他露馅了
That's his tell.

400
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,720
那条短裤让他感到担心
Something about those shorts worries him.

401
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,110
为什么
Why?

402
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,810
这条裤子到底在哪里
And where the hell are they?

403
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,830
帕特丽夏・库珀太太吗
Mrs Patricia Cooper?

404
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,770
我是史蒂夫・威尔金斯警司
Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins.

405
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,390
这位是艾拉・理查兹督察
This is DI Ella Richards.

406
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,230
请问我们能进去一下吗
Can we come in for a minute, please?

407
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
请进
Come in.

408
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,140
你们什么都不会找到的
You won't find anything.

409
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,670
你们九年前就把约翰的所有东西都拿走了
Well, you lot took everything of John's nine years ago.

410
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,440
不是我们  库珀太太
Not us, Mrs Cooper.

411
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,990
你过去在奥基・怀特公司工作  对吗  库珀太太
You used to work at Ocky White's, didn't you, Mrs Cooper?

412
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,650
我曾是公司里最好的裁缝
I was the best seamstress they had.

413
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,430
这是你丈夫赢得《找到那个球》奖金那年拍的吗
These were taken the year your husband won on Spot The Ball?

414
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,040
1978年
1978?

415
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,770
-对吗  -是的
- Yes? - Yes.

416
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,450
一名专业摄影师来家里拍的
A professional photographer came to the house.

417
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,720
你有你们后来的照片吗  库珀太太
Do you have any later photographs of the two of you, Mrs Cooper?

418
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,780
没有
No.

419
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,900
我们不喜欢拍家庭照
We weren't big on family photos.

420
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,190
1978年  就是你去西班牙度假的那一年  对吗
1978, that was the year you went on holiday to Spain, right?

421
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,360
对
Yes.

422
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,070
冒昧问下  你为什么没带阿德里安一起去
Do you mind me asking, why didn't you take Adrian with you?

423
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,430
我不记得了
I don't remember.

424
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,280
你们问完了吗
Are you finished?

425
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,770
谢谢你
Thank you.

426
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,070
你怎么了
What's wrong with you?

427
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,970
警察来找过我
I had the police round.

428
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,870
问起你一条旧卡其色泳裤
Asking about an old khaki pair of bathers of yours.

429
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,940
这是怎么回事
What's that about?

430
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,690
-他们找到了吗  -没有
- Did they find them? - No.

431
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
你当年被捕时他们拿走了你所有衣服  你知道的
They took all your clothes when you were arrested. You know that.

432
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,820
你去联系一下阿德里安  看看是否在他那里
I want you to get hold of Adrian. Find out if he's got them.

433
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,480
我没他电话
I don't have a number for him.

434
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,010
雪莉的女儿是医院的接待员
Well, Shirley's daughter, she's a receptionist in the hospital.

435
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,260
她会告诉你电话号码的  你毕竟是他妈
She'll give it to you. You're his mother.

436
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,490
你是让我
You're telling me...

437
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,290
去跟阿德里安联系吗
to get in touch with Adrian?

438
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,560
是的
Yes!

439
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,970
鉴证部门说他们把肩带拆了  各个部分
Forensics said they took it apart, tested every nook and cranny,

440
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,470
每一寸都检测了
every millimetre of the shoulder strap.

441
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,930
他们还说重新检测上面的DNA
Yeah, they also said re-testing it for DNA

442
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,030
完全是浪费敬渥太华行动的钱和他们的时间
would be a complete waste of Ottawa's money and their time.

443
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,970
这不由他们决定
That's not their call to make.

444
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,540
我们的法医鉴定预算还有多少钱
Where are we with the forensics budget?

445
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,300
还剩1.7万镑
17,000 left.

446
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,410
总经费是3.5万镑
Out of 350,000.

447
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,450
天啊
Jesus...

448
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,920
老实说  头儿  我觉得
Honestly, boss, I'm not convinced

449
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,220
我们的钱没真正花在点子上
we're getting the best possible bang for our buck here.

450
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,270
我觉得我们该和盖洛普博士谈谈
I think we should have a sit-down with Dr Gallop.

451
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,780
确保我们不会被某个伦敦大案挤到一边
Make sure we're not getting sidelined by some big London job.

452
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,160
油漆下露出来的是金属吗
Is that metal I can see through the paint?

453
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,800
这里表面的漆磨损了
It's where the finish has worn off.

454
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,400
这把枪是上世纪40年代造的
That thing was made in the 1940s.

455
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,370
-漆是制造商刷的吗  -我们猜测是
- And that's the manufacturer's finish? - Yeah, we assumed.

456
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,210
-我们显然没亲眼见过这东西  -猜测
- Obviously, we've not seen the thing in the flesh. - Assumed?

457
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,550
真的吗  林恩  格林
Really, Lynne? Glyn?

458
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,810
猎人行动在库珀家有找到油漆吗
Did Huntsman recover any paint from Cooper's home?

459
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,810
在工具棚里找到六罐
Yeah, six pots in the shed.

460
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,790
奈杰  把猎人行动工具棚的文件拿来
Nige, get the Huntsman shed file.

461
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,930
其中有黑色油漆吗
Any of them black?

462
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,600
有
Yeah.

463
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,230
JAW-100
Jaw/100.

464
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,430
JAW-100
Jaw/100...

465
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,460
把这个从仓库调出来
I want that taken out of storage.

466
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,460
总部

467
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,970
你的小组调查该案已有18个月了
Your team have been on this case for 18 months now

468
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,350
我们能找到的证据
and all we've got to show for it is

469
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,510
只有彼得・迪克森在一截绳子上的部分DNA
a partial for Peter Dixon's DNA on a piece of rope.

470
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,440
恕我直言  这种事我们经常见到
With respect, we're seeing this a lot.

471
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,820
过分执着于DNA  结果忽视了...
This obsession with DNA at the expense of...

472
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,530
其他没那么流行的分析方法
..Well, other, less fashionable avenues of analysis.

473
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,950
渥太华行动坚持要我们只关注DNA检测
Ottawa's insistence that we focus solely on DNA

474
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,890
使得我的团队无法施展
has put my team in a straitjacket.

475
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,230
不不不  我们是要求你们优先检测DNA
No. No, no, no. We asked you to prioritise DNA,

476
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,030
并没有排除其他方法
but not to the exclusion of everything else.

477
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,860
但我的同事们以为你就是这个意思
But that's the impression you gave my colleague.

478
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,090
盖洛普博士...
Dr Gallop...

479
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,340
如果让你们放手去做
..Let's say we remove the straitjacket.

480
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,810
情况会有什么不同吗
How would that change things?

481
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,580
那我们就能扩大搜索范围
Well, it would allow us to widen our search,

482
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,580
寻找其他类型的证据
look for other types of evidence.

483
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,250
我们一致认为凶手当时戴了手套  是吧
Now, we're agreed that the killer wore gloves, yes?

484
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,030
我们可以找织物纤维
We look for textile fibres.

485
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,720
纤维属于间接证据
Fibres are circumstantial.

486
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,490
-我们需要确凿证据  -是的  但是...
- We need hard proof. - Yes, but...

487
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,080
如果我们能找到足够的纤维
if we can find enough fibres

488
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,950
将犯人和受害者联系起来
linking culprit to victim,

489
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,010
同样可以有力描绘
it could tell an equally compelling story

490
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,950
犯罪情景
about the circumstances of the crimes.

491
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,170
甚至能帮你们跨过皇家检察署的起诉门槛
Maybe even get you over the charge threshold with the CPS.

492
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,550
好吧
Ok.

493
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,060
就这么做吧
Let's go for it.

494
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,300
好的
All right.

495
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,840
我们还有一个请求
We have one other request.

496
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,620
我们认为...
We believe...

497
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,570
这是海岸小径案的凶器
that this is the Coastal Path murder weapon.

498
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,810
是的  PH-2
Yeah, PH/2.

499
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,430
我听说了你让团队再检测一下
I heard you'd asked the team to have another look.

500
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,440
是的  但这次的请求不一样
Yes, but this is a different request.

501
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,400
猎人行动找到的物品之中
Among the items recovered by Huntsman

502
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,570
有一桶在库珀家工具棚发现的油漆
from the shed at Cooper's home

503
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,830
是安维林牌的750毫升装缎黑金属漆
was this 750ml tin of Anvileen satin black metal paint.

504
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,610
我认为库珀给枪管上了漆
I think Cooper painted the barrels of the gun

505
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,450
为了让枪在晚上不那么显眼
to make it less visible at night.

506
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,770
凶杀案发生在1989年
The murders were in 1989.

507
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,830
安维林直到1995年才开始生产这款油漆
Anvileen didn't manufacture this particular paint until 1995.

508
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,200
所以  如果PH-2是凶器
So, if PH/2 is the murder weapon,

509
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,440
油漆涂层下可能还找得到残留DNA
there could still be trace DNA under the paint.

510
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,730
已经过去6年多了
Well, that's more than six years.

511
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,810
在这期间枪可能被清洁过
During which the gun would've been cleaned,

512
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,440
被雨淋过  暴露在不同的天气环境中
rained on, exposed to the elements.

513
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,410
你确定把剩下的经费花在这上面是最明智的选择吗
Are you sure this is the best use of what's left of your budget?

514
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,260
我确定
I'm sure.

515
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,580
好吧
All right.

516
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,500
阿德里安・库珀

517
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,040
出售
2万英镑
可议价

518
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,760
喂
Hello?

519
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,880
你好  阿德里安
Hello, Adrian.

520
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,640
-喂  -你怎么知道我的电话号码
- 'Hello?' - How did you get my number?

521
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,560
听到你的声音我也很开心
Nice to hear from you, too!

522
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,690
你想怎么样
What do you want?

523
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,010
就是看看你过得如何
'Just to find out how you are.'

524
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,060
我听说你之前住院了
I heard you were in hospital.

525
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,430
你为什么要做那种傻事
Why did you go and do a silly thing like that?

526
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,490
根本没什么
It was nothing.

527
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,530
我只是不小心
'A mistake.'

528
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,710
我可以去看望你
I thought I could come and see you.

529
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,890
现在不太方便
It's not a good time.

530
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,300
我在装修
I'm doing the place up.

531
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,490
这里一团乱
'It's a bombsite.'

532
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,500
那就来我这吧
So, come to mine, then.

533
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,530
头儿  皇家检察署的奥利・韦克菲尔德来电找你
Ah, boss. Ollie Wakefield from the CPS called you.

534
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,680
好的
Great.

535
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,320
奥利  我是史蒂夫・威尔金斯
Ollie, Steve Wilkins.

536
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,460
听着
Listen...

537
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,970
渥太华行动需要你的帮助
Ottawa needs a favour.

538
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,660
达夫林监狱的监狱长
The governor at Dyffryn Prison

539
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,950
拒绝将库珀的第二次假释听证会延后
refuses to delay Cooper's second parole hearing.

540
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,520
皇家检察署说的话
'And I think a word from the CPS

541
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,940
应该能让他通融一下
might persuade the man 'to see some sense.

542
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,130
这个案子立不了  史蒂夫
The case, it isn't there, Steve.

543
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,810
你知道狱政处的人会说什么  没有确凿证据
You know what the prison services will say. No hard evidence.

544
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,150
-我也无能为力  -奥利  如果他被释放
- I'm sorry. - 'Ollie, if he is released'

545
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,400
回到社会上伤了人
back into the community and he hurts someone,

546
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,610
公众会把我们责骂得体无完肤
"Institutionally incompetent" will be a happy memory

547
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,900
到时我们就会怀念以前只被骂"体制性无能"了
'when we are up to our necks in public inquiries.'

548
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,910
你这么确信他还会杀人
You're that convinced he'll kill again?

549
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,690
他是连环杀手
He's a serial killer.

550
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,590
连环杀手不会...
Serial killers don't...

551
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,240
他们停不下来
They can't stop.

552
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,250
史蒂夫  不可避免的抱怨已经开始了
'Steve, inevitable mutterings have started.'

553
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,600
有人提出叫停渥太华行动
There's talk of shutting Ottawa down.

554
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,120
嗨  妈
Hi, Ma.

555
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,230
你的腿怎么了
What happened to you?

556
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,460
工作上出了事故
An accident at work.

557
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,620
自己安排好葬礼  就不用劳烦家人了

558
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,140
我想着你可能饿了
I thought you might be peckish.

559
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,840
你还去探望他吗
Are you still visiting him?

560
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,550
每周都去
Every week.

561
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,070
他出来后会跟你一起在这生活吗
Is he gonna live here with you when he gets out?

562
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,350
我是他妻子
I'm his wife.

563
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,610
他还能去哪生活
Where else is he gonna live?

564
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,440
他现在有点生气
He's a bit worked up at the moment.

565
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,040
警察又开始纠缠他了
The police are bothering him again.

566
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,470
是吗
Oh, yeah?

567
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,740
实际上
Actually...

568
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,010
这问题可能有点傻
it's a silly thing.

569
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,910
他的旧卡其色泳裤在你那吗
You don't have an old pair of khaki bathers of his, do you?

570
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,570
即使在监狱里  还在发号施令
Still running things, even from in prison.

571
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,380
我之前说工作中出了事故  那并不是真的
It wasn't true what I said earlier about an accident at work.

572
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,800
这是他造成的
He did this to me.

573
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,130
就是你们拍了那些破照片的那年
The same year you had those stupid photos done,

574
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,590
他弄伤了我的背
he broke my back.

575
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,180
他没有弄伤你的背
He didn't break your back.

576
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,260
一年前  我还很健康强壮
A year ago, I was fit and strong,

577
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
在爱尔兰工作  做建筑小工
working in Ireland, hod-carrying.

578
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,480
一天早上  我好像被闪电击中了一样
One morning, it was like I was struck by lightning.

579
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,130
做了整整九个小时的手术
Nine hours of surgery.

580
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,900
骨盆和脊椎里装上了钢钉和螺丝
Rods and screws in my pelvis and spine.

581
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,320
我本以为是工作造成的
I thought it was the work that caused it,

582
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,680
但是会诊医生告诉我是童年受的伤
but the consultant told me it was an injury from childhood.

583
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,510
我立刻就知道是我背上挨的那拳
Straight away, I knew it was that punch in the back.

584
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,460
你当时知道出了问题
You knew something was seriously wrong when it happened,

585
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,860
但你没带我去医院
but you didn't take me to the hospital

586
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,840
因为他担心有人可能会起疑
because he was worried someone might be suspicious.

587
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,430
我不知道那伤有那么严重
I never knew it was serious.

588
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,250
我根本不能动
I couldn't move!

589
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,570
你让我在自己的尿液里躺了五天
You left me to lie in my own urine for five days.

590
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,550
你都没换过我的湿床单
You didn't even change my sopping sheets.

591
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,980
但你给我买了很多吐司和草莓酱
You brought me plenty of toast and strawberry jam, though!

592
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,650
几周后  你们把我留给祖母照看
A couple of weeks later, you left me with nan

593
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,090
全跑去阳光灿烂的西班牙玩
and all took off for sunny Spain.

594
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,500
我当时才12岁
I was 12 years old.

595
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,000
我们想着你最好在家休养
We thought it was better that you rested.

596
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,200
你有什么毛病
What's wrong with you?

597
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,530
我不知道
I didn't know.

598
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,990
别走  阿德里安
Don't go, Adrian.

599
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,470
我给你打电话不是因为他让我打
I didn't just call you because he told me to.

600
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,740
我很想你
I've missed you.

601
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,310
第二次很幸运
Second time lucky.

602
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,170
我获得假释了
I got it?

603
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,040
恭喜  约翰
Congratulations, John.

604
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,050
你在圣诞节前就能出狱了
You're gonna be out by Christmas.

605
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,120
好样的
Well done.

606
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,610
是的
Yup. Well...

607
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,780
谢谢通知我
thanks for letting me know.

608
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,770
不敢相信他们现在要放他出来
I can't believe they're letting him out now.

609
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,220
我们差一点就成功了
We're so close.

610
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,880
真的吗
Are we, though?

611
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,020
我就当你是因为疲惫和今天不顺心才说这种丧气话
I'm gonna put that down to exhaustion and a shit day.

612
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,980
你知道我过完不顺心的一天后会做什么吗
Do you know what I do after a shit day?

613
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,950
什么
What?

614
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,540
我会回家
I go home...

615
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,740
然后跟家人一起吃大量的不健康食物
and I eat a large amount of unhealthy food with my family.

616
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,780
回家吧  史蒂夫
Go home, Steve.

617
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,190
陪你儿子
Be with your boy.

618
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,190
晚上好
Evening!

619
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,180
杰克
Jack?

620
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,990
我买了炸鱼薯条
I've got fish and chips!

621
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,530
我是杰克・威尔金斯  我暂时不方便接听
'Hey, it's Jack Wilkins. I'm not here at the moment.

622
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,630
有事留言  我会回你
'Just leave a message and I'll get back to you.'

623
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,310
终于回来了
Finally!

624
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,170
知道吗  要是你偶尔大发慈悲
You know, I'd appreciate it if, once in a blue moon,

625
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,970
接个电话或回个短信我就感恩戴德了
you'd answer your phone or responded to a text.

626
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,580
你是喝酒了吗
Have you been drinking, by any chance?

627
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,140
是  我去庆祝了
Yeah, I've been celebrating!

628
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,580
庆祝什么
Celebrating what?

629
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,430
我被选进郡队了
I made the county team.

630
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,650
谢谢你今天的"远程支持"了  老爸
Thanks for being there for me today, Dad!

631
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,240
该死
Shit...!

632
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,460
杰克
Jack!

633
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,990
杰克
Jack!

634
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,210
别烦我
Leave me alone.

635
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,910
别跟我怄气
There's no need for that.

636
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,080
对不起  杰克
I'm sorry, Jack.

637
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,330
你信誓旦旦地说想让我们多在一起
You made such a big deal about us spending more time together.

638
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,900
但你根本做不到
But you just can't do it.

639
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,010
你太痴迷于工作了
You're so fucking obsessed with your work.

640
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,370
你个不负责任的老爸
You're a shit dad.

641
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,450
别这样  这么说不公平
Hey, now, come on. That's not fair.

642
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,870
听着  我很抱歉忘记了选拔赛
Look, I'm sorry I forgot about the trial.

643
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,720
抱歉我不是个完美的爸爸
I'm sorry I'm not a perfect dad.

644
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,770
这不是借口
It's no excuse.

645
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,850
我疏忽了  好吗
I took my eye off the ball, OK?

646
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,350
好吧
Ok.

647
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,150
你吃过了吗
Have you eaten?

648
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,640
吃了
Yeah.

649
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,200
那好
Right, well...

650
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,280
休息吧
get some kip.

651
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,430
这是我们最后的机会  各位
This is last chance saloon, guys.

652
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,030
库珀一周后就会回家
Cooper will be home in a week.

653
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,570
我们得重新梳理一切
We have got to go over everything.

654
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,720
没有能和警方绘制的画像
I mean, not having a photograph of Cooper

655
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,010
做对比的库珀的照片
that we can compare to the artist's impression,

656
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,800
是我们案件中的漏洞
it's a hole in our case.

657
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,440
奈杰  格林  去拜访他和帕特的亲戚
Nige, Glyn, doorstep his and Pat's relatives.

658
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,890
就说我们需要家庭照片  为了存档用
Tell them that we need family photographs for our records.

659
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,980
好的  头儿
Yes, boss.

660
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,130
我来开车
I'll drive.

661
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
安德鲁
Andrew...

662
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,380
那帕特呢
What about Pat?

663
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,790
他肯定得住在其他地方  对吧  她现在不能跟他住
He'll be housed somewhere else, right? She can't live with him now.

664
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,720
他们结婚很久了  安德鲁
They've been married a long time, Andrew.

665
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,230
如果他要对她动手  他早就做了
If he was gonna do something to her, he'd have done it by now.

666
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,630
你不能确定
You don't know that.

667
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,840
他坐了十年牢  谁知道牢狱让他变成什么样了
He's been in prison ten years. Who knows what that's done to him?

668
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,880
她还是很怕他
She's still scared of him.

669
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,200
我去看过她
I went to see her.

670
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,010
她打电话给我
She called me.

671
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,250
我还以为...
I thought...

672
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,130
我还以为她想母子重聚呢
I thought she wanted a mother-and-son reunion.

673
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,140
结果只是按他的话办事
But she was just following orders.

674
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,970
他叫她问我  他的旧泳裤是不是在我这
He wanted her to find out if I had an old pair of bathers of his.

675
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,870
这对你来说有意义吗
Does that mean anything to you?

676
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,520
你有吗
