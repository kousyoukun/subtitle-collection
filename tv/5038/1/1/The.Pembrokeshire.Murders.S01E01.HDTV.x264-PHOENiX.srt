40
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,709
I've cleared it with Mum.

41
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,512

 said I'd stay over at Ryan's.

42
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:08,137
Can't you stay at Ryan's
another night?

43
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:15,247

 was thinking, how about you spend
one week with me,

44
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,478
one week with your mum...?

45
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:19,728
You know, that gives Mum and Mike
some space, too.

46
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,367
Did Mum ask you to do this?

47
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:22,687
No!

48
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,072
But she's fine about it,
if you are.

49
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:28,781
Can I think about it?

50
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,557
Absolutely. Yeah.

51
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,247
Look, go and stay at Ryan's tonight

You saw the news.

79
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,192
Yeah. What's the story?

80
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:29,367
The unlikelihood
of finding anything new.

81
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,687
The distress that would cause
the Dixon family.

82
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:34,528
And, if we failed,
the delight the media would take

83
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,447
in hauling us through the muck.

84
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:39,117
A few years back, they branded us
"institutionally incompetent”,

85
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,141
and it stuck.

86
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:45,966
Well, it's about time
we did something about that.

87
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,807
I'd like to take a look at Coastal
Path, see if there's anything there.

88
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:50,288
That OK with you?

89
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:51,711
You don't need my permission.

90
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,398
DCI George Jones was SIO on it.
Is he still about?

91
00:07:56,422 --> 00:08:00,221
Yeah, he is. But, Steve,
go easy on the old bloke.

92
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,687
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

93
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,966
A police dog found them.

94
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,302
Six days
after they were reported missing.

95
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,351
The maggots gave us
the time of death.

96
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:36,607
After he murdered them, the attacker
stole Peter Dixon's wallet

97
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,607
and wedding ring.

98
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,966
It's not much of a reason
to end two lives, is it?

99
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,278
Gwenda Dixon was sexually assaulted

100
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:46,086
with her husband lying dead
not six feet away.

101
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,086
He was a sick, sadistic bastard.

102
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,931
He didn't need a reason.

103
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:54,751
We did the best we could.

104
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:01,831

 won't be made a scapegoat.

105
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:04,660
That's not why I'm here, sir.

106
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,248
So, four days after the murders,
a man walked into

107
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:16,628
Pembroke Bespoke Jewellers
and sold a 22—carat gold band.

108
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:20,447
The band matched the description of
Peter Dixon's stolen wedding ring.

109
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:23,327
( And the seller of the ring
had signed the receipt ) Cooper.

110
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:26,168
Now, on the basis of
this information,

111
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,631
one of your team, a DC Dylan Rees?

112
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,990
He questioned a John William Cooper
of 28 Rose Meadow Lane, Birchmede.

113
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:37,886
Cooper said that the ring
was his own

114
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,727
and that he sold it
because he needed the cash,

115
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,006
and then his wife
confirmed the story.

116
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,142
And then no further action
was taken.

117
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,918
I'm curious to hear your view
on this.

118
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:51,687

 sent a DC to do a DCl's job.

119
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:54,648

 should've questioned Cooper
myself, but we...

120
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,110
we were swamped.

121
00:09:57,192 --> 00:10:00,006
After the case was closed,

 learnt that Rees

122
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,751
drank in the same pub as Cooper,
together.

123
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,447
My view is that Cooper...

124
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,197
used the fact
they knew each other.

125
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,807
That Rees...

126
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,272
was manipulated.

127
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:17,086
Where's Cooper now?
Dyffryn Prison.

128
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,351
He was sentenced to 16 years in 1998
for a string of, er...

129
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:22,966
burglaries and robberies.

130
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,248
The investigation was codenamed
Huntsman.

131
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:29,528
They interviewed Cooper,
but didn't get anything.

132
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:33,634
16 years in 1998...

133
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:35,817
If he's behaved himself,
he'll be up for parole.

134
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,832
Where it happened
is just below Talbenny church.

135
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,748
The spot is marked by a plaque.

136
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,106
The Dixons' son and daughter
leave a wreath every year.

137
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,388
You found us, then.

138
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:04,384
So, you're doing a bit of digging
on John William Cooper?

139
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:05,982
I am.

140
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:08,126
Let's hope you have better luck
than we did.

141
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:17,033
Operation Huntsman.

142
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:18,553
This was us.

143
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,832
There's a few odds and sods
stored elsewhere,

144
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:24,524
but most of this was confiscated
from Cooper's home.

145
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:25,937
The place was a pigsty.

146
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:31,394
You arrested him for a string of
burglaries and robberies,

147
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,474
but you also questioned him
about the murders at Coastal Path.

148
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:36,683
Why?
His MO, sir.

149
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:39,803
We did him for a robbery that was
a carbon copy of the Coastal Path.

150
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,244
Robbery, tied—up victim, a shotgun.

151
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:44,548
That's why we also questioned him
about Scoveston Park.

152
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,724
20 years ago, Scoveston Park?

153
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,217
21 years ago now.
December, '85.

154
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:55,106
Theft, arson and double murder.

155
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:59,769
Brother and sister.
Richard and Helen Thomas.

156
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,046
The difference was that
the killer resorted to arson

157
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,929
to cover his tracks.
He started a fire.

158
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,825
He completely destroyed the place.

159
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,716
Tough on evidence gathering.

160
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,019
Yeah.
And even tougher on forensics.

161
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,745
Did Cooper tell you anything
in the interviews?

162
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,385
Nothing. When we mentioned
the murders, he just shut down.

163
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,275
We had to move on.

164
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,625
With all the lesser of fences,

165
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:27,105
we found almost every single
stolen item in his home.

166
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:28,929
You charge them with
what you can prove.

167
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:32,676
Did you speak to the family?
We did.

168
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,546
Yeah, the wife gave us nothing.

169
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,745
She was more frightened of him
than us.

170
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,716
The son was useful.

171
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,436
Yeah, he hated his dad, though.

172
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,129
He wanted nothing to do with him.

173
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,155
'The reason your Disability
Allowance payment has been delayed

174
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:48,995
'is because
you changed your first name.'

175
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,436
Yeah, eight years ago,
by statutory declaration.

176
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,796

 gave you people
a copy of the certificate!

177
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,235
Look...

178
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,696
I've had enough of this.

179
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,536
Can you get a manager on the line,
please?

180
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,186
'I'm not authorised to do that, sir.

181
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,596
'What's your first name, Mr Cooper?'
Andrew.

182
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,566
Not Adrian, Andrew.

183
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,235
Andrew Cooper.

184
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:08,385
And...

185
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:10,316
don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

186
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,460
'Hold the line, please, sir.'
No, please don't...

187
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,049
'Please continue to
hold. Your call is important to us.'

188
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,985
Hi, Dad.
Oh, hello!

189
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,682
Laundry.

190
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:40,481
The machine at the salon's on the
blink and you're closer than Mum's.

191
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,815
Well...

192
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:44,664
good to know
I'm useful for something.

193
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,385
Payment.

194
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,442
"Maximum hold."

195
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,241
Thank you, love.

196
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:19,432
The place is looking nice now.

197
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:20,870
Very tidy.

198
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:23,235
It'll do, until I find something
a bit more permanent.

199
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,211
Do you want to stay,
have a bite to eat?

200
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:28,412
Sorry.

201
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:29,850
Late for the cinema.

202
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,436
OK, love, enjoy yourself.

203
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,772
Jack's really chuffed
that you're back.

204
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:40,162
Is he?

205
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,955
Don't try too hard.

206
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,875
Just give him a bit of time.

207
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,051
Right, OK.

208
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:50,211
I'll pick up the stuff tomorrow.

209
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:51,265
Hey...

210
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,162
When did you become so mature?

211
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,642
Ages ago.

212
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,316
I'm a girl.

213
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:28,051
John William Cooper.
Do you know him?

214
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:31,361
Yeah, I've heard of him.
And Operation Huntsman, obviously.

215
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:34,211
What would you say if I told you
his offending kit for the robberies

216
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,572
was black gloves, balaclava
and shotgun?

217
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,515
I'd say Nolton Hill Estate.

218
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,381
The shotgun he used,

219
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:46,850
recovered from a robbery gone wrong
in the village of Sardis.

220
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,611
It was the customised shoulder strap
which got my attention.

221
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,265
Sawn-off, modified stock.

222
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:53,642
Jesus, Steve, is it him?

223
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:55,412
Him who?

224
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:57,131
What's going on?

225
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,155
Do you remember Nolton Hill?

226
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,772
Ten years ago.
A few months before I left.

227
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:05,442
A masked man with a shotgun
attacked five teenagers

228
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:06,771
near the Nolton Hill Estate.

229
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:09,571
One of the girls was raped.
Another sexually assaulted.

230
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,771
It was never solved.

 remember.

231
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,721
DI Richards and myself
were called in to assist.

232
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:16,050
The two boys knew about guns.

233
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:17,692
Yeah, they used to do
a bit of rabbiting.

234
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:20,971
Their description of the shotgun
that the attacker used

235
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:22,412
exactly matched that gun.

236
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,491
Hang on. Back up a bit, Steve.

237
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:26,642
The last I heard,
you were looking at Coastal Path.

238
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:28,001

 was.

239
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:29,236
I am.

240
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,905
And that led me to this.

241
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:36,332
'I'll ask you again, John,

242
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,050
'regarding the murders
of Peter and Gwenda Dixon

243
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:42,612
'on the morning
of Thursday 29th June, 1989,

244
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,266
'were you the person responsible?

245
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:47,882
'I am not a murderer.'

246
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:50,050
Strong accent.
South Pembrokeshire.

247
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:51,332
Watch this...

248
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:53,931
'John, what about Scoveston Park?

249
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:57,001
'We have witnesses who say that
you knew Richard and Helen Thomas.

250
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,442
<i>'My client is exercising
his right to silence.</i>

251
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,596
'John...
Come on, John, don't be like that.

252
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:04,692
'John.

253
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:05,825
"John!”

254
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:08,511
Steve...

255
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:11,162
ever since Huntsman,
gossip has put Cooper in the frame

256
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,612
for 101 of fences.
I'm talking about just three.

257
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:17,266
Coastal Path, Scoveston Park,
Nolton Hill.

258
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,796

 think he did them all.

259
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:56,523
Not now, Jack.

260
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:03,932
Here they come.

261
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:09,309
How did Operation Huntsman
miss all this?

262
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:10,549
They didn't, ma'am.

263
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,699
They questioned Cooper
on all three cases

264
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:14,589
and he just stayed mute.

265
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:18,053
Plus, as I touched on earlier,
there was no hard evidence.

266
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:20,949
Where's your hard evidence, Steve?

267
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:23,778
It's waiting for us to find, ma'am.

268
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:26,390
Thanks to Huntsman
and the original investigations,

269
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:29,750
we have access to over 3,000
exhibits in storage.

270
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:33,390
That's a potential treasure trove
of victim and perpetrator DNA.

271
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,828
At the time of Huntsman,

272
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,390
the science wasn't up to scratch
on age—degraded trace DNA.

273
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:39,614
But as we know,
things have come a long way since.

274
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,949
Say you get enough to charge him.

275
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:46,619
Charging a man with the murders
of four adults is clear, simple.

276
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,028
But you add five minors, rape,
sexual assault,

277
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:52,059
the Crown's case could seem muddled.

278
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:54,470
The CPS won't like that.

279
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,670
Perhaps it would be wiser to confine
the review to the two murders.

280
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:01,909
With respect, ma"am, I interviewed
the five victims as a WDC.

281
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:04,949
And it made quite an impression
on me.

282
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,390
So much so, I've kept tabs on them
over the years.

283
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,750
Now, some are doing better
than others, but...

284
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,470
all of them have been
scarred for life.

285
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:14,828
They had their childhood
stolen from them that night.

286
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:17,859
They deserve another chance
at justice.

287
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,140
As do all the victims
and their families.

288
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:22,140
All I'm saying is,
if you try to prove too much,

289
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:24,390
you could lose everything.

290
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:28,670
The killings at Scoveston Park and
Coastal Path are like two bricks.

291
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:32,220
And the attacks on the kids is
the mortar that holds them together.

292
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:34,778
It has elements of both cases.

293
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,699
And, ma'am, erm...

294
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:38,220
what are the odds that of fences,

295
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:41,309
which share so much similar
fact evidence,

296
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:44,722
in such a small area,
were committed by more than one man?

297
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:51,339
You know, if we reinvestigate
and it doesn't go our way,

298
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:55,750
the media, the public, the families,
they'll crucify us.

299
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:57,884
And if we don't go ahead,
it could be far worse.

300
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,390
We've put a call into MAPPA.

301
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,670
A date's been set
for his parole hearing.

302
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,390
He could be out in three months.

303
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,589
If he did do these murders,

304
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,853
he is, by definition,
a serial killer.

305
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:13,589
And given the opportunity,
men like him...

306
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,284
they always kill again.

307
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:29,932
Next.

308
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:57,773
The next time you visit,
make an effort, will you?

309
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:02,259
You look like an old woman.

310
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:04,109
Adrian's back.

311
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,339
What?

312
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:07,230

 saw Shirley from Birchmede.

313
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:10,109
Her daughter's a receptionist
in the hospital.

314
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:12,470
Apparently,
he was walking with a stick.

315
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:13,859
A stick?

316
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:16,390
Well, that's gotta be a scam.
Well, that's what she said.

317
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,390
Anyway, Adrian wasn't like that.

318
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:19,828
He was a worker.

319
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:21,670
What, you're defending him now,
are you, hm?

320
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:23,972
He's dead to us.

321
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,140
Sorry, Andrew. Did I hurt you?

322
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:42,932
It wasn't you.

323
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:46,693
It's all right, just relax,
I've got you.

324
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,339
28 Rose Meadow Lane.

325
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:22,644
Cooper's last home
before he went inside.

326
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:26,309
Walk in any direction
from this point

327
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:29,589
and you'll hit a home he targeted
between '83 and '96.

328
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,259
It's the hub of the wheel.

329
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,028
In this tiny area,

330
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:36,500
34 burglaries and robberies,
one rape of a minor,

331
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:38,284
one indecent assault of a minor...

332
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:40,574
and two murders.

333
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,003
If walls could talk.

334
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:53,909
Been back since?

335
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,853
A few times to see how the kids
were doing.

336
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,109
So, I was thinking a start—up team
of six, including us,

337
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:06,390
cherry—picked from division.

338
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,230
That way, we can keep things covert

339
00:24:09,253 --> 00:24:10,778
and it should be easier
on our budget.

340
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:12,574
Mm, sounds like a plan.

341
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:16,140

 really appreciate you bringing me
in on this, Steve.

342
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,699
Your reputation brought you in.

343
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:21,190
WDC to DI in ten years.

344
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:23,230
Says Mr DS to Superintendent.

345
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,699
London.

346
00:24:24,722 --> 00:24:26,364
The worst years of my life.

347
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:32,163
Yeah, I was sorry to hear about
you and your missus.

348
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,932
It is what it is.

349
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:53,932
They were so close to home
when he attacked them.

350
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:57,574
It looks so bloody ordinary.

351
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,213
To Operation Ottawa.

352
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:08,853
To Operation Ottawa.

353
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:12,701
It's all right.

354
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:15,988
This is home.

355
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:17,907
The first rule of Operation Ottawa

356
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:20,627
is you do not talk about
Operation Ottawa.

357
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:22,827
The second rule of Operation Ottawa
is...?

358
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:24,540
You do not talk about
Operation Ottawa.

359
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,907
It's from Fight Club.
It's a film.

360
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:30,827
Thank you, Barry Norman.

361
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:35,238
We don't say a word to friends,
colleagues or family.

362
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,708
Yeah, they'll get narky with us,
but it's the way it has to be.

363
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:40,708
We don't want Cooper, or the media,
seeing us coming.

364
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,238
Boss...

365
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:44,988
Cold cases are 99% forensics.

366
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:47,396
So, we need to do everything we can

367
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:51,627
to help the scientists
find that DNA golden nugget,

368
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:56,346
the DNA hit that unites culprit and
victim in the same time and place.

369
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:57,627
Now, our forensics

370
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:00,708
mustn't be tainted by any of
the work that's gone before.

371
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:04,157
Previous investigations
had all their testing done in—house

372
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:06,067
by the Forensic Science Service.

373
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:08,317
But the science has moved on.

374
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:10,517
We need a fresh pair of eyes
on this.

375
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,652
Angela Gallop.

376
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,877
She has been involved in

377
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,117
some of the highest profile cases
of the last ten years.

378
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:21,157
Lynette White, Stephen Lawrence,
Damilola Taylor.

379
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,346
Dr Gallop and her team
are the best in the business.

380
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:25,117
But they can only find
what they're looking for

381
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,596
if they look in the right place.
And that's where we come in.

382
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:29,596
We need to identify which items
of evidence

383
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:34,038
are most likely to carry Cooper
and/or victim DNA in whatever form.

384
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:36,677
Skin, hair, saliva, semen, blood.

385
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:38,467
Now, in an ideal world,
there'd be no limit

386
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,627
to the amount of exhibits
we could send for analysis.

387
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,157
But...

388
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,627
forensic work is not cheap.

389
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:46,467
And our budget is finite.

390
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,907
In short, whatever we send

391
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:50,652
needs to be chosen
very fucking carefully.

392
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:58,267
'Our first case tonight

393
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,907

in South Wales.</i>

394
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,428
On the evening of 22nd December,
1985,

395
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,988
Richard Thomas
and his sister, Helen Thomas,

396
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:07,827
were attacked in their home

397
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,827
at Scoveston Park,
three miles outside Milford.

398

Emergency services were called
at 1:15am on 23rd of December.

403
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,517
Scene of Crime Officers entered
the property the following morning

404

and found Helen Thomas' body
on a bed.

405
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,788
It's believed
she was sexually assaulted.

406
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,346
On the morning of June 29th, 1989,

407
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:36,958
Peter and Gwenda Dixon were murdered
on the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path

408
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,267
near Little Haven.

409
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,317
The couple from Oxford
decided to take a short walk

410
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:43,517

to dry.

'Now, one of Wales'
most spectacular beauty spots...'

413
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:55,758
Between 7:45pm and 8:45pm
on Wednesday 6th March, 1996,

414
00:28:55,781 --> 00:29:00,708
five children, aged between 15
and 16, were attacked in a field

415
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:02,117
next to the Norton Hill Estate.

416
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:05,117
On the evening of November 22nd,
1996,

417
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:09,067
a bungalow in Sardis,
six miles from Milford, was burgled.

418
00:29:09,092 --> 00:29:12,827
The victim was confronted
by a man in a balaclava.

419
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,346
They were approached
by a masked man.

420
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:16,627
The children were threatened,
told to lie on the ground.

421
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:19,627
One of the girls was raped,
another indecently assaulted.

422
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:23,157
The victim managed to press a panic
alarm, causing the offender to flee,

423
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:25,117
depositing personal items as he ran.

424
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:29,596
These included stolen jewellery,
items of clothing, a balaclava,

425
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:33,238
some black gloves
and his double—barrel shotgun.

426
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:35,427
One of the boys was struck
in the head

427
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:37,677
with a sawn—off
double—barrel shotgun.

428
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:41,907
Then husband and wife
were shot at point—blank range.

429
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:45,427
Forensic evidence suggests
Gwenda Dixon was sexually assaulted

430
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,238
at this location here.

431
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:49,907
Most of the evidence
was destroyed in the fire.

432
00:29:49,932 --> 00:29:52,907
They did manage to retrieve
a sock belonging to Mr Thomas

433
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:54,907
and a few other items,
but that's it.

434
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:57,142
No DNA would have survived a fire
like that. No.

435
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:00,467
Just save our money for items
more likely to yield a hit.

Coastal Path, Nolton Hill.

437
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,517
Agreed.

438
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,877
But we still need to recover
any Scoveston Park exhibits

439
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:08,182
that would support
our take on his MO.

440
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:10,517
Exactly.

441
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,788
Tied—up victims.

442
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,238
The rope used to bind
Helen Thomas' hands.

443
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:16,877
Helen Thomas' bra was torn.

444
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,731
That's sexual assault.

445
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:40,061

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,897
All right.

475
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:26,922
OK.

476
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:30,951
Well, you know where it is.
Go and unpack.

477
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:49,567
'Morning.'
Yeah, Steve.

478
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,616
You need to re—route to HQ.

479
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,872
We've got a fly in the ointment.

480
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,178
Morning.

481
00:33:08,201 --> 00:33:09,847
Jonathan Hill for Steve Wilkins.

482
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,471
Just a moment.
Thank you.

483
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,178
Mr Hill.

484
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,471
Detective Superintendent
Steve Wilkins, Deputy Head of CID.

485
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:33,698
Comms referred your query to me.

486
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,567

 understand
you want to make a programme

487
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:37,391
about the Coastal Path murders.

488
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,487
Erm, actually,
it's a bit more specific than that.

489
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,177
Erm, I would like
to make a documentary

490
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:46,137
exploring the possibility that...

491
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:47,927
the double murders at Coastal Path

492
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:50,721
might be linked to the ones
at Scoveston Park in 1985.

493
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,832
That would be a problem for us.

494
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,567
How do you mean?

495
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:59,281
Mr Hill, what I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

496
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:05,201
I'm not in the habit of agreeing to
things before I know what they are.

497
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,592
We are re—investigating
the two of fences.

498
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,927
Right, and how would
a documentary about the murders

499
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,416
interfere with that?

500
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,818
The killer, or killers,
think they've got away with murder.

501
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:22,177
A news piece would rattle them,
make them vigilant.

502
00:34:22,202 --> 00:34:25,561
And that would be weeks of
covert police work down the toilet.

503
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:27,898
So...

504
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:29,648
I'll tell you what.

505
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:31,818
If you agree to shelve
your proposed documentary,

506
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:34,128
maintain a news blackout,

507
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:36,416
when we're ready to go public,

508
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,231

 will see to it that
you get the exclusive.

509
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,722
OK.

510
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:46,922
OK, it's a deal.

511
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:51,697

 want Dyfed Powys Police

512
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,286
and the media to stop fighting
and start collaborating.

513
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,797
But...

514
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:58,987
if you fuck me on this,

515
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:03,237

 will see to it that every officer
from CID to peach—fuzz PC

516
00:35:03,262 --> 00:35:05,672
knows that Jonathan Hill
is not a man to be trusted.

517
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,702
Boss...

518
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:19,827
What the fuck are those?

519
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,597
Professional portrait photos.

520
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,797
They had them done in 1978

521
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,012
after he won all that money
on the Spot The Ball.

522
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:30,547
Those teeth don't look real.

523
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:33,427
They're the only two photographs
Huntsman found in the whole house.

524
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:35,577
I've done a lot of evidence recovery
in my time.

525
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,197
Two photos in a family home?

526
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,077
It's not right.
Mm.

527
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:41,862
Together, but apart.
And their son nowhere to be seen.

528
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,751
You've been the model prisoner,
Mr Cooper.

529
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:04,951
How confident are you
that you can maintain

530
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:08,431
this change for the better
in the outside world?

531
00:36:08,454 --> 00:36:10,260
100%, your honour.

532
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:13,900
One of the of fences
involved violence towards a woman.

533
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:16,101
What can you say to reassure us

534
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,389
that you no longer pose a threat to
the female members of the community?

535
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:21,590
I'm not the same man that I was.

536
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,724
The love and the loyalty
of my wife...

537
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:27,460
has helped me with that.

538
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:29,715
Your wife has been
a regular visitor.

539
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:34,175
But your son, Adrian,
hasn't visited you once.

540
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,791

 haven't been the best father,
I admit that.

541
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:41,175
Although, I do plan to
make it up to him, if he'll let me.

542
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:45,005
I'm 62, Adrian is nearly 40,

543
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:50,644
Craig says that a man
is never too old to want his dad.

544
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,565
That's rejected.
Negative for DNA.

545
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,981
That's rejected, too.
Negative for DNA.

546
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:14,340
Is it just me, or is this beginning
to look a bit bloody hopeless?

547
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:16,030
DC Rowe...

548
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:17,820
if we can't keep the faith,

549
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:20,871
we have no right representing
the victims or their families.

550
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:22,231
Sorry, boss.

551
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:23,621
Momentary lapse.
All right.

552
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,554
Yeah, thanks.

553
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,030
Boss...
Yeah?

554
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:31,181
Cooper's been granted parole.

555
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:33,181
That was Dyffryn Prison.

556
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:35,925
They've no idea who they're dealing
with. He's played them.

557
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:48,050
John Cooper is the prime suspect
in a major crime review.

558
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,860

 am requesting his release
on parole be revoked.

559
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,507
Well, what's the crime?

560
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,996

 can't share that information.

561
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:04,226
Well, clearly, you don't have
a case, or you'd be charging him.

562
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,637
Cooper is a dangerous man.
That is a matter of public record.

563
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,556
People change.

564
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,226
That's a matter of rehabilitation.

565
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,476
I'm sure your client can be
very agreeable when it suits him.

566
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,757
Your timing is not convenient,
Superintendent Wilkins.

567
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,050
Can you at least give us a date
when you expect to charge him?

568
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:25,757
Not at present.

569
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,637
But in the meantime,
John's rights can just go hang?

570
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:31,940
The safety of the public
comes first.

571
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:34,780

 think we all agree on that.

572
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:01,507
Although we've got
a stay of execution,

573
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:05,117
he's guaranteed another
parole hearing within 3—6 months.

574
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:07,786
If, by then, Dr Gallop and her team
still haven't found

575
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:10,996
our golden nugget,
he'll be released.

576
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:13,146
But we're not gonna let that happen.

577
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,811
It's time to send Cooper a message.

578
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:20,836
'Good evening.

579
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,507
"Organisers say we're on the eve
of the biggest industrial dispute

580
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,277
'since the national strike of 1926.

581
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,757
'So, what's it all about,

582
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,021
'and how will it affect you
and your family?'

583
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,329
Cheers.
Cheers.

584
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,356
We think one man
did all four murders

585
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,947
and we need your help to catch him.

586
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,586

 want to make a personal televised

587
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,067
appeal for information
on the evening news.

588
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,836
Do you think you'll get
anything useful?

589
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,027
It's a smokescreen.

590
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,706
We're going to interview
the suspect.

591
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:02,027

 want to use the appeal
to send a message to him in advance.

592
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,786
Plant something in his brain,
make him good and paranoid.

593
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,027
We're reinvestigating the cases
and we...

594
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,831
are confident we'll catch
the culprit using DNA.

595
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,297
Have you found something?

596
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,887
No.

597
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,576
But he doesn't know that.

598
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,047
And who better than the killer
to help us refine our search?

599
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,576
Handled right, liars have a way of

600
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,880
telling you more
than is good for them.

601
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,407
OK, I'm on board,
but just one thing,

602
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:28,606
how can you be sure he'll be
watching when you need him to?

603
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,016
He's a creature of habit.

604
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:35,190

 have it on good authority
that he never misses Wales Tonight.

605
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,190
Ta.

606
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,239
About the news thing, boss.

607
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,956
Are you gonna mention the kids?
Nolton Hill?

608
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:58,460
Definitely not.

609
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,157
Why upset them
when we don't even know if the CPS

610
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:04,061
will include the of fence
on the indictment?

611
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,791
There is someone who we should
give a heads—up to, though.

612
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,260
Who is it?
Andrew Cooper?

613
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,541
Who wants to know?
The police.

614
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,621
Thank you.

615
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,717
You're not an easy man
to track down.

616
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,420
We were looking for
an Adrian, not Andrew Cooper.

617
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,235

 get that a lot.

618
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,791
Why did you change your name?

619
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:19,951
Why are you here?

620
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:24,157
We thought we should let you know
that we are...

621
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:26,485
investigating the possibility
that your father

622
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,797
may have been involved in other,
more serious crimes.

623
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,077
We're going to make a public appeal
for information.

624
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:34,260

 don't like people referring to him
as my father.

625
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,597
OK, I'm sorry.

626
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:40,956
What would you prefer?

627
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,260
His name.

628
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,460
What other crimes?

629
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,646
Four murders.

630
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,981
Scoveston Park and Coastal Path.

631
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:56,460
I'm not getting dragged back
into all that shit again.

632
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,701

 told Huntsman everything I know.

633
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,956
<i>'He's got his father's eyes.</i>

634
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:06,396
Yeah, I clocked that.

635
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,717
Why do you think
he only changed his first name?

636
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,876
If you wanna lie low,
you change your surname.

637
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,927
Maybe it wasn't about lying low.

638
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:16,876
He changed his name in 1998,
the same year Cooper was put away.

639
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,847
Maybe it was about starting again.

640
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:20,677
A new name, a new life.

641
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,036
Doesn't look like
that's working out too well for him.

642
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,360
The poor guy's a wreck.
And then we come along.

643
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:09,202
Are you OK?
Yeah.

644
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:10,226
Mm-hm.

645
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:14,454
It's just you and me
having a conversation.

646
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:17,255
Yeah.

647
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:21,056
In front of a few hundred thousand
people, live.

648
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:28,311
You know, in my first year at uni,

649
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:31,231
me and some of my mates
went camping near here.

650
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:34,056
It was July 1989.
It was just after the murders.

651
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:38,360
We saw all the police activity.

652
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:39,695
The wanted posters.

653
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,226
It was scary.

654
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,416
Fascinating as well.

655
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:49,385
It's what made me want to become
a crime reporter.

656
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:53,976
Good to go?

657
00:44:55,146 --> 00:44:56,695
Let's do it.
Yeah.

658
00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:19,121
'Good evening.
We are live in Pembrokeshire,

659
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:21,311
'where there have been
dramatic developments

660

most baffling crimes...

'Detective Superintendent

666

"We believe that somebody watching
this programme tonight

672
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:53,512
'may know who is responsible
for these terrible crimes.

673
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:54,952
"And I'm appealing to them,

674
00:45:54,976 --> 00:45:57,121
"for the sake of the victims

675

676

'And do you think

677
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:02,592

'to catch the person responsible.'
