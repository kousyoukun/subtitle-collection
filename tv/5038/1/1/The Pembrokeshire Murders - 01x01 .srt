1
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,270
辛苦啦
Prime Minister Tony Blair has led political

2
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,070
辛苦啦
tributes from a grateful nation...

3
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,630
辛苦啦
Hey, Dad.

4
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,980
辛苦啦
- Morning, sunshine. You up? - Up? I'm out and about!

5
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,330
辛苦啦
Hm, pardon me, early riser.

6
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,850
辛苦啦
What is it, Dad?

7
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,910
辛苦啦
You said there was a match today.

8
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,150
辛苦啦
Oh, yeah. Only a crappy school thing.

9
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,910
辛苦啦
Oh, well, I wanna come. Where is it?

10
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,350
辛苦啦
No, Dad, seriously, it's not that type of match.

11
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,490
辛苦啦
No parents are gonna be there.

12
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,400
辛苦啦
You're wrong. I'll be there.

13
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,590
辛苦啦
The Queen's 80th birthday celebrations.

14
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,550
辛苦啦
Her sense of duty and service, said Mr Blair...

15
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,090
辛苦啦
We set?

16
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,730
辛苦啦
Boss.

17
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,130
辛苦啦
Morning.

18
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,290
辛苦啦
Steve.

19
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,110
辛苦啦
How's the report coming? ACPO are asking.

20
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,110
辛苦啦
Yeah, should be with you by the end of play today.

21
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,470
辛苦啦
Any nasty surprises?

22
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,550
辛苦啦
I wish. It's gonna be a job for me to find something to do.

23
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,500
辛苦啦
I have a hunch you'll manage.

24
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,710
辛苦啦
What's with the TV crew, Dave?

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,850
辛苦啦
Old news.

26
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,290
辛苦啦
Hey. What's up?

27
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,950
辛苦啦
So, er, Jack just texted to say you're picking him up

28
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,070
辛苦啦
from the match.

29
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,410
辛苦啦
Yeah. Is there a problem?

30
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,650
辛苦啦
Well, back a month and you're running the show.

31
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,010
辛苦啦
Look, just...

32
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,630
辛苦啦
just make sure you're there.

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,450
辛苦啦
Fran, I'll be there.

34
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,490
辛苦啦
Go on, Jack.

35
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,550
辛苦啦
So, I was thinking, we could have a mid-week boys' night in.

36
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,970
辛苦啦
Take-away, DVD?

37
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,550
辛苦啦
I've cleared it with Mum.

38
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,250
辛苦啦
I said I'd stay over at Ryan's.

39
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,820
辛苦啦
Can't you stay at Ryan's another night?

40
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,110
辛苦啦
I was thinking, how about you spend one week with me,

41
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,310
辛苦啦
one week with your mum...?

42
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,570
辛苦啦
You know, that gives Mum and Mike some space, too.

43
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,230
辛苦啦
Did Mum ask you to do this?

44
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,490
辛苦啦
No!

45
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,930
辛苦啦
But she's fine about it, if you are.

46
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,010
辛苦啦
Can I think about it?

47
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,370
辛苦啦
Absolutely. Yeah.

48
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,090
辛苦啦
Look, go and stay at Ryan's tonight and we'll chat.

49
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,530
辛苦啦
Come here.

50
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,150
辛苦啦
With so many recent successes nationwide

51
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,490
辛苦啦
where DNA has played a key role in solving cold cases,

52
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,670
辛苦啦
attention will inevitably turn to

53
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,730
辛苦啦
unsolved murders in Wales, most notably the double murders

54
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,270
辛苦啦
of Peter and Gwenda Dixon in Pembrokeshire.

55
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,670
辛苦啦
Jonathan Hill reports.

56
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,870
辛苦啦
Over 17 years ago, the couple were blasted to death

57
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,810
辛苦啦
with a shotgun by an unknown killer as they walked along here

58
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,410
辛苦啦
at the Coastal Path in Little Haven in Pembrokeshire.

59
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,350
辛苦啦
Despite a huge police investigation,

60
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,150
辛苦啦
no-one was ever charged for the crime,

61
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,770
辛苦啦
and the Dixon family's long wait for justice continues.

62
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,110
辛苦啦
A lot of people have said they no longer feel comfortable

63
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,060
辛苦啦
coming to this path any more.

64
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,050
辛苦啦
They say it no longer feels the same.

65
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,910
辛苦啦
We asked Dyfed Powys Police for a comment

66
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,870
辛苦啦
but were told that no-one was available.

67
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,290
辛苦啦
Old news?

68
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,070
辛苦啦
Meanwhile, the identity of John and Gwenda Dixon's vicious killer

69
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,450
辛苦啦
remains unknown.

70
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,290
辛苦啦
How you settling in, Steve?

71
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,930
辛苦啦
It's like I never left.

72
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,670
辛苦啦
I found only one area where we're exposed.

73
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,270
辛苦啦
No thorough forensic reviews of serious crimes.

74
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,170
辛苦啦
Most notably Coastal Path.

75
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,970
辛苦啦
You saw the news.

76
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,050
辛苦啦
Yeah. What's the story?

77
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,170
辛苦啦
The unlikelihood of finding anything new.

78
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,510
辛苦啦
The distress that would cause the Dixon family.

79
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,390
辛苦啦
And, if we failed, the delight the media would take

80
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,270
辛苦啦
in hauling us through the muck.

81
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,990
辛苦啦
A few years back, they branded us "institutionally incompetent",

82
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,050
辛苦啦
and it stuck.

83
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,770
辛苦啦
Well, it's about time we did something about that.

84
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,670
辛苦啦
I'd like to take a look at Coastal Path, see if there's anything there.

85
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,130
辛苦啦
That OK with you?

86
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,100
辛苦啦
You don't need my permission.

87
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,210
辛苦啦
DCI George Jones was SIO on it. Is he still about?

88
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,090
辛苦啦
Yeah, he is. But, Steve, go easy on the old bloke.

89
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,550
辛苦啦
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

90
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,790
辛苦啦
A police dog found them.

91
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,170
辛苦啦
Six days after they were reported missing.

92
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,480
辛苦啦
The maggots gave us the time of death.

93
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,460
辛苦啦
After he murdered them, the attacker stole Peter Dixon's wallet

94
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,410
辛苦啦
and wedding ring.

95
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,830
辛苦啦
It's not much of a reason to end two lives, is it?

96
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,110
辛苦啦
Gwenda Dixon was sexually assaulted

97
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,950
辛苦啦
with her husband lying dead not six feet away.

98
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,950
辛苦啦
He was a sick, sadistic bastard.

99
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,770
辛苦啦
He didn't need a reason.

100
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,890
辛苦啦
We did the best we could.

101
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,040
辛苦啦
I won't be made a scapegoat.

102
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,180
辛苦啦
That's not why I'm here, sir.

103
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,070
辛苦啦
So, four days after the murders, a man walked into

104
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,410
辛苦啦
Pembroke Bespoke Jewellers and sold a 22-carat gold band.

105
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,270
辛苦啦
The band matched the description of Peter Dixon's stolen wedding ring.

106
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,150
辛苦啦
And the seller of the ring had signed the receipt J Cooper.

107
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,010
辛苦啦
Now, on the basis of this information,

108
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,490
辛苦啦
one of your team, a DC Dylan Rees?

109
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,850
辛苦啦
He questioned a John William Cooper of 28 Rose Meadow Lane, Birchmede.

110
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,710
辛苦啦
Cooper said that the ring was his own

111
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,550
辛苦啦
and that he sold it because he needed the cash,

112
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,830
辛苦啦
and then his wife confirmed the story.

113
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,250
辛苦啦
And then no further action was taken.

114
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,770
辛苦啦
I'm curious to hear your view on this.

115
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,490
辛苦啦
I sent a DC to do a DCI's job.

116
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,490
辛苦啦
I should've questioned Cooper myself, but we...

117
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,970
辛苦啦
we were swamped.

118
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,830
辛苦啦
After the case was closed, I learnt that Rees

119
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,610
辛苦啦
drank in the same pub as Cooper, together.

120
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,250
辛苦啦
My view is that Cooper...

121
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,050
辛苦啦
used the fact they knew each other.

122
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,650
辛苦啦
That Rees...

123
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,130
辛苦啦
was manipulated.

124
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,900
辛苦啦
- Where's Cooper now? - Dyffryn Prison.

125
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,640
辛苦啦
He was sentenced to 16 years in 1998 for a string of, er...

126
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,790
辛苦啦
burglaries and robberies.

127
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,050
辛苦啦
The investigation was codenamed Huntsman.

128
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,370
辛苦啦
They interviewed Cooper, but didn't get anything.

129
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,450
辛苦啦
16 years in 1998...

130
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,500
辛苦啦
If he's behaved himself, he'll be up for parole.

131
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,710
辛苦啦
Where it happened is just below Talbenny church.

132
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,610
辛苦啦
The spot is marked by a plaque.

133
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,830
辛苦啦
The Dixons' son and daughter leave a wreath every year.

134
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,250
辛苦啦
You found us, then.

135
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,230
辛苦啦
So, you're doing a bit of digging on John William Cooper?

136
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,770
辛苦啦
I am.

137
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,680
辛苦啦
Let's hope you have better luck than we did.

138
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,890
辛苦啦
Operation Huntsman.

139
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,370
辛苦啦
This was us.

140
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,670
辛苦啦
There's a few odds and sods stored elsewhere,

141
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,370
辛苦啦
but most of this was confiscated from Cooper's home.

142
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,090
辛苦啦
The place was a pigsty.

143
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,230
辛苦啦
You arrested him for a string of burglaries and robberies,

144
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,310
辛苦啦
but you also questioned him about the murders at Coastal Path.

145
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,490
辛苦啦
- Why? - His MO, sir.

146
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,670
辛苦啦
We did him for a robbery that was a carbon copy of the Coastal Path.

147
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,050
辛苦啦
Robbery, tied-up victim, a shotgun.

148
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,550
辛苦啦
That's why we also questioned him about Scoveston Park.

149
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,550
辛苦啦
20 years ago, Scoveston Park?

150
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,090
辛苦啦
21 years ago now. December, '85.

151
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,970
辛苦啦
Theft, arson and double murder.

152
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,200
辛苦啦
- Brother and sister. - Richard and Helen Thomas.

153
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,870
辛苦啦
The difference was that the killer resorted to arson

154
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,420
辛苦啦
to cover his tracks. He started a fire.

155
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,690
辛苦啦
He completely destroyed the place.

156
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,550
辛苦啦
Tough on evidence gathering.

157
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,900
辛苦啦
Yeah. And even tougher on forensics.

158
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,590
辛苦啦
Did Cooper tell you anything in the interviews?

159
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,270
辛苦啦
Nothing. When we mentioned the murders, he just shut down.

160
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,130
辛苦啦
We had to move on.

161
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,470
辛苦啦
With all the lesser offences,

162
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,930
辛苦啦
we found almost every single stolen item in his home.

163
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,570
辛苦啦
You charge them with what you can prove.

164
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,550
辛苦啦
- Did you speak to the family? - We did.

165
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,390
辛苦啦
Yeah, the wife gave us nothing.

166
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,630
辛苦啦
She was more frightened of him than us.

167
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,570
辛苦啦
The son was useful.

168
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,310
辛苦啦
Yeah, he hated his dad, though.

169
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,530
辛苦啦
He wanted nothing to do with him.

170
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,990
辛苦啦
The reason your Disability Allowance payment has been delayed

171
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,830
辛苦啦
is because you changed your first name.

172
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,270
辛苦啦
Yeah, eight years ago, by statutory declaration.

173
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,670
辛苦啦
I gave you people a copy of the certificate!

174
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,090
辛苦啦
Look...

175
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,510
辛苦啦
I've had enough of this.

176
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,390
辛苦啦
Can you get a manager on the line, please?

177
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,010
辛苦啦
I'm not authorised to do that, sir.

178
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,470
辛苦啦
- What's your first name, Mr Cooper? - Andrew.

179
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,410
辛苦啦
Not Adrian, Andrew.

180
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,090
辛苦啦
Andrew Cooper.

181
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,210
辛苦啦
And...

182
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,150
辛苦啦
don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

183
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,240
辛苦啦
- Hold the line, please, sir. - No, please don't...

184
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,570
辛苦啦
Please continue to hold. Your call is important to us.

185
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
辛苦啦
- Hi, Dad. - Oh, hello!

186
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,480
辛苦啦
Laundry.

187
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,340
辛苦啦
The machine at the salon's on the blink and you're closer than Mum's.

188
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,680
辛苦啦
Well...

189
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,550
辛苦啦
good to know I'm useful for something.

190
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,240
辛苦啦
Payment.

191
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,280
辛苦啦
"Maximum hold."

192
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,080
辛苦啦
Thank you, love.

193
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,240
辛苦啦
The place is looking nice now.

194
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,640
辛苦啦
Very tidy.

195
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,060
辛苦啦
It'll do, until I find something a bit more permanent.

196
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,040
辛苦啦
Do you want to stay, have a bite to eat?

197
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
辛苦啦
Sorry.

198
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,700
辛苦啦
Late for the cinema.

199
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,400
辛苦啦
OK, love, enjoy yourself.

200
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,620
辛苦啦
Jack's really chuffed that you're back.

201
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,000
辛苦啦
Is he?

202
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,800
辛苦啦
Don't try too hard.

203
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,720
辛苦啦
Just give him a bit of time.

204
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,880
辛苦啦
Right, OK.

205
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,050
辛苦啦
I'll pick up the stuff tomorrow.

206
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,120
辛苦啦
Hey...

207
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,020
辛苦啦
When did you become so mature?

208
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,480
辛苦啦
Ages ago.

209
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,160
辛苦啦
I'm a girl.

210
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,840
辛苦啦
John William Cooper. Do you know him?

211
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,180
辛苦啦
Yeah, I've heard of him. And Operation Huntsman, obviously.

212
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,020
辛苦啦
What would you say if I told you his offending kit for the robberies

213
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,420
辛苦啦
was black gloves, balaclava and shotgun?

214
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,360
辛苦啦
I'd say Nolton Hill Estate.

215
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,180
辛苦啦
The shotgun he used,

216
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,660
辛苦啦
recovered from a robbery gone wrong in the village of Sardis.

217
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,460
辛苦啦
It was the customised shoulder strap which got my attention.

218
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,160
辛苦啦
Sawn-off, modified stock.

219
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,500
辛苦啦
Jesus, Steve, is it him?

220
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,240
辛苦啦
Him who?

221
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,960
辛苦啦
What's going on?

222
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
辛苦啦
Do you remember Nolton Hill?

223
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,580
辛苦啦
Ten years ago. A few months before I left.

224
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,300
辛苦啦
A masked man with a shotgun attacked five teenagers

225
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,580
辛苦啦
near the Nolton Hill Estate.

226
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,380
辛苦啦
One of the girls was raped. Another sexually assaulted.

227
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,580
辛苦啦
- It was never solved. - I remember.

228
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,580
辛苦啦
DI Richards and myself were called in to assist.

229
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,840
辛苦啦
The two boys knew about guns.

230
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,500
辛苦啦
Yeah, they used to do a bit of rabbiting.

231
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,820
辛苦啦
Their description of the shotgun that the attacker used

232
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,260
辛苦啦
exactly matched that gun.

233
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
辛苦啦
Hang on. Back up a bit, Steve.

234
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,500
辛苦啦
The last I heard, you were looking at Coastal Path.

235
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,840
辛苦啦
I was.

236
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,080
辛苦啦
I am.

237
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,040
辛苦啦
And that led me to this.

238
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,120
辛苦啦
I'll ask you again, John,

239
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,860
辛苦啦
regarding the murders of Peter and Gwenda Dixon

240
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,440
辛苦啦
on the morning of Thursday 29th June, 1989,

241
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,610
辛苦啦
were you the person responsible?

242
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,680
辛苦啦
I am not a murderer.

243
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,900
辛苦啦
- Strong accent. - South Pembrokeshire.

244
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,160
辛苦啦
Watch this...

245
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,720
辛苦啦
John, what about Scoveston Park?

246
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,820
辛苦啦
We have witnesses who say that you knew Richard and Helen Thomas.

247
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,260
辛苦啦
My client is exercising his right to silence.

248
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,010
辛苦啦
John... Come on, John, don't be like that.

249
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,520
辛苦啦
John.

250
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,680
辛苦啦
John!

251
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,280
辛苦啦
Steve...

252
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,980
辛苦啦
ever since Huntsman, gossip has put Cooper in the frame

253
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,420
辛苦啦
- for 101 offences. - I'm talking about just three.

254
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,120
辛苦啦
Coastal Path, Scoveston Park, Nolton Hill.

255
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,640
辛苦啦
I think he did them all.

256
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,400
辛苦啦
Not now, Jack.

257
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,800
辛苦啦
Here they come.

258
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,180
辛苦啦
How did Operation Huntsman miss all this?

259
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,380
辛苦啦
They didn't, ma'am.

260
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,580
辛苦啦
They questioned Cooper on all three cases

261
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,400
辛苦啦
and he just stayed mute.

262
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,090
辛苦啦
Plus, as I touched on earlier, there was no hard evidence.

263
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,820
辛苦啦
Where's your hard evidence, Steve?

264
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,600
辛苦啦
It's waiting for us to find, ma'am.

265
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,220
辛苦啦
Thanks to Huntsman and the original investigations,

266
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,560
辛苦啦
we have access to over 3,000 exhibits in storage.

267
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,260
辛苦啦
That's a potential treasure trove of victim and perpetrator DNA.

268
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,660
辛苦啦
At the time of Huntsman,

269
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,220
辛苦啦
the science wasn't up to scratch on age-degraded trace DNA.

270
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,380
辛苦啦
But as we know, things have come a long way since.

271
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,780
辛苦啦
Say you get enough to charge him.

272
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,460
辛苦啦
Charging a man with the murders of four adults is clear, simple.

273
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,880
辛苦啦
But you add five minors, rape, sexual assault,

274
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,940
辛苦啦
the Crown's case could seem muddled.

275
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,280
辛苦啦
The CPS won't like that.

276
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,500
辛苦啦
Perhaps it would be wiser to confine the review to the two murders.

277
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,720
辛苦啦
With respect, ma'am, I interviewed the five victims as a WDC.

278
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,760
辛苦啦
And it made quite an impression on me.

279
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,220
辛苦啦
So much so, I've kept tabs on them over the years.

280
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,580
辛苦啦
Now, some are doing better than others, but...

281
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,280
辛苦啦
all of them have been scarred for life.

282
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,660
辛苦啦
They had their childhood stolen from them that night.

283
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,680
辛苦啦
They deserve another chance at justice.

284
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,980
辛苦啦
As do all the victims and their families.

285
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,020
辛苦啦
All I'm saying is, if you try to prove too much,

286
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,200
辛苦啦
you could lose everything.

287
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,500
辛苦啦
The killings at Scoveston Park and Coastal Path are like two bricks.

288
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,100
辛苦啦
And the attacks on the kids is the mortar that holds them together.

289
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,640
辛苦啦
It has elements of both cases.

290
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,560
辛苦啦
And, ma'am, erm...

291
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,060
辛苦啦
what are the odds that offences,

292
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,120
辛苦啦
which share so much similar fact evidence,

293
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,810

You know, if we reinvestigate and it doesn't go our way,

295
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,560
辛苦啦
the media, the public, the families, they'll crucify us.

296
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,610
辛苦啦
And if we don't go ahead, it could be far worse.

297
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,220
辛苦啦
We've put a call into MAPPA.

298

辛苦啦
A date's been set for his parole hearing.

299
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,260
辛苦啦
He could be out in three months.

300
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,400
辛苦啦
If he did do these murders,

301
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,910
辛苦啦
he is, by definition, a serial killer.

302
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,440
辛苦啦
And given the opportunity, men like him...

303
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,160
辛苦啦
they always kill again.

304

Apparently, he was walking with a stick.

312
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,680
辛苦啦
A stick?

313
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,260
辛苦啦
- Well, that's gotta be a scam. - Well, that's what she said.

314
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,260
辛苦啦
Anyway, Adrian wasn't like that.

315
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,640
辛苦啦
He was a worker.

316
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,540

What, you're defending him now, are you, hm?

317
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,840
辛苦啦
He's dead to us.

318
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,000
辛苦啦
Sorry, Andrew. Did I hurt you?

319
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,800
辛苦啦
It wasn't you.

320
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,560
辛苦啦

辛苦啦
Walk in any direction from this point

324
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,460
辛苦啦
and you'll hit a home he targeted between '83 and '96.

325
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,140
辛苦啦
It's the hub of the wheel.

326
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,840
辛苦啦
In this tiny area,

辛苦啦
Been back since?

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,560
辛苦啦
A few times to see how the kids were doing.

333
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,980
辛苦啦
So, I was thinking a start-up team of six, including us,

334
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,260
辛苦啦
cherry-picked from division.

335
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,040
辛苦啦
That way, we can keep things covert

336
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,660
辛苦啦
and it should be easier on our budget.

337
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,440
辛苦啦
Mm, sounds like a plan.

338
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,020
辛苦啦
I really appreciate you bringing me in on this, Steve.

339

Yeah, I was sorry to hear about you and your missus.

345

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,800
辛苦啦
This is home.

352
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,700
辛苦啦
The first rule of Operation Ottawa

353
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,420
辛苦啦
is you do not talk about Operation Ottawa.

354
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,620
辛苦啦
The second rule of Operation Ottawa is...?

355
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,180
辛苦啦
You do not talk about Operation Ottawa.

356

辛苦啦
It's from Fight Club. It's a film.

357

辛苦啦
Thank you, Barry Norman.

358
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,000

We don't say a word to friends, colleagues or family.

359
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,500
辛苦啦
Yeah, they'll get narky with us, but it's the way it has to be.

360
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,540
辛苦啦
We don't want Cooper, or the media, seeing us coming.

361
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,040
辛苦啦
Boss...

362
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,800
辛苦啦
Cold cases are 99% forensics.

363
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,180
辛苦啦
So, we need to do everything we can

364
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,410
辛苦啦
to help the scientists find that DNA golden nugget,

365
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,170
辛苦啦
the DNA hit that unites culprit and victim in the same time and place.

366
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,420
辛苦啦
Now, our forensics

367
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,500
辛苦啦
mustn't be tainted by any of the work that's gone before.

368
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,980
辛苦啦
Previous investigations had all their testing done in-house

369
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,900
辛苦啦
by the Forensic Science Service.

370
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,080
辛苦啦
But the science has moved on.

371
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,340
辛苦啦
We need a fresh pair of eyes on this.

Dr Gallop and her team are the best in the business.

377
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,020
辛苦啦
But they can only find what they're looking for

378
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,500
辛苦啦
if they look in the right place. And that's where we come in.

379
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,380
辛苦啦
We need to identify which items of evidence

380
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,840
辛苦啦
are most likely to carry Cooper and/or victim DNA in whatever form.

381
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,450
辛苦啦
Skin, hair, saliva, semen, blood.

382
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,260
辛苦啦
Now, in an ideal world, there'd be no limit

383
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,460
辛苦啦
to the amount of exhibits we could send for analysis.

384
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,970
辛苦啦
But...

385
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,460
辛苦啦
forensic work is not cheap.

386
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,280
辛苦啦
And our budget is finite.

387
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,690
辛苦啦
In short, whatever we send

388
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,460
辛苦啦
needs to be chosen very fucking carefully.

389

483
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,930

Mr Hill.

484
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,680
辛苦啦
Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins, Deputy Head of CID.

485
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,460
辛苦啦
Comms referred your query to me.

486
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,380
辛苦啦
I understand you want to make a programme

487
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,470
辛苦啦
about the Coastal Path murders.

488
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,260
辛苦啦
Erm, actually, it's a bit more specific than that.

489
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,980
辛苦啦
Erm, I would like to make a documentary

490
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,930
辛苦啦
exploring the possibility that...

491
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,700
辛苦啦
the double murders at Coastal Path

492
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,120
辛苦啦
might be linked to the ones at Scoveston Park in 1985.

493
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,870
辛苦啦
That would be a problem for us.

494
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,320
辛苦啦
How do you mean?

495
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,080
辛苦啦
Mr Hill, what I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.

496
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,520
辛苦啦
I'm not in the habit of agreeing to things before I know what they are.

497
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,400
辛苦啦
We are re-investigating the two offences.

498
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,740
辛苦啦
Right, and how would a documentary about the murders

499
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,180
辛苦啦
interfere with that?

500
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,580
辛苦啦
The killer, or killers, think they've got away with murder.

501
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,940
辛苦啦
A news piece would rattle them, make them vigilant.

502
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,870
辛苦啦
And that would be weeks of covert police work down the toilet.

503
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,690
辛苦啦
So...

504
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,400
辛苦啦
I'll tell you what.

505
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,620
辛苦啦
If you agree to shelve your proposed documentary,

506
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,920
辛苦啦
maintain a news blackout,

507
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,170
辛苦啦
when we're ready to go public,

508
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,070
辛苦啦
I will see to it that you get the exclusive.

509
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,530
辛苦啦
OK.

510
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,930
辛苦啦
OK, it's a deal.

511
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,460
辛苦啦
I want Dyfed Powys Police

512
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,090
辛苦啦
and the media to stop fighting and start collaborating.

513
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,610
辛苦啦
But...

514
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,760
辛苦啦
if you fuck me on this,

515
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,010
辛苦啦
I will see to it that every officer from CID to peach-fuzz PC

516
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,310
辛苦啦
knows that Jonathan Hill is not a man to be trusted.

517
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,530
辛苦啦
Boss...

518
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,650
辛苦啦
What the fuck are those?

519
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,420
辛苦啦
Professional portrait photos.

520
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,570
辛苦啦
They had them done in 1978

521
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,680
辛苦啦
after he won all that money on the Spot The Ball.

522
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,340
辛苦啦
Those teeth don't look real.

523
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,180
辛苦啦
They're the only two photographs Huntsman found in the whole house.

524
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,380
辛苦啦
I've done a lot of evidence recovery in my time.

525
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,980
辛苦啦
Two photos in a family home?

526
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,840
辛苦啦
It's not right.

527
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,530
辛苦啦
- Together, but apart. - And their son nowhere to be seen.

528
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,530
辛苦啦
You've been the model prisoner, Mr Cooper.

529
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,740
辛苦啦
How confident are you that you can maintain

530
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,250
辛苦啦
this change for the better in the outside world?

531
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,050
辛苦啦
100%, your honour.

532
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,730
辛苦啦
One of the offences involved violence towards a woman.

533
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,880
辛苦啦
What can you say to reassure us

534
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,220
辛苦啦
that you no longer pose a threat to the female members of the community?

535
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,380
辛苦啦
I'm not the same man that I was.

536
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,870
辛苦啦
The love and the loyalty of my wife...

537
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,250
辛苦啦
has helped me with that.

538
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,680
辛苦啦
Your wife has been a regular visitor.

539
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,010
辛苦啦
But your son, Adrian, hasn't visited you once.

540
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,580
辛苦啦
I haven't been the best father, I'll admit that.

541
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,250
辛苦啦
Although, I do plan to make it up to him, if he'll let me.

542
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,800
辛苦啦
I'm 62, Adrian is nearly 40,

543
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,010
辛苦啦
so...

544
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,060
辛苦啦
Craig says that a man is never too old to want his dad.

545

辛苦啦
AGJ/28.

546
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,880
辛苦啦
"AGJ/28"...

547
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,360
辛苦啦
- That's rejected. - Negative for DNA.

548
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,320
辛苦啦
AGJ/39.

549
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,010
辛苦啦
"AGJ/39"...

550
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,780
辛苦啦
- That's rejected, too. - Negative for DNA.

551
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,180
辛苦啦
Is it just me, or is this beginning to look a bit bloody hopeless?

552
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,840
辛苦啦
DC Rowe...

553
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,620
辛苦啦
if we can't keep the faith,

554
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,700
辛苦啦
we have no right representing the victims or their families.

555
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,010
辛苦啦
Sorry, boss.

556
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,460
辛苦啦
- Momentary lapse. - All right.

557
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,360
辛苦啦
Yeah, thanks.

558
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,840
辛苦啦
- Boss... - Yeah?

559
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,010
辛苦啦
Cooper's been granted parole.

560
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,960
辛苦啦
That was Dyffryn Prison.

561
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:36,720
辛苦啦
They've no idea who they're dealing with. He's played them.

562
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,900
辛苦啦
John Cooper is the prime suspect in a major crime review.

563
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,700
辛苦啦
I am requesting his release on parole be revoked.

564
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,340
辛苦啦
Well, what's the crime?

565
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,780
辛苦啦
I can't share that information.

566
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,040
辛苦啦
Well, clearly, you don't have a case, or you'd be charging him.

567
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,460
辛苦啦
Cooper is a dangerous man. That is a matter of public record.

568
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,380
辛苦啦
People change.

569
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,040
辛苦啦
That's a matter of rehabilitation.

570
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,260
辛苦啦
I'm sure your client can be very agreeable when it suits him.

571
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,560
辛苦啦
Your timing is not convenient, Superintendent Wilkins.

572
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,480
辛苦啦
Can you at least give us a date when you expect to charge him?

573
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,560
辛苦啦
Not at present.

574
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,420
辛苦啦
But in the meantime, John's rights can just go hang?

575
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,860
辛苦啦
The safety of the public comes first.

576
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,670
辛苦啦
I think we all agree on that.

577
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,310
辛苦啦
Although we've got a stay of execution,

578
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,920
辛苦啦
he's guaranteed another parole hearing within 3-6 months.

579
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,600
辛苦啦
If, by then, Dr Gallop and her team still haven't found

580
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,820
辛苦啦
our golden nugget, he'll be released.

581
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,000
辛苦啦
But we're not gonna let that happen.

582
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,660
辛苦啦
It's time to send Cooper a message.

583
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,620
辛苦啦
Good evening.

584
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,360
辛苦啦
Organisers say we're on the eve of the biggest industrial dispute

585
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,100
辛苦啦
since the national strike of 1926.

586
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,560
辛苦啦
So, what's it all about,

587
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,380
辛苦啦
and how will it affect you and your family?

588
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,180
辛苦啦
- Cheers. - Cheers.

589
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,200
辛苦啦
We think one man did all four murders

590
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,780
辛苦啦
and we need your help to catch him.

591
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,400
辛苦啦
I want to make a personal televised

592
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,880
辛苦啦
appeal for information on the evening news.

593
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,680
辛苦啦
Do you think you'll get anything useful?

594
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,820
辛苦啦
It's a smokescreen.

595
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,520
辛苦啦
We're going to interview the suspect.

596
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,840
辛苦啦
I want to use the appeal to send a message to him in advance.

597
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,600
辛苦啦
Plant something in his brain, make him good and paranoid.

598
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,840
辛苦啦
We're reinvestigating the cases and we...

599
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,870
辛苦啦
are confident we'll catch the culprit using DNA.

600
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,120
辛苦啦
Have you found something?

601
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,700
辛苦啦
No.

602
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,360
辛苦啦
But he doesn't know that.

603
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,880
辛苦啦
And who better than the killer to help us refine our search?

604
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,340
辛苦啦
Handled right, liars have a way of

605
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,910
辛苦啦
telling you more than is good for them.

606
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,200
辛苦啦
OK, I'm on board, but just one thing,

607
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,520
辛苦啦
how can you be sure he'll be watching when you need him to?

608
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,780
辛苦啦
He's a creature of habit.

609
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,020
辛苦啦
I have it on good authority that he never misses Wales Tonight.

610
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,020
辛苦啦
Ta.

611
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,220
辛苦啦
About the news thing, boss.

612
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,800
辛苦啦
Are you gonna mention the kids? Nolton Hill?

613
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,300
辛苦啦
Definitely not.

614
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,960
辛苦啦
Why upset them when we don't even know if the CPS

615
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,780
辛苦啦
will include the offence on the indictment?

616
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,710
辛苦啦
There is someone who we should give a heads-up to, though.

617
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,130
辛苦啦
- Who is it? - Andrew Cooper?

618
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,420
辛苦啦
- Who wants to know? - The police.

619
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,180
辛苦啦
ID.

620
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,460
辛苦啦
Thank you.

621
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,500
辛苦啦
You're not an easy man to track down.

622
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,610
辛苦啦
We were looking for an Adrian, not Andrew Cooper.

623
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,080
辛苦啦
I get that a lot.

624
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,620
辛苦啦
Why did you change your name?

625
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,780
辛苦啦
Why are you here?

626
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,960
辛苦啦
We thought we should let you know that we are...

627
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,280
辛苦啦
investigating the possibility that your father

628
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,600
辛苦啦
may have been involved in other, more serious crimes.

629
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,880
辛苦啦
We're going to make a public appeal for information.

630
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,040
辛苦啦
I don't like people referring to him as my father.

631
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,420
辛苦啦
OK, I'm sorry.

632
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,780
辛苦啦
What would you prefer?

633
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,100
辛苦啦
His name.

634
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,620
辛苦啦
What other crimes?

635
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,460
辛苦啦
Four murders.

636
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,820
辛苦啦
Scoveston Park and Coastal Path.

637
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,410
辛苦啦
I'm not getting dragged back into all that shit again.

638
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,010
辛苦啦
I told Huntsman everything I know.

639
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,800
辛苦啦
He's got his father's eyes.

640
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,200
辛苦啦
Yeah, I clocked that.

641
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,520
辛苦啦
Why do you think he only changed his first name?

642
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,720
辛苦啦
If you wanna lie low, you change your surname.

643
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,720
辛苦啦
Maybe it wasn't about lying low.

644
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,710
辛苦啦
He changed his name in 1998, the same year Cooper was put away.

645
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,680
辛苦啦
Maybe it was about starting again.

646
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,460
辛苦啦
A new name, a new life.

647
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,840
辛苦啦
Doesn't look like that's working out too well for him.

648
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,060
辛苦啦
- The poor guy's a wreck. - And then we come along.

649
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,020
辛苦啦
- Are you OK? - Yeah.

650
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,780
辛苦啦
It's just you and me having a conversation.

651
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,100
辛苦啦
Yeah.

652
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,110
辛苦啦
In front of a few hundred thousand people, live.

653
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,100
辛苦啦
You know, in my first year at uni,

654
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,040
辛苦啦
me and some of my mates went camping near here.

655
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,070
辛苦啦
It was July 1989. It was just after the murders.

656
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,180
辛苦啦
We saw all the police activity.

657
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,740
辛苦啦
The wanted posters.

658
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,060
辛苦啦
It was scary.

659
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,500
辛苦啦
Fascinating as well.

660
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,200
辛苦啦
It's what made me want to become a crime reporter.

661
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,820
辛苦啦
Good to go?

662
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,620
辛苦啦
- Let's do it. - Yeah.

663
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,920
辛苦啦
Good evening. We are live in Pembrokeshire,

664
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,120
辛苦啦
where there have been dramatic developments

665
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,560
辛苦啦
in two of Wales's most baffling crimes -

666
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,040
辛苦啦
the murders of Richard and Helen Thomas,

667
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,720
辛苦啦
and Peter and Gwenda Dixon.

668
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,540
辛苦啦
And now, decades on,

669
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,240
辛苦啦
these two double murders are being reinvestigated.

670
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,280
辛苦啦
Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins

671
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,580
辛苦啦
is the man leading this reinvestigation.

672
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,760
辛苦啦
Developments in DNA analysis have revolutionised cold case reviews.

673
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,200
辛苦啦
As a team, we have brought these processes to bear

674
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,680
辛苦啦
on these two investigations

675
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,340
辛苦啦
and they have had a significant impact.

676
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,720
辛苦啦
We believe that somebody watching this programme tonight

677
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,360
辛苦啦
may know who is responsible for these terrible crimes.

678
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,760
辛苦啦
And I'm appealing to them,

679
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,960
辛苦啦
for the sake of the victims and their families,

680
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,520
辛苦啦
to please come forward.

681
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,720
辛苦啦
And do you think it's the same local man

682
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,440
辛苦啦
responsible for all four murders?

683
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,080
辛苦啦
I do believe that, Jonathan.

684
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,920
辛苦啦
Thanks to the advances in DNA forensic science,

685
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,480
辛苦啦
we are now in a much stronger position

686
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,630
辛苦啦
to catch the person responsible.
