3
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,880
Welcome home, love.

4
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,330
You've got an unusual hobby, John.

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,600
Oh, yes, the scuba diving.

6
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,970
Apparently it's the place to do it down there, isn't it?

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,570
- Well, we've got the coastline. - Yes.

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,690
'Well, we've got the deep water...

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,650
And you can swim over mountains and all sorts.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,640
Yeah.

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,690
999, which service?

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,760
It's my wife. She's collapsed.

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,280
I need an ambulence.

15
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,400
My name is John Cooper.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,200
Anwen.

17
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,410
- Long time. - Steve.

18
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,320
We've done as you asked, removed Cooper from the scene.

19
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,360
He is giving a statement down at Haverfordwest Station.

20
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,520
The paramedics put her on the floor for CPR.

21
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,610
We need the Home Office pathologist on this.

22
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll call the coroner.

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,280
And Anwen...

24
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,560
make sure everyone knows it's possible there's no crime here.

25
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,450
Cooper should be treated as sensitively

26
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,600
as any husband who's just lost his wife.

27
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,800
There's no signs of a struggle.

28
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,240
No bruising on the arms or neck.

29
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,400
We could have prevented this.

30
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,010
We won't know if he killed her

31
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,080
until we get the pathologist's report.

32
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,040
Till then, he won't be allowed back in the house.

33
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,520
He's staying with his brother.

34
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,890
But this is a warning.

35
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,720
John Cooper is out, and no good can come of that.

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,880
And...

37
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,840
we could be shut down any day.

38
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,680
So, it's not good enough for us to sit around

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,680
waiting for forensics to save our arses.

40
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,360
We have to make something happen.

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,480
Those khaki shorts are out there.

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,280
Morning.

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,160
Ahead of you is 28 Rose Meadow Lane, Cooper's last home.

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,280
Behind you is Sardis village.

45
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,360
This was his hunting ground.

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,040
Those fields were his rat runs.

47
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,850
And thanks to Huntsman, we know that

48
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,810
these hedgerows were his so-called "safes",

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,600
where he hid items he'd stolen or his offending gear.

50
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,920
Now, these khaki shorts worried him in the interviews.

51
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,080
He thinks they're out there still.

52
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,040
Steve Wilkins, hello.

53
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,120
Hello, Mr Wilkins. It's the Home Office pathologist here.

54
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,240
Hello, sir.

55
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,010
Thank you for getting back to me so promptly.

56
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,680
- The results of Pat Cooper's postmortem. - Yeah?

57
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,760
She died of natural causes.

58
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,960
- Natural causes? - Yes.

59
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,360
- It was clearly heart failure. - Her heart?

60
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,120
Ok.

61
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,450
All right.

62
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,730
Well, thank you for getting back. We appreciate it.

63
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,560
No problem.

64
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,320
She saw this coming.

65
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,490
She had an ad cut out from the paper

66
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,200
about arranging your own funeral.

67
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,360
She knew.

68
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,800
She knew living with him again would be the death of her.

69
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,690
Do you think he'll try and make contact with you?

70
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,720
No chance.

71
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,130
What about the funeral?

72
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,170
He won't want me there.

73
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,440
What about what you want?

74
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,730
If you want to attend your mother's funeral, we can help with that.

75
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,040
Too much aggro.

76
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,960
I'll go see her in my own time.

77
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,480
Andrew...

78
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,080
on behalf of my team and myself...

79
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,760
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,400
It wasn't your fault.

81
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,920
Bad things happen around bad men.

83
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,640
He's right, Steve.

84
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,080
It wasn't our fault.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,170
If Cooper was still inside, Pat would still be alive

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,800
and Andrew would still have a mother.

87
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,760
But with Pat out of the picture, he's even more dangerous.

88
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,040
It's like a ticking time bomb.

89
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,560
Living on his own is new territory for him.

90
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,480
Just him and his thoughts.

91
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,640
His fantasies, compulsions.

92
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,680
Ten years' worth.

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,200
We have come together to commend our sister Patricia

94
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,360
into the hands of Almighty God, our heavenly father.

95
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,610
In the presence of death,

96
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,810
Christians have sure grounds for hope and confidence,

97
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,090
and even joy, because the Lord Jesus Christ,

98
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,860
who shared our human life and death,

99
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,820
was raised again triumphant and lives evermore.

100
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,570
In this faith, we put our whole trust.

101
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,920
And help us, we humbly beseech thee, Lord.

102
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,960
Amen.

103
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,480
Fuck!

104
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Glyn...

105
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,130
Huntsman recovered all the items

106
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,760
of clothing from the house, correct?

107
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,120
Yeah, they did, yeah.

108
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,760
- And they photographed every item? - Yeah.

109
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,880
Khaki shorts.

110
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,600
They're the same.

111
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,560
There's something wrong with this picture.

112
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,690
Could the colour be affected by the processing? The flash?

113
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,880
Yeah, I guess so. And it's an old picture.

114
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,120
We need to see what these shorts actually look like.

115
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,800
Jesus Christ...

116
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,560
They are khaki.

117
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,560
But they do look a lot shorter.

118
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,360
Maybe he had them altered.

119
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,600
Pat was a seamstress.

120
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,720
May I?

121
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,450
Oh, Steve, elasticated waistband. No fly.

122
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,320
They...

123
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,960
They look like women's shorts.

124
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,520
Yeah, well, they're all we've got.

125
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,240
We're sending them in for testing.

126
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,160
Steve Wilkins.

127
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,170
Steve, it's Angela Gallop.

128
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,200
Are you driving, by any chance?

129
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,840
It's OK, you're on speaker.

130
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,160
I think you'd better pull over.

131
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,640
Ok.

132
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,570
- What is it? - Right...

133
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,330
So, we unpicked the hem of the shorts, like you asked,

134
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,050
and we taped the uncovered area for fibres

135
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,530
and noticed there is a faint stain.

136
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,440
So, we went back to the exact same spot on the shorts and...

137
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,360
...found a tiny flake of blood.

138
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,680
It's Peter Dixon's.

139
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,200
- How sure are you? - Full profile.

140
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,970
The probability of that blood having come from anybody else

141
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,360
is a billion to one.

142
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,560
It's your golden nugget, Steve.

143
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,320
Steve?

144
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,640
Are you still there?

145
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,280
Please, don't take this the wrong way...

146
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,240
...but I bloody love you!

147
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,760
Charge him with the lot.

148
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,480
Including Nolton Hill?

149
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,240
- The lot. - Yes!

150
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you.

151
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,040
Check the vehicle.

152
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,680
We're going in.

153
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,520
Morning, John.

154
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,440
John William Cooper,

155
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,930
you're under arrest for the murders

156
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,570
- of Helen and Richard Thomas... - Fuck off!

157
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,690
- Get off me! Fuck off! - ...and Peter and Gwenda Dixon.

158
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,930
You are also under arrest

159
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,970
for attempted armed robbery, rape and sexual assault

160
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,560
during an attack on five teenagers in Milford Haven in 1996.

161
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,240
Boss...

162
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,160
Jesus...

163
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,120
And I found this in the glove compartment.

165
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,600
We got him just in time.

166
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,640
Right, John.

167
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,040
You know Detective Inspector Richards.

168
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,080
I am Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins.

169
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,560
I know who you are.

170
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,400
Can you see OK, John?

171
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,720
I've got a spare pair of glasses if you need them.

172
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,560
That's me.

173
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,690
That isn't.

174
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,970
The last time we met, you said

175
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,800
you'd never had collar-length hair.

176
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,250
Oh, so I forgot that I had collar-length hair 20 years ago.

177
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,330
It's not a crime, is it?

178
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,320
Let's talk about the shorts the man in the drawing's wearing, John.

179
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,890
Mr Cooper is being shown a photo of item AJM/165.

180
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,690
The khaki shorts recovered by Huntsman from 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

181
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,410
Now, the last time you spoke to us, John,

182
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,210
you said that you'd once owned a pair of

183
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,570
what you described as khaki bathers.

184
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,560
Is that them?

185
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,490
Well... if they're from my home, maybe.

186
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,770
Strictly speaking, they're not bathers, John.

187
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,010
The fabric's too heavy.

188
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,770
I used them as bathers. So, to me, that's what they are.

189
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,010
During the interview in July 2008,

190
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,450
you said that the shorts worn by the man in the drawing

191
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,280
couldn't possibly be yours as your bathers were much shorter.

192
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,360
See for yourself.

193
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,650
For the tape, I'm showing Mr Cooper item AJM/165/B.

194
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,410
We unpicked the hem, John.

195
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,850
So, do you see how, with the excess fabric turned down,

196
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,010
the difference in length between

197
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,000
the two pairs of shorts is reduced?

198
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,450
If you do that to any garment, that's what'll happen.

199
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,570
Yeah, we know your wife used to work as a seamstress.

200
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,320
Did she alter these shorts?

201
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,930
You leave my wife out of this.

202
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,210
Since the July 2008 interviews,

203
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,610
certain forensic discoveries have been made

204
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,970
which we would like to discuss with you

205
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,480
so that you can have an opportunity to comment.

206
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,810
In reference to AJM/165/B,

207
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,810
this white circle indicates an area

208
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,320
where an amount of Peter Dixon's blood was found.

209
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,880
Can you give us an explanation as to how that might be?

210
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,120
Pat got most of my clothes from the Oxfam and Army Surplus.

211
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,560
Oh, and you should also be talking to my son.

212
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,440
As I told you all before,

213
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,010
he was in the habit of borrowing my clothes.

214
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,880
John...

215
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,330
was Peter Dixon's blood

216
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,200
deposited on the khaki shorts when you shot him?

217
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,730
- I've never killed anybody in my life. - These shorts...

218
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,210
sorry, bathers...

219
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,320
were something of a treasure trove, John. Especially the pockets.

220
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,440
Photo AJM/166.

221
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,690
What this photo shows us, John, is a microscopic image

222
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,610
of the fluff found in the pockets of your khaki bathers.

223
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,940
Fluff that consisted of human hair. Yours.

224
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,890
Skin cells. Also yours.

225
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,920
But nothing of your son, though.

226
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,480
Certain fabric fibres were also found in the fluff.

227
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,810
For the tape, glove BB/109,

228
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,920
found under the hedgerow near your home

229
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,520
at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

230
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,410
MTJ/5 and 7

231
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,090
recovered by Huntsman from the Sardis trail.

232
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,880
John, are these three gloves yours?

233
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,160
Absolutely not.

234
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,200
As I told you before, Adrian was the glove-wearer in our family.

235
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,490
I never wore gloves. I found them too cumbersome.

236
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,800
What about the new pair we found in the boot of your car?

237
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,280
Well...

238
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,410
obviously, I wear gloves now.

239
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,200
Now I'm older, I feel the cold more.

240
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,290
Fibres exactly matching the constituent fibres

241
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,810
of these three gloves were found in the fluff

242
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,570
from the pockets of your khaki bathers.

243
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,440
- How do you account for that? - Are you deaf?

244
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,520
I told you, Adrian wore the bathers more than me.

245
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,760
When two articles of clothing come into contact with each other,

246
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,130
there is always an exchange of fibres.

247
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,930
On glove BB/109,

248
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,320
our team found fibres from another source.

249
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,840
For the tape, BM/1,

250
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,730
a sock belonging to Richard Thomas.

251
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,300
The only item of clothing recovered from his body

252
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,240
after it was destroyed in the fire at Scoveston Park in 1985.

253
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,330
Fibres from this sock were found on glove BB/109.

254
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,510
And fibres from this glove were found on this sock.

255
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,290
Are you with me so far, John?

256
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,290
Oh, keep talking, yeah. I know you want to.

257
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,930
These discoveries are consistent with the accepted view

258
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,530
that Richard Thomas' killer wore gloves

259
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,970
when he dragged his body from the outbuilding

260
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,960
into the main house at Scoveston.

261
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,250
Are you listening to this, huh?

262
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,410
- This is Fantasy Island. - John...

263
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,650
are you the person responsible

264
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,370
for the murder of Richard and Helen Thomas

265
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,840
at Scoveston Park in December 1985?

266
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,510
No.

267
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,250
I was not.

268
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,330
Fibres are the gifts that keep on giving, John.

269
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,970
Other fibres, from a different source,

270
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,630
were found on gloves MTJ/5 and 7.

271
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,560
For the tape, BKG/9.

272
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,290
Those fibres were an exact match

273
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,450
with constituent fibres found in the underwear of a young female

274
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,890
who was raped on the evening of the 6th March 1996

275
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,750
in a field by the Nolton Hill Estate, Milford Haven.

276
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,370
John, are you the person who, on 6th March 1996,

277
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,130
pointed a gun at five young people,

278
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,130
three females and two males, on Nolton Hill

279
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,480
and searched them for money?

280
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,130
Mr Cooper has not answered.

281
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,590
John, are you the person who raped one of the young females?

282
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,130
Mr Cooper has not answered.

283
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,250
John, are you the person who indecently assaulted

284
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,160
one of the other young females?

285
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,400
For the tape...

286
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,590
PH/2, the sawn-off shotgun found on the Sardis trail,

287
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,050
which matches the description

288
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,930
given by two of the victims of the Nolton Hill attack,

289
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,210
and the victim in the Sardis robbery,

290
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,200
a crime we know you were convicted of in 1998.

291
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,000
If you're gonna say that you found my DNA on that, I told her...

292
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,810
about the prosecution making me handle it during the trial.

293
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,480
Well, we did find DNA on the gun, John.

294
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,590
But not yours.

295
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,000
You see the black finish on the barrel and stock?

296
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,920
Anvileen satin black metal paint.

297
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,210
For the tape, JAW/100,

298
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,830
recovered by Huntsman from the shed at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

299
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,310
John...

300
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,000
were you the one who applied this paint to the barrel of the gun?

301
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,600
That is not...

302
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,200
my gun.

303
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,480
We had the paint removed.

304
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,650
On some of the flakes, our forensic scientists

305
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,310
noticed a reddish cast that tested positive for blood.

306
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,880
Peter Dixon's blood.

307
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,550
John...

308
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,750
did you shoot Peter and Gwenda Dixon with this gun?

309
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,000
- What are you doing, John? - John...

310
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,240
Sit down, John.

312
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,480
Erin James?

313
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,200
Erin Davies. I'm married.

314
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,400
Hi, Erin.

315
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,250
I'm Detective Inspector Ella Richards.

316
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,730
This is Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins.

317
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,750
Mm, I remember you.

318
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,960
Erin, we've recently arrested a man

319
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,510
on suspicion of committing four murders.

320
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,200
We also believe he was the man who attacked you and your friends in 1996.

321
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,920
After all this time?

322
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,930
I'm so sorry. I realise this must be a shock.

323
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,790
Why couldn't you have done this 13 years ago?

324
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,680
Erin...

325
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,200
may I say something?

326
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,310
We know we let you down.

327
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,050
All we want is to see to it the man who hurt you and your friends

328
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,440
never gets to hurt anyone else ever again.

329
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,480
And you can help make that happen.

330
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,810
All of you will be assigned Family Liaison Officers

331
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,310
to support you and your family through the process.

332
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,890
The trial won't be for weeks yet.

333
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,310
I won't be taking part in any trial.

334
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,610
None of you will be required to appear in court.

335
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,200
Everything will be done via video link.

336
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,120
You won't have to be in the same room as him.

337
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,400
My husband doesn't know I was raped.

339
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,440
How was it?

340
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,750
Leanne Dauncey will testify.

341
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,290
Erin's angry, but Leanne thinks she can talk her round.

342
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,400
Karen Joseph's out of the question. She's practically housebound.

343
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,070
She's had mental health issues ever since the attack.

344
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,680
The two boys won't cooperate, either.

345
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,000
Not after everything that happened with the original investigation.

346
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,730
The trial begins at Swansea Crown Court tomorrow

347
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,710
'of 65-year-old John William Cooper

348
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,240
of Letterston, Pembrokeshire.

350
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,000
'Cooper has been charged with the four murders

351
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,290
'and with the rape and indecent assault

352
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,720
'of two teenage girls at Milford Haven in 1996.'

353
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,250
The defence will make much of the fact that the khaki shorts

354
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,310
are indeed women's shorts.

355
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,010
That it makes no sense that the defendant was wearing them

356
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,440
when he brutally murdered Mr and Mrs Dixon.

357
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,720
But murder cases have a habit of defying common sense.

358
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,790
According to the son of Mr and Mrs Dixon...

359
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,730
..whenever his parents went walking

360
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,530
and his mother was wearing long trousers,

361
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,480
she would always put a pair of shorts in her backpack

362
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,640
in case the weather turned warm.

363
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,050
But no shorts of any description were found

364
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,960
at the Coastal Path crime scene.

365
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,360
Why?

366
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,160
Imagine the sequence of events, ladies and gentlemen.

367
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,310
The defendant shoots the Dixons at close range.

368
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,600
He then moves their bodies and covers them with branches.

369
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,680
In the process, some of their blood -

370
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,200
judging by these distressing images, probably a lot of their blood -

371
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,270
gets onto his trousers.

372
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,270
In a panic, he goes through his victims' backpacks and finds...

373
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,400
..Mrs Dixon's khaki shorts.

374
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,170
He removes his own blood-stained trousers

375
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,650
and puts on Mrs Dixon's shorts and quits the scene,

376
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,830
taking his trousers with him, unaware that a single spot

377
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,360
of Peter Dixon's blood had found its way onto the shorts.

378
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,120
How come you're not inside?

379
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,920
The SIO is the last Crown witness.

380
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,960
I'm not allowed in until I give my evidence.

381
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,640
How are you feeling?

382
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,750
Ready as I'll ever be.

383
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,310
Come on.

384
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,370
This police artist's impression was based

385
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,290
on a witness sighting of the defendant as he withdrew cash

386
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,870
from a NatWest ATM in Haverfordwest

387
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,750
using Peter Dixon's bank card.

388
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,440
The sighting was made two days after the murder and yet, incredibly,

389
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,680
the defendant was still wearing Mrs Dixon's khaki shorts.

390
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,290
A hugely incriminating piece of evidence linking him to two murders.

391
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,920
Why on earth had he not disposed of them

392
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,890
at the earliest opportunity?

393
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,120
Think about what that says about the mind of John William Cooper.

394
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,970
Was he thumbing his nose at the world,

395
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,310
convinced that he was too clever to be caught for his horrific crime?

396
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,920
Or was his motivation darker, stranger?

397
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,880
Did he regard Mrs Dixon's shorts as a trophy to be worn with pride...

398
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,550
..and perhaps just a touch of sexual gratification?

399
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,930
Whatever the explanation, this drawing shows a killer

400
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,440
wearing an item of clothing stolen

401
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,790
from a woman he has murdered in cold blood.

402
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,250
The defendant has always maintained

403
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,730
that this drawing bears no resemblance to himself

404
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,120
as he was in the summer of 1989.

405
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,480
But due to an extraordinary quirk of fate,

406
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,360
one month before the Coastal Path murders,

407
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,790
his likeness was captured on video

408
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,510
during his appearance on a game show on national television.

409
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,830
The resulting image speaks volumes.

410
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,310
This is you.

411
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,510
Now, he can see you. But you can't see him.

412
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,750
And, er... be warned.

413
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,090
His defence barrister will be rough with you.

414
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,170
He'll try and paint you as the unreliable witness

415
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,550
with an axe to grind.

416
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,960
No worries, Steve.

417
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,410
I've got my dragon scales for protection.

418
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,240
'Let's have the jury back in, please.'

419
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,530
Both the barristers will refer to you as Adrian.

420
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,730
That's just so the jury doesn't get confused.

421
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,290
No problem.

422
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,880
'Mr Evans, are you content to begin your cross-examination...?'

423
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,070
Why did you change your name?

424
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,120
Cos he was the one that called me Adrian.

425
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,880
It was more of a girl's name back then.

426
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,960
You know that Johnny Cash song, A Boy Named Sue?

427
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,640
He played it constantly.

428
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,310
"Adrian, they're playing your song."

429
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,730
He said he called me a girl's name

430
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,750
for the same reason as the father in the song.

431
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,510
To toughen me up...

432
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,920
..cos I'd have to fight.

433
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,000
Maybe it's the one thing he got right.

434
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm a stubborn bastard.

435
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,810
Isn't it true, Adrian,

436
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,750
that when you were living at 28 Rose Meadow Lane

437
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,550
you often used to wear your father's clothes?

438
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,680
No, I never wore his clothes.

439
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,530
What about gloves, Adrian?

440
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,240
Isn't it true that you were the glove-wearer of the family?

441
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,680
I used to wear gloves. But so did he.

442
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,030
And who do you mean by "he"?

443
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,880
John Cooper.

444
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,070
Your father?

445
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,070
Yes, sir.

446
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,930
Isn't it true, Adrian, that from the age of 11

447
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,440
you started to become disobedient both at home and at school?

448
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,290
Yes, a bit, maybe.

449
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,050
Your disobedience developed into theft, did it not,

450
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,170
stealing money from your mother and father?

451
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,880
No!

452
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,400
I never stole any money from my parents. I'm not a thief.

453
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,970
A few days after the murders of Mr and Mrs Dixon,

454
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,050
a gold band was sold to a jewellers in Pembroke Dock,

455
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,680
which the prosecution claim

456
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,010
was the wedding ring the killer removed from Peter Dixon's corpse.

457
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,360
The transaction was recorded by the jeweller

458
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,240
on a receipt bearing the signature J Cooper.

459
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,210
The court has heard that your father,

460
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,640
John William Cooper, stated that the sig...

461
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,750
..jeweller's receipt was not...

462
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,530
..and that the usual form of his signature is JW Cooper.

463
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,730
Isn't it true, Adrian, that when you lived at...

464
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,090
'28 Rose Meadow Lane, you were in'

465
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,930
the habit of forging the signatures of both your mother and father

466
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,090
for the purpose of fraudulently cashing cheques in their names?

467
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,290
No, that's totally untrue.

468
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,680
You deny that you were an accomplished forger

469
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,200
of both your mother and father's signature?'

470
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,040
I can't hear what you're saying.

471
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,550
Can't hear or refuse to hear, Adrian?

472
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,930
Sorry, Mr Evans, we're having a technical issue this end.

473
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,680
Your voice keeps cutting out. One minute, please.

474
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,030
Carry on, Mr Evans. It should be OK now.

475
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,690
'I put it to you, Adrian,

476
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,920
'that for reasons known only to yourself,

477
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,680
you have long' harboured a passionate vendetta against your father.

478
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,690
'That, because of this vendetta,'

479
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,980
in your dealings with the police

480
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,730
in both the Huntsman and the Ottawa investigations,

481
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,730
you have done everything in your power

482
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,210
'to assist them in their singled-minded persecution' of your father.

483
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,370
Indeed, that you see your appearance in court today as merely

484
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,770
'another opportunity to spread more lies.'

485
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,240
Do you really think I want to be here?

486
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,640
Erin, Leanne, thank you for coming.

487
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,510
These are our parents and Erin's husband.

488
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,930
Er, we'll show you to the room you'll be giving your evidence from.

489
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,960
We've decided to give our evidence in court.

490
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,750
Karen died.

491
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,640
What happened?

492
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,840
Her health...

493
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,030
finally gave out.

494
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,270
- We're doing this for her. - Yeah.

495
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,720
- And Steven and David. - Yeah.

496
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,160
are you ok?

497
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,000
Tissues and water.

498
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,600
We often played in the woods...

499
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,510
by our estate.

500
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,480
There was a rope swing.

501
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,680
So, we were mucking about on that.

502
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,070
About...

503
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,600
eight o'clock it got dark, so we headed home.

504
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,720
We took the shortcut across the farmer's field.

505
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,480
We were about halfway along when we heard a noise.

506
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,920
We all turned round...

507
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,240
and saw someone coming towards us, shining a torch in our eyes.

508
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,790
I thought it was a boy we knew, so I shouted at him...

509
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,880
.."Shine the light in our eyes, why don't you, Martin?"

510
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,480
But the person shouted back in a man's voice...

511
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,240
.."Do I look like Martin?"

512
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,240
We all thought it was the farmer then.

513
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,360
But, erm...

514
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:36,240
as he came closer, we could see he had a mask on over his head with...

515
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,400
holes for the mouth and eyes...

516
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,840
and er, he had a shotgun pointing at us.

517
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,480
Er, David started to apologise to the man for us being on his land.

518
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,480
The man told him to shut up

519
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,240
and er, he...

520
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,550
hit him over the head with the shotgun.

521
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,150
And, erm...

522
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,130
..David started crying then.

523
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,880
And then he told us to walk down to the lower part of the field,

524
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,720
which you can't see from the estate.

525
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,250
He...

526
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,620
made us say our names.

527
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,750
His voice was angry.

528
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,360
We were all really scared.

529
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,060
And then he told us to lie down on the ground...

530
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,260
..and keep our faces in the grass.

531
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,000
And then I felt him...

532
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,790
pulling my hair at the back.

533
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,290
He told me to stand up...

534
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,630
..and to go with him.

535
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,200
Mrs Davies, the ordeal that you and your friends suffered

536
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,190
on the evening of 6th March 1996

537
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,030
happened 15 years ago.

538
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,170
You were a girl of 16.

539
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,090
Yeah.

540
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,830
You were terrified. It was dark.

541
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,110
Given all that, how reliable do you think your memory is

542
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,180
of the events which took place?

543
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,780
I remember every detail like it was yesterday.

544
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,450
You don't forget something like that.

545
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,280
You try to.

546
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,790
But you can't.

547
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,270
Did the man who attacked you ever remove his mask?

548
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,060
No.

549
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,460
So, to be clear...

550
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,760
..at no time did you, or any of your friends, see his face?

551
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,730
No.

552
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,050
This man in the photograph is the real John Cooper.

553
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,670
A loving husband who was married to his wife for 42 years.

554
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,340
We had a son who was the apple of our eye.

555
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,750
An apple that went bad and broke his mother's heart.

556
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,210
I believe that the heart attack that killed my wife

557
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,650
was brought on because of the...

558
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,800
the stress, the sadness and the shame

559
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,100
because of all the time that I spent in prison as an innocent man.

560
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,870
The police and Mr Elias tell you I'm a liar.

561
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,790
That I'm lying when I say that most of my clothes,

562
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,010
most significantly, my khaki bathers, were second-hand.

563
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,600
Well... obviously, they don't know what it's like to be poor.

564
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,750
This suit that I'm wearing today, it's second-hand.

565
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,120
In my wardrobe at home,

566
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,670
I've got an overcoat second-hand

567
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,260
that I wore to my wife's funeral.

568
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,110
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I spent ten years of my life

569
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,380
in prison for crimes that I did not commit.

570
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,090
Please... Please, do not allow the police

571
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,700
to carry out another miscarriage of justice against me.

572
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,130
I am not a murderer.

573
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,200
I am not a rapist.

574
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,290
I am an innocent man who's been wronged. Thank you.

575
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,740
Mr Elias...

576
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,920
it's a quarter to four.

577
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,830
This would probably be a suitable time for me to rise.

578
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,250
Are you content to begin your cross-examination

579
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,590
of Mr Cooper tomorrow?

580
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,970
If My Lord would permit,

581
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,690
I would like to have a few minutes with Mr Cooper.

582
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,660
- Very well, Mr Elias. - Thank you, My Lord.

583
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,650
All right, Mr Cooper...

584
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,610
I would like to ask you a few questions about

585
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,370
the balaclava which was discovered

586
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,450
under the hedgerow near the scene of the Sardis robbery.

587
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,340
Ladies and gentlemen, you will remember

588
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,830
that this is the balaclava which,

589
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,190
in the course of the Huntsman trial,

590
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,570
it was found that

591
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,600
there were a number of the defendant's head hairs within it.

592
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,180
Could you please give Mr Cooper exhibit MTJ/14, please?

593
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,920
It's all right, Mr Cooper.

594
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,100
The item has been cleared forensically.

595
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,510
Touching it won't compromise you in any way.

596
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,800
Mr Cooper...

597
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,320
is that your balaclava?

598
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,490
To the best of my knowledge.

599
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,010
Yes or no, Mr Cooper?

600
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,570
Yes. But I did not commit the Sardis robbery.

601
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,640
Like I said, that was stolen off my boat

602
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,560
long before it was found under the hedgerow.

603
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,280
But you accept that the balaclava is yours?

604
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,740
Yes.

605
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,820
Mr Cooper, that isn't what you told

606
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,440
the jury during the Huntsman trial in 1998, is it?

607
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,380
I know. I made a mistake.

608
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,840
During that trial, under oath,

609
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,230
you denied that the balaclava was yours.

610
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,140
So, my question to you, Mr Cooper,

611
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,740
is were you lying to the jury then...

612
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,990
- or are you lying to the jury now? - I'm not a liar.

613
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,280
- I forgot. I made a mistake. - Let me rephrase the question.

614
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,670
What was the truth?

615
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,400
What you told the jury in 1998

616
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,200
or what you've told the jury today?

617
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,990
No, I didn't deliberately...

618
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,250
I misremembered.

619
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,020
Misremembered in 1998 or misremembered today, Mr Cooper?

620
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,870
Mr Cooper...

621
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,520
the question is a simple one.

622
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,260
Which was it?

623
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,670
What you said to the court in 1998

624
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,790
or what you have told us today?

625
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,520
Today.

626
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,760
So, you admit that in 1998 you lied to that jury?

627
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,140
- Yes, but... - Thank you, My Lord.

628
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,220
So...

629
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,500
..members of the jury...

630
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,470
..it is now time for you to retire to consider your verdicts.

631
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,030
Remember, at all times, you must keep in mind

632
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,480
that it is for the Crown to prove

633
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,840
the guilt of John William Cooper...

634
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,650
..not for the defence to prove his innocence.

635
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,150
If the Crown have failed to do that, then you must find him...

638
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,240
not guilty.

639
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,920
- All right? - Yeah.

640
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,110
What are those?

641
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,900
That's my post-verdict statements for the press.

642
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,710
Guilty. Not guilty.

643
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,710
Well, you can get rid of that one.

645
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,170
That's my letter of resignation.

646
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,670
What?

647
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,360
I'd have failed the victims and their families.

648
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,230
Verdict.

649
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,230
All rise!

650
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,080
'Whatever the judgment is...

651
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,170
we receive it with dignity.'

652
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,090
Ella, Lynne, Glyn, Nigel, Rambo,

653
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,900
it's been an honour and a privilege.

654
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,740
- Cheers, boss. - Cheers, boss.

655
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,950
Let's have the jury in, please.

656
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,260
Will the foreman please stand?

657
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,290
Will the defendant please stand?

658
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,680
My Lord, the jury has been in retirement

659
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,750
- for eight hours and ten minutes. - Thank you.

660
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,390
Mr Foreman, please answer my next question yes or no.

661
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,540
'Have you reached a verdict on which you are all agreed?'

662
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,570
Yes.

663
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,800
Is that in relation to all 11 counts?

664
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,000
Yes.

665
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,610
On count one of the indictment, the murder of Helen Thomas,

666
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,180
do you find the defendant, John William Cooper,

667
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,520
guilty or not guilty?

668
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,380

669
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,840

Guilty.

675
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,160
On count four of the indictment,

676
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,460
the murder of Peter Dixon, guilty or not guilty?

677
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,170
Guilty.

678
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,190
On count five of the indictment,

679
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,640
the rape of Erin Davies, 'nee James...

680
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,420
'..guilty or not guilty?'

681
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,770
- Guilty. - Rubbish!

682
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,000
'That's rubbish!'

683
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,980
I'm not a child rapist!

684
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,560
This is not justice!

685
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,410
On count six of the indictment,

686
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,650

687
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,640
guilty or not guilty?

688
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,670
- 'Guilty.' - 'This is rubbish!'

689
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,760
You've not heard all the evidence!

690
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,140
This is a fit-up! This is not justice!

691
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,850
Mr Cooper, be quiet, or I will have you removed.

692
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,360
We love you, John!

693
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,750
On counts seven, eight, nine, ten and 11,

694
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,780

695
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,070
Guilty.

696
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,590
John William Cooper,

697
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,440
the jury have found you guilty of all 11 counts on the indictment.

698
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,180
Shut up, you stupid bastard!

699
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,570
I hereby sentence you to life imprisonment.

700
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,390
The crimes for which you have been convicted

701
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,360
are of such evil wickedness, the mandatory sentence of life...

702
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,060
- This is not justice! - ..will mean just that.

703
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,890
- I'm an innocent man! - Take him down.

704
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,390
This is not justice!

705
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,060
This is persecution!

706
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,240
Persecution of John Cooper, carried out by Steve Wilkins!

707
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,220
A man is gonna spend time in prison

708
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,790
for a crime he did not commit!

709
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,130
I am not a rapist! I am not a murderer!

710
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,580
This is a fit-up!

711
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,090
I am not a murderer!

712
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,080
Today's verdicts give the families of Richard and Helen Thomas,

713
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,790
Peter and Gwenda Dixon,

714
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,890
and the five victims of the Nolton Hill attack

715
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,880
and their families justice.

716
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,520
But there is no sentence the court could have imposed

717
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,570
on John William Cooper

718
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,880
that could ever compensate them for their loss.

719
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,480
Today's verdicts are a warning to all individuals

720
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,710
who would commit such terrible crimes.

721
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,680
Whatever they touch...

722
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,910
..will bear witness against them.

723
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,520
Evidence lasts.

724
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,990
It does not forget.

725
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,450
And it cannot lie.

726
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:32,070
And it will always be found by those with the will to find it.

727
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,160
Thank you.

728
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,350
On behalf of Dyfed Powys Police,

729
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,280
I would like to pay tribute to the officers of Operation Ottawa

730
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,010
for their diligence and their professionalism.

731
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,810
Are you ready for your exclusive, Mr Hill?

732
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,730
Thanks, Steve.

733
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,780
- Are we good? - Yeah.

734
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,860
Detective Superintendent,

735
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,940
can I get your reaction to today's sentencing?

736
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,210
- Yeah, really great. - Really nice.

737
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,750
- Yeah? Brilliant. - Yeah, it's amazing.

738
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,250
Great. It's all here.

739
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,810
- He loves it? - Yeah.

740
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,070
Awesome. It's all yours.

741
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,510
- Much appreciated. - Enjoy.

742
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,130
I'll look after it, I promise.

743
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,650
Thanks.

745
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,670
Boss...

746
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,220
Visitor for you downstairs.

747
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,560
Hey, what's this?

748
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,730
- I thought you were in school? - Yeah, I got the afternoon off.

749
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,790
I thought I'd come and see where it all happened.

750
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,930
Well, there's not much to see now.

751
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,250
"There is no greater responsibility or duty

752
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,150
placed on a human being than to investigate

753
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,710
"the circumstances of the death of another human being."

754
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,190
Quite the job description, eh?

755
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,960
I've decided sixth form's not for me.

756
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,140
Are you OK with that?

757
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,590
- Does your mother know? - Yeah.

758
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,420
She blames you.

759
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,000
Of course she does.

760
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,690
I'm thinking of joining the police.

761
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,460
Seriously?

762
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,070
What about the football?

763
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,610
Ah, come on, Dad.

764
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,850
I'm good, but I'm not that good.

765
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,180
What makes you think you'd be any better as a policeman?

766
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,030
You made a success of it. How hard can it be?

767
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,210
Watch it!

769
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,980
I should've stayed.

770
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,320
We should've talked.

771
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:11,980
I'm sorry, Ma.
