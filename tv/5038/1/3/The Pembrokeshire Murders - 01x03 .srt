1
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,310
辛苦啦
Anwen.

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,850
辛苦啦
- Long time. - Steve.

3
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,650
辛苦啦
We've done as you asked, removed Cooper from the scene.

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,130
辛苦啦
He is giving a statement down at Haverfordwest Station.

5
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,900
辛苦啦
The paramedics put her on the floor for CPR.

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,930
辛苦啦
We need the Home Office pathologist on this.

7
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,630
辛苦啦
I'll call the coroner.

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,920
辛苦啦
And Anwen...

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,650
辛苦啦
make sure everyone knows it's possible there's no crime here.

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,690
辛苦啦
Cooper should be treated as sensitively

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,310
辛苦啦
as any husband who's just lost his wife.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,600
辛苦啦
There's no signs of a struggle.

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,080
辛苦啦
No bruising on the arms or neck.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,730
辛苦啦
We could have prevented this.

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,830
辛苦啦
We won't know if he killed her until we get the pathologist's report.

16
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,390
辛苦啦
Till then, he won't be allowed back in the house.

17
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,290
辛苦啦
He's staying with his brother.

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,810
辛苦啦
But this is a warning.

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,910
辛苦啦
John Cooper is out, and no good can come of that.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,800
辛苦啦
And...

21
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,730
辛苦啦
we could be shut down any day.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,670
辛苦啦
So, it's not good enough for us to sit around

23
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,640
辛苦啦
waiting for forensics to save our arses.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,000
辛苦啦
We have to make something happen.

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,880
辛苦啦
Those khaki shorts are out there.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,600
辛苦啦
Morning.

27
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,040
辛苦啦
Ahead of you is 28 Rose Meadow Lane, Cooper's last home.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,920
辛苦啦
Behind you is Sardis village.

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,950
辛苦啦
This was his hunting ground.

30
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,360
辛苦啦
Those fields were his rat runs.

31
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,930
辛苦啦
And thanks to Huntsman, we know that

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,970
辛苦啦
these hedgerows were his so-called "safes",

33
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,670
辛苦啦
where he hid items he'd stolen or his offending gear.

34
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,010
辛苦啦
Now, these khaki shorts worried him in the interviews.

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,300
辛苦啦
He thinks they're out there still.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,130
辛苦啦
Steve Wilkins, hello.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,290
辛苦啦
Hello, Mr Wilkins. It's the Home Office pathologist here.

38
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,070
辛苦啦
Hello, sir.

39
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,330
辛苦啦
Thank you for getting back to me so promptly.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,890
辛苦啦
- The results of Pat Cooper's postmortem. - Yeah?

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,070
辛苦啦
She died of natural causes.

42
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,070
辛苦啦
- Natural causes? - Yes.

43
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,450
辛苦啦
- It was clearly heart failure. - Her heart?

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,800
辛苦啦
OK.

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,870
辛苦啦
All right.

46
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,090
辛苦啦
Well, thank you for getting back. We appreciate it.

47
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,110
辛苦啦
No problem.

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,520
辛苦啦
She saw this coming.

49
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,570
辛苦啦
She had an ad cut out from the paper about arranging your own funeral.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,960
辛苦啦
She knew.

51
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,580
辛苦啦
She knew living with him again would be the death of her.

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,890
辛苦啦
Do you think he'll try and make contact with you?

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,040
辛苦啦
No chance.

54
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,130
辛苦啦
What about the funeral?

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,370
辛苦啦
He won't want me there.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,080
辛苦啦
What about what you want?

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,210
辛苦啦
If you want to attend your mother's funeral, we can help with that.

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,430
辛苦啦
Too much aggro.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,580
辛苦啦
I'll go see her in my own time.

60
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,800
辛苦啦
Andrew...

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,100
辛苦啦
on behalf of my team and myself...

62
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,230
辛苦啦
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,790
辛苦啦
It wasn't your fault.

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,360
辛苦啦
Bad things happen around bad men.

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,370
辛苦啦
He's right, Steve.

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
辛苦啦
It wasn't our fault.

67
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,170
辛苦啦
If Cooper was still inside, Pat would still be alive

68
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,590
辛苦啦
and Andrew would still have a mother.

69
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,200
辛苦啦
But with Pat out of the picture, he's even more dangerous.

70
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,670
辛苦啦
It's like a ticking time bomb.

71
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,670
辛苦啦
Living on his own is new territory for him.

72
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,930
辛苦啦
Just him and his thoughts.

73
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,080
辛苦啦
His fantasies, compulsions.

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,310
辛苦啦
Ten years' worth.

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,090
辛苦啦
We have come together to commend our sister Patricia

76
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,090
辛苦啦
into the hands of Almighty God, our heavenly father.

77
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,450
辛苦啦
In the presence of death,

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,920
辛苦啦
Christians have sure grounds for hope and confidence,

79
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,070
辛苦啦
and even joy, because the Lord Jesus Christ,

80
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,230
辛苦啦
who shared our human life and death, was raised again triumphant

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,050
辛苦啦
and lives evermore. In this faith, we put our trust.

82
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,920
辛苦啦
Help us, we humbly beseech thee, Lord.

83
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,840
辛苦啦
Amen.

84
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,430
辛苦啦
Fuck!

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,190
辛苦啦
Glyn...

86
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,970
辛苦啦
Huntsman recovered all the items of clothing from the house, correct?

87
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,160
辛苦啦
Yeah, they did, yeah.

88
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,400
辛苦啦
- And they photographed every item? - Yeah.

89
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,520
辛苦啦
Khaki shorts.

90
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,070
辛苦啦
They're the same.

91
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,450
辛苦啦
There's something wrong with this picture.

92
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,850
辛苦啦
Could the colour be affected by the processing? The flash?

93
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,610
辛苦啦
Yeah, I guess so. And it's an old picture.

94
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,420
辛苦啦
We need to see what these shorts actually look like.

95
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,360
辛苦啦
Jesus Christ...

96
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,360
辛苦啦
They are khaki.

97
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,750
辛苦啦
But they do look a lot shorter.

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,920
辛苦啦
Maybe he had them altered.

99
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,450
辛苦啦
Pat was a seamstress.

100
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,670
辛苦啦
May I?

101
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,170
辛苦啦
Oh, Steve, elasticated waistband. No fly.

102
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,520
辛苦啦
They...

103
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,550
辛苦啦
They look like women's shorts.

104
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,220
辛苦啦
Yeah, well, they're all we've got.

105
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,100
辛苦啦
We're sending them in for testing.

106
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,190
辛苦啦
Steve Wilkins.

107
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,850
辛苦啦
Steve, it's Angela Gallop.

108
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,110
辛苦啦
Are you driving, by any chance?

109
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,270
辛苦啦
It's OK, you're on speaker.

110
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,380
辛苦啦
I think you'd better pull over.

111
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,070
辛苦啦
OK.

112
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,910
辛苦啦
- What is it? - Right...

113
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,370
辛苦啦
So, we unpicked the hem of the shorts, like you asked,

114
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,470
辛苦啦
and we taped the uncovered area for fibres

115
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,510
辛苦啦
and noticed there is a faint stain.

116
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,450
辛苦啦
So, we went back to the exact same spot

117
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,630
辛苦啦
on the shorts and...

118
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,070
辛苦啦
found a tiny flake of blood.

119
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,950
辛苦啦
It's Peter Dixon's.

120
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,910
辛苦啦
- How sure are you? - Full profile.

121
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,530
辛苦啦
The probability of that blood having come from anybody else

122
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,890
辛苦啦
is a billion to one.

123
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,980
辛苦啦
It's your golden nugget, Steve.

124
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,230
辛苦啦
Steve?

125
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,990
辛苦啦
Are you still there?

126
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,510
辛苦啦
Please, don't take this the wrong way...

127
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,830
辛苦啦
but I bloody love you!

128
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,830
辛苦啦
Charge him with the lot.

129
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,830
辛苦啦
Including Nolton Hill?

130
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,750
辛苦啦
- The lot. - Yes!

131
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,990
辛苦啦
Thank you.

132
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,190
辛苦啦
Thank you.

133
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,190
辛苦啦
Check the vehicle.

134
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,670
辛苦啦
We're going in.

135
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,910
辛苦啦
Morning, John.

136
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,970
辛苦啦
John William Cooper,

137
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,770
辛苦啦
you're under arrest for the murders of Helen and Richard Thomas...

138
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,550
辛苦啦
- Fuck off! Get off me! Fuck off! - And Peter and Gwenda Dixon.

139
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,690
辛苦啦
You are also under arrest

140
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,370
辛苦啦
for attempted armed robbery, rape and sexual assault

141
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,110
辛苦啦
during an attack on five teenagers in Milford Haven in 1996.

142
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,190
辛苦啦
Boss...

143
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,270
辛苦啦
Jesus...

144
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,040
辛苦啦
And I found this in the glove compartment.

145
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,190
辛苦啦
We got him just in time.

146
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,670
辛苦啦
Right, John.

147
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,690
辛苦啦
You know Detective Inspector Richards.

148
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,030
辛苦啦
I am Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins.

149
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,910
辛苦啦
I know who you are.

150
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,590
辛苦啦
Can you see OK, John?

151
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,770
辛苦啦
I've got a spare pair of glasses if you need them.

152
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,790
辛苦啦
That's me.

153
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,990
辛苦啦
That isn't.

154
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,330
辛苦啦
The last time we met, you said you'd never had collar-length hair.

155
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,370
辛苦啦
Oh, so I forgot that I had collar-length hair 20 years ago.

156
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,610
辛苦啦
It's not a crime, is it?

157
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,330
辛苦啦
Let's talk about the shorts the man in the drawing's wearing, John.

158
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,910
辛苦啦
Mr Cooper is being shown a photo of item AJM/165.

159
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,450
辛苦啦
The khaki shorts recovered by Huntsman from 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

160
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,290
辛苦啦
Now, the last time you spoke to us, John,

161
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,530
辛苦啦
you said that you'd once owned a pair of

162
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,370
辛苦啦
what you described as khaki bathers.

163
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,990
辛苦啦
Is that them?

164
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,470
辛苦啦
Well...

165
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,210
辛苦啦
if they're from my home, maybe.

166
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,170
辛苦啦
Strictly speaking, they're not bathers, John.

167
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,410
辛苦啦
The fabric's too heavy.

168
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,730
辛苦啦
I used them as bathers. So, to me, that's what they are.

169
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,890
辛苦啦
During the interview in July 2008,

170
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,650
辛苦啦
you said that the shorts worn by the man in the drawing

171
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,090
辛苦啦
couldn't possibly be yours as your bathers were much shorter.

172
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,430
辛苦啦
See for yourself.

173
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,150
辛苦啦
For the tape, I'm showing Mr Cooper item AJM/165/B.

174
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,890
辛苦啦
We unpicked the hem, John.

175
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,810
辛苦啦
So, do you see how, with the excess fabric turned down,

176
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,210
辛苦啦
the difference in length between the two pairs of shorts is reduced?

177
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,410
辛苦啦
If you do that to any garment, that's what'll happen.

178
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,050
辛苦啦
Yeah, we know your wife used to work as a seamstress.

179
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,330
辛苦啦
Did she alter these shorts?

180
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,590
辛苦啦
You leave my wife out of this.

181
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,450
辛苦啦
Since the July 2008 interviews,

182
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,370
辛苦啦
certain forensic discoveries have been made

183
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,090
辛苦啦
which we would like to discuss with you

184
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,530
辛苦啦
so that you can have an opportunity to comment.

185
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,790
辛苦啦
In reference to AJM/165/B,

186
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,130
辛苦啦
this white circle indicates an area

187
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,810
辛苦啦
where an amount of Peter Dixon's blood was found.

188
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,510
辛苦啦
Can you give us an explanation as to how that might be?

189
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,830
辛苦啦
Pat got most of my clothes from the Oxfam and Army Surplus.

190
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,250
辛苦啦
Oh, and you should also be talking to my son.

191
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,410
辛苦啦
As I told you all before, he was in the habit of borrowing my clothes.

192
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,510
辛苦啦
John...

193
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,710
辛苦啦
was Peter Dixon's blood

194
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,830
辛苦啦
deposited on the khaki shorts when you shot him?

195
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,290
辛苦啦
I've never killed anybody in my life. These shorts...

196
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,510
辛苦啦
sorry, bathers...

197
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,650
辛苦啦
were something of a treasure trove, John. Especially the pockets.

198
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,190
辛苦啦
Photo AJM/166.

199
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,490
辛苦啦
What this photo shows us, John, is a microscopic image

200
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,330
辛苦啦
of the fluff found in the pockets of your khaki bathers.

201
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,530
辛苦啦
Fluff that consisted of human hair.

202
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,270
辛苦啦
Yours. Skin cells. Also yours.

203
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,870
辛苦啦
But nothing of your son, though.

204
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,310
辛苦啦
Certain fabric fibres were also found in the fluff.

205
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,630
辛苦啦
For the tape, glove BB/109,

206
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,910
辛苦啦
found under the hedgerow near your home at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

207
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,910
辛苦啦
MTJ/5 and 7 recovered by Huntsman from the Sardis trail.

208
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,650
辛苦啦
John, are these three gloves yours?

209
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,670
辛苦啦
Absolutely not.

210
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,410
辛苦啦
As I told you before, Adrian was the glove-wearer in our family.

211
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,250
辛苦啦
I never wore gloves. I found them too cumbersome.

212
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,850
辛苦啦
What about the new pair we found in the boot of your car?

213
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,790
辛苦啦
Well...

214
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,330
辛苦啦
obviously, I wear gloves now.

215
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,290
辛苦啦
Now I'm older, I feel the cold more.

216
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,490
辛苦啦
Fibres exactly matching the constituent fibres

217
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,430
辛苦啦
of these three gloves were found in the fluff

218
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,170
辛苦啦
from the pockets of your khaki bathers.

219
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,230
辛苦啦
- How do you account for that? - Are you deaf?

220
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,460
辛苦啦
I told you, Adrian wore the bathers more than me.

221
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,890
辛苦啦
When two articles of clothing come into contact with each other,

222
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,530
辛苦啦
there is always an exchange of fibres.

223
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,670
辛苦啦
On glove BB/109,

224
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,250
辛苦啦
our team found fibres from another source.

225
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,790
辛苦啦
For the tape, BM/1,

226
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,270
辛苦啦
a sock belonging to Richard Thomas.

227
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,010
辛苦啦
The only item of clothing recovered from his body

228
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,030
辛苦啦
after it was destroyed in the fire at Scoveston Park in 1985.

229
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,270
辛苦啦
Fibres from this sock were found on glove BB/109.

230
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,510
辛苦啦
And fibres from this glove were found on this sock.

231
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,610
辛苦啦
- Are you with me so far, John? - Oh, keep talking, yeah.

232
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,570
辛苦啦
I know you want to.

233
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,050
辛苦啦
These discoveries are consistent with the accepted view

234
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,370
辛苦啦
that Richard Thomas' killer wore gloves

235
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,690
辛苦啦
when he dragged his body from the outbuilding

236
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,030
辛苦啦
into the main house at Scoveston.

237
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,930
辛苦啦
Are you listening to this, huh?

238
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,270
辛苦啦
- This is Fantasy Island. - John...

239
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,730
辛苦啦
are you the person responsible

240
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,490
辛苦啦
for the murder of Richard and Helen Thomas

241
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,840
辛苦啦
at Scoveston Park in December 1985?

242
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,830
辛苦啦
No.

243
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,230
辛苦啦
I was not.

244
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,250
辛苦啦
Fibres are the gifts that keep on giving, John.

245
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,010
辛苦啦
Other fibres, from a different source,

246
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,550
辛苦啦
were found on gloves MTJ/5 and 7.

247
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,710
辛苦啦
For the tape, BKG/9.

248
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,190
辛苦啦
Those fibres were an exact match

249
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,330
辛苦啦
with constituent fibres found in the underwear of a young female

250
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,870
辛苦啦
who was raped on the evening of the 6th March 1996

251
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,810
辛苦啦
in a field by the Nolton Hill Estate, Milford Haven.

252
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,270
辛苦啦
John, are you the person who, on 6th March 1996,

253
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,090
辛苦啦
pointed a gun at five young people,

254
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,030
辛苦啦
three females and two males, on Nolton Hill

255
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,940
辛苦啦
and searched them for money?

256
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,110
辛苦啦
Mr Cooper has not answered.

257
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,930
辛苦啦
John, are you the person who raped one of the young females?

258
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,890
辛苦啦
Mr Cooper has not answered.

259
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,930
辛苦啦
John, are you the person who indecently assaulted

260
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,070
辛苦啦
one of the other young females?

261
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,090
辛苦啦
For the tape...

262
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,910
辛苦啦
PH/2, the sawn-off shotgun found on the Sardis trail,

263
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,850
辛苦啦
which matches the description

264
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,770
辛苦啦
given by two of the victims of the Nolton Hill attack,

265
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,010
辛苦啦
and the victim in the Sardis robbery,

266
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,590
辛苦啦
a crime we know you were convicted of in 1998.

267
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,290
辛苦啦
If you're gonna say that you found my DNA

268
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,270
辛苦啦
on that, I told her...

269
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,730
辛苦啦
about the prosecution making me handle it during the trial.

270
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,270
辛苦啦
Well, we did find DNA on the gun, John.

271
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,710
辛苦啦
But not yours.

272
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,950
辛苦啦
You see the black finish on the barrel and stock?

273
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,430
辛苦啦
Anvileen satin black metal paint.

274
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,950
辛苦啦
For the tape, JAW/100,

275
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,990
辛苦啦
recovered by Huntsman from the shed at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

276
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,190
辛苦啦
John...

277
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,850
辛苦啦
were you the one who applied this paint to the barrel of the gun?

278
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,430
辛苦啦
That is not...

279
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,750
辛苦啦
my gun.

280
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,370
辛苦啦
We had the paint removed.

281
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,870
辛苦啦
On some of the flakes, our forensic scientists

282
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,300
辛苦啦
noticed a reddish cast that tested positive for blood.

283
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,990
辛苦啦
Peter Dixon's blood.

284
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,950
辛苦啦
John...

285
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,590
辛苦啦
did you shoot Peter and Gwenda Dixon with this gun?

286
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,760
辛苦啦
- What are you doing, John? - John...

287
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,150
辛苦啦
Sit down, John.

288
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,240
辛苦啦
Erin James?

289
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,530
辛苦啦
Erin Davies. I'm married.

290
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,200
辛苦啦
Hi, Erin.

291
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,620
辛苦啦
I'm Detective Inspector Ella Richards.

292
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,020
辛苦啦
This is Detective Superintendent Steve Wilkins.

293
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,570
辛苦啦
Mm, I remember you.

294
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,440
辛苦啦
Erin, we've recently arrested a man

295
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,130
辛苦啦
on suspicion of committing four murders.

296
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,660
辛苦啦
We also believe he was the man who attacked you

297
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,360
辛苦啦
and your friends in 1996.

298
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,440
辛苦啦
After all this time?

299
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,440
辛苦啦
I'm so sorry. I realise this must be a shock.

300
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,380
辛苦啦
Why couldn't you have done this 13 years ago?

301
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,440
辛苦啦
Erin...

302
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,080
辛苦啦
may I say something?

303
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,090
辛苦啦
We know we let you down.

304
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,660
辛苦啦
All we want is to see to it the man who hurt you and your friends

305
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,860
辛苦啦
never gets to hurt anyone else ever again.

306
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,150
辛苦啦
And you can help make that happen.

307
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,260
辛苦啦
All of you will be assigned Family Liaison Officers

308
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,460
辛苦啦
to support you and your family through the process.

309
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,180
辛苦啦
The trial won't be for weeks yet.

310
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
辛苦啦
I won't be taking part in any trial.

311
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,020
辛苦啦
None of you will be required to appear in court.

312
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,580
辛苦啦
Everything will be done via video link.

313
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,300
辛苦啦
You won't have to be in the same room as him.

314
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,200
辛苦啦
My husband doesn't know I was raped.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,720
辛苦啦
How was it?

316
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,400
辛苦啦
Leanne Dauncey will testify.

317
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,380
辛苦啦
Erin's angry, but Leanne thinks she can talk her round.

318
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,580
辛苦啦
Karen Joseph's out of the question. She's practically housebound.

319
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,130
辛苦啦
She's had mental health issues ever since the attack.

320
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,340
辛苦啦
The two boys won't cooperate, either.

321
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,540
辛苦啦
Not after everything that happened with the original investigation.

322
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,420
辛苦啦
The trial begins at Swansea Crown Court tomorrow

323
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,960
辛苦啦
of 65-year-old John William Cooper of Letterston, Pembrokeshire.

324
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,740
辛苦啦
Cooper has been charged with the four murders

325
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,700
辛苦啦
and with the rape and indecent assault

326
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,920
辛苦啦
of two teenage girls at Milford Haven in 1996.

327
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,860
辛苦啦
The defence will make much of the fact that the khaki shorts

328
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,000
辛苦啦
are indeed women's shorts.

329
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,340
辛苦啦
That it makes no sense that the defendant was wearing them

330
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,170
辛苦啦
when he brutally murdered Mr and Mrs Dixon.

331
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,610
辛苦啦
But murder cases have a habit of defying common sense.

332
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,450
辛苦啦
According to the son of Mr and Mrs Dixon...

333
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,620
辛苦啦
whenever his parents went walking and his mother was wearing

334
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,700
辛苦啦
long trousers, she would always put a pair of shorts

335
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,650
辛苦啦
in her backpack in case the weather turned warm.

336
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,480
辛苦啦
But no shorts of any description were found

337
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,660
辛苦啦
at the Coastal Path crime scene.

338
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,000
辛苦啦
Why?

339
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,740
辛苦啦
Imagine the sequence of events, ladies and gentlemen.

340
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,050
辛苦啦
The defendant shoots the Dixons at close range.

341
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,810
辛苦啦
He then moves their bodies and covers them with branches.

342
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,850
辛苦啦
In the process, some of their blood -

343
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,940
辛苦啦
judging by these distressing images, probably a lot of their blood -

344
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,680
辛苦啦
gets onto his trousers.

345
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,160
辛苦啦
In a panic, he goes through his victims' backpacks and finds...

346
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,480
辛苦啦
Mrs Dixon's khaki shorts.

347
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,740
辛苦啦
He removes his own blood-stained trousers

348
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,680
辛苦啦
and puts on Mrs Dixon's shorts and quits the scene,

349
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,330
辛苦啦
taking his trousers with him, unaware that a single spot

350
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,400
辛苦啦
of Peter Dixon's blood had found its way onto the shorts.

351
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,850
辛苦啦
How come you're not inside?

352
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,200
辛苦啦
The SIO is the last Crown witness.

353
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,820
辛苦啦
I'm not allowed in until I give my evidence.

354
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,450
辛苦啦
How are you feeling?

355
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,480
辛苦啦
Ready as I'll ever be.

356
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,130
辛苦啦
Come on.

357
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,650
辛苦啦
This police artist's impression was based on

358
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,100
辛苦啦
a witness sighting of the defendant as he withdrew cash

359
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,400
辛苦啦
from a NatWest ATM in Haverfordwest using Peter Dixon's bank card.

360
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,330
辛苦啦
The sighting was made two days after the murder and yet, incredibly,

361
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,240
辛苦啦
the defendant was still wearing Mrs Dixon's khaki shorts.

362
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:47,160
辛苦啦
A hugely incriminating piece of evidence linking him to two murders.

363
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,200
辛苦啦
Why on earth had he not disposed of them at the earliest opportunity?

364
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
辛苦啦
Think about what that says about the mind of John William Cooper.

365
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,050
辛苦啦
Was he thumbing his nose at the world,

366
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:04,090
辛苦啦
convinced that he was too clever to be caught for his horrific crime?

367
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,370
辛苦啦
Or was his motivation darker, stranger?

368
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,960
辛苦啦
Did he regard Mrs Dixon's shorts as a trophy to be worn with pride...

369
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,760
辛苦啦
and perhaps just a touch of sexual gratification?

370
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,530
辛苦啦
Whatever the explanation, this drawing shows a killer

371
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,610
辛苦啦
wearing an item of clothing stolen from a woman

372
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,960
辛苦啦
he has murdered in cold blood.

373
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,890
辛苦啦
The defendant has always maintained

374
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,340
辛苦啦
that this drawing bears no resemblance to himself

375
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,850
辛苦啦
as he was in the summer of 1989.

376
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,920
辛苦啦
But due to an extraordinary quirk of fate,

377
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,540
辛苦啦
one month before the Coastal Path murders,

378
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,290
辛苦啦
his likeness was captured on video

379
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,100
辛苦啦
during his appearance on a game show on national television.

380
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,300
辛苦啦
The resulting image speaks volumes.

381
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,400
辛苦啦
This is you.

382
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,240
辛苦啦
Now, he can see you. But you can't see him.

383
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,760
辛苦啦
And, er... be warned.

384
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,460
辛苦啦
His defence barrister will be rough with you.

385
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,820
辛苦啦
He'll try and paint you as the unreliable witness

386
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,220
辛苦啦
with an axe to grind.

387
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,000
辛苦啦
No worries, Steve.

388
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,780
辛苦啦
I've got my dragon scales for protection.

389
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,610
辛苦啦
Let's have the jury back in, please.

390
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,580
辛苦啦
Both the barristers will refer to you as Adrian.

391
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,940
辛苦啦
That's just so the jury doesn't get confused.

392
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,200
辛苦啦
No problem.

393
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,500
辛苦啦
Mr Evans, are you content to begin your cross-examination...?

394
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,460
辛苦啦
Why did you change your name?

395
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,350
辛苦啦
Cos he was the one that called me Adrian.

396
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,020
辛苦啦
It was more of a girl's name back then.

397
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,480
辛苦啦
You know that Johnny Cash song, A Boy Named Sue?

398
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,330
辛苦啦
He played it constantly.

399
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,290
辛苦啦
"Adrian, they're playing your song."

400
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,380
辛苦啦
He said he called me a girl's name

401
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,310
辛苦啦
for the same reason as the father in the song.

402
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,440
辛苦啦
To toughen me up...

403
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,920
辛苦啦
cos I'd have to fight.

404
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,310
辛苦啦
Maybe it's the one thing he got right.

405
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,330
辛苦啦
I'm a stubborn bastard.

406
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,540
辛苦啦
Isn't it true, Adrian,

407
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,440
辛苦啦
that when you were living at 28 Rose Meadow Lane

408
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,140
辛苦啦
you often used to wear your father's clothes?

409
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,290
辛苦啦
No, I never wore his clothes.

410
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,440
辛苦啦
What about gloves, Adrian?

411
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,900
辛苦啦
Isn't it true that you were the glove-wearer of the family?

412
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,850
辛苦啦
I used to wear gloves. But so did he.

413
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,130
辛苦啦
And who do you mean by "he"?

414
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,330
辛苦啦
John Cooper.

415
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,330
辛苦啦
Your father?

416
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,400
辛苦啦
Yes, sir.

417
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,650
辛苦啦
Isn't it true, Adrian, that from the age of 11

418
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,340
辛苦啦
you started to become disobedient both at home and at school?

419
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,000
辛苦啦
Yes, a bit, maybe.

420
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,380
辛苦啦
Your disobedience developed into theft, did it not,

421
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,260
辛苦啦
stealing money from your mother and father?

422
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,330
辛苦啦
No!

423
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,660
辛苦啦
I never stole any money from my parents.

424
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,200
辛苦啦
I'm not a thief.

425
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,740
辛苦啦
A few days after the murders of Mr and Mrs Dixon,

426
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,240
辛苦啦
a gold band was sold to a jewellers in Pembroke Dock,

427
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,920
辛苦啦
which the prosecution claim

428
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,020
辛苦啦
was the wedding ring the killer removed from Peter Dixon's corpse.

429
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,260
辛苦啦
The transaction was recorded by the jeweller on a receipt

430
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,720
辛苦啦
bearing the signature J Cooper.

431
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,500
辛苦啦
The court has heard that your father,

432
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,920
辛苦啦
John William Cooper, stated that the sig...

433
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,680
辛苦啦
jeweller's receipt was not...

434
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,650
辛苦啦
and that the usual form of his signature is JW Cooper.

435
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,180
辛苦啦
Isn't it true, Adrian, that when you lived at...

436
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,900
辛苦啦
28 Rose Meadow Lane, you were in

437
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,620
辛苦啦
the habit of forging the signatures of both your mother and father

438
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,580
辛苦啦
for the purpose of fraudulently cashing cheques in their names?

439
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,820
辛苦啦
No, that's totally untrue.

440
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,740
辛苦啦
You deny that you were an accomplished forger

441
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,300
辛苦啦
of both your mother...

442
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,300
辛苦啦
and father's signature?

443
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,980
辛苦啦
- I can't hear what you're saying. - Can't hear...

444
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,130
辛苦啦
or refuse to hear, Adrian?

445
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,700
辛苦啦
Sorry, Mr Evans, we're having a technical issue this end.

446
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,800
辛苦啦
Your voice keeps cutting out. One minute, please.

447
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,600
辛苦啦
Carry on, Mr Evans. It should be OK now.

448
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,330
辛苦啦
I put it to you, Adrian,

449
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,700
辛苦啦
that for reasons known only to yourself, you have long

450
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,780
辛苦啦
harboured a passionate vendetta against your father.

451
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,740
辛苦啦
That, because of this vendetta,

452
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,780
辛苦啦
in your dealings with the police in both

453
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,220
辛苦啦
the Huntsman and the Ottawa investigations,

454
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,000
辛苦啦
you have done everything in your power

455
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,700
辛苦啦
to assist them in their singled-minded persecution

456
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,160
辛苦啦
of your father.

457
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,860
辛苦啦
Indeed, that you see your appearance in court today as merely

458
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,220
辛苦啦
another opportunity to spread more lies.

459
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,710
辛苦啦
Do you really think I want to be here?

460
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,950
辛苦啦
Erin, Leanne, thank you for coming.

461
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,240
辛苦啦
These are our parents and Erin's husband.

462
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,300
辛苦啦
Er, we'll show you to the room you'll be giving your evidence from.

463
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,530
辛苦啦
We've decided to give our evidence in court.

464
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,330
辛苦啦
Karen died.

465
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,000
辛苦啦
What happened?

466
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,650
辛苦啦
Her health...

467
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,680
辛苦啦
finally gave out.

468
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,160
辛苦啦
- We're doing this for her. - Yeah.

469
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,270
辛苦啦
- And Stephen and David. - Yeah.

470
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,500
辛苦啦
Are you OK?

471
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,000
辛苦啦
Tissues and water.

472
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,240
辛苦啦
We often played in the woods...

473
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,720
辛苦啦
by our estate.

474
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,240
辛苦啦
There was a rope swing.

475
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,550
辛苦啦
So, we were mucking about on that.

476
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
辛苦啦
About...

477
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
辛苦啦
eight o'clock it got dark, so we headed home.

478
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,990
辛苦啦
We took the shortcut across the farmer's field.

479
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,920
辛苦啦
We were about halfway along when we heard a noise.

480
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,920
辛苦啦
We all turned round...

481
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,930
辛苦啦
and saw someone coming towards us, shining a torch in our eyes.

482
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,240
辛苦啦
I thought it was a boy we knew, so I shouted at him...

483
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,410
辛苦啦
"Shine the light in our eyes, why don't you, Martin?"

484
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,610
辛苦啦
But the person shouted back in a man's voice...

485
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,290
辛苦啦
"Do I look like Martin?"

486
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,110
辛苦啦
We all thought it was the farmer then.

487
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,090
辛苦啦
But, erm...

488
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:17,440
辛苦啦
as he came closer, we could see he had a mask on over his head with...

489
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,290
辛苦啦
holes for the mouth and eyes...

490
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,890
辛苦啦
and er, he had a shotgun pointing at us.

491
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:31,610
辛苦啦
Er, David started to apologise to the man for us being on his land.

492
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,090
辛苦啦
The man told him to shut up

493
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,760
辛苦啦
and er, he...

494
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,340
辛苦啦
hit him over the head with the shotgun.

495
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,400
辛苦啦
And, erm...

496
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,530
辛苦啦
David started crying then.

497
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,130
辛苦啦
And then he told us to walk down to the lower part of the field,

498
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,680
辛苦啦
which you can't see from the estate.

499
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,810
辛苦啦
He...

500
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,960
辛苦啦
made us say our names.

501
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
辛苦啦
His voice was angry.

502
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,780
辛苦啦
We were all really scared.

503
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,730
辛苦啦
And then he told us to lie down on the ground...

504
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,700
辛苦啦
and keep our faces in the grass.

505
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
辛苦啦
And then I felt him...

506
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,160
辛苦啦
pulling my hair at the back.

507
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,530
辛苦啦
He told me to stand up...

508
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,120
辛苦啦
and to go with him.

509
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,580
辛苦啦
Mrs Davies, the ordeal that you and your friends suffered

510
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,920
辛苦啦
on the evening of 6th March 1996

511
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
辛苦啦
happened 15 years ago.

512
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,440
辛苦啦
You were a girl of 16.

513
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,650
辛苦啦
Yeah.

514
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,370
辛苦啦
You were terrified. It was dark.

515
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,420
辛苦啦
Given all that,

516
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,620
辛苦啦
how reliable do you think your memory is

517
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,710
辛苦啦
of the events which took place?

518
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,760
辛苦啦
I remember every detail like it was yesterday.

519
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,730
辛苦啦
You don't forget something like that.

520
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,530
辛苦啦
You try to.

521
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,650
辛苦啦
But you can't.

522
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,160
辛苦啦
Did the man who attacked you ever remove his mask?

523
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
辛苦啦
No.

524
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,400
辛苦啦
So, to be clear...

525
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,200
辛苦啦
at no time did you, or any of your friends, see his face?

526
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,330
辛苦啦
No.

527
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,020
辛苦啦
This man in the photograph is the real John Cooper.

528
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,690
辛苦啦
A loving husband who was married to his wife for 42 years.

529
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,410
辛苦啦
We had a son who was the apple of our eye.

530
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,470
辛苦啦
An apple that went bad and broke his mother's heart.

531
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,490
辛苦啦
I believe that the heart attack that killed my wife

532
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,660
辛苦啦
was brought on because of the...

533
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,530
辛苦啦
the stress, the sadness and the shame

534
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,720
辛苦啦
because of all the time that I spent in prison as an innocent man.

535
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,640
辛苦啦
The police and Mr Elias tell you I'm a liar.

536
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,330
辛苦啦
That I'm lying when I say that most of my clothes,

537
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,300
辛苦啦
most significantly, my khaki bathers, were second-hand.

538
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,530
辛苦啦
Well...

539
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,980
辛苦啦
obviously, they don't know what it's like to be poor.

540
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,820
辛苦啦
This suit that I'm wearing today, it's second-hand.

541
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,340
辛苦啦
In my wardrobe at home,

542
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,530
辛苦啦
I've got an overcoat second-hand that I wore to my wife's funeral.

543
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,420
辛苦啦
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I spent ten years of my life

544
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,740
辛苦啦
in prison for crimes that I did not commit.

545
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,010
辛苦啦
Please... Please, do not allow

546
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,370
辛苦啦
the police to carry out another miscarriage of justice against me.

547
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,280
辛苦啦
I am not a murderer.

548
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,450
辛苦啦
I am not a rapist.

549
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,410
辛苦啦
I am an innocent man who's been wronged.

550
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,810
辛苦啦
Thank you.

551
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,490
辛苦啦
Mr Elias...

552
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,060
辛苦啦
it's a quarter to four.

553
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,020
辛苦啦
This would probably be a suitable time for me to rise.

554
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,300
辛苦啦
Are you content to begin your cross-examination

555
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,820
辛苦啦
of Mr Cooper tomorrow?

556
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,260
辛苦啦
If My Lord would permit,

557
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,700
辛苦啦
I would like to have a few minutes with Mr Cooper.

558
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,890
辛苦啦
- Very well, Mr Elias. - Thank you, My Lord.

559
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,930
辛苦啦
All right, Mr Cooper...

560
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,260
辛苦啦
I would like to ask you a few questions about

561
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,060
辛苦啦
the balaclava which was discovered

562
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,660
辛苦啦
under the hedgerow near the scene of the Sardis robbery.

563
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,490
辛苦啦
Ladies and gentlemen, you will remember

564
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:37,370
辛苦啦
that this is the balaclava which, in the course of the Huntsman trial,

565
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,770
辛苦啦
it was found that

566
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,580
辛苦啦
there were a number of the defendant's head hairs within it.

567
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,970
辛苦啦
Could you please give Mr Cooper exhibit MTJ/14, please?

568
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,280
辛苦啦
It's all right, Mr Cooper.

569
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,220
辛苦啦
The item has been cleared forensically.

570
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,110
辛苦啦
Touching it won't compromise you in any way.

571
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,410
辛苦啦
Mr Cooper...

572
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,130
辛苦啦
is that your balaclava?

573
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,740
辛苦啦
To the best of my knowledge.

574
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,440
辛苦啦
Yes or no, Mr Cooper?

575
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,760
辛苦啦
Yes. But I did not commit the Sardis robbery.

576
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,980
辛苦啦
Like I said, that was stolen off my boat

577
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,740
辛苦啦
long before it was found under the hedgerow.

578
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,560
辛苦啦
But you accept that the balaclava is yours?

579
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,200
辛苦啦
Yes.

580
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,080
辛苦啦
Mr Cooper, that isn't what you told the jury during the Huntsman trial

581
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,640
辛苦啦
in 1998, is it?

582
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,410
辛苦啦
I know. I made a mistake.

583
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,890
辛苦啦
During that trial, under oath, you denied that the balaclava was yours.

584
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,160
辛苦啦
So, my question to you, Mr Cooper,

585
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,370
辛苦啦
is were you lying to the jury then...

586
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,730
辛苦啦
- or are you lying to the jury now? - I'm not a liar.

587
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,540
辛苦啦
- I forgot. I made a mistake. - Let me rephrase the question.

588
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,820
辛苦啦
What was the truth?

589
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,700
辛苦啦
What you told the jury in 1998 or what you've told the jury today?

590
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,080
辛苦啦
No, I didn't deliberately...

591
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,220
辛苦啦
I misremembered.

592
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,450
辛苦啦
Misremembered in 1998 or misremembered today, Mr Cooper?

593
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,530
辛苦啦
Mr Cooper...

594
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,100
辛苦啦
the question is a simple one.

595
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,330
辛苦啦
Which was it?

596
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,890
辛苦啦
What you said to the court in 1998 or what you have told us today?

597
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,160
辛苦啦
Today.

598
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,120
辛苦啦
So, you admit that in 1998 you lied to that jury?

599
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,430
辛苦啦
- Yes, but... - Thank you, My Lord.

600
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,490
辛苦啦
So...

601
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,170
辛苦啦
members of the jury...

602
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,910
辛苦啦
it is now time for you to retire to consider your verdicts.

603
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,200
辛苦啦
Remember, at all times, you must keep in mind

604
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,540
辛苦啦
that it is for the Crown to prove the guilt of John William Cooper...

605
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,240
辛苦啦
not for the defence to prove his innocence.

606
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,010
辛苦啦
If the Crown have failed to do that, then you must find him...

607
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,560
辛苦啦
not guilty.

608
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,120
辛苦啦
- All right? - Yeah.

609
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,600
辛苦啦
What are those?

610
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,820
辛苦啦
That's my post-verdict statements for the press.

611
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,640
辛苦啦
Guilty. Not guilty.

612
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,240
辛苦啦
Well, you can get rid of that one.

613
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,450
辛苦啦
That's my letter of resignation.

614
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,050
辛苦啦
What?

615
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,030
辛苦啦
I'd have failed the victims and their families.

616
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,970
辛苦啦
Verdict.

617

00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,490
辛苦啦
we receive it with dignity.

620
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,370
辛苦啦
Ella, Lynne, Glyn, Nigel, Rambo, it's been an honour

621
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,120
辛苦啦
and a privilege.

622
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,450
辛苦啦
- Cheers, boss. - Cheers, boss.

623
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,950
辛苦啦
Let's have the jury in, please.

624
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,370
辛苦啦
Will the foreman please stand?

625
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,450
辛苦啦
Will the defendant please stand?

626
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,860

00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,050
辛苦啦
I'm good, but I'm not that good.

730
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,940
辛苦啦
What makes you think you'd be any better as a policeman?

731
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,780
辛苦啦
You made a success of it. How hard can it be?

732
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,760
辛苦啦
Watch it!

733
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,810
辛苦啦
I should've stayed.

734
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,160
辛苦啦
We should've talked.

735
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,530
辛苦啦
I'm sorry, Ma.
