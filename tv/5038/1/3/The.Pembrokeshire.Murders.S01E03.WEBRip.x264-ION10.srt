1
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,065
Anwen.

2
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,123
- Long time.
- Steve.

3
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:59,923
We've done as you asked,
removed Cooper from the scene.

4
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:03,380
He is giving a statement
down at Haverfordwest Station.

5
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:13,151
The paramedics put her
on the floor for CPR.

6
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,203
We need the Home Office pathologist
on this.

7
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,884
I'll call the coroner.

8
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,165
And Anwen...

9
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:22,923
make sure everyone knows
it's possible there's no crime here.

10
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:24,963
Cooper should be treated
as sensitively

11
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:27,564
as any husband
who's just lost his wife.

12
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,845
There's no signs
of a struggle.

13
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,325
No bruising on the arms or neck.

14
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,978
We could have prevented this.

15
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:54,077
We won't know if he killed her until
we get the pathologist's report.

16
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:57,644
Till then, he won't be allowed
back in the house.

17
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:59,564
He's staying with his brother.

18
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:01,083
But this is a warning.

19
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:04,156
John Cooper is out,
and no good can come of that.

20
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,045
And...

21
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:09,004
we could be shut down any day.

22
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,924
So, it's not good enough
for us to sit around

23
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:14,885
waiting for forensics
to save our arses.

24
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:18,245
We have to make something happen.

25
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,125
Those khaki shorts are out there.

26
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,845
Morning.

27
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:37,285
Ahead of you is 28 Rose Meadow Lane,
Cooper's last home.

28
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:41,165
Behind you is Sardis village.

29
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:43,204
This was his hunting ground.

30
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,605
Those fields were his rat runs.

31
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:47,203
And thanks to Huntsman, we know that

32
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:49,243
these hedgerows
were his so-called "safes",

33
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:52,924
where he hid items he'd stolen
or his offending gear.

34
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:56,284
Now, these khaki shorts
worried him in the interviews.

35
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,552
He thinks they're out there still.

36
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,404
Steve Wilkins, hello.

37
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:24,563
<i>Hello, Mr Wilkins. It's
the Home Office pathologist here.</i>

38
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,324
Hello, sir.

39
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:28,604
Thank you for getting back to me
so promptly.

40
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:31,164
- <i>The results of Pat Cooper's postmortem.</i>
- Yeah?

41
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:33,324
<i>She died of natural causes.</i>

42
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:35,324
- Natural causes?
- <i>Yes.</i>

43
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:37,724
- <i>It was clearly heart failure.</i>
- Her heart?

44
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,045
OK.

45
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:40,124
All right.

46
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:42,363
Well, thank you for getting back.
We appreciate it.

47
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:43,364
<i>No problem.</i>

48
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:48,765
She saw this coming.

49
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:54,844
She had an ad cut out from the paper
about arranging your own funeral.

50
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,205
She knew.

51
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:59,828
She knew living with him again
would be the death of her.

52
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,164
Do you think
he'll try and make contact with you?

53
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:04,285
No chance.

54
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:05,404
What about the funeral?

55
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,644
He won't want me there.

56
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:08,325
What about what you want?

57
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:13,483
If you want to attend your mother's
funeral, we can help with that.

58
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:14,684
Too much aggro.

59
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,832
I'll go see her in my own time.

60
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,045
Andrew...

61
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,352
on behalf of my team and myself...

62
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:24,484
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:29,044
It wasn't your fault.

64
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:32,605
Bad things happen around bad men.

65
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:39,644
He's right, Steve.

66
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:41,645
It wasn't our fault.

67
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:44,443
If Cooper was still inside,
Pat would still be alive

68
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,844
and Andrew
would still have a mother.

69
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:56,452
But with Pat out of the picture,
he's even more dangerous.

70
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,924
It's like a ticking time bomb.

71
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:02,924
Living on his own
is new territory for him.

72
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:09,177
Just him and his thoughts.

73
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,325
His fantasies, compulsions.

74
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,564
Ten years' worth.

75
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:27,363
We have come together
to commend our sister Patricia

76
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:30,363
into the hands of Almighty God,
our heavenly father.

77
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:31,724
In the presence of death,

78
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,165
Christians have sure grounds
for hope and confidence,

79
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:38,324
and even joy,
because the Lord Jesus Christ,

80
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:43,484
who shared our human life and death,
was raised again triumphant

81
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:46,323
and lives evermore.
In this faith, we put our trust.

82
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,165
Help us, we humbly beseech thee,
Lord.

83
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:53,085
Amen.

84
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:36,684
Fuck!

85
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:39,444
Glyn...

86
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:43,243
Huntsman recovered all the items
of clothing from the house, correct?

87
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,405
Yeah, they did, yeah.

88
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:48,645
- And they photographed every item?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:51,765
Khaki shorts.

90
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,324
They're the same.

91
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:55,724
There's something wrong
with this picture.

92
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,123
Could the colour be affected
by the processing? The flash?

93
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:01,857
Yeah, I guess so.
And it's an old picture.

94
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,669
We need to see what these shorts
actually look like.

95
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:32,605
Jesus Christ...

96
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,605
They are khaki.

97
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,004
But they do look a lot shorter.

98
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:40,165
Maybe he had them altered.

99
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:41,723
Pat was a seamstress.

100
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:42,924
May I?

101
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:49,443
Oh, Steve, elasticated waistband.
No fly.

102
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:50,765
They...

103
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:52,804
They look like women's shorts.

104
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,471
Yeah, well, they're all we've got.

105
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:02,351
We're sending them in for testing.

106
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:23,406
Steve Wilkins.

107
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,086
<i>Steve, it's Angela Gallop.</i>

108
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,327
<i>Are you driving, by any chance?</i>

109
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,487
It's OK, you're on speaker.

110
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,593
<i>I think you'd better pull over.</i>

111
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:42,286
OK.

112
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,126
- What is it?
- <i>Right...</i>

113
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,606
So, we unpicked the hem
of the shorts, like you asked,

114
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:49,687
and we taped the uncovered area
for fibres

115
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:52,727
<i>and noticed there is a faint stain.</i>

116
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,686
<i>So, we went back
to the exact same spot</i>

117
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,847
on the shorts and...

118
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:59,286
...found a tiny flake of blood.

119
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:03,166
It's Peter Dixon's.

120
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:09,126
- How sure are you?
- <i>Full profile.</i>

121
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,765
The probability of that blood
having come from anybody else

122
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,125
<i>is a billion to one.</i>

123
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:16,193
<i>It's your golden nugget, Steve.</i>

124
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,447
Steve?

125
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,207
<i>Are you still there?</i>

126
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,726
Please, don't take this
the wrong way...

127
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:33,046
...but I bloody love you!

128
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,046
Charge him with the lot.

129
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,046
Including Nolton Hill?

130
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:05,967
- The lot.
- Yes!

131
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:10,207
Thank you.

132
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,406
Thank you.

133
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,407
Check the vehicle.

134
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,886
We're going in.

135
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,126
Morning, John.

136
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,206
John William Cooper,

137
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:41,005
you're under arrest for the murders
of Helen and Richard Thomas...

138
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:43,790
- Fuck off! Get off me! Fuck off!
- ...and Peter and Gwenda Dixon.

139
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,926
You are also under arrest

140
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,606
for attempted armed robbery,
rape and sexual assault

141
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:52,327
during an attack on five teenagers
in Milford Haven in 1996.

142
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,406
Boss...

143
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,487
Jesus...

144
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:03,260
And I found this
in the glove compartment.

145
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,406
We got him just in time.

146
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,886
Right, John.

147
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:18,926
You know
Detective Inspector Richards.

148
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:22,246
I am Detective Superintendent
Steve Wilkins.

149
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:24,126
I know who you are.

150
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,807
Can you see OK, John?

151
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,983
I've got a spare pair of glasses
if you need them.

152
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,006
That's me.

153
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,207
That isn't.

154
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:41,566
The last time we met, you said
you'd never had collar-length hair.

155
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,606
Oh, so I forgot that I had
collar-length hair 20 years ago.

156
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:45,846
It's not a crime, is it?

157
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:49,566
Let's talk about the shorts the man
in the drawing's wearing, John.

158
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:55,126
Mr Cooper is being shown
a photo of item AJM/165.

159
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,686
The khaki shorts recovered by
Huntsman from 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

160
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:00,525
Now, the last time you spoke to us,
John,

161
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,765
you said that
you'd once owned a pair of

162
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,606
what you described as khaki bathers.

163
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,207
Is that them?

164
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:07,687
Well...

165
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:09,446
if they're from my home, maybe.

166
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:11,405
Strictly speaking,
they're not bathers, John.

167
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:12,645
The fabric's too heavy.

168
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:14,966
I used them as bathers.
So, to me, that's what they are.

169
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,125
During the interview in July 2008,

170
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,885
you said that the shorts
worn by the man in the drawing

171
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:23,326
couldn't possibly be yours
as your bathers were much shorter.

172
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,646
See for yourself.

173
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:30,366
For the tape, I'm showing Mr Cooper
item AJM/165/B.

174
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:32,125
We unpicked the hem, John.

175
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:35,045
So, do you see how,
with the excess fabric turned down,

176
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,446
the difference in length between
the two pairs of shorts is reduced?

177
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,645
If you do that to any garment,
that's what'll happen.

178
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:43,285
Yeah, we know your wife
used to work as a seamstress.

179
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:44,566
Did she alter these shorts?

180
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,807
You leave my wife out of this.

181
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,686
Since the July 2008 interviews,

182
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,606
certain forensic discoveries
have been made

183
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,326
which we would like to discuss
with you

184
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,765
so that you can have an opportunity
to comment.

185
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:58,006
In reference to AJM/165/B,

186
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,365
this white circle indicates an area

187
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:03,045
where an amount of Peter Dixon's
blood was found.

188
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:06,727
Can you give us an explanation
as to how that might be?

189
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:19,046
Pat got most of my clothes
from the Oxfam and Army Surplus.

190
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,486
Oh, and you should also
be talking to my son.

191
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,645
As I told you all before, he was in
the habit of borrowing my clothes.

192
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:27,727
John...

193
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,927
was Peter Dixon's blood

194
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:33,046
deposited on the khaki shorts
when you shot him?

195
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,525
I've never killed anybody
in my life. These shorts...

196
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,727
sorry, bathers...

197
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:42,862
were something of a treasure trove,
John. Especially the pockets.

198
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:46,406
Photo AJM/166.

199
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:49,726
What this photo shows us, John,
is a microscopic image

200
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,566
of the fluff found in the pockets
of your khaki bathers.

201
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,765
Fluff that consisted of human hair.

202
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:57,487
Yours. Skin cells. Also yours.

203
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:00,087
But nothing of your son, though.

204
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:04,526
Certain fabric fibres
were also found in the fluff.

205
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,847
For the tape, glove BB/109,

206
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:12,126
found under the hedgerow near
your home at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

207
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:17,126
MTJ/5 and 7 recovered by Huntsman
from the Sardis trail.

208
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,885
John, are these three gloves yours?

209
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,886
Absolutely not.

210
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:25,645
As I told you before, Adrian
was the glove-wearer in our family.

211
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:28,486
I never wore gloves.
I found them too cumbersome.

212
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:32,071
What about the new pair
we found in the boot of your car?

213
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,006
Well...

214
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,566
obviously, I wear gloves now.

215
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,525
Now I'm older, I feel the cold more.

216
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,726
Fibres exactly matching
the constituent fibres

217
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:42,646
of these three gloves
were found in the fluff

218
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:44,405
from the pockets
of your khaki bathers.

219
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:47,447
- How do you account for that?
- Are you deaf?

220
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,679
I told you, Adrian wore the bathers
more than me.

221
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:58,125
When two articles of clothing
come into contact with each other,

222
00:15:58,126 --> 00:15:59,765
there is always
an exchange of fibres.

223
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,886
On glove BB/109,

224
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,486
our team found fibres
from another source.

225
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,006
For the tape, BM/1,

226
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,487
a sock belonging to Richard Thomas.

227
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:12,245
The only item of clothing
recovered from his body

228
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:16,246
after it was destroyed in the fire
at Scoveston Park in 1985.

229
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:20,487
Fibres from this sock
were found on glove BB/109.

230
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,726
And fibres from this glove
were found on this sock.

231
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,847
- Are you with me so far, John?
- Oh, keep talking, yeah.

232
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:27,806
I know you want to.

233
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:30,285
These discoveries are consistent
with the accepted view

234
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:32,606
that Richard Thomas' killer
wore gloves

235
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:34,926
when he dragged his body
from the outbuilding

236
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,246
into the main house at Scoveston.

237
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,165
Are you listening to this, huh?

238
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,487
- This is Fantasy Island.
- John...

239
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,966
are you the person responsible

240
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,726
for the murder
of Richard and Helen Thomas

241
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,061
at Scoveston Park in December 1985?

242
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:50,046
No.

243
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,447
I was not.

244
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,486
Fibres are the gifts
that keep on giving, John.

245
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,245
Other fibres,
from a different source,

246
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:57,766
were found on gloves MTJ/5 and 7.

247
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,927
For the tape, BKG/9.

248
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,406
Those fibres were an exact match

249
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:07,566
with constituent fibres found
in the underwear of a young female

250
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:12,086
who was raped
on the evening of the 6th March 1996

251
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:15,045
in a field by the Nolton Hill
Estate, Milford Haven.

252
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:18,487
John, are you the person who,
on 6th March 1996,

253
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:20,325
pointed a gun at five young people,

254
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:23,246
three females and two males,
on Nolton Hill

255
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:25,153
and searched them for money?

256
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:28,326
Mr Cooper has not answered.

257
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:32,143
John, are you the person
who raped one of the young females?

258
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,126
Mr Cooper has not answered.

259
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,166
John, are you the person
who indecently assaulted

260
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,286
one of the other young females?

261
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,325
For the tape...

262
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:54,127
PH/2, the sawn-off shotgun
found on the Sardis trail,

263
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,085
which matches the description

264
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:59,005
given by two of the victims
of the Nolton Hill attack,

265
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,245
and the victim
in the Sardis robbery,

266
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,806
a crime we know
you were convicted of in 1998.

267
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:06,525
If you're gonna say
that you found my DNA

268
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:08,487
on that, I told her...

269
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,966
about the prosecution making me
handle it during the trial.

270
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:14,487
Well, we did find DNA on the gun,
John.

271
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,927
But not yours.

272
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:19,167
You see the black finish
on the barrel and stock?

273
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,647
Anvileen satin black metal paint.

274
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:27,167
For the tape, JAW/100,

275
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:31,207
recovered by Huntsman from the shed
at 28 Rose Meadow Lane.

276
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:33,407
John...

277
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,085
were you the one who applied
this paint to the barrel of the gun?

278
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,647
That is not...

279
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:41,967
my gun.

280
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:43,605
We had the paint removed.

281
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:47,086
On some of the flakes,
our forensic scientists

282
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,519
noticed a reddish cast
that tested positive for blood.

283
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:53,207
Peter Dixon's blood.

284
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:55,167
John...

285
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:59,806
did you shoot Peter and Gwenda Dixon
with this gun?

286
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,975
- What are you doing, John?
- John...

287
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,367
Sit down, John.

288
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,461
Erin James?

289
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:47,742
Erin Davies. I'm married.

290
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,421
Hi, Erin.

291
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,861
I'm Detective Inspector
Ella Richards.

292
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:55,261
This is Detective Superintendent
Steve Wilkins.

293
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,782
Mm, I remember you.

294
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:08,661
Erin, we've recently arrested a man

295
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:11,342
on suspicion of
committing four murders.

296
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,900
We also believe he was the man
who attacked you

297
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:15,581
and your friends in 1996.

298
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,661
After all this time?

299
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:21,661
I'm so sorry.
I realise this must be a shock.

300
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,601
Why couldn't you have done this
13 years ago?

301
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:26,661
Erin...

302
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,301
may I say something?

303
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,302
We know we let you down.

304
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:38,900
All we want is to see to it the man
who hurt you and your friends

305
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:41,101
never gets to hurt anyone else
ever again.

306
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:43,369
And you can help make that happen.

307
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:47,501
All of you will be assigned
Family Liaison Officers

308
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,700
to support you and your family
through the process.

309
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:51,420
The trial won't be for weeks yet.

310
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:53,941
I won't be taking part in any trial.

311
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,261
None of you will be required
to appear in court.

312
00:20:56,262 --> 00:20:58,796
Everything will be done
via video link.

313
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:02,541
You won't have to be
in the same room as him.

314
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,421
My husband doesn't know I was raped.

315
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,941
How was it?

316
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:21,621
Leanne Dauncey will testify.

317
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:24,620
Erin's angry, but Leanne thinks
she can talk her round.

318
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:27,821
Karen Joseph's out of the question.
She's practically housebound.

319
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:31,342
She's had mental health issues
ever since the attack.

320
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:33,581
The two boys won't cooperate,
either.

321
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:37,781
Not after everything that happened
with the original investigation.

322
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:40,660
<i>The trial begins
at Swansea Crown Court tomorrow</i>

323
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:45,181
<i>of 65-year-old John William Cooper
of Letterston, Pembrokeshire.</i>

324
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,980
<i>Cooper has been charged
with the four murders</i>

325
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,940
<i>and with the rape
and indecent assault</i>

326
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:54,141
<i>of two teenage girls
at Milford Haven in 1996.</i>

327
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:07,101
The defence will make much
of the fact that the khaki shorts

328
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:09,221
are indeed women's shorts.

329
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:12,581
That it makes no sense
that the defendant was wearing them

330
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,382
when he brutally murdered
Mr and Mrs Dixon.

331
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:19,822
But murder cases have a habit
of defying common sense.

332
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:23,662
According to the son
of Mr and Mrs Dixon...

333
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:27,861
...whenever his parents went walking
and his mother was wearing

334
00:22:27,862 --> 00:22:30,940
long trousers, she would always
put a pair of shorts

335
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:34,862
in her backpack
in case the weather turned warm.

336
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:37,701
But no shorts of any description
were found

337
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:39,876
at the Coastal Path crime scene.

338
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,221
Why?

339
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:46,980
Imagine the sequence of events,
ladies and gentlemen.

340
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:51,262
The defendant shoots the Dixons
at close range.

341
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:55,022
He then moves their bodies
and covers them with branches.

342
00:22:55,062 --> 00:22:58,062
In the process,
some of their blood -

343
00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:02,180
judging by these distressing images,
probably a lot of their blood -

344
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,901
gets onto his trousers.

345
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:09,381
In a panic, he goes through
his victims' backpacks and finds...

346
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:13,701
...Mrs Dixon's khaki shorts.

347
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,980
He removes
his own blood-stained trousers

348
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:19,901
and puts on Mrs Dixon's shorts
and quits the scene,

349
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:23,542
taking his trousers with him,
unaware that a single spot

350
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:28,621
of Peter Dixon's blood
had found its way onto the shorts.

351
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:37,062
How come you're not inside?

352
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:41,421
The SIO is the last Crown witness.

353
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:45,061
I'm not allowed in
until I give my evidence.

354
00:23:45,062 --> 00:23:46,662
How are you feeling?

355
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:49,701
Ready as I'll ever be.

356
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:52,342
Come on.

357
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:59,862
This police artist's impression
was based on

358
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,341
a witness sighting of the defendant
as he withdrew cash

359
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:07,621
from a NatWest ATM in Haverfordwest
using Peter Dixon's bank card.

360
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:12,542
The sighting was made two days after
the murder and yet, incredibly,

361
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:16,461
the defendant was still wearing
Mrs Dixon's khaki shorts.

362
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:21,381
A hugely incriminating piece of
evidence linking him to two murders.

363
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:26,421
Why on earth had he not disposed of
them at the earliest opportunity?

364
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:30,701
Think about what that says about
the mind of John William Cooper.

365
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:33,262
Was he thumbing his nose
at the world,

366
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:38,302
convinced that he was too clever
to be caught for his horrific crime?

367
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:42,582
Or was his motivation darker,
stranger?

368
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:48,181
Did he regard Mrs Dixon's shorts
as a trophy to be worn with pride...

369
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:53,981
...and perhaps just a touch
of sexual gratification?

370
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:57,742
Whatever the explanation,
this drawing shows a killer

371
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:00,822
wearing an item of clothing
stolen from a woman

372
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,181
he has murdered in cold blood.

373
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:06,102
The defendant has always maintained

374
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:08,581
that this drawing
bears no resemblance to himself

375
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:11,062
as he was in the summer of 1989.

376
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:14,141
But due to an extraordinary
quirk of fate,

377
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:16,781
one month before
the Coastal Path murders,

378
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,502
his likeness was captured on video

379
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:23,318
during his appearance on a game show
on national television.

380
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:26,515
The resulting image speaks volumes.

381
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:36,621
This is you.

382
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,461
Now, he can see you.
But you can't see him.

383
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:42,981
And, er... be warned.

384
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,700
His defence barrister
will be rough with you.

385
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:48,061
He'll try and paint you
as the unreliable witness

386
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:49,460
with an axe to grind.

387
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:51,221
No worries, Steve.

388
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:53,021
I've got my dragon scales
for protection.

389
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:55,822
<i>Let's have the jury back in,
please.</i>

390
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:04,821
Both the barristers
will refer to you as Adrian.

391
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:07,180
That's just so the jury
doesn't get confused.

392
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:08,421
No problem.

393
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:11,741
<i>Mr Evans, are you content to
begin your cross-examination...?</i>

394
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:13,676
Why did you change your name?

395
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:18,568
Cos he was the one
that called me Adrian.

396
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:22,235
It was more of a girl's name
back then.

397
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:26,701
You know that Johnny Cash song,
A Boy Named Sue?

398
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:29,542
He played it constantly.

399
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:33,502
"Adrian, they're playing your song."

400
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,622
He said he called me a girl's name

401
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:39,523
for the same reason
as the father in the song.

402
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,661
To toughen me up...

403
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:44,141
...cos I'd have to fight.

404
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,529
Maybe it's the one thing
he got right.

405
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:50,542
I'm a stubborn bastard.

406
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:53,781
Isn't it true, Adrian,

407
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:57,661
that when you were living
at 28 Rose Meadow Lane

408
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,380
you often used to wear
your father's clothes?

409
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:02,502
No, I never wore his clothes.

410
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,661
What about gloves, Adrian?

411
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:08,140
Isn't it true that you were
the glove-wearer of the family?

412
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:11,062
I used to wear gloves.
But so did he.

413
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:13,342
And who do you mean by "he"?

414
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:17,542
John Cooper.

415
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,542
Your father?

416
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:23,621
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:27,862
Isn't it true, Adrian,
that from the age of 11

418
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:31,581
you started to become disobedient
both at home and at school?

419
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:33,221
Yes, a bit, maybe.

420
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,620
Your disobedience developed
into theft, did it not,

421
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,501
stealing money from your mother
and father?

422
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:38,542
No!

423
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:40,900
I never stole any money
from my parents.

424
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:42,421
I'm not a thief.

425
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,980
A few days after the murders
of Mr and Mrs Dixon,

426
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,461
a gold band was sold
to a jewellers in Pembroke Dock,

427
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,141
which the prosecution claim

428
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:57,261
was the wedding ring the killer
removed from Peter Dixon's corpse.

429
00:27:57,262 --> 00:28:00,501
The transaction was recorded
by the jeweller on a receipt

430
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:03,941
bearing the signature J Cooper.

431
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,741
The court has heard
that your father,

432
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:08,542
John William Cooper,
stated that the sig...

433
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,555
...jeweller's receipt was not...

434
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,862
...and that the usual form
of his signature is JW Cooper.

435
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:18,420
Isn't it true, Adrian,
that when you lived at...

436
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,140
<i>28 Rose Meadow Lane, you were in</i>

437
00:28:21,141 --> 00:28:23,861
the habit of forging the signatures
of both your mother and father

438
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:26,821
for the purpose of fraudulently
cashing cheques in their names?

439
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:28,061
No, that's totally untrue.

440
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:29,980
You deny that you were
an accomplished forger

441
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:31,541
of both your mother...

442
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,541
<i>...and father's signature?</i>

443
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:36,220
- I can't hear what you're saying.
- Can't hear...

444
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:38,342
...or refuse to hear, Adrian?

445
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:40,940
Sorry, Mr Evans, we're having
a technical issue this end.

446
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:44,013
Your voice keeps cutting out.
One minute, please.

447
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,821
Carry on, Mr Evans.
It should be OK now.

448
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:55,542
<i>I put it to you, Adrian,</i>

449
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:58,940
<i>that for reasons known
only to yourself, you have long</i>

450
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:02,021
harboured a passionate vendetta
against your father.

451
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:03,980
<i>That, because of this vendetta,</i>

452
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,021
in your dealings
with the police in both

453
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:08,460
the Huntsman
and the Ottawa investigations,

454
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,221
you have done everything
in your power

455
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:13,940
<i>to assist them in
their singled-minded persecution</i>

456
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:15,381
of your father.

457
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,101
Indeed, that you see your appearance
in court today as merely

458
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:20,460
<i>another opportunity
to spread more lies.</i>

459
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:22,928
Do you really think
I want to be here?

460
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:41,168
Erin, Leanne,
thank you for coming.

461
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,461
These are our parents
and Erin's husband.

462
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:49,541
Er, we'll show you to the room
you'll be giving your evidence from.

463
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:53,742
We've decided
to give our evidence in court.

464
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:55,742
Oh?

465
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,542
Karen died.

466
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:01,221
What happened?

467
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:02,862
Her health...

468
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,901
finally gave out.

469
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:08,381
- We're doing this for her.
- Yeah.

470
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:10,488
- And Stephen and David.
- Yeah.

471
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,741
Are you OK?

472
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:25,221
Tissues and water.

473
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,461
We often played in the woods...

474
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:48,941
by our estate.

475
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:52,461
There was a rope swing.

476
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:54,769
So, we were mucking about on that.

477
00:30:57,661 --> 00:30:59,181
About...

478
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:02,221
eight o'clock it got dark,
so we headed home.

479
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:05,206
We took the shortcut
across the farmer's field.

480
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:10,141
We were about halfway along
when we heard a noise.

481
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:14,141
We all turned round...

482
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:18,149
and saw someone coming towards us,
shining a torch in our eyes.

483
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:23,461
I thought it was a boy we knew,
so I shouted at him...

484
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:29,622
..."Shine the light in our eyes,
why don't you, Martin?"

485
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:34,822
But the person shouted back
in a man's voice...

486
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:38,502
..."Do I look like Martin?"

487
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:43,329
We all thought
it was the farmer then.

488
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:45,302
But, erm...

489
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:51,661
as he came closer, we could see he
had a mask on over his head with...

490
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,502
holes for the mouth and eyes...

491
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:58,102
and er, he had a shotgun
pointing at us.

492
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:05,822
Er, David started to apologise
to the man for us being on his land.

493
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:08,302
The man told him to shut up

494
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:10,981
and er, he...

495
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:13,556
hit him over the head
with the shotgun.

496
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:15,621
And, erm...

497
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:21,742
...David started crying then.

498
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:26,342
And then he told us to walk down
to the lower part of the field,

499
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:28,901
which you can't see from the estate.

500
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,022
He...

501
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,181
made us say our names.

502
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:36,221
His voice was angry.

503
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:37,996
We were all really scared.

504
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:41,949
And then he told us
to lie down on the ground...

505
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:44,916
...and keep our faces in the grass.

506
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,661
And then I felt him...

507
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,381
pulling my hair at the back.

508
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:57,742
He told me to stand up...

509
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:04,341
...and to go with him.

510
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:09,821
Mrs Davies, the ordeal
that you and your friends suffered

511
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,141
on the evening of 6th March 1996

512
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:14,941
happened 15 years ago.

513
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:16,661
You were a girl of 16.

514
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:17,862
Yeah.

515
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:20,582
You were terrified. It was dark.

516
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:21,660
Given all that,

517
00:33:21,661 --> 00:33:23,861
how reliable
do you think your memory is

518
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:25,929
of the events which took place?

519
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:29,981
I remember every detail
like it was yesterday.

520
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,942
You don't forget
something like that.

521
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:37,742
You try to.

522
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:40,862
But you can't.

523
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:44,381
Did the man who attacked you
ever remove his mask?

524
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:46,661
No.

525
00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:49,621
So, to be clear...

526
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:55,421
...at no time did you, or any
of your friends, see his face?

527
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,542
No.

528
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:22,323
This man in the photograph
is the real John Cooper.

529
00:34:22,324 --> 00:34:25,972
A loving husband who was married
to his wife for 42 years.

530
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:29,684
We had a son
who was the apple of our eye.

531
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:34,747
An apple that went bad
and broke his mother's heart.

532
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:38,764
I believe that the heart attack
that killed my wife

533
00:34:38,804 --> 00:34:40,937
was brought on because of the...

534
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:44,804
the stress,
the sadness and the shame

535
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:49,003
because of all the time that I spent
in prison as an innocent man.

536
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:52,923
The police and Mr Elias
tell you I'm a liar.

537
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:56,604
That I'm lying when I say
that most of my clothes,

538
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:59,603
most significantly,
my khaki bathers, were second-hand.

539
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:00,804
Well...

540
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:03,283
obviously, they don't know
what it's like to be poor.

541
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:06,123
This suit that I'm wearing today,
it's second-hand.

542
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:07,643
In my wardrobe at home,

543
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:11,804
I've got an overcoat second-hand
that I wore to my wife's funeral.

544
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:16,723
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I spent ten years of my life

545
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:19,042
in prison
for crimes that I did not commit.

546
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:21,284
Please... Please, do not allow

547
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:25,644
the police to carry out another
miscarriage of justice against me.

548
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:28,563
I am not a murderer.

549
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:30,724
I am not a rapist.

550
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:33,684
I am an innocent man
who's been wronged.

551
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:35,084
Thank you.

552
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:38,764
Mr Elias...

553
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,362
it's a quarter to four.

554
00:35:40,363 --> 00:35:43,323
This would probably be
a suitable time for me to rise.

555
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:45,603
Are you content to begin
your cross-examination

556
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,123
of Mr Cooper tomorrow?

557
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:48,562
If My Lord would permit,

558
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,002
I would like to have
a few minutes with Mr Cooper.

559
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:54,164
- Very well, Mr Elias.
- Thank you, My Lord.

560
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:56,204
All right, Mr Cooper...

561
00:35:56,244 --> 00:35:58,562
I would like to ask you
a few questions about

562
00:35:58,563 --> 00:36:00,362
the balaclava which was discovered

563
00:36:00,363 --> 00:36:02,962
under the hedgerow near the scene
of the Sardis robbery.

564
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:05,764
Ladies and gentlemen,
you will remember

565
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:10,644
that this is the balaclava which,
in the course of the Huntsman trial,

566
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:12,044
it was found that

567
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:15,860
there were a number of the
defendant's head hairs within it.

568
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:21,244
Could you please give Mr Cooper
exhibit MTJ/14, please?

569
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:25,563
It's all right, Mr Cooper.

570
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:27,522
The item has been cleared
forensically.

571
00:36:27,523 --> 00:36:30,390
Touching it won't compromise you
in any way.

572
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:36,684
Mr Cooper...

573
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:38,404
is that your balaclava?

574
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:41,042
To the best of my knowledge.

575
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:42,723
Yes or no, Mr Cooper?

576
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:47,043
Yes. But I did not commit
the Sardis robbery.

577
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:49,283
Like I said,
that was stolen off my boat

578
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:51,042
long before it was found
under the hedgerow.

579
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,843
But you accept
that the balaclava is yours?

580
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:56,483
Yes.

581
00:36:56,523 --> 00:37:01,363
Mr Cooper, that isn't what you told
the jury during the Huntsman trial

582
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:02,923
in 1998, is it?

583
00:37:03,963 --> 00:37:05,684
I know. I made a mistake.

584
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:11,164
During that trial, under oath, you
denied that the balaclava was yours.

585
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:15,443
So, my question to you, Mr Cooper,

586
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,644
is were you lying to the jury
then...

587
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:22,012
- or are you lying to the jury now?
- I'm not a liar.

588
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,842
- I forgot. I made a mistake.
- Let me rephrase the question.

589
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,123
What was the truth?

590
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:30,002
What you told the jury in 1998
or what you've told the jury today?

591
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:32,363
No, I didn't deliberately...

592
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:33,522
I misremembered.

593
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:37,724
Misremembered in 1998
or misremembered today, Mr Cooper?

594
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:42,804
Mr Cooper...

595
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,402
the question is a simple one.

596
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:45,604
Which was it?

597
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:50,164
What you said to the court in 1998
or what you have told us today?

598
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:57,443
Today.

599
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:01,403
So, you admit that in 1998
you lied to that jury?

600
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:03,710
- Yes, but...
- Thank you, My Lord.

601
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:10,764
So...

602
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:13,444
...members of the jury...

603
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:18,188
...it is now time for you to retire
to consider your verdicts.

604
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:22,483
Remember, at all times,
you must keep in mind

605
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:26,842
that it is for the Crown to prove
the guilt of John William Cooper...

606
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:30,523
...not for the defence
to prove his innocence.

607
00:38:30,563 --> 00:38:35,284
If the Crown have failed to do that,
then you must find him...

608
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:36,843
not guilty.

609
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:58,403
- All right?
- Yeah.

610
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:00,883
What are those?

611
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,123
That's my post-verdict statements
for the press.

612
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:04,923
Guilty. Not guilty.

613
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:09,523
Well, you can get rid of that one.

614
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:11,724
That's my letter of resignation.

615
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:13,324
What?

616
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:16,307
I'd have failed the victims
and their families.

617
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:31,244
Verdict.

618
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:32,564
All rise!

619
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:38,724
Whatever the judgment is...

620
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:40,764
<i>we receive it with dignity.</i>

621
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:45,644
Ella, Lynne, Glyn, Nigel, Rambo,
it's been an honour

622
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,403
and a privilege.

623
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,724
- Cheers, boss.
- Cheers, boss.

624
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:57,231
Let's have the jury in,
please.

625
00:40:17,244 --> 00:40:19,644
Will the foreman
please stand?

626
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:23,724
Will the defendant please stand?

627
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:28,163
My Lord,
the jury has been in retirement

628
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:31,108
- for eight hours and ten minutes.
- Thank you.

629
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,724
Mr Foreman, please answer
my next question yes or no.

630
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:40,083
<i>Have you reached a verdict
on which you are all agreed?</i>

631
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:41,644
Yes.

632
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:44,604
Is that in relation
to all 11 counts?

633
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:45,883
Yes.

634
00:40:46,923 --> 00:40:50,883
On count one of the indictment,

635
00:40:50,923 --> 00:40:54,244
do you find the defendant,

636
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:55,964

00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:05,804

00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:21,684

00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:29,644
Guilty.

647
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:33,604
On count five of the indictment,

648
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:35,483
the rape of Erin Davies,

649
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,963
<i>nee James...</i>

650
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:39,924
<i>...guilty or not guilty?</i>

651
00:41:42,963 --> 00:41:44,923
- Guilty.
- Rubbish!

652
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,923
<i>That's rubbish!</i>

653
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,084
I'm not a child rapist!

654
00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:50,683
This is not justice!

655
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:55,042
On count six of the indictment, the
indecent assault of Leanne Dauncey,

656
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:56,804
guilty or not guilty?

657
00:41:58,324 --> 00:42:00,164
<i>- Guilty.
- This is rubbish!</i>

658
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:02,002
You've not heard all the evidence!

659
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:04,470
This is a fit-up!
This is not justice!

660
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:07,203
Mr Cooper, be quiet,
or I will have you removed.

661
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:09,204
We love you, John!

662
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:13,443
On counts seven, eight, nine, ten
and 11,

663
00:42:13,483 --> 00:42:17,923
the offences of attempted robbery,
guilty or not guilty?

664
00:42:17,963 --> 00:42:19,284
Guilty.

665
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:22,763
John William Cooper,

666
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:26,123
the jury have found you guilty
of all 11 counts on the indictment.

667
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:27,562
Shut up, you stupid bastard!

668
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:30,764
I hereby sentence you
to life imprisonment.

669
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:33,243
The crimes for which
you have been convicted

670
00:42:33,244 --> 00:42:37,443
are of such evil wickedness,
the mandatory sentence of life...

671
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:40,804
- This is not justice!
- ..will mean just that.

672
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:43,843
- I'm an innocent man!
- Take him down.

673
00:42:43,883 --> 00:42:45,804
This is not justice!

674
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:47,402
This is persecution!

675
00:42:47,403 --> 00:42:51,843
Persecution of John Cooper,
carried out by Steve Wilkins!

676
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:55,362
A man is gonna spend time in prison
for a crime he did not commit!

677
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:57,896
I am not a rapist!
I am not a murderer!

678
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,363
This is a fit-up!

679
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:04,070
I am not a murderer!

680
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:15,203
Today's verdicts give the families
of Richard and Helen Thomas,

681
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:16,882
Peter and Gwenda Dixon,

682
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:19,442
and the five victims
of the Nolton Hill attack

683
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:22,003
and their families justice.

684
00:43:22,043 --> 00:43:24,803
But there is no sentence
the court could have imposed

685
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:25,962
on John William Cooper

686
00:43:25,963 --> 00:43:28,907
that could ever compensate them
for their loss.

687
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:32,923
Today's verdicts
are a warning to all individuals

688
00:43:32,963 --> 00:43:35,163
who would commit
such terrible crimes.

689
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:36,844
Whatever they touch...

690
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,962
...will bear witness against them.

691
00:43:39,963 --> 00:43:41,443
Evidence lasts.

692
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:43,164
It does not forget.

693
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,764
And it cannot lie.

694
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:51,228
And it will always be found
by those with the will to find it.

695
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,483
Thank you.

696
00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:00,724
On behalf of Dyfed Powys Police,

697
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:04,442
I would like to pay tribute
to the officers of Operation Ottawa

698
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:08,003
for their diligence
and their professionalism.

699
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:12,897
Are you ready for your exclusive,
Mr Hill?

700
00:44:13,244 --> 00:44:14,563
Thanks, Steve.

701
00:44:16,204 --> 00:44:18,003
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

702
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:25,748
Detective Superintendent, can I get
your reaction to today's sentencing?

703
00:44:29,363 --> 00:44:31,362
Yeah, really great. Really nice.

704
00:44:31,363 --> 00:44:33,323
- Yeah?
- Brilliant. Yeah, it's amazing.

705
00:44:33,324 --> 00:44:35,004
- Great.
- It's all here.

706
00:44:35,043 --> 00:44:36,203
- He loves it?
- Yeah.

707
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:38,363
- Awesome.
- It's all yours.

708
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:40,204
- Much appreciated.
- Enjoy.

709
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,244
I'll look after it, I promise.

710
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,284
Thanks.

711
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:08,684
Boss...

712
00:45:08,724 --> 00:45:10,524
Visitor for you downstairs.

713
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:19,483
Hey, what's this?

714
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:22,283
- I thought you were in school?
- Yeah, I got the afternoon off.

715
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:24,723
I thought I'd come and see
where it all happened.

716
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:27,324
Well, there's not much to see now.

717
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:33,923
"There is no greater responsibility
or duty placed on a human being

718
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:36,763
"than to investigate
the circumstances of the death

719
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:38,444
"of another human being."

720
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:41,963
Quite the job description, eh?

721
00:45:58,204 --> 00:46:00,604
I've decided
sixth form's not for me.

722
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:03,324
Are you OK with that?

723
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:06,804
- Does your mother know?
- Yeah.

724
00:46:08,003 --> 00:46:09,203
She blames you.

725
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:11,804
Of course she does.

726
00:46:16,363 --> 00:46:18,696
I'm thinking of joining the police.

727
00:46:20,764 --> 00:46:22,124
Seriously?

728
00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:24,842
What about the football?

729
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:26,563
Ah, come on, Dad.

730
00:46:26,604 --> 00:46:29,324
I'm good, but I'm not that good.

731
00:46:29,363 --> 00:46:32,243
What makes you think
you'd be any better as a policeman?

732
00:46:32,244 --> 00:46:34,083
You made a success of it.
How hard can it be?

733
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:36,043
Watch it!

734
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:20,084
I should've stayed.

735
00:47:23,604 --> 00:47:25,443
We should've talked.

736
00:47:29,923 --> 00:47:31,804
I'm sorry, Ma.
