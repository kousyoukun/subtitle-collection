8
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,130
他们都讨厌你  曼达佬
They all hate you, Mando.

9
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,980
因为你是个传奇
Because you're a legend!

10
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,740
多少人有追踪器
How many had fobs?

11
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,610
他们都有
All of them.

12
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,240
他们要拿它怎么样
What's gonna happen to it?

13
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,370
我没问过
I didn't ask.

14
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,460
这有背公会准则
It's against the Guild Code.

15
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,830
{\an8}前情回顾

16
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,220
索根星球

17
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,140
没有星港  也没有工业中心  没有人口密集区
No star port, no industrial centers, no population density.

18
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,140
我要把他留在这里
I'm leaving him here.

19
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,790
和我一起流浪  这不是小孩该过的生活
Traveling with me, that's no life for a kid.

20
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,030
他们知道他在这
They know he's here.

21
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,310
是的
Yes.

22
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,970
他们会一直来找他的
Then they'll keep coming.

23
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,740
是的
Yes.

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,000
{\an8}《星球大战》

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,480
把孩子交出来  曼达佬
Hand over the child, Mando.

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,520
也许我能放你一条生路
I might let you live.

27
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,750
抓紧了
Hold on.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,380
来啊
Come on.

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,490
我能捉活的  也能捉死的
I can bring you in warm or I can bring you in cold.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,630
那是我的台词
That's my line.

31
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,170
{\an8}《曼达洛人》

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,420
{\an8}第一季  第五章

33
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,420
{\an8}杀手

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,790
燃料泄漏
Losing fuel.

35
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,290
这里是莫斯·埃斯利指挥塔
This is Mos Eisley Tower.

36
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,350
我们在追踪你
We are tracking you.

37
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,220
请将飞船停到到35号港  完毕
Head for bay three-five, over.

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,210
收到
Copy that.

39
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
锁定35号
Locked in for three-five.

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,980
嗨
Hey!

41
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,960
怎么回事
Hey!

42
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,770
你打坏了我的一个机器人  你得赔偿
You damage one of my droids, you'll pay for it.

43
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,630
让它们离我的飞船远一点
Just keep them away from my ship.

44
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,720
是吗  你觉得这是个好主意吗
Yeah? You think that's a good idea, do ya?

45
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,720
看看你的飞船
Let's look at your ship.

46
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,020
看看这堆破烂
Oof! Look at that.

47
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,040
你这顶上有很多碳痕啊
Ugh, you got a lot of carbon scorin' building up top.

48
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,120
我乍一看  还以为你刚经历了一场交火
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were in a shootout.

49
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,890
得用专门的工具修
Special tool for that one.

50
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,200
我得把那里调一下
I am gonna have to rotate that.

51
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,660
你燃料泄漏了
You got a fuel leak.

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,420
看看那儿  真是一团糟
Look at that, this is a mess.

53
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,060
你怎么着陆的  要修这个可得劳你破费了
How did you even land? That's gonna set you back.

54
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,830
我这有500帝国信用点
I've got 500 Imperial Credits.

55
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,970
就这点
That's all you got?

56
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,490
你们觉得怎么样呢
Well, what do you guys think?

57
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,050
这应该够交你的停机费了
That should at least cover the hangar.

58
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,690
我会把钱付给你的
I'll get you your money.

59
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,490
这话我可没少听
Hmm. I've heard that before.

60
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,150
只要记住
Just remember...

61
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,490
不要机器人  听你说过了  不用再强调了
Yeah, no droids. I heard ya. You don't have to say it twice.

62
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,170
天啊
Jeez.

63
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,320
真是个混蛋
Womp rat.

64
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,880
我跟
I'm in.

65
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,730
再加三个螺栓和一个飞行舵
And I am gonna raise you three bolts and a motivator.

66
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,920
安静  快  把我的爆能步枪拿来
Shh. Quick, grab my blaster rifle.

67
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,700
如果我是你的话  我就会乖乖地待在飞船里
I'd stay in that ship if I were you.

68
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,900
什么
What?

69
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,610
过来  过来
Now, now.

70
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,510
让我好好瞧瞧你
Let Peli take a good look at you.

71
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,390
好样的  小乖乖
All right, there you go.

72
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,490
那个赏金猎人居然把你一个人丢在了这破飞船里
Did that bounty hunter leave you all alone in that big nasty ship?

73
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,020
我怎么知道这是什么东西  让我想想
How do I know what it is? Give me a second.

74
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,660
乖乖  你要吃点东西吗
All right. Now, would you like some food?

75
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,360
你饿了吗
Are you hungry?

76
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,060
拿点吃的来  快点
Okay. Fetch us something to eat. Quick!

77
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,660
我不知道  带骨头的就行
I don't know... Something with bones in it.

78
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,640
有了
Okay.

79
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,740
我知道怎么办了
Now, here's the plan.

80
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,130
我会一直照顾你到那个曼达洛人回来
I am going to look after you until The Mandalorian gets back,

81
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,140
然后我会额外收取他一些看护费
and then I'm gonna charge him extra for watching you.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,930
懂了吗  大眼睛
You see how that works? Yeah, bright eyes?

83
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,220
我们是一伙的了
We're a team. Mmm-hmm.

84
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,090
机器人  我是名赏金猎人  想找份活干
Hey, droid, I'm a hunter. I'm lookin' for some work

85
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,830
可惜  塔图因的赏金猎人公会已经不复存在了
Unfortunately, the Bounty Guild no longer operates from Tatooine.

86
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,120
我不是找公会的工作
I'm not looking for Guild work.

87
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,280
但依我计算
I am afraid that does not improve your situation,

88
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,560
这也不会有什么改变
at least by my calculation.

89
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,810
再想想看  铁皮
Think again, tin can.

90
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,220
伙计  要找工作的话  不妨过来坐坐
If you're looking for work, have a seat, my friend.

91
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,060
﻿我叫托罗  托罗·卡里肯
Name's Toro, Toro Calican.

92
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,770
来吧  别紧张
Come on, relax.

93
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,430
{\an8}芬内克·尚德  悬赏价七十一万

94
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,430
这个赏金定位器是我离开中环之前领的
Picked up this Bounty Puck before I left the Mid Rim.

95
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,800
芬内克·尚德  一个刺客
Fennec Shand, an Assassin.

96
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,770
听说她自从新共和国将她的雇主们关押后
Heard she's been on the run ever since the New Republic

97
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,720
就一直在亡命奔逃
put all her employers in lockdown.

98
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,460
我听说过她
I know the name.

99
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,250
我跟着追踪器到这里
I followed this tracking fob here.

100
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,650
现在定位信息
Now the positional data

101
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,700
显示她朝着沙丘之海的方向去了
suggests she's headed out beyond the Dune Sea.

102
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,980
应该是份简单的活
Should be an easy job.

103
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,790
那就祝你好运了
Well, good luck with that.

104
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,720
等等  等等  我以为你需要找活干呢
Wait, wait, wait, hey. I thought you needed work?

105
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,690
你加入公会多久了
How long with the Guild?

106
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,740
很久了
Long enough.

107
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,140
很明显不是  芬内克·尚德是一名精英雇佣兵
Clearly not. Fennec Shand is an elite mercenary.

108
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,640
她因替顶尖犯罪集团杀人而成名
She made her name killing for all the top crime syndicates,

109
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,070
赫特人便是其中之一
including the Hutts.

110
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,790
如果你追杀她  你就看不到明天的太阳了
If you go after her, you won't make it past sunrise.

111
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,740
这是我第一份活
This is my first job.

112
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,170
你可以拿佣金  所有佣金
You can keep the money, all of it.

113
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,590
我得完成任务  才能加入公会
I just need this job to get into the Guild.

114
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,970
我一个人完成不了
I can't do it alone.

115
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,660
半小时内去35号港见我
Meet me at Hangar three-five in half an hour.

116
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,160
带两辆飞行摩托来  把追踪器给我
Bring two speeder bikes and give me the tracking fob.

117
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,090
别担心  我都记住了
Don't worry, got it all memorized.

118
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,550
半小时后见
Half an hour.

119
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,290
看来咱俩现在是一条绳上的蚂蚱了  伙计
Looks like you're stuck with me now, partner.

120
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,660
我很清醒  我没睡觉
I'm awake! I'm awake!

121
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
-他在哪里  -小点声
- Where is he? - Quiet!

122
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,890
乖乖别哭  你把他吵醒了
Oh. It's okay. You woke it up.

123
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,040
你知道我用了多久才把他哄睡的吗
Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,280
-把他给我  -别急啊
- Give him to me. - Not so fast!

125
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,760
你不能就那样把孩子一个人留下
You can't just leave a child all alone like that.

126
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,490
你完全不会带孩子
You know, you have an awful lot to learn about raisin' a young one.

127
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,330
好了  我已经开始修漏油的问题了
Anyway, I started the repair on the fuel leak.

128
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,810
就这样了
There you go.

129
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,010
我跟你说  修这玩意难度不小呢
I had a couple setbacks I want to talk to you about.

130
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,730
我按你要求的  没用机器人
You know, I didn't use any droids, as requested,

131
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,040
所以要修好比我预期的要更久
so it took me a lot longer than I expected.

132
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,200
但我想你应该不会吝啬额外费用吧
But I figured you were good for the money

133
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,640
毕竟还有一张嘴要养活呢
since you have an extra mouth to feed.

134
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,700
谢谢
Thank you.

135
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,930
我猜到了  你找到活干了  对吗
Oh, I guess I was right. You got a job, didn't you?

136
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,260
给这些机器人充电
You know, it's costing me a lot of money

137
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,820
都得花我不少钱
to keep these droids even powered up.

138
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,650
曼达佬  怎么样
Hey, Mando, what do you think?

139
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,640
还凑合吧
Not too shabby, huh?

140
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,110
你指望啥呢  这又不是科雷利亚  夫人你好
What'd you expect? This ain't Corellia. Ma'am.

141
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,320
-咋了  -前面有情况
- What's going on? - Look. Up ahead.

142
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,250
塔斯肯掠夺者
Tusken Raiders.

143
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,760
我听本地人讲过这些肮脏的家伙
I heard the locals talking about this filth.

144
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,060
塔斯肯人认为他们才是本地人
Tuskens think they're the locals.

145
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,620
其他人都是非法入侵的
Everyone else is just trespassing.

146
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,300
不管他们怎么看  最好离我们远点
Whatever they call themselves, they best keep their distance.

147
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,710
你自己跟他们说吧
Yeah? Why don't you tell them yourself?

148
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,180
放松
Relax.

149
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,320
-你在干嘛  -谈判
- What are you doing? - Negotiating.

150
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,740
什么情况
What's going on?

151
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,740
我们要通过他们的领地
We need passage across their land.

152
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,490
-把望远镜给我看看  -为什么
- Let me see the binocs. - Why?

153
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,440
搞啥啊
Hey! What?

154
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,380
那可是全新的
Those were brand new.

155
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,400
现在不是了
Yeah? They were.

156
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,740
趴下
Get down.

157
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,820
怎么了
What? Oh.

158
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,060
告诉我  你看到了什么
All right, tell me what you see.

159
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,880
湿背蜥
Dewback.

160
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,880
骑手好像被拖着在走
Looks like the rider is still attached.

161
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,940
是她吗  是我们的目标吗
Is that her? Is that the target?

162
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,520
我不知道
I don't know.

163
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,600
我去看看
I'll go.

164
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,300
你掩护我
You cover me.

165
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,560
记得趴下
Stay down.

166
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,420
是她吗  她死了吗
Well, is it her? Is she dead?

167
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,140
又是一个赏金猎人
It's another bounty hunter.

168
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,580
那些东西你别都拿了
Hey, I hope you don't plan on keeping all that stuff for yourself.

169
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,660
至少把爆能枪留给我吧
Can I at least have that blaster?

170
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,100
趴下
Get down!

171
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,600
曼达佬
Mando!

172
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,040
怎么了
What happened?

173
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,580
狙击枪
Sniper bolt.

174
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,500
只有改装过的MK型步枪才能打出如此一枪
Only an MK-modified rifle could make that shot.

175
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,300
你没事吧
Are you all right?

176
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,100
没事  只打中了盔甲
Yeah. Hit me in the beskar,

177
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,760
这种程度曼达洛铁还承受的来
and at that range beskar held up.

178
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,360
等下  我可没有曼达洛铁
Wait, I don't wear any beskar.

179
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,680
是没有
Nope.

180
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,340
那我们该怎么办
Well, so what do we do?

181
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,460
你有看见是从哪里打过来的吗
You see where that shot came from?

182
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,640
看到  在山脊那边打过来的
Yeah, it came from that ridge.

183
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,140
好吧  我们等到天黑
Okay, we're gonna wait until dark.

184
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,840
那她逃走了怎么办
Well, what if she escapes?

185
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,260
她可是在高地
She's got the high ground.

186
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,360
她会等我们先出手的
She'll wait for us to make the first move.

187
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,880
我先去休息
I'm gonna rest.

188
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,540
你守第一轮
You take the first watch.

189
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,040
别出去
Stay low!

190
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,960
好了  太阳下山了
All right, suns are down.

191
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,760
是时候出发了  曼达佬
Time to ride, Mando.

192
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
快点  快醒醒
Come on, wake up.

193
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,120
看看你
Look at you,

194
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,540
在任务途中睡着  老家伙
asleep on the job, old man.

195
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,820
玩够了吗
You done?

196
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,380
够了  我只是想
Yeah. I was just, you know,

197
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,520
叫醒你  快来吧
waking you up. Come on.

198
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,220
快上车
Get on your bike.

199
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,100
尽可能骑快点去到山石那边
Ride as fast as you can towards those rocks.

200
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,000
这就是你的计划
That's your plan?

201
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
她能直接把我们从车上射下来
She'll snipe us right off the bikes.

202
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,080
这是闪光弹
It's a flash charge.

203
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,660
我们交替射击
We alternate shots,

204
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,980
这能暂时让她失去视野
it'll blind any scope temporarily.

205
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,820
这样的话  我们加速前进还是有机会的
Combine that with our speed and we got a chance.

206
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,000
有机会
A chance?

207
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,140
是你想要这么做的
Hey, you wanted this.

208
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,740
做好准备
Get ready.

209
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,140
射击
Now!

210
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,180
别急着开枪啊  芬内克
Not so fast, Fennec.

211
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,820
注意力分散得好
Nice distraction.

212
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,060
搭档  干得漂亮啊
Yeah, good work, partner.

213
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,180
把自己铐上
Cuff yourself.

214
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,960
去拿那支爆能枪
Why don't you go find your blaster?

215
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,040
曼达洛人
A Mandalorian.

216
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,040
我已经很久没有见到曼达洛人了
It's been a long time since I've seen one of your kind.

217
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,380
去过内瓦罗吗
Ever been to Nevarro?

218
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,360
我听说那里发生的事情着实不咋样啊
I hear things didn't go so well there, but...

219
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,740
但看起来你倒是轻松脱身了
it looks like you got off easy.

220
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,160
我们把你抓起来  你就不用担心
You don't have to worry about gettin' to Nevarro,

221
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,500
内瓦罗或者其他地方了
or anywhere else, once we turn you in.

222
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,320
你知道吗  我真该好好谢谢你
You know, I really should thank you.

223
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
你就是我进入公会的门票
You're my ticket into the Guild.

224
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
不客气
You're welcome.

225
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,240
哦吼  看来我们其中一个必须步行了
Uh oh. Looks like one of us has to walk.

226
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,900
或者我们可以把你拖过去
Or we could drag you.

227
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,660
好吧  计划是什么
All right, so what is the plan?

228
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,100
你去找之前那只湿背蜥
I need you to go find that dewback we saw.

229
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,960
然后你和我的车还有悬赏目标留在这里
And leave you here with my bounty and my ride?

230
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,660
我看不行  曼达佬
Yeah, I don't think so, Mando.

231
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,720
好吧  那我去
Okay, I'll do it.

232
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
看紧她  别让她靠近车
Watch her, and don't let her get near the bike.

233
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,780
她死了对我们没有好处
She's no good to us dead.

234
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,240
过了挺久的了呀
Oh, it's been a while.

235
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,100
看  太阳都升起来了
Oh, look, the suns are coming up.

236
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,180
安静
Quiet.

237
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,360
听着  我现在还有时间
Look, there's still time to make

238
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,080
去莫斯埃斯帕赴约
my rendezvous in Mos Espa.

239
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,760
把我带到那儿去
Take me to it and I can pay

240
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,800
我可以给你两倍悬赏我的钱
you double the price on my head.

241
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,260
我才不想要钱
I don't care about the money.

242
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,500
那么那个曼达洛人把钱都自己留着咯
Oh, so the Mandalorian keeps all the money for himself.

243
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,540
那是因为我允许他那么做的
Only because I let him.

244
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,000
似乎不是这样吧
Doesn't seem that way.

245
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,980
我是说  好像事情都是他做主吧
I mean, it seems like he's calling all the shots.

246
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,500
那只是你自己觉得的
Shows what you know.

247
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,080
我雇了那个曼达佬  这是我的活
I hired Mando, this is my job.

248
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,140
把你抓起来
Bringin' you in will make

249
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,600
能让我成为赏金猎人公会的正式成员
me a full member of the Bounty Hunters Guild.

250
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,440
你已经有了对于公会来说比我更值钱的东西
You already have something the Guild values far more than me.

251
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,980
你只是还不知道而已
You just don't see it.

252
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,540
-什么  -那个曼达洛人
- What? - The Mandalorian.

253
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,820
光是他的盔甲就比我的酬金还值钱了
His armor alone's worth more than my bounty.

254
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,620
我已经告诉你了  我不想要钱
I already told you, I don't care about the money.

255
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,400
那名望呢
Then think what it would do for your reputation.

256
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,440
一个曼达洛人在内瓦罗袭击了公会
A Mandalorian shot up the Guild on Nevarro,

257
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,060
带走了价值极高的目标然后逃走了
took some high value target and went rogue.

258
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,560
那个曼达洛人吗
That Mandalorian?

259
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,700
就像我说的  曼达洛人可不常见
Like I said, you don't see many.

260
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,960
你把那个叛徒带去给公会
You bring the Guild that traitor,

261
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,980
他们就会张开怀抱欢迎你
and they'll welcome you with open arms.

262
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,880
你将成为一代传奇
Your name will be legendary.

263
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,280
我们怎么确定他就是公会想要的人
How can we be sure he's the one?

264
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,120
传言那个目标还在他手里
Word is, he still has the target with him.

265
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,480
有人说那是个孩子
Some say it's a child.

266
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,480
听着  如果你不敢挑战他  别怕
Look, if you're afraid to take him on, fear not.

267
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,120
我会帮助你的
I can help you with that.

268
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,600
听我一句劝  孩子
Take some advice, kid.

269
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,080
你想成为赏金猎人吗
You wanna be a bounty hunter?

270
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,040
将自己的利益最大化  然后努力活下去
Make the best deal for yourself and survive.

271
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,700
不错的建议
That's good advice,

272
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,720
但是如果我把手铐给你摘下来
but if I took those binders off of you

273
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,900
我就活不了了
I'd be a dead man.

274
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,460
但是如果曼达洛人的价值
And if the Mandalorian's worth

275
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,260
比你要高的多  那么
more than you are, well...

276
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,700
谁不想成为传奇呢
Who wouldn't want to be a legend?

277
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,660
谢谢你的建议
Thanks for the tip.

278
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,220
你终于回来了  曼达佬
Took you long enough, Mando.

279
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,800
看起来现在是我说了算  是吧搭档
Looks like I'm calling the shots now. Huh, partner?

280
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,880
放下你的爆能枪  举起手来
Drop your blaster and raise 'em.

281
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,400
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

282
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,480
你是公会的叛徒  曼达佬
You're a Guild traitor, Mando.

283
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,740
而且我敢打赌
And I'm willing to bet that

284
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,660
这就是那个你帮着逃跑的目标
this here is the target you helped escape.

285
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,140
你比你看起来要聪明
You're smarter than you look.

286
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,840
芬内克说得对
Fennec was right.

287
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,680
把你上交不仅能让我成为公会一员
Bringing you in won't just make me a member of the Guild,

288
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,120
还会让我成为传奇
it'll make me legendary.

289
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,960
-后退  -得找到他
- Stay back. - Gotta get it.

290
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,060
他在哪
Where is it?

291
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,360
你在这呢
There you are.

292
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,200
你在跟我们藏猫猫吗
Are you hiding from us? Huh?

293
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,140
看看你
Look at you.

294
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,740
-没关系  -我知道
- That's all right. - I know.

295
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,960
那声音对你大大的耳朵来说太吵了对吧
That was really loud for your big old ears, wasn't it?

296
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,020
没关系的
It's okay. Shh.

297
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,180
小心一点
Be careful with him.

298
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,460
所以我猜你没有得到报酬
So, I take it you didn't get paid?

299
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,020
这些够了吗
That cover me?

300
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,280
是的  当然足够了
Yeah. Yes, this is gonna cover you.

301
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,780
好了  机器人
All right, Pit Droids!

302
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,900
把这个拖出去
Let's drag this outta here!

303
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,420
我哪知道  就把他拖到乞丐谷吧
I don't know, drag it to Beggar's Canyon.
