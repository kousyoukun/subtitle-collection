1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,320
他們都恨你  曼達人
They all hate you, Mando.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,960
因為你是傳奇
Because you're a legend!

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,640
他們之中有多少人有追蹤器
How many of them had fobs?

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,560
他們都有
All of them.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,150
你知道他們會怎么做嗎
Any idea what they gonna happen to it?

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,600
我沒問  這違反公會規定
I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,270
索爾根
Sorgan.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,180
沒有星際港  沒有工業中心
No star port, no industrial centers,

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,230
人煙稀少
no population density.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,070
我要把他留在這里
I'm leaving him here.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,840
和我一起走  那孩子就過不上好日子了
Traveling with me, that's no life for a kid.

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,060
他們知道孩子在這里
They know he's here.

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,490
嗯
Yes.

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,130
他們不會罷休的
Then they'll keep coming.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,000
嗯
Yes.

16
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,500
把孩子交出來  曼達人
Hand over the child, Mando.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,500
我可能會留你條命
I might let you live.

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,770
抓穩了
Hold on.

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,520
挺住
Come on.

20
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,820
我把你帶回去就行  不論生死
I can bring you in warm or I can bring you in cold.

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,650
那是我的臺詞
That's my line.

22
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,820
燃料泄露
Losing fuel.

23
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,180
這里是莫斯艾斯利星際塔臺
This is Mos Eisley Tower.

24
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,260
我們正在跟蹤你
We are tracking you.

25
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,160
駛向35號泊位  完畢
Head for bay three-five, over.

26
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,210
收到
Copy that.

27
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,440
鎖定35泊位
Locked in for three-five.

28
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,710
你毀了我一個機器人  你得賠
You damage one of my droids, you'll pay for it.

29
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,670
讓它們不要靠近我的飛船
Just keep them away from my ship.

30
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,760
是嗎  你覺得這是個好主意嗎
Yeah? You think that's a good idea, do ya?

31
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,760
我們來看看你的飛船
Let's look at your ship.

32
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,080
你看看
Look at that.

33
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,990
上面有很多積碳呢
Ugh, you got a lot of carbon scorin' building up top.

34
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,920
是啊
Yeah.

35
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,140
乍一看我以為你跟別人交火過呢
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were in a shootout.

36
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,870
那個要特殊工具
Special tool for that one.

37
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,190
我得把這個轉一下
I am gonna have to rotate that.

38
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,660
燃料泄漏了
You got a fuel leak.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,410
瞧瞧  這也太慘了
Look at that, this is a mess.

40
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,170
你居然還能降落  你可得破費了
How did you even land? That's gonna set you back.

41
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,750
我有500帝國幣
I've got 500 Imperial Credits.

42
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,580
就這么多嗎  你們覺得呢
That's all you got? Well, what do you guys think?

43
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,070
起碼夠付機庫的錢了
That should at least cover the hangar.

44
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,640
我會想辦法籌錢的
I'll get you your money.

45
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,470
這話我聽過
I've heard that before.

46
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,120
-記住...  -知道
- Just remember... - Yeah.

47
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,510
不要機器人  我聽見了  不用說第二遍
No droids. I heard ya. You don't have to say it twice.

48
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,300
天啊
Jeez.

49
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,380
王鼠
Womp rat.

50
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,920
我跟
I'm in.

51
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,000
再加碼三根螺栓和一個激發器
And I am gonna raise you three bolts and a motivator.

52
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,020
快  把我的爆能步槍拿來
Quick, grab my blaster rifle.

53
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,700
你最好待在飛船里
I'd stay in that ship if I were you.

54
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,930
什么
What?

55
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,610
乖  乖
Now, now.

56
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,690
讓派麗好好看看你
Let Peli take a good look at you.

57
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,380
很好  這就對了
All right, there you go.

58
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
那個賞金獵人
Did that bounty hunter

59
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,620
把你一個人丟在又大又破的飛船上了
leave you all alone in that big nasty ship?

60
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,110
我怎么知道這是啥  別催
How do I know what it is? Give me a second.

61
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,750
你想吃東西嗎
All right. Now, would you like some food?

62
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,340
你餓嗎
Are you hungry?

63
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,260
給我們拿點吃的  快
Okay. Fetch us something to eat. Quick!

64
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,800
我也不知道...  帶骨頭的東西吧
I don't know... Something with bones in it.

65
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,810
好
Okay.

66
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,740
這樣吧
Now, here's the plan.

67
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,060
我會在曼達洛人回來之前照看你
I am going to look after you until The Mandalorian gets back,

68
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,440
然后我要加收照看你的錢
and then I'm gonna charge him extra for watching you.

69
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,010
明白了吧  亮眼睛
You see how that works? Yeah, bright eyes?

70
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,770
咱倆是一伙的
We're a team.

71
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,300
機器人
Hey, droid,

72
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,070
我是賞金獵人  想找活干
I'm a hunter. I'm lookin' for some work

73
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,020
很遺憾  塔圖因的賞金獵人公會關閉了
Unfortunately, the Bounty Guild no longer operates from Tatooine.

74
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,140
我不是找公會的活
I'm not looking for Guild work.

75
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,370
即便這樣  情況也差不多
I am afraid that does not improve your situation,

76
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,620
至少我的計算是這樣
at least by my calculation.

77
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,820
再想想  金屬殼
Think again, tin can.

78
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,260
如果你想找活就過來坐吧  朋友
If you're looking for work, have a seat, my friend.

79
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,270
我叫托洛  托洛·卡利肯
Name's Toro, Toro Calican.

80
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,890
來吧  別緊張
Come on, relax.

81
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,410
我離開中環時拿了這個賞金定位碟
Picked up this Bounty Puck before I left the Mid Rim.

82
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,780
芬尼克·尚德  一個殺手
Fennec Shand, an Assassin.

83
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,520
聽說新共和國把她的雇主們
Heard she's been on the run

84
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,780
關起來以后  她就一直在逃亡
ever since the New Republic put all her employers in lockdown.

85
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,490
我知道名字
I know the name.

86
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,310
我一直在盯著這個跟蹤器
I followed this tracking fob here.

87
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,750
位置數據顯示她跨越了沙丘海
Now the positional data suggests she's headed out beyond the Dune Sea.

88
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,020
這任務應該挺簡單的
Should be an easy job.

89
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,730
祝你好運
Well, good luck with that.

90
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,810
等等  等等  你不是在找活嗎
Wait, wait, wait, hey. I thought you needed work?

91
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,640
你在公會待多久了
How long you've been with the Guild?

92
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,800
夠久了
Long enough.

93
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,100
顯然不夠  芬尼克·尚德是一個精英雇傭兵
Clearly not. Fennec Shand is an elite mercenary.

94
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,600
她專為頂級犯罪集團殺人
She made her name killing for all the top crime syndicates,

95
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,360
包括赫特人
including the Hutts.

96
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,900
你要去找她  明天的太陽都見不到了
If you go after her, you won't make it past sunrise.

97
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,680
這是我的第一個任務
This is my first job.

98
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,140
所有的錢都歸你
You can keep the money, all of it.

99
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,560
我需要這個任務進入公會
I just need this job to get into the Guild.

100
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,960
我一個人干不了
I can't do it alone.

101
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,650
半小時后在35機庫等我
Meet me at Hangar three-five in half an hour.

102
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,100
帶上兩輛飛行摩托  把追蹤器給我
Bring two speeder bikes and give me the tracking fob.

103
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,230
別擔心  都記下來了
Don't worry, got it all memorized.

104
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,520
半小時
Half an hour.

105
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,270
看來你得跟我混了  搭檔
Looks like you're stuck with me now, partner.

106
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,740
我醒了  我醒了
I'm awake! I'm awake!

107
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,600
-他在哪里  -安靜
- Where is he? - Quiet!

108
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,880
沒事了  你把它吵醒了
It's okay. You woke it up.

109
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,920
你知道我花了多久才把它哄睡著嗎
Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?

110
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,830
給我
Give him to me.

111
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,420
別急
Not so fast!

112
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,860
你不能就這樣把孩子一個人留下
You can't just leave a child all alone like that.

113
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,450
你有很多東西要學  比如帶孩子
You know, you have an awful lot to learn about raisin' a young one.

114
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,420
總之我修理了漏油的地方
Anyway, I started the repair on the fuel leak.

115
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,000
好了  我有幾個問題想和你談談
There you go. I had a couple setbacks I want to talk to you about.

116
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,640
我按你的要求  沒有使用機器人
You know, I didn't use any droids, as requested,

117
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,010
所以花的時間比我的預期要長很多
so it took me a lot longer than I expected.

118
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,110
但我覺得你應該付得起錢
But I figured you were good for the money

119
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
畢竟你還有一個孩子要養
since you have an extra mouth to feed.

120
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,730
謝謝
Thank you.

121
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,900
看來我猜對了  你找到工作了  是嗎
Oh, I guess I was right. You got a job, didn't you?

122
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,270
光是給這些機器人充電
You know, it's costing me a lot of money

123
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,700
就花了我很多錢
to keep these droids even powered up.

124
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,560
曼多人  怎么樣  還不錯吧
Hey, Mando, what do you think? Not too shabby, huh?

125
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,130
想啥呢  這里又不是科雷利亞  夫人
What'd you expect? This ain't Corellia. Ma'am.

126
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,370
-怎么了  -看前面
- What's going on? - Look. Up ahead.

127
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,320
塔斯肯襲擊者
Tusken Raiders.

128
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,900
我聽本地人談論了這個骯臟的東西
I heard the locals talking about this filth.

129
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,180
塔斯肯人認為他們才是本地人
Tuskens think they're the locals.

130
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,700
其他人都是非法闖入
Everyone else is just trespassing.

131
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,520
不管他們怎么稱呼自己  最好離我們遠點
Whatever they call themselves, they best keep their distance.

132
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,860
是嗎  那你自己說吧
Yeah? Why don't you tell them yourself?

133
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,290
放松
Relax.

134
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,440
-你干嘛  -談判
- What are you doing? - Negotiating.

135
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,830
怎么回事
What's going on?

136
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,970
我們要通過他們的土地
We need passage across their land.

137
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,490
-把雙筒望遠鏡給我  -為什么
- Let me see the binocs. - Why?

138
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,240
什么
What?

139
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,000
-那可是全新的  -是嗎  現在不是了
- Those were brand new. - Yeah? They were.

140
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,280
隱蔽
Get down.

141
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,280
什么
What?

142
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,040
告訴我  你看到了什么
All right, tell me what you see.

143
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,710
沙地獸
Dewback.

144
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,720
騎手還在上面
Looks like the rider is still attached.

145
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,600
是她嗎  那是目標嗎
Is that her? Is that the target?

146
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,900
我不知道
I don't know.

147
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,970
我過去  你掩護我
I'll go. You cover me.

148
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
保持隱蔽
Stay down.

149
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,030
是她嗎  她死了嗎
Well, is it her? Is she dead?

150
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,770
也是一個賞金獵人
It's another bounty hunter.

151
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,120
別全貪了啊
Hey, I hope you don't plan on keeping all that stuff for yourself.

152
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,360
好歹給我留個爆能槍
Can I at least have that blaster?

153
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,560
趴下
Get down!

154
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,250
曼多人
Mando!

155
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,870
怎么回事
What happened?

156
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,180
狙擊螺栓
Sniper bolt.

157
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
只有MK改裝步槍才能打出來
Only an MK-modified rifle could make that shot.

158
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,840
你沒事吧
Are you all right?

159
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,690
嗯  打中我的貝斯卡鋼甲了
Yeah. Hit me in the beskar,

160
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,580
這個距離  貝斯卡鋼甲能抗住
and at that range beskar held up.

161
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,150
等等  我沒穿貝斯卡鋼甲
Wait, I don't wear any beskar.

162
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,890
的確
Nope.

163
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,070
那我們該怎么辦
Well, so what do we do?

164
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,150
你看到那槍是從哪里打來的嗎
You see where that shot came from?

165
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,440
嗯  從山脊那打過來的
Yeah, it came from that ridge.

166
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,890
好  我們等到天黑
Okay, we're gonna wait until dark.

167
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,780
如果她跑了呢
Well, what if she escapes?

168
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,160
現在是她占領高地
She's got the high ground.

169
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,220
她會等我們采取行動的
She'll wait for us to make the first move.

170
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,730
我休息一會  你先守著  注意隱蔽
I'm gonna rest. You take the first watch. Stay low!

171
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,470
太陽下山了  該走了  曼多人
All right, suns are down. Time to ride, Mando.

172
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,000
快點  醒醒
Come on, wake up.

173
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,210
看看你  在工作中睡著了  老頭子
Look at you, asleep on the job, old man.

174
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,670
說完了嗎
You done?

175
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,270
嗯  我就是來叫你的  走吧
Yeah. I was just, you know, waking you up. Come on.

176
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,940
騎上摩托
Get on your bike.

177
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,970
盡快沖向那些巖石
Ride as fast as you can towards those rocks.

178
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,220
這就是你的計劃  她會把我們從摩托上狙下來的
That's your plan? She'll snipe us right off the bikes.

179
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,800
這是閃擊電荷
It's a flash charge.

180
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,680
我們交替射擊  就可以短暫致盲所有角度
We alternate shots, it'll blind any scope temporarily.

181
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,460
再加上我們的速度  就有機會了
Combine that with our speed and we got a chance.

182
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,870
機會
A chance?

183
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,330
這次行動是你的主意  準備
Hey, you wanted this. Get ready.

184
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,730
開始
Now!

185
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,040
別急  芬尼克
Not so fast, Fennec.

186
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,720
注意力分散得不錯
Nice distraction.

187
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,790
是啊  干得漂亮  搭檔
Yeah, good work, partner.

188
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,970
自己銬上
Cuff yourself.

189
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,670
去找你的爆能槍吧
Why don't you go find your blaster?

190
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,800
曼達洛人
A Mandalorian.

191
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,840
我很久沒見過你這種人了
It's been a long time since I've seen one of your kind.

192
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,100
去過尼瓦羅嗎
Ever been to Nevarro?

193
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,420
我聽說那里的狀況不太好
I hear things didn't go so well there,

194
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,470
但是看起來你輕易就脫身了
but it looks like you got off easy.

195
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,940
我們把你上交后  你就不用想著去尼瓦羅
You don't have to worry about gettin' to Nevarro,

196
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,110
或者其他地方了
or anywhere else, once we turn you in.

197
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,010
我真的應該謝謝你
You know, I really should thank you.

198
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,900
你是我進入公會的入場券
You're my ticket into the Guild.

199
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,030
不客氣
You're welcome.

200
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,190
看來有個人要步行了
Looks like one of us has to walk.

201
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,650
我們也可以拖著你
Or we could drag you.

202
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,200
你有什么打算
All right, so what is the plan?

203
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,010
你去找我們看到的沙地獸
I need you to go find that dewback we saw.

204
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,970
然后把你和我的賞金還有摩托留在這里嗎
And leave you here with my bounty and my ride?

205
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,360
你想多了  曼達人
Yeah, I don't think so, Mando.

206
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,430
好吧  我去
Okay, I'll do it.

207
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,940
看著她  別讓她靠近摩托
Watch her, and don't let her get near the bike.

208
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,520
她死了對我們沒好處
She's no good to us dead.

209
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,840
好久沒睡這么好了
Oh, it's been a while.

210
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,920
瞧  太陽快出來了
Oh, look, the suns are coming up.

211
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,940
安靜
Quiet.

212
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,000
我還有時間趕去莫斯埃斯帕
Look, there's still time to make my rendezvous in Mos Espa.

213
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,560
載我過去  我可以付你雙倍的價錢
Take me to it and I can pay you double the price on my head.

214
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,140
我不在乎錢
I don't care about the money.

215
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,330
所以錢都歸曼達洛人咯
Oh, so the Mandalorian keeps all the money for himself.

216
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,720
那是我送他的
Only because I let him.

217
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,820
感覺不是呢
Doesn't seem that way.

218
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,760
我感覺都是他說了算
I mean, it seems like he's calling all the shots.

219
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,100
你知道啥
Shows what you know.

220
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,730
曼多人是我雇的  這是我的任務
I hired Mando, this is my job.

221
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,410
把你交上去  我就能正式加入賞金獵人公會
Bringin' you in will make me a full member of the Bounty Hunters Guild.

222
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,360
你已經擁有公會更看重的東西了
You already have something the Guild values far more than me.

223
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,730
你只是沒發現而已
You just don't see it.

224
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,220
-什么  -曼達洛人
- What? - The Mandalorian.

225
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,460
光是他的盔甲就比我的賞金值錢
His armor alone's worth more than my bounty.

226
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,400
我說了  我不在乎錢
I already told you, I don't care about the money.

227
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,170
那你應該在乎名聲吧
Then think what it would do for your reputation.

228
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,150
一個曼達洛人在尼瓦羅向公會開槍
A Mandalorian shot up the Guild on Nevarro,

229
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,860
搶走重要目標以后逃跑了
took some high value target and went rogue.

230
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,480
那個曼達洛人
That Mandalorian?

231
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,400
我說了  曼達洛人可不常見
Like I said, you don't see many.

232
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,820
你把那個叛徒上交公會
You bring the Guild that traitor,

233
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,490
他們肯定會熱烈歡迎你加入的
and they'll welcome you with open arms.

234
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,480
你的名字將會成為傳奇
Your name will be legendary.

235
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,970
我們怎么能確定是他
How can we be sure he's the one?

236
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,790
據說目標還在他身邊
Word is, he still has the target with him.

237
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,420
而且是個孩子
Some say it's a child.

238
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,280
如果你害怕和他戰斗  不用擔心
Look, if you're afraid to take him on, fear not.

239
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,130
我可以幫你
I can help you with that.

240
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,410
聽取我的建議  孩子
Take some advice, kid.

241
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,780
你想成為賞金獵人嗎
You wanna be a bounty hunter?

242
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,980
做對自己最有利的買賣  然后活下來
Make the best deal for yourself and survive.

243
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,460
這是個好建議
That's good advice,

244
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,480
但是如果我幫你解鎖  我就死定了
but if I took those binders off of you I'd be a dead man.

245
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,840
既然曼達洛人比你值錢  那
And if the Mandalorian's worth more than you are, well...

246
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,430
誰不想成為傳奇呢
Who wouldn't want to be a legend?

247
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,430
謝謝你的提醒
Thanks for the tip.

248
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,010
這么久啊  曼多人
Took you long enough, Mando.

249
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,580
看來現在我說了算啊  搭檔
Looks like I'm calling the shots now. Huh, partner?

250
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,590
放下爆能槍  把手舉起來
Drop your blaster and raise 'em.

251
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,130
把他銬起來
Cuff him.

252
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,240
你是公會的叛徒  曼多人
You're a Guild traitor, Mando.

253
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,440
我敢打賭
And I'm willing to bet that

254
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,240
這就是你協助逃跑的目標
this here is the target you helped escape.

255
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,920
你沒有看上去那么笨
You're smarter than you look.

256
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,440
芬尼克說得對
Fennec was right.

257
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,440
把你上交不但會讓我成為公會的一員
Bringing you in won't just make me a member of the Guild,

258
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,800
還會讓我成為傳奇
it'll make me legendary.

259
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,940
-退后  -一定要救它
- Stay back. - Gotta get it.

260
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,600
哪去了
Where is it?

261
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,190
你在這里呀
There you are.

262
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,950
你在躲我們嗎
Are you hiding from us?

263
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,020
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

264
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,640
沒關系  我知道
That's all right. I know.

265
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,770
你耳朵這么大  一定很吵吧
That was really loud for your big old ears, wasn't it?

266
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,820
沒事了
It's okay.

267
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,900
好好照顧他
Be careful with him.

268
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,200
你沒拿到報酬吧
So, I take it you didn't get paid?

269
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,730
夠了嗎
That cover me?

270
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,800
嗯嗯  夠了
Yeah. Yes, this is gonna cover you.

271
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,500
維修機器人  把這個拖出去
All right, Pit Droids! Let's drag this outta here!

272
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,010
我不知道  拖到拜加峽谷吧
I don't know, drag it to Beggar's Canyon.

273
