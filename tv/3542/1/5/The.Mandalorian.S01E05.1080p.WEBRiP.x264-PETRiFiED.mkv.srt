1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,320
他们都恨你  曼达人
They all hate you, Mando.

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,960
因为你是传奇
Because you're a legend!

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,640
他们之中有多少人有追踪器
How many of them had fobs?

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,560
他们都有
All of them.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,150
你知道他们会怎么做吗
Any idea what they gonna happen to it?

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,600
我没问  这违反公会规定
I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,820
《曼达洛人》前情提要

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,270
索尔根
Sorgan.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,180
没有星际港  没有工业中心
No star port, no industrial centers,

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,230
人烟稀少
no population density.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,070
我要把他留在这里
I'm leaving him here.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,840
和我一起走  那孩子就过不上好日子了
Traveling with me, that's no life for a kid.

13
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,060
他们知道孩子在这里
They know he's here.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,490
嗯
Yes.

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,130
他们不会罢休的
Then they'll keep coming.

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,000
嗯
Yes.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:10,040
星球大战

18
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,500
把孩子交出来  曼达人
Hand over the child, Mando.

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,500
我可能会留你条命
I might let you live.

20
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,770
抓稳了
Hold on.

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,520
挺住
Come on.

22
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,820
我把你带回去就行  不论生死
I can bring you in warm or I can bring you in cold.

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,650
那是我的台词
That's my line.

24
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,170
曼达洛人

25
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,420
第一季  第五集
持枪歹徒

26
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,820
燃料泄露
Losing fuel.

27
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,180
这里是莫斯艾斯利星际塔台
This is Mos Eisley Tower.

28
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,260
我们正在跟踪你
We are tracking you.

29
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,160
驶向35号泊位  完毕
Head for bay three-five, over.

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,210
收到
Copy that.

31
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,440
锁定35泊位
Locked in for three-five.

32
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,710
你毁了我一个机器人  你得赔
You damage one of my droids, you'll pay for it.

33
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,670
让它们不要靠近我的飞船
Just keep them away from my ship.

34
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,760
是吗  你觉得这是个好主意吗
Yeah? You think that's a good idea, do ya?

35
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,760
我们来看看你的飞船
Let's look at your ship.

36
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,080
你看看
Look at that.

37
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,990
上面有很多积碳呢
Ugh, you got a lot of carbon scorin' building up top.

38
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,920
是啊
Yeah.

39
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,140
乍一看我以为你跟别人交火过呢
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were in a shootout.

40
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,870
那个要特殊工具
Special tool for that one.

41
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,190
我得把这个转一下
I am gonna have to rotate that.

42
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,660
燃料泄漏了
You got a fuel leak.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,410
瞧瞧  这也太惨了
Look at that, this is a mess.

44
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,170
你居然还能降落  你可得破费了
How did you even land? That's gonna set you back.

45
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,750
我有500帝国币
I've got 500 Imperial Credits.

46
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,580
就这么多吗  你们觉得呢
That's all you got? Well, what do you guys think?

47
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,070
起码够付机库的钱了
That should at least cover the hangar.

48
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,640
我会想办法筹钱的
I'll get you your money.

49
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,470
这话我听过
I've heard that before.

50
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,120
-记住...  -知道
- Just remember... - Yeah.

51
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,510
不要机器人  我听见了  不用说第二遍
No droids. I heard ya. You don't have to say it twice.

52
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,300
天啊
Jeez.

53
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,380
王鼠
Womp rat.

54
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,920
我跟
I'm in.

55
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,000
再加码三根螺栓和一个激发器
And I am gonna raise you three bolts and a motivator.

56
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,020
快  把我的爆能步枪拿来
Quick, grab my blaster rifle.

57
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
你最好待在飞船里
I'd stay in that ship if I were you.

58
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:47,930
什么
What?

59
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,610
乖  乖
Now, now.

60
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,690
让派丽好好看看你
Let Peli take a good look at you.

61
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,380
很好  这就对了
All right, there you go.

62
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,840
那个赏金猎人
Did that bounty hunter

63
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,620
把你一个人丢在又大又破的飞船上了
leave you all alone in that big nasty ship?

64
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,110
我怎么知道这是啥  别催
How do I know what it is? Give me a second.

65
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,750
你想吃东西吗
All right. Now, would you like some food?

66
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,340
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

67
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,260
给我们拿点吃的  快
Okay. Fetch us something to eat. Quick!

68
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,800
我也不知道...  带骨头的东西吧
I don't know... Something with bones in it.

69
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,810
好
Okay.

70
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,740
这样吧
Now, here's the plan.

71
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,060
我会在曼达洛人回来之前照看你
I am going to look after you until The Mandalorian gets back,

72
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,440
然后我要加收照看你的钱
and then I'm gonna charge him extra for watching you.

73
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,010
明白了吧  亮眼睛
You see how that works? Yeah, bright eyes?

74
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,770
咱俩是一伙的
We're a team.

75
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,300
机器人
Hey, droid,

76
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,070
我是赏金猎人  想找活干
I'm a hunter. I'm lookin' for some work

77
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,020
很遗憾  塔图因的赏金猎人公会关闭了
Unfortunately, the Bounty Guild no longer operates from Tatooine.

78
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,140
我不是找公会的活
I'm not looking for Guild work.

79
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,370
即便这样  情况也差不多
I am afraid that does not improve your situation,

80
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,620
至少我的计算是这样
at least by my calculation.

81
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,820
再想想  金属壳
Think again, tin can.

82
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,260
如果你想找活就过来坐吧  朋友
If you're looking for work, have a seat, my friend.

83
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,270
我叫托洛  托洛·卡利肯
Name's Toro, Toro Calican.

84
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,890
来吧  别紧张
Come on, relax.

85
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,410
我离开中环时拿了这个赏金定位碟
Picked up this Bounty Puck before I left the Mid Rim.

86
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,780
芬尼克·尚德  一个杀手
Fennec Shand, an Assassin.

87
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,520
听说新共和国把她的雇主们
Heard she's been on the run

88
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,780
关起来以后  她就一直在逃亡
ever since the New Republic put all her employers in lockdown.

89
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,490
我知道名字
I know the name.

90
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,310
我一直在盯着这个跟踪器
I followed this tracking fob here.

91
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,750
位置数据显示她跨越了沙丘海
Now the positional data suggests she's headed out beyond the Dune Sea.

92
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,020
这任务应该挺简单的
Should be an easy job.

93
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,730
祝你好运
Well, good luck with that.

94
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,810
等等  等等  你不是在找活吗
Wait, wait, wait, hey. I thought you needed work?

95
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,640
你在公会待多久了
How long you've been with the Guild?

96
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,800
够久了
Long enough.

97
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,100
显然不够  芬尼克·尚德是一个精英雇佣兵
Clearly not. Fennec Shand is an elite mercenary.

98
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,600
她专为顶级犯罪集团杀人
She made her name killing for all the top crime syndicates,

99
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,360
包括赫特人
including the Hutts.

100
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,900
你要去找她  明天的太阳都见不到了
If you go after her, you won't make it past sunrise.

101
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,680
这是我的第一个任务
This is my first job.

102
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,140
所有的钱都归你
You can keep the money, all of it.

103
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,560
我需要这个任务进入公会
I just need this job to get into the Guild.

104
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,960
我一个人干不了
I can't do it alone.

105
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,650
半小时后在35机库等我
Meet me at Hangar three-five in half an hour.

106
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,100
带上两辆飞行摩托  把追踪器给我
Bring two speeder bikes and give me the tracking fob.

107
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,230
别担心  都记下来了
Don't worry, got it all memorized.

108
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,520
半小时
Half an hour.

109
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,270
看来你得跟我混了  搭档
Looks like you're stuck with me now, partner.

110
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,740
我醒了  我醒了
I'm awake! I'm awake!

111
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,600
-他在哪里  -安静
- Where is he? - Quiet!

112
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,880
没事了  你把它吵醒了
It's okay. You woke it up.

113
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,920
你知道我花了多久才把它哄睡着吗
Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?

114
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,830
给我
Give him to me.

115
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,420
别急
Not so fast!

116
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,860
你不能就这样把孩子一个人留下
You can't just leave a child all alone like that.

117
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,450
你有很多东西要学  比如带孩子
You know, you have an awful lot to learn about raisin' a young one.

118
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,420
总之我修理了漏油的地方
Anyway, I started the repair on the fuel leak.

119
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,000
好了  我有几个问题想和你谈谈
There you go. I had a couple setbacks I want to talk to you about.

120
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,640
我按你的要求  没有使用机器人
You know, I didn't use any droids, as requested,

121
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,010
所以花的时间比我的预期要长很多
so it took me a lot longer than I expected.

122
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,110
但我觉得你应该付得起钱
But I figured you were good for the money

123
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,680
毕竟你还有一个孩子要养
since you have an extra mouth to feed.

124
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,730
谢谢
Thank you.

125
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,900
看来我猜对了  你找到工作了  是吗
Oh, I guess I was right. You got a job, didn't you?

126
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,270
光是给这些机器人充电
You know, it's costing me a lot of money

127
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,700
就花了我很多钱
to keep these droids even powered up.

128
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,560
曼多人  怎么样  还不错吧
Hey, Mando, what do you think? Not too shabby, huh?

129
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,130
想啥呢  这里又不是科雷利亚  夫人
What'd you expect? This ain't Corellia. Ma'am.

130
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,370
-怎么了  -看前面
- What's going on? - Look. Up ahead.

131
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,320
塔斯肯袭击者
Tusken Raiders.

132
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,900
我听本地人谈论了这个肮脏的东西
I heard the locals talking about this filth.

133
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,180
塔斯肯人认为他们才是本地人
Tuskens think they're the locals.

134
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,700
其他人都是非法闯入
Everyone else is just trespassing.

135
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,520
不管他们怎么称呼自己  最好离我们远点
Whatever they call themselves, they best keep their distance.

136
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,860
是吗  那你自己说吧
Yeah? Why don't you tell them yourself?

137
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,290
放松
Relax.

138
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,440
-你干嘛  -谈判
- What are you doing? - Negotiating.

139
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,830
怎么回事
What's going on?

140
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,970
我们要通过他们的土地
We need passage across their land.

141
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,490
-把双筒望远镜给我  -为什么
- Let me see the binocs. - Why?

142
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,240
什么
What?

143
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,000
-那可是全新的  -是吗  现在不是了
- Those were brand new. - Yeah? They were.

144
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,280
隐蔽
Get down.

145
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,280
什么
What?

146
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,040
告诉我  你看到了什么
All right, tell me what you see.

147
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,710
沙地兽
Dewback.

148
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,720
骑手还在上面
Looks like the rider is still attached.

149
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,600
是她吗  那是目标吗
Is that her? Is that the target?

150
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,900
我不知道
I don't know.

151
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,970
我过去  你掩护我
I'll go. You cover me.

152
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,320
保持隐蔽
Stay down.

153
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,030
是她吗  她死了吗
Well, is it her? Is she dead?

154
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,770
也是一个赏金猎人
It's another bounty hunter.

155
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,120
别全贪了啊
Hey, I hope you don't plan on keeping all that stuff for yourself.

156
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,360
好歹给我留个爆能枪
Can I at least have that blaster?

157
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,560
趴下
Get down!

158
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,250
曼多人
Mando!

159
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,870
怎么回事
What happened?

160
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,180
狙击螺栓
Sniper bolt.

161
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,120
只有MK改装步枪才能打出来
Only an MK-modified rifle could make that shot.

162
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,840
你没事吧
Are you all right?

163
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,690
嗯  打中我的贝斯卡钢甲了
Yeah. Hit me in the beskar,

164
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,580
这个距离  贝斯卡钢甲能抗住
and at that range beskar held up.

165
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,150
等等  我没穿贝斯卡钢甲
Wait, I don't wear any beskar.

166
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,890
的确
Nope.

167
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,070
那我们该怎么办
Well, so what do we do?

168
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,150
你看到那枪是从哪里打来的吗
You see where that shot came from?

169
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,440
嗯  从山脊那打过来的
Yeah, it came from that ridge.

170
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,890
好  我们等到天黑
Okay, we're gonna wait until dark.

171
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,780
如果她跑了呢
Well, what if she escapes?

172
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,160
现在是她占领高地
She's got the high ground.

173
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,220
她会等我们采取行动的
She'll wait for us to make the first move.

174
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,730
我休息一会  你先守着  注意隐蔽
I'm gonna rest. You take the first watch. Stay low!

175
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,470
太阳下山了  该走了  曼多人
All right, suns are down. Time to ride, Mando.

176
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,000
快点  醒醒
Come on, wake up.

177
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,210
看看你  在工作中睡着了  老头子
Look at you, asleep on the job, old man.

178
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,670
说完了吗
You done?

179
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,270
嗯  我就是来叫你的  走吧
Yeah. I was just, you know, waking you up. Come on.

180
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,940
骑上摩托
Get on your bike.

181
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,970
尽快冲向那些岩石
Ride as fast as you can towards those rocks.

182
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,220
这就是你的计划  她会把我们从摩托上狙下来的
That's your plan? She'll snipe us right off the bikes.

183
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,800
这是闪击电荷
It's a flash charge.

184
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,680
我们交替射击  就可以短暂致盲所有角度
We alternate shots, it'll blind any scope temporarily.

185
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,460
再加上我们的速度  就有机会了
Combine that with our speed and we got a chance.

186
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,870
机会
A chance?

187
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,330
这次行动是你的主意  准备
Hey, you wanted this. Get ready.

188
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,730
开始
Now!

189
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,040
别急  芬尼克
Not so fast, Fennec.

190
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,720
注意力分散得不错
Nice distraction.

191
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,790
是啊  干得漂亮  搭档
Yeah, good work, partner.

192
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,970
自己铐上
Cuff yourself.

193
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,670
去找你的爆能枪吧
Why don't you go find your blaster?

194
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,800
曼达洛人
A Mandalorian.

195
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,840
我很久没见过你这种人了
It's been a long time since I've seen one of your kind.

196
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,100
去过尼瓦罗吗
Ever been to Nevarro?

197
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,420
我听说那里的状况不太好
I hear things didn't go so well there,

198
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,470
但是看起来你轻易就脱身了
but it looks like you got off easy.

199
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,940
我们把你上交后  你就不用想着去尼瓦罗
You don't have to worry about gettin' to Nevarro,

200
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,110
或者其他地方了
or anywhere else, once we turn you in.

201
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,010
我真的应该谢谢你
You know, I really should thank you.

202
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,900
你是我进入公会的入场券
You're my ticket into the Guild.

203
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,030
不客气
You're welcome.

204
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,190
看来有个人要步行了
Looks like one of us has to walk.

205
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,650
我们也可以拖着你
Or we could drag you.

206
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,200
你有什么打算
All right, so what is the plan?

207
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,010
你去找我们看到的沙地兽
I need you to go find that dewback we saw.

208
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,970
然后把你和我的赏金还有摩托留在这里吗
And leave you here with my bounty and my ride?

209
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,360
你想多了  曼达人
Yeah, I don't think so, Mando.

210
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,430
好吧  我去
Okay, I'll do it.

211
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,940
看着她  别让她靠近摩托
Watch her, and don't let her get near the bike.

212
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,520
她死了对我们没好处
She's no good to us dead.

213
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,840
好久没睡这么好了
Oh, it's been a while.

214
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,920
瞧  太阳快出来了
Oh, look, the suns are coming up.

215
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,940
安静
Quiet.

216
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,000
我还有时间赶去莫斯埃斯帕
Look, there's still time to make my rendezvous in Mos Espa.

217
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,560
载我过去  我可以付你双倍的价钱
Take me to it and I can pay you double the price on my head.

218
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,140
我不在乎钱
I don't care about the money.

219
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,330
所以钱都归曼达洛人咯
Oh, so the Mandalorian keeps all the money for himself.

220
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,720
那是我送他的
Only because I let him.

221
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,820
感觉不是呢
Doesn't seem that way.

222
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,760
我感觉都是他说了算
I mean, it seems like he's calling all the shots.

223
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,100
你知道啥
Shows what you know.

224
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,730
曼多人是我雇的  这是我的任务
I hired Mando, this is my job.

225
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,410
把你交上去  我就能正式加入赏金猎人公会
Bringin' you in will make me a full member of the Bounty Hunters Guild.

226
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,360
你已经拥有公会更看重的东西了
You already have something the Guild values far more than me.

227
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,730
你只是没发现而已
You just don't see it.

228
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,220
-什么  -曼达洛人
- What? - The Mandalorian.

229
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,460
光是他的盔甲就比我的赏金值钱
His armor alone's worth more than my bounty.

230
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,400
我说了  我不在乎钱
I already told you, I don't care about the money.

231
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,170
那你应该在乎名声吧
Then think what it would do for your reputation.

232
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,150
一个曼达洛人在尼瓦罗向公会开枪
A Mandalorian shot up the Guild on Nevarro,

233
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,860
抢走重要目标以后逃跑了
took some high value target and went rogue.

234
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,480
那个曼达洛人
That Mandalorian?

235
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,400
我说了  曼达洛人可不常见
Like I said, you don't see many.

236
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,820
你把那个叛徒上交公会
You bring the Guild that traitor,

237
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,490
他们肯定会热烈欢迎你加入的
and they'll welcome you with open arms.

238
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,480
你的名字将会成为传奇
Your name will be legendary.

239
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,970
我们怎么能确定是他
How can we be sure he's the one?

240
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,790
据说目标还在他身边
Word is, he still has the target with him.

241
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,420
而且是个孩子
Some say it's a child.

242
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,280
如果你害怕和他战斗  不用担心
Look, if you're afraid to take him on, fear not.

243
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,130
我可以帮你
I can help you with that.

244
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,410
听取我的建议  孩子
Take some advice, kid.

245
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,780
你想成为赏金猎人吗
You wanna be a bounty hunter?

246
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,980
做对自己最有利的买卖  然后活下来
Make the best deal for yourself and survive.

247
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,460
这是个好建议
That's good advice,

248
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,480
但是如果我帮你解锁  我就死定了
but if I took those binders off of you I'd be a dead man.

249
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,840
既然曼达洛人比你值钱  那
And if the Mandalorian's worth more than you are, well...

250
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,430
谁不想成为传奇呢
Who wouldn't want to be a legend?

251
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,430
谢谢你的提醒
Thanks for the tip.

252
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,010
这么久啊  曼多人
Took you long enough, Mando.

253
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,580
看来现在我说了算啊  搭档
Looks like I'm calling the shots now. Huh, partner?

254
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,590
放下爆能枪  把手举起来
Drop your blaster and raise 'em.

255
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,130
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

256
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,240
你是公会的叛徒  曼多人
You're a Guild traitor, Mando.

257
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,440
我敢打赌
And I'm willing to bet that

258
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,240
这就是你协助逃跑的目标
this here is the target you helped escape.

259
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,920
你没有看上去那么笨
You're smarter than you look.

260
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,440
芬尼克说得对
Fennec was right.

261
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,440
把你上交不但会让我成为公会的一员
Bringing you in won't just make me a member of the Guild,

262
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,800
还会让我成为传奇
it'll make me legendary.

263
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,940
-退后  -一定要救它
- Stay back. - Gotta get it.

264
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,600
哪去了
Where is it?

265
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,190
你在这里呀
There you are.

266
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,950
你在躲我们吗
Are you hiding from us?

267
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,020
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

268
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,640
没关系  我知道
That's all right. I know.

269
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,770
你耳朵这么大  一定很吵吧
That was really loud for your big old ears, wasn't it?

270
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,820
没事了
It's okay.

271
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,900
好好照顾他
Be careful with him.

272
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,200
你没拿到报酬吧
So, I take it you didn't get paid?

273
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,730
够了吗
That cover me?

274
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,800
嗯嗯  够了
Yeah. Yes, this is gonna cover you.

275
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,500
维修机器人  把这个拖出去
All right, Pit Droids! Let's drag this outta here!

276
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,010
我不知道  拖到拜加峡谷吧
I don't know, drag it to Beggar's Canyon.
