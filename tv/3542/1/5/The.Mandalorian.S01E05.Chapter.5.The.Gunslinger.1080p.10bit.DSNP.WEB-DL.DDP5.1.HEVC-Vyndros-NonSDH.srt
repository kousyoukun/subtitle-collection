1
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,842
They all hate you, Mando.

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,128
Because you're a legend!

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,469
How many had fobs?

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,553
All of them.

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,258
What's gonna happen to it?

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,638
I didn't ask.
It's against the Guild Code.

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,355
Sorgan.

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,519
No star port, no industrial centers,

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,109
no population density.

10
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,279
I'm leaving him here.

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,533
Traveling with me,
that's no life for a kid.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,993
They know he's here.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,620
Yes.

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,047
Then they'll keep coming.

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,998
Yes.

16
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,418
Hand over the child, Mando.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,261
I might let you live.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,070
Hold on.

19
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,568
Come on.

20
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:04,463
I can bring you in warm
or I can bring you in cold.

21
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,471
That's my line.

22
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,621
Losing fuel.

23
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,211
This is Mos Eisley Tower.

24
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,293
We are tracking you.

25
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,387
Head for bay three-five, over.

26
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,752
Copy that.

27
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,459
Locked in for three-five.

28
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,429
Hey!

29
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,857
Hey!

30
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,527
You damage one of my droids,
you'll pay for it.

31
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,483
Just keep them away from my ship.

32
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,447
Yeah? You think that's a good idea, do ya?

33
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,445
Let's look at your ship.

34
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,612
Oof! Look at that.

35
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,988
Ugh, you got a lot of carbon scorin'
building up top.

36
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,373
Yeah.

37
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,081
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were in a shootout.

38
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,751
Special tool for that one.

39
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,838
I am gonna have to rotate that.

40
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,475
You got a fuel leak.

41
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,392
Look at that, this is a mess.

42
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,892
How did you even land?
That's gonna set you back.

43
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,559
I've got 500 Imperial Credits.

44
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,190
That's all you got?
Well, what do you guys think?

45
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,609
That should at least cover the hangar.

46
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,449
I'll get you your money.

47
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,325
Hmm. I've heard that before.

48
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,826
Just remember...

49
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,370
Yeah, no droids. I heard ya.
You don't have to say it twice.

50
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,467
Jeez.

51
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,467
Womp rat.

52
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,201
I'm in.

53
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,750
And I am gonna raise you three bolts
and a motivator.

54
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,806
Shh. Quick, grab my blaster rifle.

55
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,563
I'd stay in that ship if I were you.

56
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,744
What?

57
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,961
Now, now.

58
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,385
Let Peli take a good look at you.

59
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,347
All right, there you go.

60
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:13,389
Did that bounty hunter leave you all alone
in that big nasty ship?

61
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,772
How do I know what it is?
Give me a second.

62
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,524
All right. Now, would you like some food?

63
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,318
Are you hungry?

64
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,701
Okay. Fetch us something to eat. Quick!

65
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,531
I don't know...
Something with bones in it.

66
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,747
Okay.

67
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,698
Now, here's the plan.

68
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,919
I am going to look after you
until The Mandalorian gets back,

69
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:45,302
and then I'm gonna charge him extra
for watching you.

70
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,841
You see how that works? Yeah, bright eyes?

71
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,011
We're a team. Mmm-hmm.

72
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,877
Hey, droid, I'm a hunter.
I'm lookin' for some work

73
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,592
Unfortunately, the Bounty Guild
no longer operates from Tatooine.

74
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,476
I'm not looking for Guild work.

75
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,221
I am afraid
that does not improve your situation,

76
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,436
at least by my calculation.

77
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,890
Think again, tin can.

78
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,229
If you're looking for work,
have a seat, my friend.

79
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,071
Name's Toro, Toro Calican.

80
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,693
Come on, relax.

81
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,373
Picked up this Bounty Puck
before I left the Mid Rim.

82
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,753
Fennec Shand, an Assassin.

83
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,717
Heard she's been on the run

84
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,506
ever since the New Republic
put all her employers in lockdown.

85
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,259
I know the name.

86
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,761
I followed this tracking fob here.

87
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,512
Now the positional data suggests
she's headed out beyond the Dune Sea.

88
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,435
Should be an easy job.

89
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,638
Well, good luck with that.

90
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,691
Wait, wait, wait, hey.
I thought you needed work?

91
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,365
How long with the Guild?

92
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,613
Long enough.

93
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:33,905
Clearly not.
Fennec Shand is an elite mercenary.

94
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,409
She made her name
killing for all the top crime syndicates,

95
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,204
including the Hutts.

96
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,715
If you go after her,
you won't make it past sunrise.

97
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,213
This is my first job.

98
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,420
You can keep the money, all of it.

99
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,508
I just need this job
to get into the Guild.

100
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,178
I can't do it alone.

101
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,189
Meet me at
Hangar three-five in half an hour.

102
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:12,036
Bring two speeder bikes
and give me the tracking fob.

103
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,041
Don't worry, got it all memorized.

104
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,956
Half an hour.

105
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,502
Looks like
you're stuck with me now, partner.

106
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,035
- Hey!
- I'm awake! I'm awake!

107
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,152
Oh.

108
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,069
- Where is he?
- Quiet!

109
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,623
Oh. It's okay. You woke it up.

110
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,292
Do you have any idea
how long it took me to get it to sleep?

111
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,792
Give him to me.

112
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,123
Not so fast!

113
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,677
You can't just leave
a child all alone like that.

114
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,300
You know, you have an awful lot to learn
about raisin' a young one.

115
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,430
Anyway, I started the repair
on the fuel leak.

116
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,771
There you go. I had a couple setbacks
I want to talk to you about.

117
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,690
You know, I didn't use any droids,
as requested,

118
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,826
so it took me a lot longer
than I expected.

119
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,746
But I figured you were good for the money
since you have an extra mouth to feed.

120
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,626
Thank you.

121
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,709
Oh, I guess I was right.
You got a job, didn't you?

122
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:54,507
You know, it's costing me a lot of money
to keep these droids even powered up.

123
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,345
Hey, Mando, what do you think?
Not too shabby, huh?

124
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:12,483
What'd you expect?
This ain't Corellia. Ma'am.

125
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,334
- What's going on?
- Look. Up ahead.

126
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,237
Tusken Raiders.

127
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,485
I heard the locals
talking about this filth.

128
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,037
Tuskens think they're the locals.

129
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,402
Everyone else is just trespassing.

130
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,158
Whatever they call themselves,
they best keep their distance.

131
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,873
Yeah?
Why don't you tell them yourself?

132
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,756
Relax.

133
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,135
- What are you doing?
- Negotiating.

134
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,063
What's going on?

135
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,986
We need passage across their land.

136
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,616
- Let me see the binocs.
- Why?

137
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,699
Hey! What?

138
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,122
- Those were brand new.
- Yeah? They were.

139
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
Get down.

140
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,904
What? Oh.

141
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,416
All right, tell me what you see.

142
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:09,699
Dewback.

143
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,915
Looks like the rider is still attached.

144
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,501
Is that her? Is that the target?

145
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,291
I don't know.

146
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,835
I'll go. You cover me.

147
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,845
Stay down.

148
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,065
Whoa, whoa.

149
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,958
Well, is it her? Is she dead?

150
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,711
It's another bounty hunter.

151
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:03,135
Hey, I hope you don't plan
on keeping all that stuff for yourself.

152
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,383
Can I at least have that blaster?

153
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,468
Get down!

154
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,138
Mando!

155
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,482
What happened?

156
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,405
Sniper bolt.

157
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,069
Only an MK-modified rifle
could make that shot.

158
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:33,993
Are you all right?

159
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,579
Yeah. Hit me in the beskar,

160
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,580
and at that range beskar held up.

161
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,960
Wait, I don't wear any beskar.

162
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,586
Nope.

163
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Well, so what do we do?

164
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,266
You see where that shot came from?

165
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,550
Yeah, it came from that ridge.

166
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,855
Okay, we're gonna wait until dark.

167
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,640
Well, what if she escapes?

168
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,356
She's got the high ground.

169
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,106
She'll wait for us to make the first move.

170
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,650
I'm gonna rest.
You take the first watch. Stay low!

171
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,668
All right, suns are down.
Time to ride, Mando.

172
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,137
Come on, wake up.

173
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,180
Look at you, asleep on the job, old man.

174
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,537
You done?

175
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:58,081
Yeah. I was just, you know, waking you up.
Come on.

176
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,245
Get on your bike.

177
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,710
Ride as fast as you can
towards those rocks.

178
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,752
That's your plan?
She'll snipe us right off the bikes.

179
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,263
It's a flash charge.

180
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,687
We alternate shots,

181
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,431
it'll blind any scope temporarily.

182
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,010
Combine that with our speed
and we got a chance.

183
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,558
A chance?

184
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,983
Hey, you wanted this. Get ready.

185
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,011
Now!

186
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,057
Not so fast, Fennec.

187
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,804
Nice distraction.

188
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,905
Ow.

189
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,745
Yeah, good work, partner.

190
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,282
Cuff yourself.

191
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,368
Why don't you go find your blaster?

192
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,174
A Mandalorian.

193
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,800
It's been a long time
since I've seen one of your kind.

194
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,010
Ever been to Nevarro?

195
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,555
I hear things didn't go so well there,

196
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,389
but it looks like you got off easy.

197
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,145
You don't have to worry
about gettin' to Nevarro,

198
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,311
or anywhere else, once we turn you in.

199
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,939
You know, I really should thank you.

200
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,785
You're my ticket into the Guild.

201
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,241
You're welcome.

202
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,754
Uh-oh.
Looks like one of us has to walk.

203
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,249
Or we could drag you.

204
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,095
All right, so what is the plan?

205
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,763
I need you to go find that dewback we saw.

206
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,520
And leave you here with my bounty
and my ride?

207
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:51,892
Yeah, I don't think so, Mando.

208
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,698
Okay, I'll do it.

209
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,082
Watch her,
and don't let her get near the bike.

210
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,913
She's no good to us dead.

211
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,663
Oh, it's been a while.

212
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,703
Oh, look, the suns are coming up.

213
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,828
Quiet.

214
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,927
Look, there's still time
to make my rendezvous in Mos Espa.

215
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,215
Take me to it and I can pay you
double the price on my head.

216
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,176
I don't care about the money.

217
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,385
Oh, so the Mandalorian
keeps all the money for himself.

218
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,431
Only because I let him.

219
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:10,895
Doesn't seem that way.

220
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,814
I mean, it seems like
he's calling all the shots.

221
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,024
Shows what you know.

222
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,732
I hired Mando, this is my job.

223
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:21,195
Bringin' you in will make me a full member
of the Bounty Hunters Guild.

224
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,323
You already have something
the Guild values far more than me.

225
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,494
You just don't see it.

226
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,161
- What?
- The Mandalorian.

227
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,369
His armor alone's worth
more than my bounty.

228
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,199
I already told you,
I don't care about the money.

229
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,161
Then think what it would do
for your reputation.

230
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:43,216
A Mandalorian
shot up the Guild on Nevarro,

231
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,798
took some high value target
and went rogue.

232
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,476
That Mandalorian?

233
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,396
Like I said, you don't see many.

234
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:57,273
You bring the Guild that traitor,
and they'll welcome you with open arms.

235
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,106
Your name will be legendary.

236
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,159
How can we be sure he's the one?

237
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:18,465
Word is, he still has the target with him.

238
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,212
Some say it's a child.

239
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:26,925
Look, if you're afraid to take him on,
fear not. I can help you with that.

240
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,595
Take some advice, kid.

241
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,300
You wanna be a bounty hunter?

242
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:36,099
Make the best deal for yourself
and survive.

243
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,434
That's good advice,

244
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:22,485
but if I took those binders off of you
I'd be a dead man.

245
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:27,985
And if the Mandalorian's worth
more than you are, well...

246
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,244
Who wouldn't want to be a legend?

247
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,702
Thanks for the tip.

248
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,965
Took you long enough, Mando.

249
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,511
Looks like I'm calling the shots now.
Huh, partner?

250
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,310
Drop your blaster and raise 'em.

251
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,779
- Cuff him.
- Ugh.

252
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,203
You're a Guild traitor, Mando.

253
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:50,584
And I'm willing to bet that this here
is the target you helped escape.

254
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:54,092
You're smarter than you look.

255
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,094
Fennec was right.

256
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,550
Bringing you in won't just make me
a member of the Guild,

257
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,853
it'll make me legendary.

258
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,870
- Stay back.
- Gotta get it.

259
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,701
Where is it?

260
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,717
There you are.

261
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,630
Are you hiding from us? Huh?

262
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,687
Look at you.

263
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,473
That's all right. I know.

264
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,558
That was really loud
for your big old ears, wasn't it?

265
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,737
It's okay. Shh.

266
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,246
Be careful with him.

267
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,499
So, I take it you didn't get paid?

268
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,129
That cover me?

269
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,643
Yeah. Yes, this is gonna cover you.

270
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:34,273
All right, Pit Droids!
Let's drag this outta here!

271
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,535
I don't know, drag it to Beggar's Canyon.
