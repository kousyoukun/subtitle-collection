1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,963
The Empire is gone, Mando.

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:07,765
This asset was of
extreme importance to me.

3
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:11,092
I had to ensure its delivery.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,969
He's not a local warlord.

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,476
He's Imperial.

6
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:15,562
I'm in.

7
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:18,137
Our secrecy is our survival.

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,117
Our survival is our strength.

9
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:23,522
Our strength was once in our numbers.

10
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,156
Now, we live in the shadows.

11
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:28,487
Our world was shattered by the Empire.

12
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,659
You're going to have
to relocate the covert.

13
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,952
This is the Way.

14
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,492
In the wake of your
destruction, it was left behind.

15
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:42,370
Is it still a hunter?

16
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:44,875
No. But it will protect.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,507
You got a real thing
for droids, don't you?

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,672
I got a real thing for that droid.

19
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,216
Let me take the child to him...

20
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,469
Let's kill him and get out of here.

21
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,258
- We both need the client to be eliminated.
- He's right.

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,750
As long as the Imp lives, he'll
send hunters after the child.

23
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:58,830
It's a trap.

24
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,734
- Have they brought the child?
- Yes, they have.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,815
You have something I want.

26
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,653
Kuiil? Are you there?

27
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:12,823
In a few moments...

28
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:15,868
Kuiil! Are you there?

29
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:19,039
...it will be mine.

30
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,728
Speeder bikes have arrived at
the checkpoint with the asset.

31
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,314
Awaiting confirmation.

32
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,398
Knock it off!

33
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,851
Waiting for confirmation
to continue into town.

34
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,887
That's a go to proceed, but
I advise you to double-check.

35
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,742
The Moff just touched down and already

36
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,789
took out a squad of local troopers.

37
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,923
Standing by.

38
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,710
Did he just say that
Gideon killed his own men?

39
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,695
Oh, who knows?

40
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:56,210
These guys like to lay down the law
when they first arrive into town.

41
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:58,759
You know how it is.

42
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:02,023
I said, shut up. Yeesh.

43
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:03,727
What is that thing, anyway?

44
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,813
Uh, I don't know.

45
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:07,484
Maybe Moff wants to eat
it. I don't ask questions.

46
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:10,983
Can I see it?

47
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,743
Did you not just hear
that Moff Gideon killed

48
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:15,746
a dozen of his own
troopers to make a point.

49
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:18,132
- Okay.
- I get that point.

50
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:20,031
- Do you get the point?
- Yes, I get the point.

51
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,034
Okay.

52
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:49,294
Should we offer that thing some water?

53
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,756
You just wanna look at it.

54
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:52,216
So what? You got to see it!

55
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:53,148
Barely.

56
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,777
I mean, I grabbed it up off the
ground and I stuffed it in the sack.

57
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,653
It's more than I got to see it.

58
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,774
Look, I'm not taking it out of

59
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:02,046
this bag until I deliver it to the Moff.

60
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,593
- Fine.
- Okay. Stop asking.

61
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,292
Let me check on this
thing. This is crazy.

62
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,418
Any update yet?

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,070
That's a negative. Still
waiting on confirmation.

64
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:17,907
He just killed an officer
for interrupting him,

65
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,993
so this might take a while.

66
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:21,704
Thank you.

67
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:24,251
Standing by still. Unbelievable.

68
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:28,454
Hey, how long has it been
since that thing moved?

69
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:31,023
I don't know, like a
minute or two. Don't worry.

70
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,939
Uh, it's been way longer than a minute.

71
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,023
Oh, my God.

72
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,961
Shouldn't we check and
see if it's still alive?

73
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,226
You hit it pretty hard.

74
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,601
You just wanna see it.

75
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:41,396
We should check and see if it's hurt.

76
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:43,822
The last thing that you
want is to give Gideon a bag

77
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,430
and have him open it and
find whatever is dead...

78
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,421
Okay. Okay, look. Here you go. See?

79
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:50,342
Take a peek. Everything's fine.

80
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:51,636
What is that?

81
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,473
I don't know. It's a pet or something.

82
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:55,062
A pet? I thought you...

83
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:00,342
Serves you right.

84
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,594
Stop that.

85
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,628
Identify yourself!

86
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,125
I am IG-11.

87
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:08,333
I am this child's
nurse droid and require

88
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,383
that you remand him to me immediately.

89
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:11,976
A nurse droid?

90
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,855
I thought it was a hunter.
Aren't IGs usually hunters?

91
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,192
Yeah, well, evidently
this one's a nurse.

92
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm sorry, nurse, but you're
gonna have to get out of here.

93
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,176
Are you refusing my request?

94
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:25,407
No.

95
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,952
I'm telling you to get out of here.

96
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,426
Hey.

97
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,170
That was unpleasant.

98
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,789
I'm sorry you had to see that.

99
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:57,460

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,692
Is there another way out?

101
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,071
No, that's it.

102
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,240
- What about the sewers?
- Sewers?

103
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:25,700
The Mandalorians have a
covert down in the sewers.

104
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,036
If we can get down there,
they can help us escape.

105
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:29,538
Yeah, sewers are good.

106
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,289
Checking for access points.

107
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:36,255
What the hell are they waiting for?

108
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,561
Hold up.

109
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,153
They're setting up an E-Web.

110
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,109
It's over.

111
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,030
I found the sewer vent.

112
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,534
Let's get the hell out of here.

113
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,267
It's assembled! How long
until that thing's cleared?

114
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,875
- Blow it.
- I'm out of charges.

115
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:36,148
Get out of the way!

116
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,953
Your astute panic suggests

117
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:50,576
that you understand your situation.

118
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,206
I would prefer to avoid
any further violence,

119
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,294
and encourage a moment of consideration.

120
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:01,755
Members of my escort
have completed assembly

121
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:04,593
of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster.

122
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,911
If you are unfamiliar with this weapon,

123
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:11,890
I am sure that Republican Shock
Trooper Carasynthia Dune of Alderaan

124
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,890
will advise you that she has witnessed

125
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,311
many of her ranks vaporize mid-descent

126
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:20,901
facing the predecessor
of this particular model.

127
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:28,409
Or perhaps the decommissioned
Mandalorian hunter, Din Djarin,

128
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:33,035
has heard the songs of
the Siege of Mandalore,

129
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,164
when gunships outfitted
with similar ordnance

130
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,281
laid waste to fields
of Mandalorian recruits

131
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:42,375
in The Night of a Thousand Tears.

132
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:47,856
I advise disgraced
Magistrate Greef Karga

133
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,971
to search the wisdom of his years

134
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:56,476
and urge you to lay down
your arms and come outside.

135
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:59,980
The structure you are trapped
in will be razed in short order

136
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:04,319
and your storied lives will
come to an unceremonious end.

137
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,032
What do you propose?

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,159
Reasonable negotiation.

139
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:15,704
What assurance do you offer?

140
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:19,334
If you're asking if you
can trust me, you cannot.

141
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:23,461
Just as you betrayed
our business arrangement,

142
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:28,008
I would gladly break any promise
and watch you die at my hand.

143
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,220
The assurance I give is this: I
will act in my own self-interest,

144
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:36,393
which at this time involves
your cooperation and benefit.

145
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:42,331
I will give you until nightfall,

146
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,237
and then I will have the
E-Web cannon open fire.

147
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,370
I say we hear him out.

148
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:56,369
The minute we open
that door, we're dead.

149
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,038
We're dead if we don't.

150
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,915
At least out there, we've got a shot.

151
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,374
That's easy for you to say.

152
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,085
I'm a Rebel Shock Trooper.

153
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:04,920
They'll upload me to a Mind Flayer.

154
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,798
Those aren't real. That
was just wartime propaganda.

155
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,581
I don't care to find out. I'm
shooting my way out of here.

156
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,637
What about you, Mando?

157
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,999
I know who he is.

158
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:18,725
It's Moff Gideon.

159
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:19,851
No.

160
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,145
Moff Gideon was executed for war crimes.

161
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,648
It's him. He knew my name.

162
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,108
So? What does that prove?

163
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,111
I haven't heard that name
spoken since I was a child.

164
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:30,237
On Mandalore?

165
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:32,322
I was not born on Mandalore.

166
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:33,782
But you're a Mandalorian.

167
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,327
Mandalorian isn't a race.

168
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,455
It's a Creed.

169
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,407
I was a foundling.

170
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,534
They raised me in the Fighting Corps.

171
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:06,495
I was treated as one of their own.

172
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:09,414
When I came of age, I
was sworn to the Creed.

173
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,918
The only record of my family name
was in the registers of Mandalore.

174
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,507
Moff Gideon was an ISB
Officer during the purge.

175
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:18,895
That's how I know it's him.

176
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,731
That's how he knows who we all are.

177
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,881
He says he needs us,

178
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:24,028
which means the child got away safely.

179
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,431
I was worried when the
Ugnaught didn't respond,

180
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,770
but if they'd captured the
kid, we'd already be dead.

181
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,979
Hail them again.

182
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,055
Come in, Kuiil.

183
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:37,894
Kuiil?

184
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,904
- Nothing.
- They might have jammed the link.

185
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:48,539
Kuiil has been terminated.

186
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:51,164
What did you do?

187
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,166
I am fulfilling my base function.

188
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:54,376
Which is?

189
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,046
To nurse and protect.

190
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,886
What was that?

191
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:06,036
Look alive.

192
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,723
Look!

193
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,331
Cover me.

194
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:38,575
Burn them out.

195
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:45,107
Stay with me, buddy. We're
gonna get you out of here.

196
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,341
This is our only path
out. Can you clear it?

197
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:51,689
Stay with me.

198
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:55,117
If you go near this child, I
will no choice but to kill you.

199
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,286
I understand. Can you do
anything to move the grate?

200
00:18:58,288 --> 00:18:59,591
Yes, of course.

201
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:04,670
Oh, I love IG units.

202
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:07,295
I'm not gonna make it. Go.

203
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:11,133
Shut up. You just got your
bell rung. You'll be fine.

204
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:12,717
Leave me.

205
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,778
I'm gonna need to take this thing off.

206
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,433
No. You leave me.

207
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:22,855
You make sure the child is safe.

208
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:24,982
Here.

209
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:31,069
When you get to the Mandalorian
covert, you show them that.

210
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:34,448
You tell them it's from Din Djarin.

211
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,966
You tell them the foundling
was in my protection,

212
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,270
and they'll help you.

213
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:40,025
We can make it.

214
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:50,157
Come on! Let's go!

215
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
I'm not gonna make it and you know it.

216
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,319
You protect the child.

217
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:15,238
I can hold them back long
enough for you to escape.

218
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,157
Let me have a warrior's death.

219
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,869
I won't leave you.

220
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,152
This is the Way.

221
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,477
Come on! It's open, let's go!

222
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:26,101
Go. Go.

223
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,063
We have to move! Now!

224
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:31,525
Go.

225
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,235
Escape and protect this child.

226
00:21:35,237 --> 00:21:37,156
I will stay with the Mandalorian.

227
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,615
Promise me you'll bring him.

228
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:43,995
You have my word.

229
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:01,887
Do it.

230
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,188
Do what?

231
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,908
Just get it over with.

232
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:09,102
I'd rather you kill me than some Imp.

233
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:11,438
I told you. I am no longer a hunter.

234
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,108
I am a nurse droid.

235
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:16,860
IGs are all hunters.

236
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:19,946
Not this one. I was reprogrammed.

237
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:22,785
I need to remove your
helmet if I am to save you.

238
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:28,999
Try it and I'll kill you.

239
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:34,502
It is forbidden.

240
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:36,688
No living thing has
seen me without my helmet

241
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,274
since I swore the Creed.

242
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,846
I am not a living thing.

243
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:56,819
This is a bacta spray. It will
heal you in a matter of hours.

244
00:22:57,694 --> 00:23:00,697
You have suffered damage to
your central processing unit.

245
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,699
You mean my brain?

246
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:08,243
That was a joke. It is
meant to put you at ease.

247
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,983
I got you.

248
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,457
Do you know which way to go?

249
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:55,542
No. I don't know these tunnels.

250
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:57,254
I've only entered from the bazaar.

251
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,717
Well, if we get the smell
of sulfur and we follow it,

252
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:06,297
it'll lead us up to the
plains where the river flows.

253
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,181
And the Imps will catch us
before we make it to the ship.

254
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:12,144
We need the Mandalorians
to escort us to safety.

255
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,399
Ugh, this place is a maze.

256
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:21,653
Stop.

257
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:24,738
I can stand.

258
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,782
The bacta infusion is working.

259
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:28,452
I'll try to find tracks.

260
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,371
We're close.

261
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,727
Turn here.

262
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:31,471
We should go.

263
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:35,641
You go. Take the ship. I
can't leave it this way.

264
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:37,211
Did you know about this?

265
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,298
Is this the work of your bounty hunters?

266
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:40,383
No.

267
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:43,372
When you left the system and
took the prize, the fighting ended

268
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,235
and the hunters just melted away.

269
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:47,195
You know how it is.

270
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:49,326
They're mercenaries.
They're not zealots.

271
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:51,908
Did you do this? Did you?

272
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,996
- No!
- It was not his fault.

273
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:58,208
We revealed ourselves.

274
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:02,588
We knew what could happen
if we left the covert.

275
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:07,134
The Imperials arrived
shortly thereafter.

276
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:11,129
This is what resulted.

277
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:14,222
Did any survive?

278
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:18,149
I hope so. Some may
have escaped off-world.

279
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:22,977
Come with us.

280
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,479
No.

281
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:28,947
I will not abandon this place
until I have salvaged what remains.

282
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,943
Show me the one whose safety
deemed such destruction.

283
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:10,195
This is the one.

284
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:13,448
This is the one that
you hunted, then saved?

285
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,578
Yes. The one that saved me as well.

286
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:20,082
- From the mudhorn?
- Yes.

287
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,083
It looks helpless.

288
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,254
It's injured, but it is not helpless.

289
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:29,965
Its species can move
objects with its mind.

290
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,760
I know of such things.

291
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:38,807
The songs of eons past tell of
battles between Mandalore The Great,

292
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,728
and an order of sorcerers called
Jedi that fought with such powers.

293
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,355
It is an enemy?

294
00:27:45,357 --> 00:27:50,008
No. Its kind were enemies,
but this individual is not.

295
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,529
What is it?

296
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:54,368
It is a foundling.

297
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:59,535
By Creed, it is in your care.

298
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,415
You wish me to train this thing?

299
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,667
It is too weak. It would die.

300
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:09,407
You have no choice. You must
reunite it with its own kind.

301
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:11,247
Where?

302
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,960
This, you must determine.

303
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:15,927
You expect me to search the galaxy

304
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,095
for the home of this creature

305
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:19,600
and deliver it to a
race of enemy sorcerers?

306
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:22,785
This is the Way.

307
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,608
Hey.

308
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,569
These tunnels will be lousy
with Imps in a matter of minutes.

309
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:35,063
We should at least
discuss an escape plan.

310
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:37,074
If you follow the descending tunnel,

311
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:39,159
it will lead you to
the underground river.

312
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:41,649
It flows downstream
toward the lava flats.

313
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,331
I think we should go.

314
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,665
I'm staying.

315
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,667
I need to help her and I need to heal.

316
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:48,835
You must go.

317
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:51,546
A foundling is in your care.

318
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:56,968
By Creed, until it is of age
or reunited with its own kind,

319
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,680
you are as its father.

320
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,021
This is the Way.

321
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,401
You have earned your Signet.

322
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,383
You are a clan of two.

323
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:32,379
Thank you.

324
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:34,089
I will wear this with honor.

325
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,225
We should go.

326
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:47,769
IG, please guard the outer hallway.

327
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:49,606
A scouting party draws near.

328
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:54,233
Hang on. I don't do the baby thing.

329
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:58,991
I have one more gift for your journey.

330
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:02,450
Have you trained in the Rising Phoenix?

331
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:04,327
When I was a boy. Yes.

332
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:08,461
Then this will make you complete.

333
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:11,334
Thank you.

334
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:13,962
ARMORER When you have healed,
you will begin your drills.

335
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:16,506
Until you know it, it will
not listen to your commands.

336
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:18,258
I understand.

337
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:31,696
You are protected.

338
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:34,983
More will come. You must go.

339
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:36,485
Come with us.

340
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,320
My place is here.

341
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:39,899
Restock your munitions.

342
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:47,122
IG, carry this for Din Djarin
until he is well enough to wear it.

343
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:49,873
Now, go.

344
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,877
Down to the river and across the plains.

345
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,570
Be safe on your journey.

346
00:30:55,573 --> 00:30:56,653
Thank you.

347
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:28,305
Hey, Mando.

348
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:30,711
Where are they?

349
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:34,670
I said, where are they?

350
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,035
This is the lava river.

351
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,218
The ferry droid is fried.

352
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:17,310
Yeah, but if we push the boat out,

353
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:18,849
we can get it to float downstream.

354
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:19,935
Come on.

355
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,772
Looks old. Will it take the heat?

356
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,675
You got a better idea?

357
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:24,757
Guess not.

358
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:30,000
Push!

359
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,518
Come on! What're you doing?

360
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,891
- Let's try this.
- Push!

361
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:41,234
You guys mind getting out of the way?

362
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:42,383
Oh!

363
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:48,977
Good job.

364
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:54,664
Watch your feet. It's molten lava.

365
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,918
No kidding.

366
00:33:14,937 --> 00:33:18,047
I don't suppose anybody
here speaks droid?

367
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,692
I believe he is asking
where we would like to go.

368
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:25,404
Down river. To the lava flat.

369
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,227
That's it. We're free!

370
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,524
No.

371
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:03,734
No, we're not.

372
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:06,767
Stormtroopers. They're flanking
the mouth of the tunnel.

373
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,156
It looks like an entire platoon.
They must know we're coming.

374
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,950
Stop the boat.

375
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:14,619
Hey, Droid, I said stop the boat.

376
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:18,540
Hey! I'm talking to you.

377
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:19,877
I said stop!

378
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:27,593
We're still moving.

379
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,718
Looks like we fight.

380
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,095
- There are too many.
- Then what do you suggest?

381
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,472
'Cause I can't surrender.

382
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:36,224
They will not be satisfied with
anything less than the child.

383
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:37,851
This is unacceptable.

384
00:34:37,853 --> 00:34:40,520
I will eliminate the
enemy and you will escape.

385
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:42,773
You don't have that
kind of firepower, pal.

386
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:44,441
You wouldn't even get to daylight.

387
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:46,109
That is not my objective.

388
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:48,864
We're getting close. Saddle up.

389
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:53,909
I still have the security
protocols from my manufacturer.

390
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:57,056
If my designs are compromised,
I must self-destruct.

391
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:58,685
What're you talking about?

392
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,415
I am not permitted to be
captured. I must be destroyed.

393
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:04,194
Are we gonna keep talking,
or get out of here?

394
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:06,256
I can no longer carry this for you.

395
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:10,549
Nor can I watch over the child.

396
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:13,011
Wait. You can't self-destruct.

397
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,888
Your base command is to watch the child.

398
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:17,417
That supersedes your
manufacturer's protocol, right?

399
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:19,935
- Right?
- This is correct.

400
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:22,646
Good. Now, grab a blaster
and help us shoot our way out.

401
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:24,439
Victory through combat is impossible.

402
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:27,275
We will be captured.
The child will be lost.

403
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:29,835
Sadly, there is no scenario
where the child is saved,

404
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,528
in which I survive.

405
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:33,859
Listen, you're not going anywhere.

406
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:35,487
We need you. Let's
just come up with a...

407
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,286
Please tell me the child
will be safe in your care.

408
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:41,125
If you do so, I can default
to my secondary command.

409
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,500
But you'll be destroyed.

410
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:47,089
And you will live, and I
will have served my purpose.

411
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:50,340
No. We need you.

412
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:53,635
There is nothing to be sad
about. I have never been alive.

413
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:55,595
I'm not sad.

414
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:59,558
Yes, you are. I'm a nurse
droid. I've analyzed your voice.

415
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:08,068
IG?

416
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,822
What're you doing?

417
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:47,022
Manufacturer's protocol
dictates I cannot be captured.

418
00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:50,453
I must be destroyed.

419
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:26,797
Moff Gideon!

420
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:43,286
- He missed!
- He won't next time.

421
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:45,247
Our blasters are useless against him.

422
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,390
Let's make the baby do
the magic hand thing.

423
00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:49,734
Come on, baby! Do the magic hand thing.

424
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:55,674
- I'm out of ideas.
- I'm not.

425
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,136
Here he comes!

426
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:18,233
No!

427
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,717
That was impressive,
Mando. Very impressive.

428
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:47,246
It looks like your Guild
rates have just gone up.

429
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:49,830
Any more stormtroopers?

430
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:51,417
I think we cleaned up the town.

431
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:55,127
I'm thinking of staying
around just to be sure.

432
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,560
You're staying here?

433
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,006
Well, why not?

434
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:02,426
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

435
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:05,595
And now that the scum and
villainy have been washed away,

436
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:07,389
it's very respectable again.

437
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:09,184
As a bounty hunter hive?

438
00:40:10,162 --> 00:40:13,520
Some of my favorite
people are bounty hunters.

439
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:16,014
And perhaps, this specimen of soldier

440
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:18,859
might consider joining our ranks.

441
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:22,342
Yeah. I've got some clerical
concerns regarding my chain code.

442
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:24,614
And if you would agree
to become my enforcer,

443
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:27,993
clerical concerns would be
the least of your worries.

444
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:30,108
But you, my friend,

445
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:33,457
you will be welcome back
into the Guild with open arms.

446
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:36,350
So, go off, enjoy yourself.

447
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,310
And when you're ready to return,

448
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,811
you will have the pick of all quarries.

449
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:50,142
I'm afraid I have more
pressing matters at hand.

450
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:58,400
Take care of this little one.

451
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:04,656
Or maybe, it'll take care of you.

452
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:05,340
What do you got there?

453
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,350
I didn't think I'd see this again.

454
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:27,946
Why don't you hang onto that?

455
00:43:49,498 --> 00:43:59,498
