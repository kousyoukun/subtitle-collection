1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,048
The Empire is gone, Mando.

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,636
This asset
was of extreme importance to me.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,972
<i>I had to ensure its delivery.</i>

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,891
He's not a local warlord.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,017
He's Imperial.

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,685
I'm in.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:23,023
<i>Our secrecy is our survival.
Our survival is our strength.</i>

8
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,503
<i>Our strength was once in our numbers.</i>

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,028
Now, we live in the shadows.

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,490
Our world was shattered by the Empire.

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,640
You're going
to have to relocate the covert.

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,933
This is the Way.

13
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,627
In the wake of your destruction,
it was left behind.

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,546
Is it still a hunter?

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,798
No. But it will protect.

16
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,217
You got a real thing for droids,
don't you?

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,654
I got a real thing for that droid.

18
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,137
Let me take the child to him...

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,764
Let's kill him and get out of here.

20
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,576
- We both need the client to be eliminated.
- He's right.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,995
As long as the Imp lives,
he'll send hunters after the child.

22
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,020
<i> It's a trap.</i>

23
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,815
<i>- Have they brought the child?</i>
- Yes, they have.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,612
<i>You have something I want.</i>

25
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,656
Kuiil? Are you there?

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,826
In a few moments...

27
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,871
<i> Kuiil! Are you there?</i>

28
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,957
...it will be mine.

29
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,608
Speeder bikes have arrived
at the checkpoint with the asset.

30
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,902
Awaiting confirmation.

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,320
Knock it off!

32
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,991
Waiting for confirmation
to continue into town.

33
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,715
<i>That's a go to proceed,
but I advise you to double-check.</i>

34
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,790
<i>The Moff just touched down and already
took out a squad of local troopers.</i>

35
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,168
Standing by.

36
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,632
Did he just say
that Gideon killed his own men?

37
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,884
Oh, who knows?

38
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,304
These guys like to lay down the law
when they first arrive into town.

39
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,223
You know how it is.

40
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,852
I said, shut up. Yeesh.

41
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,955
What is that thing, anyway?

42
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,039
Uh, I don't know.

43
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,732
Maybe Moff wants to eat it.
I don't ask questions.

44
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:13,986
Can I see it?

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,881
Did you not just hear
that Moff Gideon killed

46
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,824
a dozen of his own troopers
to make a point.

47
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,909
- Okay.
- I get that point.

48
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,012
- Do you get the point?
- Yes.

49
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,037
Okay.

50
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,417
Should we offer
that thing some water?

51
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,877
You just wanna look at it.

52
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,336
So what?
You got to see it!

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,361
Barely.

54
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,489
I mean, I grabbed it up off the ground
and I stuffed it in the sack.

55
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,634
It's more than I got to see it.

56
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,898
Look, I'm not taking it out of
this bag until I deliver it to the Moff.

57
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,706
- Fine.
- Okay. Stop asking.

58
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,214
Let me check on this thing. This is crazy.

59
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,340
Any update yet?

60
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,176
<i>That's a negative.
Still waiting on confirmation.</i>

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,070
<i>He just killed an officer
for interrupting him,</i>

62
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,096
<i>so this might take a while.</i>

63
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,806
Thank you.

64
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,434
Standing by still. Unbelievable.

65
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,563
Hey, how long has it been
since that thing moved?

66
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,024
I don't know,
like a minute or two. Don't worry.

67
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,860
Uh, it's been
way longer than a minute.

68
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,945
Oh, my God.

69
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,131
Shouldn't we check
and see if it's still alive?

70
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,448
You hit it pretty hard.

71
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,852
You just wanna see it.

72
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,677
We should check
and see if it's hurt.

73
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,745
The last thing that you want
is to give Gideon a bag

74
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,789
and have him open it
and find whatever is dead...

75
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay. Okay, look.
Here you go. See?

76
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,460
Take a peek. Everything's fine.

77
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,545
What is that?

78
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,648
I don't know.
It's a pet or something.

79
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,131
A pet? I thought you...

80
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,345
Serves you right.

81
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,722
Stop that.

82
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,683
Identify yourself!

83
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,226
I am IG-11.

84
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,480
I am this child's nurse droid and require
that you remand him to me immediately.

85
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,958
A nurse droid?

86
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,776
I thought it was a hunter.
Aren't IGs usually hunters?

87
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,195
Yeah, well,
evidently this one's a nurse.

88
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,283
I'm sorry, nurse,
but you're gonna have to get out of here.

89
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,910
Are you refusing my request?

90
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,287
No.

91
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,955
I'm telling you to get out of here.

92
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,546
Hey.

93
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,349
That was unpleasant.

94
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,851
I'm sorry you had to see that.

95
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,714
Is there another way out?

96
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,174
No, that's it.

97
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,261
- What about the sewers?
- Sewers?

98
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,781
The Mandalorians
have a covert down in the sewers.

99
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,058
If we can get down there,
they can help us escape.

100
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,559
Yeah, sewers are good.

101
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,363
Checking for access points.

102
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,358
What the hell are they waiting for?

103
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,664
Hold up.

104
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,256
They're setting up an E-Web.

105
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,092
It's over.

106
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,948
I found the sewer vent.

107
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,473
Let's get the hell out of here.

108
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,289
It's assembled!
How long until that thing's cleared?

109
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,166
- Blow it.
- I'm out of charges.

110
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,251
Get out of the way!

111
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,348
Your astute panic suggests
that you understand your situation.

112
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,227
I would prefer to avoid
any further violence,

113
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,397
and encourage a moment of consideration.

114
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,776
Members of my escort
have completed assembly

115
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,696
of an E-Web heavy repeating blaster.

116
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,782
If you are unfamiliar with this weapon,

117
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:14,912
I am sure that Republican Shock Trooper
Carasynthia Dune of Alderaan

118
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:20,334
will advise you that she has witnessed
many of her ranks vaporize mid-descent

119
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,004
facing the predecessor
of this particular model.

120
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:31,512
Or perhaps the decommissioned
Mandalorian hunter, Din Djarin,

121
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:36,058
has heard the songs
of the Siege of Mandalore,

122
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,186
when gunships outfitted
with similar ordnance

123
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:45,359
laid waste to fields of Mandalorian
recruits in The Night of a Thousand Tears.

124
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,575
I advise disgraced Magistrate Greef Karga
to search the wisdom of his years

125
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:59,456
and urge you to lay down your arms
and come outside.

126
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,001
The structure you are trapped in
will be razed in short order

127
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:07,422
and your storied lives will come
to an unceremonious end.

128
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,135
What do you propose?

129
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,180
Reasonable negotiation.

130
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,725
What assurance do you offer?

131
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,437
If you're asking
if you can trust me, you cannot.

132
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,483
Just as you betrayed
our business arrangement,

133
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,571
I would gladly break any promise
and watch you die at my hand.

134
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:35,242
The assurance I give is this:
I will act in my own self-interest,

135
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,496
which at this time involves
your cooperation and benefit.

136
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:48,213
I will give you until nightfall, and then
I will have the E-Web cannon open fire.

137
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,514
I say we hear him out.

138
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,391
The minute we open that door, we're dead.

139
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,893
We're dead if we don't.

140
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,936
At least out there, we've got a shot.

141
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,396
That's easy for you to say.

142
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,106
I'm a Rebel Shock Trooper.

143
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,941
They'll upload me to a Mind Flayer.

144
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,819
Those aren't real.
That was just wartime propaganda.

145
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,405
I don't care to find out.
I'm shooting my way out of here.

146
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,658
What about you, Mando?

147
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,102
I know who he is.

148
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,747
It's Moff Gideon.

149
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,873
No.

150
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,167
Moff Gideon was executed for war crimes.

151
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,669
It's him.
He knew my name.

152
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,129
So? What does that prove?

153
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,974
I haven't heard that name
spoken since I was a child.

154
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,258
On Mandalore?

155
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,344
I was not born on Mandalore.

156
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,512
But you're a Mandalorian.

157
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,430
Mandalorian isn't a race.

158
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,558
It's a Creed.

159
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,429
I was a foundling.

160
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,222
They raised me in the Fighting Corps.

161
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,391
I was treated as one of their own.

162
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,352
When I came of age,
I was sworn to the Creed.

163
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,939
The only record of my family name
was in the registers of Mandalore.

164
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,610
Moff Gideon was an ISB Officer
during the purge.

165
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,070
That's how I know it's him.

166
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,947
That's how he knows who we all are.

167
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,284
He says he needs us,
which means the child got away safely.

168
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,453
I was worried when the Ugnaught
didn't respond,

169
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,623
but if they'd captured the kid,
we'd already be dead.

170
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
Hail them again.

171
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,158
Come in, Kuiil.

172
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,006
Kuiil?

173
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,926
- Nothing.
- They might have jammed the link.

174
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,642
Kuiil has been terminated.

175
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,245
What did you do?

176
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,188
<i>I am fulfilling my base function.</i>

177
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,356
Which is?

178
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,149
To nurse and protect.

179
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:07,908
What was that?

180
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:08,992
Look alive.

181
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:50,826
Look!

182
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,434
Cover me.

183
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,413
Burn them out.

184
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,128
Stay with me, buddy.
We're gonna get you out of here.

185
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,088
This is our only path out.
Can you clear it?

186
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,618
Stay with me.

187
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,138
If you go near this child,
I will no choice but to kill you.

188
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:01,308
I understand.
Can you do anything to move the grate?

189
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,559
Yes, of course.

190
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,773
Oh, I love IG units.

191
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,329
I'm not gonna make it. Go.

192
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,154
Shut up. You just got your bell rung.
You'll be fine.

193
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,322
Leave me.

194
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:23,330
- I'm gonna need to take this thing off.
- No. You leave me.

195
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,958
You make sure the child is safe.

196
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,085
Here.

197
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,049
When you get to the Mandalorian covert,
you show them that.

198
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,469
You tell them it's from Din Djarin.

199
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,223
You tell them the foundling was
in my protection, and they'll help you.

200
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,058
We can make it.

201
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,110
Come on! Let's go!

202
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,353
I'm not gonna make it and you know it.

203
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,340
You protect the child.

204
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,260
I can hold them back long enough
for you to escape.

205
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,179
Let me have a warrior's death.

206
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,972
I won't leave you.

207
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,474
This is the Way.

208
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,368
Come on! It's open, let's go!

209
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,830
Go. Go.

210
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,166
We have to move! Now!

211
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,628
Go.

212
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,257
Escape and protect this child.

213
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,259
I will stay with the Mandalorian.

214
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:45,514
Promise me you'll bring him.

215
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,974
You have my word.

216
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,533
Do it.

217
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:05,993
Do what?

218
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,011
Just get it over with.

219
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,957
I'd rather you kill me than some Imp.

220
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,459
I told you.
I am no longer a hunter.

221
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,211
I am a nurse droid.

222
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,673
IGs are all hunters.

223
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,968
Not this one. I was reprogrammed.

224
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,888
I need to remove your helmet
if I am to save you.

225
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,102
Try it and I'll kill you.

226
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,441
It is forbidden.

227
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:42,321
No living thing has seen me
without my helmet since I swore the Creed.

228
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,949
I am not a living thing.

229
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:59,922
This is a bacta spray.
It will heal you in a matter of hours.

230
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,800
You have suffered damage
to your central processing unit.

231
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,221
You mean my brain?

232
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,849
That was a joke.
It is meant to put you at ease.

233
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,086
I got you.

234
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,478
Do you know which way to go?

235
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,564
No. I don't know these tunnels.

236
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,357
I've only entered from the bazaar.

237
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,738
Well, if we get the smell
of sulfur and we follow it,

238
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,491
it'll lead us up to the plains
where the river flows.

239
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,262
And the Imps will
catch us before we make it to the ship.

240
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:15,247
We need the Mandalorians
to escort us to safety.

241
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,672
Ugh, this place is a maze.

242
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:24,756
Stop.

243
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,759
I can stand.

244
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,803
The bacta infusion is working.

245
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:31,555
I'll try to find tracks.

246
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,474
We're close.

247
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:38,687
Turn here.

248
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,493
We should go.

249
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:38,664
You go. Take the ship.
I can't leave it this way.

250
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:39,957
Did you know about this?

251
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,417
Is this the work of your bounty hunters?

252
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,502
No.

253
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,296
When you left the system
and took the prize, the fighting ended

254
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,257
and the hunters just melted away.

255
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,217
You know how it is.

256
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,261
They're mercenaries. They're not zealots.

257
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,930
Did you do this? Did you?

258
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,099
- No!
- It was not his fault.

259
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,311
We revealed ourselves.

260
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,691
We knew what could happen
if we left the covert.

261
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,237
The Imperials arrived shortly thereafter.

262
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,366
This is what resulted.

263
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,160
Did any survive?

264
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:21,039
I hope so.
Some may have escaped off-world.

265
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,659
Come with us.

266
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:27,713
No.

267
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:32,050
I will not abandon this place
until I have salvaged what remains.

268
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:09,046
Show me the one
whose safety deemed such destruction.

269
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,050
This is the one.

270
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,470
This is the one that you hunted,
then saved?

271
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,681
Yes. The one that saved me as well.

272
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:23,185
- From the mudhorn?
- Yes.

273
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:25,687
It looks helpless.

274
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,275
It's injured, but it is not helpless.

275
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,569
Its species can move objects
with its mind.

276
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,863
I know of such things.

277
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:41,828
The songs of eons past tell of battles
between Mandalore The Great,

278
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:46,291
and an order of sorcerers called Jedi
that fought with such powers.

279
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,113
It is an enemy?

280
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,589
No. Its kind were enemies,
but this individual is not.

281
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,133
What is it?

282
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:57,636
It is a foundling.

283
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,224
By Creed, it is in your care.

284
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,496
You wish me to train this thing?

285
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,689
It is too weak. It would die.

286
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:12,359
You have no choice.
You must reunite it with its own kind.

287
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:14,152
Where?

288
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,946
This, you must determine.

289
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,008
You expect me to search the galaxy

290
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,176
for the home of this creature

291
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,703
and deliver it to a race
of enemy sorcerers?

292
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:25,873
This is the Way.

293
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,254
Hey.

294
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,465
These tunnels will be lousy with Imps
in a matter of minutes.

295
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,968
We should at least discuss an escape plan.

296
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,155
If you follow
the descending tunnel,

297
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,181
it will lead you to the underground river.

298
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:44,391
It flows downstream toward the lava flats.

299
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,352
I think we should go.

300
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:48,604
I'm staying.

301
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,689
I need to help her and I need to heal.

302
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:51,857
You must go.

303
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,568
A foundling is in your care.

304
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:59,990
By Creed, until it is of age or reunited
with its own kind,

305
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,783
you are as its father.

306
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,124
This is the Way.

307
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,504
You have earned your Signet.

308
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,187
You are a clan of two.

309
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,400
Thank you.

310
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:37,110
I will wear this with honor.

311
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,247
We should go.

312
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,791
IG, please guard
the outer hallway.

313
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,709
A scouting party draws near.

314
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:57,256
Hang on.
I don't do the baby thing.

315
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,094
I have one more gift
for your journey.

316
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,472
Have you trained in the Rising Phoenix?

317
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:07,349
When I was a boy. Yes.

318
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:11,228
Then this will make you complete.

319
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,356
Thank you.

320
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,984
ARMORER When you have healed,
you will begin your drills.

321
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,528
Until you know it,
it will not listen to your commands.

322
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:20,904
I understand.

323
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,585
You are protected.

324
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,775
More will come. You must go.

325
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:39,288
Come with us.

326
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,300
My place is here.

327
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,593
Restock your munitions.

328
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:50,225
IG, carry this for Din Djarin
until he is well enough to wear it.

329
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:52,895
Now, go.

330
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,980
Down to the river and across the plains.

331
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,483
Be safe on your journey.

332
00:30:58,567 --> 00:30:59,647
Thank you.

333
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,141
Hey, Mando.

334
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:33,810
Where are they?

335
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,773
I said, where are they?

336
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,138
This is the lava river.

337
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,450
The ferry droid is fried.

338
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,692
Yeah, but if we push the boat out,
we can get it to float downstream.

339
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:22,776
Come on.

340
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,671
Looks old. Will it take the heat?

341
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,280
You got a better idea?

342
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,860
Guess not.

343
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:32,828
Push!

344
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,540
Come on! What're you doing?

345
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,750
- Let's try this.
- Push!

346
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,047
You guys mind getting out of the way?

347
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,340
Oh!

348
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:51,847
Good job.

349
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:57,686
Watch your feet. It's molten lava.

350
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,021
No kidding.

351
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,542
I don't suppose anybody here speaks droid?

352
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,795
I believe he is asking
where we would like to go.

353
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:28,217
Down river. To the lava flat.

354
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,330
That's it. We're free!

355
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,170
No.

356
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:06,755
No, we're not.

357
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,092
Stormtroopers.
They're flanking the mouth of the tunnel.

358
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:13,178
It looks like an entire platoon.
They must know we're coming.

359
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,638
Stop the boat.

360
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,641
Hey, Droid, I said stop the boat.

361
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,562
Hey! I'm talking to you.

362
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,980
I said stop!

363
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,696
We're still moving.

364
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,739
Looks like we fight.

365
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:35,176
- There are too many.
- Then what do you suggest?

366
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,493
'Cause I can't surrender.

367
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:39,257
They will not be satisfied
with anything less than the child.

368
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:40,873
This is unacceptable.

369
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,542
I will eliminate the enemy
and you will escape.

370
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,854
You don't have
that kind of firepower, pal.

371
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:47,462
You wouldn't even get to daylight.

372
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:48,826
That is not my objective.

373
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,967
We're getting close. Saddle up.

374
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,930
I still have the security protocols
from my manufacturer.

375
00:34:57,014 --> 00:35:00,184
If my designs are compromised,
I must self-destruct.

376
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,870
What're you talking about?

377
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,396
I am not permitted to be captured.
I must be destroyed.

378
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,815
Are we gonna keep talking,
or get out of here?

379
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,359
I can no longer carry this for you.

380
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,030
Nor can I watch over the child.

381
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,033
Wait. You can't self-destruct.

382
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,910
Your base command is to watch the child.

383
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,329
That supersedes
your manufacturer's protocol, right?

384
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,956
- Right?
- This is correct.

385
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,727
Good. Now, grab a blaster
and help us shoot our way out.

386
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,471
Victory through combat
is impossible.

387
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:30,297
We will be captured.
The child will be lost.

388
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,176
Sadly, there is no scenario where
the child is saved, in which I survive.

389
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,113
Listen, you're not going anywhere.

390
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,740
We need you. Let's just come up with a...

391
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:41,308
Please tell me the child
will be safe in your care.

392
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,228
If you do so,
I can default to my secondary command.

393
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,493
But you'll be destroyed.

394
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:50,192
And you will live,
and I will have served my purpose.

395
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,362
No. We need you.

396
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,323
There is nothing to be sad about.
I have never been alive.

397
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,534
I'm not sad.

398
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,538
Yes, you are. I'm a nurse droid.
I've analyzed your voice.

399
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,171
IG?

400
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:14,925
What're you doing?

401
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:50,043
Manufacturer's protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

402
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,422
I must be destroyed.

403
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:29,750
Moff Gideon!

404
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,348
- He missed!
- He won't next time.

405
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,268
Our blasters are useless against him.

406
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:50,270
Let's make the baby do
the magic hand thing.

407
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,481
Come on, baby! Do the magic hand thing.

408
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:58,695
- I'm out of ideas.
- I'm not.

409
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,239
Here he comes!

410
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,195
No!

411
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:46,637
That was impressive, Mando.
Very impressive.

412
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:50,349
It looks like your Guild rates
have just gone up.

413
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,911
Any more stormtroopers?

414
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,520
I think we cleaned up the town.

415
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,814
I'm thinking of staying around
just to be sure.

416
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,087
- You're staying here?
- Well, why not?

417
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,447
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

418
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:08,617
And now that the scum and villainy
have been washed away,

419
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,410
it's very respectable again.

420
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:12,287
As a bounty hunter hive?

421
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:16,542
Some of my favorite people
are bounty hunters.

422
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:21,880
And perhaps, this specimen of soldier
might consider joining our ranks.

423
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:25,467
Yeah. I've got some clerical
concerns regarding my chain code.

424
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:27,695
And if you would agree
to become my enforcer,

425
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,014
clerical concerns would be
the least of your worries.

426
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:36,478
But you, my friend, you will be welcome
back into the Guild with open arms.

427
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,856
So, go off, enjoy yourself.

428
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:43,735
And when you're ready to return,
you will have the pick of all quarries.

429
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:53,245
I'm afraid I have
more pressing matters at hand.

430
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,503
Take care of this little one.

431
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:07,759
Or maybe, it'll take care of you.

432
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,128
What do you got there?

433
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,252
I didn't think I'd see this again.

434
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,968
Why don't you hang onto that?
