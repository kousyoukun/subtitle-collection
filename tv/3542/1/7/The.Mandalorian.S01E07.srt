你是受雇来干活的  那就做好你的工作
You were hired to do a job. So do it.

9
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,150
这不是你的信条吗
Isn't that your code?

10
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,800
你不是个诚信的人吗
Aren't you a man of honor?

11
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,690
{\an8}前情回顾

12
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,170
IG型机器人  退下
IG Unit! Stand down.

13
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,260
你也是公会成员
You are a Guild member?

14
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,390
我有个提议  我们平分赏金
I have a suggestion. We split the reward.

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,620
你这手艺可以当我的船员
I could use a crew member of your ability.

16
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,490
我很荣幸  但我奋斗了一辈子
I am honored, but I have worked a lifetime

17
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,800
最终摆脱了奴役
to finally be free of servitude.

18
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,990
那我只能表达谢意了
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,570
我也一样
And I offer mine.

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,560
感谢你为我的山谷带来安宁
Thank you for bringing peace to my valley.

21
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,950
恩多之战之后  我的大部分记录都被抹除了
I saw most of my action cleaning up after Endor.

22
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,140
大部分前帝国时期的军阀
Mostly Ex-Imperial warlords.

23
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,920
货物虽小  但赏金丰盛
Such a large bounty for such a small package.

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,200
-他们要拿它怎么样吗  -我没问过
- What they're gonna do with it? - I didn't ask.

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,760
这有背公会准则
It's against the Guild Code.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,060
{\an8}《星球大战》

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,740
我的朋友  如果你收到这条信息
My friend, if you are receiving this transmission,

28
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,980
说明你还活着
that means you are alive.

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,430
可能你会很惊讶  但我也还活着
You might be surprised to hear this, but I am alive too.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,450
我想我们扯平了
I guess we can call it even.

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,240
自从上次一别后又发生了很多事情
A lot has happened since we last saw each other.

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,980
上次雇佣你的人还在这里
The man who hired you is still here,

33
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,620
他的前帝国保卫等级又提高了
and his ranks of ex-Imperial guards have grown.

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,560
他们开始施行专制统治
They have imposed despotic rule over my city,

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,240
这严重影响了公会的生存
which has impeded the livelihood of the Guild.

36
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,380
我们把他列为敌人
We consider him an enemy,

37
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,880
但我们无法接近他以除后患
but we cannot get close enough to take him out.

38
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,150
如果你愿意接受这最后的一项任务
If you would consider one last commission,

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,970
我会保证你不虚此行
I will very much make it worth your while.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,300
你到如今都能成功解决掉所有追兵
You have been successful so far in staving off their hunters,

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,980
但他们绝不会善罢甘休
but they will not stop until they have their prize.

42
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,510
所以我的提议是
So, here is my proposition.

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,500
回到内瓦罗  把孩子作为诱饵
Return to Nevarro. Bring the child as bait.

44
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,450
我会安排一场交易
I will arrange an exchange,

45
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,420
并提供最忠诚的公会成员作为保护
and provide loyal Guild members as protection.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,730
一旦我们接近委托人
Once we get near the client,

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,210
你杀了他  我们各得其所
you kill him, and we both get what we want.

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,860
如果你成功了  孩子归你
If you succeed, you keep the child

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,500
我会把你的名字从公会清除掉
and I will have your name cleared with the Guild,

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,210
荣誉之人不应该一生流亡
for a man of honor should not be forced to live in exile.

51
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,290
我期待你的到来
I await your arrival with optimism.

52
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,000
{\an8}《曼达洛人》

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,150
{\an8}第一季  第七章

54
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,150
{\an8}最后审判

55
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,040
付钱啊  伙计们
Pay up, mudscuffers!

56
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,400
来吧  都是我的  谢谢你们
Come on. That's mine, thank you.

57
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,240
好的  谢谢
All right, thank you.

58
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,070
有活儿干不干
Looking for some work?

59
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,530
听上去是一项简单的任务
It seems like a straightforward operation.

60
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,980
他们提供方案和火力  我是个圈套
They're providing the plan and firepower. I'm the snare.

61
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,340
-用这个孩子  -这就是为什么我要来找你
- With the kid? - That's why I'm coming to you.

62
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,930
我不知道  有人告诉我要保持低调
I don't know. I've been advised to lay low.

63
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,520
如果有人发现了我的链码
If anybody runs my chain code,

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,180
我下半辈子就要烂在牢里了
I'll rot in a cell for the rest of my life.

65
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,420
我还以为你是个老手
I thought you were a veteran.

66
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,150
马上回来
Come back soon.

67
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,570
我退役后接过很多活
I've been a lot of things since.

68
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,350
他们大多数人都被判终生监禁
Most of them carry a life sentence.

69
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,220
如果我有记录登上新共和国的飞船
If I so much as book passage on a ship

70
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,780
那我可就
registered to the New Republic, I'm...

71
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,750
我有自己的飞船
I have a ship.

72
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,760
我能带你去拿一份很高的报酬回来
I can bring you there and back with a handsome reward.

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,330
你可以生存无忧
You can live free of worry.

74
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,690
我已经没什么好担心的了
I'm already free of worry,

75
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,410
而且我再也不想扮演士兵的角色
and I'm not in the mood to play soldier anymore.

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,930
尤其是和某些当地军阀作对
Especially fighting some local warlord.

77
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,570
他不是军阀
He's not a local warlord.

78
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,650
他是帝国的人
He's Imperial.

79
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,200
我加入
I'm in.

80
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,690
你的联系人需要审查我吗
Does your contact need to vet me?

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,590
他不知道你要来
Doesn't know you're coming.

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,730
真的吗  那可能会惹麻烦
Really? That could be a problem.

83
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,370
不会的
It won't.

84
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,760
就算有  那也是他的麻烦
But if it is, that's his problem.

85
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,490
他一个人在上面没事吗
He all right up there alone?

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,180
没事
Yeah.

87
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,730
选一个
Pick one.

88
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,040
你相信联系人吗
You trust the contact?

89
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,390
不太信
Not particularly.

90
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,220
我们上次有些争吵
He and I had a run-in last time

91
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,890
当时我还在参与公会事务
I was there on some Guild business.

92
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,320
那我们为什么要去
So then why are we going?

93
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,170
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

94
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,770
你看到索根星球上发生了什么
You saw what happened on Sorgan.

95
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
他们一直派猎人来
They'll keep sending hunters.

96
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,260
那个帝国人不亡  这个孩子就永无宁日
The kid will never be safe until the Imp is dead.

97
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,610
你把他带回去没事吗
And you're okay with bringing him back there?

98
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,130
不太放心  所以我把你带来了
Not really. That's why I'm bringing you.

99
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,550
我们需要有人看着他
We need someone to watch that thing.

100
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,650
是啊
Yeah.

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,300
你有可以信任的人吗
You got anyone you can trust?

102
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,300
小心点  看着点
Whoa! Easy. Whoa!

103
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,520
他没怎么长啊
It hasn't grown much.

104
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,500
我觉得它可能是基因生产的
I think it might be a Strand-Cast.

105
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,070
我不认为它是工程产物
I don't think it was engineered.

106
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,440
我在基因农场工作过
I've worked in the gene farms.

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,590
这只看上去是进化的  太丑了
This one looks evolved. Too ugly.

108
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,930
这一只  话说回来
This one, on the other hand,

109
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,050
看上去像是诺拉的细胞库生产的
looks like she was farmed in the Cytocaves of Nora.

110
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,170
这位是卡拉·杜娜  她曾是一名震击兵
This is Cara Dune. She was a shock trooper.

111
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,340
你以前是伞兵
You were a Dropper?

112
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,320
你也服过役吗
Did you serve?

113
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,040
不过是你敌人那边的
On the other side, I'm afraid.

114
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,020
但我可以很骄傲地说我还清了我的欠款
But I'm proud to say that I paid out my clan's debt,

115
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,220
我现在只为自己而活
and now I serve no one but myself.

116
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,460
有人想喝点茶吗
Would anyone care for some tea?

117
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,660
请把枪放下  他不会伤害你
Please lower your blasters. He will not harm you.

118
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,520
那家伙的程序就是用来杀这孩子的
That thing is programmed to kill the baby.

119
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,690
再也不会了
Not anymore.

120
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,830
你在那大闹一番后  它被遗弃在那里
It was left behind in the wake of your destruction.

121
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,020
我在它倒下的地方发现了它
I found it laying where it fell.

122
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,010
没有生命
Devoid of all life.

123
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,730
我清理了碎片
I recovered the flotsam and staked it as my own

124
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,010
按照新共和国宪章据为己有
in accordance with the Charter of the New Republic.

125
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,970
它的神经束所剩无几
Little remained of its neural harness.

126
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,480
重建虽难
Reconstruction was quite difficult...

127
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,380
但也不是没有可能
but not impossible.

128
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,510
所有的一切必须从零开始学
It had to learn everything from scratch.

129
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,220
这可不是扭扭扳手
This is something that

130
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,840
就能学会的事情
cannot be taught with the twist of a spanner.

131
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,700
需要耐心和不停重复
It requires patience and repetition.

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,700
我日复一日地优化它
I spent day after day reinforcing its development

133
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,890
费了不少耐心和信心
with patience and affirmation.

134
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,960
它的个性随着经历增加不断发展
It developed a personality as its experiences grew.

135
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,870
它现在还是猎人吗
Is it still a hunter?

136
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,500
不  但它会保护
No. But it will protect.

137
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,340
要喝茶吗
Tea?

138
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,690
我遇到了一些问题
I've run into some problems.

139
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,420
我大概猜到了  不然你为什么还要回来
I figured as much. Why else would you return?

140
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,680
我想雇佣你
I wanna hire your services.

141
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,240
我已经退休了
I'm retired from service.

142
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,660
乌格瑙特人  我可以出高价的
I can pay you handsomely, Ugnaught.

143
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,900
我有名字的  叫库伊尔
I have a name. It is Kuiil.

144
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,160
库伊尔  我需要有人来保护这小家伙
I need someone to protect the little one, Kuiil.

145
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,700
那不太适合我
I'm not suited for such work.

146
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,160
不过我可以重新编程IG-11  让他去做
I can reprogram IG-11 for nursing and protocol.

147
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,360
不  我不希望有机器人靠近他半步
No. I don't want that droid anywhere near him.

148
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,640
为什么你这么不信任机器人
Why're you so distrustful of droids?

149
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,100
他们曾经试图杀死他
It tried to kill him.

150
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,360
那是被编程出来的
It was programmed to do so.

151
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,300
机器人没有好坏之分
Droids are not good or bad.

152
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,360
他们不过是
They are neutral reflections

153
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,440
创造者最真实的反映
of those who imprint them.

154
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,280
我不这么认为
I've seen otherwise.

155
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,240
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

156
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,680
就目前来看  当然
From what I can tell, yes.

157
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,220
那你自然也会相信我所创造的东西
Then you will trust my work.

158
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,800
IG-11要和我一起
IG-11 will join me.

159
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,860
我们不要你的报酬
And we do it not for payment,

160
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,060
只为保护他免受帝国奴役
but to protect the child from Imperial slavery.

161
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,540
旧势力一日不除
None will be free

162
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,540
我们一日无法获得真正的自由
until the old ways are gone forever.

163
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,540
好吧
Okay.

164
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
同时我还要带上布勒格兽
And the blurrgs will join me as well.

165
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,900
布勒格兽
The blurrgs?

166
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,460
我言已毕
I have spoken.

167
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,420
你输定了  曼达佬
I got you, Mando.

168
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,360
有胆加加注吗
Dare to double the bet?

169
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,580
干什么  不  快停手
No! No, no! Stop!

170
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,280
我们是朋友  我们是朋友
We're friends, we're friends.

171
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,510
卡拉是我们的朋友
Cara is my friend!

172
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,800
瞧瞧它做的好事
That is not okay!

173
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,640
有意思
Hmm. Very curious.

174
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,060
有意思  我差点死在他手上
Curious? It almost killed me!

175
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,600
你当初和我讲的泥角兽的故事
The story you told me of the mudhorn

176
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,060
现在看起来合理多了
now makes more sense.

177
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,980
他到底是什么
What is it?

178
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,040
它是什么  我也不知道
What it is, I don't know.

179
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,620
不过它刚刚展现的能力
But what it does, this...

180
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,460
我早有所耳闻
This I've heard rumors of.

181
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,920
什么  是你为帝国工作时听到的吗
What? When you worked for the Empire?

182
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,520
我是被一纸奴隶契约卖给帝国的
When I was sold to the Empire, in indentured servitude.

183
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
但你却就这么被放了
Yet somehow, you walk free.

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,380
我借我的巧手
I bought my freedom through the skill of my hands

185
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,480
和长达人类生命三倍时间的劳动换来的自由
and the labor of three of your human lifetimes.

186
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,200
别质疑
Do not cast doubt upon

187
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,440
别质疑我的身份以及我的归属
that of what I am nor whom I shall serve.

188
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,780
别吵了
Tell you what.

189
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
我现在真需要你的帮忙了
I could really use your craftwork right now.

190
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,420
你能把这摇篮盖好
Can you pad this container

191
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,460
好让他更好的睡觉吗
so the child can sleep better?

192
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,020
我应该造个更好的
I shall fabricate a better one.

193
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,000
好让这家伙看看
Then perhaps this Dropper can see

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,540
我是怎么
how one can win their freedom

195
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,960
通过双手赢得得自由
with the skill of one's hands.

196
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
所以我们要去内瓦罗  对吗
So, we're going to Nevarro?

197
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,500
-你之前去过吗  -没
- Have you ever been? - No.

198
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,580
我们很多的军队在那丧生了
We lost a lot of our forces there.

199
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,840
那城市深陷地表之下
The city's dug in pretty deep.

200
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,160
在那很难找到掩体
No cover when you drop in.

201
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,820
直到大战过后  它才脱离帝国的管控
It stayed in Empire control 'till the end of the war.

202
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,640
这次要处理的是一个帝国军官
The warlord we're taking out was an Imperial officer.

203
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,860
-干什么的  -不清楚
- What station? - Hard to tell.

204
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,420
已经没有具体描述了
No insignia anymore.

205
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,580
当我救那孩子时
I took out the safehouse

206
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,020
已经把安全屋都毁了
when I snatched the kid.

207
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,460
从那以后已经有更多的帝国军驻扎了进去
More Imps have reinforced since.

208
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,300
还有更多其他的变化
There's something more going on.

209
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,220
也许吧  我们着陆之后就会知晓了
Maybe. We'll find out more when we land.

210
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,580
第二餐已经准备好了
I have prepared second meal.

211
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,440
您是想在这用餐还是下去吃
Would you care to be served here or below?

212
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,250
我现在还不饿
I'm not hungry.

213
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,700
那东西怎么都不肯离开我的飞船
Under no circumstances does that thing leave the ship.

214
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,680
你对付机器人可有一套  不是吗
You got a real thing for droids, don't you?

215
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,740
我对付那机器人有一套
I got a real thing for that droid.

216
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,520
那个乌格瑙特人说他已经给它重新编程了
The Ugnaught said he rewired it.

217
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,620
那机器人是用来杀人的
That droid was designed to kill things.

218
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,200
我不管它被做了多少改造
I don't care how much wiring he replaced.

219
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,960
这都有背它的本性
It goes against its nature.

220
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,820
反正这次任务要不了多久
Well, it shouldn't be a long job anyway.

221
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,980
等我们把帝国头目干掉
We take out the head Imp,

222
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,780
其他人只会抱头鼠窜了
the rest will run like rats.

223
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,400
很抱歉在这种鸟不拉屎的地方碰头  曼达佬
Sorry for the remote rendezvous, Mando,

224
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,900
不过自从你走之后
but things have gotten complicated

225
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,920
这情况复杂了许多
since you were last here.

226
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,840
看来大家都准备好了
It appears that introductions are in order.

227
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,780
我们两边的安保措施都做得不错嘛
It seems we've both provided a security detail.

228
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,820
我推荐这位震击兵去保护飞船
I recommend the shock trooper guards the ship.

229
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,920
这一块火山岩地区到处都是贾瓦人
These lava fields are lousy with Jawas.

230
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,340
她要和我一起行动
She's coming with me.

231
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,880
但那城镇现在由前帝国管控
But the town is now run by ex-Empire.

232
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,920
如果有反叛军和我在一起
If a Rebel Dropper is with us,

233
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,600
他们会立刻警觉
they'll all get their hackles up.

234
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,400
我说了她和我一起去
She's coming.

235
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,080
好
Fine.

236
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,200
你说是就是吧
Fine.

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,240
至少把你的纹身挡一挡吧
At least cover your tattoo.

238
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,920
没必要这么招摇过市
No need to flaunt it.

239
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,080
那小家伙在哪
Now, where is the little one?

240
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,060
就因为这小东西
So, this little bogwing is

241
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,480
才惹了这么多麻烦
what all the fuss was about.

242
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,720
多么可爱的小家伙啊
What a precious little creature.

243
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
我终于理解了
I can see why you didn't

244
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,780
为什么你不想让它受伤了
want to harm a hair on its wrinkled little head.

245
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,100
不过  真高兴这件事
Well, I'm glad this matter

246
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,880
终于有个了结了
will be put to rest once and for all.

247
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,700
内瓦罗日落很快
The sun drops fast on Nevarro.

248
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,400
我们可以前进一段路程  在河畔扎营
We can walk for a spell, camp out at the riverbank,

249
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,350
然后天一亮就进城
then make our way into town at first light.

250
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,640
我猜这小家伙是肉食动物吧
I guess the little bugger's a carnivore.

251
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,260
我还从来没看到过它这样的东西
Never seen anything like it.

252
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,480
他们为它开了天价的赎金
They were ready to pay a king's ransom for that thing.

253
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,760
一定是什么高级生物吧
Must be for some kind of highfalutin menagerie.

254
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,540
再过一遍计划
Let's go over the plan again.

255
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,440
我们俩一起进房子
We both enter the common house.

256
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,280
给接头人看诱饵
We show the client the bait.

257
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,400
坐下谈判  然后你找机会他给杀了
We join him at the table. And you kill him.

258
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
跟我说说增援情况
Tell me about his reinforcements.

259
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,740
他们都是前帝国士兵
They're all ex-Empire.

260
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,560
一旦他们头被杀了
As soon as they lose their paycheck,

261
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,580
就树倒猢狲散了
poof, they'll all scatter.

262
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,060
如果不像你所言呢
And what if they don't?

263
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,800
不可能的
They will.

264
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,540
这可不行
That's not good enough.

265
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,080
如果真的出现紧急情况
If, for argument's sake,

266
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,540
而他们又没有意识到
a few of them don't realize

267
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,740
我是他们的下一位金主
that I'm their best path to alternative employment

268
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,300
并决定意气用事时
and they elect to react impulsively,

269
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,100
这三位优秀的公会猎人
then these three fine Guild Hunters,

270
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,060
以及那位老练的震击兵
along with that battle-hardened shock trooper,

271
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,680
会立刻杀一儆百
will cut down anyone who bucks.

272
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,380
那会有多少人
How many will there be?

273
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,630
不超过四个
No more than four.

274
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,980
他最多就带一个火力组
He travels with, at most, a Fire Team.

275
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,280
相信我
Trust me.

276
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,420
不会出什么乱子的
Nothing can go wrong.

277
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,880
放开她
No! Let go of her!

278
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,420
把她放下
Drop her now!

279
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,920
放下她
Drop her!

280
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,600
他受重伤了
He's hurt badly.

281
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,320
我没事  相信我  我没事的
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Ow!

282
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,600
握紧
Hold still.

283
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,360
这会对你有所好转的
They got you good.

284
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,820
伤的有多重
How bad?

285
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,700
不容乐观
Bad.

286
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,620
毒素在迅速传播
The poison's spreading fast.

287
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,750
所以
So this...

288
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,510
这就是我的终点了吗
This is how it happens.

289
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,440
别想得这么夸张
Don't be so dramatic.

290
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,780
我需要多一个药包
I need another medpac!

291
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,510
还有药包吗
Got any other medpacs?

292
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,030
有人有吗
Anyone?

293
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,880
我猜是没有了
I'm guessing that's a "No".

294
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,100
毒还在扩散
It's still spreading.

295
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,490
这不太好
This isn't working.

296
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,640
带这玩意儿走
Get this thing outta here.

297
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,980
等等
Wait.

298
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,940
他想吃了我
He's trying to eat me.

299
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,070
你觉得他们改主意了吗
You think they're having second thoughts?

300
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,400
可能吧
Could be.

301
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,970
我需要你帮我看着
I need your eyes.

302
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,520
我在看
I'm watching.

303
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,520
我猜我们到了
I guess this is it.

304
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,300
我要告诉你们一些事
There's something you should know.

305
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,510
我们的计划是杀了你  带走孩子
The plan was to kill you and take the kid.

306
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,940
但经过昨晚的事
But after what happened last night,

307
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,740
我不忍心这么做
I couldn't go through with it.

308
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,360
来吧  你们可以现在就杀了我
Go on. You can gun me down here and now

309
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,840
这也不违反公会准则
and it wouldn't violate the Code.

310
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,640
但是我死了  这个孩子永远都不会安全
But if you do, this child will never be safe.

311
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,180
我们愿意冒这个险
We'll take our chances.

312
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,820
这个帝国委托人非常想要得到目标
The Imperial client is obsessed with obtaining this asset.

313
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,650
你可以逃
You tried to run,

314
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,080
但你能跑去哪
but where did it get you?

315
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,480
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

316
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,700
或许你应该听听他说的
Perhaps you should let him speak.

317
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,890
听着  我们都想除掉委托人
Listen, we both need the client to be eliminated.

318
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,430
让我把孩子带给他  然后你们俩...
Let me take the child to him and then you two...

319
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,220
不
No.

320
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,160
我们直接杀了他离开这吧
Let's just kill him and get outta here.

321
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,440
他说得对
He's right.

322
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,830
你在干什么
What are you doing?

323
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,820
只要委托人还活着
As long as the Imp lives,

324
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,580
他就会一直派人来找这孩子
he'll send hunters after the child.

325
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,880
这是陷阱
It's a trap.

326
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,000
带我去
Bring me.

327
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,760
带你去
Bring you?

328
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,200
告诉他你抓到我了
Tell him you captured me.

329
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,780
带我靠近他我就可以杀了他
Get me close to him and I'll kill him.

330
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,860
这是个好主意
That's a good idea.

331
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,280
把爆能枪给我
Give me your blaster.

332
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,620
这太疯狂了
This is insane.

333
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,110
这是唯一的办法
It's the only way.

334
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,040
那我跟你一起去
Well, I'm coming with you.

335
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,440
不不不  这会让他们起疑心的
No, no, no. That would make them suspicious.

336
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,340
我不在乎  我就要去
I don't care. I'm coming.

337
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,570
就说是她抓到了我
Tell them she caught me.

338
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,880
好啊  那她可以带上孩子
Fine. Then she can bring the child.

339
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,160
不  孩子留在飞船上
No. The kid goes back in the ship.

340
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,140
但没有孩子  这都不会管用的
But without the child, none of this works!

341
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,180
我有计划
I have a plan.

342
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,900
库伊尔  回飞船那去
Kuiil, ride back to the Razor Crest

343
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,880
带上孩子  躲在里面
with the child and seal yourself in.

344
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,840
你一进去就启动地面安全协议
When you're inside, engage ground security protocols.

345
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,390
这星球没有东西能攻破那扇门
Nothing on this planet will breach those doors.

346
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,270
这是通讯器
Here's a comlink.

347
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,810
我会保护好这个孩子的
I will keep the child safe.

348
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,100
别忘了遮住你们的纹身
Don't forget to cover your stripes.

349
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,200
我们走吧
Let's go.

350
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,880
链码
Chain code?

351
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,700
我给老板带了份礼物
I have a gift for the boss.

352
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,740
链码
Chain code?

353
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,110
我用20信用点买你的头盔
I'll give you 20 credits for the helmet.

354
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,200
不可能  那是我的
Not a chance. That's going on my wall.

355
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,420
你的
On your wall?

356
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,700
忍忍吧
Go with it.

357
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,310
走吧
Go ahead.

358
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,050
你说只有四个
You said four.

359
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,890
这可不止四个士兵
There are more than four troopers.

360
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,640
保护委托人的只有四个
Four guarding the client.

361
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,820
镇上会有很多
Many more here in town.

362
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,810
曼达佬走进安全屋之后气氛更凝重了
Things got really heated once Mando crashed the safehouse.

363
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,970
把爆能枪塞给他
Slip him his blaster.

364
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,230
还不是时候
Not yet.

365
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,900
我们到了
Here we are.

366
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,330
看见了吗  四个
You see? Four.

367
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,580
我遵守了约定把人带回来了
Look what I brought you. As promised.

368
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,560
多么精湛的手艺
What exquisite craftmanship.

369
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,220
曼达洛铁能经祖传工匠之手
It is amazing how beautiful beskar can be

370
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,800
变得如此美  真是太神奇了
when forged by its ancestral artisans.

371
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,500
我能为我们合作的完结
Can I offer you a libation

372
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,770
敬你一杯酒吗
to celebrate the closing of our shared narrative?

373
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,910
我很荣幸
I would be obliged.

374
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,490
请坐
Please sit.

375
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,980
我对你们族人的遭遇感到遗憾
It is a shame that your people suffered so.

376
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,760
像这种情况  是完全可以避免的
Just as in this situation, it was all avoidable.

377
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,090
为什么曼达洛人会抵制我们的扩张呢
Why did Mandalore resist our expansion?

378
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,180
帝国能让其所触的体系更完善
The Empire improves every system it touches.

379
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,110
在任何层面来说都是
Judge by any metric.

380
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,340
安全  繁荣  交易  机遇  和平
Safety, prosperity, trade, opportunity, peace.

381
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,640
你们对比一下帝国统治时期与现在的情势
Compare Imperial rule to what is happening now.

382
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,050
你们看看外面的世界
Look outside.

383
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,550
起义之后世界变得更和平了吗
Is the world more peaceful since the revolution?

384
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,720
我看到的
I see nothing

385
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,840
只有死亡和混乱
but death and chaos.

386
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,600
我想要看一下孩子
I would like to see the baby.

387
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,130
它睡着了
It is asleep.

388
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,540
那我们安静点
We all will be quiet.

389
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,370
打开婴儿车
Open the pram.

390
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,120
请原谅
Don't think me to be rude.

391
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,720
我必须要接这个通讯
I must take this call.

392
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,740
把爆能枪给我
Give me the blaster.

393
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,950
你只有一次机会
You get one shot.

394
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,560
情况不太好  你说只有四个的
This is bad. You said four.

395
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,610
那现在多了几个人  我能预料到吗
Well, there are more. What can I tell you?

396
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,950
你好  莫夫·吉迪恩
Yes, Moff Gideon?

397
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,070
他们把孩子带来了吗
Have they brought the child?

398
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,360
带来了  孩子现在在睡觉
Yes, they have. Currently, it is sleeping.

399
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,420
那你得再检查一下了
You may wanna check again.

400
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,520
四个风暴兵
Four stormtroopers?

401
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,250
这不太妙
This is bad.

402
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,060
库伊尔  你回到飞船上了吗
Kuiil? Are you back to the ship yet?

403
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,490
听得到吗  收到了吗
Are you there? Do you copy?

404
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,190
听到
Yes!

405
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,410
-你回到飞船上了吗  -还没
- Are you back to the ship yet? - Not yet.

406
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,360
快回到飞船然后离开  把孩子带走
Get back to the ship and bail. Get the kid out of here.

407
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,830
我们被困住了
We're pinned down!

408
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,960
你有我想要的东西
You have something I want.

409
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,740
这家伙是谁
Who's this guy?

410
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,000
你以为你知道
You may think you have some idea of

411
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,880
你拥有的是什么
what you are in possession of,

412
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,700
但你并不知道
but you do not.

413
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,820
库伊尔  你回到飞船了吗  他们盯上我们了
Kuiil, are you back to the ship yet? They're onto us!

414
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,590
库伊尔  回话
Kuiil, come in!

415
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,180
几分钟之后
In a few moments,

416
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,820
它将会是我的
it will be mine.

417
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,760
库伊尔  你收到了吗
Kuiil! Do you copy?

418
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,350
库伊尔
Kuiil!

419
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,140
它对我来说
It means more to me

420
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,140
远比你知道的要重要
than you will ever know.

421
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,250
库伊尔  你听到吗
Kuiil! Are you there?

422
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,660
回话  库伊尔
Come in, Kuiil.

423
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,250
