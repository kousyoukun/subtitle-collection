1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,714
You were hired to do a job. So do it.

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,799
Isn't that your code?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,677
Aren't you a man of honor?

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,142
IG Unit! Stand down.

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,312
You are a Guild member?

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,676
I have a suggestion.
We split the reward.

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,505
I could use a crew member of your ability.

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,492
I am honored, but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,702
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,913
And I offer mine.

11
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,499
Thank you for bringing peace to my valley.

12
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,085
I saw most of my action
cleaning up after Endor.

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,212
Mostly Ex-Imperial warlords.

14
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,508
Such a large bounty
for such a small package.

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,468
What they're gonna do with it?

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,553
I didn't ask.

17
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,721
It's against the Guild Code.

18
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,569
My friend,
if you are receiving this transmission,

19
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,905
that means you are alive.

20
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:57,492
You might be surprised to hear this,
but I am alive too.

21
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,453
I guess we can call it even.

22
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,248
A lot has happened
since we last saw each other.

23
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,168
The man who hired you is still here,

24
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,630
and his ranks of ex-Imperial guards
have grown.

25
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,425
They have imposed despotic rule
over my city,

26
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,303
which has impeded
the livelihood of the Guild.

27
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,891
We consider him an enemy, but we cannot
get close enough to take him out.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,980
If you would consider one last commission,
I will very much make it worth your while.

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,902
You have been successful so far
in staving off their hunters,

30
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,113
but they will not stop
until they have their prize.

31
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,824
So, here is my proposition.

32
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,411
Return to Nevarro.
Bring the child as bait.

33
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,875
I will arrange an exchange, and provide
loyal Guild members as protection.

34
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,214
Once we get near the client, you kill him,
and we both get what we want.

35
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,801
If you succeed, you keep the child

36
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,512
and I will have your name
cleared with the Guild,

37
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,307
for a man of honor should not be forced
to live in exile.

38
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,352
I await your arrival with optimism.

39
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,144
Pay up, mudscuffers!

40
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,189
Come on. That's mine, thank you.

41
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,276
All right, thank you.

42
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,779
Looking for some work?

43
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,540
It seems like a straightforward operation.

44
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,794
They're providing the plan and firepower.
I'm the snare.

45
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,130
- With the kid?
- That's why I'm coming to you.

46
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,632
I don't know.
I've been advised to lay low.

47
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:44,136
If anybody runs my chain code, I'll rot
in a cell for the rest of my life.

48
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,180
I thought you were a veteran.

49
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,182
Come back soon.

50
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,353
I've been a lot of things since.
Most of them carry a life sentence.

51
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,732
If I so much as book passage on a ship
registered to the New Republic, I'm...

52
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,252
I have a ship.
I can bring you there and back

53
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,777
with a handsome reward.

54
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,279
You can live free of worry.

55
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,239
I'm already free of worry,

56
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,700
and I'm not in the mood
to play soldier anymore.

57
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,077
Especially fighting some local warlord.

58
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,205
He's not a local warlord.

59
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,289
He's Imperial.

60
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,544
I'm in.

61
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,552
Does your contact need to vet me?

62
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,679
Doesn't know you're coming.

63
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,681
Really? That could be a problem.

64
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,058
It won't.

65
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,810
But if it is, that's his problem.

66
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,734
He all right up there alone?

67
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,653
Yeah.

68
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,156
Pick one.

69
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,954
You trust the contact?

70
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,397
Not particularly.

71
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,377
He and I had a run-in last time
I was there on some Guild business.

72
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,088
So then why are we going?

73
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,091
I don't have a choice.

74
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,884
You saw what happened on Sorgan.

75
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,470
They'll keep sending hunters.

76
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,473
The kid will never be safe
until the Imp is dead.

77
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,811
And you're okay
with bringing him back there?

78
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,772
Not really. That's why I'm bringing you.

79
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,013
We need someone to watch that thing.

80
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,097
Yeah.

81
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,308
You got anyone you can trust?

82
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,339
Whoa! Easy. Whoa!

83
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,528
It hasn't grown much.

84
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,547
I think it might be a Strand-Cast.

85
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,074
I don't think it was engineered.

86
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,326
I've worked in the gene farms.

87
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,913
This one looks evolved. Too ugly.

88
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:04,378
This one, on the other hand, looks like
she was farmed in the Cytocaves of Nora.

89
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,880
This is Cara Dune.
She was a shock trooper.

90
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,257
You were a Dropper?

91
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,134
Did you serve?

92
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,179
On the other side, I'm afraid.

93
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:18,183
But I'm proud to say
that I paid out my clan's debt,

94
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,228
and now I serve no one but myself.

95
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,234
Would anyone care for some tea?

96
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,405
Please lower your blasters.
He will not harm you.

97
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,350
That thing is programmed to kill the baby.

98
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,993
Not anymore.

99
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,836
It was left behind
in the wake of your destruction.

100
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,095
I found it laying where it fell.

101
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,229
Devoid of all life.

102
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,696
I recovered the flotsam
and staked it as my own

103
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,033
in accordance with
the Charter of the New Republic.

104
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,956
Little remained of its neural harness.

105
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,755
Reconstruction was quite difficult...

106
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,383
...but not impossible.

107
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,598
It had to learn everything from scratch.

108
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,937
This is something that cannot be taught
with the twist of a spanner.

109
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,567
It requires patience and repetition.

110
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,996
I spent day after day
reinforcing its development

111
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,084
with patience and affirmation.

112
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:15,175
It developed a personality
as its experiences grew.

113
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,094
Is it still a hunter?

114
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,412
No. But it will protect.

115
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,298
Tea?

116
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,892
I've run into some problems.

117
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,188
I figured as much.
Why else would you return?

118
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,982
I wanna hire your services.

119
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,859
I'm retired from service.

120
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,028
I can pay you handsomely, Ugnaught.

121
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:20,324
I have a name. It is Kuiil.

122
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,744
I need someone
to protect the little one, Kuiil.

123
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,330
I'm not suited for such work.

124
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,876
I can reprogram IG-11
for nursing and protocol.

125
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,754
No. I don't want
that droid anywhere near him.

126
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,508
Why're you so distrustful of droids?

127
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,027
It tried to kill him.

128
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,802
It was programmed to do so.

129
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,097
Droids are not good or bad.

130
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,809
They are neutral reflections
of those who imprint them.

131
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,145
I've seen otherwise.

132
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,855
Do you trust me?

133
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,233
From what I can tell, yes.

134
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,735
Then you will trust my work.

135
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,698
IG-11 will join me.

136
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,742
And we do it not for payment,

137
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,496
but to protect the child
from Imperial slavery.

138
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:13,377
None will be free
until the old ways are gone forever.

139
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,380
Okay.

140
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,634
And the blurrgs
will join me as well.

141
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,861
The blurrgs?

142
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,262
I have spoken.

143
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,955
I got you, Mando.

144
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:53,292
Care to double the bet?

145
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,976
No! No, no! Stop!

146
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,437
We're friends, we're friends.
Cara is my friend!

147
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,730
That is not okay!

148
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,315
Hmm. Very curious.

149
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,817
Curious? It almost killed me!

150
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:23,322
The story you told me of the mudhorn
now makes more sense.

151
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,950
- What is it?
- What it is, I don't know.

152
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,661
But what it does, this...

153
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,330
This I've heard rumors of.

154
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,624
What? When you worked for the Empire?

155
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:38,462
When I was sold to the Empire,
in indentured servitude.

156
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,714
Yet somehow, you walk free.

157
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,301
I bought my freedom
through the skill of my hands

158
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,764
and the labor of
three of your human lifetimes.

159
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:55,395
Do not cast doubt upon that of what I am
nor whom I shall serve.

160
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,778
Tell you what.
I could really use

161
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,821
your craftwork right now.

162
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,950
Can you pad this
container so the child can sleep better?

163
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,578
I shall fabricate a better one.

164
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,666
Then perhaps this Dropper can see
how one can win their freedom

165
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,544
with the skill of one's hands.

166
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,349
So, we're going to Nevarro?

167
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,434
- Have you ever been?
- No.

168
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,270
We lost a lot of our forces there.

169
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,814
The city's dug in pretty deep.

170
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,440
No cover when you drop in.

171
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,820
It stayed in Empire control
'till the end of the war.

172
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,590
The warlord
we're taking out was an Imperial officer.

173
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,700
- What station?
- Hard to tell.

174
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,285
No insignia anymore.

175
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,871
I took out the safehouse
when I snatched the kid.

176
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,581
More Imps have reinforced since.

177
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,333
There's something more going on.

178
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,128
Maybe.
We'll find out more when we land.

179
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:06,884
I have prepared second meal.
Would you care to be served here or below?

180
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,262
I'm not hungry.

181
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,601
Under no circumstances
does that thing leave the ship.

182
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,061
You got a real thing for droids,
don't you?

183
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,314
I got a real thing for that droid.

184
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,357
The Ugnaught said he rewired it.

185
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,586
That droid was designed to kill things.

186
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,029
I don't care how much wiring he replaced.

187
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,697
It goes against its nature.

188
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,580
Well, it shouldn't be
a long job anyway.

189
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,619
We take out the head Imp,
the rest will run like rats.

190
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,299
Sorry for the remote rendezvous, Mando,

191
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:33,637
but things have gotten complicated
since you were last here.

192
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,228
It appears that introductions
are in order.

193
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,441
It seems we've both provided
a security detail.

194
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,656
I recommend the shock trooper
guards the ship.

195
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,742
These lava fields are lousy with Jawas.

196
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,346
She's coming with me.

197
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:00,747
But the town is now run by ex-Empire.

198
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,376
If a Rebel Dropper is with us,
they'll all get their hackles up.

199
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:06,077
She's coming.

200
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,089
Fine.

201
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,342
Fine.

202
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,803
At least cover your tattoo.

203
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,597
No need to flaunt it.

204
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,766
Now, where is the little one?

205
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:39,620
So, this little bogwing
is what all the fuss was about.

206
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,500
What a precious little creature.

207
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:50,422
I can see why you didn't want to harm
a hair on its wrinkled little head.

208
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:59,515
Well, I'm glad this matter
will be put to rest once and for all.

209
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,438
The sun drops fast on Nevarro.

210
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,358
We can walk for a spell,
camp out at the riverbank,

211
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,361
then make our way into town
at first light.

212
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,753
I guess the little bugger's a carnivore.

213
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,173
Never seen anything like it.

214
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,176
They were ready to pay a king's ransom
for that thing.

215
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:20,971
Must be for some kind
of highfalutin menagerie.

216
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,974
Let's go over the plan again.

217
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,268
We both enter the common house.

218
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,145
We show the client the bait.

219
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,315
We join him at the table.
And you kill him.

220
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,400
Tell me about his reinforcements.

221
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,611
They're all ex-Empire.

222
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:39,072
As soon as they lose their paycheck,
poof, they'll all scatter.

223
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,533
- And what if they don't?
- They will.

224
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,178
That's not good enough.

225
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:46,455
If, for argument's sake,
a few of them don't realize

226
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,499
that I'm their best path
to alternative employment

227
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:55,005
and they elect to react impulsively,
then these three fine Guild Hunters,

228
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,758
along with that
battle-hardened shock trooper,

229
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,302
will cut down anyone who bucks.

230
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,985
How many will there be?

231
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,641
No more than four.

232
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:09,520
He travels with, at most, a Fire Team.

233
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,104
Trust me.

234
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,191
Nothing can go wrong.

235
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,884
No! Let go of her!

236
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,762
Drop her now!

237
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,440
Drop her!

238
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:37,608
He's hurt badly.

239
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:41,195
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine. Ow!

240
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,279
Hold still.

241
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,365
They got you good.

242
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,540
How bad?

243
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,417
Bad.

244
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,919
The poison's spreading fast.

245
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,882
So this... This is how it happens.

246
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,134
Don't be so dramatic.

247
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:07,137
I need another medpac!
Got any other medpacs?

248
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,847
Anyone?

249
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,726
I'm guessing that's a "no".

250
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:16,897
It's still spreading.

251
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,233
This isn't working.

252
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,278
Get this thing outta here.

253
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,738
Wait.

254
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,451
He's trying to eat me.

255
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,000
You think they're having second thoughts?

256
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,249
Could be.

257
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,629
I need your eyes.

258
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,298
I'm watching.

259
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,194
I guess this is it.

260
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,290
There's something you should know.

261
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,717
The plan was to kill you and take the kid.

262
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,055
But after what happened last night,
I couldn't go through with it.

263
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,728
Go on. You can gun me down here and now
and it wouldn't violate the Code.

264
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,481
But if you do,
this child will never be safe.

265
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,732
We'll take our chances.

266
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,569
The Imperial client is obsessed
with obtaining this asset.

267
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:30,072
You tried to run,
but where did it get you?

268
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:31,198
This is ridiculous.

269
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,200
Perhaps you should let him speak.

270
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,578
Listen, we both need
the client to be eliminated.

271
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,206
Let me take the child to him
and then you two...

272
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,809
- No.
- Let's just kill him and get outta here.

273
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,289
He's right.

274
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,715
What are you doing?

275
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,510
As long as the Imp lives,
he'll send hunters after the child.

276
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,678
It's a trap.

277
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,513
- Bring me.
- Bring you?

278
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:58,225
Tell him you captured me.
Get me close to him and I'll kill him.

279
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,812
That's a good idea. Give me your blaster.

280
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,106
This is insane.

281
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,960
- It's the only way.
- Well, I'm coming with you.

282
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,236
No, no, no.
That would make them suspicious.

283
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,154
I don't care. I'm coming.

284
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,259
- Tell them she caught me.
- Fine. Then she can bring the child.

285
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,035
No. The kid goes back in the ship.

286
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,037
But without the child, none of this works!

287
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:21,761
I have a plan.
Kuiil, ride back to the Razor Crest

288
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:23,876
with the child and seal yourself in.

289
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,628
When you're inside,
engage ground security protocols.

290
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,047
Nothing on this planet
will breach those doors.

291
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,300
Here's a comlink.

292
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,635
I will keep the child safe.

293
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,889
Don't forget to cover your stripes.

294
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,098
Let's go.

295
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,660
Chain code?

296
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,329
I have a gift for the boss.

297
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,665
Chain code?

298
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,599
I'll give you 20 credits for the helmet.

299
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:05,853
Ha-ha! Not a chance.
That's going on my wall.

300
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,356
On your wall?

301
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,607
Go with it.

302
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,276
Go ahead.

303
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,704
You said four.

304
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,497
There are more than four troopers.

305
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:29,543
Four guarding the client.
Many more here in town.

306
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:34,464
Things got really heated
once Mando crashed the safehouse.

307
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,800
Slip him his blaster.

308
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:38,844
Not yet.

309
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:00,908
Here we are.

310
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,000
You see? Four.

311
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,222
Look what I brought you. As promised.

312
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,895
What exquisite craftmanship.

313
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:39,905
It is amazing how beautiful beskar can be
when forged by its ancestral artisans.

314
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:48,080
Can I offer you a libation to celebrate
the closing of our shared narrative?

315
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,290
I would be obliged.

316
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,129
Please sit.

317
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:01,635
It is a shame
that your people suffered so.

318
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:06,098
Just as in this situation,
it was all avoidable.

319
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,811
Why did Mandalore resist our expansion?

320
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:15,649
The Empire improves
every system it touches.

321
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,860
Judge by any metric.

322
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:22,990
Safety, prosperity, trade,
opportunity, peace.

323
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,328
Compare Imperial rule
to what is happening now.

324
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,541
Look outside.

325
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:38,088
Is the world more peaceful
since the revolution?

326
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:44,428
I see nothing but death and chaos.

327
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,182
I would like to see the baby.

328
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,475
Uh...

329
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,977
It is asleep.

330
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,021
We all will be quiet.

331
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:59,234
Open the pram.

332
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:12,372
Don't think me to be rude.
I must take this call.

333
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,092
Give me the blaster.

334
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,678
You get one shot.

335
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:29,306
This is bad. You said four.

336
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:33,393
Well, there are more. What can I tell you?

337
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,067
Yes, Moff Gideon?

338
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,069
Have they brought the child?

339
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:45,822
Yes, they have. Currently, it is sleeping.

340
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,325
You may wanna check again.

341
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,090
Four stormtroopers?

342
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,147
This is bad.

343
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,399
Kuiil? Are you back to the ship yet?

344
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:06,111
Are you there? Do you copy?

345
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,196
Yes!

346
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,531
- Are you back to the ship yet?
- Not yet.

347
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:12,242
Get back to the ship and bail.
Get the kid out of here.

348
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:13,619
We're pinned down!

349
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,453
You have something I want.

350
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,372
Who's this guy?

351
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:45,961
You may think you have some idea
of what you are in possession of,

352
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,045
but you do not.

353
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,516
Kuiil, are you back
to the ship yet? They're onto us!

354
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,056
Kuiil, come in!

355
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,811
In a few moments, it will be mine.

356
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,446
Kuiil! Do you copy?

357
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:14,198
Kuiil!

358
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:21,038
It means more to me
than you will ever know.

359
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:23,957
Kuiil! Are you there?

360
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,626
Come in, Kuiil.

361
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,085
Kuiil, come in.

362
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,674
Kuiil? Are you there?

363
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,551
Do you copy?

364
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:36,762
Kuiil?

365
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,515
Kuiil!
