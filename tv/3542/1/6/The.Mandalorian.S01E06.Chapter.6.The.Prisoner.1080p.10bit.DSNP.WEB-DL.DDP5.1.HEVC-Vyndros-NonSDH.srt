1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,380
The kid's with me.

2
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,816
Who's he tracking?

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,901
The kid.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,861
Then they’ll keep coming.

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:28,946
Yes.

6
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,219
Mando.

7
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,807
Is that you under that bucket?

8
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,559
Ran.

9
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,189
I didn't really know
if I'd ever see you in these parts again.

10
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,481
Good to see you.

11
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,067
You know, to be honest,

12
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,362
I was a little surprised
when you reached out to me.

13
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,991
You know, 'cause I... I hear things.

14
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,871
Like, maybe things between you
and the Guild aren't workin' out.

15
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,207
I'll be fine.

16
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,543
Okay. Well, you know the policy.

17
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,253
No questions.

18
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,757
And you, you're welcome back here anytime.

19
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,157
So, what's the job?

20
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:21,725
Yeah, one of our associates ran afoul of
some competitors and got himself caught.

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,769
So, I'm puttin' together
a crew to spring him.

22
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,563
It's a five person job. I got four.

23
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:32,736
All I need is the ride,
and you brought it.

24
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,990
The ship wasn't part of the deal.

25
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,577
Well, the <i>Crest</i> is the only reason
I let you back in here.

26
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,248
What's the look?

27
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,878
Is that gratitude?

28
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,260
Uh-huh. I think it is.

29
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,726
Hey, Mayfeld.

30
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,311
Yeah?

31
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,231
This is Mando,
the guy I was tellin' you about.

32
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,983
We used to do jobs way back when.

33
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,527
This is the guy?

34
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,780
Yeah, we were all young,
tryin' to make a name for ourselves.

35
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,117
Yeah, but runnin'
with a Mandalorian, that was...

36
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,120
That brought us some reputation.

37
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,664
Oh, yeah? What did he get out of it?

38
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,209
I asked him that one time.
You remember what you said, Mando?

39
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,172
Target practice.

40
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,757
Target practice.

41
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,802
We did some crazy stuff, didn't we?

42
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,014
That was a long time ago.

43
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,099
Well...

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,437
Well, I don't go out anymore.
You understand?

45
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,982
So, uh, Mayfeld, he's gonna
run point on this job.

46
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,445
If he says it,
it's like it's comin' from me.

47
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,322
You good with that?

48
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,567
You tell me.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,622
You haven't changed one bit.

50
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,374
Yeah, well,
things have changed around here.

51
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,877
Yeah, well, Mayfeld, he's...

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,838
He's one of the best triggermen
I've ever seen.

53
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,549
Former Imperial sharpshooter.

54
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,942
That's not saying much.

55
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,678
I wasn't a stormtrooper, wiseass.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,436
Don't take long, does it?

57
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,568
<i>Razor Crest?</i>
I can't believe that thing can fly.

58
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,695
Looks like a Canto Bight slot machine.

59
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,950
The good-lookin' fellow there
with the horns, that's Burg.

60
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,872
This may surprise you,
but he's our muscle.

61
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,840
So, this is a Mandalorian.

62
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,135
I thought they'd be bigger.

63
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,513
Droid's name is Zero.

64
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,063
I thought you said you had four.

65
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,356
He does.

66
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,158
Hello, Mando.

67
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,660
Xi'an.

68
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,914
Tell me why I shouldn't cut you down
where you stand?

69
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,834
Nice to see you, too.

70
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,548
I missed you.

71
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,927
This is shiny.

72
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,430
You wear it well.

73
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,642
Do we need to leave the room or something?

74
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,188
Well, Xi'an's been a little heartbroken
since Mando left our group.

75
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,815
Aw. You gonna be okay, sweetheart?

76
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,233
Oh, I'm all business now.

77
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,194
Learned from the best.

78
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,778
All right, lovebirds.

79
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,741
Break it up till you get on the ship.
Right now we don't have much time.

80
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,046
Tiny.

81
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,809
Fuel.

82
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,980
Navigation. Hyperdrive.

83
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,066
Landing gear.

84
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,568
Comms.

85
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,903
<i>Mando...</i>

86
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,572
<i>I received... </i>
<i>I received wonderful news.</i>

87
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,701
<i>Upon your... Upon your...
Deliver the quarry. Deliver the...</i>

88
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:51,995
Hmm.

89
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:58,418
So, the package is being moved
on a fortified transport ship.

90
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,341
Now, we got a limited window to board,
find our friend,

91
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,344
get him out of there
before they make their jump.

92
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,095
That's a New Republic prison ship.

93
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,892
Your man wasn't taken by
a rival syndicate. He was arrested.

94
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,895
So what?

95
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,647
A job is a job.

96
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,108
That's a max security transport

97
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,026
and I'm not looking for that kinda heat.

98
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,779
Well, neither are we.
So just don't mess up.

99
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,409
The good news for you
is the ship is manned by droids.

100
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,704
Still hate the machines, Mando?

101
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,624
Despite recent modifications,
the ship is still quite a mess.

102
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,295
The power lines are leaking,
the navigation is intermittent,

103
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,841
and the hyperdrive is only operating
at 67.3% efficiency.

104
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,386
We have much better ships.
Why are we using this one?

105
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,348
'Cause the <i>Razor Crest</i> is off the old
Imperial and the New Republic grid.

106
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,433
It's a ghost.

107
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,020
Yeah, and we need a ship that can get
close enough to jam New Republic code.

108
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,939
So, when we drop out of hyperspace here,

109
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,609
if we immediately bank
into this kinda attitude,

110
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,278
we should be right in their blind spot,

111
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,699
which will give us just enough time
for your ship to scramble our signal.

112
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,952
It's not possible. Even for the <i>Crest.</i>

113
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,704
That's why he's flyin'.

114
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,001
Mando, I know you're a pretty good pilot,

115
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,128
but we need you on the trigger.
Not on the wheel.

116
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,130
Don't worry, Mandalorian.

117
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:30,385
My response time is quicker than organics.
And I'm smarter, too.

118
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,137
All right. I... Yeah. That's good.

119
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,933
Forgive the programming.
He's a little rough around the edges.

120
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,310
But he is the best.

121
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,687
How can you trust it?

122
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,066
You know me, Mando.
I don't trust anybody.

123
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:52,324
Just like the good old days, Mando. Huh?

124
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,612
Will you sit down?

125
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,879
Calculations complete.

126
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,507
Jumping to hyperspace now.

127
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:55,262
Feel free to join the others.
I will handle it from here.

128
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,545
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay. Okay. Okay, I get it.

129
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,256
I'm a little particular
about my personal space, too.

130
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,217
So, let's just do this job.

131
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,178
We get in, we get out, and you don't have
to see our faces anymore.

132
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,806
Someone tell me
why we even need a Mandalorian.

133
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,434
Well, apparently they're
the greatest warriors in the galaxy.

134
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,394
So they say.

135
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,105
Then why are they all dead?

136
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,527
Well, you flew with him, Xi'an.

137
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,154
Is he as good as they say?

138
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,990
Ask him about the job on Alzoc III.

139
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,827
I did what I had to.

140
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,413
Oh, but you liked it.

141
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,501
See, I know who you really are.

142
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,964
He never takes off the helmet?

143
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,341
This is the Way.

144
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,010
Huh.

145
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,305
I wonder what you look like under there.

146
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,600
Maybe he's a Gungan.

147
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,646
Is that why yousa
don't wanna show your face?

148
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,733
You ever seen his face?

149
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,778
A lady never tells.

150
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,282
Aw. Come on, Mando.
We all gotta trust each other here.

151
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,908
You gotta show us somethin'.

152
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,327
Come on. Just lift the helmet up.

153
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,453
Come on.

154
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,539
Let's all see your eyes.

155
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,253
I'll do it.

156
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,886
Whoa! What is that?

157
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,183
You get lonely up here, buddy? Huh?

158
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,688
Wait a minute. Did you two make that? Huh?

159
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,691
What is it, like a pet or somethin'?

160
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,454
Yeah. Something like that.

161
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,988
Didn't take you for the type.

162
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,117
Maybe that code of yours
has made you soft.

163
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,048
Me, I was never really into pets.

164
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,166
Yeah, I didn't have the temperament.
Patience, you know?

165
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,085
I mean, I tried, but never worked out.

166
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,629
But I'm thinkin'

167
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,425
maybe I'll try again

168
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,637
with this little fella.

169
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,764
Huh?

170
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,024
Dropping out of hyperspace now.

171
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,949
Commencing final approach, now.

172
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,576
Cloaking signal, now.

173
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,668
Engaging coupling now.

174
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,178
<i>Coupling confirmed. We are down.</i>

175
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,973
<i>And relax.</i>

176
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,059
<i>Commence extraction now.</i>

177
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,895
Useless droid didn't even give us
a proper countdown.

178
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,484
Z, are you sure they can't see us?

179
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,862
<i> The</i> Razor Crest <i>is
scrambling our signature</i>

180
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,822
and I am inside the prison system.

181
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,867
It's impressive that this gunship
had survived the Empire

182
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,785
without being impounded.

183
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,288
All right, we got a job to do.
Mando, you're up.

184
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,707
- It's me?
- Always you.

185
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:57,940
Zero.

186
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,276
Get us to the control room.

187
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,998
Sub level three.
Disabling onboard surveillance.

188
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,010
All right, we're on the clock.

189
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,972
When we engage those droids,
they're gonna be all over us.

190
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,415
I know the drill.

191
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,727
Bio trackers activated.

192
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,729
I've got eyes.

193
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,189
All right, let's go.

194
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,842
- I don't like this.
- You always were paranoid.

195
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,928
Is that true, Mando?
Were you always paranoid?

196
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:21,398
Approaching control room.
Make a left at the next juncture.

197
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,754
What? It's just a little mousey.

198
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,358
- Come here, little mousey.
- Burg.

199
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,635
- Mousey, come here. Come here.
- Burg.

200
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,598
No! Burg, what are you doin'?

201
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,807
What?

202
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,521
Intruder alert. Open fire.

203
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,821
We're too exposed here.

204
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,115
If they get a signal out,
it's not gonna matter.

205
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,205
Mando, let's go!
You're supposed to be somethin' special.

206
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,166
I knew it. I knew it!

207
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,599
Make sure you clean up your mess.

208
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,654
It seems your presence
has been detected.

209
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,782
Redirecting security alert
away from your position.

210
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,036
Z, open the door!

211
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,913
<i>But I'm detecting
an organic signature.</i>

212
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,123
Yeah, okay. All right.
Just open the door!

213
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,295
Stop!

214
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,589
Just stop right there.

215
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,792
You put down the blasters right now.

216
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,555
Nice shoes.

217
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,923
Put down your blasters.

218
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,809
Matches his belt.

219
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,607
There were only supposed
to be droids on this ship.

220
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,693
Hang on, hang on.
Let's see here. Uh...

221
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,612
Cell two-two-one.

222
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,990
All right, now for
our well-dressed friend.

223
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,912
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey. Easy. Easy, egghead.

224
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,958
Put that down. Put that down. Come on.

225
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,043
- Easy.
- Put it down now!

226
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,672
Easy. Nobody has
to get hurt here. Just calm down.

227
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,131
What is that thing?

228
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,050
It's a tracking beacon.

229
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,427
He presses that thing, we're all done.

230
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,931
A New Republic attack team will hone in
on that signal and blow us all to hell.

231
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,015
Put it down!

232
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,100
Are you serious?

233
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,268
Yes, I'm serious.

234
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,979
You didn't think we needed to know
that tiny little detail?

235
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,981
I didn't think we'd get to this point.

236
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,274
Yet here we are.

237
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,943
Are you questioning
my managerial style, Xi'an?

238
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,362
No, sir.

239
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,756
Hey. Listen to me.

240
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,866
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, okay?

241
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,826
Look.

242
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,328
- Hey. Put it down.
- Are you crazy?

243
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,572
Put it down.

244
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,206
What's your name?

245
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,937
- It's Davan.
- Davan.

246
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,671
We're not here for you.
We're here for a prisoner.

247
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,508
If you let us go about our job,
you can walk away with your life.

248
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,801
No, he won't.

249
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,886
Hey.

250
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,763
You realize what you're gonna
bring down on us?

251
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,140
You think I care about that?

252
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,225
We're not killing anybody.

253
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,269
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando.

254
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,729
I can't do that.

255
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,064
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando!

256
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,525
Don't.

257
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,576
Would you both just shut up?

258
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,662
Crazy Twi.

259
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,665
I had it under control.

260
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,920
Yeah. Looked like it.

261
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,052
Was that thing blinking before?

262
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:01,887
Was it?

263
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,890
<i>- Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld.</i>
- What?

264
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,226
<i>I've detected
a New Republic distress signal</i>

265
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,894
<i>homing in on your location.</i>

266
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,313
<i>You have approximately 20 minutes.</i>

267
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,815
We only need five.

268
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,568
Let's go, let's go.
Move, move, move!

269
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,734
Z, open it up.

270
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,822
<i>- You have 15 minutes remaining.</i>
- Come on, come on. Open it up!

271
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:09,830
Qin.

272
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:16,295
Funny, the man who left me behind
is now my savior.

273
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,715
Mando.

274
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,556
- Brother!
- Sister.

275
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,309
Attack's on the way.
He's already dead meat. Let's go!

276
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,894
Come on, it's better this way.

277
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,020
You deserve this!

278
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,563
Let's go!

279
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,861
<i>Mando. Mando?</i>

280
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:46,867
<i>I've received your transmission.
I've received your transmission.</i>

281
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,704
<i>Upon your return, deliver the quarry
directly to the client.</i>

282
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,706
<i>- I have no idea...</i>
- Interesting.

283
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:53,916
<i>Zero, we got Qin.</i>

284
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,544
I found some information
on The Mandalorian.

285
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,213
From the Bounty Hunters Guild.

286
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,423
Yeah, do whatever.
Just get us off this ship.

287
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:03,759
<i>You have 10 minutes remaining.</i>

288
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:15,122
<i>- Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld.</i>
- Wait, wait, wait!

289
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,291
- Yeah?
<i>- You have a potential problem.</i>

290
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,917
He has escaped.

291
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,255
- I told you we should've ended him.
- I know!

292
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,048
- This is your fault!
- I know!

293
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,100
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Come on!

294
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,234
- No!
- No!

295
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:47,196
- No!
- Burg! Burg!

296
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:53,243
Zero to Mayfeld.
Mayfeld, do you copy?

297
00:24:56,371 --> 00:25:00,876
It seems comms are no longer functioning,
therefore you cannot hear me.

298
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:02,893
You are on your own.

299
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,050
Curious.

300
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:14,097
It's all right.
You and the Devaronian, split up.

301
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,641
Find Mando and kill him.

302
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,476
Then find a way back to the ship!

303
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,395
Zero! We need a path.

304
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,152
Zero!

305
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,256
Do you have a name?

306
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,340
Mayfeld.

307
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:53,220
Well, Mr. Mayfeld, you're gonna
get me the hell off this ship.

308
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,140
Hey, wait. What about your sister?

309
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:03,981
What about her?

310
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,698
Nice family.

311
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:55,991
Mando always did hate droids.

312
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,953
Z?

313
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,747
Z?

314
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,709
Hey, hey.

315
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:10,005
Whatever Ran promised,
I'll see to it you get triple share.

316
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:14,384
Just get him.

317
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,722
You better be good for it.

318
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,117
Mando.

319
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,856
Where are you, little mouse?

320
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,074
Let's see your face, Mandalorian.

321
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,231
Zero, where is he?

322
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:54,790
What the...

323
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,508
No!

324
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,274
Qin.

325
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:33,120
You killed the others.

326
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,456
They got what they deserved.

327
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:49,595
You kill me, you don't get your money.

328
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:56,143
Whatever Ran promised,
I'll make sure you get it, and more.

329
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,356
Come on, Mando.

330
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,358
Be reasonable.

331
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,194
Huh?

332
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,408
You were hired to do a job, right?

333
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,037
So do it.

334
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,165
Isn't that your code?

335
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,544
Aren't you a man of honor?

336
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,233
Where are the others?

337
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:11,528
No questions asked.
That's the policy, right?

338
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,740
Yeah. That is the policy.

339
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,522
I did the job.

340
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:17,868
Yeah, you did.

341
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,002
Just like the good old days.

342
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:29,505
Yeah, just like the good old days.

343
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:09,878
Kill him.

344
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,360
What's this?

345
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,577
That bastard.

346
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,506
I got a clear signal
on the tracking beacon.

347
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:55,799
Copy that.

348
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,145
Are those X-wings?

349
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:10,898
Yep. That's definitely a tracking beacon.

350
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:12,816
Looks like they're launching a gunship.

351
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:14,234
Copy. Goin' in.

352
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,099
I told you that was a bad idea.
