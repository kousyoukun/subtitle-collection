他在追蹤誰
Who's he tracking?

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,830
孩子
The kid.

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,630
他們不會罷休的
Then they’ll keep coming.

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,880
嗯
Yes.

Mando.

那桶似的頭盔下面是你嗎
Is that you under that bucket?

Ran.

11
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,880
我都不確定
I didn't really know

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
是否還能在這一帶見到你
if I'd ever see you in these parts again.

13
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,500
見到你真好
Good to see you.

14
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,220
說實話
You know, to be honest,

15
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,040
你和我聯系時  我還有點吃驚呢
I was a little surprised when you reached out to me.

16
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,260
因為我...  有所耳聞
You know, 'cause I... I hear things.

17
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,970
好像你和公會搞僵了
Like, maybe things between you and the Guild aren't workin' out.

18
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,010
我不會有事的
I'll be fine.

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,720
好吧  你知道規矩
Okay. Well, you know the policy.

20
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,390
不該問的不問
No questions.

21
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,900
而你呢  隨時歡迎你回這里
And you, you're welcome back here anytime.

22
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,190
是什么活
So, what's the job?

23
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,210
我們的一個手下和競爭者
Yeah, one of our associates ran afoul of

起了爭執  人被抓起來了
some competitors and got himself caught.

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,990
我在組建個團隊去救他
So, I'm puttin' together a crew to spring him.

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,660
五個人的活  我這有四個人
It's a five person job. I got four.

27
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,750
我需要的是交通工具  而你開來了
All I need is the ride, and you brought it.

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,840
飛船不包括在這單生意里
The ship wasn't part of the deal.

29
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,840
我允許你回來都是因為刀鋒之巔
Well, the Crest is the only reason I let you back in here.

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,350
什么表情
What's the look?

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,930
是感恩嗎
Is that gratitude?

32
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,570
我感覺是
Uh-huh. I think it is.

33
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,050
梅菲爾德
Hey, Mayfeld.

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,740
干嘛
Yeah?

35
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,220
這是我和你說過的那個曼達人
This is Mando, the guy I was tellin' you about.

36
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,500
我們曾一起干事  那還是...
We used to do jobs way back when...

37
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,250
就是他啊
This is the guy?

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,930
嗯  那時我們都血氣方剛  想要揚名立萬
Yeah, we were all young, tryin' to make a name for ourselves.

39
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,590
可和一個曼達洛人闖蕩  那...
Yeah, but runnin' with a Mandalorian, that was...

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,110
那確實讓我們有了點名氣
That brought us some reputation.

41
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,930
是嗎  那對他有什么好處
Oh, yeah? What did he get out of it?

42
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,640
我曾經問過他  你還記得你怎么回答的嗎
I asked him that one time. You remember what you said, Mando?

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,640
打靶練習
Target practice.

44
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,190
打靶練習
Target practice.

45
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,110
我們做過些瘋狂事  是不是
We did some crazy stuff, didn't we?

46
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,950
那是很久以前的事了
That was a long time ago.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,820
是啊...
Well...

48
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,450
我不去外面折騰了  你明白嗎
Well, I don't go out anymore. You understand?

49
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,250
所以這個事由梅菲爾德負責
So, uh, Mayfeld, he's gonna run point on this job.

50
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,880
他下的命令就等于是我下的
If he says it, it's like it's comin' from me.

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,170
你沒問題吧
You good with that?

52
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,710
我不知道
You tell me.

53
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,980
你一點都沒變
You haven't changed one bit.

54
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,140
這里的情況已經不同了
Yeah, well, things have changed around here.

55
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,230
梅菲爾德  他...
Yeah, well, Mayfeld, he's...

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,890
他是我見過的最棒的槍手
He's one of the best triggermen I've ever seen.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,940
前帝國的神槍手
Former Imperial sharpshooter.

58
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,730
那也沒什么光彩的
That's not saying much.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
我不是暴風兵  自以為是的家伙
I wasn't a stormtrooper, wiseass.

60
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,870
夠快的  是吧
Don't take long, does it?

61
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,920
刀鋒之巔  這玩意還能飛啊
Razor Crest? I can't believe that thing can fly.

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,000
看著就像坎托拜那里的老虎機一樣
Looks like a Canto Bight slot machine.

63
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,050
那個長角的帥哥叫伯格
The good-lookin' fellow there with the horns, that's Burg.

64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,340
你可能想不到  他是我們的打手
This may surprise you, but he's our muscle.

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,060
這是個曼達洛人
So, this is a Mandalorian.

66
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,610
我以為他們是大塊頭呢
I thought they'd be bigger.

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,530
機器人叫零
Droid's name is Zero.

68
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,200
你不是說你有四個人嗎
I thought you said you had four.

69
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,450
沒錯
He does.

70
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,300
你好  曼達人
Hello, Mando.

71

希安
Xi'an.

72
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,970
給我個理由不就地把你砍翻在地
Tell me why I shouldn't cut you down where you stand?

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,810
見到你我也很高興
Nice to see you, too.

74
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,560
我挺想你
I missed you.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,070
這真亮啊
This is shiny.

76
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,490
你穿著不錯
You wear it well.

77
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,370
我們是不是應該回避一下
Do we need to leave the room or something?

78
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,500
曼達人離開我們的團隊以后
Well, Xi'an's been a little heartbroken

79
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,410
希安有點傷心
since Mando left our group.

80
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,830
你會沒事吧  寶貝
Aw. You gonna be okay, sweetheart?

81
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,370
我現在很一本正經的
Oh, I'm all business now.

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,330
從最好的師傅那學來的
Learned from the best.

83
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,790
好吧  小情侶
All right, lovebirds.

84
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,810
等我們上了飛船你們再膩味吧
Break it up till you get on the ship.

85
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,920
現在我們沒時間
Right now we don't have much time.

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,180

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,550
我得到了好消息
I received... I received wonderful news.

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,760
在你...你的...  遞交獵物...
Upon your... Upon your... Deliver the quarry. Deliver the...

96
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,470
目標正在一艘被加固過的運輸飛船上
So, the package is being moved on a fortified transport ship.

97
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,690
我們只有很短的時間可以登機  找到我們的朋友
Now, we got a limited window to board, find our friend,

98
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,400
在他們進入曲速之前救出他
get him out of there before they make their jump.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,280
這是新共和國的監獄船
That's a New Republic prison ship.

100
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,160
你的人不是被對立集團帶走了  而是被逮捕了
Your man wasn't taken by a rival syndicate. He was arrested.

101
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,030
那又如何
So what?

102
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,790
你已經接下任務了
A job is a job.

103
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,180
這是最高安全級別的運輸艦
That's a max security transport

104
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,040
我不想惹這種麻煩
and I'm not looking for that kinda heat.

105
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,170
我們也不想  所以別搞砸
Well, neither are we. So just don't mess up.

106
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,670
好消息是  這艘飛船是由機器人操控的
The good news for you is the ship is manned by droids.

107
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,860
你還是很討厭機器  對嗎  曼達人
Still hate the machines, Mando?

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,980
雖然最近進行過修整
Despite recent modifications,

109
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,850
這艘飛船的情況還是一團糟
the ship is still quite a mess.

110
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,490
輸電線在漏電  導航系統斷斷續續
The power lines are leaking, the navigation is intermittent,

111
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,110
曲速的運行效率只有67.3%
and the hyperdrive is only operating at 67.3% efficiency.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,610
我們有更好的飛船  為什么還要用這一艘
We have much better ships. Why are we using this one?

113
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,000
因為刀鋒之巔已經脫離了
'Cause the Razor Crest is off

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,780
老帝國和新共和國的監控范圍
the old Imperial and the New Republic grid.

115
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,790
就是一艘影子飛船
It's a ghost.

116
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,670
沒錯  我們需要一艘可以足夠接近監獄船
Yeah, and we need a ship that can get close enough

117
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,330
并且干擾新共和國暗碼的飛船
to jam New Republic code.

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,040
當我們在這里脫離曲速
So, when we drop out of hyperspace here,

119
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,750
我們會立刻達到到這里的海拔
if we immediately bank into this kinda attitude,

120
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,170
應該可以直接進入他們的盲點
we should be right in their blind spot,

121
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,170
這可以給我們爭取足夠的時間
which will give us just enough time

122
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,920
來讓你的飛船隱藏我們的信號
for your ship to scramble our signal.

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,510
這不可能  連刀鋒之巔也做不到
It's not possible. Even for the Crest.

124
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,220
所以才要他來駕駛
That's why he's flyin'.

125
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,200
曼達人  我知道你是個很優秀的飛行員
Mando, I know you're a pretty good pilot,

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,350
但我們需要你執行任務  而不是駕駛飛船
but we need you on the trigger. Not on the wheel.

127
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,310
別擔心  曼達洛人
Don't worry, Mandalorian.

128
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,520
我的反應時間比有機生命體更快
My response time is quicker than organics.

129
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,480
而且我更聰明
And I'm smarter, too.

130
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,650
好了  可以了
All right. I-- Yeah. That's good.

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,280
請原諒  他的程序還是有些不完善
Forgive the programming. He's a little rough around the edges.

132
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,530
但他確實是最出色的
But he is the best.

133
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,490
你怎么能相信它
How can you trust it?

134
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,460
你了解我  曼達人  我不相信任何人
You know me, Mando. I don't trust anybody.

135
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,000
就像過去的美好時光  曼達人  對嗎
Just like the good old days, Mando. Huh?

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
你能坐下嗎
Will you sit down?

137
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,180
計算完成
Calculations complete.

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,190
現在開始進入曲速
Jumping to hyperspace now.

139
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,360
你可以和他們會合了  后面交給我
Feel free to join the others. I will handle it from here.

140
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,730
好了  好了  我明白
Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Okay. Okay, I get it.

141
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,520
我對私人空間也很敏感
I'm a little particular about my personal space, too.

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,370
我們做任務就好
So, let's just do this job.

143
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,450
進去  出來
We get in, we get out,

144
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,280
然后你也不必再見到我們了
and you don't have to see our faces anymore.

145
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,820
告訴我  我們為什么需要曼達洛人
Someone tell me why we even need a Mandalorian.

146
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,660
很顯然  他們是星系最勇猛的戰士
Well, apparently they're the greatest warriors in the galaxy.

147
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,200
別人是這么說的
So they say.

148
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,240
那他們怎么都死了
Then why are they all dead?

149
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,620
你和他一起飛行過  希安
Well, you flew with him, Xi'an.

150
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,960
他和他們說的一樣厲害嗎
Is he as good as they say?

151
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,090
問問他阿爾佐克三號星上的任務
Ask him about the job on Alzoc III.

152
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,010
我做了我必須做的事
I did what I had to.

153
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,720
但你很享受
Oh, but you liked it.

154
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,560
我知道你到底是什么人
See, I know who you really are.

155
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,770
他從沒摘下過頭盔嗎
He never takes off the helmet?

156
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,610
此乃正道
This is the Way.

157
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,360
我很好奇你到底長什么樣
I wonder what you look like under there.

158
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,740
也許他是岡根人
Maybe he's a Gungan.

159
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,080
難道這就是你不愿意露臉的原因
Is that why yousa don't wanna show your face?

160
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,000
你見過他的臉嗎
You ever seen his face?

161
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,170
女人從不泄密
A lady never tells.

162
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,500
曼達人  我們得互相信任
Aw. Come on, Mando. We all gotta trust each other here.

163
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
你總得讓我們見識見識
You gotta show us somethin'.

164
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,920
來吧  把頭盔抬起來
Come on. Just lift the helmet up.

165
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,340
來吧
Come on.

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,720
讓我們看看你的眼睛
Let's all see your eyes.

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,270
我來
I'll do it.

168
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,070
那是什么
Whoa! What is that?

169
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,490
你在這很寂寞嗎  小家伙
You get lonely up here, buddy? Huh?

170
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,830
等等  這是你們倆生的嗎
Wait a minute. Did you two make that? Huh?

171
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,330
這是什么  寵物嗎
What is it, like a pet or somethin'?

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,330
是的  差不多
Yeah. Something like that.

173
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,090
沒看出來你是這種人
Didn't take you for the type.

174
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,210
也許是你的準則讓你心軟了
Maybe that code of yours has made you soft.

175
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,090
我從來就不喜歡寵物
Me, I was never really into pets.

176
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,230
我沒那個耐心
Yeah, I didn't have the temperament. Patience, you know?

177
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,390
我試著養過  也沒什么結果
I mean, I tried, but never worked out.

178
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,560
但我在考慮
But I'm thinkin'

179
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,570
也許我可以試著再養一次這個小家伙
maybe I'll try again with this little fella.

180
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,460
現在開始脫離曲速
Dropping out of hyperspace now.

181
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,420
現在開始最終著陸
Commencing final approach, now.

182
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,920
現在開始隱蔽信號
Cloaking signal, now.

183
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,890
現在準備對接
Engaging coupling now.

184
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,190
對接確認  我們落地了
Coupling confirmed. We are down.

185
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,780
放松
And relax.

186
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,960
開始營救任務
Commence extraction now.

187
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,990
廢物機器人甚至都沒給我們認真倒計時
Useless droid didn't even give us a proper countdown.

188
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,410
零  你確定他們看不到我們嗎
Z, are you sure they can't see us?

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
刀鋒之巔擾亂了我們的信號
The Razor Crest is scrambling our signature

190
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,040
我入侵進了監獄系統
and I am inside the prison system.

191
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,170
這艘炮艦居然幸存了下來
It's impressive that this gunship had survived the Empire

192
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,970
沒有被帝國扣押  真是太厲害了
without being impounded.

193
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,260
好了我們有工作要做  曼達人  該你了
All right, we got a job to do. Mando, you're up.

194
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,220
-是我嗎  -一直都是你
- It's me? - Always you.

195
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,080
零
Zero.

196
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,250
帶我們去控制室
Get us to the control room.

197
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,390
向下三層  正在關閉艦內監控
Sub level three. Disabling onboard surveillance.

198
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,570
好吧  我們時間緊迫
All right, we're on the clock.

199
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,860
當我們和那些機器人交戰時  它們會一擁而上
When we engage those droids, they're gonna be all over us.

200
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,200
我知道這個套路
I know the drill.

201
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,950
生物追蹤器激活
Bio trackers activated.

202
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,910
我有眼睛
I've got eyes.

203
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,160
好吧  我們走
All right, let's go.

204
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,230
-我不喜歡這個感覺  -你總是多疑
- I don't like this. - You always were paranoid.

205
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,070
是真的嗎  曼達人  你總是多疑嗎
Is that true, Mando? Were you always paranoid?

206
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,870
接近控制室  在下一個路口向左拐
Approaching control room. Make a left at the next juncture.

207
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,930
怎么了  只是個小老鼠
What? It's just a little mousey.

208
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,310
-過來  小老鼠  -伯格
- Come here, little mousey. - Burg.

209
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,000
不  伯格  你在干什么
No! Burg, what are you doin'?

210
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,820
怎么了
What?

211
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,580
入侵者警報  開火
Intruder alert. Open fire.

212
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,890
我們這里太暴露了
We're too exposed here.

213
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,800
如果他們發出信號  那就沒關系了
If they get a signal out, it's not gonna matter.

214
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,680
曼達人  上啊  你應該是個狠角色
Mando, let's go! You're supposed to be somethin' special.

215
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,510
我就知道  我就知道
I knew it. I knew it!

216
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,780
記得把你的爛攤子收拾干凈
Make sure you clean up your mess.

217
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,840
看來你們的存在被發現了
It seems your presence has been detected.

218
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,130
將安全警報從你們的位置重移開
Redirecting security alert away from your position.

219
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,920
零  開門
Z, open the door!

220
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,020
但我發現了一個有機體信號
But I'm detecting an organic signature.

221
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,930
行了知道了  把門打開
Yeah, okay. All right. Just open the door!

222
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,230
站住
Stop!

223
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,810
就停在那兒
Just stop right there.

224
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,070
立刻放下槍
You put down the blasters right now.

225
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,360
鞋子不錯
Nice shoes.

226
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,360
放下你的槍
Put down your blasters.

227
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,780
跟他的腰帶很配啊
Matches his belt.

228
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,250
這艘艦上應該只有機器人的
There were only supposed to be droids on this ship.

229
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,080
等等  等等  我們看看
Hang on, hang on. Let's see here. Uh...

230
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,290
二二一號房
Cell two-two-one.

231
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,170
好吧  現在給我們穿著考究的朋友
All right, now for our well-dressed friend.

232
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,880
慢著慢著  放松  蛋頭
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Easy. Easy, egghead.

233
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,150
把它放下  把它放下  快點
Put that down. Put that down. Come on.

234
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,190
放松  快放下
Easy. Put it down now!

235
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,520
放松  不用有人受傷  冷靜
Easy. Nobody has to get hurt here. Just calm down.

236
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,190
那是什么東西
What is that thing?

237
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,060
這是一個跟蹤信標
It's a tracking beacon.

238
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,690
他按那個鍵  我們都得死
He presses that thing, we're all done.

239
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,870
新共和國的攻擊群會循跡而來
A New Republic attack team will hone in on that signal

240
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,150
把我們炸成渣
and blow us all to hell.

241
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,070
放下它
Put it down!

242
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,210
你是認真的嗎
Are you serious?

243
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,290
是的  我是認真的
Yes, I'm serious.

244
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,050
你以為我們不需要知道那個小細節
You didn't think we needed to know that tiny little detail?

245
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,760
我沒想到我們會走到這一步
I didn't think we'd get to this point.

246
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,380
但我們確實走到了
Yet here we are.

247
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,870
你在質疑我的管理風格嗎  希安
Are you questioning my managerial style, Xi'an?

248
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,460
沒有  長官
No, sir.

249
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,000
嘿  聽我說
Hey. Listen to me.

250
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,130
嘿  聽我說  好嗎
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, okay?

251
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,090
聽我說
Look.

252
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,440
-嘿  把槍放下  -你瘋了嗎
- Hey. Put it down. - Are you crazy?

253
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,260
放下槍
put it down.

254
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,050
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

255
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,100
-我是達文  -達文
- It's Davan. - Davan.

256
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,890
我們不是來抓你的  我們是來救犯人的
We're not here for you. We're here for a prisoner.

257
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,770
如果你讓我們完成任務  你可以活著離開
If you let us go about our job, you can walk away with your life.

258
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,610
不  他不會的
No, he won't.

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,900
你知道你會給我們帶來什么嗎
You realize what you're gonna bring down on us?

260
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,110
你覺得我在乎嗎
You think I care about that?

261
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,380
我們不會殺人  懂嗎
We're not killing anybody, you understand?

262
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,070
把槍從我臉上拿開  曼達人
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando.

263
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,370
我不能那樣做
I can't do that.

264
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,580
把槍從我臉上拿開  曼達人
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando!

265
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,120
不要
Don't.

266
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,630
你們都閉嘴好嗎
Would you both just shut up?

267
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,760
瘋狂的老提
Crazy Twi.

268
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,850
我剛才控制住局面了
I had it under control.

269
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,060
真棒  看起來控制住了
Yeah. Looked like it.

270
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,150
那東西以前在閃嗎
Was that thing blinking before?

271
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,070
有嗎
Was it?

272
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,900
-零呼叫梅菲爾德  -怎么了
- Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld. - What?

273
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,500
我發現你們的位置上

你在哪里  小老鼠
Where are you, little mouse?

這不是你的準則嗎

361
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,410
收到  上吧
