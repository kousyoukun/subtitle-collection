1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,450
这孩子跟我走
The kid's coming with me.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,120
《曼达洛人》前情提要

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,620
他在追踪谁
Who's he tracking?

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,830
孩子
The kid.

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,630
他们不会罢休的
Then they’ll keep coming.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,880
嗯
Yes.

7
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:54,080
星球大战

8
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,070
曼达人
Mando.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,070
那桶似的头盔下面是你吗
Is that you under that bucket?

10
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,450
兰恩
Ran.

11
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,880
我都不确定
I didn't really know

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
是否还能在这一带见到你
if I'd ever see you in these parts again.

13
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,500
见到你真好
Good to see you.

14
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,220
说实话
You know, to be honest,

15
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,040
你和我联系时  我还有点吃惊呢
I was a little surprised when you reached out to me.

16
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,260
因为我...  有所耳闻
You know, 'cause I... I hear things.

17
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,970
好像你和公会搞僵了
Like, maybe things between you and the Guild aren't workin' out.

18
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,010
我不会有事的
I'll be fine.

19
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,720
好吧  你知道规矩
Okay. Well, you know the policy.

20
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,390
不该问的不问
No questions.

21
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,900
而你呢  随时欢迎你回这里
And you, you're welcome back here anytime.

22
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,190
是什么活
So, what's the job?

23
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,210
我们的一个手下和竞争者
Yeah, one of our associates ran afoul of

24
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,570
起了争执  人被抓起来了
some competitors and got himself caught.

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,990
我在组建个团队去救他
So, I'm puttin' together a crew to spring him.

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,660
五个人的活  我这有四个人
It's a five person job. I got four.

27
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,750
我需要的是交通工具  而你开来了
All I need is the ride, and you brought it.

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,840
飞船不包括在这单生意里
The ship wasn't part of the deal.

29
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,840
我允许你回来都是因为刀锋之巅
Well, the Crest is the only reason I let you back in here.

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,350
什么表情
What's the look?

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,930
是感恩吗
Is that gratitude?

32
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,570
我感觉是
Uh-huh. I think it is.

33
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,050
梅菲尔德
Hey, Mayfeld.

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,740
干嘛
Yeah?

35
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,220
这是我和你说过的那个曼达人
This is Mando, the guy I was tellin' you about.

36
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,500
我们曾一起干事  那还是...
We used to do jobs way back when...

37
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,250
就是他啊
This is the guy?

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,930
嗯  那时我们都血气方刚  想要扬名立万
Yeah, we were all young, tryin' to make a name for ourselves.

39
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,590
可和一个曼达洛人闯荡  那...
Yeah, but runnin' with a Mandalorian, that was...

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,110
那确实让我们有了点名气
That brought us some reputation.

41
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,930
是吗  那对他有什么好处
Oh, yeah? What did he get out of it?

42
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,640
我曾经问过他  你还记得你怎么回答的吗
I asked him that one time. You remember what you said, Mando?

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,640
打靶练习
Target practice.

44
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,190
打靶练习
Target practice.

45
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,110
我们做过些疯狂事  是不是
We did some crazy stuff, didn't we?

46
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,950
那是很久以前的事了
That was a long time ago.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,820
是啊...
Well...

48
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,450
我不去外面折腾了  你明白吗
Well, I don't go out anymore. You understand?

49
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,250
所以这个事由梅菲尔德负责
So, uh, Mayfeld, he's gonna run point on this job.

50
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,880
他下的命令就等于是我下的
If he says it, it's like it's comin' from me.

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,170
你没问题吧
You good with that?

52
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,710
我不知道
You tell me.

53
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,980
你一点都没变
You haven't changed one bit.

54
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,140
这里的情况已经不同了
Yeah, well, things have changed around here.

55
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,230
梅菲尔德  他...
Yeah, well, Mayfeld, he's...

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,890
他是我见过的最棒的枪手
He's one of the best triggermen I've ever seen.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,940
前帝国的神枪手
Former Imperial sharpshooter.

58
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,730
那也没什么光彩的
That's not saying much.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
我不是暴风兵  自以为是的家伙
I wasn't a stormtrooper, wiseass.

60
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,870
够快的  是吧
Don't take long, does it?

61
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,920
刀锋之巅  这玩意还能飞啊
Razor Crest? I can't believe that thing can fly.

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,000
看着就像坎托拜那里的老虎机一样
Looks like a Canto Bight slot machine.

63
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,050
那个长角的帅哥叫伯格
The good-lookin' fellow there with the horns, that's Burg.

64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,340
你可能想不到  他是我们的打手
This may surprise you, but he's our muscle.

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,060
这是个曼达洛人
So, this is a Mandalorian.

66
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,610
我以为他们是大块头呢
I thought they'd be bigger.

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,530
机器人叫零
Droid's name is Zero.

68
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,200
你不是说你有四个人吗
I thought you said you had four.

69
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,450
没错
He does.

70
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,300
你好  曼达人
Hello, Mando.

71
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,590
希安
Xi'an.

72
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,970
给我个理由不就地把你砍翻在地
Tell me why I shouldn't cut you down where you stand?

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,810
见到你我也很高兴
Nice to see you, too.

74
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,560
我挺想你
I missed you.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,070
这真亮啊
This is shiny.

76
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,490
你穿着不错
You wear it well.

77
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,370
我们是不是应该回避一下
Do we need to leave the room or something?

78
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,500
曼达人离开我们的团队以后
Well, Xi'an's been a little heartbroken

79
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,410
希安有点伤心
since Mando left our group.

80
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,830
你会没事吧  宝贝
Aw. You gonna be okay, sweetheart?

81
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,370
我现在很一本正经的
Oh, I'm all business now.

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,330
从最好的师傅那学来的
Learned from the best.

83
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,790
好吧  小情侣
All right, lovebirds.

84
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,810
等我们上了飞船你们再腻味吧
Break it up till you get on the ship.

85
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,920
现在我们没时间
Right now we don't have much time.

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,180
真小
Tiny.

87
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,400
曼达洛人

88
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,740
第一季  第六集
囚犯

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,620
燃料
Fuel.

90
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,950
导航  曲速
Navigation. Hyperdrive.

91
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,160
起落架
Landing gear.

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,540
通讯装置
Comms.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
曼达人
Mando...

94
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,550
我得到了好消息
I received... I received wonderful news.

95
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,760
在你...你的...  递交猎物...
Upon your... Upon your... Deliver the quarry. Deliver the...

96
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,470
目标正在一艘被加固过的运输飞船上
So, the package is being moved on a fortified transport ship.

97
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,690
我们只有很短的时间可以登机  找到我们的朋友
Now, we got a limited window to board, find our friend,

98
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,400
在他们进入曲速之前救出他
get him out of there before they make their jump.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,280
这是新共和国的监狱船
That's a New Republic prison ship.

100
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,160
你的人不是被对立集团带走了  而是被逮捕了
Your man wasn't taken by a rival syndicate. He was arrested.

101
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,030
那又如何
So what?

102
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,790
你已经接下任务了
A job is a job.

103
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,180
这是最高安全级别的运输舰
That's a max security transport

104
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,040
我不想惹这种麻烦
and I'm not looking for that kinda heat.

105
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,170
我们也不想  所以别搞砸
Well, neither are we. So just don't mess up.

106
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,670
好消息是  这艘飞船是由机器人操控的
The good news for you is the ship is manned by droids.

107
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,860
你还是很讨厌机器  对吗  曼达人
Still hate the machines, Mando?

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,980
虽然最近进行过修整
Despite recent modifications,

109
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,850
这艘飞船的情况还是一团糟
the ship is still quite a mess.

110
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,490
输电线在漏电  导航系统断断续续
The power lines are leaking, the navigation is intermittent,

111
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,110
曲速的运行效率只有67.3%
and the hyperdrive is only operating at 67.3% efficiency.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,610
我们有更好的飞船  为什么还要用这一艘
We have much better ships. Why are we using this one?

113
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,000
因为刀锋之巅已经脱离了
'Cause the Razor Crest is off

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,780
老帝国和新共和国的监控范围
the old Imperial and the New Republic grid.

115
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,790
就是一艘影子飞船
It's a ghost.

116
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,670
没错  我们需要一艘可以足够接近监狱船
Yeah, and we need a ship that can get close enough

117
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,330
并且干扰新共和国暗码的飞船
to jam New Republic code.

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,040
当我们在这里脱离曲速
So, when we drop out of hyperspace here,

119
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,750
我们会立刻达到到这里的海拔
if we immediately bank into this kinda attitude,

120
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,170
应该可以直接进入他们的盲点
we should be right in their blind spot,

121
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,170
这可以给我们争取足够的时间
which will give us just enough time

122
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,920
来让你的飞船隐藏我们的信号
for your ship to scramble our signal.

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,510
这不可能  连刀锋之巅也做不到
It's not possible. Even for the Crest.

124
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,220
所以才要他来驾驶
That's why he's flyin'.

125
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,200
曼达人  我知道你是个很优秀的飞行员
Mando, I know you're a pretty good pilot,

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,350
但我们需要你执行任务  而不是驾驶飞船
but we need you on the trigger. Not on the wheel.

127
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,310
别担心  曼达洛人
Don't worry, Mandalorian.

128
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,520
我的反应时间比有机生命体更快
My response time is quicker than organics.

129
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,480
而且我更聪明
And I'm smarter, too.

130
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,650
好了  可以了
All right. I-- Yeah. That's good.

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,280
请原谅  他的程序还是有些不完善
Forgive the programming. He's a little rough around the edges.

132
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,530
但他确实是最出色的
But he is the best.

133
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,490
你怎么能相信它
How can you trust it?

134
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,460
你了解我  曼达人  我不相信任何人
You know me, Mando. I don't trust anybody.

135
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,000
就像过去的美好时光  曼达人  对吗
Just like the good old days, Mando. Huh?

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
你能坐下吗
Will you sit down?

137
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,180
计算完成
Calculations complete.

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,190
现在开始进入曲速
Jumping to hyperspace now.

139
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,360
你可以和他们会合了  后面交给我
Feel free to join the others. I will handle it from here.

140
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,730
好了  好了  我明白
Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Okay. Okay, I get it.

141
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,520
我对私人空间也很敏感
I'm a little particular about my personal space, too.

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,370
我们做任务就好
So, let's just do this job.

143
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,450
进去  出来
We get in, we get out,

144
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,280
然后你也不必再见到我们了
and you don't have to see our faces anymore.

145
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,820
告诉我  我们为什么需要曼达洛人
Someone tell me why we even need a Mandalorian.

146
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,660
很显然  他们是星系最勇猛的战士
Well, apparently they're the greatest warriors in the galaxy.

147
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,200
别人是这么说的
So they say.

148
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,240
那他们怎么都死了
Then why are they all dead?

149
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,620
你和他一起飞行过  希安
Well, you flew with him, Xi'an.

150
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,960
他和他们说的一样厉害吗
Is he as good as they say?

151
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,090
问问他阿尔佐克三号星上的任务
Ask him about the job on Alzoc III.

152
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,010
我做了我必须做的事
I did what I had to.

153
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,720
但你很享受
Oh, but you liked it.

154
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,560
我知道你到底是什么人
See, I know who you really are.

155
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,770
他从没摘下过头盔吗
He never takes off the helmet?

156
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,610
此乃正道
This is the Way.

157
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,360
我很好奇你到底长什么样
I wonder what you look like under there.

158
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,740
也许他是冈根人
Maybe he's a Gungan.

159
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,080
难道这就是你不愿意露脸的原因
Is that why yousa don't wanna show your face?

160
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,000
你见过他的脸吗
You ever seen his face?

161
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,170
女人从不泄密
A lady never tells.

162
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,500
曼达人  我们得互相信任
Aw. Come on, Mando. We all gotta trust each other here.

163
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
你总得让我们见识见识
You gotta show us somethin'.

164
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,920
来吧  把头盔抬起来
Come on. Just lift the helmet up.

165
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,340
来吧
Come on.

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,720
让我们看看你的眼睛
Let's all see your eyes.

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,270
我来
I'll do it.

168
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,070
那是什么
Whoa! What is that?

169
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,490
你在这很寂寞吗  小家伙
You get lonely up here, buddy? Huh?

170
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,830
等等  这是你们俩生的吗
Wait a minute. Did you two make that? Huh?

171
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,330
这是什么  宠物吗
What is it, like a pet or somethin'?

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,330
是的  差不多
Yeah. Something like that.

173
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,090
没看出来你是这种人
Didn't take you for the type.

174
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,210
也许是你的准则让你心软了
Maybe that code of yours has made you soft.

175
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,090
我从来就不喜欢宠物
Me, I was never really into pets.

176
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,230
我没那个耐心
Yeah, I didn't have the temperament. Patience, you know?

177
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,390
我试着养过  也没什么结果
I mean, I tried, but never worked out.

178
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,560
但我在考虑
But I'm thinkin'

179
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,570
也许我可以试着再养一次这个小家伙
maybe I'll try again with this little fella.

180
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,460
现在开始脱离曲速
Dropping out of hyperspace now.

181
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,420
现在开始最终着陆
Commencing final approach, now.

182
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,920
现在开始隐蔽信号
Cloaking signal, now.

183
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,890
现在准备对接
Engaging coupling now.

184
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,190
对接确认  我们落地了
Coupling confirmed. We are down.

185
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,780
放松
And relax.

186
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,960
开始营救任务
Commence extraction now.

187
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,990
废物机器人甚至都没给我们认真倒计时
Useless droid didn't even give us a proper countdown.

188
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,410
零  你确定他们看不到我们吗
Z, are you sure they can't see us?

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
刀锋之巅扰乱了我们的信号
The Razor Crest is scrambling our signature

190
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,040
我入侵进了监狱系统
and I am inside the prison system.

191
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,170
这艘炮舰居然幸存了下来
It's impressive that this gunship had survived the Empire

192
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,970
没有被帝国扣押  真是太厉害了
without being impounded.

193
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,260
好了我们有工作要做  曼达人  该你了
All right, we got a job to do. Mando, you're up.

194
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,220
-是我吗  -一直都是你
- It's me? - Always you.

195
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,080
零
Zero.

196
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,250
带我们去控制室
Get us to the control room.

197
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,390
向下三层  正在关闭舰内监控
Sub level three. Disabling onboard surveillance.

198
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,570
好吧  我们时间紧迫
All right, we're on the clock.

199
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,860
当我们和那些机器人交战时  它们会一拥而上
When we engage those droids, they're gonna be all over us.

200
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,200
我知道这个套路
I know the drill.

201
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,950
生物追踪器激活
Bio trackers activated.

202
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,910
我有眼睛
I've got eyes.

203
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,160
好吧  我们走
All right, let's go.

204
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,230
-我不喜欢这个感觉  -你总是多疑
- I don't like this. - You always were paranoid.

205
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,070
是真的吗  曼达人  你总是多疑吗
Is that true, Mando? Were you always paranoid?

206
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,870
接近控制室  在下一个路口向左拐
Approaching control room. Make a left at the next juncture.

207
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,930
怎么了  只是个小老鼠
What? It's just a little mousey.

208
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,310
-过来  小老鼠  -伯格
- Come here, little mousey. - Burg.

209
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,000
不  伯格  你在干什么
No! Burg, what are you doin'?

210
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,820
怎么了
What?

211
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,580
入侵者警报  开火
Intruder alert. Open fire.

212
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,890
我们这里太暴露了
We're too exposed here.

213
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,800
如果他们发出信号  那就没关系了
If they get a signal out, it's not gonna matter.

214
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,680
曼达人  上啊  你应该是个狠角色
Mando, let's go! You're supposed to be somethin' special.

215
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,510
我就知道  我就知道
I knew it. I knew it!

216
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,780
记得把你的烂摊子收拾干净
Make sure you clean up your mess.

217
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,840
看来你们的存在被发现了
It seems your presence has been detected.

218
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,130
将安全警报从你们的位置重移开
Redirecting security alert away from your position.

219
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,920
零  开门
Z, open the door!

220
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,020
但我发现了一个有机体信号
But I'm detecting an organic signature.

221
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,930
行了知道了  把门打开
Yeah, okay. All right. Just open the door!

222
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,230
站住
Stop!

223
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,810
就停在那儿
Just stop right there.

224
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,070
立刻放下枪
You put down the blasters right now.

225
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,360
鞋子不错
Nice shoes.

226
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,360
放下你的枪
Put down your blasters.

227
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,780
跟他的腰带很配啊
Matches his belt.

228
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,250
这艘舰上应该只有机器人的
There were only supposed to be droids on this ship.

229
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,080
等等  等等  我们看看
Hang on, hang on. Let's see here. Uh...

230
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,290
二二一号房
Cell two-two-one.

231
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,170
好吧  现在给我们穿着考究的朋友
All right, now for our well-dressed friend.

232
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,880
慢着慢着  放松  蛋头
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Easy. Easy, egghead.

233
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,150
把它放下  把它放下  快点
Put that down. Put that down. Come on.

234
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,190
放松  快放下
Easy. Put it down now!

235
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,520
放松  不用有人受伤  冷静
Easy. Nobody has to get hurt here. Just calm down.

236
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,190
那是什么东西
What is that thing?

237
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,060
这是一个跟踪信标
It's a tracking beacon.

238
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,690
他按那个键  我们都得死
He presses that thing, we're all done.

239
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,870
新共和国的攻击群会循迹而来
A New Republic attack team will hone in on that signal

240
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,150
把我们炸成渣
and blow us all to hell.

241
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,070
放下它
Put it down!

242
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,210
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

243
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,290
是的  我是认真的
Yes, I'm serious.

244
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,050
你以为我们不需要知道那个小细节
You didn't think we needed to know that tiny little detail?

245
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,760
我没想到我们会走到这一步
I didn't think we'd get to this point.

246
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,380
但我们确实走到了
Yet here we are.

247
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,870
你在质疑我的管理风格吗  希安
Are you questioning my managerial style, Xi'an?

248
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,460
没有  长官
No, sir.

249
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,000
嘿  听我说
Hey. Listen to me.

250
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,130
嘿  听我说  好吗
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, okay?

251
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,090
听我说
Look.

252
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,440
-嘿  把枪放下  -你疯了吗
- Hey. Put it down. - Are you crazy?

253
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,260
放下枪
put it down.

254
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,050
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

255
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,100
-我是达文  -达文
- It's Davan. - Davan.

256
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,890
我们不是来抓你的  我们是来救犯人的
We're not here for you. We're here for a prisoner.

257
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,770
如果你让我们完成任务  你可以活着离开
If you let us go about our job, you can walk away with your life.

258
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,610
不  他不会的
No, he won't.

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,900
你知道你会给我们带来什么吗
You realize what you're gonna bring down on us?

260
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,110
你觉得我在乎吗
You think I care about that?

261
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,380
我们不会杀人  懂吗
We're not killing anybody, you understand?

262
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,070
把枪从我脸上拿开  曼达人
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando.

263
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,370
我不能那样做
I can't do that.

264
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,580
把枪从我脸上拿开  曼达人
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando!

265
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,120
不要
Don't.

266
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,630
你们都闭嘴好吗
Would you both just shut up?

267
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,760
疯狂的老提
Crazy Twi.

268
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,850
我刚才控制住局面了
I had it under control.

269
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,060
真棒  看起来控制住了
Yeah. Looked like it.

270
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,150
那东西以前在闪吗
Was that thing blinking before?

271
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,070
有吗
Was it?

272
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,900
-零呼叫梅菲尔德  -怎么了
- Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld. - What?

273
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,500
我发现你们的位置上
I've detected a New Republic distress signal

274
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,950
有一个新共和国求救信号
homing in on your location.

275
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,580
你大概有20分钟
You have approximately 20 minutes.

276
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,870
我们只需5分钟
We only need five.

277
