1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,450
The kid's coming with me.

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,620
Who's he tracking?

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,830
The kid.

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,630
Then they’ll keep coming.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,880
Yes.

8
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,070
Mando.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,070
Is that you under that bucket?

10
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,450
Ran.

11
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,880
I didn't really know

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
if I'd ever see you in these parts again.

13
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,500
Good to see you.

14
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,220
You know, to be honest,

15
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,040
I was a little surprised when you reached out to me.

16
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,260
You know, 'cause I... I hear things.

17
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,970
Like, maybe things between you and the Guild aren't workin' out.

18
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,010
I'll be fine.

19
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,720
Okay. Well, you know the policy.

20
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,390
No questions.

21
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,900
And you, you're welcome back here anytime.

22
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,190
So, what's the job?

23
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,210
Yeah, one of our associates ran afoul of

24
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,570
some competitors and got himself caught.

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,990
So, I'm puttin' together a crew to spring him.

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,660
It's a five person job. I got four.

27
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,750
All I need is the ride, and you brought it.

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,840
The ship wasn't part of the deal.

29
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,840
Well, the Crest is the only reason I let you back in here.

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,350
What's the look?

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,930
Is that gratitude?

32
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,570
Uh-huh. I think it is.

33
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,050
Hey, Mayfeld.

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,740
Yeah?

35
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,220
This is Mando, the guy I was tellin' you about.

36
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,500
We used to do jobs way back when...

37
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,250
This is the guy?

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,930
Yeah, we were all young, tryin' to make a name for ourselves.

39
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,590
Yeah, but runnin' with a Mandalorian, that was...

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,110
That brought us some reputation.

41
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,930
Oh, yeah? What did he get out of it?

42
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,640
I asked him that one time. You remember what you said, Mando?

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,640
Target practice.

44
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,190
Target practice.

45
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,110
We did some crazy stuff, didn't we?

46
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,950
That was a long time ago.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,820
Well...

48
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,450
Well, I don't go out anymore. You understand?

49
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,250
So, uh, Mayfeld, he's gonna run point on this job.

50
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,880
If he says it, it's like it's comin' from me.

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,170
You good with that?

52
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,710
You tell me.

53
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,980
You haven't changed one bit.

54
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,140
Yeah, well, things have changed around here.

55
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,230
Yeah, well, Mayfeld, he's...

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,890
He's one of the best triggermen I've ever seen.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,940
Former Imperial sharpshooter.

58
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,730
That's not saying much.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
I wasn't a stormtrooper, wiseass.

60
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,870
Don't take long, does it?

61
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,920
Razor Crest? I can't believe that thing can fly.

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,000
Looks like a Canto Bight slot machine.

63
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,050
The good-lookin' fellow there with the horns, that's Burg.

64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,340
This may surprise you, but he's our muscle.

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,060
So, this is a Mandalorian.

66
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,610
I thought they'd be bigger.

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,530
Droid's name is Zero.

68
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,200
I thought you said you had four.

69
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,450
He does.

70
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,300
Hello, Mando.

71
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,590
Xi'an.

72
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,970
Tell me why I shouldn't cut you down where you stand?

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,810
Nice to see you, too.

74
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,560
I missed you.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,070
This is shiny.

76
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,490
You wear it well.

77
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,370
Do we need to leave the room or something?

78
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,500
Well, Xi'an's been a little heartbroken

79
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,410
since Mando left our group.

80
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,830
Aw. You gonna be okay, sweetheart?

81
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,370
Oh, I'm all business now.

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,330
Learned from the best.

83
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,790
All right, lovebirds.

84
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,810
Break it up till you get on the ship.

85
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,920
Right now we don't have much time.

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,180
Tiny.

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,620
Fuel.

90
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,950
Navigation. Hyperdrive.

91
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,160
Landing gear.

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,540
Comms.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
Mando...

94
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,550
I received... I received wonderful news.

95
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,760
Upon your... Upon your... Deliver the quarry. Deliver the...

96
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,470
So, the package is being moved on a fortified transport ship.

97
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,690
Now, we got a limited window to board, find our friend,

98
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,400
get him out of there before they make their jump.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,280
That's a New Republic prison ship.

100
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,160
Your man wasn't taken by a rival syndicate. He was arrested.

101
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,030
So what?

102
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,790
A job is a job.

103
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,180
That's a max security transport

104
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,040
and I'm not looking for that kinda heat.

105
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,170
Well, neither are we. So just don't mess up.

106
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,670
The good news for you is the ship is manned by droids.

107
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,860
Still hate the machines, Mando?

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,980
Despite recent modifications,

109
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,850
the ship is still quite a mess.

110
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,490
The power lines are leaking, the navigation is intermittent,

111
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,110
and the hyperdrive is only operating at 67.3% efficiency.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,610
We have much better ships. Why are we using this one?

113
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,000
'Cause the Razor Crest is off

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,780
the old Imperial and the New Republic grid.

115
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,790
It's a ghost.

116
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,670
Yeah, and we need a ship that can get close enough

117
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,330
to jam New Republic code.

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,040
So, when we drop out of hyperspace here,

119
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,750
if we immediately bank into this kinda attitude,

120
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,170
we should be right in their blind spot,

121
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,170
which will give us just enough time

122
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,920
for your ship to scramble our signal.

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,510
It's not possible. Even for the Crest.

124
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,220
That's why he's flyin'.

125
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,200
Mando, I know you're a pretty good pilot,

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,350
but we need you on the trigger. Not on the wheel.

127
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,310
Don't worry, Mandalorian.

128
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,520
My response time is quicker than organics.

129
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,480
And I'm smarter, too.

130
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,650
All right. I-- Yeah. That's good.

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,280
Forgive the programming. He's a little rough around the edges.

132
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,530
But he is the best.

133
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,490
How can you trust it?

134
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,460
You know me, Mando. I don't trust anybody.

135
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,000
Just like the good old days, Mando. Huh?

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
Will you sit down?

137
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,180
Calculations complete.

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,190
Jumping to hyperspace now.

139
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,360
Feel free to join the others. I will handle it from here.

140
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,730
Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Okay. Okay, I get it.

141
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,520
I'm a little particular about my personal space, too.

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,370
So, let's just do this job.

143
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,450
We get in, we get out,

144
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,280
and you don't have to see our faces anymore.

145
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,820
Someone tell me why we even need a Mandalorian.

146
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,660
Well, apparently they're the greatest warriors in the galaxy.

147
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,200
So they say.

148
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,240
Then why are they all dead?

149
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,620
Well, you flew with him, Xi'an.

150
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,960
Is he as good as they say?

151
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,090
Ask him about the job on Alzoc III.

152
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,010
I did what I had to.

153
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,720
Oh, but you liked it.

154
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,560
See, I know who you really are.

155
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,770
He never takes off the helmet?

156
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,610
This is the Way.

157
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,360
I wonder what you look like under there.

158
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,740
Maybe he's a Gungan.

159
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,080
Is that why yousa don't wanna show your face?

160
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,000
You ever seen his face?

161
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,170
A lady never tells.

162
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,500
Aw. Come on, Mando. We all gotta trust each other here.

163
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
You gotta show us somethin'.

164
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,920
Come on. Just lift the helmet up.

165
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,340
Come on.

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,720
Let's all see your eyes.

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,270
I'll do it.

168
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,070
Whoa! What is that?

169
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,490
You get lonely up here, buddy? Huh?

170
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,830
Wait a minute. Did you two make that? Huh?

171
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,330
What is it, like a pet or somethin'?

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,330
Yeah. Something like that.

173
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,090
Didn't take you for the type.

174
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,210
Maybe that code of yours has made you soft.

175
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,090
Me, I was never really into pets.

176
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,230
Yeah, I didn't have the temperament. Patience, you know?

177
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,390
I mean, I tried, but never worked out.

178
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,560
But I'm thinkin'

179
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,570
maybe I'll try again with this little fella.

180
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,460
Dropping out of hyperspace now.

181
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,420
Commencing final approach, now.

182
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,920
Cloaking signal, now.

183
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,890
Engaging coupling now.

184
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,190
Coupling confirmed. We are down.

185
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,780
And relax.

186
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,960
Commence extraction now.

187
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,990
Useless droid didn't even give us a proper countdown.

188
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,410
Z, are you sure they can't see us?

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
The Razor Crest is scrambling our signature

190
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,040
and I am inside the prison system.

191
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,170
It's impressive that this gunship had survived the Empire

192
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,970
without being impounded.

193
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,260
All right, we got a job to do. Mando, you're up.

194
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,220
- It's me? - Always you.

195
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,080
Zero.

196
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,250
Get us to the control room.

197
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,390
Sub level three. Disabling onboard surveillance.

198
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,570
All right, we're on the clock.

199
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,860
When we engage those droids, they're gonna be all over us.

200
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,200
I know the drill.

201
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,950
Bio trackers activated.

202
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,910
I've got eyes.

203
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,160
All right, let's go.

204
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,230
- I don't like this. - You always were paranoid.

205
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,070
Is that true, Mando? Were you always paranoid?

206
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,870
Approaching control room. Make a left at the next juncture.

207
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,930
What? It's just a little mousey.

208
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,310
- Come here, little mousey. - Burg.

209
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,000
No! Burg, what are you doin'?

210
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,820
What?

211
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,580
Intruder alert. Open fire.

212
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,890
We're too exposed here.

213
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,800
If they get a signal out, it's not gonna matter.

214
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,680
Mando, let's go! You're supposed to be somethin' special.

215
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,510
I knew it. I knew it!

216
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,780
Make sure you clean up your mess.

217
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,840
It seems your presence has been detected.

218
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,130
Redirecting security alert away from your position.

219
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,920
Z, open the door!

220
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,020
But I'm detecting an organic signature.

221
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,930
Yeah, okay. All right. Just open the door!

222
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,230
Stop!

223
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,810
Just stop right there.

224
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,070
You put down the blasters right now.

225
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,360
Nice shoes.

226
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,360
Put down your blasters.

227
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,780
Matches his belt.

228
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,250
There were only supposed to be droids on this ship.

229
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,080
Hang on, hang on. Let's see here. Uh...

230
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,290
Cell two-two-one.

231
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,170
All right, now for our well-dressed friend.

232
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Easy. Easy, egghead.

233
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,150
Put that down. Put that down. Come on.

234
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,190
Easy. Put it down now!

235
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,520
Easy. Nobody has to get hurt here. Just calm down.

236
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,190
What is that thing?

237
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,060
It's a tracking beacon.

238
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,690
He presses that thing, we're all done.

239
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,870
A New Republic attack team will hone in on that signal

240
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,150
and blow us all to hell.

241
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,070
Put it down!

242
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,210
Are you serious?

243
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,290
Yes, I'm serious.

244
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,050
You didn't think we needed to know that tiny little detail?

245
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,760
I didn't think we'd get to this point.

246
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,380
Yet here we are.

247
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,870
Are you questioning my managerial style, Xi'an?

248
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,460
No, sir.

249
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,000
Hey. Listen to me.

250
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,130
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, okay?

251
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,090
Look.

252
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,440
- Hey. Put it down. - Are you crazy?

253
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,260
put it down.

254
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,050
What's your name?

255
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,100
- It's Davan. - Davan.

256
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,890
We're not here for you. We're here for a prisoner.

257
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,770
If you let us go about our job, you can walk away with your life.

258
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,610
No, he won't.

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,900
You realize what you're gonna bring down on us?

260
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,110
You think I care about that?

261
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,380
We're not killing anybody, you understand?

262
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,070
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando.

263
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,370
I can't do that.

264
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,580
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando!

265
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,120
Don't.

266
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,630
Would you both just shut up?

267
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,760
Crazy Twi.

268
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,850
I had it under control.

269
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,060
Yeah. Looked like it.

270
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,150
Was that thing blinking before?

271
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,070
Was it?

272
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,900
- Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld. - What?

273
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,500
I've detected a New Republic distress signal

274
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,950
homing in on your location.

275
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,580
You have approximately 20 minutes.

276
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,870
We only need five.

277
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,710
Let's go, let's go. Move, move, move!

278
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,790
Z, open it up.

279
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,140
- You have 15 minutes remaining. - Come on, come on.

280
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,920
Open it up!

281
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,010
Qin.

282
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,350
Funny, the man who left me behind is now my savior.

283
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,270
Mando.

284
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,780
- Brother! - Sister.

285
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,420
Attack's on the way. He's already dead meat. Let's go!

286
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,950
Come on, it's better this way.

287
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,130
You deserve this!

288
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,200
Let's go!

289
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,000
Mando. Mando?

290
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,340
I've received your transmission.

291
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,190
I've received your transmission.

292
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,050
Upon your return, deliver the quarry directly to the client.

293
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,890
Interesting.

294
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,930
Zero, we got Qin.

295
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,860
I found some information on The Mandalorian.

296
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,660
From the Bounty Hunters Guild.

297
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,410
Yeah, do whatever. Just get us off this ship.

298
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,110
You have 10 minutes remaining.

299
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,930
- Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld. - Wait, wait, wait!

300
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,720
- Yeah? - You have a potential problem.

301
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,390
He has escaped.

302
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,320
- I told you we should've ended him. - I know!

303
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,190
- This is your fault! - I know!

304
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,280
- Go! Go, go, go! - Come on!

305
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,290
- No! - No!

306
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,330
No! Burg! Burg!

307
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,510
Zero to Mayfeld. Mayfeld, do you copy?

308
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,180
It seems comms are no longer functioning,

309
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,010
therefore you cannot hear me.

310
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,770
You are on your own.

311
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,190
Curious.

312
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,280
It's all right. You and the Devaronian, split up.

313
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,860
Find Mando and kill him.

314
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,570
Then find a way back to the ship!

315
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,580
Zero! We need a path.

316
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,080
Zero!

317
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,390
Do you have a name?

318
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,350
Mayfeld.

319
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,480
Well, Mr. Mayfeld, you're gonna get me the hell off this ship.

320
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,280
Hey, wait. What about your sister?

321
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,120
What about her?

322
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,750
Nice family.

323
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,840
Mando always did hate droids.

324
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,510
Z?

325
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,880
Z?

326
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,480
Whatever Ran promised, I'll see to it you get triple share.

327
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,310
Just get him.

328
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,780
You better be good for it.

329
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,510
Mando.

330
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,160
Where are you, little mouse?

331
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,340
Let's see your face, Mandalorian.

332
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,540
Zero, where is he?

333
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,970
What the...

334
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,810
No!

335
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,160
Qin.

336
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,420
You killed the others.

337
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,220
They got what they deserved.

338
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,940
You kill me, you don't get your money.

339
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,450
Whatever Ran promised, I'll make sure you get it, and more.

340
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,280
Come on, Mando.

341
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,450
Be reasonable.

342
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,550
You were hired to do a job, right?

343
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,300
So do it.

344
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,510
Isn't that your code?

345
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,640
Aren't you a man of honor?

346
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,410
Where are the others?

347
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,960
No questions asked. That's the policy, right?

348
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,840
Yeah. That is the policy.

349
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,630
I did the job.

350
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,010
Yeah, you did.

351
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,850
Just like the good old days.

352
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,480
Yeah, just like the good old days.

353
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,770
Kill him.

354
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,580
What's this?

355
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,630
That bastard.

356
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,850
I got a clear signal on the tracking beacon.

357
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,980
Copy that.

358
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,530
Are those X-wings?

359
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,120
Yep. That's definitely a tracking beacon.

360
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,160
Looks like they're launching a gunship.

361
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,410
Copy. Goin' in.

362
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,490
I told you that was a bad idea.
