I'm surprised you waited.

I'm surprised you took so long.

175
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,124
Is it still sleeping?

176
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,169
THE MANDALORIAN: Yes.

177
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,130
Was it injured?

178
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:46,545
THE MANDALORIAN: I don't think so.
Not physically.

I still don't understand what happened.

THE MANDALORIAN: Neither do I.

There's no way we're gonna get this to
work without a full maintenance facility.

This is gonna take days to fix.

I can't thank you enough.

Please allow me to give you
a portion of the reward.

194

I cannot accept.

You are my guest
