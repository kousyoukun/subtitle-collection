还有一单生意
There is one job.

黑道
Underworld?

面谈
Face to face.

10
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,850
赏金猎人是个复杂的行当
Bounty hunting is a complicated profession.

前情回顾
曼达洛人

18
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,860
我的飞船被毁了  我被困在这了
My ship has been destroyed. I'm trapped here.

那些是我的零件  是他们从我这偷走的
These are my parts. They stole them from me.

24
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,150
你可以交易
You can trade.

25
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,130
那我们要蛋  把蛋给我们带过来

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,590
蛋  什么蛋
The egg? What egg?

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,130
曼鞑  我收到了你的信息  绝好的消息
Mando. I've received your transmission. Wonderful news.

29
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,890
回来的时候  把猎物直接给客户
Upon your return, deliver the quarry directly to the client.

30
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,180
我不清楚他想要把这东西吃掉  还是挂在墙上
I have no idea if he wants to eat it or hang it on his wall,

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,230
但是他非常焦虑
but he's very antsy.

32
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,860
一路平安  你知道在哪找我
Safe passage! You know where to find me.

33
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,570
这可不是玩具
It's not a toy.

34
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,190
小心点
Easy with that.

35
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,320
你别这么紧张
You take it easy.

36
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,470
太好了
Yes!

37
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,330
太好了  太好了  太好了
Yes, yes, yes!

38
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,170
太好了
Yes.

39
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,260
非常健康  太好了
Very healthy. Yes.

40
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,420
你真是名符其实
Your reputation was not unwarranted.

41
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,060
你把这活儿派给了多少人
How many fobs did you give out?

42
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,900
这物品对我来说极为重要
This asset was of extreme importance to me.

43
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,160
我要确保万无一失
I had to ensure its delivery.

44
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,310
不过胜者
But to the winner...

45
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,120
获得战利品
Go the spoils.

46
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,020
这么小的东西就值这么多赏金
Such a large bounty for such a small package.

47
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,750
你计划怎么处理它
What are your plans for it?

48
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,800
你在同类里还真是异乎寻常啊
How uncharacteristic of one of your reputation.

49
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,010
你既收了佣金  又收了报酬
You have taken both commission and payment.

50
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,390
忘记这些事情不正是行会准则吗
Is it not the Code of the Guild that these events are now forgotten?

51
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,110
这些贝斯卡足以使你的盔甲焕然一新了
That Beskar is enough to make a handsome replacement for your armor.

52
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,530
真可惜  在这艰苦岁月里找一个曼达洛人
Unfortunately, finding a Mandalorian in these trying times

53
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,870
可比找这些钢铁难多了
is more difficult than finding the steel.

54
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,420
曼达洛人

55
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,640
第三章
原 罪

56
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,970
这数量可以用来打造很多不同的东西
This amount can be shaped many ways.

57
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,100
我的护甲没法用了  可能得弄套新的
My armor has lost its integrity. I may need to begin again.

58
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,090
确实  我可以打造全套胸甲
Indeed. I can form a full cuirass.

59
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,610
它将与你现在的地位相称
This would be in order for your station.

60
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,950
无比荣幸
That would be a great honor.

61
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,240
必须警告你一下  这很引人注目
I must warn you. It will draw many eyes.

62
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240
（注：这个曼达洛人叫帕兹·维兹拉（Paz Vizla））

63
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,940
这些是帝国冶金厂里铸造的
These were cast in an Imperial smelter.

64
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,000
是大清洗的赃物
These are the spoils of the Great Purge.

65
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,630
也是我们像沙鼠一样东躲西藏的原因
The reason that we live hidden like sand rats.

66
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,540
我们的秘密是幸存  我们的幸存是优势
Our secrecy is our survival. Our survival is our strength.

67
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,890
我们的优势曾是数量
Our strength was once in our numbers.

68
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,150
现在我们活在阴影里  一次一个从地里钻出来
Now we live in the shadows and only come above ground one at a time.

69
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,950
我们的世界被帝国撕得粉碎  这个软蛋还和他们拼桌
Our world was shattered by the Empire, with whom this coward shares tables.

70
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,420
帝国已不复存在
The Empire is no longer.

71
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,130
贝斯卡也回归了
And the Beskar has returned.

72
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,060
当你们选择曼达洛之道时
When one chooses to walk the Way of the Mandalore,

73
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,980
你们既是猎手又是猎物
you are both hunter and prey.

74
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,690
选择这条生活之道的人怎么会是软蛋？
How can one be a coward if one chooses this way of life?

75
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,270
你摘下过自己的头盔吗？
Have you ever removed your helmet?

76
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,030
没有
No.

77
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,490
它被其他人摘下来过吗？
Has it ever been removed by others?

78
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,610
从未
Never.

79
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,580
正是此道
This is the Way.

80
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,410
正是此道
This is the Way.

81
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,370
正是此道
This is the Way.

82
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,290
这是被什么弄坏的
What caused this damage?

83
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,460
泥角兽
A Mudhorn.

84
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,220
那你挣得了泥角兽作为私章
Then you have earned the Mudhorn as your signet.

85
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,300
我会把它刻上去
I shall craft it.

86
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,930
我不能接受  那次击杀不光彩
I can't accept. It wasn't a noble kill.

87
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,520
有个敌人帮了我
I was helped by an enemy.

88
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,520
为什么敌人要在战斗中帮你
Why would an enemy help you in battle?

89
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,880
它不知我与它为敌
It did not know it was my enemy.

90
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,280
既然你拒绝私章
Since you forgo a signet,

91
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,370
我将用余料为你打造一副口哨鸟
I shall use the excess to forge whistling birds.

92
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,660
口哨鸟很不错
Whistling birds will do well.

93
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,290
留一些给弃儿
Reserve some for the foundlings.

94
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,630
一向如此  弃儿即是未来
As it should always be. The foundlings are the future.

95
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,170
正是此道
This is the Way.

96
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,050
正是此道
This is the Way.

97
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,970
正是此道
This is the Way.

98
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,250
口哨鸟是用来应对多名敌人的强大防御武器
Whistling birds are a powerful defense against multiple enemies.

99
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,460
它们十分珍贵  请务必珍惜
Use them sparingly, for they are rare.

100
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,280
（注：天上飞过的是HMP机器人炮艇）

101
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,240
（注：这是一个B2战斗机器人）

102
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,030
听着  我告诉过你  我对你的借口毫无兴趣
Look, I told you. I'm not interested in your excuses!

103
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,840
你有过机会  废物  但你未能把握
You had your shot, dust breather, but you failed.

104
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,470
我不会给你定标器  滚出去
No pucks for you. Now get outta here.

105
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,420
曼鞑
Mando!

106
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,630
他们都恨你入骨  曼鞑
They all hate you, Mando.

107
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,760
因为你是个传奇
Because you're a legend!

108
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,130
他们有多少人得到了跟踪器
How many of them had tracking fobs?

109
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,640
所有人  所有人  但没人能像你一般完成交易
All of them. All of them! But not one of them closed the deal.

110
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,020
只有你  曼鞑  只有你
Only you, Mando. Only you.

111
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,060
随之而来的
And with it,

112
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,860
便是这个秒差距有史以来最丰厚的赏金
the richest reward this parsec has ever seen.

113
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,460
请坐  我的朋友
Please sit, my friend.

114
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,890
他们都在估量你身上贝斯卡钢的重量  但我不然
They're all weighing the Beskar in their minds, but not me.

115
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,870
不  就我来说  我会庆贺你的成功
No. I, for one, I celebrate your success.

116
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,410
因为这同样也是我的成功
Because it is my success as well.

117
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,790
该死  就连我也狠赚一笔
Hell! Even I am rich.

118
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,240
现在  我该如何向最宝贵的搭档聊表谢意呢
Now, how can I show my gratitude to my most valuable partner?

119
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,800
我想要下一份工作
I want my next job.

120
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,720
下一份工作
Next job?

121
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,890
你该放个假  尽情享乐
Take some time off. Enjoy yourself.

122
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,940
我请你去泡提列克养生浴吧
I'll take you to the Twi'lek healing baths.

123
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,400
我想要下一份工作
I want my next job.

124
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,610
行  好吧
Sure. Fine.

125
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,700
你们赏金猎人就是闲不下来  不是吗
You hunters like to keep busy, right?

126
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,530
这些活儿都要跑很远
Well, these are all far away.

127
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,580
越远  越好
The further, the better.

128
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,000
自己挑吧  你应得的
Well, take your pick. You've earned it.

129
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,470
挑了个最棒的活儿  从保释中逃跑的贵族儿子
That's the best one of the lot. A nobleman's son skipped bail.

130
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,630
（注：被通缉的是一个蒙卡拉马里人）

131
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,680
看来你要去一趟卡纳克海洋沙丘
Looks like you're headed to the ocean dunes of Karnac.

132
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,900
你知道他们会怎样对它吗
Any idea what they're gonna do with it?

133
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,210
对什么
With what?

134
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,320
那孩子
The kid.

135
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,910
我没问  这违反行会准则
I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code.

136
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,350
他们替帝国办事  他们在这里干什么
They work for the Empire. What are they doing here?

137
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,930
帝国不存在了  曼鞑
The Empire is gone, Mando.

138
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,250
只剩下一群雇佣兵和军阀
All that are left are mercenaries and warlords.

139
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,580
但要是你觉得不妥
But if it bothers you,

140
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,960
尽管回核心世界  向新共和国举报
just go back to the Core and report them to the New Republic.

141
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,630
笑话
That's a joke.

142
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,180
曼鞑  好好花你的赏金
Mando, enjoy your rewards.

143
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,930
买一罐桶香料
Buy a camtono of spice.

144
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,190
到你从超空间出来时  就再也不会想这个了
By the time you come out of hyperdrive, you will have forgotten all about it.

145
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,040
我不管
I don't care.

146
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,880
我命令你取出所需材料  把这事情办妥
I order you to extract the necessary material and be done with it.

147
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,720
他明确指示我们  要把它活着带回
He has explicitly ordered us to bring it back alive.

148
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,060
赶紧完成任务  现在我已经不能保证你安全
Finish your business quickly, as I no longer can guarantee your safety.

149
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,870
检查外围
Check the perimeter.

150
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,420
（注：这是一个帝国审讯机器人）

151
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,880
不  不  不  不  求你
No, no, no, no, please.

152
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,920
求你  不要  不要  不
Please. No. No, no.

153
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,650
不要  求你
No, please.

154
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,680
求你别伤害他   那只是个孩子
Please don't hurt him. It's just a child.

155
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,890
求你  不要  不  求你  不要  不要  不
Please. No. No! Please. No. No, no.

156
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,690
你对它干什么了  你对它干什么了
What did you do to it? What did you do it?

157
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,110
我保护着他  我保护着他
I protected him. I protected him.

158
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,240
要不是我  他已经死了
If it wasn't for me, he would already be dead!

159
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,870
求你  求你  求你
Please! Please. Please.

160
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,350
看  那边
Look, there!

161
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,610
分开找  把他赶出来
Split up. We'll flush him out.

162
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,320
收到
Copy.

163
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,910
投降吧  你已经无
Give it up. There's nowhere to...

164
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,550
快
Hurry!

165
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,170
站住
Freeze!

166
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,880
不许动
Don't move.

167
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,340
举起手来
Hands up.

168
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,840
把枪放下
Drop the blaster.

169
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,760
等等  我手里的东西可价值连城
Wait. What I'm holding is very valuable.

170
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,450
放下了
Here.

171
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,900
转过来面朝着我
Now turn and face me.

172
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,950
站起来
Stand up!

173
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,180
欢迎回来  曼鞑
Welcome back, Mando!

174
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,720
把东西放下
Now put the package down.

175
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,060
都闪开  我要回我的飞船
Step aside. I'm going to my ship.

176
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,610
你把悬赏物放下  或许我会放你过去
You put the bounty down and perhaps I'll let you pass.

177
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,570
这孩子必须和我在一起
The kid's coming with me.

178
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,720
如果你是真的关心这孩子  那就把它放在陆行艇里
If you truly care about the kid, then you'll put it on the speeder

179
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,780
然后我们再来谈条件
and we'll discuss terms.

180
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,210
我怎么知道能相信你
How do I know I can trust you?

181
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,500
因为我是你唯一的希望
Because I'm your only hope.

182
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,660
快开
Drive.

183
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,690
快开
Drive!

184
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,400
真是把好兵器
That's one impressive weapon!

185
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,740
接下来我要这么干
Here's what I'm gonna do.

186
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,160
我会带着这孩子走回飞船上  你们就干看着
I'm gonna walk to my ship with the kid and you're gonna let it happen.

187
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,370
不行  这样怎么样
No. How about this?

188
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,040
我们带走孩子
We take the kid,

189
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,670
如果你试图阻挠  我们就杀了你再把你分尸
and if you try to stop us, we kill you and we strip your body for parts.

190
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,310
别打中目标
Don't hit the target!

191
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,350
快走  我们来挡住他们
Get out of here! We'll hold them off!

192
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,960
你们必须要转移隐蔽所了
You're going to have to relocate the covert.

193
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,860
正是此道
This is the Way.

194
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,230
正是此道
This is the Way.

195
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,920
不要动  曼鞑
Hold it, Mando.

196
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,790
我本不想走到这一步
I didn't want it to come to this.

197
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,970
但你破坏了准则
But then you broke the Code.

198
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,880
我得弄一套这东西
I gotta get one of those.
