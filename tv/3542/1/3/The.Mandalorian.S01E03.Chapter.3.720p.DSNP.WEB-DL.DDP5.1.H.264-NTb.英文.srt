1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,650
There is one job.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,560
Underworld?

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,020
Face to face.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,110
Bounty hunting is a complicated profession.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,240
Proof of termination

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,000
is also acceptable for a lower fee.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,000
My ship has been destroyed. I'm trapped here.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,160
These are my parts. They stole them from me.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
You can trade.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,020
The egg? What egg?

14
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,440
Mando. I've received your transmission. Wonderful news.

15
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,200
Upon your return, deliver the quarry directly to the client.

16
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,340
I have no idea if he wants to eat it or hang it on his wall,

17
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,530
but he's very antsy.

18
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,120
Safe passage! You know where to find me.

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,630
It's not a toy.

20
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,460
Easy with that.

21
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,540
You take it easy.

22
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,760
Yes!

23
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,630
Yes, yes, yes!

24
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,310
Yes.

25
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,570
Very healthy. Yes. 

26
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,740
Your reputation was not unwarranted.

27
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,410
How many fobs did you give out?

28
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,170
This asset was of extreme importance to me.

29
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,340
I had to ensure its delivery.

30
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,510
But to the winner...

31
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,430
Go the spoils.

32
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,370
Such a large bounty for such a small package.

33
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,060
What are your plans for it?

34
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,190
How uncharacteristic of one of your reputation.

35
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,280
You have taken both commission and payment.

36
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,650
Is it not the Code of the Guild

37
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,820
that these events are now forgotten?

38
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,970
That Beskar is enough to make

39
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,460
a handsome replacement for your armor.

40
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,750
Unfortunately, finding a Mandalorian in these trying times

41
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,220
is more difficult than finding the steel.

44
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,320
This amount can be shaped many ways.

45
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,920
My armor has lost its integrity.

46
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,290
I may need to begin again.

47
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,540
Indeed. I can form a full cuirass.

48
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,830
This would be in order for your station.

49
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,170
That would be a great honor.

50
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,550
I must warn you. It will draw many eyes.

51
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,270
These were cast in an Imperial smelter.

52
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,270
These are the spoils of the Great Purge.

53
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,980
The reason that we live hidden like sand rats.

54
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,570
Our secrecy is our survival.

55
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,950
Our survival is our strength.

56
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,160
Our strength was once in our numbers.

57
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,090
Now we live in the shadows

58
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,410
and only come above ground one at a time.

59
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,720
Our world was shattered by the Empire,

60
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,210
with whom this coward shares tables.

61
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,690
The Empire is no longer.

62
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,570
And the Beskar has returned.

63
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,360
When one chooses to walk the Way of the Mandalore,

64
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,240
you are both hunter and prey.

65
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,300
How can one be a coward if one chooses this way of life?

66
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,830
Have you ever removed your helmet?

67
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,210
No.

68
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,790
Has it ever been removed by others?

69
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,750
Never.

70
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,760
This is the Way.

71
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,590
This is the Way.

72
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,510
This is the Way.

73
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,810
What caused this damage?

74
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,640
A mudhorn.

75
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,650
Then you have earned the Mudhorn as your signet.

76
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,820
I shall craft it.

77
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,110
I can't accept. It wasn't a noble kill.

78
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,780
I was helped by an enemy.

79
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,830
Why would an enemy help you in battle?

80
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,160
It did not know it was my enemy.

81
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,510
Since you forgo a signet,

82
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,840
I shall use the excess to forge whistling birds.

83
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,890
Whistling birds will do well.

84
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,470
Reserve some for the foundlings.

85
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,770
As it should always be. The foundlings are the future.

86
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,310
This is the Way.

87
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,190
This is the Way.

88
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,020
This is the Way.

89
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,550
Whistling birds are a powerful defense against multiple enemies.

90
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,720
Use them sparingly, for they are rare.

91
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,780
Look, I told you.

92
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,400
I'm not interested in your excuses!

93
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,190
You had your shot, dust breather, but you failed.

94
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,780
No pucks for you. Now get outta here.

95
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,600
Mando!

96
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,020
They all hate you, Mando. Because you're a legend!

97
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,360
How many of them had tracking fobs?

98
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,920
All of them. All of them! But not one of them closed the deal.

99
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,490
Only you, Mando. Only you.

100
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,330
And with it,

101
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,250
the richest reward this parsec has ever seen.

102
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,620
Please sit, my friend.

103
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,060
They're all weighing the Beskar in their minds, but not me.

104
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,180
No. I, for one, I celebrate your success.

105
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,640
Because it is my success as well.

106
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,810
Hell! Even I am rich.

107
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,560
Now, how can I show my gratitude to my most valuable partner?

108
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,020
I want my next job.

109
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,990
Next job?

110
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,070
Take some time off. Enjoy yourself.

111
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,160
I'll take you to the Twi'lek healing baths.

112
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,750
I want my next job.

113
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,790
Sure. Fine.

114
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,810
You hunters like to keep busy, right?

115
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,840
Well, these are all far away.

116
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,720
The further, the better.

117
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,220
Well, take your pick. You've earned it.

118
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,570
Ah. That's the best one of the lot.

119
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,770
A nobleman's son skipped bail.

120
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,030
Looks like you're headed to the ocean dunes of Karnac.

121
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,240
Any idea what they're gonna do with it?

122
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,450
With what?

123
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,540
The kid.

124
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,250
I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code.

125
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,840
They work for the Empire.

126
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,550
What are they doing here?

127
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,260
The Empire is gone, Mando.

128
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,360
All that are left are mercenaries and warlords.

129
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,720
But if it bothers you,

130
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,230
just go back to the Core and report them to the New Republic.

131
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,810
That's a joke.

132
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,360
Mando, enjoy your rewards.

133
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,110
Buy a camtono of spice.

134
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,370
By the time you come out of hyperdrive,

135
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,410
you will have forgotten all about it.

136
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,150
I don't care.

137
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,600
I order you to extract the necessary material

138
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,190
and be done with it.

139
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,790
He has explicitly ordered us

140
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,990
to bring it back alive.

141
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,070
Finish your business quickly,

142
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,370
as I no longer can guarantee your safety.

143
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,130
Check the perimeter.

144
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,350
No, no, no, no, please. Please. No. No, no.

145
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,860
No, please.

146
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,940
Please don't hurt him. It's just a child.

147
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,280
Please. No. No! Please. No. No, no.

148
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,930
What did you do to it? What did you do it?

149
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,180
I protected him. I protected him.

150
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,930
If it wasn't for me, he would already be dead!

151
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,880
Please! Please. Please.

152
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,540
Look, there!

153
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,750
Split up. We'll flush him out.

154
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,180
Give it up. There's nowhere to...

155
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,690
Hey!

156
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,480
Freeze!

157
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,980
Don't move.

158
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,610
Hands up.

159
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,020
Drop the blaster.

160
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,030
Wait. What I'm holding is very valuable.

161
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:51,900
Here.

162
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,210
Now turn and face me.

163
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,300
Stand up!

164
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,360
Welcome back, Mando!

165
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,030
Now put the package down.

166
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,410
Step aside. I'm going to my ship.

167
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,960
You put the bounty down and perhaps I'll let you pass.

168
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,840
The kid's coming with me.

169
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,020
If you truly care about the kid,

170
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,880
then you'll put it on the speeder

171
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,090
and we'll discuss terms.

172
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,430
How do I know I can trust you?

173
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,850
Because I'm your only hope.

174
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,850
Drive. 

175
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,010
Drive!

176
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,750
That's one impressive weapon!

177
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,000
Here's what I'll do.

178
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,760
I'm gonna walk to my ship with the kid

179
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,340
and you're gonna let it happen.

180
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,760
No. How about this?

181
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,260
We take the kid,

182
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,600
and if you try to stop us, we kill you

183
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,980
and we strip your body for parts.

184
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,650
Don't hit the target!

185
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,660
Get out of here! We'll hold them off!

186
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,330
You're going to have to relocate the covert.

187
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,000
This is the way.

188
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,410
This is the way.

189
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,110
Hold it, Mando.

190
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,030
I didn't want it to come to this.

191
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,240
But then you broke the Code.

192
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,190
I gotta get one of those.
