曼达人  我收到你的讯息了  好消息啊
Mando. I've received your transmission. Wonderful news.

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,200
你返程时  直接把猎物送交给客人吧
Upon your return, deliver the quarry directly to the client.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,340
我不知道他是想要吃了它还是把它挂墙上
I have no idea if he wants to eat it or hang it on his wall,

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,530
反正他抓耳挠腮地等呢
but he's very antsy.

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,120
一路平安  你知道去哪找我
Safe passage! You know where to find me.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,630
这不是玩具
It's not a toy.

23
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,460
你当心点
Easy with that.

24
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,540
你才当心点
You take it easy.

25
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,760
对
Yes!

26
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,630
对  对  对
Yes, yes, yes!

27
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,310
对
Yes.

28
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,570
非常健康  对
Very healthy. Yes.

29
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,740
你果然名不虚传
Your reputation was not unwarranted.

30
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,410
你给出去多少个追踪器
How many fobs did you give out?

31
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,170
它对我至关重要
This asset was of extreme importance to me.

32
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,340
我得要保证我能拿到它
I had to ensure its delivery.

33
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,510
但谁是胜利者...
But to the winner...

34
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,430
奖励就归谁
Go the spoils.

35
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,370
小小的猎物  如此巨额的赏金
Such a large bounty for such a small package.

36
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,060
你准备拿它做什么
What are your plans for it?

37
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,190
你这样成名的人问这个不太符合身份啊
How uncharacteristic of one of your reputation.

38
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,280
你已经拿了佣金和赏金
You have taken both commission and payment.

39
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,650
《公会章程》不是规定
Is it not the Code of the Guild

40
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,820
这些事就已经当不存在了吗
that these events are now forgotten?

41
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,970
那曼达洛铁足够
That Beskar is enough to make

42
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,460
给你换副不错的铠甲了
a handsome replacement for your armor.

43
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,750
不幸的是  在当前的艰难岁月找到个曼达洛人
Unfortunately, finding a Mandalorian in these trying times

44
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,220
要比找到曼达洛铁难得多
is more difficult than finding the steel.

曼达洛人

第三章
罪恶

47
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,320
这个数量可以锻造成很多形状
This amount can be shaped many ways.

48
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,920
我的铠甲不太结实了
My armor has lost its integrity.

49
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,290
我可能又要重新做了
I may need to begin again.

50
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,540
确实  我可以锻造出完整的胸甲
Indeed. I can form a full cuirass.

51
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,830
这会与你的身份相符
This would be in order for your station.

52
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,170
我荣幸之至
That would be a great honor.

53
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,550
我必须警告你  它会非常惹眼的
I must warn you. It will draw many eyes.

54
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,270
这些是在帝国的熔炉里炼出来的
These were cast in an Imperial smelter.

55
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,270
是绝地大屠杀中掠夺来的
These are the spoils of the Great Purge.

56
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,980
而大屠杀正是我们像沙鼠一样隐居的根源
The reason that we live hidden like sand rats.

57
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,570
我们的隐秘让我们得以生存
Our secrecy is our survival.

58
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,950
我们的生存让我们拥有力量
Our survival is our strength.

59
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,160
从前我们的力量来自于我们的数量
Our strength was once in our numbers.

60
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,090
现在我们不见天日地苟且
Now we live in the shadows

61
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,410
只能一个一个地单独到地面上去
and only come above ground one at a time.

62
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,720
我们的世界被帝国给粉碎了
Our world was shattered by the Empire,

63
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,210
而这个懦夫还与之同流合污
with whom this coward shares tables.

64
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,690
帝国已经不存在了
The Empire is no longer.

65
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,570
而曼达洛铁又回来了
And the Beskar has returned.

66
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,360
当你选择了以曼达洛之道行事
When one chooses to walk the Way of the Mandalore,

67
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,240
你既是猎人也是猎物
you are both hunter and prey.

68
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,300
选择这样的生存之道的人怎么可能是懦夫呢
How can one be a coward if one chooses this way of life?

69
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,830
你取下过头盔吗
Have you ever removed your helmet?

70
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,210
没有
No.

71
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,790
被别人取下来过吗
Has it ever been removed by others?

72
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,750
从来没有
Never.

73
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,760
此乃正道
This is the Way.

74
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,590
此乃正道
This is the Way.

75
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,510
此乃正道
This is the Way.

76
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,810
怎么受的伤
What caused this damage?

77
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,640
泥角兽
A mudhorn.

78
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,650
泥角兽已经成为了你的印记
Then you have earned the Mudhorn as your signet.

79
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,820
我会制作完成
I shall craft it.

80
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,110
我无法接受  那不是正大光明的击杀
I can't accept. It wasn't a noble kill.

81
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,780
敌人帮了我的忙
I was helped by an enemy.

82
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,830
为什么敌人会帮助你战斗
Why would an enemy help you in battle?

83
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
它不知道自己是我的敌人
It did not know it was my enemy.

84
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,510
既然你放弃印记
Since you forgo a signet,

85
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,840
我会用多余的资源铸造鸟哨
I shall use the excess to forge whistling birds.

86
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,890
鸟哨很不错
Whistling birds will do well.

87
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,470
为那些弃婴留一些
Reserve some for the foundlings.

88
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,770
本来就应该这样  弃婴才是未来
As it should always be. The foundlings are the future.

89
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,310
此乃正道
This is the Way.

90
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,190
此乃正道
This is the Way.

91
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,020
此乃正道
This is the Way.

92
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,550
鸟哨是一种能够抵挡多种敌人的强力防御装置
Whistling birds are a powerful defense against multiple enemies.

93
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,720
省着点用  因为它们很稀少
Use them sparingly, for they are rare.

94
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,780
我和你说过
Look, I told you.

95
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,400
我对你的借口没兴趣
I'm not interested in your excuses!

96
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,190
你已经试过了  吸尘怪  但你失败了
You had your shot, dust breather, but you failed.

97
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,780
你没有赏金碟了  赶紧出去
No pucks for you. Now get outta here.

98
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,600
曼达人
Mando!

99
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,020
他们都恨你  曼达人  因为你是传奇
They all hate you, Mando. Because you're a legend!

100
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,360
他们之中有多少人有追踪器
How many of them had tracking fobs?

101
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,920
他们都有  但他们没一个人完成了任务
All of them. All of them! But not one of them closed the deal.

102
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,490
只有你  曼达人  只有你
Only you, Mando. Only you.

103
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,330
有了它
And with it,

104
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,250
这个光年内最丰厚的奖赏
the richest reward this parsec has ever seen.

105
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,620
请坐  我的朋友
Please sit, my friend.

106
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,060
他们脑子里想的都是曼达洛铁  但我不是
They're all weighing the Beskar in their minds, but not me.

107
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,180
不  我庆祝你的成功
No. I, for one, I celebrate your success.

108
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,640
因为这也是我的成功
Because it is my success as well.

109
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,810
即使我很富有
Hell! Even I am rich.

110
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,560
如何才能向我最重要的合作伙伴表达感激呢
Now, how can I show my gratitude to my most valuable partner?

111
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,020
我要下一个任务
I want my next job.

112
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,990
下一个任务
Next job?

113
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,070
休息一会  好好享受一下
Take some time off. Enjoy yourself.

114
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,160
我带你去泡提列克疗伤浴
I'll take you to the Twi'lek healing baths.

115
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,750
我要下一个任务
I want my next job.

116
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,790
好吧
Sure. Fine.

117
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,810
你们这些赏金猎人就喜欢忙个不停  对吗
You hunters like to keep busy, right?

118
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,840
这些都在很远的地方
Well, these are all far away.

119
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,720
越远越好
The further, the better.

120
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,220
你选吧  这是你应得的
Well, take your pick. You've earned it.

121
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,570
这是最好的任务
Ah. That's the best one of the lot.

122
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,770
一个贵族的儿子在假释之后逃跑了
A nobleman's son skipped bail.

123
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,030
看来你得前往卡纳克的海丘
Looks like you're headed to the ocean dunes of Karnac.

124
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,240
你知道他们会怎么做吗
Any idea what they're gonna do with it?

125
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,450
什么怎么做
With what?

126
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,540
对那个孩子
The kid.

127
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,250
我没问  这违反公会规定
I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code.

128
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,840
他们为帝国工作
They work for the Empire.

129
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,550
他们在那里干什么
What are they doing here?

130
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,260
已经没有帝国了  曼达人
The Empire is gone, Mando.

131
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,360
只留下了佣兵和军阀
All that are left are mercenaries and warlords.

132
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
如果你介意
But if it bothers you,

133
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,230
返回核心区域  把他们汇报给新共和国
just go back to the Core and report them to the New Republic.

134
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,810
真是笑话
That's a joke.

135
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,360
曼达人  去享受你的奖赏吧
Mando, enjoy your rewards.

136
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,110
去买一瓶香料吧
Buy a camtono of spice.

137
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,370
你从脱离曲速之后
By the time you come out of hyperdrive,

138
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,410
你肯定就已经全忘了
you will have forgotten all about it.

139
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,150
我不在乎
I don't care.

140
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,600
我命令你取出必要的材料
I order you to extract the necessary material

141
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,190
然后就行了
and be done with it.

142
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,790
他很明确地命令我们
He has explicitly ordered us

143
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,990
要抓活的回来
to bring it back alive.

144
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,070
快点搞定你的任务
Finish your business quickly,

145
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,370
因为我不能再保证你的安全了
as I no longer can guarantee your safety.

146
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,130
检查周围
Check the perimeter.

147
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,350
不不不  求你了  不不不
No, no, no, no, please. Please. No. No, no.

148
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,860
不  求你
No, please.

149
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,940
别伤害它  它只是个孩子
Please don't hurt him. It's just a child.

150
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,280
求你了  不要
Please. No. No! Please. No. No, no.

151
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,930
你把它怎么了  你把它怎么了
What did you do to it? What did you do it?

152
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,180
我保护了它  我保护了它
I protected him. I protected him.

153
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,930
没有我在的话  它现在已经死了
If it wasn't for me, he would already be dead!

154
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,880
求你  求你
Please! Please. Please.

155
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,540
看  那里
Look, there!

156
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,750
分头行动  我们逼他出来
Split up. We'll flush him out.

157
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,180
放弃吧  没有地方可...
Give it up. There's nowhere to...

158
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,690
站住
Hey!

159
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,480
不许动
Freeze!

160
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,980
不许动
Don't move.

161
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,610
举起手来
Hands up.

162
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,020
把枪放下
Drop the blaster.

163
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,030
等等  我手里的东西很有价值
Wait. What I'm holding is very valuable.

164
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,900
在这里
Here.

165
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,210
转过来对着我
Now turn and face me.

166
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,300
站起来
Stand up!

167
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,360
欢迎回来  曼达人
Welcome back, Mando!

168
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,030
把猎物放下吧
Now put the package down.

169
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,410
让开  我要去我的飞船
Step aside. I'm going to my ship.

170
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,960
你把猎物放下  我可能会让你过去
You put the bounty down and perhaps I'll let you pass.

171
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,840
这孩子跟我走
The kid's coming with me.

172
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,020
如果你真的在意这孩子
If you truly care about the kid,

173
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,880
就把它放在陆行艇上
then you'll put it on the speeder

174
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,090
我们再谈条件
and we'll discuss terms.

175
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,430
我怎么知道能不能相信你
How do I know I can trust you?

176
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,850
因为我是你唯一的希望了
Because I'm your only hope.

177
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,850
开车
Drive.

178
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,010
快开车
Drive!

179
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,750
武器真棒啊
That's one impressive weapon!

180
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,000
接下来我会这么做
Here's what I'll do.

181
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,760
我要带这孩子去飞船上
I'm gonna walk to my ship with the kid

182
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,340
你必须让我过去
and you're gonna let it happen.

183
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,760
不行  这样怎么样
No. How about this?

184
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,260
我们把孩子带走
We take the kid,

185
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,600
如果你想阻止我们  我们就杀了你
and if you try to stop us, we kill you

186
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,980
然后把你身上能用的部件都搜刮走
and we strip your body for parts.

187
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,650
别打中目标
Don't hit the target!

188
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,660
快跑  我们掩护
Get out of here! We'll hold them off!

189
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,330
你得把神秘人物转移了
You're going to have to relocate the covert.

190
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,000
此乃正道
This is the way.

191
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,410
此乃正道
This is the way.

192
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,110
站住  曼达人
Hold it, Mando.

193
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,030
我不想让事情发展成这样
I didn't want it to come to this.

194
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,240
可你违背了条约
But then you broke the Code.

195
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,190
我也得来个那种装备
I gotta get one of those.
