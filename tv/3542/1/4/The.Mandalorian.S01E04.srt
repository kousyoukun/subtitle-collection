小小的猎物
Such a large bounty

3
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:09,562
如此巨额的赏金
for such a small package.

我的盔甲不太结实了
My armor has lost its integrity.

我可能又要重新做了
I may need to begin again.

他们都恨你  曼达人

他们会怎么做
What are they doing with it?

00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:29,002
我没问  这违反公会规定
I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code.

让开  我要去我的飞船
Step aside. I'm going to my ship.

你把猎物放下  我可能会让你过去
You put the bounty down and perhaps I'll let you pass.

00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:51,652
他们之中有多少人有追踪器
How many of them had tracking fobs?

他们希望可以低调迅速
They wanted it fast and quiet.

00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,172
他们用运输舰派遣我们
They'd send us in on the drop ships.

没有支援  只靠我们自己

I figured you had a fob on me. That's why I came at you so hard.

所以你们觉得我是雇佣兵吗
So, you think I'm some kinda mercenary?

或者至少穿着曼达洛盔甲
Or at least wearing Mandalorian armor.

你们住哪里
Where do you live?

105
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:24,592
农场啊  你没听我说吗
On a farm. Weren't you listening?

106
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:26,012
我们是农民
We're farmers.

107

Yes.

109
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,102
你们有农舍吗
You have lodging?

110
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,142
当然有
Yeah. Absolutely.

111
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:36,982
很好  上来帮忙
Good. Come up and help.

112
00:12:47,962 --> 00:12:49,202
我还需要一样东西
I'm gonna need one more thing.

113
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:51,412
给我那些钱
Give me those credits.

114
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,332
准备好再战一场了吗
Ready for round two?

115
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:04,892
所以我们基本就是要赶走掠夺者
So, we're basically running off

116
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:06,762
为了换饭钱而吧
a band of Raiders for lunch money?

117
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:08,842
他们让我们在偏远的地方落脚
They're quartering us in the middle of nowhere.

118
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:10,902
据我所知  对于你这种处境的人
Last I checked, that's a pretty square deal

119
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,392
这样的现状已经很合理了
for somebody in your position.

120
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:14,652
最坏的情况就是开枪
Worst case scenario, you tune up your blaster.

121
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:17,022
最好的情况就是我们威慑住他们
Best case, we're a deterrent.

122
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,622
我觉得这些树林里不会有
I can't imagine there's anything living in these trees

123

前震击士兵搞不定的生物
that an ex-shock trooper couldn't handle.

124
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:45,552

Everyone, they're here!

125
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:48,672
快来
Come on.

126
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:54,352
看起来他们很高兴见到我们
Well, looks like they're happy to see us.

127
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:55,812
看起来是
Looks like.

- Hi. - He's so cute.

请进
Please come in.

130
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,802
希望这里够舒服
I hope this is comfortable for you.

131
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,052
不好意思  我们只有谷仓
Sorry that all we have is the barn.

132
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:34,592
这就可以
This will do fine.

133
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,722
我在这里放了些被褥
I stacked some blankets over here.

134
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,272
谢谢  你真好心
Thank you. That's very kind.

135
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:55,532
这是我女儿  文塔
This is my daughter, Winta.

136
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:58,832
我们这里很少有人来
We don't get a lot of visitors around here.

137
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:01,962
她不习惯见到陌生人
She's not used to strangers.

138
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:07,292
这个好心人会保护我们不受坏人侵扰
This nice man is going to help protect us from the bad ones.

139
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:09,552
谢谢你
Thank you.

140
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:16,892
走吧  文塔  给我们的客人一些空间
Come on, Winta. Let's give our guests some room.

141
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,402
-在吗  -请进
- Knock, knock. - Come in.

142
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:52,962
我可以喂他吗
Can I feed him?

143
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:56,052
没问题
Sure.

144
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:03,892
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

145
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,522
我能跟他玩吗
Can I play with him?

146
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,402
没问题
Sure.

147
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:24,292
来吧
Come on.

148
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:27,792
-我不觉得...  -他们没事的
- I don't think... - They'll be fine.

149
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:29,542
-我不...  -他们没事的
- I don't... - They'll be fine.

150
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,762
我拿了些食物过来
I brought you some food.

151
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,052
我看你在那里没有吃东西
I noticed you didn't eat out there.

152
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,392
我放在这里就走了
I'll leave it here for when I go.

153
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:40,642
你真细心
That's very thoughtful of you.

154
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,312
介意我问个问题吗
Do you mind if ask you something?

155
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:48,652
说吧
Go ahead.

156
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:53,732
你有多久没卸下盔甲了
How long has it been since you've taken that off?

157
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:56,192
自从昨天
Yesterday.

158
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:00,912
我是说  在别人面前
I mean, in front of someone else.

159
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:10,382
上次的时候我和他们差不多大
I wasn't much older than they are.

160
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:17,972
你自从小时候就没在别人面前露过脸了吗
You haven't shown your face to anyone since you were a kid?

161
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:23,352
没有过  他们收留我我很开心
No. I was happy that they took me in.

162
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:27,772
我父母被杀了  曼达洛人收留了我
My parents were killed and the Mandalorians took care of me.

163
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:30,192
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

164
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:32,272
此乃正道
This is the way.

165
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:38,572
有任何需要就告诉我们
Let us know if there's anything you need.

166
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:40,822
谢谢
Thank you.

167
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:22,712
大约有十五到二十人
About 15 or 20 of them

168
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,072
是徒步过来的
came through here on foot.

169
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:32,372
有个庞然大物把这些树枝撕碎了
And something big sheared off those branches.

170
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,142
AT-ST
AT-ST.

171
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,142
{\an8}帝国的一种装甲兵器  全地形侦察步行机

172
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,772
帝国的步行机怎么会在这
Imperial walker. What's it doing here?

173
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:52,392
我不知道
I don't know.

174
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:57,272
但这已经超出我的能力范围了
But this is more than I signed up for.

175
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:04,782
坏消息  你们不能住在这了
Bad news. You can't live here anymore.

176
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,662
什么  为什么
What? Why?

177
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:08,582
你可真客气
Nice bedside manner.

178
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,082
你有更好的说法吗
You think you can do better?

179
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:12,332
想不出更坏的说法了
Can't do much worse.

180
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:16,392
我知道你们不希望听到这个消息
I know this is not the news you wanted to hear,

181
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,022
但你们别无选择
but there are no other options.

182
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,682
-你接下了这份活  -没错
- You took the job. - Yeah.

183
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:22,132
那是在我们知道AT-ST之前
That was before we knew about the AT-ST.

184
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:23,342
那是什么
What is that?

185
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:25,692
配备两门炮的武装步行机
The armored walker with two enormous guns

186
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:27,472
你们明明知道  但是没告诉我们
that you knew about and didn't tell us.

187
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:28,782
-帮帮我们  -求你了
- Help us. - Please.

188
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:30,722
-你应该是来帮我们的  -但我们雇了你
- You're supposed to help us. - But we hired you.

189
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:33,312
-求你了  -我们无处可去
- Please. - We have nowhere to go.

190
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,902
当然有  这个星球很大
Sure you do. This is a big planet.

191
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:37,582
我还见过比这小得多的星球
I mean, I've seen a lot smaller.

192
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:39,732
我的祖辈给这些池塘播种
My grandparents seeded these ponds.

193
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,032
-好几代人的心血  -没错
- It took generations. - Yeah.

194
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:45,912
我理解  但我们只有两个人
I understand. I do. But there are only two of us.

195
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:48,462
不  那里至少还有二十个人
No, there's not. There's at least 20 here.

196
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:51,672
我是指战士  现实点吧
I mean fighters. Be realistic.

197
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:53,012
-我们可以学  -我们可以
- We can learn. - We can.

198
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,412
-给我们一次机会  -拜托了
- Give us a chance. - Please.

199
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:57,812
我曾经见过  那个东西在几分钟之内
I've seen that thing take out entire companies of soldiers

200
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,342
灭了一个连的士兵
in a matter of minutes.

201
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:04,302
我们不会走
We're not leaving.

202
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,052
你们无法对抗它
You cannot fight that thing.

203
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,182
除非我们教他们怎么做
Unless we show them how.

204
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:13,932
让我们看看
Show us.

205
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:15,352
我们办得到
Yeah, we can do this.

206
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,112
你们有两个麻烦
You got two problems here.

207
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,112
强盗和机械
You got the bandits, and you got the mech.

208
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:22,962
我们会解决步行机
We'll handle the AT-ST,

209
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:25,282
当他们突然冲出来时  你们得掩护我们
but you gotta protect us when they come out of the woods.

210
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,572
我也不必再说他们有多危险
And I don't have to tell you how dangerous they are.

211
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:29,742
卡拉·杜恩是一名老兵
Cara Dune here was a veteran.

212
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,042
她曾是反抗军的伞兵
She was a drop soldier for the Rebellion,

213
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:35,292
她会为你们制定计划  仔细听好
and she's gonna lay out a plan for you, so listen carefully.

214
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,302
在这个星球上
Now, there's nothing on this planet

215
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,882
没有什么可以破坏步行机的腿
that can damage the legs on this thing,

216
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:40,502
所以我们要挖个陷阱
so we're gonna build a trap.

217
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:43,552
我们要在这里挖个很深的洞
We're gonna need to dig real deep, right here,

218
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:46,632
如果它踩到  就会掉下去
so that when it steps in, it drops.

219
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:49,932
我们两个会突袭他们的营地  引出他们
The two of us will hit their camp. Provoke them.

220
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:52,682
这样就可以把战斗地点从森林转移到我们这
That'll bring the fight out of the woods and down here to us.

221
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,652
我需要你们把树砍了
I'm gonna need you to cut down trees

222
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:57,062
在这些边缘处搭建障碍
and build barricades along these edges.

223
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:00,562
要足够高  让他们无法越过
I need it high enough so that they can't get over,

224
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:03,442
还要足够坚固  让他们无法突破
and strong enough so that it can't break through.

225
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:08,572
好了  谁会射击
Okay. Who knows how to shoot?

226
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,882
准备  一  把腿伸出来
Ready, one. Move your leg out.

227
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:27,092
准备好

229
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:39,102
一
One.

230
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:42,232
-伸出去  一  -开火
- Get into it. One. - Fire.

231
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:54,082
一
One.

232
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:55,332
二
Two.

233
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:56,582
三
Three.

234
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:57,912
四
Four.

235
00:21:58,892 --> 00:21:59,662
还原
Reset.

236
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,252
再响一点
Louder.

237
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:02,502
一
One.

238
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:03,922
二
Two.

239
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:12,472
快要日落了
The sun is about to set,

240
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,852
我们很快就会出发
and we'll be leaving soon.

241
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:16,142
当我们回来时  速度会很快
When we return, we're coming in hot.

242
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:18,522
我们会准备好
We'll be ready.

243
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:31,902
快  我掩护你
Come on. I'll cover you.

244
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,162
希望计划起效了
I hope the plan worked.

245
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:58,632
跑  快跑
Go. Go!

246
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:27,712
没事的
It's okay.

247
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,212
来了
This is it.

248
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:39,882
一旦它走进池塘  就会陷下去
Once that thing steps into the pond, it's goin' down.

249
00:25:47,992 --> 00:25:49,232
准备好武器
Weapons ready.

250
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:08,872
再等它走几步
Just a few more steps.

251
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:19,922
它停了
It stopped.

252
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:30,482
趴下  趴下
Get down. Get down.

253
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,202
卡本  待在那儿
Caben. Stay there.

254
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:51,082
守住你的位置
Hold your positions.

255
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:02,262
开火
Open fire.

256
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:21,282
我们得让那玩意继续走
We gotta get that thing to step forward.

257
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:22,032
我在想办法
I'm thinking.

258
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:23,402
退后  退后
Stay back, stay back!

259
00:27:32,932 --> 00:27:33,542
新计划
New plan.

260
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:35,012
你有什么计划
What do you have in mind?

261
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:36,132
把脉冲步枪给我
Give me the pulse rifle.

262
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:39,422
我来掩护你
I'll cover you.

263
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:53,772
加油  你可以的
Come on, you got this.

264
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:56,692
来找老娘吧
Come to Mama.

265
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:13,292
现在不上就没机会了
This is it. It's now or never.

266
00:28:13,602 --> 00:28:14,212
上啊
Go.

267
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,462
卡本  斯托克  上啊
Caben, Stoke, get out there.

268
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,692
上钩吧  你这个废物
Take the bait, you hunk of junk.

269
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:46,882
这也是计划吗
Was that the plan?

270
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:50,472
差不多吧
Somethin' like that.

271
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,462
谢谢
Thank you.

272
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:31,232
需要我给你屋子添点东西吗
Can I set you something in the house?

273
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:33,262
谢谢  回头再说吧
Uh, thank you. Maybe later.

274
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:37,892
他在这里很开心
He's very happy here.

275
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:40,182
是的
He is.

276
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:44,062
适应得很好
Fits right in.

277
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,162
如果你把盔甲脱了会怎么样
So, what happens if you take that thing off?

278
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:55,572
盔甲会追杀你吗
They come after you and kill you?

279
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:01,372
不会  但我就穿不上了
No. You just can't ever put it back on again.

280
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:04,212
就这样
That's it?

281
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:08,272
所以你可以把头盔摘了
So you can slip off the helmet,

282
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,212
和那个漂亮的年轻寡妇安顿下来
and settle down with that beautiful young widow,

283
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:13,052
把你的孩子养大  坐在这里喝斯波奇茶
and raise your kid sitting here, sipping spotchka?

284
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:21,022
几周前我们在这里惹了不少麻烦
You know, we raised some hell here a few weeks back.

285
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:24,272
对于这样一个穷乡僻壤的小镇来说  动静太大了
It's too much action for a backwater town like this.

286
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:27,022
消息传得很快
Word travels fast.

287
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:30,322
我们可能得收拾一下离开这里了
We might wanna cycle the charts and move on.

288
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,902
我可不想告诉他这个消息
Would not wanna be the one who's gotta tell him.

289
00:31:38,512 --> 00:31:39,542
我要把他留在这里
I'm leaving him here.

290
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:46,672
和我一起走  那孩子就过不上好日子了
Traveling with me, that's no life for a kid.

291
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,092
我完成任务了  他很安全  可以过上更好的生活
I did my job, he's safe. Better chance at a life.

292
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,722
来啊  来啊
Come on. Come on.

293
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:57,472
他肯定会难过的
It's gonna break his little heart.

294
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:02,392
他会撑过去的  我们都一样
He'll get over it. We all do.

295
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:29,172
不好意思  能和你聊聊吗
Excuse me. Can I have a word?

296
00:32:30,102 --> 00:32:30,882
当然
Of course.

297
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,022
这里很好
It's very nice here.

298
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:45,522
嗯
Yes.

299
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:49,442
很明显  他在这里很开心
I think it's clear he's... He's happy here.

300
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:51,572
那你呢
What about you?

301
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:53,442
我
Me?

302
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:55,782
你在这里开心吗
Are you happy here?

303
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:00,162
我们希望你能留下来
We want you to stay.

304
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:03,332
社区很感激你
The community's grateful.

305
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:06,332
你可以把盔甲收起来  免得有麻烦
You can pack all this away in case there's ever trouble.

306
00:33:08,762 --> 00:33:11,212
你和你的孩子可以过上好日子
You and your boy could have a good life.

307
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:15,092
不知道他什么时候才会长大
He could be a child for a while.

308
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:17,592
这不是很好吗
Wouldn't that be nice?

309
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:23,682
是的
It would.

310
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:40,492
我不属于这里
I don't belong here.

311
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:42,702
但他属于这里
But he does.

312
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:46,042
我明白
I understand.

313
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:53,342
我会像照顾自己的孩子一样照顾他
I will look after him as one of my own.

314
00:34:09,572 --> 00:34:10,642
去找孩子们
Go get the kids.

315
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:29,412
他在追踪谁
Who's he tracking?

316
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:31,212
孩子
The kid.

317
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:34,172
他们知道孩子在这里
They know he's here.

318
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:35,882
嗯
Yes.

319
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:38,172
他们不会罢休的
Then they'll keep coming.

320
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:40,762
嗯
Yes.

321
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:58,572
你真的不需要护送吗
Are you sure you don't want an escort?

322
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,362
我很感谢你的提议
I appreciate the offer,

323
00:35:03,422 --> 00:35:04,792
但我们要绕过城镇
but we're gonna bypass the town

324
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,372
直接前往刀锋之巅
and head right to the Razor Crest.

325
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:11,252
好吧  那我们有缘再见
Well then, until our paths cross.

326
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:14,212
有缘再见
Until our paths cross.

327
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:24,342
我会很想你的
I'm gonna miss you so much.

328
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:33,482
谢谢
Thank you.
