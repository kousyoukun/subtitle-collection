1
00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:06,938
你是谁
So who are you?

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,232
我们收到你的警报了 在哪
we got your alert. Where's...

3
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,903
那不是凯特琳
That's not Caitlin.

4
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:17,823
怎 怎么回事
What's- - what's happening here?

5
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:21,369
事实上 这是一个很长很令人困惑的故事
Actually, it's kind of a long and very confusing story.

6
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:26,082
不过我们很乐意分享
One which we are happy to hafe.

7
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:29,335
首先 请认识一下 你可以叫我斯诺
First, please meet- - - You can call me Snow.

8
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:32,421
等等 意思是第三个斯诺姐妹吗
Wait, as in, like, the third Snow sister?

9
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,465
巴里 你还记得那次你发现
Barry, do you remember the time that you found out

10
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:36,342
凯特琳想要复活冰霜
Caitlin was trying to bring back Frost,

11
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:38,010
然后你毁了她的实验室吗
and you destroyed her lab?

12
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,221
我没得选
- I didn't have a choice.

13
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:41,305
重点是
The point is,

14
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,056
重点是
The point is,

15
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,016
凯特琳没有放弃
Caitlin never gave up.

16
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:46,018
她继续和我一起研究
She kept on working with me.

17
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,688
我们一起造了个机器 在凯特琳的身体里
Together, we built a machine to reactivate Frost's mind

18
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,064
重新激活了冰霜
in Caitlin's body.

19
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:52,108
-只有  -出了差错
Only Something went wrong.

20
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,694
代替凯特琳的是
But in place of Caitlin

21
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:56,362
是我
- I came out instead.

22
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:59,115
如果你不是凯特琳或冰霜
Well, if you're not Caitlin or Frost,

23
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,324
那你是谁
who are you?

24
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,035
说实话 我不知道
Honestly, I don't know.

25
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:08,040
我就像你们一样想知道我是谁
I wanna find out who I am just as much as the rest of you do.

26
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,711
这个斯诺完全是一张白纸
Snow here is a total blank slate

27
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:13,379
一点记忆没有
with zero memories.

28
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:16,173
所以我一直在尽力让她跟上进度
So I've been doing my best to bring her up to speed.

29
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:18,759
马克 凯特琳怎么了
Mark, what happened to Caitlin?

30
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,765
她在哪儿
Where is she?

31
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:26,100
凯特琳死了 巴里
Caitlin's dead, Barry.

32
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:27,560
-什么  -不可能
What? - That's impossible.

33
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:29,061
我知道你在想什么
- I- - I- - I know what you must be thinking,

34
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:32,815
但我有个让凯特琳复活的计划
but I have a plan to bring Caitlin back.

35
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:02,762
现在 冷冻舱应该从凯特琳身上提取了神经DNA
Now the CRC was supposed to unzip neural DNA from Caitlin.

36
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:04,847
这样我们就能把冰霜的脑信号
That way, we could isolate Frost's brain patterns

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,767
隔离在她体内 以后再下载到
inside of her- - - Download into another

38
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,101
另一个新的身体里
new body later on.

39
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:10,436
只是能量波动
Only a power fluctuation

40
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,812
导致了这个过程出了差错
caused the process to malfunction,

41
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,230
导致了这个过程出了差错
caused the process to malfunction,

42
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:15,066
所以如果
and so if

43
00:02:15,108 --> 00:02:19,153
闪电小队能给我提供稳定的能量来源
Team Flash could provide me with a stable energy source,

44
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,988
我们就能逆转这个过程
we could reverse the process

45
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,281
让凯特琳复活
and just bring Caitlin back.

46
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:23,115
让凯特琳复活
and just bring Caitlin back.

47
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:25,451
所以现在你要我们帮忙了
So now you want our help?

48
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,244
是为了凯特琳
For Caitlin's sake,

49
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:28,079
是为了凯特琳
For Caitlin's sake,

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,665
对
yeah.

51
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,085
毕竟是凯特琳  我们必须试试
It's Caitlin. We have to try.

52
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,295
嗯 我被说服了
Yeah, I'm sold.

53
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,797
反正我们也没什么损失
What do we have to lose?

54
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:41,717
好的
Okay.

55
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:45,638
开工吧
Let's get to work.

56
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,272
我表现得怎么样
How did Ido? -

57
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:55,189
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

58
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,815
你在开玩笑吗 
Are you kidding?

59
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:57,275
简直完美
You were perfect.

60
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,777
这比我们计划的要顺利
This is going better than we planned.

61
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,322
什么
What?

62
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,825
这就是凯特琳想要的
This is what Caitlin wanted.

63
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:09,245
当我们做宽这一切
And when we're done,

64
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:10,121
当我们做完这一切
And when we're done,

65
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,331
冰霜会回来的
Frost will be back.

66
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:12,873
冰霜会回来的
Frost will be back.

67
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:23,342
我不敢相信这真的发生了
- I can't believe this is really happening.

68
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:24,927
太疯狂了点
I mean, this is nuts.

69
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,012
确实
Yeah, I know, right?

70
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,849
尤其是
Especially with, uh,

71
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,891
尤其是
Especially with, uh,

72
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:33,227
就是最近发生的所有事
you know, everything else that's happened lately.

73
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:35,021
就是最近发生的所有事
you know, everything else that's happened lately.

74
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,364
爱兰歌娜 听着 最近发生的事
Allegra, look, about what happened,

75
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,074
-我只是想让你知道  -我觉得我们应该先
I just want you to know- - - I think we should focus

76
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:50,828
专注凯特琳的事
on Caitlin first...

77
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:53,539
然后 等一切都结束了
and then, you know, when this is all done- -

78
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,333
啊对 你说得对
Uh, yeah, yeah, totally.

79
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,542
-我理解  -嗯
I get it. Yeah.

80
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:57,168
对
Right.

81
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:57,668
对
Right.

82
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:12,141
这一天天的
What a day.

83
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:13,643
我还是不敢相信
I still can't believe it.

84
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:19,565
所以凯特琳消失了吗
So Caitlin's gone?

85
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,442
我知道
I know.

86
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:23,653
好难消化
It's too much- -

87
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:24,737
都好难消化
all of it.

88
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:28,950
宝贝 你没事吧
Babe, you okay?

89
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,205
巴里打电话来的时候 他说马克有办法
When Barry called, he said Mark has a plan

90
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:35,915
把凯特琳救回来
to get Caitlin back.

91
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,500
乔 这还不是我们唯一的麻烦
Joe, that is not even close to our only problem.

92
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,834
乔 这还不是我们唯一的麻烦
Joe, that is not even close to our only problem.

93
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:42,338
我想我们应该离开中城
- I think we should leave Central City.

94
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:48,386
塞西尔 我之所以
Cecile, the reason

95
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,095
说我们应该离开
I said we should leave

96
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,346
说我们应该离开
I said we should leave

97
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,598
是因为我担心
is because I'm worried that

98
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,892
你的新能力越强
the stronger your new abilities become,

99
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,185
你就越会被推上前线
the more it puts you on the front line.

100
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,061
你就越会被推上前线
the more it puts you on the front line.

101
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,396
-哎呀  -当然
Come on- - - God knows

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,772
你可以处理好任何事情
you can handle anything,

103
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,358
但我还是担心会有谁想来伤害
but I'm still worried about who or what

104
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,402
我爱的女人
is coming after the woman I love

105
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,404
和我孩子的母亲
and the mother of my child.

106
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:09,949
这个家不能
This family can't

107
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,953
不能承受失去你
It can't handle losing you.

108
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,767
宝贝 我理解的
Babe, I get it.

109
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,811
真的
I do.

110
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:42,273
但你问我的是 我该如何在我们的家庭
But what you're asking me, how am I supposed to...

111
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:45,026
和整个城市的利益之间
choose between our family

112
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,111
做出选择
and the greater good of the entire city?

113
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:48,321
我该怎么选
How am I supposed to do that?

114
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:51,324
我该怎么办
What am I supposed to do?

115
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,911
我们该怎么办
What are we supposed to do?

116
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,079
我不知道
- I don't know.

117
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,548
我真的很想去看看
I really wanted to see

118
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:09,342
老实泉
Old Faithful.

119
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:12,011
我们随时都可以去黄石公园
We can go to Yellowstone anytime.

120
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:14,180
现在 我们留在这里帮助
Right now, it's more important we stay here

121
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:16,098
马克更重要
to help Mark.

122
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,350
你没事吧
Are you okay?

123
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:24,690
我很抱歉 我很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

124
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,194
巴里
Barry- -

125
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,278
巴里 拜托
Barry, please.

126
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,744
是吗
Are you?

127
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:40,414
如果马克的计划不成功
If Mark's plan doesn't work

128
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:41,958
必须成功
- It has to.

129
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:47,630
我 我 我
*I, I, I, I*

130
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,881
我想要
*I feel like*

131
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:50,591
我想跳舞
*I feel like dancing*

132
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,814
请你喝一杯吧 帅哥
Buy you a drink, handsome?

133
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:07,400
我还在
One of us

134
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:08,526
上班呢
is still working.

135
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,946
我今晚一定会把月度最佳员工的徽章
I'll be sure to leave that Employee of the Month badge

136
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,239
放在你那半床上
on your side of the bed tonight.

137
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:17,285
可以关门了吗
Good to close up?

138
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,704
我可以让阿善堤关
I could get Ashanti to do it.

139
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,415
不行 我得自己挣钱养活自己
Ah, nah- - gotta earn my keep.

140
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:24,208
我听说老板特别混蛋
I hear the boss is a real jerk.

141
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:25,584
是吗
Oh, yeah?

142
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,464
-回家见  -好
See you at home. Okay.

143
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,383
我想跳舞
*I feel like dancing*

144
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,517
晚安
Good night.

145
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,324
如果你想找工作
if you're looking for a gig,

146
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,783
明天是业余之夜
amateur night's tomorrow.

147
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:00,328
我可不是外行 哈特利
I'm no amateur, Hartley,

148
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,246
而我已经有工作了
and I already have a gig

149
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:23,809
出来吧 哈特利
Aw, come on out, Hartley.

150
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,145
我保证我会很快
I promise to make it quick.

151
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:28,064
你只用
All you have to do is

152
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,815
听听音乐就好
listen to the music.

153
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,578
你是谁 你到底想干什么
Who are you, and what the hell do you want?

154
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,872
你可以叫我提琴手
You can call me The Fiddler,

155
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,499
我是来毁掉你的美好夜晚的
and I'm here to ruin your night.

156
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,860
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

157
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:17,655
你有我需要的东西
You have something I need.

158
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:24,328
哈特利
Hartleyl

159
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,871
哈特利
Hartley.

160
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:32,253
告诉你老板我会回来的
Tell your boss I'll be back.

161
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:39,302
哈特利
Hartley!

162
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,395
没事的
- It's okay.

163
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:52,106
记住你是在做正确的事
Just remember you're doing the right thing.

164
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:57,403
我希望如此
- I sure hope so.

165
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:06,329
好 斯诺准备好了
AII right. Snow's ready.

166
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:07,455
抱歉
Excuse me.

167
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,603
我从没真正了解过她
I never really got to know her.

168
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,980
我们知道她非常勇敢
Well, we know she's brave as hell.

169
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,068
这需要多久
How long will this take?

170
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,945
需要多久就多久
Oh, as long as it needs to.

171
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:40,446
等等
Hold on.

172
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,657
神经传导率读数正在飙升
The neural conductivity readouts are surging.

173
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,450
马克 我们收到了超光速粒子反馈
Mark, we got tachyon feedback.

174
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:48,371
等等 有点不对劲
Hold on. Something's not right here.

175
00:10:58,382 --> 00:10:59,590
你在搞什么
What the hell are you doing?

176
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:00,925
我是想救她的命
Trying to save her lifel

177
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:02,343
你不能打断这个过程
You can't interrupt this process!

178
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,011
你得马上把她放回去
You have to get her back inside right nowl

179
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,138
马克 切斯特 怎么了
Mark! Chester, what happened?

180
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,974
我不知道 我只是提供了
- I don't know. All I did was provide

181
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,518
一个稳定的电源 那是不会引发这个情况的
a stable power source. That wouldn't cause this.

182
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,811
他没说会疼
He didn't say this would hurt.

183
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:14,647
他只是说这会让她们复活
He just said it would bring them back.

184
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,648
她们
Them?

185
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:18,651
你是说凯特琳吗
You mean Caitlin?

186
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,947
不是
No.

187
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,324
她指的是凯特琳和冰霜
She means Caitlin and Frost.

188
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:28,661
马克 你所做的一切都是为了冰霜 对吧
Mark, everything you've done has been for Frost, hasn't it?

189
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:30,496
所以你才没提过她
That's why you haven't mentioned her.

190
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:31,706
这和凯特琳无关
This wasn't about Caitlin.

191
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:32,832
这是为了让冰霜复活
This was about bringing Frost back,

192
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,083
不是吗
wasn't it?

193
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,003
马克 不是吗
Mark, wasn't it?

194
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:38,963
凯 凯特琳不该
Cai- - Caitlin wasn't supposed

195
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:39,964
独自回来的 巴里
to come back alone, Barry.

196
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,716
她们都是
They both were.

197
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,009
天
God

198
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,302
试图将她们俩带回来
Trying to bring them both back,

199
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:45,803
导致了故障
that must've caused the malfunction.

200
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:47,763
只有这样才解释的通
It's the only thing that makes sense.

201
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,432
你为什么骗我们
Why did you lie to us?

202
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,644
因为我不能信任你们任何一个
Cause I can't trust any of you...

203
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,980
尤其是你 巴里
you most of all, Barry.

204
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:57,815
所以我们当初才不得不
That's why we had to build the CRC in secret

205
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,066
私底下建造了冷冻舱
in the first place,

206
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,693
因为凯特琳知道
because Caitlin knew that you

207
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:01,861
你公再次阻止她的
would try to stop her again

208
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:03,070
马克
Mark,

209
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,531
伙计 这样不对
man, this- this isn't right.

210
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,783
抱歉 闪电侠小队们
- I'm sorry, Team Flash.

211
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:09,452
就因为你们都放弃了冰霜
Just because you all gave up on Frost

212
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:12,330
不 等于我也可以
doesn't mean that I can.

213
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:13,998
我永远不能
I never will.

214
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,013
是马克吗
Is that Mark?

215
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:30,556
不是 是入侵者警告
No, it's an intruder alert.

216
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,558
实验室有人闯入
The med lab's been breached.

217
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:33,768
你留这
Stay here.

218
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,650
-哈特利  -凯特琳在哪
Hartley? - Where's Caitlin?

219
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,110
-我需要一个医生  -她走了
I need a doctor. - She's away.

220
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:46,155
声波 阻碍了我正常的心跳节奏
Soundwaves...short- circuiting my heart's natural rhythm,

221
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,657
我怎么 我是说
How do I I mean- -

222
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,033
用音速腕带
Use the sonic cuff.

223
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,410
-音速腕带  -最底下的抽屉
Sonic? - The bottom drawer!

224
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:52,453
底层抽屉
Bottom drawer!

225
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,873
给
There. -

226
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,250
你没事了吧
Are you good?

227
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:06,467
-还好吗  -怎么这么慢啊 艾伦
You okay? - Took you long enough, Allen.

228
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,260
抱歉 我不知道
- I'msorry. I mean, I didn't know- -

229
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:09,553
你说底层抽屉 但其实在顶层
you said the bottom drawer. It was in the top drawer.

230
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:10,763
我甚至不知道你
I didn't even know what you- -

231
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:12,348
无所谓了 让我休息一下
Never mind. Let me rest.

232
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,225
天
Oh, gosh.

233
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:17,228
心率失常短期好不起来
This arrythmia isn't going away anytime soon.

234
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,272
腕带只能缓解 不能治愈
Cuff's a patch, not a cure.

235
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:21,983
-好  -哈特利
Okay. Hartley?

236
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:22,984
是哈特利
- It's Hartley, yeah. It's...

237
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,026
你怎么进来的
How did you get in here,

238
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,319
你出了什么事
and what happened to you?

239
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,863
-首先 我过去在这工作  -太好了
One, I used to work here- Great.

240
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:30,283
第二 某个乐师精神病
And two, some musical psycho

241
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,493
用她的杀人小提琴袭击了我
attacked me with her murder violin- -

242
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,577
说她自己叫提琴手
calls herself The Fiddler.

243
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:36,831
就是她袭击了你吗
- Is this who attacked you?

244
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:38,291
她叫伊兹·鲍温
Her name is Izzy Bowen,

245
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,793
上次见面的时候我们成了朋友
only we were friends the last time we met.

246
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:43,546
不用因为我就不再跟伊兹做朋友了
Oh, well, no need to unfriend Izzy on my account.

247
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:44,922
不是她
It's not her.

248
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,882
巴里 两天出来俩坏人
Barry, that's two new Rogues in two days,

249
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,134
现在马克也在骗我们
and now Mark is lying to us too

250
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:49,385
天堂也有麻烦了
Trouble in paradise?

251
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,678
-拜托了  -别担心
Please. - Don't worry about it.

252
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,638
我来对付马克
I'lI handle Mark.

253
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:53,848
无聊
Bored.

254
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,434
唾觉
Sleeping now.

255
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:10,114
你的升级没起作用啊
Your upgrade didn't work.

256
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:11,991
别误会
Don't get me wrong.

257
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:14,660
我喜欢这小提琴
I love the fiddle and all.

258
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,206
你让我失望了
You failed me.

259
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,876
这就是代价
This is the price.

260
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,715
我不允许失败
Failing is not an option.

261
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:29,842
现在把我要的给我
Now bring me what I want,

262
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:33,012
否则下次你死定了
or next time, you die.

263
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,223
我说清楚了吗
Am I clear?

264
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,516
是的
Yes,

265
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,977
非常清楚
very.

266
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:41,896
抱歉
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,215
再来一轮
Another round.

268
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,884
算了 干脆来一整瓶吧
You know what? Just make it the whole bottle.

269
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,429
那也没办法带她回来
- It still won't bring her back.

270
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,891
我只是想谈谈
I just wanna talk.

271
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,735
你只是在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

272
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,946
你搞砸了 马克
And you screwed up, Mark- -

273
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:33,072
而且很严重
badly.

274
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:35,032
是啊
Yeah.

275
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:36,826
我知道你为什么这么做
- I know why you did it.

276
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,494
好吧
Okay.

277
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,746
你继续说教
No, go ahead. Enlighten me.

278
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,416
因为你全心全意的爱着冰霜
Because you loved Frost

279
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,252
现在还爱着
with all your heart. You still do.

280
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,840
有时候 当我们爱一个人很深时
Sometimes, when we love someone like that,

281
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:52,967
就会为了正确的理由
we do the wrong things

282
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,469
做出错误的事
for the right reasons.

283
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,932
我知道 我也这样过
I know I have.

284
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,395
拜托
Please.

285
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:06,772
你是说你不再生我气了吗
Are you saying you're not mad at me anymore?

286
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:09,066
不  我还在气
No, I am,

287
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:12,445
但我知道你为什么撒谎了
but I understand why you lied.

288
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:14,947
但有件事你也要明白
But there's something you need to understand now too:

289
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,198
我们该如何去做
how we operate.

290
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:22,163
你现在也是团队的一员
You are a part of this team now,

291
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:25,249
也就是说我们会支持你
and that means we have your back,

292
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,960
但你也要支持我们
but you need to have ours,

293
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:30,504
也就是说
which also means no more

294
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,340
不能再欺骗我们了
going rogue.

295
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:35,301
马克
Mark

296
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:39,180
如果你接受我们
If you let us in,

297
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:42,767
我们一起努力
we work together,

298
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,685
就能将不可能变成可能
we can do the impossible.

299
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:51,025
但我们必须团结一致
But we have to stick together.

300
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:58,407
我们得立刻走了
We have to go right now.

301
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,617
-去哪  -立刻
Go where? - Right now.

302
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,785
-哪啊  -快
Where? - Come on.

303
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:04,163
这也是团队合作之一吗
Is this, like, one of those team things?

304
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,540
什么叫这永远不能成功
What do you mean this was never gonna work?

305
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,126
我对冷冻舱做了全面的诊断
- I ran a full diagnostic on the CRC,

306
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,628
试图弄清楚到底哪儿出了问题
trying to figure out what went wrong,

307
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,172
最后发现 神经DNA
and what I found was, neural DNA

308
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,675
无法释放冰霜的意识
could never unlock Frost's consciousness.

309
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:19,387
我们需要内源性神经印记来实现这一目标
We need endogenous neural imprints to make this work.

310
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,180
好吗
Okay?

311
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:22,598
但你说的是凯特琳的思维图谱
But you're talking about a literal map

312
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,933
我们去哪能找到
of Caitlin's mind. Where are we gonna find

313
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,184
这种东西呢
something like that?

314
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,645
托马斯·斯诺
Thomas Snow.

315
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,522
凯特琳的父亲
Caitlin's dad?

316
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:30,982
他死了
He's dead.

317
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:32,525
不 艾瑞斯说的对
No, Iris is right.

318
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,694
托马斯·斯诺将冰霜的意识
Thomas Snow attached Frost's consciousness

319
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:36,696
附到了儿时凯特琳的身上
to Caitlin when she was a child.

320
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:38,489
凯特琳在自己的公寓里
Caitlin downloaded everything she could find

321
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,408
将她能找到的所有电子文档都下载了
from his digital files at her apartment,

322
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,201
说纸质文件和其它所有的文件都存在
said that the hard copies and all the rest are in storage

323
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,704
坦豪斯的实验室 有很多 但是
at Tannhauser Labs. Now, it's a lot, but

324
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:46,038
我们在凯特琳家见
Meet me at Caitlin's.

325
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:48,541
我去问问坦豪斯实验室的卡拉
I'lI check in with Carla at Tannhauser.

326
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,210
切斯特 你和马克准备好冷冻舱
Chester, you and Mark get to work on the CRC.

327
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:53,337
等我们找到了所需的东西
Once we find what we're looking for,

328
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,548
就会把凯特琳还有冰霜
we're gonna bring back Caitlin

329
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,174
一起带回来
and Frost.

330
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,856
我已经把泛音输入了
I entered the harmonics already.

331
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,067
现在快点吧 我知道
Now, come on. I know this.

332
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:17,445
法拉克
Frak.

333
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,744
见鬼
Damn it

334
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:26,954
为什么不工作呢
Why aren't you working?

335
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:28,414
你还好吗
Are you okay?

336
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:32,043
你是冰霜的另一个姐妹吧
Well, you're obviously the other Snow sister.

337
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:36,464
实际上我现在有点忙 你不介意吧
Actually, I'm kind of busy, if you don't mind.

338
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:37,840
你在忙什么
What are you working on?

339
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,593
我的声波手套
My sonic gauntlets- -

340
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:41,761
关你啥事
why do you care?

341
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:44,138
我不是想管你的声波手套
Oh, I don't- about your gauntlets.

342
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,265
只是你刚才好像很疼
You just seemed like you were in pain.

343
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,184
出什么事了吗
What's wrong?

344
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,353
我的心率不稳定 极其危险
- I have a dangerously erratic heart rate

345
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,563
因为一个朋克女巫
due to some punk witch

346
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:55,399
在我不觉察的情况下袭击了我
who caught me with my guard down.

347
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:58,194
但下次就不会这样了
But that won't be a problem next time,

348
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,154
因为我要把我的手套功率提高
because I'm boosting my gauntlet's efficiency

349
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:02,114
百分之四百
by 400%.

350
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:04,659
为什么
Why?

351
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:06,452
算了 你别问了行吗
You know, actually, it doesn't matter.

352
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:10,873
就一边呆着去
If you could just, please, go away or something...

353
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,169
好吧
Okay,

354
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:16,796
我来问你哈
I'm gonna make this easy.

355
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:18,214
你有凯特琳·斯诺的
Do you have any of Caitlin Snow's

356
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:19,256
医疗知识吗
medical knowledge?

357
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:20,466
-没有  -没有哈
No. No, okay,

358
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,343
那你的手或者眼睛
um, can you shoot ice

359
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,470
能射出冰霜吗
from your hands or eyes?

360
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,180
随便哪都行
Either is acceptable.

361
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,350
-不能  -不能 那你就帮不到我
No. No- - then you can't help me,

362
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:31,852
所以你一点用都没有
and therefore, you are uselessl

363
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:34,563
所以我拜托你离开我吧
So please leave me alo-

364
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,069
你现在不应该再工作了
You shouldn't be working right now

365
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,113
或者生气的问别人一些奇怪的问题
or angrily asking people weird questions.

366
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:45,032
太烦心了
It's disturbing.

367
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,660
我必须弄好这个
I have to finish this.

368
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,413
你害怕有人会找到你吗
Are you scared that person will find you?

369
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,373
我相信巴里和其他人一定会
Because I'm sure Barry and the others have-

370
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,667
我得离开这 明白吗
I have to get out of here, okay?

371
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,710
如果我不
If I don't...

372
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,048
你不担心自己受伤
You're not afraid of getting hurt.

373
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:04,593
你担心其他人会受伤
You're afraid of someone else getting hurt.

374
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,221
你认为他们有危险
You think they're in danger.

375
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:09,307
所以我才
And that is why

376
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:12,226
必须要完成这件事
I have to finish these:

377
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:14,186
这样才能保证他安全
so I can keep him safe...

378
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,149
也是我唯一能做的
The only way that I can.

379
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,612
你要去杀了那个朋克女巫
You're going to kill the punk witch?

380
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:26,490
不 不行 杀戮是不对的
Oh, no. Killing is wrong.

381
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,745
中城的超能人类暴力事件
And Central City has more meta- violence per capita

382
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,830
要比其他城市都多
than any other city in the world.

383
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:35,333
你不是会杀人的那种人 我能看出来的
You're not a killer. I can tell.

384
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,959
你又不了解我
You don't know me.

385
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,337
其实 我可以很诚实的说
Actually- - and I can say this quite truthfully-

386
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,714
我觉得我了解你比了解自己都深
I think I know you better than I know myself.

387
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,343
之前我是个超能罪犯
- I used to be a meta- criminal,

388
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,553
像他们说的一样 是个恶棍
a Rogue, as they say.

389
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,722
我总会伤害别人
I used to hurt people all the time,

390
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,223
并乐在其中
and I enjoyed it.

391
00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:53,893
是什么改变了你呢
What changed you?

392
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:57,146
是罗德里克 行了吗
Oh, Roderick, okay?

393
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,190
罗德里克
Roderick.

394
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:02,234
你为了保护他而做出了改变
You changed to keep him safe?

395
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:04,236
真是不错呢
That's beautiful.

396
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:08,324
但这并不等同于彻底的改头换面
But that's not real change,

397
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,992
对不对
is it?

398
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,869
为了你所爱的人而做出的改变
Deciding to change for the person you love

399
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:15,164
并不代表那就是你心之所向
doesn't mean you've decided who you wanna be.

400
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,918
那是个你要为你自己而做出的选择
That's a choice you still have to make for yourself,

401
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,002
对不对
isn't it?

402
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:48,114
拜托请告诉我
Please tell me

403
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:49,782
你有所发现
you found something.

404
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:52,076
我们得把凯特琳跟冰霜弄回来
We have to get Caitlin and Frost back.

405
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,578
做不到
We can't.

406
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:04,588
这是真的吗
- Is this really true?

407
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:07,174
我读了十几遍
- I read it a dozen times.

408
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:08,926
在他最初的实验中
In his original experiment,

409
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,804
托马斯·斯诺试图创造出个凯特琳2.0版
Thomas Snow tried to create a Caitlin 2. 0,

410
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:13,848
能对肌萎缩性脊髓侧索硬化症免疫的版本
one that would be immune to ALS,

411
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,142
但相反 他创造出了一个
but instead, he created a daughter

412
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:18,686
有两种混合意识的女儿
with two mixed consciousnesses,

413
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:20,313
当他试图逆转的时候
and when he tried to reverse it,

414
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:21,814
发现
he found out

415
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:25,359
逆转过程会杀掉二者之一
the process would kill one of them.

416
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,445
这也是托马斯从没建造自己冷冻舱的原因
That's why Thomas never built his own CRC,

417
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:30,656
因为他同时爱着凯特琳跟冰霜
because he loved both Caitlin and Frost.

418
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:34,118
他不忍心失去任何一个
He couldn't bear to lose either of them.

419
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:36,454
就像我们一样
Just like us.

420
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:39,415
巴里 要是斯诺进到了那台机器中
Barry, if Snow goes into that machine,

421
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,793
然后凯特琳跟冰霜只能回来一个
and only Caitlin or Frost can come back

422
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:44,503
我们得选择
We're gonna have to choose

423
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:45,963
带哪个回来
who to bring back.

424
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,602
凯特琳跟我说的最后一件事
You know, the last thing Caitlin said to me

425
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,021
就是她永远不会停止复活冰霜
was that she'd never stop trying to bring back Frost.

426
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,856
我们要尊重她的意愿 尊重她的计划
We need to honor her by honoring her plan.

427
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:05,900
马克 我们都清楚
Mark, we're all pretty clear

428
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:08,736
你的意见了 我想听听大家意见
on your opinion. I wanna hear everybody else's.

429
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,698
好吧
Okay.

430
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,117
我支持复活冰霜
I vote to bring back Frost

431
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,535
马克说的对
Mark's right

432
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,120
凯特琳帮我们选好了
Caitlin chose for us.

433
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:22,959
这本就是她的计划 所以选择冰霜就是尊重她
This was her plan, so choosing Frost honors her.

434
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,502
对不对 查克
Right, Chuck?

435
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,254
查克
Chuck?

436
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:30,341
不好意思 但是
sorry, but, uh,

437
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,884
不是
but no.

438
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:34,345
爱兰歌娜 当初死亡风暴把我爸复活
Allegra, look, when Deathstorm brought my dad back,

439
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:36,222
教会了我一件事
it taught me one thing:

440
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,182
就是复活死者
that resurrecting the dead

441
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,684
是反自然的
is unnatural.

442
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:43,104
现在 我不想选
Now, I don't wanna choose,

443
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:45,523
但非让我选的话
but if I have to,

444
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:47,441
我选择凯特琳
I'd choose Caitlin,

445
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:50,194
因为从科学层面上来说
cause when I run through the science,

446
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:52,738
这样才是最合理的
it's what makes the most sense to me.

447
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,410
二比一
it's two to one.

448
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:00,621
我猜猜
Let me guess:

449
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:02,290
你支持切斯特对不对
you're with Chester, right?

450
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:06,085
这样 你的超级老公就能跟你一起选凯特琳了
That way, your super- hubby can tip tl e scales to Caitlin.

451
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,671
不是 我选择冰霜
Uh, no I choose Frost.

452
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:13,426
我有自己的理由 但这就是我想选的
I have my reasons, but that's how I feel.

453
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,764
那就是三比一了
Well, it's three to one.

454
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,975
我需要多些时间考虑一下
I just need more time to think about it.

455
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:24,478
想考虑多久都随你 老大
Well, think about it all you want, boss man,

456
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,189
但八小时之后 我就动手了
but in eight hours, I'm doing this,

457
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,066
不管你同不同意 如果你想阻止我
with or without you, and if you try to stop me,

458
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:32,278
后果出了什么事都只能怪你自己
you'll have no one but yourself to blame for the fallout.

459
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:34,614
他可以怪我
He can blame me.

460
00:24:39,536 --> 00:24:42,747
你们是一家人
You all are a family.

461
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:45,458
现在却出现分歧 这都是我的错
Now you're being torn apart, and it's all my fault?

462
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,961
我希望自己从没出生过
I wish I'd never been born.

463
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,488
有史以来最烂的一天
Worst day ever.

464
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,743
斯诺错了
Snow is wrong.

465
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,244
不是她的错
It's not her fault.

466
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,704
是我的
It's mine.

467
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:27,458
在我摧毁凯特琳实验室之前
The last thing I said to Caitlin

468
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,711
跟她说的最后一句话是
before I destroyed her lab was,

469
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:33,506
对不起
I'm sorry. "

470
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,593
事实上 我并不觉得抱歉
The truth is, I wasn't.

471
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:41,889
巴里 我之所以选择冰霜
Barry, the reason that I chose Frost

472
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:44,558
是因为第一次在我有机会的时候
was because I didn't choose her the first time,

473
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,603
我没有选她
when I had the chance.

474
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,940
这也是我选择复活冰霜的原因
That's why I chose to bring Frost back:

475
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,526
因为她活着的时候 我并没有选择她
because I didn't choose her when she was alive.

476
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,654
怎么了
What is it?

477
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:58,239
凯特琳踏入冷冻舱的那一刻
The moment Caitlin stepped

478
00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:01,867
她已经做出了决定
into the CRC, she made her own choice

479
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,619
决定自己想要什么
about what she wanted,

480
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:05,329
自己想成为谁
who she wanted to be.

481
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:07,540
要我们一直以来
And what if we've been

482
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:09,542
都想错了呢
thinking about this all wrong?

483
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,629
我知道我们要做什么了
I know what we need to do.

484
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,240
你好
Hello.

485
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:45,202
你叫 斯诺 对吧
It's, uh, Snow, right?

486
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:46,746
塞西尔
Cecile,

487
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,955
超能人类律师
meta- human attorney

488
00:26:47,998 --> 00:26:50,249
以及超能人类英雄
and meta- human superhero.

489
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,170
马克跟我提起过你
Mark told me all about you.

490
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,632
你喜欢这个天气吗
You enjoying the weather?

491
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:59,800
我喜欢下雨
I love the rain.

492
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:01,427
我喜欢大自然所有现象
I love all of nature.

493
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,096
会让我感觉
It just- - it makes me feel so

494
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,598
很平静
at peace.

495
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:08,976
是 能看出来
Yeah, I can see that.

496
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:12,104
这是因为自然万物都有其目的
- It's because everything in nature has a purpose.

497
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:13,648
就像你一样 你也有目的
just like you. You have a purpose.

498
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,274
你会帮助别人
You help people.

499
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,735
我只是
I just

500
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,196
我希望知道自己的目的是什么
I wish I knew what my purpose was.

501
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:23,574
感觉很奇怪
It's strange.

502
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:28,371
现在 我感觉自己跟所有生物都紧密相连
Right now, I feel so connected to all living things,

503
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,791
却又如此孤立
and yet so disconnected

504
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,209
无援
and alone.

505
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,585
你知道你是第一个
Do you know that you're the first person

506
00:27:34,628 --> 00:27:37,254
我读不懂你感受的人吗
whose feelings I can't read?

507
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:38,923
一般来说
Usually,

508
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:40,758
出现这种情况我会担心
ooh, that is something I'd be worried about,

509
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,385
但现在却说不好了
but I don't know.

510
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,555
这次并没有担心
Not this time.

511
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:50,101
不知怎么了 你给人感觉就像个朋友
Somehow, you just seem like a friend.

512
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:52,812
那咱们就做朋友吧
Then let's be.

513
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:55,314
朋友
Friends.

514
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:56,482
很好笑吗
Was that funny?

515
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:57,942
我是个有意思的人吗
Am I a funny person?

516
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,735
那就太好了
That would be nice.

517
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,778
你是个很真诚的人
You are very genuine,

518
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,530
这种人很罕见的
and that is rare.

519
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:04,073
谢了
Thanks.

520
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:07,785
我听说其他队员
So I heard about what the rest of the team

521
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,496
投票的事了
was voting on.

522
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,540
我得跟你说
I gotta tell ya.

523
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:16,043
讲真 我不清楚如果自己在场
I honestly don't know how I would've voted,

524
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:19,130
会投给谁 乔会投给谁
had I been there, or Joe.

525
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:21,507
所以
So...

526
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,218
我想问你个问题  一般来说这问题不需要问的
I'm gonna ask you a question that I usually don't have to.

527
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,140
你现在感觉如何
How are you feeling right now?

528
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:30,766
尽管我的存在
Even though my entire existence

529
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,393
就是个谜
is a mystery,

530
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:35,354
首先 不管我是谁
one, whoever I am,

531
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,648
我喜欢我自己
I like myself,

532
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:38,899
其次
and two...

533
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:43,195
我不想回到那个金属盒子里去
I don't wanna go back inside that metal box.

534
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:46,574
现在我很担心大家
And now I'm afraid of the decision

535
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,284
会做出什么决定
the team will make.

536
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,457
你应该自己来做决定
You should make the decision for yourself.

537
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,584
-真的吗  -真的
Really? Yeah.

538
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:59,003
我们看了托马斯关于冰霜跟斯诺的
We looked at Thomas'original files

539
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:00,630
原始档案
on Frost and Snow.

540
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,132
冰霜被创造出来的时候
When Frost was created,

541
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,135
托马斯没有擅自决定他女儿应该是谁
Thomas didn't try to decide who his daughter should be.

542
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,221
他后退了一步 让她们自行决定
He took a step back, and he let'em figure it out.

543
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:13,601
所以使用冷冻舱选择你应该是谁
So using the CRC and choosing who you should be,

544
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:15,436
这不是由我们决定的
that's not our choice to make.

545
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,855
只有你自己才能觉得要成为谁
Only you can decide who you're gonna be.

546
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:22,944
行吧 那我们就这么办了
Ooh, okay, this is what we're doing.

547
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,405
轮到我了
Okay, my turn.

548
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,493
你做出决定了吗
So you've made a decision?

549
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,786
还没
Not even,

550
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:33,621
但不管我做出什么决定
but whatever decision I make,

551
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:34,789
都是我自愿的
it'll be mine...

552
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,666
纯自愿
all mine.

553
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,010
怎么了
What is it?

554
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,428
市中心发生了大规模的声波袭击
- It was a massive sonic attack downtown.

555
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:50,805
应该是我们的提琴手朋友回来
It looks like our Fiddler friend is back

556
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:52,098
准备大干一场了
and ready to rumble.

557
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,516
等下 那里是哈特利的喀拉喀托俱乐部
Wait, that's Hartley's Krakatoa Club.

558
00:29:58,146 --> 00:29:59,772
他去找提琴手了
He's gone after The Fiddler.

559
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:02,191
可他伤还没好 为什么不找人帮忙
- If he's still hurt, why didn't he ask for help?

560
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,694
他不想你们帮忙
He doesn't want your help.

561
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,281
他终于做了决定
He finally made his choice.

562
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,583
我看着像是开玩笑吗
Does it look like I'm playing?

563
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:24,505
最后问一次 哈特利·拉维在哪儿
For the last time, where is Hartley Rathaway?

564
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:38,269
-拜托  -放他走
Please Let him go.

565
00:30:38,312 --> 00:30:40,229
哈特利
Hartley.

566
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,607
我就知道 如果我不断给你施压的话
I knew, if I put the squeeze on your squeeze,

567
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:44,984
你迟早是会现身的
you'd show up sooner or later.

568
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:47,737
来得也挺及时 因为我已经开始厌倦
Just in time, too, cause I was starting to get bored

569
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,739
折磨你的手下了
of torturing your employees.

570
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,742
她把他们全杀了
She killed them all

571
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,909
全部雇员
the whole crew.

572
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:56,370
我有说过
Did I mention

573
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:59,332
还有生不如死的命运吗
that there are fates worse than death?

574
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,731
结束了 提琴手
- It's over, Fiddler.

575
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:25,483
你无能为力
You're powerless

576
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:27,360
又寡不敌众
and outnumbered.

577
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:33,032
闪电侠
Oh, Flash.

578
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:35,785
你来看我的演出了
You came to my show.

579
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:39,956
你看 乐器只是工具而已
See, instruments are just a tool.

580
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,212
真正的艺术家会使用自身的能力
A real artist uses what's inside them

581
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:07,817
是时候达到我的此行目的了
Time to get what I came for.

582
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,076
你喜欢我的升级吗
How do you like my upgrade?

583
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,412
不要 住手
Don't. Stop

584
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,622
斯诺告诉了我你说的话
Snow told me what you said.

585
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:22,915
你不必这样做的
You don't have to do this.

586
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,709
你还可以另选出路
You can still choose another way.

587
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:26,919
太晚了
It's too late.

588
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:30,047
她把罗德里克害死了
Roderick is dead because of her.

589
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:31,507
我现在没有生活的目标了
I have nothing to live for now.

590
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,092
你还有的
Yes, you do.

591
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:34,093
我给你看
I'lI show you.

592
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:56,991
提琴手没有杀死他们
The Fiddler didn't kill them.

593
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:00,077
他们被困在一个震动相里
They're trapped in a vibrational phase.

594
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:01,954
可是需要你的手套救他们出来
But they need your gauntlets to get them out.

595
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:33,653
你做了正确的选择
You made the right choice.

596
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:37,281
并在此过程中重置了一些东西
And reset things in the process.

597
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:46,540
你今天救了很多人命
You saved a lot of lives today

598
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,251
你打算怎么处置提琴手
What do you wanna do with The Fiddler?

599
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:50,586
你自己做主
You figure it out.

600
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:51,671
我没空
I'm busy.

601
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,219
看看他
Aw, look at hfm,

602
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:00,388
像只迷路的流浪狗一样四处游荡
wandering around like a lost puppy.

603
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,555
你还好吗
You all right there?

604
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:03,891
不好 我们达到了此行目的
No. We got what we came for.

605
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:05,268
现在赶紧离开这里
Now let's get the hell out of here.

606
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:11,315
是莫瑟
- It was Mercer.

607
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,402
他带走了提琴手
He took The Fiddler.

608
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,116
还有我的手套
And my gauntlets.

609
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,792
她叫安德里亚·沃泽克
Her name is Andrea Wozzeck.

610
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,044
原来她也在跟欧文·莫瑟合作
Turns out she's also working with Owen Mercer.

611
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:34,422
大家都不知道原因
Why is anyone's guess.

612
00:34:34,464 --> 00:34:36,799
超级坏蛋也组队了 这下好了
Supervillain team- up, great.

613
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:39,844
他们为什么想要哈特利的手套呢
So do we know why they want Hartley's gauntlet?

614
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,554
-这重要吗  -呃
Do we care? - Uh

615
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:45,057
我现在最关心的是
Look, the only thing that I'm concerned about right now

616
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,101
你是怎么决定的
is, "What did you decide?

617
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,437
我没做任何决定
I didn't decide anything.

618
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:50,438
是斯诺决定的
Snow did.

619
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,189
她已经告诉了其他人
She already told everybody else.

620
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:55,234
是时候也告诉你了
I guess now it's time she tells you too.

621
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,613
那怎么
What is.

622
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:02,950
我知道你一直过得很不好
- I know that this has been difficult for you,

623
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:07,872
不管我作何决定 都会对你产生巨大影响
and that whatever decision I make will affect you a lot,

624
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:09,999
可是都比不上对我的影响
but not as much as it will affect me

625
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,585
这是我的命运
This is my fate,

626
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:14,420
我的未来
my future,

627
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:17,048
我的生活
my life.

628
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,759
我不要回到冷冻舱里去
I'm not going back inside the CRC.

629
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,844
什么
What?

630
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,096
我要走自己的路
- I'm gonna choose my own path

631
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:27,141
过自己的生活
and be my own person,

632
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,102
不管这条路通往哪里
whoever that ends up being.

633
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,315
就这样吗
That's it?

634
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,150
难道我就该忘掉冰霜
What, I'm just supposed to forget about Frost

635
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,236
-接受这一切吗  -对
and accept this? - Yes,

636
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:41,572
因为这不是我的选择
because I didn't choose this.

637
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:42,490
是凯特琳的选择
Caitlin did

638
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:44,867
她创造了一个人
when she created a person

639
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,786
一个富有感情
with feelings

640
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:49,121
有自由意志的人
and free will,

641
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:50,164
我不会放弃这一切
and I won't give that up

642
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:51,791
去成为另一个人
to become someone I'm not.

643
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,168
拜托 你自己连个名字都没有
Please, you don't even have your own name.

644
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:56,796
其实我有的
Actually, I do.

645
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:59,423
我今天才发现 父亲一直梦想着
I found out today that my father always dreamed

646
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:00,967
创造新事物
of creating something

647
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:03,970
或者新生命
or someone new,

648
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:06,973
他取名为喀俄涅
and he called her Khione.

649
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:09,976
科学犹如大自然
But science is like nature.

650
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,811
可以很残酷
It can be cruel

651
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:14,188
也可以很美丽
as well as beautiful.

652
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:16,607
不管怎样 我们都控制不了
Either way, we can't control it.

653
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:21,988
我知道凯特琳和冰霜已经消失了
So I know Caitlin and Frost are gone,

654
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,323
我们可以悼念藤蔓上
and we can mourn the flowers

655
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:26,909
凋零的花朵
that have fallen from the vine,

656
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,078
但是我们不能要求新开的骨朵
but we can't ask a new bloom

657
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:32,665
放弃自己的生命来挽回之前的鲜花
to give up its place in exchange.

658
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,334
希望你能够接受这一点
I hope you can accept that.

659
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:38,129
希望你能够接受我
I hope you can accept me,

660
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:39,797
因为我想活下去
cause I'd like to live

661
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,216
跟你们所有人一起成长
and grow with all of you.

662
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:43,718
我们也希望这样
We want that too.

663
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:47,847
你必须马上进去 好吗
You need to get inside right now, okay?

664
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:51,434
这是我们的计划 一直以来的计划
That was always the plan. That was our plan.

665
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,060
那是凯特琳的计划
That was Caitlin's plan!

666
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:55,313
计划有变
Plans change.

667
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:16,000
你知道自己刚干了什么蠢事吗
Do you realize what you've just done?

668
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:18,127
知道
Yeah.

669
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,337
帮助了一位新朋友
I just helped a new friend.

670
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:29,305
下次等我见到你
The next time that I see you,

671
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:31,223
一定要把你拿下
I am taking you down.

672
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:33,225
马克
Mark

673
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:42,401
看来你已经完全恢复了
Looks like you're back to 100%.

674
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,654
雨停了
- It stopped raining.

675
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,449
马克会好起来吗
- Is Mark gonna be okay?

676
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,285
希望会吧
I hope so.

677
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:08,344
阳光明媚
Well, the sun is shining,

678
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:09,595
我们坚持了一周
and we made it through the week.

679
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:11,931
而且毫发无损
Mm, and in one piece at that.

680
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:14,141
尽管很难相信
And even though it's hard

681
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:15,434
我们再也见不到
to believe that we'll never see

682
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,936
凯特琳或者冰霜了
Caitlin or Frost again,

683
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:20,690
我还是替喀俄涅高兴
I am happy for Khione.

684
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,859
我知道你的意思
Yeah, I know what you mean.

685
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,821
所以我一直告诉自己
That's why I keep telling myself that

686
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:30,616
冰霜自愿成为地狱冰霜与死亡风暴战斗
Frost chose to become Hellfrost and fight Deathstorm,

687
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:33,661
就像凯特琳自愿进入冷冻舱
just like Caitlin chose to go into the CRC,

688
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:37,123
现在喀俄涅也做了自己的选择
and now Khione's made her choice too.

689
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:38,624
对
Yeah.

690
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,209
我觉得新版凯特琳
Is it crazy to think that this

691
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:41,502
就是她一直想成为的样子
new version of Caitlin is what

692
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:44,505
这想法荒谬吗
she would've wanted all along?

693
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,466
一点也不
No, not at all.

694
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:50,094
我觉得她会喜欢这个自己的
I think she'd like her.

695
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,348
那么
So?

696
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,561
周末有什么计划吗
Got any weekend plans?

697
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:01,439
其实我在想
Actually, I was thinking

698
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:03,357
我们可以去看间歇泉
we could take in a geyser.

699
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:27,840
坐在这里 吞噬我的内心 等待
*Sittin'here, eatin'my heart out, waitin'*

700
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:30,885
等待爱人的到来
*Waitin'for some lover to come*

701
00:39:32,346 --> 00:39:34,263
拨了无数个号码
*Dialed about a thousand numbers*

702
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:37,350
你真会跳舞
You are a great dancer!

703
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:41,312
乔真会站着不动
And Joe is very good at standing stilll

704
00:39:41,355 --> 00:39:43,314
你真幽默
You are funny!

705
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:47,360
我需要一些热辣恋人 宝贝 今晚
*I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight*

706
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:52,323
我需要一些热辣恋人 今晚
*Iwant some hot stuff, baby, this evening*

707
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:54,075
必须有热辣恋人
*Gotta have some hot stuff*

708
00:39:54,117 --> 00:39:57,036
今晚必须有热辣恋人

709
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,120
热辣
