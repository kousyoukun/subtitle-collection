(呼出)
(exhales)

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,249
好的，宝贝，第一个候选人马上就到。
Okay, babe, first candidate   should be here any minute.

3
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:10,325
咖啡好了吗?
Is the coffee ready?

4
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,993
茶壶已经充好电了。
The tea kettle is charged.

5
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:13,661
英式早餐，花草茶，
English breakfast, herbal tea,

00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:17,499
绿茶，无咖啡因的，还有普通的。
green tea, decaf,   and (clicks tongue) regular.

7
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,259
你确定这些椒盐卷饼棒是素食的吗?
Hey, are we sure these pretzel sticks are vegan?

8
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,169
我想是的。候选人中有素食主义者吗?
I think so. Is one of the candidates vegan?

9
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:23,022
既然是女祭司，我只能假设。
Well, with the priestess,    I have to assume.

10
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,599
我不想冒犯她，你知道的。
I don't wanna      offend her, you know.

11
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,601
我担心你给我的压力太大了。
I'm worried you're putting    too much pressure on this.

12
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,935
嗯…
Uh...

13
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,011
不，我不是。
No, I am not.

14
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:33,866
这位司仪会让我们在上帝面前团结起来
This officiant is gonna     unite us in front of God

15
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,867
我们的余生。
for the rest of our lives.

16
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,684
我是说，这是件大事。
I mean, it is a big deal.

17
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:39,371
好吧。对，但对的人会找到我们的。
Okay.    Yeah, but the right person    will find us.

18
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,689
你只要做你自己，别担心。
You just have to be yourself   and not worry.

19
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,024
如果她不想要椒盐卷饼棒，
And if she doesn't      want a pretzel stick,

20
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:44,293
她不会吃的。
she won't eat it.

21
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,453
因为你认为他们不是素食主义者。
Because you think        they're not vegan.

22
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,363
我就知道。这是个愚蠢的想法。
I knew it.       It's a stupid idea.

23
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:49,697
我要把这些扔了。
I'm gonna throw these out.

24
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:50,624
嘿。
Hey.

25
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,200
-看着我。——(TK叹了口气)
-Look at me.            -(TK sighs)

26
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,702
这应该很有趣，好吗?
This is supposed        to be fun, alright?

27
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,263
一切都会好起来的。
Everything will be okay.

28
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,390
好吧。
Okay.

29
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,374

芬克尔拉比，谢谢你能来。
Rabbi Finkel,      thank you for coming.

32
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:05,213
当然可以。
Of course.

33
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:07,624
我们该叫你萨瓦德牧师吗
So should we call you      Pastor Savard

34
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:08,475
还是妮可牧师?
or Pastor Nicole?

35
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:09,476
妮可很好。
Oh, Nicole's fine.

36
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:11,737
紫水晶，或者女神。
Amethyst, or goddess,      if you prefer.

37
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,147
很高兴见到你，紫水晶。
It's very nice      to meet you, Amethyst.

38
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:15,148
卡洛斯·雷耶斯:我们可以叫你汤姆吗?
CARLOS REYES:       Can we call you Tom?

39
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,742
汤姆牧师，如果你不介意的话。
Uh, Reverend Tom,        if you don't mind.

40
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:21,138
我上神学院七年不是为了做汤姆。
I didn't go to divinity school for seven years to be just Tom.

41
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,992
容我说一句，你们俩都有光芒四射的光环。
If I may say, you two     both have radiant auras.

42
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,902

那些是椒盐卷饼棒吗?
Are those pretzel sticks?

45
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,632
是的。
Yeah.

46
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,822
(处理)
(crunching)

47
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:43,084
你确定你愿意为，
Are-are you sure you're okay with officiating a wedding for,

48
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,085
你知道，像我们这样的人?
you know, folks like us?

49
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:46,663
谁说他是个年轻的犹太男孩
Who's to say     a nice young Jewish boy

50
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:51,259
找不到一个英俊的天主教徒?
couldn't find love with      a handsome Catholic?

51
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,611
我们是a面教会。
We're a Side A church.

52
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,930
这意味着我们相信所有爱的关系
That means that we believe     all loving relationships

53
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,765
在上帝的眼中是平等的。
are equal in the eyes of God.

54
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:58,892
真漂亮。
That's really beautiful.

55
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:01,345
我给你带来了几段经文
I brought you     a few scripture passages

56
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:04,331
我觉得你们应该读一下
on the subject that I think would be great for you to read.

57
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,350
卡洛斯:嗯。
CARLOS: Hmm.

58
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:11,130
你的是一种淡蓝色的鼠尾草。
Yours is a cool blue       of a sage.

59
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,857
你的是火红的，充满激情的红色。
Yours is a fiery,         passionate red.

60
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:15,359
当你们聚在一起，
And when you come together,

61
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:18,862
你们的夫妻光环变成了棱镜…
your couple aura    turns into a prismatic...

62
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:19,972
紫色?
Purple?

63
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,214
你也有视力吗?
Do you have the sight, too?

64
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:24,292
不，我只是熟悉色轮。
No, I'm just familiar      with the color wheel.

65
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:27,053
我对同性婚姻的建议是
The passage I recommend     for same-sex unions is

66
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:29,982
<i>“Ani L'Dodi V'Dodi Li。”< / i >
<i> "Ani L'Dodi V'Dodi Li."</i>

67
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,299
我是我心爱的——
I am my beloved's--

68
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,211
-我的爱人是我的。是的。
-And my beloved is mine.     -RABBI FINKEL: Yes.

69
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:36,471
我猜是希伯来学校遗留下来的东西。
I guess something stuck     from Hebrew school.

70
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:37,397
(笑)
(chuckles)

71
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,049
人们并不总是喜欢听到这些。
And people don't always     like to hear it.

72
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:41,160
但有时光有爱是不够的。
But sometimes love isn't enough.

73
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:44,145
婚姻是你所做过的最大的承诺。
Marriage is the greatest   commitment you'll ever make.

74
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,165
尤其是对你们这些男孩。
Especially for you boys.

75
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,725
你们将永远在一起。
You'll be joined together    for eternity.

76
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,151
在地狱里燃烧。
Burning in hell.

77
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:51,561
-哇。嗯。
-Wow.              -Hmm.

78
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:53,413
谢谢你的提醒，Tom。是的。
-TK STRAND: Thanks for      the heads up, Tom.      -Yep.

79
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:56,008
-我能提个建议吗?-是的。
-If I may offer        a piece of advice?        -Yeah.

80
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,492
不要听噪音。
Don't listen to the noise.

81
00:02:57,494 --> 00:03:00,012
相信我，会有很多噪音的。
And believe me,  there will be a lot of noise.

82
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,014
嗬，嗬，嗬。哈哈哈。
Ho, ho, ho. Ha, ha, ha.

83
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,165
他，他，他。我，我，我。
He, he, he. Me, me, me.

84
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,926
迪。迪。他，他，他。
Dee, dee.           He, he, he.

85
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:09,079
我，我，我。你，你，你。
Me, me, me.        Thee, thee, thee.

86
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:10,430
26号你有空吗?
You available on the 26th?

87
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:14,084
我不相信基督教日历。或时间。
I don't believe in     the Christian calendar.     Or time.

88
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:16,862
所以现在剩下要做的就是招收你们
So all that's left to do now   is to enroll you

89
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,938
在一些课程中。
in some classes.

90
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,348
有些课吗?当然是皈依。
-Some classes?     -To convert, of course.

91
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,517
妮可牧师:我不喜欢强迫任何人做任何事，
PASTOR NICOLE:  I don't like to force anything  on anyone,

92
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,262
但我总是要求我的夫妻们
but I always ask        my couples to have

93
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:28,098
现在是大而艰难的对话
the big, difficult         conversations now

94
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,208
在你结婚之前。
before you get married.

95
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,451
关于工作，财务，爱情。
About work, finances, romance.

96
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:34,529
相信我，我们有过很多艰难的对话。
Oh, trust me, we've had all of the difficult conversations.

97
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:35,772
那孩子呢?
And what about kids?

98
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,550
我们不会有孩子的。等不及要吃了。
-CARLOS:  We're not gonna have kids.  -TK: Can't wait to have them.

99
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:41,470
怎么啦？
What?

100
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,057
(主题音乐播放)
(theme music plays)

101
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,466
那么谁是你的主要竞争者?
CARLOS: So who's your leading contender?

102
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,427
说实话，紫水晶有我的票
I'll be honest,       Amethyst had my vote

103
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,272
直到她说我有蓝色光环
right up until the moment   she said I had a blue aura.

104
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,567
大家都知道它是翠绿色的。
Everybody knows       it's emerald green.

105
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:59,053
我们真的不谈这个吗，卡洛斯?
Are we seriously not gonna     talk about this, Carlos?

106
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,630
谈什么?
CARLOS:         Talk about what?

107
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:03,817
我们之间刚刚拉开的鸿沟?
The gaping chasm that just opened up between us?

108
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,802
没有巨大的鸿沟。
There's no gaping chasm.

109
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,305
卡洛斯，你什么时候不想要孩子了?
Carlos, since when do you    not wanna have kids?

110
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:10,398
我什么时候说过了?
Since when did I ever say I did?

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,476
我不知道，我只是假设。
I don't know,    I-I guess I just assumed.

112
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:14,811
你还以为我没有妻子。
You also assumed      I didn't have a wife.

113
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,070
你真有趣。
You're so funny.

114
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,422
我们怎么从来没谈过这个?
How have we never had       this conversation?

115
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,758
我不知道。我没想过这个问题。
I don't know. It's not something I've been thinking about.

116
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,076
而且我们一直在忙工作
Plus, we've been busy working,

117
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,095
想找点乐子
trying to have a little fun

118
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,172
当我们没有昏迷或被绑架的时候。
when we're not in comas     or being abducted.

119
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:28,267
是啊，但是你…你喜欢孩子，卡洛斯。
Yeah, but you...      you love kids, Carlos.

120
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,102
我喜欢别人家的孩子。
I love other people's kids.

121
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,330
好吧。你的侄子和侄女呢
Okay. What about     your nephews and nieces

122
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:36,166
或者维加上尉的双胞胎或者小查理?
or-or Captain Vega's twins    or baby Charlie?

123
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:38,018
别人家的孩子。
All other people's kids.

124
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,611
是啊，但你和他们相处得很好。
Yeah, but you're        so great with them.

125
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,854
谢谢你！
Thank you.

126
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:42,022
我对马也很在行。
I'm also great with horses.

127
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,323
还有一些你可能不知道的事情。
Something else    you probably didn't know.

128
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,860
TK，我只是想让我们有机会做回自己。
TK, I just want us    to have a chance to be us.

129
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,936
我还有很多事想和你一起做。
There are so many things    I still wanna do with you.

130
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,271
我想和你一起去爬长城。
I wanna hike     the Great Wall with you.

131
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,682
我想在托斯卡纳和你睡个懒觉。我想,
I wanna sleep in       in Tuscany with you.       I wanna--

132
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,460
宝贝，你都没来过这里，而且你讨厌睡懒觉。
Babe, you don't even hike here, and you hate sleeping in.

133
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,354
是的。我们还是没一起去过纽约。
Yeah. We've still never been   to New York together.

134
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,705
你知道他们允许你这么做的
Well, you know       that they allow you

135
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:00,023
带孩子来纽约吗
to bring children         into New York?

136
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,192
我只是觉得我们离准备好还差得远
I just don't think we're  anywhere close to being ready

137
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,044
对于那种程度的责任。
for that level        of responsibility.

138
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:06,029
我们甚至从来没有养过宠物。
We've never even had a pet.

139
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,864
卢。
Lou.

140
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:08,974
卢?tk:卢。
-Lou?            -TK: Lou.

141
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,200

那只蜥蜴五分钟后就逃走了

143
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,053
在你把它带回家之后
after you brought it       to the house

144
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,371
我们把它放回大自然了吗?
and that we've released     back into the wild?

145
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,964
所以你觉得我会是个糟糕的父亲。
So you think I'm gonna     make a terrible father.

146
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,224
我从没这么说过。
I never said that.

147
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:19,609
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

148
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,197
但我认为…
But what I do think...

149
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:32,998
你会成为一个出色的丈夫。

为了回答你的问题，
And to answer your question,

是的，点心是免费的。
yes, the pastries        are complimentary.

155
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,928
(咯咯地笑)哦，这太豪华了，米奇。
(chuckles)  Oh, it's awfully fancy, Mitch.

156
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,023
我是说，我们需要这么高级的东西吗?
I mean, do we need        something so fancy?

157
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,599
在我们经历了那么多之后?
After what we've been through?

158
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,342
这是宇宙欠我们的。
The universe owes it to us.

159
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,864
天灾毁坏了我们的婚房，我们就无家可归了。
We were unhoused   when an act of God   destroyed our marital abode.

160
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,181
哦,不。火吗?
Oh, no. Fire?

161
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:08,867
实际上是消防队。
Fire department, actually.

162
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,868
我们失去了一切。
We lost everything.

163
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,186
幸运的是，我叔叔最近去世了。
Luckily, my uncle        passed recently.

164

把他的复式公寓留给了我们。

165
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:15,523

悲剧发生后，我们启动了GoFundMe网站

169
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,367
看看人们对有需要的人有多慷慨。
to see how generous people can be to those in need.

170
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,128
它恢复了我们对人性的信心。
It restored      our faith in humanity.

171
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,037
现在我们冲水。
(singsongy)          Now we flush.

172
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,781
(呵呵)

173
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,600
那么，你说呢?
So, what do you say?

-我们再来点这个。我明白了。
-Let's get, uh, more of these.  -I gotcha.

177
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,738
我是说，人们捐了那笔钱
I mean, people        donated that money

178
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,815
这样我们就能买得起新房子了，
so we could afford a new home,

179
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:49,983
但我们现在有了。
but we have that now.

180
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:51,134
我们不应该还回去吗?
Shouldn't we give it back?

181
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,394
莱拉，当人们为有价值的事业捐款时，
Lila, when people donate     to a worthy cause,

182
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,229
他们这样做是为了让自己感觉良好。
they do it so they feel good.

183
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,791
你想让他们远离这种感觉吗?
Do you wanna take that feeling  away from them?

184
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,252
嗯，没有，但是…
Well, no, but it just...

185
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,088
感觉好奢侈。
feels so extravagant.

186
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,257
看，这就是所谓的贫穷心态，
See, that's what you call    a poverty mindset,

187
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,074
你必须克服这一点。
and you have to get over that.

188
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:08,334
我知道当你照镜子时，
I know when you look       in the mirror,

189
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:11,263
你看到一个来自拖车公园的新手。
you see a plebe      from the trailer park.

190
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,223
但你知道我看到了什么吗?
But you know what I see?

191
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:15,100
怎么啦？
What?

192
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,326
一个女王。
A queen.

193
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:18,603

卡住了，卡住了，动弹不得?
So stuck like,     stuck, stuck can't move?

如果我们能移动，你觉得我们还会坐在这里吗?
Well, do you think     we'd be sitting in here        if we could move?

265
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,666
我不太了解你，不能回答这个问题。
I don't know you well enough   to answer that question.

266

维加上尉，你要评估一下医疗伤害吗?

-(Lila groaning)        -What? What "hmm"?

287
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,062
你为什么只是站在那里?
Why are you       just standing there?

288
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,063
我评估。
I'm assessing.

289
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,806
要评估什么?
What is there to assess?

290
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:00,049
带我们离开这里!
Get us out of here!

291
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:01,159
欧文:我们不急。
OWEN:       We don't wanna rush.

292
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,218
对吧，马尔瓦尼?
Isn't that right, Marwani?

293
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,978
对了，队长。
Oh, that's right, Cap.

294
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,996
可能会有错误。
There could be mistakes.

295
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:05,997
错误是不好的。
Mistakes are bad.

296
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,333
我的天啊。把我们拉出去。
Oh, my God.        Just pull us out.

297
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,592
欧文:我们可以把你拉出来。
OWEN:   We could just pull you out.

298
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,652
对吧，贾德?我们可以把他们拉出来。
Isn't that right, Judd?     We could pull 'em out.

299
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,229
我是说，我们可以把他们拉出来
Well, I mean,      we could pull 'em out,

300
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:14,822
但我们可能会直接把他们的胳膊扯下来。
but we'd probably just    pull their arms right off.

301
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:15,656
-什么?是的。
-What?        -JUDD RYDER: Yeah.

302
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:16,657
牛粪有重量
Cow manure weighs somewhere

303
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:19,678
在每立方码1200到1800磅之间，
between 1,200 and 1,800     pounds per cubic yard,

304
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,755
这取决于牛的饮食中有多少纤维。
depending on how much, uh,    fiber's in the cows' diet.

305
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,498
我觉得这个有很多。
I think this one had a lot.

306
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,185
好了，我们拿些铲子进来。
Alright, let's get      some shovels in here.

307
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,929
-是的，是的，铲子。谢谢你！-是的，是的，是的。
-Yes, Yes, shovels. Thank you.  -Yes, yes, yes.

308
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:31,414
这要花多长时间?
MITCH:  H-How long is this gonna take?

309
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,100
哦，不久。一两个小时。
Oh, not long.          Hour or two.

310
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:37,862
不，我还得再呼吸一个小时。
No, I cannot breathe in this   for another hour.

311
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,346
欧文:嗯，我想我们可以适合你
OWEN:         Well, I suppose         we could fit you

312
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:41,182
带着全脸防微粒呼吸器。
with a full-face       particle respirator.

313
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:42,258
莱拉:是的。气体的面具。
-LILA: Yes.           -Gas mask.

314
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,351
是的。是的，那个，谢谢。
Yes. Yes, that, please.

315
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:45,611
但如果我们要按规矩来，
But if we're gonna        go by the book,

316
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:48,355
这些都是出于医疗原因才使用的。
those are only deployed      for medical reasons.

317
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,783
上尉，你能看出什么医疗原因吗?
Captain, can you see       any medical reasons?

318
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:53,436
嗯…不，一个都没有。毫米。
Uh... no, not a one. Mm.

319
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,456
这样的话，就由我来决定了
Well, in that case, it falls to the sole discretion

320
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,157
负责设备的消防员。
of the firefighter     in charge of equipment.

321
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,260
(嘲笑)那是谁?
(scoffs) And who's that?

322
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,128
(Lila低声呻吟)
(Lila whimpers)

323
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,796
-哦。(呻吟)哦，不。
-Oh. (groans)          -Oh, no.

324
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:05,131
欧文:怎么样，Marwani?
OWEN:    What do you say, Marwani?

325
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,950
-我们应该让他们休息一下吗?(呼出)
-Should we give 'em a break?   -(exhales)

326
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:08,284
这要看情况。
Now, that depends.

327
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:10,878
我们保证不管发生什么，我们都不会起诉。
We promise whatever happens,   we won't sue.

328
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,305
这很好。
That's good.

329
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:14,232
但我还需要一件事。
But I am gonna need       one more thing.

330
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,569
任何东西。救我们出去。
Anything. Just get us out.

331
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:20,071

Yeah, you're showing off     a little bit for me.

358
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,979
好吧，那就给我纽约。
Alright, well, then         give me New York.

359
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,372
<我>容易。这是纽约</i>
<i> Easy. It's New York.</i>

360
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,316
(模仿蜂鸣器的嗡嗡声)不。
(imitates buzzer buzzing)    No.

361
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,226
不，这是个陷阱问题。
No, that's a trick question.

362
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:41,394
我知道感觉就像在纽约
I know it feels like New York

363
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:43,379
应该是纽约的首府
should be     the capital of New York,

364
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:44,305
但事实并非如此。
but it is not.

365

(叹气)<i>什么时候我们</i> <i>需要</i>

<i>什么时候?< / i >
IZZY:<i> Like when?</i>

369
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:53,814

370
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,058
笑吧。
-(laughs)          -TOMMY: Laugh.

371
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,225
当你错过的时候
When you miss out

372
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,227
一套全新的洗衣机和烘干机，
on a brand-new set      of washer and dryers,

373
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:01,989
就因为你不知道纽约的首府在哪里…
well, just because you didn't know the capital of New York...

374
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,399
<我>奥尔巴尼。< / i >
<i> Albany.</i>

375
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,917
你在耍我吗?
Were you messin' with me?

376
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,161
你这是在耍妈妈吗?
Were you playing a trick     on mom right now?

377
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:08,847
<i>别担心，</i> <i>我们能行，好吗?< / i >
IZZY:        <i> Don't worry,</i>       <i> we got this, okay?</i>

378
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:09,830
IZZY和EVIE:我们得走了
IZZY AND EVIE:          <i> We gotta go.</i>

379
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:10,756
我对你的爱像月亮一样深。
I love you to the moon.

380
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:11,683
(吻)
(kisses)

381
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,353
-我去过奥尔巴尼，相信我，
-(Tommy chuckles)      -I've been to Albany,      and trust me,

382
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,080
首都真的应该是纽约。
the capital really        should be New York.

383
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,672
对吧?这就是我要说的。
Right?     This is what I'm saying.

384
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:19,673
他们真的需要解决这个问题。
They really need to fix that.

385
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,860
我喜欢现在女孩们捉弄你的样子。
I love how the girls        mess with you now.

386
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,936
(笑)这是最好的。只是…
(laughs)      It's the best. Just...

387
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:27,773
我不知道，看着他们变成真人。
I don't know, watching them    turn into actual people.

388
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:28,992
TK:是的。
TK: Yeah.

389
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:33,538
警监，我能问你个问题吗?
Cap, can I ask you a question?

390
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,355
确定。
Sure.

391
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,690
你一直都想为人父母吗?
Did you always        wanna be a parent?

392
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:40,103
从我第一个卷心菜娃娃开始。
Since my first       Cabbage Patch doll.

393
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,287
(咯咯地笑)太好了。
(chuckling) Love that.

394
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,623
所以这只是时间问题，而不是如果?
So it was a matter        of when not if?

395
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,790
不完全是。
Not exactly.

396
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:47,201
好像想要孩子是一回事，
It's like wanting to have kids  is one thing,

397
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,462
但是…能够拥有它们，
but... being able to have 'em,

398
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:51,723
那完全是另一回事。
that turned out to be    a whole other ball of wax.

399
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,308
不容易吗?
It wasn't easy?

400
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,635
我的生命之战。
Fight of my life.

401
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:56,561
真的吗?
Really?

402
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:59,230
我们认为这些都是理所当然的
Well, we take for granted    those things

403
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,125
我们认为这很容易，
that-that we think         will come easily,

404
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:03,476
然后当他们不这样做的时候
and-and then when they don't,

405
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:06,070
这是世界上最难的事情。
it's, it's the hardest thing   in the world.

406
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:08,555
你是怎么处理的?
How'd you handle it?

407
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,326
不是好。一开始是，呃…
Not well.  In the beginning it was, uh...

408
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:13,912
我是说，我很生气。
I mean, I was angry.

409
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,399
我又生气又沮丧，累死了。
I was angry and depressed    and bone-tired.

410
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:21,502
和…说实话，准备退出。
And... truth be told,      ready to quit.

411
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:23,630
为什么不呢?
Why didn't you?

412
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,314
查尔斯。
Charles.

413
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,836
是的。他让我相信所有这些心痛和挣扎
Yeah. He-he convinced me that all this heartache and struggle

414
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:31,821
这是值得的。
was gonna be worth it.

415
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,598
这样我就能重回拳台了
So I'd get back in the ring

416
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,008
然后从头再来一遍。
and start slugging it out    all over again.

417
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,560
他说得对吗?
Well, was he right?

418
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:39,845
这值得吗?
Was it worth the fight?

419
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:41,439
你怎么看?
What do you think?

420
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,852
来吧，来吧。伸展右腿。
JOE:      Come on, come on.      Extend that right leg.

421
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:49,155
好吧，来吧，Marj，现在你懂了。推动。推，推，推。
PAUL: Alright, come on,     Marj, now you got this.     Push. Push, push, push.

422
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,931
好吧?推，推，推。
All right? Push, push, push.

423
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:51,857
你能停下来吗?
Will you stop?

424
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:53,952
我在做理疗，又没生孩子。
I'm doing PT,      I'm not giving birth.

425
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,194
乔:呃，不过他说得对。
JOE:     Uh, he's right, though.

426
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:56,862
你的那条腿需要进一步伸展。
You need to get   more extension in that leg.

427
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:58,105
这是唯一能让你得到
That's the only way         you're gonna get

428
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,348
所有的力量都在你的臀屈肌。
all the strength        in your hip flexor.

429
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,441
保罗:嗯。我尝试。
-PAUL: Mm-hmm.           -I'm trying.

430
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,776
哦，得了吧。就像我兄弟尤达说的。
Oh, come on.   It's like my man Yoda says.

431
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,963
“没有尝试，只有行动。”
"Ain't no try, only do."

432
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,281
是啊，尤达从没中过枪。
Yeah, well, Yoda never       got shot in the gut.

433
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,718
我需要再延长20%的时间。
I need 20% more extension.

434
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,620
(呼气)
(exhaling)

435
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,865
好吧，对，对，对。是的，你说对了，Marj。
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.     Yeah, you got it, Marj.

436
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,642
你说对了!来吧!
You got it! Come on!

437
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,726
不错的工作。释放。
Nice job. Release.

438
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,146
-(叹气)-不错，消防员。
-(sighs)      -Not bad, firefighter.

439
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,465
(清嗓子)还不错吧?
(clears throat)         Not bad?

440
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,299
乔:嗯。
JOE: Mm-hmm.

441
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,210
我只是给了你完整的延期。
I just gave you full extension.

442
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,470
是的，你说了。我很庆幸我没有眨眼。
Yeah, you did.     I'm glad I didn't blink.

443
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:32,565
也许下次你可以拿得更久一点…两秒?
Maybe next time you can hold it for longer than... two seconds?

444
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:36,569
你真的是在吸取我的痛苦，对吧?
You really do just  feed off my misery, don't you?

445
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:37,887
我做的事。
I do.

446
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,055
而且很好吃。
And it is delicious.

447
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:41,390
(呵呵)
(both chuckling)

448
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,559
哦。我的1:15刚刚出现。
Ooh. My 1:15 just showed.

449
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,294
下周见。

再见。
See ya.

451

和平。
Peace.

452
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:55,013
怎么啦？
What?

453
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,073
你真的要装作什么都没发生过吗?
Oh, you really gonna act like  that didn't just happen?

454
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,499
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know    what you're talking about.

455
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:01,001
我说的是你和教练乔
I'm talking about you      and trainer Joe

456
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,169
在那边跟人调情。
flirting it up       a storm over there.

457
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,688
(嘲笑)我们不是在调情。
(scoffs) We were not flirting.

458
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,025
嗯。好吧，不管那是什么，反正是开着的。
Hmm. Okay, well, whatever that was, it was on and poppin'.

459
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,026
-(手机铃声)-闭嘴。
-(cell phone chimes)       -Shut up.

460
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,318

是什么?
What is it?

468
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:34,552
萨利姆和他的牙周病医生刚生了个孩子。

471
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,230
我是说，对于一个婴儿来说。
I mean, for a baby, I mean.

472

TK: Yeah,    its head is kinda pointy.

谢谢,伙计们。你是最棒的。
Thanks, guys.         You're the best.

475

-Ugly baby.         -Is it, though?

-MARJAN: No.           -No.

478
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,317
首先，你不能再跟踪萨利姆了
First of all, you need     to stop following Salim

479
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,635
在社交上，马上。

00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:02,062
其次，你别再闷闷不乐了。
And second of all,     you need to stop moping.

481
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,322
我的灵魂被击中了。
I just got punched        in the soul.

482
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:05,232
别以为这是对灵魂的重击。
Well, don't think of it     as a punch in the soul.

483
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,250
就当是狠狠踢了你一脚。
Think of it      as a kick in the ass.

484
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,993
这有什么用呢?
And how's that    supposed to help exactly?

485
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,570
也许这就是宇宙的规律
Well, maybe this is        the universe's way

486
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,071
告诉你是时候回去了
of telling you that it's time  to get back out there

487
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,315
开始寻找真命天子
and start looking        for Mr. Right

488
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:14,592
而不是盯着自己的另一半。
instead of staring  in the rear-view at Mr. Wrong.

489
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,002
他说得对，Marj。-我不知道。
-TK:   He's got a good point, Marj.   -I don't know.

490
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:19,079
我还没准备好开始约会。
Look, I-I'm not ready      to start dating.

491
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,490
你和萨利姆两年前分手了。
You and Salim     broke up two years ago.

492
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:22,934
你的生命中应该有一些火花。
You deserve a few sparks     in your life.

493
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,161
我就是靠擦火花为生的。
I literally put sparks out    for a living.

494
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:28,347
你知道吗?即使我真的想开始约会，
You know what? Even if    I did wanna start dating,

495
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:31,016
这对我来说是一件大事。
it's a-a whole thing for me.

496
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:33,760
一件我从未做过的事。
A thing that I've actually    never done before.

497
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:36,614
那家伙必须是穆斯林。我希望有个监护人。
The guy has to be Muslim. I'd want there to be a chaperon.

498
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,765
——只是……-你是说像保姆那样?
-There's just...   -You mean like a babysitter?

499
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,267
我是说，这是规定吗?
I mean, is that like,      a rule or something?

500
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,195
因为我哥们阿米尔总是一个人跟姑娘约会。
'Cause my buddy Amir goes out  with chicks solo all the time.

501
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,848
不过他确实需要个保姆。
Though he could    actually use a babysitter.

502
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,108
(嘴巴)真的。那么我们在这里谈论什么呢?
-(mouths) True.       -TK: So what are we       talking about here,

503
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,368
像专业的监护人?
like a professional chaperon?

504
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,130
不，像我父亲，叔叔，表弟。
No, like my father,       uncle, cousin.

505
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,114
所以家庭。确实不错。
-So family.            -Exactly.

506
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,616
我的都在迈阿密。
And mine are all in Miami.

507
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:58,285
所以就算我准备好了，
So even if I was ready     to put myself out there,

508
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,137
我在这里没有家人。
I don't have any family here.

509
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,139
这是个不错的尝试，Marjan。
That's a nice try, Marjan.

510
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,199
你有一屋子的家人呢。
You got a houseful      of family right here.

511
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,958
当一个人是对的，他就是对的。
When the man's right,      he is right.

512
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,959
保罗:他说得对。
PAUL:         And he's right.

513
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,294
所以不要找借口，Marjan。
So no excuses, Marjan.

514
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,730
你想要个监护人，你有很多。
You want a chaperon,       you got plenty.

515
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:11,298
好啊!
Fine!

516
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,558
我会回到阿森特的
I'll get back on Ascent

517
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,225

00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:14,576
-走吧，Marj。南希:哇!
-Let's go, Marj.         -NANCY: Whoo!

519
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,729
让它开始吧!-这是个开始。
-PAUL: Gettin' it goin'!     -It's a start.

520
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:18,381
-好的吗?-你是说开始?
-Okay?     -What you mean a start?

521
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:20,216
一个约会软件是解决不了问题的。
Well, one dating app        ain't gonna cut it.

522
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:21,217
数到三。
You gotta be on three.

523
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,476
保罗:嗯。——至少。
-PAUL: Hmm.           -At least.

524
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:25,388
我是说，更多的泳池，更多的鱼。
I mean, you know,      more pools, more fish.

525
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,147
为什么我已经开始后悔了?
Why am I already         regretting this?

526
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,408
你会有起起伏伏。
You're gonna have ups   and you're gonna have downs.

527
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,652
永远不要太高，也不要太低。
Never get too high      and never get too low.

528
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:34,988
找到你的王子通常意味着要亲吻很多青蛙。
Finding your prince usually  means kissing a lot of frogs.

529
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,582
你必须一开始就接受
You have to accept        out of the gate

530
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:37,491
无论你做什么，
that no matter what you do,

531
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:39,235
其中一些日期将是畏缩的。
some of these dates       will be cringe.

532
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:40,178
太好了。
Great.

533
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,828
好吧，我们需要一个安全词。
Okay, we're gonna        need a safety word.

534
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,663
安全词?
A safety word?

535
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:43,497
哦,不。他说得对。
Oh, no. He is right.

536
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:44,831
外面太残酷了，Marjan。
It's brutal out there, Marjan.

537
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,999
所以监护人需要
So the chaperons          are gonna need

is usually the last guy     you'd expect.

558
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,958
这就是为什么你至少要插入一个安慰书呆子
That's why you gotta insert    at least one comfort nerd

559
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,901
加入阵容，Marj。
into the lineup, Marj.

560
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,477
-安慰书呆子?tk:是的。
-A comfort nerd?         -TK: Yeah.

561
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:41,239
你知道的，就是一个冷静的人，可以帮你减轻压力
You know, someone who's chill and will help take the ease off

562
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,315
到了约会的时候。
when it's time for,        you know, date day.

563
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:45,392
噢,是吗?那家伙长什么样?
Oh, yeah?  What does that guy look like?

564
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,245
这些是给你的。(笑)
These are for you. (chuckles)

565
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,822
哇!谢谢。
Wow! Thanks.

566
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:51,231
他们是美丽的。-哇。
-They're beautiful.       -Wow.

567
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,584
他们是美丽的。-它们是纸吗?
-They're gorgeous.         -Are they paper?

568
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,753
我真的很喜欢纸做的花。
I'm really into paper-based   floral arrangements.

569
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,239
比以氨为基础的肥料更可持续。(笑)
Way more sustainable than ammonia-based fertilizers. (chuckles)

570
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,333
环保，体贴。
Eco-friendly and thoughtful.

571
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,319
好吧，那个词是什么来着?
Okay, well, what's the word?

572
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:05,579
我一直很喜欢“芜菁甘蓝”这个词。
I've always liked       the word "rutabaga."

573
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,748
(咯咯地笑)要做到这一点有点棘手
(chuckles) It's gonna be   a little tricky to work that

574
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,657
来个谈话，队长。
into a conversation, Cap.

575
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:09,492
也许对你来说。
Maybe for you.

576
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,010
呃，好吧，那
MARJAN:      Uh, okay, how about--

577
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:12,995
“爆米花”怎么样?
how about, um, "popcorn"?

578
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:14,997
好吧，我想这也行。
Okay, I guess that works, too.

579
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,165
好吧。
Okay.

580
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,683
哈桑，如果你能描述一下
Hassan, if you were to describe

581
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:20,111
用一个词概括你的职业，是什么?
your occupation in one word,   what would it be?

582
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,537
企业家。——啊。
-Entrepreneur.          -Ah.

583
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,857
杰克·贝佐斯，你最好小心点，因为我要来了。
Jake Bezos, you better look out, 'cause I'm coming.

584
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,509
-走吧，宝贝!-耶!
-Let's go, baby!         -Yeah!

585
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,360
如果我告诉你有个健身房呢
What if I told you       that there was a gym

586
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:30,362
健身器械旁边的位置
where next to      every workout machine

587
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:31,514
有一个自拍站
there was a selfie station

588
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:33,198
也不需要穿衬衫。
and no shirts       were ever required.

589
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,126
生病的!哈桑:对吧?
-Sick!         -HASSAN: Right?

590
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,277
你得把这个概念藏起来，兄弟。
You gotta keep that concept   under your hat, bro.

591
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,945
我仍然在寻求风险投资。
I'm still out to VCs.

592
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:40,689
就像我的<i> teta</i>，
It's like my<i> teta</i>        used to say,

593
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:42,691
“花开花落，都太快了。”
"Flowers bloom,   but are all gone too soon."

594
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:44,193
除了这些。(笑)
Except these. (laughs)

595
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,044
你的<我> teta吗?< / i >
Your<i> teta?</i>

596
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,211
它的意思是奶奶。
It means grandma.

597
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:47,954
是的，我知道。我是黎巴嫩。
Yeah, I know. I'm Lebanese.

598
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:49,365
-不。好的，没问题。
-No way.        -MARJAN: Yes way.

599
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:50,808
(Zain和Marjan笑)什么?
-(Zain and Marjan laugh)     -ZAIN: What?

600
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,204
你的资料里说你是一名税务律师。
So, uh, it says in your profile you're a tax attorney.

601
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,963
-是吗?-我就是干这个的。
-Is that right?         -It's what I do.

602
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,649
但我不是这样的人。
But it's not who I am.

603
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,392
这不是我的激情所在。
It's, it's not my passion.

604
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:02,378
哦。那么，你的激情是什么?
Oh. Well, what is your passion?

605
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,471
我在国际狗狗救援空间工作。
I work in the International Dog Rescue Space.

606
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:05,214
哇。
Wow.

607
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:06,157
这有点傻，
It's kinda dorky,

608
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,566
但是，我非常喜欢
but, uh, I love pretty much

609
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:08,901
哈利·波特。
anything Harry Potter.

610
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:11,495
说实话，我对世间的激情都持怀疑态度。
I'm suspicious of all   earthly passions, honestly.

611
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,390
现在，我痴迷于我的三角。
Right now, I'm obsessed     with my delts.

612
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,168
我众包资金安排航班
I crowdsource financing     to arrange flights

613
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,693
让狗远离街道
for dogs to get off the streets

614
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:21,397
在世界各地的国家和爱的家庭。
in countries all over the world and into loving homes.

615
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:25,158
我们把狗从伊朗空运到加拿大，
Uh, we fly dogs       from Iran to Canada,

616
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,345
哥斯达黎加，美国。
Costa Rica, the US.

617
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,162
需求是无穷无尽的。
The needs are, are endless.

618
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,681
这是难以置信的。
That's incredible.

619
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,682
我知道这听起来很傻
I know it sounds silly,

620
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,926
但我把他们当成我的孩子
but I think of them as my kids.

621
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:36,245
哦，不，这听起来一点都不傻。
Oh, no, that doesn't sound silly at all.

622
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:39,857
说到这个，你对孩子有什么看法?
And speaking of,   how do you feel about kids?

623
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,058
比如，有多少?
Like, how many?

624
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,768
八。八?
-Eight.             -Eight?

625
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,344
是的。除非你想要更多。
Yeah. Unless you want more.

626
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,088
你已经不年轻了，
Well, you're no longer      a spring chicken,

627
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,257
我们得抓紧时间，但是，
we'd have to hurry, but, um,

628
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,943
你的身材很强壮，所以…
your build is strong, so...

629
00:22:50,945 --> 00:22:52,595
你觉得他们有卖爆米花吗?
Do you think       they serve popcorn?

630
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:54,263
哦，看看这里的时间有点……
Oh, look at the time     in here is somethin'...

631
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,207
爆米花。很晚了。
-Popcorn.        -PAUL: It's late.

632
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,267
那么，你对我有什么感觉
So, uh, how would        you feel about me

633
00:22:58,269 --> 00:22:59,935
有了孩子后还要工作?
working after having children?

634
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:01,027
没关系。
Fine with it.

635
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,028
只要他们支持曼联。
As long as they root       for Man United.

636
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,938
从来没有!
Never!

637
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,956
阿森纳或者什么都没有。
Arsenal or nothing.

638
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,458
我很乐意做个家庭主父。
I'd be happy to be        a stay-at-home dad.

639
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,443
去吧，宝贝。
Do you, baby.

640
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:08,944
总得有人资助哈桑之梦。
Somebody's gotta fund      the Hassan Dream.

641
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:09,962
给人生目标加上标签。
Hashtag life goals.

642
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:13,039
我真的很想吃爆米花。
You know, I'd really        love some popcorn.

643
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,950
(嘲笑)在茶馆?
(scoffs)         In a tea house?

644
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:15,951
是的。
Yeah.

645
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,544
你为什么不去看看，宝贝?
Why don't you go check, baby?

646
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:18,729
呃,好吧。
Uh, okay.

647
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,047
这是多萝西。
This is Dorothy.

648
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,567
她在德黑兰的街道上失去了两只耳朵。
She lost her ears    on the streets of Tehran.

649
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,460
哦。
Aw.

650
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:26,812
她咬掉了玩具的耳朵
She chewed the ears off her toy

651
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:27,813
这样它们就匹配了。
so that they match.

652
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,314
这不是很神奇吗?
Isn't that amazing?

653
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:31,575
这是我见过的最美的东西。
Oh, that is the       most beautiful thing       I have ever seen.

654
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,662
在我为她找到一个永远的家之前，我不能休息。
I can't rest until    I find her a forever home.

655
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:36,455
是的。
Yeah.

656
00:23:36,824 --> 00:23:38,064
你的房子是什么?
So what's your house?

657
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:39,566
我们有126个。
Oh, we work out of the 126.

658
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,161
tk:嗯。-不，我是说你的霍格沃茨房子。
-TK: Mm-hmm.       -No, I mean       your Hogwarts house.

659
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:44,905
就像我是拉文克劳。我打赌你也是。
Like I'm Ravenclaw.        I bet you are, too.

660
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:45,814
或斯莱特林。
Or Slytherin.

661
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:48,259
我的天啊。别告诉我你是赫奇帕奇的。
Oh, my God. Please don't   tell me you're a Hufflepuff.

662
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,262
我不是很喜欢哈利波特。
I'm not really into  the whole Harry Potter thing.

663
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,004
我不…
I don't...

664
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,582
你知道吗?我觉得这行不通。
You know what?       I don't think       this is gonna work.

665
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:56,475
嗯。
Huh.

666
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:00,329
嗯，那是一种经历。
Well, that was an experience.

667
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:02,106
我总是全力以赴。
I always go full throttle.

668
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,183
记得在Instagram上关注我。
Hey, make sure    to follow me on Instagram.

669
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:06,259
我一直在努力提升自己的形象。
I've been trying      to boost that profile.

670
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:07,761
非常感谢。
Would appreciate it.

671
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:08,929
发短信给我，兄弟。
Text me, bro.

672
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,931
我的男人。我喜欢那个傻乎乎的孩子。
My man.      I like the goofy kid.

673
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:11,991
嗯。
Hmm.

674
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:15,360
Marjan。队长链。
Marjan. Captain Strand.

675
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:18,122
-这是我的荣幸。同样。
-This has been such a pleasure. -Likewise.

676
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,199
但我该走了。
But I should        probably be going.

677
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,275
多萝西开始撕家具
Dorothy starts     tearing up the furniture

678
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:23,961
如果我晚饭时间迟到了
if I'm, uh,      late for dinner time.

679
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,946
所以，我们应该再做一次。
So, we should do this again.

680
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:27,047
我很乐意。
I'd love that.

681
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,387
再见。-MARJAN:再见。
-Bye.          -MARJAN: Bye.

682
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,351
(Marjan咯咯地笑)
(Marjan giggles)

683
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:43,147
-我想我们找到赢家了!——(欧文笑)
-I think we just found a winner! -(Owen chuckles)

684
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,723
我想我们找到了一个天使。
I think we just found an angel.

685
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:46,709
是的。(笑)
Yeah. (chuckles)

686
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:47,610
哦。(叹息)
Oh. (sighs)

687
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:55,067
哦，伙计，你看，任何人都可以
Oh, man, look,        literally anybody

688
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,160
可以被任命为牧师为你们主持婚礼。
can get ordained        to marry you guys.

689
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,143
-是吗?保罗:嗯。
-Yeah?          -PAUL: Mm-hmm.

690
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:57,995
TK:那意味着什么?
TK:     And what's that entail?

691
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:58,979
很简单，伙计。
PAUL:         It's easy, man.

692
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:00,331
我在网上做的。
I did it online.

693
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,000
怎么了，Marj?
What's up, Marj?

694
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:03,892
嘿，你有满格吗?
MARJAN: Hey, are you getting full bars?

695
00:25:03,894 --> 00:25:04,893
因为我不认为我
'Cause I don't think I'm--

696
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:06,078
我觉得我没有得到完整的格数。
I don't think      I'm getting full bars.

697
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,654
-是的。是啊，我也是。
-Yeah.       -TK: Yeah, me, too.

698
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,007
-MARJAN:哦……-等等，保罗，你被任命了?
-MARJAN: Oh...  -Wait, Paul, you're ordained?

699
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,400
是的，我和我在芝加哥的表妹结婚了
PAUL:       Yeah, I married       my cousin in Chicago

700
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:13,159
-几年前。嗯。
-a couple of years back.     -Huh.

701
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:14,512
马特奥:怎么了?什么了?
MATEO:        What up? What up?

702
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,072
嘿，嘿。-怎么样，家人?
-PAUL: Hey, yo.      -How we doin', family?

703
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:18,257
有什么事吗?我们做得很好。
What's up? We doin' good.

704
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,166
除了Marj，她没有酒吧。
Except for Marj,         who has no bars.

705
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:22,745
事实上，我有酒吧，所以，是的。
Actually, I do       have bars, so, yeah.

706
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:24,246
姑娘，怎么了?
Girl, what is wrong?

707
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:25,856
是那个叫福扎的家伙。
It's that Fauza guy.

708
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,082
那是救狗的人吗
Is that the dog rescue guy

709
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:28,859
还是那个长得像奥马尔·谢里夫的年轻人?
or the young     Omar Sharif-looking guy?

710
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,694
-是同一个人。(南希笑)
-It's the same guy.         -(Nancy chuckles)

711
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,920
我们真的很合得来。
We really hit it off.

712
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,090
你知道吗，约会最后他说，
You know, the date literally ended with him saying,

713
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:37,017
"我们应该再来一次"现在什么都没了。
"We should do this again,"    and now nothing.

714
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,094
一个电话也没有，一条短信也没有。
Not a call or a single text.

715
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:39,945
南希:嗯。
NANCY: Hmm.

716
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,430
他的原话是什么?
What were his exact words?

717
00:25:41,432 --> 00:25:44,375
再来一次还是改天再来一次?
Do this again    or do this again sometime?

718
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,435
我不知道。有区别吗?
I don't know.    Does it make a difference?

719
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:48,120
-当然。-这有很大不同，Marj。
-PAUL: Hell, yeah.     -Oh, it makes     a big difference, Marj.

720
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:49,213
那个“有时”限定词
That "sometime" qualifier

721
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,197
从具体到模糊。
takes it from the concrete    to the vague.

722
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,775
是的。细微差别很重要。
Yup. Nuance matters.

723
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:55,294
没人告诉我要记笔记。
Well, nobody told me    I should be taking notes.

724
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,555
你知道吗?我已经讨厌这样了。
You know what?       I hate this already.

725
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,723
-只说明你做对了。-(手机铃声)
-Just means      you're doing it right.      -(cell phone chiming)

726
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,724
马特奥(笑)
(Mateo laughs)

727
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:02,951
宝贝，谁在打你的电话?
NANCY: Baby, who is      blowing up your phone?

728
00:26:02,953 --> 00:26:04,303
哦，是哈桑。
Oh, it's Hassan.

729
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:05,729
他邀请我去他的街头服饰快闪店
Uh, he invited me     to his streetwear pop-up

730
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,880
市中心。
downtown later.

731
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:08,290
哈桑吗?
Hassan?

732
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,475
等等，你要比我先去第二次约会吗?
Wait, so you're getting    a second date before I am?

733
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:11,476
(咯咯地笑)太好了。
(chuckles) That's great.

734
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:13,462
你知道吗?我要咬紧牙关
You know what?  I'm just gonna bite the bullet

735
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:15,555
我要给福扎发短信，看他是否感兴趣。
and I'm going to text Fauza   and see if he's interested.

736
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:16,982
-不，不，不!-你怎么了?
-No, no, no, no!     -What's wrong with you?

737
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:18,409
-不要，不要那样做。-为什么不呢?
-Don't-don't do that.      -Why not?

738
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:21,470
因为如果你先给他发短信，会显得你很渴。
Because if you text him first,  you're gonna look thirsty.

739
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:24,230
-嗯。-所以他可以先给我发短信，
-Mm-hmm.      -So it's okay for him      to text me first,

740
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:25,974
但反过来不是吗?
but not the other way around?

741
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,067
-是的。-为什么?
-Yes.              -Why?

742
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:28,327
(平静地)父权制。
(quietly) The patriarchy.

743
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,087
等一下，好吗?
Just wait it out      for a second, alright?

744
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,815
也许他只是想装酷什么的。
Maybe he's just trying  to play it cool or something.

745
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:33,816
为了什么?
For what?

746
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,260
这样他就能增加我的需求和焦虑
So that he can amp up     my neediness and anxiety

747
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,488
就为了用一条短信来缓解情绪吗?
only to relieve it in a rush with one single text?

748
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,340
你确定你以前没约过会?
You sure you've       never dated before?

749
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:42,600
你知道吗?
MARJAN:          You know what?

750
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,661
我才不会上你这鬼话的当。
I am not gonna fall   for this manipulative crap.

751
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:47,104
我正式把手机收起来了。
I'm officially      putting away my phone.

752
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,731
-好的吗?-(手机哨声)
-Okay?      -(cell phone whistles)

753
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,127
是，是他。
It, it's him.

754
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:54,594
他给我发短信。(咯咯地笑)
He text me. (giggles)

755
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,762
他给我发短信。
He text me.

756
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,523
(咯咯地笑)你真是个笨蛋。
(giggles) You're such a dork.

757
00:26:58,525 --> 00:26:59,116
哦……
Oh...

758
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,009
她现在就在里面。
She is in it now.

759
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:02,745
是啊，她现在真的深陷其中了。
Oh, yeah,     she is really in it now.

760
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,295
(叹息)

不完全是。我丈夫已经入住了。

他叫亚西尔·卡里姆。

776
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,848
你能告诉我他在哪个房间吗?

——K-A-R-I-M。对不起。
-It's K-A-R-I-M.        -DESK CLERK: Sorry.

00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,190
我有身份证，如果有帮助的话。

782
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,674
事实上，它并没有。

787
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:24,259
他的车在前面。我知道他在这里。

788
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:25,427
那也许你该打给他

问他住在哪个房间。

好吧，我知道他和另一个女人在一起。
Okay, look, I know he's here   with another woman.

797
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:45,889
我只是想和他谈谈。
I just need to speak to him.

798
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:46,965
就像我在问你一样
You know,       like I'm asking you

799

00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,396
再说一次，我必须这么做

802
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,957
提醒您一下我们酒店的政策。
remind you of our hotel policy.

803
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,977
我才不管你那愚蠢的酒店政策。
I don't care about    your stupid hotel policy.

804
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:01,238
去你的酒店政策。
The hell with you      and your hotel policy.

如果有必要，我会敲开这家酒店的每一扇门。
I will bang on every door   in this hotel if I have to.

806
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:04,800

807
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:05,984
这真的不是酒店。
This really isn't a hotel.

808
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,062
这就是所谓的秘密汽车旅馆。
It's what you call         a no-tell motel.

809
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:11,397
所以我不会说出去。
So I'm not gonna tell.

810
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,158
相信我，你不是第一个妻子
Believe me,    you're not the first wife

Okay?

815
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,500
现在我得请你离开了。
Now I'm gonna    have to ask you to leave.

816

你不能这样对待别人。

00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:07,030
-(汽笛声)-(喇叭鸣)
-(siren wailing)          -(horn blares)

843
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,074
(模糊聊天)
(indistinct chatter)

844
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,351
这里到底发生了什么?
What the hell happened here?

845
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,095
显然，一个女人发生了激烈的争执
Apparently, a woman       had a heated dispute

846
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:14,279
和服务台职员一起。
with the desk clerk there.

847
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,264
然后就开始横冲直撞
Then went on a rampage

848
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:18,858
带着她从工地偷来的防滑方向盘。
with this skid steer she stole   from that construction site.

849
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,877
知道她为什么这么做吗?
Any idea what set her off?

850
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,770
据店员说，她已经怀孕七个月了
According to the clerk,   she's seven months pregnant

851
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:24,214
她丈夫和另一个女人在汽车旅馆里。
and her husband's somewhere in the motel with another woman.

852
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,199
-好吧，这样就行了。-是的。
-Well, that'll do it.      -Yeah.

853
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:27,792
知道她在哪吗?
Any idea where she is?

854
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:29,386
受害者，不是情妇。
The-the victim,        not the mistress.

855
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,296
是啊，被困在那堆东西下面。
Yeah, trapped      under that pile there.

856
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:32,280
汤米:她怀孕七个月了?
TOMMY: And she's      seven months pregnant?

857
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:33,115
知道她有没有受伤吗?
Do we know if she's injured?

858
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:34,224
她在说话，说她很好
She's talking, says she's fine,

859
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,801
但我们还没能联系到她确认。
but we haven't been able    to get to her to confirm.

860
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,896
好的，维加上尉，准备。
Alright, Captain Vega,      stand by.

861
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,622
我们得保护这片区域。
We gotta secure this area.

862
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:41,973
好了,126。
Alright, 126.

863
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:43,883
思特里克兰德，里卡多，夹板和支柱。
Strickland, Ricardo,       cribbing and struts.

864
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:46,461
加拉格尔，查维斯，马尔瓦尼，你们去撤离。
Gallagher, Chavez, Marwani,   you're on extraction.

865
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:48,130
-把我们的受害者/嫌疑人带出来。马特奥:没错。
-Get out our victim/suspect.   -MATEO: Yep.

866
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:49,147
让我们努力把这件事做完
Let's try to       get this thing done

867
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:51,241
在整个事件发生之前。
before the whole thing      comes down.

868
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,636
伙计们，大摇大摆，都准备好了。
Hey, guys, the strut,     it's all set over here.

869
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:56,138
MARJAN:好的。
MARJAN: Alright.

870
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,806
(团队聊天)
(team chattering)

871
00:31:58,308 --> 00:31:59,991
我来推，你来撬三下。
MATEO:  I-I'll push, you pry on three.

872
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,960
好的，一，二，三。
Okay, one, two, three.

873
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,713
(普通员工)
(grunts)

874
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:07,699
马特奥:把这个拿开。
MATEO:    Get this out of your way.

875
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:08,908
(Marjan普通员工)
(Marjan grunts)

876
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,834
女士，你受伤了吗?
Hey, ma'am, are you hurt?

877
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,744
我不这么认为。
I don't think so, no.

878
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:13,079
你开门了吗?
You got the door?

879
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,097
好吧。孩子怎么样了?
Alright. How's the baby?

880
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,432
她在踢腿，但这并不新鲜。
She's kicking,       but that's not new.

881
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,325
好吧，抓住我的手，我们要
Okay, take my hand        and we're gonna

882
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:18,493
带你出去，好吗?
get you out of here, alright?

883
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:20,512
不，我要留在这里。你离开了我。
No, I'm gonna stay here.     You leave me.

884
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:22,755
这不是一个选择。整个笼子可能会坍塌
That's not an option.  This whole cage could collapse

885
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:24,942
-随时会毁了你和你的孩子(金属磨)
-and crush you  and your baby any second now.  -(metal grinding)

886
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,002
(叹气)一切都已经被粉碎了。
(sighs) Everything        is already crushed.

887
00:32:27,004 --> 00:32:28,136
有什么不同?
What's the difference?

888
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:29,947
(声音嘶哑)我失去了一切。
(voice breaking)      I've lost everything.

889
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,764
这不是真的。你的孩子还在。
That's not true.    You still have your baby.

890
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:32,616
你们将拥有彼此。
You will have each other.

891
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,509
不，我不会。我要进监狱了。
No, I won't.     I'm gonna be in prison.

892
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:37,496
出轨的人会得到抚养权。
And the cheating cheater's    gonna get custody.

893
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,291
没有哪个法官会对一个孕妇严厉惩罚
No judge is gonna throw the book at a pregnant woman

894
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,960
她在为她的家庭而战。
who is fighting for her family.

895
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,686
-在德州也没有。-尤其是在德州。
-Not even in Texas.    -Especially not in Texas.

896
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:47,872
牵着我的手，让我们给你的宝贝女儿看看
So take my hand  and let us show your baby girl

897
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,591
她妈妈是多么坚强。
how strong her mom is.

898
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,303
好吧。好吧。
Okay. Okay.

899
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,121
来，拿着这个。我明白了。
-MARJAN: Here, take this.    -MATEO: I got it.

900
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:55,973
法拉:好的。
FARA: Okay.

901
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,457
(普通员工)
(grunts)

902
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:59,034
你做得很好。来吧。
MARJAN:        You're doing great.             Come on.

903
00:32:59,036 --> 00:33:01,069
法拉:(气喘吁吁)对不起。
FARA:       (panting) I'm sorry.

904
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:02,387
你是好的。来吧。
You're okay. Come on.

905
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:04,523
-她要出来了，上尉。-没错。
-She's coming out, Cap.      -PAUL: That's right.

906
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:10,278
♪
♪

907
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,218
-(监控器哔哔声)-她的血压和生命体征正常。
-(monitor beeps)   -Her BP and vitals are good.

908
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,977
TK，胎儿监护仪怎么说?
TK, what's    the fetal monitor saying?

909
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:20,071
宝宝的心跳是199，队长。
Baby's heartbeat is at 199, Cap.

910
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:21,072
这很糟糕吗?
Is that bad?

911
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,482
有点快，
It is a little fast,

912
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:23,725
但这也是意料之中的
but that's also expected

913
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,319
考虑到你们俩经历的冒险。
given the adventure that   the two of you have been on.

914
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,746
西园医院会给你做检查的，
Uh, West Park will        take a look at you,

915
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:28,747
但我并不担心。
but I'm not concerned.

916
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:29,822
谢谢你！
Thank you.

917
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,175
谢谢你给我讲道理。
Thank you for    talking some sense to me.

918
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,569
-她怎么样?她很好。
-How's she doin'?        -TOMMY: She's good.

919
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,404
这位警官要和你谈谈。
This officer needs        to talk to you.

920
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:38,348
我被逮捕了，是吗?
Oh, I'm being arrested, huh?

921
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,257
恐怕是。
Afraid so.

922
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:40,925
你没必要给她戴上手铐吧?
You don't have     to handcuff her, do you?

923
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:42,519
我想我们可以跳过这部分，
I think we can skip that part,

924
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,262
但我必须宣读你的权利
but I do have to      read you your rights.

925
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:46,114
是的,很好。我明白了。
Yes, fine. I understand.

926
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:47,024
我聚氨酯——
I pu--

927
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,841
(模糊聊天)
(indistinct chatter)

928
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,843
亚西尔，你这个混蛋!
Yasir, you rat bastard!

929
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:52,420
(模糊的无线电杂音)
(indistinct radio chatter)

930
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,256
法拉?上帝会为此惩罚你的
-Fara?  -God's gonna get you for this

931
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:55,681
我妈妈也是!
and so is my mother!

932
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:56,925
-那是…-是
-Is that--            -Yeah.

933
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:57,926
是的，它是。
Yes, it is.

934
00:33:57,928 --> 00:34:00,595
福扎，怎么回事，伙计?
Uh, Fauza, what the hell, dude?

935
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:01,354
Marjan吗?
Marjan?

936
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:03,874
等待。你认识她吗?你认识他吗?
Wait. You know her?       You know him?

937
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:07,210
不是亚西尔，不过是福扎。
Uh, not as Yasir,        but, yeah, Fauza.

938
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,694
法——那是他哥哥的名字。
FARA: Fa-- that's his brother's name.

939
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:10,105
他有一个双胞胎兄弟吗?
Does he have a twin?

940
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:11,439
法拉:呃，不。
FARA: Uh, no.

941
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:12,941
我的律师会告诉你的
Oh, you're gonna     hear it from my lawyers

942
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:14,009
还有我所有的叔叔们!
and all my uncles!

943
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,053
请带我走吧，先生。
Please take me away, sir.

944
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:18,280
不，你得跟他们一起去。
Um, no, you're       gonna go with them.

945
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:19,681
我…我们医院见。
I'll, I'll meet you         in the hospital.

946
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:22,284
好吧，让我们…
Well, let's, um...

947
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,895
你也可以忘了周六晚上的事。
You can forget about       Saturday night, too.

948
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,397
(叹气)这太令人失望了。
(sighs) This is        so disappointing.

949
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,691
你……
You...

950
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,319
都令人失望。
are a disappointment.

951
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,696
(警笛声响)
(siren chirps)

952
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,151
TK !真是个惊喜。
TK! What a nice surprise.

953
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:41,486
嘿，现在不方便吗?
Hey, is this a bad time?

954
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:42,320
不，不，不。一点也不
No, no, no. Not at all.

955
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:44,155
我知道我应该先打个电话，但是
I know I should        have called, but--

956
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:45,707
我闻到炸鸡味了吗?
Do I smell fried chicken?

957
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:47,367
也许吧。
Maybe.

958
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:49,160
爸爸，你太迷人了
TK:      Dad, are you crushing

959
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:51,246
一个人吃一整桶鸡肉?
an entire bucket     of chicken by yourself?

960
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,148
鸡桶。
Chicken buckets.

961
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,649
粗略的一天?
Rough day?

962
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,483
哦，是福扎。
Oh, it's Fauza.

963
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:57,319
-真让人失望。-是的。
-What a disappointment.     -Yeah.

964
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:58,411
它们掉下来的时候很奇怪
It's weird when they drop

965
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:00,989
你的前任配偶炸弹。
the preexisting       spouse bomb on you.

966
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,099
哦，对了。
Oh, that's right.

967
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,916
好吧，至少卡洛斯和他的离婚了。
Well, at least       Carlos divorced his.

968
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:05,327
无效，但是，是的。
Annulled, but, yes.

969
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:07,253
这对我们来说从来不是个问题。
And that was never        a question for us.

970
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:09,088
现在，孩子们的问题。
Now, the kids question.

971
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,498
哇，等一下。他有个孩子?
Whoa, wait a minute.       He has a kid?

972
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,110
-不，他没有孩子。-哦。(嘲笑)
-No, he-he doesn't have a kid.  -Oh. (scoffs)

973
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:16,521
我刚发现他从来都不想这么做。
I just found out     that he never wants to.

974
00:35:17,174 --> 00:35:19,023
听起来你需要点鸡肉。
Sounds like you could      use some chicken.

975
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:20,492
(TK叹了口气)
(TK sighs)

976
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,209
-这怎么这么好?毫米。对吧?
-How's this so good?       -Mm. Right?

977
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:31,378
你知道我害怕什么吗，爸爸?
You know what scares me, Dad?

978
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,355
是关于我们的，
Is what it says about us,

979
00:35:33,357 --> 00:35:34,689
我们从来没有讨论过。
that we've never        even discussed it.

980
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,876
我看你是故意回避谈话的。
It says to me you avoided   the conversation on purpose.

981
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:38,969
避免了吗?
Avoided?

982
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,362
我不回避。
I don't avoid.

983
00:35:40,364 --> 00:35:43,865
我想你没问过TK孩子的事
I think you didn't         ask TK about kids

984
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:47,202
因为你知道他会怎么回答。
because you knew    what his answer would be.

985
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,311
我们在一个如此好的地方。
We're in such a good place.

986
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,039
而且，我们最近真的很忙。
Also, we've been        really busy lately.

987
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,891
三年了，卡利托斯?
For three years, Carlitos?

988
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,042
<i>请帮忙
<i> Por favor.</i>

989
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,968
你得做得更好才行。
You're gonna   have to do better than that.

990
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,562
人们都很忙。这就是问题所在。
People get busy.        That's the thing.

991
00:35:57,564 --> 00:35:58,563
是的，但是不太忙
Yeah, but not too busy

992
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,490
进行如此基础的对话。
to have a conversation      so foundational.

993
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,233
健康的夫妻不会这么做。
And that's not     what healthy couples do.

994
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:04,161
你妈妈和我从来没讨论过
You know, your mother      and I never discussed

995
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,478
你会信仰什么宗教
what religion you were gonna be

996
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,238
直到我无意中听到她在安排你的割礼
until I overheard her      scheduling your bris

997
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,498
在产房。
in the delivery room.

998
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,560
不用说，一场热烈的谈话随之而来。
Needless to say, a very  animated conversation ensued.

999
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:14,504
你不觉得是因为我上瘾了吗?
You don't think   it's because I'm an addict?

1000
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,505
他担心我会旧病复发?
He's worried that I'll relapse?

1001
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:17,565
也许这才是真正困扰你的。
Maybe that's what's      really bothering you.

1002
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:21,085
不。我全心全意地相信TK的康复。
No. I believe in TK's recovery  with my whole heart.

1003
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,679
这就是他说的原因吗?
Is that what he said       the reason was?

1004
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:26,624
不。他说是因为他想让我们去环游世界。
No. He said it's because he wants us to travel the world.

1005
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:28,092
(笑)
(laughs)

1006
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,837
怎么啦？我这辈子只离开过这个州两次。
What?    I've only left the state,    like, twice in my life.

1007
00:36:32,432 --> 00:36:35,083
我们两次都得让你又踢又叫。
And we had to take you      kicking and screaming      both times.

1008
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:40,363
(咯咯地笑)在布兰森过了一个周末后，你想家了。
(chuckles) You got homesick   after a weekend in Branson.

1009
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,366
<i> Ay, mi amor.</i> .
<i> Ay, mi amor.</i>

1010
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,777
你为什么不告诉我你到底在烦恼什么?
Why don't you tell me   what's really bothering you?

1011
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,764
说实话，我觉得大声说出来不太舒服。
Honestly, I don't feel comfortable saying it out loud.

1012
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:51,524
是你担心吗
Is it that you're worried

1013
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:53,526
孩子的生命中没有母亲了吗?
that the child's not gonna   have a mother in their life?

1014
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:57,105
因为我在你身边，你的姐妹们也是。
Because I'm here for you,    and so are your sisters.

1015
00:36:57,107 --> 00:36:58,414
我知道。
I know you are.

1016
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,701
我不担心孩子的母亲会是谁。
I'm not worried about     who the mother will be.

1017
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,762
我很担心谁会成为孩子的父亲。
I'm worried about  who's going to be the father.

1018
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,039
我说的不是TK。
And I don't mean TK.

1019
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,633
都怪你。加吗?
-TK: I blame you.        -Me?

1020
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:12,229
是啊，因为我现在父子关系很好，
Yeah, because    I have such a great    father/son situation here,

1021
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,231
我想把爱传递出去。
I wanted to, you know,      pay it forward.

1022
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:17,067
TK和欧文一直有着特殊的关系
TK and Owen have always had   such a special relationship

1023
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,401
从他很小的时候开始。
from the time he was little.

1024
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,738
直到两年前我才开始和我爸爸一起做。
I didn't start one with my dad  until two years ago.

1025
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,022
事实并非如此。
That is not true.

1026
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:24,649
恐怕我达不到标准。
I'm afraid I won't measure up.

1027
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:26,559
但我也不想逼他做什么
But I also don't wanna     push him into something

1028
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:27,635
他不想要的。
that he doesn't want.

1029
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,229
这让我有同情心还是自私?
Does that make me    compassionate or selfish?

1030
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:32,474
我不能回答这个问题，但我可以告诉你
I can't answer that,     but what I can tell you

1031
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:35,901
几乎每次我都把你妈妈的需求放在我的需求之前
is almost every time I put your mother's needs before mine,

1032
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:37,087
结果我更快乐了
I ended up being happier

1033
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,089
如果我得到了我想要的
than if I'd gotten     what I thought I wanted.

1034
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,832
你是说我应该放弃这个梦吗?
So you're saying   I should give up the dream?

1035
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:43,093
不。
No.

1036
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,411
我的意思是你得体谅别人
What I'm saying is that    you have to be considerate

1037
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,323
他的感受和你的感受一样重要。
for his feelings    just as much as your own.

1038
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:50,350
不管你怎么决定…
And whatever you decide...

1039
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:52,994
你得跟他说实话。
you have to be         honest with him.

1040
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:54,329
接受宇宙给予你的一切。
And take what     the universe gives you.

1041
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:57,107
因为无论发生什么，<i> mijo，</i>
Because no matter        what happens,<i> mijo,</i>

1042
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,924
最重要的是……
the most important thing...

1043
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:01,185
是TK在我身边。
Is that TK's by my side.

1044
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,488
…因为卡洛斯是我的人。
...'cause Carlos is my person.

1045
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:06,491
♪♪
♪♪

1046
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,515
好吧。我有葡萄叶，米饭，还有大蒜。
Okay. I got grape leaves,  I got rice, and I got garlic.

1047
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:18,110
你得到薄荷。我去拿阿勒颇胡椒。
You get the mint.           I'm gonna get        the Aleppo pepper.

1048
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,523
正确的。我们需要snoubar。
Right. And we need snoubar.

1049
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:23,282
Snoubar吗?什么是snoubar?
Snoubar? What is snoubar?

1050
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:24,950
可能在松子下面。
Probably under pine nuts.

1051
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:26,452
不，阿莎对坚果过敏。
Oh, no,     Asha's allergic to nuts.

1052
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:27,804
-哦。-如果我们不用它会毁了它吗?
-Oh.       -Is it gonna ruin it       if we don't use it?

1053
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,763
不，一切都很好。
No, it's all good.

1054
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,792
其实，我想说谢谢你。
Actually, you know,   I-I wanted to say thank you.

1055
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:35,461
谢谢你们请我来吃晚饭。
Um, I appreciate you guys   inviting me over for dinner.

1056
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:37,372
但是，如果你想一个人过夜
But, you know, if you wanna   spend the night alone

1057
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,982
作为夫妻，我完全理解。
as a couple, I totally get it.

1058
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,466
我不想当电灯泡。
I don't wanna be          a third wheel.

1059
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:42,485
Marjan，我们不是在邀请你。你在帮我做饭。
Marjan, we are not inviting you. You're helping me cook.

1060
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,379
不然我还能做什么
How else am       I supposed to make a

1061
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,656
正宗的黎巴嫩薄饼?
authentic    Lebanese mezze by myself?

1062
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,716
-(笑)是啊，那会是一场灾难。(嘲笑)
-(chuckles) Yeah,    that would be a disaster.    -(scoffs)

1063
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:50,827
-好的，我们需要茄子做印度辣酱。-是的。
-Okay, we need eggplant     for baba ghanoush.     -Yes.

1064
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,311
两个:哦!
BOTH: Oh!

1065
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,888
保罗:哦。教练乔。-嘿，你们两个!
-PAUL: Oh. Trainer Joe.     -Hey, you two!

1066
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,223
嘿。
Hey.

1067
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:56,891
你，你在这里做什么…
What are you,    what are you doing here...

1068
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:58,059
在清真市场?
in a halal market?

1069
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:59,336
我只吃清真肉
Well, I only eat halal meat,

1070
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,063
我觉得自己就像上等腰牛排
and I felt like a porterhouse.

1071
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:03,231
你是穆斯林?
You're Muslim?

1072
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:04,916
这真的令人震惊吗?
Is that really such a shock?

1073
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:06,659
是的，有点，你知道的。
Yeah, kinda, you know.

1074
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,429
因为我是布莱克，我叫乔?
Because I'm Black        and my name is Joe?

1075
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,790
我逗你是因为我是黑人
I was only messing with you   because I am Black

1076
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:13,758
但我其实叫优素福。
but my name is actually Yusuf.

1077
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,076
(笑)。
(laughs) Right.

1078
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:17,095
好吧，那你怎么从来没提过
Okay, well, how come you     never mentioned that

1079
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:18,429
在我们的疗程中?
in any of our sessions?

1080
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:21,432
我为什么要这么做?我不会把个人生活带到工作中。
Why would I? I don't bring     my personal life to work.

1081
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:23,935
-是的，我尊重这一点。是的。乔:是啊。
-Yeah, I respect that. Yeah.   -JOE: Yeah.

1082

(laughter)

1085
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:35,613
好吧。很高兴能遇到你，乔。优素福。
Alright. It was, uh, it was nice running into you, Joe. Yusuf.

1086
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:38,416
你也是。周四见。
Uh, you, too.      I'll see you Thursday.

也许你今晚想见我?
maybe you wanna see me tonight?

1089
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,048
我要去这家伙家
I'm-I'm going       to this guy's house

1090
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,365
和女朋友一起吃晚饭
with his girlfriend for dinner,

1091
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,718
我真的需要一个电灯泡
and I could really use      a fourth wheel.

1092
00:39:49,963 --> 00:39:51,462
我不知道。
I don't know.

1093
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:53,448
我的天啊。我很抱歉。
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1094
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,874
我很抱歉。当我没问。
I'm sorry.       Forget I even asked.

1095
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,117
乔:我想说，我不知道
JOE:         I was gonna say,         I don't know

1096
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,469
如果一份上等腰牛排就够了。
if one porterhouse         would be enough.

1097
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:01,122
你在耍我。乔:啊。
-You're messin' with me.     -JOE: Aah.

1098
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:03,066
-我逗你玩呢。-(Marjan, Joe笑)
-I was messing with you.     -(Marjan, Joe laugh)

1099
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,959
我很乐意。
I would love to.

1100
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:06,611
-是吗?乔:是啊。
-Yeah?           -JOE: Yeah.

1101
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:09,489
酷。(笑)
Cool. (laughs)

1102
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:13,660
-他想让我——是的。-是的。是的，他喜欢。
-He wants me to-- Yeah.     -Yes. Yes, he does.

1103
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,249
(街道环境噪音)
(ambient street noise)

1104
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:26,998
-嘿,宝贝。-你好。完美的时机。
-Hey, babe.       -Hi. Perfect timing.

1105
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,008
你今天过得怎么样?改善情况。
-How was your day?        -Good.

1106
00:40:30,654 --> 00:40:33,171
-你在做饭?威灵顿牛肉。
-What are you cooking?      -Beef Wellington.

1107
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:34,973
要我给你拿杯酒吗?
Can I get you a glass of wine?

1108
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,158
首先，告诉我是什么场合。
First, tell me the occasion.

1109
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,268
任何场合。
No occasion.

1110
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,344
只是和你在一起的每一晚
Just every night that     I get to spend with you

1111
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:41,688
是一个值得庆祝的夜晚。
is a night worth celebrating.

1112
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:43,998
别担心。
Don't worry.

1113
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,525
这不是贿赂。
This isn't a bribe.

1114
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:51,239
这个也不是。
Well, neither is this.

1115
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:55,935
(咯咯地笑)这是什么?
(chuckles) What is this?

1116
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:57,178
这是个惊喜。
It's a surprise.

1117
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,862
(模仿布拉德·皮特)盒子里是什么?
(imitating Brad Pitt)       What's in the box?

1118
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:58,955
盒子里是什么?
What's in the box?

1119
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:00,957
你演得像极了布拉德·皮特，知道吗?
You do a horrible Brad Pitt,   you know that?

1120
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,033
我知道，但你喜欢。
I know, but you love it.

1121
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:03,442
其实我不喜欢，但我爱你。
I don't, actually,        but I do love you.

1122
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:06,020
-那么，去吧，打开它。——(TK吸入)
-So, go on, open it.       -(TK inhales)

1123
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:07,255
(TK呼出)
(TK exhales)

1124
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,967
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

1125
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,969
有胡子的龙?
A bearded dragon?

1126
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,029
-宝贝，这太可怕了
-Babe, it's--          -Terrifying.

1127
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:16,598
美丽。

1128
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,866
哇。
Wow.

1129
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:21,126
嘿，小家伙。
Hey, little buddy.

1130
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,437
嘿。(笑)
Hey. (chuckles)

1131
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,296
嘿，小家伙。

1132
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:25,965
我知道你准备好当父亲了。
I know you're ready       to be a father.

1133
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:29,569
我毫不怀疑你会成为一个了不起的人。
And I have no doubt that   you would be an amazing one.

1134
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,031
但我不确定我能做到。
But I'm not so sure       I'm there yet.

1135
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,409
或者永远不会。
Or ever will be.

1136
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:39,078
TK:嗯。
TK: Hmm.

1137
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:44,225
我只是想跟你说实话
I just wanted      to be honest with you

1138
00:41:44,227 --> 00:41:47,003
说这可能是唯一的孩子
and say that    this may be the only child

1139
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,088
我们曾经一起分享过。
we ever share together.

1140
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,465
好吧。
Okay.

1141
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:52,825
好吧?
Okay?

1142
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:53,760
好吧。
Okay.

1143
00:41:54,954 --> 00:41:56,254
真的吗?你确定吗?
Really? Are you sure?

1144
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:59,349
卡洛斯，你能接受我的同意吗?
Carlos, would you        just take the yes?

1145
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,309
好吧。
Okay.

1146
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,478
是的,TK。
Yes, TK.

1147
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:12,177
而且，他们告诉我它喜欢吃活蟋蟀。
Also, they told me  it likes to eat live crickets.

1148
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:14,030
-那就是你的工作了。——(TK笑)
-So, that's gonna be your job.  -(TK laughs)

1149
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,274
我明白了。
TK:            I got it.

1150
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:19,202
我们该给这个小家伙取什么名字?
What should     we name this little guy?

1151
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,205
我在想路易二世或者卢二世。
I was thinking Louis the Second or Lou II.

1152
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,782
我们为什么不问问他呢?让我们看看他更喜欢哪一个。
Why don't we ask him?      Let's see which one      he likes better.

1153
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:25,750
-好的。-好的。
-Okay.              -Okay.

1154
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:29,712
哦,废话。
Ohh, crap.

1155
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,757
他已经出来了，不是吗?
He already got out,       didn't he?

1156
00:42:33,943 --> 00:42:35,885
不可能走远，对吧?
Couldn't have         gone far, right?

1157
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,638
路易二世?
Uh, Louis the Second?

1158
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:41,783
(咕哝)路二世?
(grunts) Lou II?

1159
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:42,725
我再也睡不着了。
I'm never sleeping again.

1160
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:45,478
哦,男孩。
Oh, boy.
