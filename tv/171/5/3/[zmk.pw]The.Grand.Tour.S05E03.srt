1
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,760
你好，還有
歡迎來到壯游
Hello, and
welcome to The Grand Tour,

2
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,799
還有這輛蘭博基尼
胡拉坎·斯特拉托。
and this, the Lamborghini
Huracan Sterrato.

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,519
與普通的 Huracan 不同，
被設計的
Unlike the normal Huracan,
which was designed

4
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,039
很晚在市中心徘徊
晚上每小時九英里，
to prowl round city centres late
at night doing nine miles an hour,

5
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,560
這是為了
衝過沙漠
this was designed to
blast across a desert

6
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,960
做了一百六十。
doing a hundred and sixty.

7
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,799
它有車頂架，它
得到了喇叭形的輪拱，
It's got the roof racks, it's
got the flared wheel arches,

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,359
它有加強的底面，
長行程懸掛。
it's got beefed-up undersides,
long-travel suspension.

9
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,759
這是蘭博基尼
「盜賊英雄」。
It is the Lamborghini
'Rogue Hero'.

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,680
這不僅僅是蘭博基尼
參與沙漠襲擊行動。
And it's not just Lamborghini
getting in on the desert raid act.

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,000
這，就是保時捷 911 達喀爾。
This, is the Porsche 911 Dakar.

12
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,039
它有四輪
驅動器、防滑板
It has four-wheel
drive, skid plates

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,000
還有五十毫米的地面
比普通 911 的間隙更大。
and fifty millimetres more ground
clearance than a regular 911.

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,760
就連摩根也想嘗試一下。
Even Morgan's having a go.

15
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,680
是的，這就是 CXT，
它也站在高蹺上。
Yup, this is the CXT and
it too stands upon stilts.

16
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,319
它是可調節的
拉力賽規格減震器
It's got adjustable
rally spec dampers

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
和一個外部防滾架。
and an external roll cage.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
好的。
Nice.

19
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,360
所有這些車都是
當然非常巨大，
All these cars are
of course very tremendous,

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,400
但它們也非常不便宜。
but they're also very not cheap.

21
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,879
這輛保時捷重 173,000 磅。
The Porsche is a 173,000 pounds.

22
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,039
摩根是 204,000
The Morgan is 204,000

23
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,439
這是 250,000。
and this is 250,000.

24
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,960
這引起了我們的思考。
And that got us thinking.

25
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,680
我們能否建立一個
拉力襲擊車便宜嗎？
Could we build a
rally raid car for less?

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,159
少了很多。
A lot less.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,240
讓我們來一個
看看我們買了什麼。
Let's have a
look at what we've bought.

28
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,759
我為此而去，
瑪莎拉蒂 GranCabrio,
I went for this, a
Maserati GranCabrio,

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,240
我剛剛付了錢
26,000 磅以下。
for which I paid just
under 26,000 pounds.

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,199
理查德哈蒙德買了這個，
Richard Hammond has bought this,

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,560
這是一輛阿斯頓·馬丁
DB9 V12 沃蘭特,
it's an Aston Martin
DB9 V12 Volante,

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,199
這花費了他 22,000 英鎊。
which cost him 22,000 pounds.

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,080
還有傑裡米·克拉克森，
這，捷豹 F-Type V6S，
And Jeremy Clarkson,
this, the Jaguar F-Type V6S,

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,000
25,000 英鎊。
25,000 pounds.

35
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,919
不用說，
我們剛剛收到一條短信
And needless to say,
we've just had a text

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,639
來自威爾曼先生。
from Mr Wilman.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,639
繼續。
Go on.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
它說，
It says,

39
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,560
「你現在將把你的
購買沙漠賽車手。
"You will now turn your
purchases into desert racers.

40
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,039
「當你完成後，你會
到火車站報到
"When you finish, you will
report to the railway station

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,000
「在楚姆鎮，
這是在毛裡塔尼亞。」
"in the town of Choum,
which is in Mauritania."

42
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,960
毛裡塔尼亞在哪裡？
Where's Mauritania?

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,800
也許他拼錯了毛里求斯？
Perhaps he's misspelt Mauritius?

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
嗯，它不在任何地方。
Well, it isn't anywhere.

45
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,000
這不是一個真實的地方。
It's not a real place.

46
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,055
- 嗯，毛裡塔尼亞。
- 你在說什麼？
- Well, Mauritania.
- What are you on about?

47
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,079
快點。
Come on.

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
「獅子，女巫，
和鏡子，」
"The Lion, the Witch,
and the Looking Glass,"

49
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,560
「愛麗絲通過
衣櫃」，所有這些。
"Alice Through the
Wardrobe," all of that.

50
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,216
你通過
衣櫃後面，
You go through the
back of the wardrobe,

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,000
你愉快地打招呼
當你經過時會說話的獅子，
you say a cheery hello to
the talking lion as you pass in,

52
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,000
你要留意
跑來跑去的人們
and you watch out for
the people running about

53
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,639
用撲克牌
作為戰袍。
with playing cards
on as tabards.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,079
你有CS劉易斯
在那裡迴響。
You've got C.S. Lewis
echoing around in there.

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,719
- 是的。
——劉易斯·卡羅爾。
- Yes.
- Lewis Carroll.

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
它們不是旅遊書。
They were not travel books.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,240
你不
認為這個地方存在嗎？
You don't
think this place exists?

58
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,159
沒有這樣的
毛裡塔尼亞！
There's no such
place as Mauritania!

59
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,800
然而事實證明，
有一個地方，就是毛裡塔尼亞。
It turns out, however,
there is such a place as Mauritania.

60
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,120
這是一名前法國人
西非殖民地。
It's a former French
colony in West Africa.

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,360
這就是它的樣子。
And this is what it looks like.

62
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,000
這個幅員遼闊的國家的三分之二，
Two thirds of this vast country,

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,040
它比
英國，已被埋葬...
it's four times bigger than
the UK, has been buried...

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
撒哈拉沙漠。
by the Sahara Desert.

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,199
這意味著對於
大多數情況下，這是一英里又一英里
Which means that for the
most part, it is mile after mile

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
什麼都沒有...
of nothing...

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,079
沒有人。
and nobody.

68
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,639
但是在這裡，
But here,

69
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,879
在這個巨大的中間
過熱空海，
in the middle of this gigantic
sea of super-heated emptiness,

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
有一條鐵路線，
there is a railway line,

71
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,199
它確實穿過了小
我們被告知要去報道的城鎮...
and it does pass through the small
town we've been told to report to...

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,759
楚姆。
Choum.

73
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,040
我聽說你會得到更多
在毛裡塔尼亞用你的錢。
I'm told you get a lot more
for your money in Mauritania.

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,560
我以為會更多
色彩繽紛，還有會說話的動物。
I thought it'd be more
colourful, with talking animals.

75
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,360
這是美好而安靜的。
It's nice and quiet.

76
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,776
- 不是嗎？
- 是的。
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,439
天氣太熱了，無法發出任何聲音。
It's too hot to make any noise.

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,920
真的很熱。
It's really hot.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,160
- 46 度。
- 哦！
- 46 degrees.
- Ooh!

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,560
雖然是乾熱。
It's a dry heat though.

81
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,576
- 別說，我討厭那樣。
- 我討厭人...
- Don't say, I hate that.
- I hate people...

82
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
就是太熱了！
It's just hot!

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,175
- 哦，有一家餐廳。
- 在哪裡？
- Ooh, there's a restaurant.
- Where?

84
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,016
讓我們來一個...
哦，我們買不到啤酒。
Let's get a...
Oh, we can't get a beer.

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,159
- 什麼？
- 乾燥的國家。
- What?
- Dry country.

86
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,016
- 什麼？
- 毛裡塔尼亞很乾燥。
- What?
- Mauritania's dry.

87
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,800
- 嚴重地？
- 這是穆斯林。
- Seriously?
- It's Muslim.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,639
什麼樣的童話
土地不提供杜松子酒嗎？
What kind of fairy-tale
land doesn't serve gin?

89
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,279
我確實有一些輕度酒精
洗手液，如果有什麼好處的話。
I do have some mildly alcoholic
hand sanitiser, if that's any good.

90
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,680
保持住這一點。
Keep hold of that.

91
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,800
我能說它有多好嗎
Can I just say how nice it is

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,439
回來表演The Grand
遊覽，真正的大遊覽。
to be back doing The Grand
Tour, proper Grand Tour.

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,735
- 是的。
- 明白我的意思了嗎？
- Yeah.
- Know what I mean?

94
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,279
是的。某處
塵土飛揚，在這種情況下，是虛構的。
Yeah. Somewhere
dusty and in this case, imaginary.

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,000
這個男人來了嗎
在這輛貨車上做一些面板敲擊嗎？
Is this man coming to
do some panel beating on this van?

96
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,400
我知道這是什麼。
I know what this is.

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,680
這是一輛貨車。它是
一輛非常破舊的貨車。
It's a van. It's
a really old broken van.

98
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,439
威爾曼先生在我們離開之前說...
Mr Wilman said before we left...

99
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,120
他說：「我提供了一輛備用車輛
因為如果你的一輛車出了問題。」
He said, "I've provided a backup vehicle
for if one of your cars goes wrong."

100
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,120
他為什麼派了一輛貨車？
Why has he sent a van?

101
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,480
他說
這次旅行所需的一切
And he says
everything we need for this trip

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,920
是在後面的
貨車。哦，已經開放了。
is in the back of the
van. Oh, it's open.

103
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,295
你確定？你不
只是損害某人的生計嗎？
You are sure? You're not
just nicking somebody's livelihood?

104
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,800
沒有。不，他說。他說。
Nope. No, he said. He said.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,880
但它確實懇求
問題，你覺得怎麼樣
But it does beg the
question, how do you suppose

106
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
我們的車將會得到...他
說他會幫我們送貨。
our cars are gonna get... He
said he'd deliver them for us.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,319
這輛貨車有
明顯是本地買的
The van had
plainly been bought locally

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
我們是乘飛機到達的，
and we'd arrived by air,

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,800
所以哈蒙德認為那裡
只能是一個可能的答案。
so Hammond reckoned there
could only be one possible answer.

110
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,840
所以你認為火車正在行駛
帶著我們的車一起來這裡嗎？
So you think a train is going
to come along here with our cars on it?

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,079
嗯，一列火車......這很可能
去看火車的地方，不是嗎？
Well, a train... This is a likely
spot to see a train, isn't it?

112
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,360
是的，我會同意你的。
Yes, I'll grant you that.

113
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,120
是的。進出的唯一途徑是火車。
不然他們怎麼會到這裡來呢？
Yes. The only way in and out is train.
How else are they gonna get here?

114
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,839
因為沒有
自動出發板
As there were no
automated departure boards

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,079
告訴我們什麼時候
火車可能會到達，
to tell us when a
train might arrive,

116
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,279
我們坐下來等待。
we settled down for the wait.

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,199
你見過多少空的
這裡有塑料瓶裝水嗎？
Have you seen how many empty
plastic bottles of water there are here?

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,639
許多。
Many.

119
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,319
看，一個...我
意思是二、三、四、五、六、
Look, one... I
mean, two, three, four, five, six,

120
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,560
- 七，八，就在那裡，九，十。
- 是的。
- seven, eight, just there, nine, ten.
- Yeah.

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,000
我會找到
製造商並直接殺死他們。
I would find the
manufacturers and simply kill them.

122
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,040
雖然很嚴酷，但是很混亂
It's harsh, but it is a mess

123
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,855
他們將會
在這裡待很長時間了。
and they're going to
be here for a long time.

124
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,639
- 永遠。
- 這是一種浪費。
- Forever.
- It's a waste.

125
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,279
你並不經常需要等待
就在鐵軌旁的火車，是嗎？
It's not often you get to wait
for a train just by the tracks, is it?

126
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,240
不。
No.

127
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,399
- 你不能在帕丁頓這樣做。
- 不。
- You couldn't do this in Paddington.
- No.

128
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
如果它不來怎麼辦？
What if it doesn't come?

129
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,319
如果我們的車不在上面怎麼辦？
What if our cars aren't on it?

130
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,920
- 那裡。
- 在哪裡？
- There.
- Where?

131
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,560
那裡。就是這樣。
一定是這樣了。
There. That's it.
That's gotta be it.

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,360
你是對的。
Yes, you're right.

133
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,199
天哪，太巨大了！
God, it's enormous!

134
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,080
那是最大的
我見過的東西！
That is the biggest
thing I've ever seen!

135
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,120
這是最大的
我見過的東西。
It is the biggest
thing I've ever seen.

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,399
- 你能看到汽車嗎？
- 不。
- Can you see cars?
- No.

137
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,720
我的身高足以看到鐵礦石。
I'm tall enough to see iron ore.

138
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,879
- 我可以看到一些...
- 鐵礦石，鐵礦石。
- I can see bits of...
- Iron ore, iron ore.

139
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,879
- 那是什麼？
- 人們。
- What's that?
- People.

140
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,879
夥計們，那是警衛的貨車。
Chaps, that is the guard's van.

141
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,320
- 就這樣結束了。
- 看看前面是什麼...
- That is the end.
- Look what's in front...

142
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,759
- 在警衛車前面？
- 是的。看。
- In front of the guard's van?
- Yes. Look.

143
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,639
你看，這是一個平板車
這是一種不同類型的馬車。
Look, that's a flatbed one,
that's a different type of carriage.

144
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,600
- 這就像一張平板床。
- 上面有三件事。
- That's like a flatbed.
- There's three things on it.

145
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,279
- 是的！
- 他們是汽車。
- Yeah!
- They are the cars.

146
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,600
火車停了下來，
The train came to a halt,

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,519
正如我們所假設的那樣
很快就會再次出發，
and as we assumed it would
be setting off again quite soon,

148
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,320
我們必須快速工作
讓我們的車下車。
we had to work quickly
to get our cars off.

149
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,000
所以你會怎麼做？我不知道。
So what do you do? I've no clue.

150
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
通常會發生什麼
像這樣把汽車放在平板上，
What normally happens
with cars on a flatbed like this,

151
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,759
在霍恩比鐵路上，你是嗎
把它放在有坡道的壁板上
on a Hornby railway, is you
put it in a siding with a ramp

152
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,720
然後你駕駛它們
上坡道並向下。
and then you drive them
onto the ramp and down.

153
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,519
但他們已經擁有了
警衛的貨車在後面。
But they've got the
guard's van behind.

154
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,519
是的。
Yes.

155
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,456
他不會出發
沒有他警衛的貨車，是嗎？
He's not gonna set off
without his guard's van, is he?

156
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,960
不，所以一切都會順利，大概
回到……那裡一定有一個轉彎。
No, so that all goes, presumably
back to... There must be a turn there.

157
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,855
- 我們不能推動它。
- 會有一個分流器。
- We can't push it.
- There'll be a shunter.

158
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,600
這基本上是一個
全尺寸火車組。
This is basically a
full-sized train set.

159
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,560
上面會有一個分流器
另一條線，這就是鐵路的運作方式。
There'll be a shunter on the
other line, that's how railways work.

160
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,559
找到了分流器
火車上，詹姆斯與司機交談
Having found a shunter
train, James spoke to its driver

161
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,879
用他最好的法語。
in his best French.

162
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,200
「布奧納
血清。Passo il oh il to oh shuntero？」
"Buona
sera. Passo il oh il to oh shuntero?"

163
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
這聽起來有點...
That sounds a bit...

164
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,240
那可能是詹姆斯來了
帶有調車發動機，完全豎立。
That could be James coming
with a shunting engine, fully erect.

165
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,600
如果他開車的話，是的，
他會燒燬發動機的。
If he's driving it, yeah,
he'll have blown the engine.

166
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,559
如果他在的話，他會
更加興奮。
If he's on it, he will
be more aroused.

167
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,200
調車發動機。
Shunting engine.

168
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,320
- 他正在做！
- 我在調車台上！
- He's on it!
- I'm on the shunter!

169
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,519
正確的三足
老者走了過去。
Properly three-legged
old man went past.

170
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
哦是的！
Oh yes!

171
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,200
這是詹姆斯最好的一天嗎
梅的生活一下子就變了？
Is this the best day of James
May's life all of a sudden?

172
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,759
他有一個
整個鐵路網。
He's got an
entire railway network.

173
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,720
實際的全尺寸火車組。
Actual full-sized train set.

174
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,015
如果您曾經乘坐過霍恩比火車
設置後您就會確切地知道它是如何工作的。
If you've ever had a Hornby train
set you'll know exactly how this works.

175
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,200
我們開始吧。
There we go.

176
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,120
噢，他來了，
他來了。
Oh, here he comes,
here he comes.

177
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,759
當一名火車工作人員靠近時，
With a train worker approaching,

178
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,159
現在輪到我了
推出法語。
it was now my turn
to roll out the French.

179
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
先生。
Monsieur.

180
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,600
- 謝謝。
- 你你...
- Merci.
- Vous vous...

181
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,679
我是你
Je voudrais vous

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
你要...
you to...

183
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
解開。
uncouple.

184
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,159
與此同時，詹姆斯來了。
And meanwhile, here comes James.

185
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
我是來看看的
你是哪一點...
I was coming to see
which bit you were...

186
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,799
我從未見過有人比他更快樂。
I've never seen anybody happier.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,120
哦，他要走了。
加油，加油。
Oh, he's going.
Go on, get on it.

188
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,080
- 逃跑！
- 恐怖！
- Run away!
- Horror!

189
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,399
一。
One.

190
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,279
- 一一一。
- 開始了。
- One, one, one.
- Here we go.

191
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,039
在方向盤上
他的藍色大分流器引擎，
At the wheel of
his big blue shunter engine,

192
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,919
詹姆斯推著我們的車，
警衛的貨車撞上了支線，
James pushed our cars and
the guard's van into a siding,

193
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,480
拆下貨車...
detached the car wagon...

194
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,440
那麼現在，前鋒。鬆開剎車。
So now, forwards. Release brake.

195
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,440
...然後重新連接
警衛的貨車到火車，
...and then reattached
the guard's van to the train,

196
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,320
其中，承擔了更多
各位乘客，再次出發吧。
which, having taken on more
passengers, set off again.

197
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,080
再見。
Au revoir.

198
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,519
-再見。
-再見，我的朋友。
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir, mes amis.

199
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,200
隨著夕陽西下，我們
然後不得不把我們的車從馬車上卸下來。
With the sun setting, we
then had to get our cars off the wagon.

200
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,360
這意味著啟動
Which meant firing up

201
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,159
車站非常
又舊又壞的伸縮臂叉裝機
the station's extremely
old and broken telehandler

202
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,639
並運用我的農耕技能。
and deploying my farming skills.

203
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,279
還有一點點……停下來。
Tiny bit more... stop.

204
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,399
這是我們第一次
曾經嘗試過正確地做某事嗎？
Is this the first time we've
ever tried to do something properly?

205
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,240
我們還沒有做到。
We haven't done it yet.

206
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,200
微小的
多一點。就是這樣。
Tiny
bit more. That's it.

207
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,879
然後我開始
檢索另外兩個。
I then set about
retrieving the other two.

208
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,480
我想你的車可能
比我重一點吧，詹姆斯。
I think your car might
be heavier than mine, James.

209
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,480
你下去吧。向下。
Down you go. Down.

210
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,135
等我清楚了再告訴我。
Tell me when I'm clear.

211
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:35,360
- 我想你沒事。
- 這樣就可以了
- I think you're all right.
- That'll do.

212
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
我們已經做到了。
We've done it.

213
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,000
我們都有了
三輛車進入毛裡塔尼亞。
We've got all
three cars into Mauritania.

214
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,759
第二天早上，之後
短暫而炎熱、不喝酒的睡眠，
The next morning, after
a short and hot, drink-free sleep,

215
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,679
我們聚集在一起
檢查我們的修改。
we assembled to
examine our modifications.

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,679
從我的捷豹 F-Type 開始。
Starting with my Jaguar F-Type.

217
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,320
我有點失望
如果我誠實的話。
I'm a bit disappointed
if I'm honest.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,360
還沒有解決
和我想像的一樣。
It hasn't worked out
quite how I imagined.

219
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,600
你想像了什麼？
What did you imagine?

220
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,000
嗯，你知道
在上世紀70年代和80年代，
Well, you know
in the 70s and 80s,

221
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,600
- 孩子們，當我說孩子們……我們。
- 我們。是的。
- kids, when I say kids... us.
- Us. Yeah.

222
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,399
你會買喇叭形輪
為您的護送拱門
You'd buy flared wheel
arches for your Escort

223
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,000
然後你就無力承擔
買足夠大的輪子來裝滿它們。
and then you couldn't afford to
buy big enough wheels to fill them.

224
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,759
是的，最終結果是
看起來很荒謬。
Yes, net result it
looks ridiculous.

225
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,519
當你繞到後面時...
When you come round the back...

226
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,480
大約是
後面18英尺寬。
It's roughly
18-feet-wide at the back.

227
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,480
如果我沒有打擾的話
與輪...
If I hadn't have bothered
with the wheel ar...

228
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,919
為什麼要加輪拱
在？你沒有輪子來填充它們。
Why put the wheel arches
on? You haven't got wheels to fill them.

229
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,639
儘管一切，
Despite everything,

230
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,600
它仍然是「Jaaaag」。
it's still a "Jaaaag".

231
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,855
- 那挺好的。
- 它實際上說的是「Jaaaag」。
- That's good.
- It actually says "Jaaaag".

232
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,159
我已經換徽章了
I've changed the badge.

233
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,360
你已經改變了「baaaadge」。
You've changed the "baaaadge".

234
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,735
然後我就有了
引擎蓋上的喇叭嘴
And then I've got
the horn bill on the bonnet

235
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,639
因為我已經舉起
空氣過濾起來。
coz I've lifted
the air filters up.

236
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,600
是的。
Yeah.

237
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,375
然後我就去了
Stratos 輕型背包。
Then I've gone for
the Stratos light pack.

238
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,480
你忙著解釋
你的醜寶寶，不是嗎？
You're busy explaining
your ugly baby, aren't you?

239
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,720
這些都是美學。
These are aesthetics.

240
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,639
是的，說到美學，
哈蒙德，你的處境非常非常如履薄冰。
Yes, and when it comes to aesthetics,
Hammond, you're on very, very thin ice.

241
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,296
- 其實你是。
- 稍等一下。
- You are actually.
- Hold on a moment.

242
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,039
不，沒有「堅持」
「那一刻」，你帶來了一輛地鐵出租車。
No, there is no 'hold on a
moment', you've brought a Metro cab.

243
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,535
你想知道它是什麼嗎？
Do you wanna know what it is?

244
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,080
這是一輛阿斯頓
馬丁DB9??，毀了。
It's an Aston
Martin DB9, ruined.

245
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,879
『毀滅者』是什麼
你應該稱呼它。
'The Ruined' is what
you should call it.

246
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,840
我的已經輕度損壞了
你的完全毀了。
Mine is mildly spoiled,
yours is totally ruined.

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,015
噪音，噪音，噪音。
Noise, noise, noise.

248
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,759
頭條新聞：這是一輛阿斯頓
馬丁，你可以住在裡面。
Headlines: It's an Aston
Martin you can live in.

249
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,559
那是一個帳篷，它
折疊起來，就是一座房子。
That is a tent, it
folds out, it's a house.

250
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,120
我住在1號，
阿斯頓·馬丁街。
I live at number 1,
Aston Martin Street.

251
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,936
- 那是一個帳篷？
- 那是一個帳篷。
- That's a tent?
- That's a tent.

252
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,919
這個很漂亮，看起來
像鯊魚一樣，看起來很隱秘。
This is beautiful, it looks
like a shark, it looks stealthy.

253
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,879
對不起...
Sorry...

254
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,600
它充滿了潛力和
這種潛力就是生活在其中。
It's filled with potential and
that potential is to live in it.

255
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,039
以及你為何給予
是碳纖維胸嗎？
And why have you given
it carbon fibre breasts?

256
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,495
因為我已經養了
前面的進氣口。
Because I've raised
the air intakes at the front.

257
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,096
哦，所以它是一樣的
我的喇叭帳安排。
Oh, so it's the same as
my horn bill arrangement.

258
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
是的，所以那就是
那在做什麼。
Yeah, so that's
what that's doing.

259
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,775
然後我提出了
暫停。
And then I've raised
the suspension.

260
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,015
- 你已經有了你的照明設備。
- 夠了。
- You've got your lighting rig.
- That's enough.

261
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,320
我們去看看我的車...
We will go and look at my car...

262
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,816
- 我不想談論你的車。
- 不，你知道。
- I don't want to talk about your car.
- No, you do.

263
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
- 不，我不。
- 這邊走。
- No I don't.
- This way.

264
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,120
做得好，
詹姆斯，這是毫無疑問的
Well done,
James, that is unquestionably

265
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,336
- 一輛好看的車。
- 確實如此。
- a good-looking car.
- It does.

266
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,015
你甚至已經
在上面放上漂亮的條紋。
You've even
put nice stripes on it.

267
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:07,840
我有。
I have.

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,840
我從來沒有
喜歡這輛車的外觀。
I've never
liked the look of this car.

269
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,480
但現在你做到了。
But now you do.

270
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,519
這實際上是改進了。
That actually is improved.

271
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,360
你在哪裡...怎麼了
你的空氣過濾器裝好了嗎？
Where's your... How have
you got your air filters up?

272
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,759
實際上
引擎蓋不同。
Actually the
bonnet is different.

273
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,759
這是一種
MC 閥蓋的復製品
This is a sort of
facsimile of the MC bonnet

274
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,919
如果你還記得
巨大的中置發動機超級跑車
if you remember the
gigantic mid-engine super car

275
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,200
它有額外的通風口
and it has extra vents in it

276
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,480
它那裡有一個插槽。
and it has a slot there.

277
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,655
這就像聖誕節的早晨
你得到了比我更好的禮物。
This is like Christmas morning
and you got a better present than me.

278
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,720
我感覺不太好。
I don't feel very good.

279
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,879
就是這樣。
It's exactly what it is.

280
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,639
我很生氣你的車
看起來比我的車好。
I'm so cross that your car
looks better than my car.

281
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,320
- 嗯，當然可以。
- 它看起來和我的一樣好。
- Well, of course it does.
- It looks damn near as good as mine.

282
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,000
- 防滾架是怎麼回事？
- 萬一翻車了。
- And what's with the roll cage?
- In case it rolls over.

283
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,759
哦，堅持住。
Oh, hang on.

284
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
啊哈！
Aha!

285
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,840
這裡是...
Here it is...

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,720
- 文本。
- 威爾曼先生發來的短信。
- Text.
- Text from Mr Wilman.

287
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,879
繼續。
Go on.

288
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,960
「你開車穿過沙漠
過去是這樣，但這一次是最重要的，
"You have driven across deserts
in the past, but this is the big one,

289
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,039
「這裡是撒哈拉沙漠，
世界上最大的沙漠。
"this is the Sahara, the
biggest desert in the world.

290
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,320
「你現在要開車
跨越一千英里
"And you will now drive
across it for a thousand miles

291
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,119
「去塞內加爾的海灘
巴黎-達喀爾曾經是終點站。」
"to the beach in Senegal where
the Paris-Dakar used to finish."

292
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,079
等一下，我們是
參加巴黎達喀爾比賽嗎？
Wait a minute, we are
doing the Paris-Dakar?

293
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
我們是...這是
男孩自己的夢想。
We are... This is
boy's own dream.

294
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,559
其實比那更好
It's actually better than that,

295
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,640
因為我們不必這樣做
來自巴黎的無聊事，我們只是在做……
because we don't have to do the
boring bit from Paris, we're just doing...

296
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
荒漠令人興奮
你想做的事。
The deserty exciting
bits you want to do.

297
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,775
- 巴黎達喀爾賽的精彩片段。
- 這真是史詩般的。
- The best bits of the Paris-Dakar.
- That's quite epic.

298
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,799
——那是傳說。
- 先生們，先生們。
- That is legend.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

299
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,680
這可能有一些東西
為什麼巴黎達喀爾
This might have something
to do with why the Paris-Dakar

300
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,039
不再發生在
世界的這一部分，
no longer happens in
this part of the world,

301
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,319
因為還有更多。
because there's more.

302
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,079
「您目前處於
外交部紅區。
"You are currently in a
Foreign Office red zone.

303
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,000
「政府說
不能排除恐怖主義
"The government says
terrorism cannot be ruled out

304
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,400
「越過西部邊境
撒哈拉，正在發生一場小戰爭
"and over the border in Western
Sahara, there's a small war going on

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
「分離主義者之間
和摩洛哥人。
"between separatists
and the Moroccans.

306
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,079
「我們甚至不得不警告摩洛哥人
國防部關於我們在這裡的存在
"We've even had to warn the Moroccan
Defence Ministry about our presence here

307
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,400
「以防他們認為我們的乘員車輛
是攻擊力量和攻擊，
"in case they think our crew vehicles
are an assault force and attack,

308
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,799
「所以你要好好表現。」
"so behave yourselves."

309
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,559
有了這個
警告在我們耳邊響起，
With that
warning ringing in our ears,

310
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,079
我們啟動了引擎...
we fired up our engines...

311
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,680
只知道要到達喀爾，
我們必須繼續向西南方向行駛，
And knowing only that to get to Dakar,
we had to keep heading south-west,

312
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,640
陷入撒哈拉沙漠。
plunged into the Sahara.

313
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,400
450馬力，
450 horsepower,

314
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,319
開著阿斯頓參加達喀爾比賽。
doing the Dakar in an Aston.

315
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,440
儘管哈蒙德充滿熱情，
Despite Hammond's enthusiasm,

316
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,200
毫無疑問，我們的
汽車面臨著一項艱巨的任務。
there was no doubt that our
cars faced a daunting task.

317
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,279
因為他們真的
還沒有懷上
Because they really
hadn't been conceived

318
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,960
做這種事。
to do this kind of thing.

319
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,640
我們進行了輕微修改
超級名模奪得跆拳道冠軍。
We've brought lightly modified
supermodels to a kickboxing championship.

320
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,279
關於我的車的事
是的，它實際上開始了生命
Thing about my car
is, it actually started life

321
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,200
當瑪莎拉蒂
曾是法拉利的一部分，
when Maserati
was part of Ferrari,

322
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,920
但後來半途而廢
通過其發展，
but then halfway
through its development,

323
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,240
菲亞特擁有全部
很多，決定瑪莎拉蒂
Fiat, who owned the whole
lot, decided that Maserati

324
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
應該是阿爾法羅密歐的一部分。
should be part of Alfa Romeo.

325
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,559
於是瑪莎拉蒂開始了
再次使用
So Maserati started
again and used

326
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,880
一個切碎的
Quattroporte 來做這個。
a chopped-up
Quattroporte to make this.

327
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,519
F型
有點亂七八糟。
The F-Type
was a bit of a hotchpotch.

328
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,440
它開始於
XJ轎車的生活
It started out in
life as an XJ saloon

329
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,519
然後他們把它切掉
下來製作XK，
and then they cut it
down to make the XK,

330
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,720
然後他們把它砍下來
再次製作F-Type，
then they cut it down
again to make the F-Type,

331
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,640
所以這確實是一個削減
關上一關。
so it's really a cut and
shut of a cut and shut.

332
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,559
發動機有點
也弄亂了混雜
The engine's a bit of a
mangled up mishmash as well

333
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,039
因為他們想要一輛V6
because they wanted a V6

334
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,960
但無力開發
他們自己的，所以他們得到了他們的V8
but couldn't afford to develop
their own, so they got their V8

335
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,720
剛剛切碎
兩個氣缸。
and just chopped
two cylinders off it.

336
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,319
我們到了，V6。
And there we are, V6.

337
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,240
有用！我已經
說實話，確實如此。
It works! And I've
gotta be honest, it does.

338
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,960
尤其是擁有超級
充電器，您可以聽到。
Especially with a super
charger, which you can hear.

339
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,759
我的車實際上是這樣設計的
在捷豹設計中心
My car was actually styled
at Jaguar's design centre

340
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
在辦公室的一角
真的，在窗簾後面。
in a corner of the office
behind a curtain, genuinely.

341
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,920
然後就被放在一起了
使用相當多的福特零件。
And then it was put together
using quite a lot of Ford-based parts.

342
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,759
但它仍然是阿斯頓·馬丁，
But it is still an Aston Martin,

343
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,160
許多人認為這是
第一個真正的阿斯頓·馬丁
and many feel it's the
first proper Aston Martin

344
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,960
從舊的 DB 時代開始。
since the old DB days.

345
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,519
哦，衛星導航醒了。
Oh, sat-nav's woken up.

346
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,960
就在南邊
顯然是曼徹斯特。
Just south of
Manchester, apparently.

347
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
哦，看看這個。沙丘！
Ooh, look at this. Dunes!

348
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,319
正宗的撒哈拉。
Proper Sahara.

349
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,000
沙丘是出了名的危險。
Dunes are notoriously dangerous.

350
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,079
所以我們決定搞砸。
So we decided to muck about.

351
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,000
哦耶。我們不是流氓
英雄。我們是三王。
Oh, yeah. We are not the rogue
heroes. We are the three kings.

352
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,400
感謝我的 USB
連接性，我們有配樂。
And thanks to my USB
connectivity, we have a soundtrack.

Ah, don't cut the corners.

362
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,960
那裡有一個重要提示。
There's a top tip there.

363
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,759
不好了。不好了。
Oh no. Oh no.

364
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,839
我認為我的空調
剛剛收拾好行李。我真的認為確實如此。
I think my air-conditioning
just packed up. I genuinely think it did.

365
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,400
呵！哦。
Ho! Oh.

366
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,279
這是一個令人難以置信的腐爛
有點運氣。我的正在工作。
That is an unbelievably rotten
bit of luck. Mine's working.

367
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,039
是什麼
那裡的溫度？
What is the
temperature out there?

368
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,440
48度。
48 degrees.

369
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,680
天啊。
Holy cow.

370
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,359
嗯...
Um...

371
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,519
發動機溫度高。
High engine temp.

372
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
停止。
Stop.

373
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,839
我的正在講述
我立即停止。
Mine is telling
me to stop immediately.

374
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,079
天哪。
Good God.

375
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,640
你好。
Hi.

376
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,799
啊。
Ah.

377
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:49,160
看起來有什麼麻煩，
先生？有一點麻煩，是嗎？
What seems to be the trouble,
sir? Having a spot of bother, are we?

378
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,720
很多都可以
以此解釋。
A lot of it can be
explained by that.

379
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,160
哦是的。
Oh, yes.

380
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,000
- 你那裡有什麼？
- 粉絲。
- What have you got there?
- A fan.

381
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
正確的。
Right.

382
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,839
來自彼得·瓊斯。
From Peter Jones.

383
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,119
真的停了
在那裡工作。
It really has stopped
working in there.

384
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,680
這就是我
想知道是不是腰帶丟了。
That's what I'm
wondering, if it's lost the belt.

385
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,559
- 那是什麼？
- 那是冷卻劑，
- What's that?
- That's coolant,

386
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,079
我懷疑，那就是
可能會從這裡出來。
I suspect, that's
probably come out of here.

387
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,839
而且很奇怪，因為
它說它是手工建造的。
And it's weird, cos
it says it's hand built.

388
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,359
- 是的，我想...
- 這意味著做得非常仔細。
- Yeah, I think...
- Which means done really carefully.

389
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,656
「手工打造
在英國。」
"Handbuilt
in England."

390
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,240
- 在英國手工製作。
- 那就是問題所在。
- Handbuilt in England.
- That's the problem.

391
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,936
- 這就是為什麼...
- 就在那裡。
- That's why...
- There it is.

392
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,519
事情仍然沒有解決。
It's still off the dial.

393
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,136
你不能只是坐在那裡。
你必須得到...
You can't just sit there.
You're going to have to get...

394
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,896
我將不得不讓
很酷，這就是我能做的。
I'm going to have to let
it cool, that's all I can do.

395
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,000
我不能碰任何東西。
I can't touch anything.

396
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,095
- 你必須把它修好。
- 為什麼你不能碰它？
- You've got to mend it.
- Why can't you touch it?

397
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,119
因為天氣很熱。
Because it's hot.

398
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,441
所以你要等它冷卻
下來，然後取出發動機。
So you wait for it to cool
down, then take the engine out.

399
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,240
永遠不會變涼
向下。49度。
It'll never cool
down. It's 49 degrees.

400
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,119
它就在
儀表頂部。
It's right at the
top of the gauge.

401
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,920
不不不。外部的
溫度。
No, no, no. External
temperature.

402
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,119
呃...
Uh...

403
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,720
63.
63.

404
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,456
- 什麼，那是華氏度？
- 華氏度，是的。
- What, that's Fahrenheit?
- Fahrenheit, yes.

405
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,176
- 嗯，這不是 60。
- 那是一個夏天...
- Well, it's not 60.
- That's a summer's...

406
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,400
這認為是在諾丁漢。
This thinks it's in Nottingham.

407
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,799
確實如此，看看。
It does, look.

408
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,160
63度
華氏度，在諾丁漢。
It's 63 degrees
Fahrenheit and it's in Nottingham.

409
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,880
它就是這麼想的。
That's what it thinks.

410
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,440
那麼，我們要做什麼？
So, what are we going to do?

411
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,799
鑒於哈蒙德
有房子有車
Given that Hammond
had a house and a car

412
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,440
相信它是在
東米德蘭茲在一個美好的春日，
which believed it was in the
East Midlands on a nice spring day,

413
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,240
我決定不這樣做
把我的扇子給他。
I decided not to
give him my fan.

414
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,799
然後我們就離開了。
And then we left.

415
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,759
好的，西特雷普。我們已經做了15分鐘
旅行和我們兩個人仍在移動。
OK, sitrep. We've done 15 minutes
of travel and two of us are still moving.

416
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,079
幸運的是，我工作了
很快就找出了問題所在。
Mercifully, I worked
out what was wrong quite quickly.

417
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,480
我以為的這種液體
來自發動機的冷卻液
This fluid that I thought
was coolant from the engine

418
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
已經煮沸的
過來並出來
that had boiled
over and come out

419
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,880
不是發動機冷卻液。
這是動力轉向液。
isn't engine coolant.
It's power steering fluid.

420
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,440
它是從那裡出來的。
It's come out of there.

421
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,360
那只是變得又熱又沸騰，因為
發動機艙裡太熱了。
That just got hot and boiled because
it was so hot in the engine bay.

422
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,279
我需要散熱。
I need to get heat out.

423
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,839
對了，威爾曼先生的備用貨車。
Right, Mr Wilman's backup van.

424
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
一定要有工具。
There must be tools.

425
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,599
哦。
Ooh.

426
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,720
真的嗎？天哪，我希望
我不需要那個。
Really? God, I hope
I don't need that.

427
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,880
哦，堅持住。工具？正確的。
Oh, hang on. Tools? Right.

428
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,720
哦。哦，這就是我的原因
疼痛。我比你更痛苦。
Oh. Oh, that's causing me
pain. It hurts me more than you.

429
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
那裡。
There.

430
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,759
請開始。
Please start.

431
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,200
是的。我已經給了你空氣。
Yes. And I've given you air.

432
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,119
還有另外一個
我可以做一些事情來幫助冷卻發動機，
There was one other
thing I could do to help cool the engine,

433
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,759
但這是難以想像的。
but it was unimaginable.

434
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,599
我不想這樣做。
我必須這麼做。
I don't want to do it.
I'm going to have to do it.

435
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,880
把暖氣調大，
Turn the heating up,

436
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,720
因為那實際上會很熱
空氣從發動機艙下方排出
because that will actually pull hot
air out from under the engine bay

437
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,440
並把它交給我。
and deliver it to me.

438
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
哦，是的，現在很熱。
Oh, yeah, that is hot now.

439
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,079
啊。
Argh.

440
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,559
前方，
Up ahead,

441
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,759
從那以後我就再沒有單獨感受到過這種感覺
詹姆斯和我開車去了北極。
I hadn't felt this alone since
James and I drove to the North Pole.

442
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,960
毛裡塔尼亞空無一人。
完全空了。看它。
Mauritania is empty.
Totally empty. Look at it.

443
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,400
沒有人來這裡。
No one comes here.

444
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,759
當我們拿到拍攝許可時，
When we got the filming permit,

445
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,279
是58號。
第58期拍攝許可證
it was number 58.
The 58th filming permit

446
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,200
這個國家有
自1960年起發行。
this country has
issued since 1960.

447
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,119
那是63年了。
That's 63 years.

448
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:40,039
他們只發出了
58張拍攝許可證。
They've only issued
58 filming permits.

449
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,519
哈蒙德，你回來了。
Hammond, you're back.

450
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,279
在引擎蓋上打孔
Made holes in the bonnet

451
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,039
我帶著加熱器跑步
在。我的壽命不多了。
and I'm running with the heater
on. I don't have long to live.

452
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,720
哦，我不喜歡那樣。
Ooh, I don't fancy that.

453
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,440
我們繼續前進
與我們的袋中煮同事
We continued onwards
with our boil-in-the-bag colleague

454
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,119
直到我們口渴為止
發動機需要汽油。
until our thirsty
engines needed petrol.

455
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,559
哪個，因為撒哈拉
沒有很多服務站，
Which, because the Sahara
doesn't have many service stations,

456
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,480
意思是靠邊停車加油
威爾曼先生提供的鮑澤。
meant pulling over at a fuel
bowser that Mr Wilman had provided.

457
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,680
你怎麼有
自己處於那種狀態？
How have you got
yourself in that state?

458
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,799
我們有……我們有安全帶標記。
We got... we got seat belt marks.

459
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,880
- 我在阿加。字面意思是阿加。
- 哦親愛的。
- I'm in an Aga. Literally an Aga.
- Oh dear.

460
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,559
- 我可以和你們兩個說句話嗎？
- 什麼？
- Can I just have a word with you two?
- What?

461
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,079
什麼？
What?

462
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,079
夥計們，在我們出發之前
威爾曼先生說，
Chaps, before we set
off, Mr Wilman said,

463
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,799
我們可以上演嗎，讓我們
誠實的、人為的事故？是的。
could we stage a, let's be
honest, contrived accident? Yeah.

464
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,599
油罐車爆炸的地方。
Where the fuel tanker blows up.

465
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,839
什麼？
The what?

466
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,520
因為他希望我們擁有
「哦，不，我們被困在沙漠裡了
Because he'll want us to have
"oh, no, we're stuck in the desert

467
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,960
「沒有燃料」恐慌。
"with no fuel" panics.

468
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,480
- 電視危險。
- 就這樣吧。
- TV jeopardy.
- There you go.

469
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,200
不，不，不，不，不。他想要爆炸
放入節目的預告片中。
No, no, no, no, no. He wants an explosion
to put in the trailer of the show.

470
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,359
- 啊對。
- 我對此投反對票。
- Oh, right.
- I'd vote no to that.

471
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,799
- 我也願意。
- 我會投反對票。
- I would as well.
- I'd vote no.

472
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:05,200
- 那是奶酪。
- 我不想把它炸毀。
- That's cheese.
- I don't want to blow it up.

473
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,119
- 而且他希望我們這樣做。
- 正確的。
- Plus he wants us to.
- Right.

474
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,559
所以讓我們照顧一下
這與我們的生活有關。
So let's look after
this with our lives.

475
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,279
這是最珍貴的
我們擁有的東西。
It's the most precious
thing we have.

476
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,720
對了，我吃飽了。可能？
Right, I'm full. May?

477
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,799
- 是的？
- 她是你的了。
- Yes?
- She's all yours.

478
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,055
詹姆斯，你要去哪裡？
James, where are you going?

479
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,119
我已經很長了
我們可以在這裡解決。
I'm getting a length on so
we can get it round here.

480
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,720
你能按一下按鈕嗎
到，嗯，它在下面嗎？
Could you press the button
to, um, it's down there?

481
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,856
- 有一點...
- 哦，是的，明白了。
- It's got a little...
- Oh, yeah, got it.

482
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,095
- 是的，它就在那裡。
- 在那。
- Yeah, it's there.
- It's there.

483
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,495
- 我們可以看到這一點。
- 它有一個汽油泵...
- We can see that.
- It's got a petrol pump on...

484
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,240
- 你能按一下嗎？
- 是的。
- Can you press it?
- Yeah.

485
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,400
- 還要別的嗎？
- 是的，你能按一下嗎？
- Anything else?
- Yeah, can you press it?

486
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,160
- 呃，我，是的，我，我...
- 請你按一下好嗎？
- Uh, I, yeah, I, I...
- Would you press it, please?

487
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,280
- 我已經做到了。
- 他確實按下了。
- I've done it.
- He did press it.

488
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,495
- 他沒有。
- 他做到了。
- He didn't.
- He did.

489
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,000
除了我之外。
Apart from I did.

490
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,880
- 你沒有。
- 我剛剛又按了一次。
- You didn't.
- I just pressed it again.

491
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,775
你能把
請打開點火開關並按下好嗎？
Could you turn the
ignition on and press it, please?

492
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,279
哦，這意味著兩件事。
Oh, that means two things.

493
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,359
就這樣吧。
There you go.

494
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,720
所以，他們是
非常好的指示。
So, they're
really good instructions.

495
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,400
- 噢！
- 我警告過你，詹姆斯。
- Ow!
- I warned you, James.

496
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,920
這是全城最火的事
It's the hottest thing in the...

497
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,920
噢！啊! 啊!
Ow! Ah! Ah!

498
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,880
已填滿
來自非常烤麵包的燃料鮑瑟，
Having filled up
from the very toasty fuel bowser,

499
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,440
我們繼續前進。
we moved on.

500
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,119
很快，我們遇到了
我們的第一個重大地質問題。
And pretty soon, we encountered
our first big geological problem.

501
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,200
兄弟們，我有點小
對此有點不安...
Chaps, I'm a little
bit unnerved by that...

502
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,200
無盡的懸崖面
endless cliff face

503
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,160
在我們前面。
in front of us.

504
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,480
我的意思是，有
看不到盡頭。
I mean, there is
no end in sight.

505
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,880
沒有盡頭
那座山脈的。
There is no end in sight
of that mountain range.

506
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,119
混蛋。
Bugger.

507
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,440
如果有人走了
費心製作這首歌，
If somebody's gone
to the bother of making this track,

508
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,079
他們不只是建造一條軌道
懸崖底部，會嗎？
they wouldn't just build a track to
the bottom of the cliff, would they?

509
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,079
很快，我們發現
弄清楚為什麼會有曲目。
Soon, we found
out why there was a track.

510
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,400
為什麼該死的地獄會
有人修建隧道
Why the bloody hell would
somebody build a tunnel

511
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,960
在中間
撒哈拉沙漠？
in the middle of
the Sahara Desert?

512
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,799
可能是一個礦井
為了一些可怕的事情。
Probably a mine
for something scary.

513
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,640
挖礦什麼？灰塵？
Mining what, though? Dust?

514
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,575
哈蒙德,
裡面不會有什麼可怕的。
Hammond,
there'll be nothing scary in it.

515
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,839
嘿！詹姆斯，我們可以
在這裡舉行比賽。
Hey! James, we could
have a race down here.

516
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,960
這是一個優秀的
我的想法，我不想參加。
That's an excellent
idea and I don't want to take part.

517
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,599
你不覺得
這是個好主意嗎？
Don't you think
that's a good idea?

518
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,240
誰能達到最高速度
然後在撞擊前剎車...
Who can reach the highest speed
and then brake before hitting...

519
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,759
哦，不，你不能那樣做。
Oh, no, you can't do that.

520
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,720
- 哦，該死，該死！夥計們，停下來。
- 為什麼？
- Oh, shit, shit! Guys, stop.
- Why?

521
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
他們是蝙蝠。
They're bats.

522
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,240
有很多蝙蝠。
出去。現在出去，大家都出去。
There's a lot of bats.
Out. Out now, everybody out.

523
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,960
蝙蝠並不危險。
Bats aren't dangerous.

524
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,735
蝙蝠不是……那是
只是...你想到的是史酷比。
Bats aren't... That's
just... You're thinking of Scooby-Doo.

525
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,295
- 你聽說過埃博拉病毒嗎？
- 是的。
- You've heard of Ebola?
- Yes.

526
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,640
你從你的身上流血
眼睛，你的鼻子，你所有的竅門，
You bleed from your
eyes, your nose, all your orifices,

527
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,160
- 他們全部。然後你就死得很快。
- 是的。
- all of them. And then you die quickly.
- Yes.

528
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,240
但時間剛好夠
你的家人來到你的床邊
But just enough time for
your family to get to your bedside

529
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,920
然後你爆炸了
用受感染的血液沐浴他們。
and then you explode,
showering them with infected blood.

530
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,640
大多數專家都認為它是有生命的
Most experts agree it lives

531
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,759
在西非的蝙蝠中。
in bats in West Africa.

532
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,079
我們在西非。
And we're in West Africa.

533
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,000
- 但我們現在有一個問題。
- 並不真地。我們不去隧道。
- But we now have a problem.
- Not really. We don't go in the tunnel.

534
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,720
嗯，不，我們有
去隧道裡。
Well, no, we have
to go in the tunnel.

535
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,359
我們必須進入隧道
我們必須開得非常快。
We have to go in the tunnel and
we have to drive incredibly quickly.

536
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,640
不，不是快得令人難以置信。
No, not incredibly quickly.

537
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,240
你會把事情搞砸的。
You'll kick stuff up.

538
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,960
可能是在蝙蝠中
鳥糞，你說嗎？
It could be in bat
guano, did you say?

539
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,079
- 可能是...是的，沒有人...
- 那是蝙蝠糞便。
- It could be... Yeah, nobody...
- That's bat poo.

540
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,799
是的，蝙蝠糞便。哪個
會在地板上。
Yeah, bat poo. Which
would be on the floor.

541
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,279
確切地。你會踢它
用你的輪子去...
Exactly. You'll kick it up
with your wheels by going...

542
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
一次一個。
快得令人難以置信。
One at a time.
Incredibly quickly.

543
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,480
對了，把車窗打開。
Right, windows up.

544
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,720
空氣再循環
所以它需要空氣
Air on recirculation
so it takes the air

545
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,119
在機艙中並發送
它回到機艙。
in the cabin and sends
it back into the cabin.

546
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,119
我不想要埃博拉病毒。
I don't want Ebola.

547
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,359
好的，我來了。
Right, here I go.

548
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,880
那挺好的。
文檔。文檔。
That's good.
Doucement. Doucement.

549
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,160
不！
No!

550
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,839
- 還有埃博拉病毒。
- 逃跑。
- And there's the Ebola.
- Run away.

551
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,760
哦，有一隻蝙蝠！
Oh, there's a bat!

552
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,720
一隻蝙蝠從窗戶飛過去了！
A bat went past the window!

553
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,559
我感染了埃博拉病毒！
I've got Ebola!

554
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,240
這該死的事情要持續多久？
How long is this bloody thing?

555
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,440
哦，這就結束了！
Oh, there's the end!

556
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,440
放鬆，放鬆，放鬆。
Relax, relax, relax.

557
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,920
噢，天啊！
Oh, Christ!

558
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
什麼...
What the...

559
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:32,480
該死的地獄
這一切都是關於什麼？
the bloody hell's
that all about?

560
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,856
- 進去。以合理的速度。
- 不要製造，不要踢
- Going in. At a sensible speed.
- Don't make, don't kick up

561
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,840
- 一堆灰塵。
- 我不會揚起灰塵。
- a load of dust.
- I'm not going to kick up dust.

562
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,599
拉屎。
Shit.

563
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,720
所以這就是邊界
與西撒哈拉。
So that's the border
with Western Sahara.

564
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,200
哈蒙德，哈蒙德，哈蒙德。
Hammond, Hammond, Hammond.

565
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,160
理查德·哈蒙德,
你能聽到我嗎？
Richard Hammond,
can you hear me?

566
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,640
哦，有
光，有光！
Oh, there's
light, there's light!

567
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,519
- 停下來，停下來，停下來！
- 該死的！
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Bloody hell!

568
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,799
啊啊！
Aaggh!

569
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,319
準確備份
你的輪子在哪裡。
Back up exactly
where your wheels are.

570
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,359
準確備份
你的輪子在哪裡。
Back up exactly
where your wheels are.

571
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,359
上面寫著「地雷」。
It says "mines".

572
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,240
是的，你正處於雷區。
Yes, you're in a minefield.

573
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,000
準確備份
你的輪子在哪裡，
Back up exactly
where your wheels are,

574
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
因為我們知道那裡
那裡沒有地雷。
'cause we know there
are no mines there.

575
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,799
你要開車
越過鐵絲網，
You're going to drive
over the barbed wire,

576
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,920
這可能會
給你刺一下，
which will probably
give you a puncture,

577
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,640
但是放鬆一點。
but relax on that.

578
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:53,960
正確的。
Right.

579
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,519
你很安全。
You're safe.

580
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,279
- 雷區。
- 我知道。
- Minefield.
- I know.

581
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,760
那就是西撒哈拉。
That is Western Sahara.

582
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,799
你覺得嗎
真的是雷區嗎？
Do you think it
really is a minefield?

583
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,840
好吧，這就是你的事情
一般採用標誌詞。
Well, it's the kind of thing you
generally take a sign's word for.

584
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,320
如果上面寫著「小心
毛毛蟲」,
If it said "Caution
caterpillars",

585
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,360
我想去看看。
I'd go and have a look.

586
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,119
但是，我的意思是，你只需要
掛個牌子，不是嗎？
But, I mean, you only need
to put the sign up, don't you?

587
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,559
是的，但你可能有
把地雷也放進去。
Yeah, but you might have
put the mines in as well.

588
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,800
是啊 但如果我是他們
我只是把標誌貼出來。
Yeah, but if I were them,
I'd just put the sign up.

589
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,039
- 你很懶而且沒有地雷。
- 是的。
- You're lazy and don't have any mines.
- Yes.

590
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,159
沒有，但在我心裡，有
那裡沒有地雷。
No, but in my mind, there
aren't any mines there.

591
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,519
- 我們去慢跑嗎？
- 不。
- Shall we go for a little jog?
- No.

592
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,119
到底是什麼...
What the hell is...

593
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,800
- 那是什麼？
- 這是一個雷區。
- What's that?
- It's a minefield.

594
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,320
- 雷區。
- 哈蒙德參與其中。
- A minefield.
- Hammond's been in it.

595
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,135
- 你參與過嗎？
- 他衝破了柵欄。
- You've been in it?
- He crashed through the fence.

596
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,760
我們現在遇到了問題。
We now had a problem.

597
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,519
擺在我們面前的是我們必須要做的事情
假設是一個真正的雷區。
In front of us was what we had to
assume was an actual minefield.

598
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,639
雖然我們身後有一個
隧道裡充滿了受感染的蝙蝠糞便。
While behind us was a
tunnel full of infected bat dung.

599
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,135
我不想回去
穿過埃博拉病毒的隧道。
I don't want to go back
through the tunnel of Ebola.

600
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:17,159
即使我們確實回到過去
那邊，有那個巨大的懸崖面。
And even if we do go back that
way, there's that massive cliff face.

601
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,400
是的，但這是一個問題
去嘗試並克服。
Yes, but that's a problem
to try and overcome.

602
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,159
那是東西
去嘗試解決。
That's something
to try and solve.

603
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,480
- 那不是。你無法解決它。
- 是的，所以，我們別無選擇。
- That isn't. You can't solve it.
- Yes, so, we have no choice.

604
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,159
- 這就是導航。
- 你說得對。你是絕對正確的。
- That's navigation.
- You're right. You're absolutely right.

605
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,440
我們沒有……我們不能……
We have no... We cannot...

606
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,480
- 停止！
- 不在雷區！
- Stop!
- Not in the minefield!

607
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,320
停止！
Stop!

608
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,055
- 停止！
- 停止！
- Stop!
- Stop!

609
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,015
威爾曼可能會得到他的拖車。
Wilman might get his trailer.

610
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,320
不，好吧，你打算
他站在這裡的時候？
No, well, are you gonna
stand here while he does?

611
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
不，我要後退。
No, I'm gonna back up.

612
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,519
油罐車
The fuel tanker

613
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,119
消失了
瞄準而不引爆。
disappeared out of
sight without detonating.

614
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,119
但事實並非如此
改變我們的想法。
But that didn't
change our minds.

615
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,360
所以，我們轉身......
So, we turned round...

616
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,320
然後就回去了
穿過隧道。
And went back
through the tunnel.

617
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,679
我們怎麼樣
會克服這個嗎？
How are we
going to get over that?

618
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,000
我不知道怎麼辦
我們會克服的。
I don't know how
we're going to get over.

619
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,199
幾個小時後，我們
最終找到了一條崎嶇的道路，
After many hours, we
eventually found a rough track,

620
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,920
看起來可能會發生
到懸崖頂部。
which looked like it might go
to the top of the escarpment.

621
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,880
哦，這有點顛簸。
Ooh, this is bumpy, this bit.

622
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,159
是的。
Yeah.

623
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,159
來吧，賈格。你可以這樣做。
Come on, Jag. You can do this.

624
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
這輛車其實是
讓我驚訝。
This car is actually
surprising me.

625
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,679
我想這是因為
它很輕，不是嗎，捷豹？
I suppose it's 'cause
it's light, isn't it, the Jag?

626
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,840
嗯，這使得
是的，差別很大。
Well, that makes
a huge difference, yeah.

627
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,159
我想我的可能重
現在超過兩噸。
I think mine probably weighs
more than two tonnes now.

628
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:54,880
快點。
Come on.

629
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,440
哦！
Oh!

630
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,800
哦。
Oh.

631
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,960
哦，該死的！
Oh, bloody hell!

632
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,440
天啊，加油！
God, come on!

633
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,119
胡說。
Bollocks.

634
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,320
他開著捷豹來了。
Here he comes, in the Jaguar.

635
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,119
你將會
撞到那塊大石頭。
You're going to
hit that big rock.

636
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,480
看那...
Behold the...

637
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,639
哦。
Oooh.

638
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,920
如果你能動一下並給我一個小小的
輕推一下，傑扎，那就太棒了。
If you can move and give me a tiny
nudge, Jezza, that would be brilliant.

639
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,159
瞪羚有
移動了海象。
The gazelle has
moved the walrus.

640
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
非常感謝。
Thank you very much.

641
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,840
來吧，輕輕地。是的是的。
Come on, gently. Yes, yes.

642
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,400
我開始
就像我的捷豹一樣。
I'm beginning to
rather like my Jaag.

643
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,880
抱歉，一開始我很失望
在其中，因為它太精彩了。
I'm sorry I was initially disappointed
in it, because it's bloody brilliant.

644
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,559
最終，我們
達到了我們的目標。
Eventually, we
achieved our objective.

645
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,880
嗯，這個
絕對是頂級的。
Well, this
is definitely the top.

646
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,639
我會說。
I'd say.

647
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,480
這似乎是
……那是一個建築工地。
And that appears to be
a... that's a building site.

648
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,079
那是我們的燃油車嗎？
Is that our fuel bowser?

649
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,760
他一定有
穿過那個雷區，不是嗎？
He must have got
through that minefield, mustn't he?

650
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,360
威爾曼先生會生氣的
Mr Wilman's going to be furious

651
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,639
因為它還沒有爆炸。他是
他的拖車一無所獲。
'cause it hasn't blown up. He's
got nothing for his trailer.

652
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,639
是啊，呃，夥計們，
我傾向於在這裡停下來。
Yeah, uh, chaps,
I'm inclined to stop here.

653
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,199
為什麼？
Why?

654
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,920
你會看到的。
You'll see.

655
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,519
- 呵呵，看！有一條路。
- 哦，是的。
- Ho-ho, look! There's a road.
- Ooh, yeah.

656
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,840
嗯，是的，有，
這是一條不錯的路，但是……
Well, yeah, there is,
and it is a nice road, but...

657
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,119
- 確切地。
- 它在下面。
- Exactly.
- It's down there.

658
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,679
它不加入
就到這裡吧？
It doesn't join
up with here, does it?

659
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
它與這裡沒有連接。
It's not connected to here.

660
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,400
- 我們會開車到這裡。
- 什麼？
- We'll drive down here.
- What?

661
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,976
- 我們會開車到這裡。
- 是的，沿著那條路走。
- We'll drive down here.
- Yeah, down that track.

662
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,159
這是懸崖！
It's a cliff!

663
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,159
重力太大了
立即可用
There's too much gravity
immediately available

664
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,440
我們之間
站著那條路。
between where we're
standing and that road.

665
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:15,519
這並不是一個殘酷的事情
不可預測的女主人。
And it isn't a cruel and
unpredictable mistress.

666
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,760
不，它非常可靠。
No, it's bloody reliable.

667
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,000
- 聽著，如果我先...
- 是的。
- Listen, if I go first...
- Yeah.

668
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,039
我準備這樣做...
Which I'm prepared to do...

669
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,800
- 真的嗎？
- 是的，我先走了。
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll go first.

670
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,440
備用貨車在那兒，是嗎？
The backup van's there, yes?

671
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,440
是的。
Yes.

672
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,440
就這樣綁定了
裡面有一些電纜。
That's bound
to have some cable in it.

673
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,599
為什麼我不附上我的車
到那些挖掘者之一？
Why don't I attach my car
to one of those diggers?

674
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,079
其實我們可以用
另一個作為滑輪。
Actually, we could use
the other one as a pulley.

675
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,599
然後我開車下來，
And then I drive down,

676
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,960
但我有
電纜的安全。
but I've got the
safety of the cable.

677
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,519
很多年前的某個時候，你
混淆了工程師和漫畫家。
Years ago, at some point, you
confused engineers with cartoonists.

678
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,559
這是什麼，非常非常非常
值得讚揚的是精心設計的自殺。
What this is, is a very, very, very
commendably elaborate suicide.

679
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,039
儘管如此，
沒有其他選擇，
Nevertheless,
there was no other choice,

680
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,119
所以我們去了
在備用貨車裡翻找。
so we went for a
rummage in the backup van.

681
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,920
這是一條合適的電纜。
That is a proper cable.

682
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,599
是否評級
四噸或五噸？
Is it rated
to four or five tonnes?

683
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
看起來是這樣。
Looks like it.

684
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,360
它會非常重。
It'll be incredibly heavy.

685
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,920
- 好吧，我們準備好了嗎？
- 腳。
- Right, are we ready?
- Feet.

686
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,199
開始了。
Here we go.

687
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,360
一旦我安裝好電纜
Once I'd rigged up the cables

688
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,639
完全沒有幫助
來自挖掘機司機，
with no help at all
from the digger drivers,

689
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,320
並付錢給他們的老闆......
and paid their boss...

690
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,639
一萬 MRU。
Ten thousand MRU's.

691
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,559
克拉克森勳爵。
Lord Clarkson.

692
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,760
我沒有支票
保修卡恐怕
I don't have a check
guarantee card, I'm afraid,

693
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,840
但沒關係，因為
我有一個「Jaaaag」。
but it's OK, because
I have a "Jaaaag".

694
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:36,880
然後我解釋了
將設置發送給我的同事。
I then explained
the setup to my colleagues.

695
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,920
- 那麼，我開車過去，是嗎？
- 是的。
- So, I drive over there, yeah?
- Yeah.

696
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,639
然後那個傢伙
挖掘機將向前行駛
And then the chap in that
digger is going to drive forwards

697
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,960
以相同的速度
我正開車下山。
at the same speed
I'm driving down the hill.

698
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,320
- 然後，那些滑輪。
- 是的。
- And then, those pulleys.
- Yes.

699
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,440
他可以擺動這隻手臂。
He can swing this arm.

700
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,840
所以，當我也許改變時
當我走下斜坡時的方向
So, as I perhaps change
direction as I go down the slope,

701
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,159
挑選一條路線，
picking out a route,

702
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,559
你需要告訴他
向右或向左擺動。所以...
you'll need to tell him to
swing it right or left. So...

703
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,336
- 他會說英語嗎？
- 什麼？
- Does he speak English?
- What?

704
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,376
- 他是不是...
- 不。
- Does he...
- No.

705
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,840
他們實際上都是毛裡塔尼亞人
但他們說阿拉伯語和法語。
They're all actually Mauritanian,
but they speak Arabic and French.

706
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,199
- 阿拉伯語？不，法語？
- 法語。我是你的男人。
- Arabic? No. French?
- French. I'm your man.

707
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:15,639
有我的後盾
整理好後，我爬上了船。
With my back-up
sorted, I climbed aboard.

708
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,559
你準備去嗎
掛檔還是空檔？
Are you going to go
down in gear or in neutral?

709
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,039
我得開車，
我不是嗎？我需要先進去。
I've got to drive,
haven't I? I need to be in first.

710
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,679
對了，我們準備好了嗎？
Right, are we ready?

711
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,480
站在我們身上，我們會看到
你說得對。你有我們的支持。
Stand on us, we'll see
you right. You have our support.

712
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,360
耶穌。
Jesus.

713
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,376
- 熊向左。
- 還剩一點點。
- Bear left.
- Little bit of left.

714
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,880
還剩一點點
Bit of left.

715
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,639
你很接近
到...你正在駛下懸崖。
You're very close
to the... you're driving off a cliff.

716
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,360
但好處是
是，由於我的 Stratos 聚光燈，
But the good thing
is, due to my Stratos spotlights,

717
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:48,159
我看不到這一點。
I can't see that.

718
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,679
好的。
OK.

719
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,519
我現在可以看到我擁有的東西
第一次要做。
I can now see what I've
got to do for the first time.

720
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,920
不喜歡這個。
Don't like this.

721
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,599
事實上，真的
不喜歡這個。
Actually, really
don't like this.

722
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,280
我需要向左走。
I need to go left.

723
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,960
如果你可以問他
向左擺動手臂。
If you can ask him
to swing his arm left.

724
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,320
將手臂向左擺動。在上面。
Swing his arm left. On it.

725
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,360
因為我不想
去那個溝壑下去。
'Cause I don't want
to go down that gully.

726
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,079
S'il vous pla?t，beaucoup...
S'il vous plaît, beaucoup...

727
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
左邊。
left.

728
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Droite。
Droite.

729
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,840
無論你
模仿，哈蒙德，還不錯。
Whatever you
mimed, Hammond, wasn't bad.

730
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:41,880
來吧，轉，轉，
轉身吧，你這個混蛋。
Come on, turn, turn,
turn, you bastard.

731
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:46,679
向左來，向左來。
Come left, come left.

732
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,840
向左走吧，我的小
汽車的山羊。
Come left, my little
mountain goat of a car.

733
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,360
- 這樣好多了。
- 全部伸直。
- That's better.
- All straightened.

734
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,199
天哪，我在做什麼？
Christ, what am I doing?

735
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,760
哦，呼呼呼。
Oooh, hoohoohoo.

736
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,039
我現在已經達到了一個地步
我想我可以走完剩下的路
I'd now reached a point where
I reckoned I could go the rest of the way

737
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,880
在我自己的推動下。
under my own steam.

738
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,840
這不是一個實用的日常
一種解決方案，是嗎？
It's not a practical, everyday
kind of solution, is it?

739
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,320
- 這並不快。
- 不。
- It's not quick.
- No.

740
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,400
- 你需要幾個備用挖掘機。
- 是的。
- And you need a couple of spare diggers.
- Yeah.

741
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
哦！
Oh!

742
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,400
好的，我開始了。
OK, here I go.

743
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:31,840
哦，上帝，說實話。
Ooh, God, struth.

744
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,679
我要往旁邊走
I'm going sideways.

745
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:39,519
理順了！
Straighten out!

746
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,159
好的。速度與力量！
OK. Speed and power!

747
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,119
我在路上！我在路上！
I'm on a road! I'm on a road!

748
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,960
哈蒙德和梅，現在輪到你了。
Hammond and May, your turn now.

749
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:05,039
這真的很容易，
一點也不可怕。
It's really easy,
not frightening at all.

750
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,880
在我們加入之前
不過，傑裡米，我們必須確保
Before we could join
Jeremy, though, we had to make sure

751
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,280
我們珍貴的九噸
油罐車安全降落。
that our precious nine-tonne
fuel tanker got down safely.

752
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,960
如果你必須降低
一艘油罐車衝下懸崖，
If you had to lower
a fuel tanker down a cliff,

753
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,480
哪兩個人會
你最不喜歡負責？
which two human beings would
you least like to be in charge?

754
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,280
我們是百分之一百萬嗎
確定這會安全嗎？
Are we one million percent
sure this is going to be safe?

755
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,880
不是一百萬
百分比，說實話。
Not a million
percent, to be honest.

756
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,119
這比捷豹重，
不過，即使有他在其中。
This is heavier than the Jag,
though, even with him in it.

757
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,639
對了，發下來吧。
Right, send it down.

758
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:52,599
- 不，這太多了。
- 太多了。退後一點。
- No, that's too much.
- Too much. Back a bit.

759
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:01,079
- 胡說八道！
- 哦親愛的。
- Bollocks!
- Oh, dear.

760
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:12,440
那聲音太可怕了。
That noise is horrible.

761
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,159
在中途點，
司機要求我們鬆開電纜
At the halfway point, the
driver asked us to release the cables

762
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,760
這樣他就可以完成剩下的事情
自己掉落的。
so he could do the rest
of the drop on his own.

763
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,199
好吧，我知道那是什麼感覺
就像那輛油罐車裡的那個人一樣。
OK, I know what it feels
like for that man in that fuel tanker.

764
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:38,119
底部鬆動。
Bottom loosening.

765
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,280
我認為我們需要一點
嚴重的左手向下
I think we need a bit of
serious left-hand down

766
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,976
如果他要避免
傑裡米遇到的問題，
if he's going to avoid the
problem that Jeremy had,

767
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,135
因為他不應該
那樣走得太遠了。
'cause he mustn't
go too far that way.

768
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,760
他需要開始行動
盡快離開。
He needs to start going
left as soon as he can.

769
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,800
詹姆斯，既然我們已經
又往山下移動了一點
James, now that we've
moved down the hill a bit further

770
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
- 第一次。
- 是的？
- for the first time.
- Yeah?

771
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,159
你看到了什麼嗎
我在那兒見過？
Have you seen what
I've seen over there?

772
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,519
哦，哦，哦，哦，哦，哦。
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

773
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,559
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

774
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,480
不好了。
Oh, no.

775
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,719
先生們，
燃油調節器已關閉。
Gentlemen,
the fuel bowser is down.

776
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,760
它被卡住了，但是已經下降了。
It's stuck, but it's down.

777
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,360
夥計們，好消息。
Guys, good news.

778
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:42,840
他已經快要跌到谷底了。
不會爆炸，這很好。
He's made it just about to the bottom.
It's not going to blow up, which is good.

779
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,719
還有前面
保險杠脫落了，
And the front
bumper has come off,

780
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:49,760
我認為這會起作用
和預告片中的東西一樣好。
which I think's going to work
quite well as something in the trailer.

781
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,400
那是
驚人的。這真的是真的...
That's
amazing. It's really, really...

782
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,920
這真是令人印象深刻。
That was proper impressive.

783
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,760
還有別的事。
Something else.

784
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,039
但是，我的意思是，這只是...而且
沒有爆炸，什麼都沒有。
But, I mean, it's just... And
it's no explosion, nothing.

785
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:03,920
- 你怎麼下來的？
- 哦，我們是在路上來的。
- How did you get down?
- Oh, we came on the road.

786
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:05,960
你是在告訴我...
Are you telling me...

787
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,495
我不打算
說謊。這真是一個驚喜。
I'm not going to
lie. It was quite a surprise.

788
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,320
就在建築工地後面。
It's behind the building site.

789
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,440
這就是為什麼他們有那些
挖掘機和那邊的東西。
That's why they've got those
diggers and things over there.

790
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,719
- 他們一直在修路。
- 他們剛剛到達山頂。
- They've been building a road.
- They've just got to the top.

791
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,239
- 這是一條很好的路。
- 很可愛。
- It's a nice road.
- It's lovely.

792
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,320
我們都在這裡。
大家都很高興。
We're all here.
Everybody's happy.

793
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:21,639
我不開心。我下來了
那裡。我從那兒下來，在那兒。
I'm not happy. I came down
there. I came down that, in that.

794
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,599
好吧。
Yes, well.

795
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,599
那很漂亮
簡單的。這是一條新路。
That was pretty
easy. It's a new road.

796
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,159
很可愛。新鮮的停機坪，
邊緣有一點沙子。
It's lovely. Fresh tarmac,
a little sand on the very edges.

797
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,119
隨著夕陽西下
和我們車輪下的停機坪，
With the sun setting
and tarmac beneath our wheels,

798
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,280
我們決定淘汰盡可能多的
天黑前盡可能走幾英里。
we decided to knock off as many
miles as possible before dark.

799
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:52,559
有一天我會承認，
天氣有點熱，但現在……
I'll admit that in the day,
it is a bit toasty warm, but now...

800
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,640
剛剛過了七點。
It's just gone seven o'clock.

801
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,159
太陽剛剛落山
在那兒的山??後面。
The sun has just gone
down behind the hill there.

802
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,639
這絕對是令人愉快的。
只有38度。
This is absolutely delightful.
A mere 38 degrees.

803
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,760
夜幕降臨，我們
把車停在路邊紮營，
As night fell, we
pulled off the road to make camp,

804
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:14,199
詹姆斯和我假設先生
威爾曼搭了一些豪華帳篷
with James and I assuming Mr
Wilman had put some luxury tents

805
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,320
在備用貨車中。
in the backup van.

806
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:22,599
我正在努力回憶
如果我曾經像這樣生氣過的話。
I'm trying to remember
if I've ever been as irritated as this.

807
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:25,440
實在是太窮了。
It's pretty poor.

808
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:28,559
這……就算是個男孩
偵察兵會對此說不。
This is... Even a boy
scout would say no to that.

809
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,440
他從哪裡得到它們？
Where's he got them from?

810
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,280
那天他去了格拉斯頓伯裡嗎
完成後就幫了自己？
Did he go to Glastonbury the day
after it finished and just helped himself?

811
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,039
但我不能...我的意思是，
我今年 63 歲了。
But I can't... I mean,
I'm 63 years old.

812
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,920
我幾乎無法觸及我的
膝蓋，別動我的腳趾。
I can barely touch my
knees, leave alone my toes.

813
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,599
他認為我會怎樣
早上就穿那件衣服嗎？
How does he think I'm going to
get dressed in that in the morning?

814
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,880
你知道嗎
什麼是雙重令人惱火的？
And do you know
what's doubly irritating?

815
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:47,920
不，但繼續吧。
No, but go on.

816
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,239
- 哈蒙德的帳篷更好。
- 好多了。
- Hammond's tent is better.
- It's much better.

817
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,015
我永遠不會去
能夠入睡
I'm never going
to be able to get to sleep

818
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:55,400
知道哈蒙德是
在 20 英尺之外享受更好的時光。
knowing that Hammond is
having a better time 20 feet away.

819
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,920
我不需要那樣的帳篷。
I do not need a tent like that.

820
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,239
分開後是半透明的
從其他任何事情。
It's translucent apart
from anything else.

821
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,159
他是否走進一家商店並
說：「最便宜的帳篷是什麼？」
Did he go into a shop and
say, "What is the cheapest tent?"

822
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,119
「什麼是
最便宜的帳篷？」
"What is
the cheapest tent?"

823
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,679
你知道超市是
聲稱回收他們的購物袋......？
You know supermarkets are
claiming to recycle their carrier bags...?

824
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:24,360
經歷了一個悲慘的夜晚之後，
After a wretched night,

825
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,360
我們曾向西南方向行駛過一次
更多地進入非洲的炎熱天氣。
we headed south-west once
more into the vast heat of Africa.

826
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,639
但從好的方面來看，
But on the plus side,

827
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
這條腿
旅程開始了
this leg of the
journey started out

828
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,639
作為汽油頭天堂的一部分。
as a slice of petrol head heaven.

829
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,159
首先，有一個
礫石拉力賽階段。
First, there was a
gravel rally stage.

830
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,519
然後，有什麼
感覺就像是阿爾卑斯山口。
And then, there was what
felt like an alpine pass.

831
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
哇，停機坪！
Whoa, tarmac!

832
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,920
耶穌！多麼好的一條路啊！
Jesus! What a road!

833
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,400
然後...
And then...

834
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,599
我們到達的表面
我們所有人都絕對討厭。
We hit a surface that
all of us absolutely hate.

835
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,639
天哪，這是洗衣板。
Oh God, it's washboard.

836
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,599
噢，有點糟糕。
Oh, bad bit.

837
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,239
啊哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈。
Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

838
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,159
讓它結束吧。
Let it end.

839
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,199
現在，求你了，我求求你了。
Now, please, I beg of you.

840
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,840
你可能不相信
這很糟糕，觀眾們，但是看看。
You might not believe
this is bad, viewers, but look.

841
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:42,559
我的一個通風口有
被從車上搖下來。
One of my air vents has
been shaken free of the car.

842
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,360
從我們坐的地方，
這是他遇到的最小的問題。
From where we were sitting,
that was the least of his problems.

843
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,559
詹姆斯，你的
瑪莎拉蒂看起來很搖搖欲墜。
James, your
Maserati looks very wobbly.

844
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,039
就像崩潰一樣
小丑車搖搖晃晃。
Like fall apart
clown car wobbly.

845
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:57,519
翅膀是
移動，一切。
The wings are
moving, everything.

846
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,199
天哪，我明白你的意思了。
Oh my God, I see what you mean.

847
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,719
整個身體都在顫抖。
The whole body is vibrating.

848
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,519
絕對是
這裡令人震驚。
It's absolutely
shocking in here.

849
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:08,920
你認為威爾曼先生會考慮把
備用貨車裡有一些備用骨盆嗎？
Do you think Mr Wilman thought to put
some spare pelvises in the backup van?

850
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,360
天啊。
Oh God.

851
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,039
我們已經做到了
其中42公里。
We have done
42 kilometres of this.

852
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,039
我厭倦了這條洗衣板路。
I'm sick of this washboard road.

853
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,960
幸運的是，
道路平坦的小鎮
Mercifully, a
town with smooth roads

854
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,159
很快就進入了視野。
soon hoved into view.

855
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,400
這座小鎮，欣蓋蒂，
This town, Chinguetti,

856
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,360
一千年前，而我
確實是指一千年前
a thousand years ago, and I
do mean a thousand years ago,

857
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,559
是之間的一個中轉站
廷巴克圖和海岸，
was a staging post between
Timbuktu and the coast,

858
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,440
他們存儲了所有
他們的文學在這裡。
and they stored all
their literature here.

859
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,639
每棟建築都是圖書館。
所有的學習都在這個小鎮裡。
Every building was a library.
All of learning was in this town.

860
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:04,960
今天，小鎮分裂了
被充滿軟沙的干河分成兩部分。
Today, the town is split
in two by a Wadi full of soft sand.

861
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:10,559
穿越它顯然需要一個
巨大的速度和力量。
And crossing it plainly required a
vast amount of speed and power.

862
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,840
聖哉耶穌！
Holy Jesus!

863
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,119
傑裡米來了。
Jeremy's here.

864
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:31,000
這是一個相當不錯的
小方塊，這個，不是嗎？
It's quite a nice
little square, this, isn't it?

865
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,320
我的車看起來有點...
現在看起來相當崎嶇。
My car's looking a little bit...
It looks quite rugged now.

866
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:35,559
這一切是什麼？
And what's all this?

867
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,119
啊! 我不知道。
Ah! I don't know.

868
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,480
哦天啊。
Oh geeeee.

869
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,280
哎呀，這樣不好。
Geee, that's not good.

870
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,719
本來就是這樣
在裡面的某個地方。
That's supposed
to be inside somewhere.

871
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:51,639
是油還是水？
還是油水？
Is it oil or water?
Or oily water?

872
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,575
- 沙質水、油水？
- 兩者都不是。
- Sandy, oily water?
- It's neither.

873
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,199
- 這是動力轉向液。
- 什麼？
- It's power steering fluid.
- What?

874
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,360
動力轉向液
變得異常炎熱
The power steering fluid
is getting incredibly hot

875
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,440
因為所有的工作
它正在做，還有熱量。
because of all the work
it's doing, and the heat.

876
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,840
你見過嗎？
Have you seen?

877
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,519
我可以看到
引擎蓋升起來了，我應該...
I can see the
bonnet's up, should I...

878
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,159
哦，這只是一個小...
只是溫度而已
Oh, it's just a minor...
it's just the temperature,

879
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,840
-這裡那裡有點太熱了。
- 它一直在哭。
- bit too much heat here and there.
- It's been crying.

880
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,559
是的，它有點哭泣。
Yeah, it has had a little weep.

881
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,719
嗯，這是眾所周知的事情
Um, it's a known thing

882
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,000
他們在沙漠中做到了這一點，DB9。
that they do it in the desert, DB9s.

883
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,679
- 聽。我想環視這個小鎮。
- 是的。
- Listen. I wanna look round this town.
- Yes.

884
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,736
我有東西我
想去這個小鎮看看。
I've got something I
want to look at in this town.

885
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,559
- 什麼？不，不，什麼？
- 這是一個圖書館。
- What? No, no, what?
- It's a library.

886
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:28,519
有很多圖書館。看，
「Bibliotheque」， 意思是圖書館。
There's lots of libraries. Look,
"Bibliotheque", that means library.

887
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:29,519
我想他們是三個。
There's three of them, I think.

888
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,840
曾經有什麼，
700？所有的知識，
There used to be what,
700? All of knowledge,

889
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,199
我是對的，不是嗎，漂亮
很多，都儲存在這裡。
I'm right, aren't I, pretty
much, was stored here.

890
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,159
所有阿拉伯知識，是的。
All of Arab knowledge, yes.

891
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,600
好的，我們會
一會兒見。
Right, we'll
see you in a minute.

892
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,599
我想要的原因
參觀這個歷史遺址
The reason why I wanted
to look around this historical site

893
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,440
因為很快，
它不會在這裡。
is because soon,
it won't be here.

894
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,360
沙漠是...
吃小鎮。
The desert is...
eating the town.

895
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,079
- 什麼？
- 它正在吃它。
- What?
- It's eating it.

896
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:07,079
血腥
地獄。看這個。
Bloody
hell. Look at this.

897
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,920
他不會去割草
他的草坪不再是了，是嗎？
He's not gonna be mowing
his lawn anymore, is he?

898
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,440
所以它有英尺深、米深。
So it's feet deep, metres deep.

899
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,239
- 為什麼沙漠正在吞噬城鎮？
- 看那個！
- Why is the desert eating the town?
- Look at that!

900
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,039
那麼現在，有一個
叫做全球變暖的事情。
Well now, there's a
thing called global warming.

901
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,440
聽說過。
Heard of that.

902
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,400
也正因為如此，
撒哈拉沙漠正在向南移動
And because of it, the
Sahara Desert is moving south

903
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,000
以四的速度
米一年。
at the rate of four
metres a year.

904
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,039
所以這就是風
移動沙子？
So this is what, wind
moving the sand?

905
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,400
是的，這只是...嗯，植被
正在死亡並變成沙漠。
Yes, it's just... Well, the vegetation
is dying and becoming desert.

906
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,119
- 百年，儘是沙漠。
- 走了。
- Hundred years, all that's desert.
- Gone.

907
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,639
這大概就是
房子的頂部。
That's probably
the top of a house.

908
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:46,840
血腥...
我對此感到震驚。
Bloody...
I'm staggered by this.

909
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,519
- 告訴你什麼吧，哈蒙德？
- 什麼？
- Tell you what though, Hammond?
- What?

910
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,079
它給了我一個想法。
It has given me an idea.

911
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,159
什麼？
What?

912
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,800
你會喜歡這個的。
You're gonna like this.

913
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,920
同時，
在其中一個圖書館中，
Meanwhile,
in one of the libraries,

914
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:06,400
有人向我展示了一些
令人難以置信的古代文本。
I was being shown some
incredible ancient texts.

915
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,159
確實用了黃金
在這一點上，這就是金子。
There's actual gold used
in this bit, this is gold.

916
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,280
是的。
Yeah.

917
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,960
是鍍金的。
It's gilded.

918
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,079
是的，就是這個。
Yeah, this one.

919
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,239
真是令人驚嘆，這個。
It is stunning, this one.

920
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,000
一位美國遊客說
Said that an American tourist

921
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,239
拜訪了圖書館裡的那個人
visited the guy in the library,

922
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,039
他問他
把書賣給他。
and he asked him
to sell him the book.

923
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,840
然後他告訴他
如果他願意賣掉它
Then he told him
if he would sell it,

924
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,840
他會給他一個房子
在佛羅里達州，他說不。
he's gonna give him a house
in Florida, and he said no.

925
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,480
這是他的遺產
曾祖父母。
It's the legacy of his
great-grandparents.

926
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:39,239
我認為你做了正確的事。
I think you did the right thing.

927
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,615
你不想要一個
佛羅里達州的房子。
You don't want a
house in Florida.

928
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,079
一切又熱又粘
到處都是持槍的人。
It's all hot and sticky and
full of people with guns.

929
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,199
我可以觸摸一個
500年前的天文學書？
Can I touch a
500-year-old astronomy book?

930
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,400
這是親戚
月球的運動和...
This is the relative
motions of the Moon and...

931
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,320
地球和太陽。
the Earth and the Sun.

932
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,519
這就是哥白尼之前的情況，
大概是在同一時間
So that's pre-Copernicus,
presumably, so it's about the same time,

933
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:04,000
在阿拉伯世界我不這麼認為
認為他們還沒有認識到
and in the Arab world I don't
think they had yet recognised

934
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,639
太陽應該是
考慮在中間。
that the Sun should be
considered in the middle.

935
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:09,679
還要記住
我們在這裡談論的是什麼
Bear in mind as well that
what we're talking about here,

936
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,639
11世紀，是我們的世紀
對11世紀的理解...
the 11th century, is our
understanding of the 11th century...

937
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,679
已發送
圖書館員進入深度睡眠，
Having sent the
librarians into a deep sleep,

938
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,320
詹姆斯終於出現了
到陽光下。
James finally emerged
into the sunlight.

939
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,400
嘿，怎麼樣
你在做？怎麼樣？好嗎？
Hey, how are
you doing? Was it good?

940
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,015
是的，那真是太棒了。
Yeah, it was bloody fantastic.

941
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:27,719
有很多書，但這本古老的書
關於先知生活的圖表，
Lots of books but this ancient one with
diagrams in about lives of the prophets,

942
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,400
每個人都是一個
插圖，就像一幅畫。
and every one was an
illustration, like a picture.

943
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:31,800
他的心情即將發生變化。
His mood is about to change.

944
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,000
你做了什麼？
你做了什麼？
What have you done?
What have you done?

945
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:35,816
好吧我們一直掛著
大約。我們走過來，
Well we've been hanging
around. We've walked about,

946
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,080
看看這個城鎮，不是嗎？
looked at the town, haven't we?

947
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,280
- 你已經注意到了。
- 哦這個？
- You've noticed.
- Oh that?

948
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,239
- 啊。那不是我們。
- 不。
- Ah. That wasn't us.
- No.

949
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,936
- 它是...
- 我們回來了
- It's...
- We got back

950
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,816
環顧四周
鎮上的其他地方...
from looking round this
other bit of the town...

951
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,320
- 是的。
- 並發現了這個。
- Yes.
- And found this.

952
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,776
你聽說過灰塵
魔鬼，那些像旋轉的風一樣的小東西？
You've heard of dust
devils, those little like spinning winds?

953
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,320
- 是的。
- 你停車的地方，在這個十字路口。
- Yes.
- Where you parked, at this intersection.

954
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,119
我認為它可能會被放大
風的影響
I think it maybe amplified
the effect of the wind

955
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,760
剛剛拿起它
並將其存放在那裡。
and just picked it up
and deposited it there.

956
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:01,960
你看到這發生了嗎？
And you saw this happen?

957
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:04,336
不，我們沒有，因為我們是
環視另一個城鎮。
No, we didn't, cos we were
looking round the other town.

958
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,639
唯一的另一個
我們能想到的事情
The only other
thing we can think of,

959
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,280
我們絞盡腦汁，是
他們這裡沒有門票，
we've wracked our brains, is
that they don't have tickets here,

960
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,280
如果你把車停在
大路中間。
if you park in the
middle of the road.

961
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:15,239
交通協管員簡單說
用沙子填滿你的車。
The traffic wardens simply
fill your car with sand.

962
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,119
這真是……太好了。
That's a... that's very good.

963
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,240
但如果我的車沒有怎麼辦
工作？我到底怎樣才能把它拿出來呢？
But what if my car doesn't
work? And how the hell do I get it out?

964
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:23,039
- 鑰匙在哪裡？
- 啊。
- Where's the key?
- Ah.

965
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,000
你把它留在哪裡了？
Where did you leave it?

966
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:25,655
在中控台上，
我總是把它放在哪裡。
On the centre console,
where I always leave it.

967
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:27,296
如果你只是打開
門一關，沙子就會掉出來。
If you just open the
doors, the sand'll fall out.

968
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,119
嗯，鎖了。
Well, it's locked.

969
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,400
你看，我從來不鎖車。
You see, I never lock my car.

970
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,840
以防萬一
確切的事情發生了。
Just in case this
exact thing happens.

971
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:35,320
好的，給我一個
鏟子，我去拿。你...
OK, give me a
shovel, I'll get it. You...

972
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:37,880
哦，那就滾吧。
Oh, bugger off then.

973
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,440
離開詹姆斯後
解決他奇怪的沙塵暴問題，
Having left James to
sort out his freak sandstorm issue,

974
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,320
我們前往備用貨車，
we headed for the backup van,

975
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,280
因為我們決定
解決問題
because we'd decided
to solve the problems

976
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,199
由可怕的事情造成
洗衣板路。
caused by the horrendous
washboard roads.

977
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,000
天啊，這是一個，這是一個……
Oh God, it's a, it's a...

978
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,719
哦，燃燒啊！
Oh, burning, ah!

979
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,119
啊! 謝謝。
Ah! Thank you.

980
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,480
如果你想做任何焊接。
If you wanna do any welding.

981
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:13,639
或者電鋸。
Or chainsawing.

982
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,800
或者角色扮演。
Or role play.

983
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,320
現在請稍等一下。
我可以用這些做點什麼。
Now hang on a minute.
I could do something with these.

984
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:21,760
我可以。
Yes, I can.

985
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,880
當詹姆斯
辛苦地清空他的車......
While James
toiled away emptying his car...

986
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,880
噢，愚蠢的。
Oh, stupid.

987
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,800
...我們很忙
我們在貨車裡發現的東西，
...we got busy with
what we'd found in the van,

988
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:40,199
很快我們的洗衣板
解決方案修改已準備就緒。
and soon our washboard
solution modifications were ready.

989
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,960
- 所以我在卡車裡發現了這個。
- 是的。
- So I found this in the truck.
- Yes.

990
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:45,679
- 這是一個修煉者。
- 這是。
- It's a cultivator.
- It is.

991
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:48,519
它可能會起作用，
It might work,

992
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,880
但一般耕種者
被拖在拖拉機後面。
but normally cultivators
are towed behind the tractor.

993
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:56,800
是的，但我得開車過去
道路崎嶇，方能修成平地。
Yes, but I'd have to drive over the
rough road before cultivating it level.

994
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,960
那是行不通的。
That wouldn't work.

995
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,719
不，這樣會更善於交際。
No, it would be more sociable.

996
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,920
我不是。
I'm not.

997
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,776
- 你不是什麼，善於交際？
- 善於交際。
- You're not what, sociable?
- Sociable.

998
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,719
我想要這個
工作並讓我的生活更美好。
I want this for me to
work and make my life better.

999
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,575
但我覺得
你會找到我的解決方案
But I think
you'll find my solution

1000
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,519
超過了這個
數百萬的係數。
surpasses this by a
factor of several million.

1001
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:13,559
我真的不知道
I've literally no idea

1002
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,599
為什麼威爾曼先生放了兩個
貨車裡的雪地摩托，
why Mr Wilman put two
snowmobiles in the van,

1003
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,400
知道我們要去
撒哈拉沙漠，但我很高興他做到了。
knowing we're going to the
Sahara Desert, but I'm glad he did.

1004
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,840
讓我解釋。好的。
Let me explain. OK.

1005
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,119
不用滑雪板，
我在前面裝了輪子
Instead of using the skis,
I've fitted wheels at the front,

1006
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,856
但我們並不是真的
對此感興趣。
but we're not really
interested in this.

1007
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,679
我們感興趣的
裡面是曲目。
What we are interested
in is the tracks.

1008
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,440
他們將會呼嘯而過
沿著我的車輪前行，
They're gonna be whizzing
along in front of my wheels,

1009
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,119
平滑山脊
smoothing out the ridges

1010
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,159
在洗衣板裡。
in the washboard.

1011
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,760
所以當我到達時，難以置信
光滑，就像檯球桌一樣。
So when I arrive, incredibly
smooth, it'll be like a billiard table.

1012
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,480
他們將會去
eeeee，就像兩個巨大的砂帶磨光機？
They're gonna be going
eeeee, like two massive belt sanders?

1013
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:52,119
是的。確切地
對，他們是砂帶磨光機，
Yes. Exactly
right, they're belt sanders,

1014
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,360
安裝在前面
捷豹F-Type的。
mounted to the front
of a Jaguar F-Type.

1015
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,079
- 是的。
- 越野捷豹。
- Yeah.
- Off road Jag.

1016
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,159
F-越野車類型。
An F-Off roader type.

1017
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,079
太不可思議了，不是嗎？
與其被關在單調的牢房裡，
It's incredible, isn't it?
Rather than be locked up in a drab cell,

1018
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:05,119
穿著一件夾克
做在後面，
in a jacket that
does up at the back,

1019
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,559
你有很多機會
讓你的瘋狂變得真實。
you've had so many opportunities
to make your insanity real.

1020
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:10,840
就在那裡！
There it is!

1021
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,639
隨著
技術簡報結束，
With the
technical briefings over,

1022
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,400
是時候放了
理論付諸實踐。
it was time to put
theory into practice.

1023
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
提升設備。
Raising rig.

1024
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,000
理查德
哈蒙德。走向未來。
Richard
Hammond. To the future.

1025
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:39,880
我猜
這個鎮上的大多數人
I'm guessing that
most of the people in this town

1026
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,000
還沒見過雪地摩托。
have not yet seen a snowmobile.

1027
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,199
他們會感到非常驚訝
聽聽它的主要目的是什麼。
They're going to be quite surprised
to hear what its primary purpose is.

1028
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,936
顯然，我有它
現在處於升高的位置。
Obviously, I have it
in a raised position right now.

1029
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,440
我可以通過液壓降低它。
I can hydraulically lower it.

1030
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,079
這就像詹姆斯一樣
邦德的蓮花。
It's just like James
Bond's Lotus.

1031
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,199
在普通汽車模式下，
這只是一輛普通的汽車。
In normal car mode,
it's just a normal car.

1032
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,639
一旦我們來到一個
鎮外的洗衣板路段，
Once we came to a
washboard section of road outside the town,

1033
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:08,880
我們準備了
我們的首次審判。
we prepared for
our maiden trial.

1034
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,599
雪地摩托正在行駛。
Snowmobiles are running.

1035
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:18,719
對了，我正在做
它。我正在做。
Right, I'm doing
it. I'm doing it.

1036
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,880
開始了。降低。
Here we go. Lowering.

1037
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,320
現在我們開始。
And here we go.

1038
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:38,760
天哪，我認為它正在發揮作用。
By Jove, I think it's working.

1039
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,639
我的意思是我...
I mean I...

1040
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,239
是的。
Yeah.

1041
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,000
我正在雕刻道路。
我正在撫平它們。
I am sculpting the roads.
I'm smoothing them.

1042
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,480
哈哈哈哈！
Ha ha ha ha!

1043
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,880
我正在平整道路。
I am grading the road.

1044
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:53,679
上帝！
God!

1045
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,000
無法相信
這件事正在發生。
Cannot believe
that this is happening.

1046
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,159
哦耶。
Oh yeah.

1047
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:18,559
我就坐著
現在就在這裡放鬆一下。
And I'll just sit
here now and relax.

1048
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:21,480
而且不只是我這樣
受益。請記住這一點。
And it's not just me that's
benefitting. Remember that.

1049
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,119
整個
非洲正在受益。
The whole of
Africa is benefitting.

1050
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,639
哦，石頭來了。看，
它正在踢起一些石頭。
Oh, stones are coming. See,
it's kicking up some stones.

1051
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,360
哦，是的，這可能會發生。
Oh yeah, that can happen.

1052
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
是的。
Yeah.

1053
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,880
哦，是的，那是一些大石頭。
Oh yeah, that's some big stones.

1054
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,760
但是儘管如此
這個初期問題，
But despite
this teething problem,

1055
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,920
當我們靠邊停車時
幾英里後檢查我們的工作，
when we pulled over a few
miles later to inspect our work,

1056
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,119
結果是毫無疑問的。
the results were unquestionable.

1057
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,480
你看向左邊
道路，這就是我們分級的道路，
You look on the left-hand side of the
road, which is what we have graded,

1058
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
那邊，
that side,

1059
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:59,960
然後看右邊
我們還沒有對道路進行分級，
and then look at the right-hand side
of the road, which we haven't graded,

1060
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,840
- 我的意思是...證明。
- 它有效，它有效。
- I mean it... proof.
- It works, it works.

1061
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,280
- 你可以用它來參加 F1 比賽。
- 哦，簡單。
- You could run an F1 race on that.
- Oh, easy.

1062
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,559
然後我們決定
完全具有公益精神，
We then decided
to be fully public spirited,

1063
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:16,519
並排行駛，所以我們
可以把所有的路都修平。
and drive side by side, so we
could smooth out all of the road.

1064
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:20,599
好吧，哈蒙德，我們走吧。
OK, Hammond, let's go.

1065
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,880
我們可以做雙車道。
We could do dual carriageways.

1066
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:26,480
我想我可以走了
這裡再深一點。
I reckon I can go
a bit deeper here.

1067
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,519
只是必須...我正在學習
現在就對系統進行巧妙處理。
Just gotta... I'm learning
to finesse the system now.

1068
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:34,239
拉屎！
Shit!

1069
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,760
媽的！
Oh shit!

1070
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,760
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

1071
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,159
我從未見過
任何類似的東西。
I've never seen
anything like it.

1072
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:56,519
我只看到一股煙霧
它跳過了那個東西然後……
I just saw a puff of smoke
and it leapt that thing and...

1073
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:00,440
至少沒有目擊者。
除了這輛卡車上的人。
At least there are no witnesses.
Apart from the people in this lorry.

1074
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,920
哦。
Ooh.

1075
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,320
- 我會靜靜地走下去。
- 是的。
- I'm just gonna quietly move along.
- Yeah.

1076
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,760
正確的。
Right.

1077
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,320
如果我並肩行駛，人們
不會發現少了一個。
If I drive alongside, people
won't spot that there's one missing.

1078
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,519
是的，哈蒙德思想很好。
Yeah, good thinking Hammond.

1079
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:20,119
嗯，那是獨一無二的。
我還蠻有信心的...
Well, that was unique.
I'm pretty confident...

1080
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,320
哦。
Oh.

1081
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:24,280
哦，我想它剛剛壞了。
Oh, I think it just broke.

1082
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,719
在第二次事件發生後，
我們決定放棄所有修路
After this second incident,
we decided to abandon all road mending

1083
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,199
在可預見的未來。
for the foreseeable future.

1084
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:41,360
最初，我們的實驗
太棒了，然後一切就都順利了
Initially, our experiment
was brilliant, and then everything went

1085
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:43,400
嚴重錯誤，嚴重錯誤……
terribly, badly wrong...

1086
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,039
確實很快。
very quickly indeed.

1087
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:46,920
你準備好了嗎
演講？我有過。
Had you prepared
speeches? I had.

1088
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,079
我不知道是否
我會獲得 CBE 或 OBE。
I didn't know whether
I'd get a CBE or an OBE.

1089
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:53,400
我本來要得到一個
雕像並做 TED 演講。
I was gonna get a
statue and do a TED talk.

1090
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:56,015
我可能是
現在也不會得到，
I'm probably
not gonna get either now,

1091
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:59,159
特別是如果我的雪地摩托
墜入偏遠村莊。
particularly if my snowmobile
crashes into a remote village.

1092
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:03,400
假設五月
最終會趕上，
Assuming May
would eventually catch up,

1093
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:05,639
我們決定繼續前進。
we decided to press on.

1094
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,239
但是，隨著夜幕降臨，我的
阿斯頓開始發揮。
But, as darkness fell, my
Aston began to play up.

1095
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,760
再次。
Again.

1096
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,840
呃，我又過熱了。
Er, I'm just overheating again.

1097
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:18,280
我被告知停止
立即開車。
I've been told to stop
immediately by the car.

1098
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,320
我似乎無法超越第三名
齒輪，因此它的轉速過高。
I can't seem to get past third
gear, so it's running at too high RPM.

1099
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,840
好的，哈蒙德。嗯，有
我對此無能為力。
OK, Hammond. Um, there's
literally nothing I can do about that.

1100
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:32,440
不，那是一個
嘆息，但你是對的。
No, that was a
sigh, but you're right.

1101
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,679
作為我同事的
尾燈融入夜色，
As my colleague's
taillights dissolved into the night,

1102
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,000
我被留下來
獨自前行……
I was left to
trundle on... alone.

1103
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:48,239
呃，已經很晚了，我不能走太多了
每小時超過20英里。
Er, it's late and I can't go much
more than 20 miles an hour.

1104
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,559
變速箱出現故障。不會的
上移。我被困在第二位了
The gearbox is failing. It won't
shift up. I'm stuck in second.

1105
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,320
如果我運行它高於
一千轉/分鐘，
And if I run it any higher than
one and a half thousand RPM,

1106
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,559
發動機過熱。
the engine overheats.

1107
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,920
我也收到警告
告訴我檢查電池關閉開關，
Also I'm getting warnings
telling me check battery off switch,

1108
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:07,079
剎車失靈，安全停車，我的
儀表板燈熄滅了。
brake failure, stop safely and my
dashboard lights have gone out.

1109
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:08,679
哦，他們回來了！
Oh, they've come back!

1110
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,840
SRS 安全氣囊維修緊急。
SRS airbag service urgent.

1111
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,960
側翻保護故障。
需要 DSC 服務。
Rollover protect fault.
DSC service required.

1112
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,039
快點。
Come on.

1113
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,760
會帶你去露營。
Gonna get you to camp.

1114
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,760
一點工作。
Bit of work.

1115
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,719
第二天早上，
詹姆斯和我重聚了。
The next morning,
James and I were reunited.

1116
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:43,119
天啊。
Oh God.

1117
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:44,760
哦。
Oh.

1118
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,360
哦，我是空的。
Oh I'm empty.

1119
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:58,199
- 早上，五月。
- 早晨。
- Morning, May.
- Morning.

1120
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:03,599
你見過嗎
這張照片缺少什麼？
Have you seen
what's missing from this picture?

1121
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,039
是的。
Yes.

1122
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,840
我排在另外兩個人後面。
他們領先幾英里。
I am behind the other two.
They're some miles ahead.

1123
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,280
我會找到他們，
I will find them,

1124
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,440
但我無法再繼續下去
直到我把這輛車整理好。
but I can't go on any further,
until I've sorted this car.

1125
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,679
所以我就在這裡跳過了
昨晚，因為我可以，
So I kipped here
last night, cos I can,

1126
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,800
因為我有一個
阿斯頓·馬丁酒店。
cos I've got an
Aston Martin hotel.

1127
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,880
但阿斯頓·馬丁
位工作得不太好。
But the Aston Martin
bit isn't working very well.

1128
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,840
我負責推出這輛車。我
記得他們出來的時候。
I did the launch of this car. I
remember when they came out.

1129
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,719
這是從確切的時間點開始
汽車開始變得越來越聰明。
It's from the exact point when
cars started getting cleverer.

1130
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,119
但還不夠聰明。
But not clever enough.

1131
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,920
通常情況下，一切都是電動的
汽車由一根單獨的電線控制，
Normally everything electric on a
car was controlled by a separate wire,

1132
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,320
當所有的時候這都可以
你有一個喇叭。
which is OK when all
you had was a horn.

1133
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,280
但到了這個時候，一切
從事電子產品工作，
But by this time, everything
was worked with electronics,

1134
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,159
所以他們把它們全部結合起來
變成一根巨大的、非常聰明的電線
so they combined them all
into one gigantic, very clever wire

1135
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,055
繞著汽車轉了一圈
停在所有不同的事情上。
that went all the way round the car and
stopped off at all the different things.

1136
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,239
而汽車可以感知一切，
它的剎車，它的懸架，
And the car can feel everything,
its brakes, its suspension,

1137
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,599
這太棒了，直到
它感覺不到它們。
which is great, until
it can't feel them.

1138
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,320
所以如果它感覺不到變速箱
它停止使用變速箱。
So if it can't feel its gearbox,
it stops using its gearbox.

1139
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,495
某處有一個小
只是短路的東西，
Somewhere in there is one little
thing that's just shorting across,

1140
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:06,840
它正在發送其全部
中樞神經系統陷入崩潰。
and it's sending the whole of its
central nervous system into meltdown.

1141
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:10,039
它可能是
那裡的任何地方。
And it could be
anywhere in there.

1142
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:15,000
更糟糕的是沙漠。
很熱。充滿了石頭和沙子。
What's made it worse, is the desert.
It's hot. Full of stones and sand.

1143
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:16,359
天氣很熱，所以需要降溫。
It's hot, so it needs cooling.

1144
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,880
這是一個小散熱器
前面，小小的冷卻器。
Here is a little radiator at
the front, tiny little cooler.

1145
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,359
冷卻變速箱油，
就在後面。
That cools oil for the gearbox,
which is right at the back.

1146
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,439
其中一顆石頭已經消失了
穿過散熱器，並打了一個孔。
One of the stones has gone
through the radiator, and made a hole.

1147
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,039
這使得油洩漏出來
分佈在散熱器的前部，
That's allowed the oil to leak out and
spread over the front of the radiator,

1148
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:32,920
與沙子混合併
在自己面前築起一堵磚牆。
mingle with the sand and
build a brick wall in front of itself.

1149
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:34,960
所以變速箱過熱。
So the gearbox is overheating.

1150
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:38,760
我或許可以做點什麼
關於，但至於電子產品，
That I could probably do something
about, but as for the electronics,

1151
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,319
我只是要看看
I'm just gonna have to look

1152
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:44,159
直到我身體可以
找到一個問題來解決。
until I can physically
find a problem to mend.

1153
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,560
一個小時後
恢復體力後，我又上路了，
After an hour of
fettling, I got back on the road,

1154
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,760
但阿斯頓是
絕不是修補。
but the Aston was
by no means mended.

1155
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,920
我要搬家了，這很好。
但我只有一件裝備
I'm moving, which is good.
But I've only got one gear

1156
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,976
我不知道發生了什麼
到發動機或其他任何東西
and I've no idea what's happening
to the engine or anything else

1157
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,359
因為沒有我的
儀表正在工作。
cos none of my
gauges are working.

1158
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,640
溫度，沒什麼。
Temperature, nothing.

1159
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,800
這就是為什麼它不是
讓我換檔。
That's why it's not
letting me change gear.

1160
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,600
它沒有給我任何信息
因為它沒有得到任何信息。
It's not giving me any information
because it's not getting any information.

1161
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,199
哦你好。燃油鮑澤。
Oh, hello. The fuel bowser.

1162
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,640
好吧，我不知道我是否有
任何燃料，但無論如何我都會得到一些。
Well, I've no idea if I've got
any fuel, but I'll get some anyway.

1163
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,840
我的儀表不起作用。
My gauge doesn't work.

1164
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,079
- 哦，看。
- 他在這裡。
- Oh, look.
- Here he is.

1165
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:26,159
- 它正在工作！
- 是的。或多或少。
- It's working!
- Yes. More or less.

1166
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,560
我只是要讓它休息一下。
I'm just gonna give it a rest.

1167
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,335
- 你有多少個齒輪？
- 一。
- How many gears have you got?
- One.

1168
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:34,199
- 哪一個？
- 我不知道。
- Which one?
- I don't know.

1169
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,319
絕對的災難。
Absolute catastrophe.

1170
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:37,920
對了，加油。
Right, fuel.

1171
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,640
- 我不知道我是否需要它。
- 我沒有...
- I've no idea if I need it.
- I didn't have...

1172
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,320
- 你沒有撥號盤。
- 我什麼都沒有！
- You've no dials.
- I've got nothing!

1173
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,159
它也這樣做。我
不知道那是什麼。
It does that as well. I
don't know what that is.

1174
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,880
你從未聽過邦德的阿斯頓
聽起來是這樣，是嗎？
You never heard Bond's Aston
sounding like that, did you?

1175
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:52,375
- 聽起來棒極了。
- 邦德，你開得有多快？
- Sounds brilliant.
- How fast were you going, Bond?

1176
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:56,319
「我不知道。Speedo 是
破碎的。我只有一件裝備。」
"I don't know. Speedo were
broken. I only had one gear."

1177
01:09:58,119 --> 01:09:59,520
- 你知道什麼嗎？
- 什麼？
- Do you know what?
- What?

1178
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:01,880
- 我們已經在這裡三天了。
- 是的。
- We've been here three days.
- Yeah.

1179
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,399
- 我一定喝了 60 升水。
- 簡單的。
- I must have drunk 60 litres of water.
- Easy.

1180
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,439
我一次都沒尿過，現在
我認為這鼓勵了它。
I haven't peed once and now
I think this has encouraged it.

1181
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,119
我能感覺到有人來了。
我要去砍一刀。
I can feel one coming.
I'm gonna go for a slash.

1182
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:16,119
- 我還沒尿過
- 不，不需要！
- I haven't had a pee.
- No, don't need it!

1183
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:19,279
嗯，太陽已經沸騰了
這一切都出自我們之手。但...
Well, the sun has boiled
it all out of us. But...

1184
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,920
但它實際上...不，真的，
自從我來到這裡之後，我還沒有尿過尿。
But it's actually got... No, genuinely,
I haven't had a pee since I got here.

1185
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:25,920
去喝一杯吧。
Go and have one.

1186
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:28,079
我會嘗試，因為
有一陣子了。
I'm gonna try, because
it's been a while.

1187
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,359
我絕對還是
不想要一個。
I definitely still
don't want one.

1188
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,119
幾分鐘後
就任該職位，
After a few minutes
of assuming the position,

1189
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:37,880
我們終於有了一些
有點成功。
we finally had some
sort of success.

1190
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,736
你知道你得到了那些圖表
告訴你小便的顏色。
You know you get those charts
that tell you the colour of your pee.

1191
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,920
- 它告訴您您的健康狀況。
- 是的。
- It tells you how healthy you are.
- Yeah.

1192
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,159
該顏色不在該圖表上。
This colour's not on that chart.

1193
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,359
這只是一股細細的熱流
沙子從吸管裡掉下來。
This is just a thin stream of hot
sand falling through a milk straw.

1194
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:55,279
我的就像樓梯欄杆。
Mine's like a stair banister.

1195
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:57,720
我其實可以拉它，
它製成了太妃糖。
I could actually pull it,
and it's made a toffee.

1196
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:01,199
可能會這樣做
再過一周。
Might do that
again in another week.

1197
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,760
啊! 我的座位太熱了。
Ah! My seat is so hot.

1198
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,359
點火開關打開。儀表板關閉。
Ignition on. Dashboard off.

1199
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,039
那是有效的。
That is working.

1200
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:11,760
我有驅動嗎？
Do I have drive?

1201
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,800
不，是的，我願意。
No, yes, I do.

1202
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,816
- 那是什麼？
- 什麼……？什麼？
- What was that?
- What the...? What?

1203
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,600
這是什麼東西？
What the hell was that?

1204
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:29,000
什麼？為什麼會……？
What? Why would it...?

1205
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:36,720
為什麼你
把它綁在燃油弓上？
Why did you
tie it to the fuel bowser?

1206
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:40,680
你和我當時...
You and I were...

1207
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,840
可能。
May.

1208
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,520
- 你做了這個了嗎？
- 什麼？
- Did you do this?
- What?

1209
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:47,920
好吧，有人綁了
它到燃料庫。
Well, somebody tied
it to the fuel bowser.

1210
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,760
如果燃油怎麼辦
鮑澤爆炸了？
What if the fuel
bowser had blown up?

1211
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,359
哦，我知道那是什麼。
Oh, I know what that is.

1212
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,640
詭異的氣象
條件可能會混亂
The freaky meteorological
conditions can tangle up

1213
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,920
一點零散的帶子吹動
周圍，??並將其綁在東西上。
a stray bit of strop blowing
around, and tie it onto things.

1214
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,239
那是我的家。
That's my home.

1215
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,520
我無法把它裝回去。
I can't put it back on.

1216
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,199
- 因為它被砸碎了。
- 真是運氣太差了。我們走吧。
- Cos it's smashed.
- What a rotten bit of luck. Let's go.

1217
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:11,680
這意味著我們將有
看看阿斯頓·馬丁 DB9
That means we're going to have
to look at an Aston Martin DB9

1218
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,800
開車經過
沙漠而不是...
driving through
the desert and not...

1219
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,680
一輛地鐵出租車。
a Metrocab.

1220
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,696
- 這是工作場所的欺凌行為。
- 我沒有做！我當時正小便。
- This is bullying in the workplace.
- I didn't do it! I was having a piss.

1221
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,079
嗯，這不是小便。我曾是
從我的身體裡噴出一些羅洛斯。
Well, it wasn't a piss. I was
ejecting some Rolos from my body.

1222
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:27,680
那是一輛漂亮的車
你已經到了，哈蒙德。
That's a beautiful car
you've got there, Hammond.

1223
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,840
住口。
Shut up.

1224
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,039
今天我們的計劃是
抵達首都努瓦克肖特。
Today our plan was to
reach the capital city of Nouakchott.

1225
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,720
正如我們沒想到的
那會花費太長時間，
And as we didn't think
that would take too long,

1226
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,319
我建議了一個
文化轉移。
I suggested a
cultural diversion.

1227
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:54,039
我昨天正在跟嗯說話
圖書館外有一位老婦人，
I was talking yesterday to um,
an old woman outside that library,

1228
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:56,680
她說如果我們繼續
沿著這條路走下去，
and she said if we keep
going down this road,

1229
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,760
我們到達這個巨大的
沙漠中的眼睛。
we get to this enormous
eye in the desert.

1230
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:02,159
什麼？
What?

1231
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,319
顯然，它被稱為
非洲之眼。
Apparently, it's called
the Eye of Africa.

1232
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,079
這應該是
地球上最神奇的事情。
It's supposed to be the
most amazing thing on Earth.

1233
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:11,840
- 是嗎？
- 這是一個奇怪的地質事件。
- Is it?
- It's a weird geological event.

1234
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,279
但也有人說這是
失落之城亞特蘭蒂斯。
But some people say it's
the Lost City of Atlantis.

1235
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:17,840
這實際上是...
沒有人知道這件事
It was actually...
Nobody knew about it

1236
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:21,199
直到阿波羅宇航員
從太空看到的。
until the Apollo astronauts
saw it from space.

1237
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,840
真的嗎？
Really?

1238
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:27,119
我知道這聽起來難以置信
但她就是這麼說的。
I know it sounds implausible,
but that's what she said.

1239
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:30,039
她是否也嘗試過出售
你有魔豆嗎？
Did she also try and sell
you some magic beans?

1240
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,640
如果我們加快步伐，
If we pick up the pace a bit,

1241
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,640
我們有時間花
一會兒尋找它。
we'd have the time to spend
a little while looking for it.

1242
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,920
我無法接聽
步伐。我有一件裝備。
I can't pick up the
pace. I've got one gear.

1243
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:42,319
好吧，聽著，梅和我
可以組成先遣隊
Well, listen, May and I
can form an advance party

1244
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:43,880
通過撿起
節奏，好嗎？
by picking up
the pace, all right?

1245
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:45,719
當我們找到它時，
我們會給你響鈴。
And when we find it,
we'll give you a bell.

1246
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,399
如果你找到備用的
還有帳篷，我將不勝感激。
If you find a spare
tent as well, I'd be grateful.

1247
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,319
帶我到眼睛
非洲的。我來了！
Taking me to the Eye
of Africa. Here I come!

1248
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:15,560
那個超級充電器。
吃。吃燃料！
That super charger.
Eat. Eat fuel!

1249
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:21,600
裡面還有什麼
沙漠，還有巨大的眼睛？
What else is out there in the
desert, along with the gigantic eye?

1250
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,680
一個巨大的鼻子。
A massive nose.

1251
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:27,960
我知道有一對
那裡有巨大的山雀。
I know there's a pair
of huge tits out there.

1252
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:33,560
取得了良好的成績
在光滑的停機坪上取得進展，
Having made good
progress on the smooth tarmac,

1253
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,960
詹姆斯和我正接近
神秘之眼的位置。
James and I were nearing the
location of the mysterious eye.

1254
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,199
好吧，詹姆斯。如果
老婦人是可信的
OK, James. If the
old woman is to be believed

1255
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,000
巨大的眼睛就在這裡。
the gigantic eye is along here.

1256
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,239
沒有眼睛。
There isn't an eye.

1257
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,080
好吧，你不會的
說當你登上那座山時，
Well, you won't be
saying that when you crest that hill,

1258
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,000
並且有一個巨大的
眼睛在那裡。你只要看著就行了。
and there's an enormous
eye there. You just watch.

1259
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:10,319
向後退了好幾英里，
A good few miles back,

1260
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,920
我加入對方的機會
兩個人變得更苗條。
my chances of joining the other
two were becoming slimmer.

1261
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,119
對了，儀表剛剛來
簡短地說，這是個壞消息，
Right, gauges have just come
on briefly, and it's bad news,

1262
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:21,279
溫度確實很高。
temperature really high.

1263
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,319
我能做的就是
All I can do

1264
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:28,319
是按照音調所說的進行
我的一檔轉速為 2,000 RPM，
is proceed at what pitch tells
me is 2,000 RPM in my one gear,

1265
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,239
我可以停下來
並把我的屋頂蓋起來。
and I could do with stopping
and putting my roof up.

1266
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:35,039
我要停下來
宏偉的村莊廣場，
I'm gonna pull up in this
magnificent village square,

1267
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,840
因為我正在被煮熟。
because I'm being cooked.

1268
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:38,399
我屈服了。
I give in.

1269
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,199
他們可以用他們的
屋頂關閉。我不夠勇敢。
They can drive with their
roofs off. I'm not brave enough.

1270
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,119
請不要被卡住。
Please don't be stuck.

1271
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,800
天啊！
Oh God!

1272
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,880
不，這是不可接受的。
No, that's not acceptable.

1273
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:54,319
哦！
Ooh!

1274
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:56,319
天哪，我剛剛...
Christ, I've just...

1275
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,000
嗯...
Um...

1276
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:09,800
這就是翻車
在崩潰中部署。
That's the rollover
that deploys in a crash.

1277
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:12,960
那挺好的。
That's good.

1278
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:20,239
嗯，這樣的事不能再發生了
它可以？它消失了。就是看看……啊。
Well, it can't happen again,
can it? It's gone. It's just see... ah.

1279
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,720
嗯，我只是嘗試
啟動它，它，它......
Um, I just tried to
start it, and it's, it's...

1280
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:55,000
事情剛剛發生了很多
情況真的很快惡化！
Things just got a lot
worse really quickly!

1281
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,560
與此同時，在沙漠深處，
Meanwhile, deep in the desert,

1282
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,840
我們還沒找到
我們正在尋找什麼。
we still hadn't found
what we were looking for.

1283
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,920
沒有眼睛，沒有眼睛，沒有眼睛。
No eye, no eye, no eye.

1284
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,439
駱駝，駱駝
有眼睛，卻沒有眼睛。
Camels, camels'
eyes, but no eyes.

1285
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,960
基督，就是
可怕的噪音！
Christ, that is
a terrible noise!

1286
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:24,079
啊啊。
Aghh.

1287
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,520
這有什麼意義，
克拉克森？沒有巨大的眼球。
What is the point of this,
Clarkson? There is no giant eyeball.

1288
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,359
我們只是在破壞汽車。
We're just wrecking the cars.

1289
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,000
為了更堅持一點
我們可能會克服那裡的波峰，
For a bit more persevering
we might just get over that crest there,

1290
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,159
就在那裡。
and there it is.

1291
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:48,560
胡說！
Bollocks!

1292
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,279
公雞！
Cock!

1293
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,720
我被困住了，這是你的錯。
I'm stuck, and it's your fault.

1294
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,280
所有這些東西都是關於
從外太空看。
All this stuff about
seeing from outer space.

1295
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:00,295
想想這件事，
中國的長城，著名的
Think about the thing, the
Great Wall of China, famously

1296
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:01,760
「你可以看到
來自太空。」
"you can see that
from out of space."

1297
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,239
當你也可以看到它
你就站在它旁邊。
You can also see it when
you're standing next to it.

1298
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:07,720
它就在那裡。你只是，你
不會讓我去看看。
It is there. You just, you
won't let me go and have a look for it.

1299
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,399
或者它可能是一個
吉普賽玫瑰告訴你的童話，
Or it might have been a
fairytale that Gypsy Rose told you,

1300
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,199
因為你給了她 1.5 英鎊。
because you'd given her ￡1.50.

1301
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,536
好吧，好吧，
好吧，我會……我們會屈服的。
All right, all right,
fine, well I'll... we'll give in.

1302
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,520
我不喜歡屈服
但我會屈服。
I don't like giving in,
but I'm going to give in.

1303
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,255
是的，但你在給予
在尋找像眼睛這樣的東西時
Yeah, but you're giving
in looking for something like an eye

1304
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:22,600
在非洲中部。
in the middle of Africa.

1305
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,840
- 是的，這是一隻巨大的眼睛。
- 巨大，但是多大呢？
- Yes, it's a huge eye.
- Huge, but how huge?

1306
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:29,279
嗯，這就是她的方式
形容它像巨大的巨大。
Well, it's, the way she
described it, like massive huge.

1307
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:32,295
- 順便問一下，哈蒙德在哪裡？
- 這是個好問題。
- Where's Hammond, by the way?
- That is a good question.

1308
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:34,696
我假設他不是
懶得過來看看眼睛
I'm assuming he's not
bothered to coming to look at the eye

1309
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,840
因為他只是覺得……
cos he just thinks...

1310
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,520
好吧，我知道這可能是
毫無意義的練習，但讓我們...
OK, I know this is probably a
pointless exercise, but let's...

1311
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,239
根本沒有信號。
No signal at all.

1312
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,000
那是沒有幫助的。
That is of no help.

1313
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,736
沒有巨額金額
流出的液體，
There's no huge amounts
of fluid that've come out,

1314
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,279
但即使他們有，那也不會
解釋一下它只是死在鑰匙上。
but even if they had, that wouldn't
explain it just being dead at the key.

1315
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:07,800
明顯是電動的啊
It's clearly electrics.

1316
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:13,920
如果它2005年的大腦很虛弱
已經放棄了，我已經擁有了。
If its feeble 2005 brain
has given up, I've had it.

1317
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,760
唯一的另一件事，電池。
The only other thing, battery.

1318
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:24,279
那還沒有變平
它？但它就在這個座位後面。
That's not gone flat has
it? But it's behind this seat.

1319
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:30,359
哦親愛的主！救恩！
Oh dear Lord! Salvation!

1320
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,199
決不。不掛斷，
讓我檢查一下。
No way. Hang on,
let me just check.

1321
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,920
電池端子帶電
已經動搖了。
The live battery terminal
has shaken loose.

1322
01:19:42,359 --> 01:19:46,720
從字面上看，這已經動搖了
本身就被撤銷了。就是這樣。
Literally this has shaken
itself undone. It was like that.

1323
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,319
我走了，然後
還有更多好消息，
I got going, and
there was more good news,

1324
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,800
因為變速箱已經決定了
實際上再次成為變速箱。
because the gearbox had decided
to actually be a gearbox again.

1325
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,600
阿斯頓·馬丁！是啊哈哈哈！
Aston Martin! Yeah ha ha ha!

1326
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,279
我有齒輪和一切。
I've got gears, and everything.

1327
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,560
同時，在我們的
回到主路，
Meanwhile, on our
way back to the main road,

1328
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,399
梅和我相當
被我們發現的東西分散了注意力。
May and I had been rather
distracted by something we had found.

1329
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,800
這個。
This.

1330
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:37,960
- 該死的諾拉，看看這個！
- 你看！
- Bloody Nora, look at this!
- Hey, look!

1331
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,680
耶穌哭了！
Jesus wept!

1332
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,560
- 呵呵呵。
- 那是綠洲嗎？
- Ho ho ho ho.
- Is that an oasis?

1333
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,119
從字面上看沒有
證明我是英國人。
Literally no
evidence that I'm English.

1334
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,199
等待。
Wait.

1335
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,319
過來坐吧。我剛剛有
我們應該聽的事情。
Come and have a seat. I've got just
the thing we should be listening to.

1336
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:15,119
我找不到什麼值得紀念的東西
理查德·哈蒙德的去世。
I can't find anything to commemorate
the demise of Richard Hammond.

1337
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:19,199
你知道戈登·萊特富特
今天也死了。所以...
You know Gordon Lightfoot
also died today. So...

1338
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:20,560
- 他是嗎？
- 是的。
- Did he?
- Yeah.

1339
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,279

1348
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,720
只是為了給你一個
毛裡塔尼亞有多空虛的想法，
Just to give you an
idea of how empty Mauritania is,

1349
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:15,079
我現在已經做了一個
在此百英里，
I've now done a
hundred miles on this,

1350
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:17,680
主幹道的一側
一個國家對另一個國家來說，
the main road from one side
of the country to the other,

1351
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,920
我還沒有看到另一個
一輛車，沒有一輛車，什麼也沒有。
and I haven't seen another
car, not one, nothing.

1352
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:24,199
只是...
It's just...

1353
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,760
它傷害你的頭，
it hurts your head,

1354
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,199
這件事的嚴重性
地方，以及空虛。
the bigness of this
place, and the emptiness.

1355
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,520
我確實相信這是
一輛毀容的阿斯頓·馬丁。
I do believe it's
a disfigured Aston Martin.

1356
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,159
是的，確實如此。
Yes, it is.

1357
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,800
我的同事追上了我
My colleagues caught up with me

1358
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,880
就像我的鬧鬼汽車一樣
又開始播放了……
just as my haunted car
started to play up... again.

1359
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:50,439
我丟了變速箱。
I've lost gearbox.

1360
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:53,800
哦，現在它發出嘟嘟聲了！
Oh, now it's beeping!

1361
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:01,800
為什麼我的窗戶打開了？
Why have my windows opened?

1362
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,359
為什麼我的……誰……我沒問
他們。為什麼我的窗戶打開了？
Why have my... who... I didn't ask
them. Why have my windows opened?

1363
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,000
它主動不服從
現在還在折磨我。
It's actively disobeying
and tormenting me now.

1364
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:10,616
呃，決定
打開窗戶，
It's, uh, decided to
open the windows,

1365
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,720
並拿走
換檔能力，
and take away the
ability to change gear,

1366
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,000
伴隨著令人發狂的嘟嘟聲。
accompanied by a maddening beep.

1367
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,880
我認為
可能會發出蜂鳴聲
I thought the
beeping might be happening

1368
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:26,439
因為汽車不相信
我的屋頂已正確固定。
because the car didn't believe
my roof was secured properly.

1369
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,760
所以，我把車停在了路邊
來測試我的理論。
So, I pulled over
to test my theory.

1370
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,680
混蛋！
Bastard!

1371
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,560
還在響！
It's still beeping!

1372
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,696
它有一個非常方便的屋頂，你
只要按下按鈕，它就會下降，
It's got a very convenient roof, you
just press the button, and it goes down,

1373
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,319
然後你必須
出去跳上它。
and then you have to
get out and jump on it.

1374
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:53,119
他們確實說人們是
過了一會兒，他在沙漠裡發瘋了。
They do say that people are
driven mad in the desert after a while.

1375
01:23:55,399 --> 01:23:57,279
那麼在
中間？中間那一點。
What about in the
middle? The bit in the middle.

1376
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:02,199
這樣的一個yobbo。
Such a yobbo.

1377
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:07,159
別再發出嘟嘟聲了！
沒關係！
Just stop beeping!
It's all right!

1378
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:17,159
你說你認為
你可能處於二檔？
Did you say you thought
you might be in second gear?

1379
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,119
好吧，它不會告訴我什麼裝備
我參加了，但我認為這是第二位，是的。
Well, it won't tell me what gear
I'm in, but I think it's second, yes.

1380
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:26,079
但是如果我走得更快的話
過熱得非常快。
But if I go any faster, it
overheats very quickly.

1381
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:29,920
詹姆斯，我們再一次
我們面臨兩難的境地，不是嗎？
James, once again we
face a dilemma, don't we?

1382
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,560
我們一路驅車前往
以每小時 38 英里的速度滑行，
We drive all the way to the
coast at 38 miles an hour,

1383
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,079
或者...我們不。
or... we don't.

1384
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:39,840
讓我想想
那個有點。
Let me think about
that one for a bit.

1385
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,880
我已經來到了
同樣的結論。
I've come to the
same conclusion.

1386
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,800
絕對的混蛋。
Absolute bastards.

1387
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,520
還有
200英里去首都。
There were still
200 miles to go to the capital.

1388
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:04,319
所以詹姆斯和我把車停在了路邊
So James and I pulled over

1389
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,159
在一個小鎮去約會
與燃油弓。
in a small town to rendezvous
with the fuel bowser.

1390
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:13,439
我們得到了意想不到的獎金。
And we got an unexpected bonus.

1391
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,079
這是一條跑道。
This is a runway.

1392
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,760
是的。
Yes.

1393
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,239
我只是想也許...
I'm just thinking maybe...

1394
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,279
當我們等待哈蒙德時
while we're waiting for Hammond,

1395
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:31,359
我們可以做一些汽車
我們車裡的東西給我編程。
we could do some car
stuff in our car program me.

1396
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,399
- 你有什麼考慮？
- 嗯，我正在考慮一場短程加速賽。
- What do you have in mind?
- Well, I'm thinking of a drag race.

1397
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,760
哦，多好的主意啊。
Oh, what a good idea.

1398
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,696
那就相當了
有趣的是，如果你仔細想想。
It'd be quite
interesting, if you think about it.

1399
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,736
我一直想知道
事實上自從我們出發以來。
And I have wanted to know
actually since we set off.

1400
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,600
你的力量比
我有，你沒有嗎？你有...
You've got a lot more power than
I have, haven't you? You've got...

1401
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,000
我有更多的力量。我有
434，但我的體重更大了。
I've got more power. I've got
434, but I've got more weight.

1402
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:51,319
你有434馬力。我是
375. 這個有多重？
You're 434 horsepower. I'm
375. How much does this weigh?

1403
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,439
- 2噸。
- 因為我1.6歲。
- 2 tons.
- Cos I'm 1.6.

1404
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,439
- 那就相當...
- 有趣的...
- It'd be quite...
- Interesting...

1405
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,015
這將是一個有趣的實驗
女士們先生們。
It'd be an interesting experiment,
for the ladies and gentlemen.

1406
01:25:58,039 --> 01:25:59,039
是的。
Yes.

1407
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,600
所以，既然決定了，
我們駛向跑道盡頭，
And so, with that decided,
we headed to the end of the runway,

1408
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,319
豎起一些阻力
比賽用具，
erected some drag
race paraphernalia,

1409
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,239
並為出發做好準備。
and prepared for the off.

1410
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,600
對了，我該怎麼辦
需要？運動模式，
Right, what do I
need? Sport mode,

1411
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:14,800
是的！牽引力
控制，我想了想。
yes! Traction
control, I think off.

1412
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,800
我是手動的，但由於
我改裝這輛車的獨特方式，
I'm in manual, but due to the
unique way I've modified this car,

1413
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,840
我無法改變
任何程序。
I'm unable to change
any of the programs.

1414
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,520
嗯，由於獨特的方式
你把我的車裝滿了沙子
Well, due to the unique way
you filled my car with sand,

1415
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,359
我有一些麻煩
按鈕，但我現在已經拿到了。
I have some trouble with
the buttons, but I've got it now.

1416
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,279
等一下。你看誰在這兒啊。
Wait a minute. Look who's here.

1417
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,680
終結者
3：機器的崛起。
Terminator
3: Rise of the Machines.

1418
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,399
- 恰逢其時。
- 什麼？
- Just in time.
- What?

1419
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,199
- 恰逢其時。
- 做什麼的？
- Just in time.
- What for?

1420
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:40,520
飆車比賽。
Drag race.

1421
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:43,039
我並不是真的在一個
進行直線加速賽的位置。
I'm not really in a
position to do a drag race.

1422
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:45,319
- 把它關掉。
- 啊，不，不，不。
- Turn it off.
- Ah, no, no, no.

1423
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,199
那將是一個糟糕的舉動。
That would be a poor move.

1424
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:50,880
- 為什麼你不能把它關掉？
- 它可能永遠不會再開始。
- Why can't you turn it off?
- It probably will never start again.

1425
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:53,960
你知道我們正處於邊緣
開始一場非常緊張的飆車比賽？
You know we were on the verge
of starting a very tense drag race?

1426
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:56,159
你看過終結者3嗎？
Have you seen Terminator 3?

1427
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:58,399
人們不禁好奇
很多年了
People have wondered
for many years

1428
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,720
天網什麼時候
變得完全自我意識。
when would Skynet
become fully self-aware.

1429
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:07,119
駕駛阿斯頓·馬丁
在毛裡塔尼亞，沒有人預見到這一情況的發生。
In an Aston Martin being driven by you
in Mauritania, no one saw that coming.

1430
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:11,279
如果這個白癡學會了怎麼辦？
與其他機器通信。
What if this idiot learns to
communicate with other machines.

1431
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:14,680
- 這很愚蠢，不是嗎？
- 這是個白癡！
- It is moronic, isn't it?
- It's a moron!

1432
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,640
呃，哈蒙德，哈蒙德。
Uh, Hammond, Hammond.

1433
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,399
- 什麼？
- 那是什麼？
- What?
- What's that?

1434
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,399
到底是什麼鬼東西
是在這裡做的嗎？
What the bloody hell
is that doing here?

1435
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,856
- 那是你的一個嗎？
- 出色地...
- Is that one of yours?
- Well...

1436
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,360
- 你是什麼意思，我的一個？
- 還會有什麼？
- What do you mean, one of mine?
- What else is it going to be?

1437
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:34,479
- 已經過去多久了？
- 自從他放手以來。
- How long has it been going?
- Since he let it loose.

1438
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:38,560
- 那是150英里之外。天啊！
- 你把它釋放到沙漠裡了。
- That was 150 miles away. Oh Jesus!
- You released it into the desert.

1439
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,600
- 哦，你不...
- 那是什麼，這是...
- Oh, you don't...
- What that, it's...

1440
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:57,840
天啊！
Jeez!

1441
01:27:58,399 --> 01:27:59,560
噢。
Awww.

1442
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:07,399
- 那是你的錯。
- 什麼？
- That was your fault.
- What?

1443
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:09,375
嗯，這是你的雪地摩托。
他們不是撒哈拉沙漠中的其他人。
Well, it was your snowmobile.
They aren't any others in the Sahara.

1444
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:12,600
我不可能預測到
它會擊中燃油噴射器。
I can't possibly have predicted
that it would hit the fuel bowser.

1445
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,520
- 你釋放了它...
- 150 英里外。
- You released it...
- From 150 miles away.

1446
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,479
- 你把它放回野外了。
- 我沒有釋放它。它逃走了！
- You released it into the wild.
- I didn't release it. It escaped!

1447
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:22,159
- 我們被告知要守規矩。
- 是的。
- We were told to behave ourselves.
- Yes.

1448
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,920
我想我們應該離開了
I think we should depart.

1449
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,199
是的，我們該走了。嗯...
Yeah, we should go. Um...

1450
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,800
- 相當快？
- 是的。
- Fairly quickly?
- Yes.

1451
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,520
請換檔。立即換檔。
Please change gear. Change gear now.

1452
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,159
現在！現在是時候了。
現在是……現在是時候了。
Now! Now is the time.
It's... now is the time.

1453
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:43,920
別跟我爭論。現在
是時候換檔了！
Don't argue with me. Now
is the time to change gear!

1454
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,159
詹姆斯和我
以輕快的速度覆蓋地面，
James and I
covered ground at a brisk pace,

1455
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:54,199
放置盡可能多的距離
我們和爆炸之間
putting as much distance
between us and the explosion

1456
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:56,159
盡可能。
as possible.

1457
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:03,319
很快我們就被
我們周圍環境的荒涼之美。
And soon we became consumed by
the stark beauty of our surroundings.

1458
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,840
兩邊的景色，
尤其是那一面，更是蔚為壯觀。
The view on both sides,
especially that side, is spectacular.

1459
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,680
幾乎就像雪一樣
沙丘，沙子是那麼蒼白。
It's almost like snow
dunes, the sand is so pale.

1460
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:22,560
這是夢幻般的。
It's fantastic.

1461
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,600
我的體溫
已暴跌至 37。
My temperature
has plummeted to 37.

1462
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,880
哦，是的，我已經38歲了。
Oh yes, I'm down to 38.

1463
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,640
哇！這確實很冷。
Wow! That's positively chilly.

1464
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,439
最終，傑裡米
我到達了首都，
Eventually, Jeremy
and I arrived in the capital city,

1465
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,239
事情很快就變得清晰
where it soon became clear

1466
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,520
我們並不像
我們在世界其他地方。
that we aren't as well known as
we are in other parts of the world.

1467
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:11,159
理查德！
Richard!

1468
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,119
有人只是
叫我「理查德」。
Somebody just
called me "Richard."

1469
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:18,560
如果這個年輕人
想見見真正的理查德，
If the young man
wanted to see the real Richard,

1470
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,920
他會等很長時間，
he'd be waiting a long while,

1471
01:30:21,399 --> 01:30:24,920
考慮到哈蒙德和
終結者正在前進。
given how Hammond and
the Terminator were getting on.

1472
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:28,319
回來。工作吧，你這個混蛋。
Come back. Work, you twat.

1473
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,159
我們可不可以只...
好吧，這是你的變速箱。
Can we not just...
OK, it's your gearbox.

1474
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:35,319
我們能想到嗎
它作為我們的變速箱？
Can we think of
it as our gearbox?

1475
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:38,239
我們倆共用一個變速箱。
We both, we share a gearbox.

1476
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,039
中央
鎖定剛剛關閉。
The central
locking just went off.

1477
01:30:43,239 --> 01:30:46,520
它只是鎖上了門。
It just locked its doors.

1478
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,159
幾個小時後，
Several hours later,

1479
01:30:55,319 --> 01:30:59,600
天網推動了我的發展
齒輪車進入努瓦克肖特，
Skynet propelled my one
gear car into Nouakchott,

1480
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:02,600
哪裡有
無線網絡足夠好
where there was
good enough Wi-Fi

1481
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,760
讓我連接
汽車的大腦出現故障
for me to connect the
car's malfunctioning brain

1482
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,399
連接到診斷筆記本電腦。
to a diagnostic laptop.

1483
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,560
對，一檔行駛 200 英里。
Right, 200 miles on one gear.

1484
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,399
所以筆記本電腦，我用零與它交談
還有它能理解的語言。
So laptop, I'm talking to it in zeros
and ones, the language it understands.

1485
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,560
我現在要看看
它在恐慌什麼。
And I'm now going to see
what it's panicking about.

1486
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,600
令人擔心的是
很多。我的天啊！
It's worrying about
a lot. Oh my God!

1487
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,399
我是乘客門模型，
它正在擔心它的門。
I'm in passenger door model,
it's worrying about its door.

1488
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,600
擔心你的變速箱。
Worry about your gearbox.

1489
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:36,479
全球定位模塊，
這就是我來諾丁漢的原因。
Global positioning module,
that's why I was in Nottingham.

1490
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,840
我不相信大多數
這些都是機械故障。
I don't believe most of
these are mechanical faults.

1491
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,279
沒有出什麼問題。
它只是生氣了。
Nothing's gone wrong.
It's just got upset.

1492
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,680
如果我擊中這個，
If I hit this,

1493
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:49,760
這基本上是
「別擔心」按鈕。
this is basically the
"don't worry" button.

1494
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,920
我會去做的。
I'm going to do it.

1495
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:54,560
忘掉它。
它正在清除它們。
Forget about it.
It's clearing them.

1496
01:31:56,119 --> 01:32:00,640
請給我控制權
的車，讓我開車。
Please, give me control
of the car, and let me drive.

1497
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:04,279
所以，希望...
So, hopefully...

1498
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:05,800
沒法看。
Can't look.

1499
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:09,439
是的！就這樣吧！
Yeah! There you go!

1500
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,359
這沒什麼好抱怨的。
That's nothing to moan about.

1501
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:16,079
所以我想我已經有了齒輪。
So I think I've got gears.

1502
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,880
第二天早上，如
我們出發去城裡看看，
The next morning, as
we set off to look around town,

1503
01:32:57,079 --> 01:33:00,000
這是關鍵時刻。
it was the moment of truth.

1504
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,760
它改變了齒輪！它改變了
齒輪！它改變了齒輪！
It changed gear! It changed
gear! It changed gear!

1505
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,640
我有齒輪。它
剛剛換了檔。
I've got gears. It
just changed gear.

1506
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,319
所以，約翰·康納，
你正在反擊。
So, John Connor,
you're fighting back.

1507
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:14,359
哦，是的！
Oh yes!

1508
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:18,439
我們的目標是
去觀光，
Our aim was
to do a bit of sightseeing,

1509
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:21,399
但立即
我們分心了
but immediately
we got distracted

1510
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,279
因英雄的光輝
毛裡塔尼亞的汽車。
by the heroic brilliance
of Mauritania's cars.

1511
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,920
是的，暫停已經取消了。
Yes, the suspension's gone.

1512
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:35,720
他剛剛墜毀了。
他剛剛墜毀。
He's just crashed.
He just crashed.

1513
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,039
那聲音就是那個聲音嗎？
Is that what that noise was?

1514
01:33:37,239 --> 01:33:41,000
也許，對某些的一種解釋
這輛車發生的車禍
Maybe, one explanation for some of
the crashes that happened to this car

1515
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,159
事實是你
看不出來。
is the fact that you
can't see out of it.

1516
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:47,880
什麼時候，什麼時候
它不再是一輛車了嗎？
When, when does
it stop being a car?

1517
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,560
我想當它停止時
移動。到那時，它就是一輛車。
I suppose when it stops
moving. Until then, it's a car.

1518
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,000
我想有一天它會開車
亮起，然後就消失了。
I think one day it's driving
on, and just disappears.

1519
01:33:53,159 --> 01:33:54,199
呃。
Eww.

1520
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,720
哦，那不太好。
Oh, that wasn't good.

1521
01:33:56,199 --> 01:33:58,239
他要去
堅持下去，他會繼續前進。
He's going to
keep, he's gonna keep going.

1522
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,640
極好的。
Fantastic.

1523
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,359
他無法停下來。那
那傢伙必須抓住門。
He can't stop. That
bloke got to hang on to the door.

1524
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,040
- 另一個。
- 是的。
- Another one.
- Yes.

1525
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,960
我喜歡
行人安全功能。
I like the
pedestrian safety feature.

1526
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:08,840
但它正在發揮作用！它是...
But it's working! It's...

1527
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:12,159
你擔心的哈蒙德
你的阿斯頓，說實話......
Hammond you worried about
your Aston, and honestly...

1528
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,976
好吧，這就是為什麼我不能
鬧騰不是嗎？
Well, that's why I can't
make a fuss, isn't it?

1529
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,199
我的意思是，我只
有點開始了。
I mean, I've only
kind of started.

1530
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,800
已經搭好
這些毛裡塔尼亞戰馬，
Having lapped up
these Mauritanian war horses,

1531
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,720
我們決定去
去咖啡館喝一杯......
we decided to go
to a cafe for a drink...

1532
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:27,600
熱棕色水。
of hot brown water.

1533
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:31,079
MOT 測試的作用是什麼
我想知道中心看起來像這裡。
What does an MOT testing
centre look like here I wonder.

1534
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:33,199
無形的。
啊! 一輛奔馳。
Invisible.
Ah! A Mercedes.

1535
01:34:33,399 --> 01:34:35,960
瞧，每一個
面板，不止一次。
Look, every
panel, more than once.

1536
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:37,199
不只一次。
Not just once.

1537
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:39,680
哦耶，
這是一生的工作。
Oh yeah,
that's a lifetime's work.

1538
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,840
約翰，你的車怎麼樣了，
還是天網仍然獲勝？
And, John, how's your car,
or is Skynet still winning?

1539
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,439
我正在與之鬥爭，並且
它正在反擊。
I'm fighting it, and
it's fighting back.

1540
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,119
有沒有說：「是
你是莎拉·康納嗎？」
Has it said, "Are
you Sarah Connor?"

1541
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:53,760
我想知道我是否可以註冊成為
博格的一部分，並直接與它戰鬥。
I'm wondering if I can sign up to be
part of the Borg, and fight it directly.

1542
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:56,760
那是一塊餅乾！
That is a cracker!

1543
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,760
看那個。
Look at that.

1544
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,415
- 很棒的一個，看看那個。
- 那很好。
- Great one, look at that one.
- That's nice.

1545
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:02,119
他在巡航，
將手臂伸出窗外。
He's cruising,
arm out the window.

1546
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,680
雖然不是茶，但也很好喝
甚至你也會說這很好。
That isn't tea, but it is quite nice,
and even you will say it's quite nice.

1547
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,840
裡面可能有一些茶。
It might have some tea in it.

1548
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:12,800
- 我寧願喝杯啤酒。
- 你什麼？
- I'd rather have a beer.
- You what?

1549
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,399
我寧願喝杯啤酒。
I'd rather have a beer.

1550
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:16,439
現在在那方面...
Now on that front...

1551
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,039
我知道有一條鏈子
未取得許可證的
I know of a chain
of off-licences

1552
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:25,439
存在於每一個個體中
世界上的首都，
to be found in every single
capital city in the world,

1553
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:30,000
即使在乾燥的國家，穆斯林
像這個國家，非常乾燥，
and even in a dry country, a Muslim
country like this one, which is very dry,

1554
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:35,039
你總是可以得到一杯杜松子酒
滋補品或一品脫提神的啤酒。
you could always get a gin and
tonic or a refreshing pint of beer.

1555
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,439
這裡有無執照。
它叫什麼？
An off-licence here.
What's it called?

1556
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,600
它無處不在。它是
給英國大使館打電話。
It's everywhere. It's
called the British Embassy.

1557
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,119
啊! 是嗎？
Ah! Is it?

1558
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,119
最好的排序。
Best sort.

1559
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:44,816
那是
英國主權領土。
That is
sovereign British territory.

1560
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,640
是的。
Yes.

1561
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,600
他們一定會歡迎
我們，或許你更不如此，
They're bound to welcome
us, perhaps less so you,

1562
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,800
然後我們就可以
喝一杯清涼的飲料。
and then we can
have a refreshing drink.

1563
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,439
- 它在哪裡？
- 喝完茶。
- Where is it?
- Finish your tea.

1564
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:55,159
我不想要它。
I don't want it.

1565
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,640
在哈蒙德的堅持下，
我找到了大使館的電話號碼，
At Hammond's insistence,
I found the number for the embassy,

1566
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,039
給我們預約了，
然後我們就去了那裡...
got us an appointment,
and we headed over there...

1567
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:05,359
立即。
immediately.

1568
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:23,880
這是我的
這份工作最喜歡的部分，
This is my
favourite part of this job,

1569
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:26,720
來到這樣的一個小鎮...
getting to a town like this...

1570
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,199
只是你得到的嗡嗡聲
來自這樣的小鎮。
Just the buzz you get
from a town like this.

1571
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,319
戈登·貝內特！
Gordon Bennett!

1572
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,720
哈蒙德出了事故。
Hammond's had an accident.

1573
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:43,640
他剛剛撞了我的阿斯頓。
He's just rammed my Aston.

1574
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,800
哦不，有人被驅趕了
進入他原始的 DB9。
Oh no, someone's driven
into his pristine DB9.

1575
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:51,359
你應該開車
更仔細一點，哈蒙德。
You should drive
more carefully, Hammond.

1576
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,359
不是我！他
剛剛經歷過。
It wasn't me! He
just went through.

1577
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,359
好的，我們有贏家了。女士們
先生們，我們有勝利者了。
OK, we have a winner. Ladies
and gentlemen, we have a winner.

1578
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,159
-哦！
- 我不知道那是什麼，
- Oh!
- I have no idea what it is,

1579
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:02,319
或者曾經是。
or was.

1580
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:05,680
嗯，其實我
真的不知道那是什麼。
Well, I actually
genuinely don't know what that was.

1581
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:09,119
沒有任何線索，
但它有點像旅行車。
Not a clue,
but it's a bit of estate car.

1582
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,455
我認為這就是
我們的汽車定位到此結束，
I think that's the
end of our car spotting here,

1583
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:14,159
因為你只是
無法擊敗。
because you simply
cannot beat that.

1584
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,359
幾次無崩潰之後
英里，我們到達了英國大使館。
After a few crash-free
miles, we arrived at the British Embassy.

1585
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,279
就在這裡，
章節。這是我們的俱樂部。
It's here,
chaps. Here is our club.

1586
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,319
你對他們講話嗎
作為您的大使，
Do you address them
as Your Ambassadorship,

1587
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,720
或者類似的東西？
or something like that?

1588
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:32,880
是的，你的至尊存在臀部。
Yes, your Supreme-beings hip.

1589
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,960
或者直接叫「房東」怎麼樣？
Or how about just 'landlord'?

1590
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:39,640
杜松子酒！
Gin!

1591
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,880
無論如何，聽著，聽著。
Anyway, listen, listen.

1592
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:47,359
當有人說時我覺得很有禮貌
「我可以請你喝一杯嗎？」你說，不，
I find it polite when somebody says
"Can I offer you a drink," you say, no,

1593
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:50,255
然後他們說，「你是嗎？
當然，」然後你說，「嗯……」
and then they're, "Are you
sure," and you go, "Well..."

1594
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:51,680
你看看
你的手錶，然後走，
And you look at
your watch, and go,

1595
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,120
「嗯，好吧，就這麼一個。」
"Well, all right, just the one."

1596
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:54,640
但你不說
是的，馬上。
But you don't say
yes straight away.

1597
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,600
因為，「你想要一杯杜松子酒嗎？
和補品？」 「是的！」 別那樣做。
Because, "Would you like a gin
and tonic?" "Yes!" Don't do that.

1598
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,335
是的，我認為是
有禮貌，對，對，對。
Yeah, I think it's
polite, yes, yes, yeah.

1599
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:01,199
我只能想到杜松子酒。
I can only think about gin.

1600
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,776
哦，那是非常
好的。哦，這不是很好嗎。
Ooh that's very
nice. Ooh isn't that very nice.

1601
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,439
- 只有英國人才這麼做。
- 有一片草坪。
- Only the British do this.
- There's a lawn.

1602
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,520
- 那是一片草坪。
- 有一個酒吧，但別看它。
- That's a lawn.
- There's a bar, but don't look at it.

1603
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:15,776
- 嘿！
- 早上好。
- Hey!
- Good morning.

1604
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:16,976
好的
早晨。你好嗎？
Good
morning. How are you?

1605
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,279
科林·威爾斯. 很高興認識
你。你看起來很聰明。
Colin Wells. It's very nice to meet
you. You're looking very smart.

1606
01:38:20,439 --> 01:38:21,496
- 哦是的。
- 你好。
- Oh yes.
- Hello.

1607
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,135
他整晚都在戰鬥
終結者。因此襯衫。
He spent all night fighting
the Terminator. Hence the shirt.

1608
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:25,000
成功地。
Successfully.

1609
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:27,359
- 請進去。
- 謝謝。
- Please go inside.
- Thank you.

1610
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:31,335
進展如何？
How's it been going?

1611
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:33,560
不錯
事實上，對於我們兩個人來說。
Pretty good
actually, for us two.

1612
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,159
嗯，當我們
我們發現我們要去毛裡塔尼亞，
Um, we were slightly confused when
we found we were coming to Mauritania,

1613
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:40,199
因為當我們
旅行得很好，
cos while we're
quite well travelled,

1614
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:43,399
我們都看，我們所有人...好吧，
他認為它根本不存在。
we all look, all of us... Well,
he didn't think it existed at all.

1615
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:46,439
他認為這是一個
CS劉易斯的發明。
He thought it was a
C.S. Lewis invention.

1616
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,279
但你感覺如何，
你什麼時候收到帖子的？
But what did you feel like,
when you got the posting?

1617
01:38:50,439 --> 01:38:52,319
很高興哦。我
想來這裡。
Oh very happy. I
wanted to come here.

1618
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:54,840
- 你想要嗎？
- 我想來這裡。
- You wanted to?
- I wanted to come here.

1619
01:38:55,279 --> 01:38:57,399
- 你知道它在哪裡。
- 我確實知道它在哪裡
- You knew where it was.
- I did know where it was,

1620
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,736
以及我生命中的很多人
以為我要去毛里求斯
and a lot of people in my life
thought I was going to Mauritius

1621
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,440
當我告訴他們我
本來要去毛裡塔尼亞。
when I told them I
was going to Mauritania.

1622
01:39:01,479 --> 01:39:04,760
確切地。「是的，我有
毛里求斯。」毛裡塔尼亞？
Exactly. "Yes, I've got
Mauritius." Mauritania?

1623
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:10,000
對不起，我應該給你
一杯喝的。我真的很抱歉。嗯...
I'm sorry, I should offer you
a drink. I'm really sorry. Um...

1624
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:13,119
- 是的，請。
- 你想喝點什麼嗎？我們有嗯...
- Yes please.
- Would you like a drink? We've got um...

1625
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:14,880
這裡的茶品種類豐富，
a good range of teas here,

1626
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,240
如果那是呃...會
你覺得這樣好嗎？
if that would be uh... Would
that sound all right to you?

1627
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,479
- 我有英式早餐，錫蘭。
- 不，嗯...
- I've got English Breakfast, Ceylon.
- No, um...

1628
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,359
- 茶，是的。
- 是的，可愛的。
- Tea, yes.
- Yeah, lovely.

1629
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,640
我就去
訂購其中之一。
I'll just go and
order one of those.

1630
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,335
- 謝謝。
- 請原諒我一會兒。
- Thank you.
- Just excuse me just for a moment.

1631
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:29,359
這是非常熱情好客的。
That's very hospitable.

1632
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,319
你撒謊。
You lied.

1633
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,496
- 現在看看發生了什麼。
- 這是你的錯。
- Now look what's happened.
- It's your fault.

1634
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,816
- 為什麼是我的錯？
- 你處理不當了。
- Why is it my fault?
- You mishandled it.

1635
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,399
這是英國的領土。
This is British territory.

1636
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,215
我們檢查過他是否喝酒了嗎？
Did we check that he does drink?

1637
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:41,576
我的意思是不太可能
大使不喝酒但是...
I mean it's unlikely that an
ambassador wouldn't drink but...

1638
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,000
你看見他了嗎？
Have you seen him?

1639
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,960
那不是一個男人
誰喝了一輩子湯力水。
That's not a man
who's drank tonic water all his life.

1640
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,880
如果我們立即說，
「其實我可以喝一杯嗎？」
If we'd immediately said,
"Actually could I have a drink drink?"

1641
01:39:51,079 --> 01:39:54,000
我會同意的。我的好禮貌
讓我們陷入了麻煩。
I will agree. My good manners
have got us into a spot of bother here.

1642
01:39:54,199 --> 01:39:55,199
是的。
Yes.

1643
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,239
我可以問，當我們獨處時，
Can I ask whilst we're alone,

1644
01:40:00,439 --> 01:40:03,800
因為你是 Jag 司機
你帶著畫回家嗎？
as you're a Jag driver, which
painting are you going home with?

1645
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,760
因為有一些非常好的。
Cos there's some very nice ones.

1646
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,960
- 你要去哪裡？
- 哦，夥計們。
- Where are you going?
- Oh, chaps.

1647
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,359
我已經把這件事徹底搞清楚了。
I've ballsed this up completely.

1648
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,399
這是他的「費拉羅羅氏」。
It's his "Ferraro Roche".

1649
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,760
- 你這個蠢貨！
- 好吧，那就是...
- You daft sod!
- OK, that is...

1650
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,000
這不是很低音...這些
人們被訓練得溫文爾雅。
That's not very am bass... These
people are trained to be suave.

1651
01:40:31,159 --> 01:40:32,760
他們又聰明又酷
They're smart, and cool,

1652
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:36,840
你已經打翻了他們
費列羅羅氏塔，你這個白癡！
and you've knocked over their
tower of Ferrero Roche, you cretin!

1653
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,400
把那些
以正確的順序返回。
Put those
back on in the right order.

1654
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:42,455
- 對不起，我不應該笑。
- 你踩到了那個。
- Sorry, I shouldn't be laughing.
- You've trodden on that one.

1655
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:45,239
- 我沒有踩過它。
- 有人有。
- I haven't trodden on it.
- Somebody has.

1656
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:48,000
對了，快點坐下。
Right, quickly, sit down.

1657
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:53,800
- 哦，抱歉慢了。
- 哦，我說。
- Oh, sorry to be slow.
- Oh, I say.

1658
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,079
這是一個相當不錯的鍋。
That's a rather fine pot.

1659
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:01,359
是的，
那是我們的官方陶器。
Yeah,
that's our official crockery.

1660
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:04,479
這正是我想要的，一個
喝杯茶，是不是很清爽呢？
That's exactly what I wanted, a
cup of tea, it's very refreshing, isn't it?

1661
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,640
這是。
It is.

1662
01:41:06,439 --> 01:41:07,880
非常感謝。
Thank you very much.

1663
01:41:15,399 --> 01:41:17,920
禮貌地喝一兩壺之後，
After a polite pot or two,

1664
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:23,800
我們找了借口，然後
能夠繼續我們的城市之旅。
we made our excuses and were
able to resume our tour of the city.

1665
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:27,936
讓我們有另一個裝備
改變。來吧，我們再做一次。
Let's have another gear
change. Come on, let's do it again.

1666
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,560
讓我們再來一次。快點。
Let's do it again. Come on.

1667
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:34,600
哇哦，又換檔了。
Aww, another gear change.

1668
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:44,560
很快，我們就來了
遇到一些相當有趣的事情。
Soon, we came
across something rather intriguing.

1669
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:47,680
這裡發生了什麼？
What is going on here?

1670
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,760
這是一條非常寬闊的路。
It's a very wide road.

1671
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:00,520
我知道這是什麼。
I know what this is.

1672
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,680
什麼？
What?

1673
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:06,319
他們建了一個機場
就在城市旁邊，
They built an airport
right next to the city,

1674
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:09,840
然後城市不斷發展，
有點淹沒了機場。
and then the city grew, and
sort of swamped the airport.

1675
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:15,039
他們還剩下一條跑道
就在首都的中心。
And they've been left with a runway
right in the middle of the capital city.

1676
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,656
哦，是的，因為看，有
那邊城市比較多，所以...
Oh yes, cos look, there's
more city over there, so it's...

1677
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:21,399
- 是的。
- 不是在邊緣。它就在裡面。
- Yeah.
- It's not on the edge. It's in it.

1678
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,600
這不是一個
絕佳的機會
Is this not an
excellent opportunity

1679
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,239
對於我們未能做到的事情
前幾天，即一場飆車比賽？
for something we failed to do
the other day, i.e. a drag race?

1680
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:27,199
哦，是的！
Oooh yes!

1681
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:29,119
跑道是
確實適合飆車。
Runways are
indeed for drag races.

1682
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:30,800
- 和他...
- 他已經痊癒了。
- And he...
- And he's mended.

1683
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,439
你可以參加。
You can take part.

1684
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,279
我還沒有提出它
邪惡勢力還在那裡，
I haven't raised it with the
forces of evil in there yet,

1685
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:36,840
但我很想嘗試一下。
but I'd love to have a go.

1686
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,279
由於跑道是
和其他廢棄的機場一樣空蕩蕩，
Since the runway was as
empty as any other abandoned airstrip,

1687
01:42:42,439 --> 01:42:44,560
我們決定出發了。
we decided we were good to go.

1688
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:47,720
對了，運動，
牽引力控制關閉，
Right, sport,
traction control off,

1689
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,640
使用槳、太陽鏡
放下，車窗升起，準備就緒。
use the paddles, sunglasses
down, windows up, ready.

1690
01:42:56,079 --> 01:42:58,239
它取消了運動模式。
It's taken sport mode away.

1691
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,680
你瞭解我的運動
按鈕？我決定不能擁有它。
You know my sport
button? It's decided I can't have it.

1692
01:43:04,359 --> 01:43:05,920
哦不，我又可以了。
Oh no, I can again.

1693
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:08,840
謝謝……師父。
Thank you... Master.

1694
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:17,159
V6、V8、V12。
V6, V8, V12.

1695
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:20,479
哪個最快？
Which would be quickest?

1696
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,800
捷豹的良好開端。
A good start from the Jag.

1697
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,399
哦！我的車很快！
Oh! My car is fast!

1698
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,560
一檔，二檔。
傑出的！它正在工作！
One gear, two gears.
Brilliant! It's working!

1699
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:42,800
等一下。
這就是……這就是交通。
Hang on a minute.
That is... that's traffic.

1700
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:49,359
跑道上有交通。
天哪，我要...
The runway has traffic.
Holy shit, I'm gonna have a...

1701
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:51,319
哇！
Whoa!

1702
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:53,359
瘋子！
Maniac!

1703
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,159
哎呀，這是什麼……
Jeez, what the...

1704
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:00,520
拉屎！
Shit!

1705
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:03,399
哦親愛的上帝！
Oh dear God!

1706
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:08,359
噢，那是一個……那是一個……
我正想打那個...
Oh, that's a... that's a...
I was going to hit that...

1707
01:44:15,239 --> 01:44:16,520
聖鉬！
Holy moly!

1708
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,920
那是最奇怪的
我曾經參加過直線加速賽。
That was the weirdest
drag race I've ever done.

1709
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,039
這不是
一條空跑道，是嗎？
This is not
an empty runway, is it?

1710
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:28,640
我不認為這是跑道
不再了。我想這可能是一條路。
I don't think it's a runway
anymore. I think it might be a road.

1711
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,000
我們不要再這樣做了。
Let's not do that again.

1712
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,856
謝謝你給我
當我需要的時候剎車。
Thank you for giving me the
brakes when I needed them.

1713
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,680
我非常感激
我很感激。
I'm very grateful
and I appreciate it.

1714
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:38,680
謝謝。
Thank you.

1715
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:51,920
第二天早上，
我們起得很早，
The next morning,
we were up bright and early,

1716
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:55,159
因為是時候了
離開努瓦克肖特。
because it was time
to leave Nouakchott.

1717
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:00,760
這些裝滿沙子的卡車，
他們要把它賣給誰？
These lorries full of sand,
who are they going to sell it to?

1718
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,359
他們有一些可愛的
這裡有賣沙子。
They've got some lovely
sand for sale over here.

1719
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:05,856
這裡有一大堆。
There are big piles of it here.

1720
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,760
如果你沒有
就像之前的沙子一樣，
In case you didn't
like the sand earlier,

1721
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,119
那裡有一些沙子。
there's some sand there.

1722
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,159
市場競爭非常激烈，沙子。
Very competitive market, sand.

1723
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:15,720
他們為什麼賣沙子？
Why do they sell sand?

1724
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:18,840
您實際上可以步行 30 英尺。
You can literally walk 30 feet.

1725
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:25,560
然後我們離開了
首都，向南前往塞內加爾。
We then left the
capital, heading south for Senegal.

1726
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:32,119
幾個小時後，我們開始
注意到我們周圍環境的變化。
And after a few hours, we started to
notice a change in our surroundings.

1727
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:35,520
我不會稱之為鬱鬱蔥蔥，
I wouldn't call it lush,

1728
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:39,680
但它不那麼貧瘠
到目前為止我們所看到的一切
but it's less barren than
anything we've seen so far,

1729
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,119
這是肯定的。
that's for sure.

1730
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:45,520
我認為我們已經非常接近
這裡是撒哈拉沙漠的邊緣。
I think we're very close to the
edge of the Sahara Desert here.

1731
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,200
他們在什麼
正確的？他們是牛嗎？
What are they on the
right? Are they cows?

1732
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:51,520
很多牛。這是一群。
那絕對是養殖的。
Many cows. It's a herd.
That's definitely been farmed.

1733
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,000
看它。
Look at it.

1734
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:58,119
這告訴我
我們已經穿越了撒哈拉沙漠。
And that tells me that
we have crossed the Sahara.

1735
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:00,720
你好，牛們。看著你！
Hello, cows. Look at you!

1736
01:46:06,199 --> 01:46:09,560
草。我在開車
第一次在草地上
Grass. I'm driving
on grass for the first time

1737
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,840
感覺像是 500 年。
in what feels like 500 years.

1738
01:46:13,079 --> 01:46:16,359
我們正在尋找什麼
是塞內加爾的邊界。
What we're looking for
is a border into Senegal.

1739
01:46:18,119 --> 01:46:22,000
所以會有，就像，你知道，
一個檢查站。我們走了。
So there'll be, like, you know,
a checkpoint. And in we go.

1740
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,159
我們又開得更遠了
沿著無數的軌道繼續前行，
We drove further and
further along the myriad of tracks,

1741
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,000
但即使一個小時後，
but even after an hour,

1742
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:34,680
我們還沒有發現任何東西
這看起來有點官方。
we still hadn't found anything
that looked remotely official.

1743
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:37,159
這該死的邊界在哪裡？
Where's this bloody border?

1744
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,960
我期待著，就像，柵欄
也許還有一個檢查站。
I was expecting, like, a fence
and a checkpoint, maybe.

1745
01:46:42,439 --> 01:46:45,399
是的，護照和
很快。是的，絕對是。
Yeah, a passport and
so on. Yeah, definitely.

1746
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,960
最後，我們的
搜索似乎取得了成果。
Finally, our
search seemed to bear fruit.

1747
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:55,640
這必須是一個
邊城。它一定要是。
This has to be a
border town. It has to be.

1748
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:01,920
不好了。
Oh, no.

1749
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,800
我有一種可怕的感覺。
I've got a horrible feeling.

1750
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:12,560
休斯頓，
Houston,

1751
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:15,159
我們出現了問題。
we have a problem.

1752
01:47:17,079 --> 01:47:20,600
我懷疑那就是邊界。
That, I suspect, is the border.

1753
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:22,640
嗯...
Um...

1754
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,760
對不起，我。
這是塞內加爾嗎？
Excusez-moi.
C'est Senegal, la?

1755
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,560
塞內加爾。這就是
毛裡塔尼亞？塞內加爾？
Senegal. C'est
Mauritanie? Senegal?

1756
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,760
塞內加爾，對吧。
Senegal, right.

1757
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,960
傑裡米，有一個
路上有一條巨大的河流。
Jeremy, there's a
huge river in the way.

1758
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,520
邊框有點多
河流比我想像的要多。
The border is a bit more
rivery than I thought it was going to be.

1759
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,600
- 我以為是柵欄。
- 我做到了。
- I thought a fence.
- I did.

1760
01:47:41,079 --> 01:47:42,920
沒關係。
有一座橋。
That's all right.
There's a bridge.

1761
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:44,175
我會拿出手機。
I'll get my phone out.

1762
01:47:44,199 --> 01:47:46,560
你要輸入什麼？
「我附近的橋樑」？
What are you entering?
"Bridges near me"?

1763
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,319
有一條路。
There's a road.

1764
01:47:52,359 --> 01:47:54,119
我們是最好的探險家。
We're the best explorers.

1765
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,199
- 哦，那裡的城鎮。沒有橋。
- 沒有橋。
- Oh, town there. No bridge.
- No bridge.

1766
01:47:58,359 --> 01:48:01,000
哦，耶穌。
嗯，你怎樣才能...
Oh, Jesus.
Well, how do you get to...

1767
01:48:01,159 --> 01:48:03,159
所以沒有人
曾經開車去那裡嗎？
So nobody
ever goes there in a car?

1768
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,399
不。
No.

1769
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,119
好吧，看，我已經走了
一百英里以下...
OK, look, I've gone about
a hundred miles down...

1770
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:09,175
- 那是...
- 上游，沒有橋。
- That's...
- upstream, and there's no bridge.

1771
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:12,560
這正是為什麼
人們以河流為邊界。
This is precisely why
people use rivers as borders.

1772
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:14,520
我們可以把車開上嗎...
Could we get the cars on...

1773
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,159
不。
No.

1774
01:48:16,359 --> 01:48:17,560
在那方面？
On that?

1775
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,055
其中兩艘船，我
正在思考。有點...
Two of those boats, I
was thinking about. It's a bit...

1776
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:21,840
但船……堅持下去……
But boats that... Hang on...

1777
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,119
如果我們造一艘船怎麼辦？
What if we built a boat?

1778
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:27,199
- 沒有灰塵或沙子？
- 我不是說方舟。
- Out of dust, or sand?
- I don't mean an ark.

1779
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:29,159
我只是想說，就像，
一個……那……呢？
I just mean, like,
a... What about...

1780
01:48:29,319 --> 01:48:34,439
我們這裡有什麼？二，
四、六……近六噸的車。
What have we got here? Two,
four, six... Nearly six tons of car.

1781
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,856
它實際上並不需要是一個
船。它只需要一個平台。
It doesn't really need to be a
boat. It just needs to be a platform.

1782
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,560
你看到了什麼
這裡有很多嗎？
What do you see a
hell of a lot of here?

1783
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,399
就在你站的任何地方？
Just anywhere you stand?

1784
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:44,079
我有什麼
自從我來到這裡後見過嗎？灰塵。
What have I
seen since I got here? Dust.

1785
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,399
- 沙。
- 山羊。
- Sand.
- Goats.

1786
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,936
- 駱駝。
- 就是這樣。
- Camels.
- That's it.

1787
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:50,015
- 還有一件事...
- 有沙子，有駱駝。
- And one other thing...
- There's sand, there's camels.

1788
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:51,439
數量龐大。
In vast numbers.

1789
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,880
塑料瓶。
Plastic bottles.

1790
01:48:54,079 --> 01:48:55,399
- 是的。
- 壓扁的塑料瓶。
- Yes.
- Flattened plastic bottle.

1791
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,039
是的，但是很多......我們已經
剛剛開車經過那個。
Yes, but plenty... We've
just driven over that one.

1792
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:02,039
如果我們發現...
好吧，找到，只是收集。
What if we find...
Well, find, just gather.

1793
01:49:02,199 --> 01:49:04,536
- 是的，一，二...
- 盡可能多的塑料瓶。
- Yeah, one, two...
- As many plastic bottles as we can.

1794
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,880
那邊有一個。超過
那裡。他們無處不在。
There's one over there. Over
there. They're everywhere.

1795
01:49:07,079 --> 01:49:08,415
- 這是一個好點。
- 我們建造...
- It's a good point.
- And we build...

1796
01:49:08,439 --> 01:49:12,159
如果我們能得到...做什麼
他們用...看，網。
If we could get... What do
they do with... Look, nets.

1797
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,239
- 你建議我們買一張漁網。
- 是的。
- You're suggesting we get a fishing net.
- Yes.

1798
01:49:15,399 --> 01:49:16,960
- 用塑料瓶填充它。
- 是的。
- Fill it with plastic bottles.
- Yes.

1799
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,520
- 我同意那會浮動。
- 是的。
- I agree that would float.
- Yes.

1800
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,399
- 然後我們在上面放了一輛車。
- 是的。
- Then we put a car on it.
- Yes.

1801
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,399
我不同意那會漂浮。
I don't agree that would float.

1802
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,375
- 如果你有足夠的瓶子就可以了。
- 確切地。
- It will if you have enough bottles.
- Exactly.

1803
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:25,880
這是浮力。
這只是物理學。
It's buoyancy.
It's just physics.

1804
01:49:26,039 --> 01:49:27,375
這不是一個殘酷和
不可預測的女主人。
It's not a cruel and
unpredictable mistress.

1805
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:28,199
不，不是。
No, it isn't.

1806
01:49:28,359 --> 01:49:29,880
- 什麼不是？
- 浮力。
- What isn't?
- Buoyancy.

1807
01:49:30,039 --> 01:49:31,479
- 當然如此。
- 這是阿基米德。
- Of course it is.
- It's Archimedes.

1808
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,600
被理解為...
It's been understood for...

1809
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:35,239
沒有人會被淹死
並不殘酷和不可預測。
Nobody would drown if it
wasn't cruel and unpredictable.

1810
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:37,015
- 自古以來就眾所周知...
- 是的。
- It's been known since antiquity...
- Yes.

1811
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:38,399
而且規則仍然有效。
And the rules still work.

1812
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,600
另外，我們也在整理。
Also, we are tidying up.

1813
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,215
- 我同意。
- 這是真的。是的。
- That I agree with.
- That's true. Yes.

1814
01:49:43,239 --> 01:49:44,616
我們要離開這個地方
比我們發現的更好。
We're leaving the place
better than we found it.

1815
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,079
那麼，在此基礎上，
我們要提示音樂嗎？
On that basis, then,
shall we cue the music?

1816
01:49:47,239 --> 01:49:49,079
- 嗯嗯。
- 提示音樂。
- Mm-hm.
- Cue the music.

1817
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:56,520
這可能非常有用。
That could be very useful.

1818
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:00,680
完美的。
Perfect.

1819
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,760
我需要躺下。
I need a lie-down.

1820
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:34,479
不，好嗎？只是
不。我對此不感興趣。
No, all right? Just
no. I'm not interested.

1821
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:38,199
哦。哦是的。
Oh. Oh, yes.

1822
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,920
花費了數千英鎊
Having spent thousands of pounds

1823
01:50:47,079 --> 01:50:49,880
有使用許可
所有這些 A-Team 音樂，
on a license to use
all that A-Team music,

1824
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:53,000
我們的木筏終於完成了。
our raft was finally completed.

1825
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,560
為了看看它是否有效，我們
決定先派出備用貨車。
And to see whether it worked, we
decided to send the backup van first.

1826
01:51:06,279 --> 01:51:08,159
- 我們吸引了一大群人。
- 是的。
- We've drawn a crowd.
- Yes.

1827
01:51:08,359 --> 01:51:10,359
期待我們
一切都會被淹沒，我們會的。
Expecting us
all to drown, which we will.

1828
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:11,399
- 不，我們不會。
- 我們將。
- No, we won't.
- We will.

1829
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,680
- 他們會失望的。
- 我們將。
- They'll be disappointed.
- We will.

1830
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:15,536
- 克拉克森！
- 什麼？
- Clarkson!
- What?

1831
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,319
- 一直向後。我那一面好嗎？
- 是的，直接回來。
- Straight back. Am I good that side?
- Yeah, straight back.

1832
01:51:19,159 --> 01:51:20,239
嘿嘿嘿！
Hey-hey-hey!

1833
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,439
正確的。
Right.

1834
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,880
現在，嗯，這是我的主意，是嗎？
Now, um, this is my idea, yeah?

1835
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:28,399
所以我是隊長。這次。
So I'm the captain. This time.

1836
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,199
呃，工作。有三種。
Uh, jobs. There are three.

1837
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:33,255
我要和貨車一起去。所以
我的工作就是把它從另一邊趕走。
I'm going to be with the van. So
my job is drive it off at the other side.

1838
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:34,479
詹姆斯，你在前線。
James, you're on the front.

1839
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:37,319
當我們到達那裡時，你就得到了
讓我們安全地到達銀行。
When we get there, you've got
to get us on the bank and safe.

1840
01:51:37,479 --> 01:51:39,319
傑裡米，你在操作
電機在後面。
Jeremy, you're operating
the motor at the back.

1841
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:42,840
但是，我只是想讓這絕對
清楚，我不相信這會起作用。
But, I just want to make this absolutely
clear, I don't believe this will work.

1842
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,800
哦，它會起作用的。
Oh, it'll work.

1843
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,319
好吧，不，聽著。真誠地、真誠地、
我不想有任何閒聊，
Well, no, listen. Genuinely, genuinely,
I don't want any cocking around,

1844
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,800
因為有一種疾病。
'cause there's a disease.

1845
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,920
嗯，這是一種寄生蟲。嗯。
Well, it's a parasite. Um.

1846
01:51:53,319 --> 01:51:56,920
血吸蟲病。呃，我們可以
把它放在屏幕底部
Schistosomiasis. Uh, we can
put that on the screen at the bottom

1847
01:51:57,079 --> 01:51:59,520
你可以用谷歌搜索一下。和
你就會知道這不是我編造的。
and you can Google it. And
you'll know I'm not making this up.

1848
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,680
在塞內加爾河中，
這個可以嗎？這是一種寄生蟲。
In the Senegal River, which
is this, OK? It's a parasite.

1849
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:07,720
如果你到水裡去的話
會附著在你的皮膚上，
If you go in the water, it
will attach itself to your skin,

1850
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,119
深入你的
肉，進入你的血液，
burrow through your
flesh, into your bloodstream,

1851
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:14,399
它被運送到你的肝臟，
你的腸道，它產卵的地方。
where it is carried to your liver and
your intestines, where it lays its eggs.

1852
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,399
別跳進去。無論如何
發生了，我們就去那裡。
Don't jump in. Whatever
happens, we'll chug across there.

1853
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:21,000
它就在那裡。
看，它就在那裡。
It's only there.
Look, it's there.

1854
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,640
啟動電機。
Firing up the motor.

1855
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:31,119
HMS Shit 是...啊啊！
HMS Shit is... aargh!

1856
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,359
渴望看到
一些喜劇翻船，
Eager to see
some comedy capsizing,

1857
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,560
當地人是
很高興把我們推開。
the locals were
happy to push us off.

1858
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:39,536
- 哦是的！
- 本來打算。
- Oh, yes!
- We're going.

1859
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:42,199
謝謝！謝謝！
Merci! Merci!

1860
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:45,960
我想如果你可以
當我們出去時轉向我們。
I think if you can
turn us when we get out there.

1861
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:47,479
好的。
OK.

1862
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,479
打電話的感覺很奇怪
理查德·哈蒙德隊長。
That feels weird, calling
Richard Hammond captain.

1863
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:55,359
我會照他說的去做，因為當
出了問題，那不是我的錯。
I shall do as he says, because when
it goes wrong, it won't be my fault.

1864
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,159
雖然很慢，但它正在繼續。
It's very slow, but it is going.

1865
01:52:57,319 --> 01:52:58,976
緩慢且
穩定，這就是我們所需要的。
Slow and
steady, that's all we need.

1866
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,800
放鬆。
Relax.

1867
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:02,000
一旦我們把它轉過來，
我們會取得更好的進展。
Once we've got it turned,
we'll make better headway.

1868
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:05,600
我應該帶一把椅子。
I should have brought a chair.

1869
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:08,439
前線即將轉過來。
The front's coming round.

1870
01:53:10,279 --> 01:53:11,439
前面是com...
The front is com...

1871
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,039
媽的！
Oh, shit!

1872
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:18,479
- 看看你是否可以啟動它。
- 好的，正在嘗試電機。
- See if you can start it.
- OK, trying the motor.

1873
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:22,840
呃，夥計們！我們已經失去了...
Uh, chaps! We've lost...

1874
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,960
- 什麼？
- 沒有什麼。不要恐慌。
- What?
- Nothing. Don't panic.

1875
01:53:26,119 --> 01:53:26,920
我們失去了什麼？
What have we lost?

1876
01:53:27,079 --> 01:53:29,335
嗯，我們已經失去了一些
該死的……瓶子都掉下來了。
Um, we've lost some of
the bloody... The bottles have come off.

1877
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:30,159
- 什麼？
- 什麼？
- What?
- What?

1878
01:53:30,359 --> 01:53:31,656
浮力瓶有
com...我們其實...
The buoyancy bottles have
com... We are actually...

1879
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:34,159
不，那不像我們
下沉。我們確實是。
No, that isn't like we're
sinking. We actually are.

1880
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:36,175
大家都站起來
這邊盡可能遠。
Everybody stand on
this side as far out as you can.

1881
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:38,479
- 哦，天啊！
- 誰鞭打那些？
- Oh, Jesus!
- Who lashed those on?

1882
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:41,479
呃，傑裡米，它
真的是真的在下沉。
Uh, Jeremy, it
really is actually sinking.

1883
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:44,200
- 發動機已啟動。
- 出色的。前往岸邊。
- Engine has begun.
- Excellent. Head for shore.

1884
01:53:45,239 --> 01:53:47,015
對了，我這就去
試圖讓我們回來，夥計們。
Right, I'm going
to try and get us back, chaps.

1885
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:49,760
好吧，我認為你是對的。
讓我們...我們將從中學習。
OK, I think you're right.
Let's... We'll learn from this.

1886
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,095
怎麼樣
看著另一邊？
How's it
looking at the other side?

1887
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:52,255
看上去有點沉了。
It's looking a bit sinky.

1888
01:53:52,279 --> 01:53:54,640
我想，我們
我想應該沒問題。
I think, we
should be all right, I think.

1889
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:57,119
又沒了！
It's gone again!

1890
01:53:57,279 --> 01:53:58,279
哦，耶穌。
Oh, Jesus.

1891
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,656
- 嗯。
- 這樣下去嗎...
- Um.
- Is that going down...

1892
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,976
正在進行中
下降得更快。
It's going
down much more quickly.

1893
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,359
噢，不，不，不，不，不，不，不！
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1894
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,359
我想可能是棄船了。
I think probably abandon ship.

1895
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,520
你能遞給我一瓶水嗎？
Can you pass me a water bottle?

1896
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:10,000
詹姆士！
James!

1897
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:11,880
遞給我一瓶水。
Pass me a water bottle.

1898
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:13,720
那是行不通的。
That's not worked.

1899
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:17,800
- 不，我不相信。
- 我是隊長。混蛋這個。
- No, I don't believe it.
- I'm the captain. Bugger this.

1900
01:54:20,119 --> 01:54:22,455
- 哈蒙德，你是隊長！
- 對不起！
- Hammond, you're the captain!
- I'm sorry!

1901
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:23,760
哦！
Oh!

1902
01:54:24,199 --> 01:54:25,199
謝謝。
Thank you.

1903
01:54:26,199 --> 01:54:27,640
我沒有……我還在。
I'm not... I'm still on.

1904
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:30,720
詹姆斯，一切都會過去
一路過去。你得走了。
James, it's going to go
all the way over. You'll have to go off.

1905
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:37,159
挖洞。
他們正在鑽進我的體內。
Burrowing.
They're burrowing into me.

1906
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,439
我是約翰·赫特。
I'm John Hurt.

1907
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,199
它已經沉沒了
比較...哦，上帝！
It has sunk
comp... Oh, God!

1908
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,295
- 它走了嗎？
- 它消失了。
- Has it gone?
- It's gone.

1909
01:54:45,319 --> 01:54:46,319
它消失了。
It's gone.

1910
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:52,840
我很好！
I'm all right!

1911
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:55,760
哈！出色地...
Ha! Well...

1912
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:57,656
- 你可以從那裡步行。
- 你可以從那裡步行。
- You can walk from there.
- You can walk from there.

1913
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:58,680
嗯，你說的是……
Well, you say that...

1914
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,415
但要保持腳步移動
或者你掉進泥裡就會死。
But keep your feet moving
or you sink into the mud and it kills.

1915
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:04,399
- 有這麼多糞便嗎？
- 是的，都是糞便。
- There's this much faeces?
- Yeah, it is all faeces.

1916
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,841
- 而且我已經攝入了...
- 很多嗎？
- And I have ingested...
- A lot of it?

1917
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,295
- 很多。
- 好的。
- A lot of it.
- OK.

1918
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:09,119
你只能靠你自己了。
You're on your own.

1919
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:11,039
你要
需要一些抗生素。
You're gonna
need some antibiotics.

1920
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,960
滿滿的一根大針。
A big needle full.

1921
01:55:14,359 --> 01:55:16,680
嗯，我可以指一下嗎
還有別的東西嗎？
Um, can I just point
something else out?

1922
01:55:17,239 --> 01:55:18,600
我們的貨車丟了。
We've lost our van.

1923
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:22,039
好吧，這很糟糕，但是...
OK, that is bad, but...

1924
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:25,119
我們已經收穫夠多了
建造汽車筏的材料。
we've already harvested enough
materials to build rafts for the cars.

1925
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:26,880
所以我們還沒有出去。
So we're not out yet.

1926
01:55:27,399 --> 01:55:28,199
他在說什麼？
What's he on about?

1927
01:55:28,359 --> 01:55:31,279
嗯，還有缺陷
通過這種特別的努力，是的。
Well, there are flaws
with that particular effort, yes.

1928
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:34,520
我們知道我們可以
做得更好並且應該。
We know we can
do better and shall.

1929
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,960
所以一旦你出去了
干了，就只有一件事要做了。
So as soon as you're out and all
dried, there's only one thing to do.

1930
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,520
不，這是音樂的提示。
No. It's cue the music.

1931
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:45,720
什麼？
What?

1932
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,320
- 我們還得過去。
- 我們不在那邊，是嗎？
- We've still got to get across.
- We're not over there, are we?

1933
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,455
- 我知道你感覺很粗糙。
- 我願意。
- I know you feel rough.
- I do.

1934
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:52,319
我知道你已經 63 歲了
你身上全是甲蟲
I know you're 63 and
you're full of beetles

1935
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,576
- 從你的器官中挖出出路。
- 是的。進入我的肝臟。
- burrowing their way out of your organs.
- Yes. Into my liver.

1936
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,976
你將會患上慢性病
下周腹瀉。
And you're going to have chronic
diarrhoea for the next week.

1937
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,039
- 是的。
- 但是那邊有一個酒吧。
- Yes.
- But over there is a bar.

1938
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,335
- 是的。
- 這裡沒有。
- Yes.
- Over here there isn't.

1939
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:02,159
是的。
Yes.

1940
01:56:02,359 --> 01:56:03,616
- 我們去那裡。
- 是的。
- We go over there.
- Yes.

1941
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,680
- 我們在酒吧裡。
- 所以我們說提示音樂。
- We're in the bar.
- So we're saying cue the music.

1942
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:07,120
- 是的。
- 提示音樂。
- Yeah.
- Cue the music.

1943
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,239
第二天，我們準備好了
The next day, we were ready

1944
01:56:43,399 --> 01:56:46,439
用於過境2.0。
for border crossing 2.0.

1945
01:56:53,159 --> 01:56:57,399
嗯，我們遇到過一些
複雜性，我承認。
Um, we've faced some
complexities, I admit.

1946
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:00,880
因為你必須保持領先
顯然，汽車從水中出來。
Because you've got to keep the front
of the car out of the water, obviously.

1947
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:04,479
但你必須擁有
後輪剛好在水裡
But you've got to have the
back wheels just in the water

1948
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,479
因為我們已經
附有槳，
because we've
attached paddles to them,

1949
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,720
像螺旋槳一樣，
like propellers,

1950
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,760
這將使我們前進
運動或反向運動。
which will give us forward
movement or reverse movement.

1951
01:57:13,239 --> 01:57:14,239
操舵？
Steering?

1952
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:16,520
嗯，這裡有一個舵
Well, there's a rudder here

1953
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:22,279
它附加到某種
門鏡旁邊的杠桿。
which is attached to a sort of
lever by the door mirror there.

1954
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:23,920
那是行不通的。
And that won't work.

1955
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,880
詹姆斯和理查德
我認為會的。我認為不會。
James and Richard
think it will. I think it won't.

1956
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,920
這太棒了。
This is brilliant.

1957
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:37,079
詹姆斯，你認為
這行得通嗎？
James, do you think
this is going to work?

1958
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:41,560
詹姆斯，你認為這是嗎？
去上班？傑裡米在問你。
James, do you think this is
going to work? Jeremy's asking you.

1959
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,159
- 詹姆斯·梅？
- 什麼？
- James May?
- What?

1960
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:46,640
你認為這個
要去上班嗎？
Do you think this
is going to work?

1961
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,079
什麼？
What?

1962
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,920
他這麼老了。
He's so old.

1963
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:53,640
你覺得……這……
要去……工作嗎？
Do you think... this...
is going to... work?

1964
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:54,800
是的。
Yes.

1965
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:58,439
好的，嗯，我要去
搏一搏。進入齒輪狀態。
Right, um, I'm going to
give it a go. Going into gear.

1966
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:03,079
渴望看到
昨天的災難重演，
Keen to see a
repeat of yesterday's calamity,

1967
01:58:03,239 --> 01:58:06,800
當地人更是如此
渴望幫助我們前進。
the locals were even more
eager to help get us going.

1968
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,119
謝謝。
Merci.

1969
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:11,279
謝謝，先生。
謝謝，謝謝，非常溫柔。
Merci, monsieur.
Merci, merci, tres gentil.

1970
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:12,439
謝謝。
Merci.

1971
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,279
舵展開。
Rudder deploying.

1972
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:25,521
哦，別碰方向盤
你個傻冒。它沒有任何作用。
Oh, don't touch the steering wheel,
you idiot. It doesn't do anything.

1973
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:28,199
你好！
Hello!

1974
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:31,479
我所看到的，理查德
哈蒙德，你和 DB9 正在……
What I'm seeing, Richard
Hammond, is you and the DB9 on a...

1975
01:58:33,399 --> 01:58:36,119
不，不要這樣做，
你這個自私的人。
No, don't do that,
you selfish man.

1976
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:43,439
我們的著陸點
塞內加爾一側
Our landing point
on the Senegalese side

1977
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,960
是一個小海灘
距離僅 400 米。
was a small beach
just 400 metres away.

1978
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:53,399
正確的。所以，現在我要走了
執行完美的曲線轉彎。
Right. So, now I'm going
to execute a perfect curving turn.

1979
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,079
登上登陸海灘，
Up onto the landing beach,

1980
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:58,760
開車，展示我的
護照，塞內加爾，啤酒。
drive up, show my
passport, Senegal, beer.

1981
01:59:00,199 --> 01:59:04,239
但是，我們很快發現
這一次，傑裡米是對的。
However, we soon discovered
that for once, Jeremy had been right.

1982
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,920
方向盤不起作用。
The steering didn't work.

1983
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:09,920
我無法轉身
左邊。我只能往右走。
I can't turn
left. I can only go right.

1984
01:59:10,119 --> 01:59:12,560
我什至向左轉
帶有全右舵。
I turn left even
with full right rudder.

1985
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:17,239
不會...我的不會
右轉。我只能向左走。
It won't... Mine won't
turn right. I can only go left.

1986
01:59:18,199 --> 01:59:19,976
我很想能夠
女士們、先生們，解釋一下，
I'd love to be able to
explain, ladies and gentlemen,

1987
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
我即將抵達彼岸
I'm arriving at the other side,

1988
01:59:22,199 --> 01:59:24,319
但我不是。我到了
回到我開始的地方。
but I'm not. I'm arriving
back where I started from.

1989
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,439
來吧，你這個混蛋。
Come on, you bastard.

1990
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,800
哦，我在蘆葦叢中。
Oh, I'm in the reeds.

1991
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,720
勞動節。
Mayday.

1992
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:34,880
胡說。
Bollocks.

1993
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:36,840
全反轉。
Full reverse.

1994
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:41,199
哦！不，你...
Oh! No, you...

1995
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,720
啊。
Argh.

1996
01:59:46,439 --> 01:59:48,119
我們已經建造了腳踏船，不是嗎？
We've built pedalos, haven't we?

1997
01:59:48,279 --> 01:59:51,680
是的，但是隨著
背面有很棒的品牌名稱。
Yeah, but with
great brand names on the back.

1998
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:56,399
接下來的一個小時，我們航行了
周圍，??設法去任何地方，
For the next hour, we sailed
around, managing to go everywhere,

1999
01:59:57,079 --> 02:00:00,119
除了海灘
我們正前往。
except the beach
we were headed for.

2000
02:00:00,279 --> 02:00:04,680
我在側邊漂流
錯誤的方向，就是我正在做的事情。
I'm drifting sideways in the
wrong direction, is what I'm doing.

2001
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:08,720
我做了什麼
是兩個巨大的掉頭。
What I've done
is two enormous U-turns.

2002
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:12,239
當地人認為我們精神錯亂。
The locals think we're deranged.

2003
02:00:15,319 --> 02:00:17,840
它帶著我
返回毛裡塔尼亞。
It's taking me
back to Mauritania.

2004
02:00:18,039 --> 02:00:19,560
我不想去
返回毛裡塔尼亞。
I don't want to go
back to Mauritania.

2005
02:00:20,119 --> 02:00:23,319
誰能告訴我什麼是
就在這兒，因為那是我要去的地方。
Can anybody tell me what's
down here, because that's where I'm going.

2006
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,199
海。
The sea.

2007
02:00:25,399 --> 02:00:29,479
我完全陷入了困境
我兩側有牆的角落。
I'm completely stuck in a
corner with walls on two sides of me.

2008
02:00:30,199 --> 02:00:32,640
轉吧，混蛋，轉吧。
Turn, you bastard, turn.

2009
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:35,856
我喜歡她的樣子
剛洗完衣服，
I love the way she's
just doing her washing,

2010
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:38,479
好像這發生了
每一天。
as though this happens
every single day.

2011
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:42,199
哦，該死的
一定不行。不好了。
Oh, bloody
hell, no. Oh no.

2012
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:43,399
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

2013
02:00:45,039 --> 02:00:46,640
別再撞我了！
Stop crashing into me!

2014
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:49,439
我又回到蘆葦叢裡了！
I'm back in the reeds!

2015
02:00:50,119 --> 02:00:52,255
有人成功了嗎
在任何時候都走正確的路嗎？
Has anybody managed
to go the right way at any point?

2016
02:00:52,279 --> 02:00:53,800
不。
No.

2017
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:58,119
已獲釋
我自己又從蘆葦叢中出來了，
Having freed
myself from the reeds again,

2018
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:02,279
我做了一個重要的事情
與轉向相關的發現。
I made an important
steering-related discovery.

2019
02:01:02,439 --> 02:01:06,319
如果你走得非常慢，
我的意思是，勾選，好吧，
If you go incredibly slowly,
I mean, tick over, OK,

2020
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,520
你可以右轉。
you can turn right.

2021
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:11,720
如果你增加
速度，你向左走。
If you increase
speed, you go left.

2022
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:22,199
與我們所有人一起
部署我的新發現，
With all of us
deploying my new discovery,

2023
02:01:22,359 --> 02:01:26,000
我們很快就要出發了
朝著正確的方向。
we were soon heading
in the right direction.

2024
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:29,640
哦是的！
Oh, yes!

2025
02:01:30,359 --> 02:01:34,199
我會去做的。
我正向岸邊走去。
I am going to do it.
I am heading for the shore.

2026
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,000
開車，開車！
Drive, drive!

2027
02:01:38,359 --> 02:01:40,720
我聞到啤酒味了！
I can smell beer!

2028
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:46,119
作為一個聰明人，我知道我會
需要大量的能量才能上岸。
Being intelligent, I knew I'd
need a big burst of power to get ashore.

2029
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,720
所以我抬起屋頂來保護
我的頭免受寄生蟲侵害。
So I raised my roof to protect
my head from the parasites.

2030
02:01:58,800 --> 02:01:59,800
做得好。
Well done.

2031
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,840
我已經快到了！
I'm so nearly there!

2032
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,640
拜託，就這一次，向左走。
Please, just for once, go left.

2033
02:02:16,359 --> 02:02:18,239
哦，我已經去銀行了。
Oh, I've hit the bank.

2034
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,960
我們的前輪是
在塞內加爾，這算嗎？
Our front wheels are
in Senegal, does that count?

2035
02:02:22,279 --> 02:02:25,640
哦，我想我們絕對是
是的，我想我們已經到了塞內加爾。
Oh, I think we're definitely
in Senegal, yeah, I think we've arrived.

2036
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,039
哇哈哈哈！
Wha-ha-ha!

2037
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:30,640
顯然，有
有工作要做
Obviously, there
is work to be done

2038
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:34,119
將這些返回為
普通陸上車輛，
returning these to be
normal land-based vehicles,

2039
02:02:34,279 --> 02:02:37,479
但還有更多的事情
重要的是要首先注意。
but there's something more
important to attend to first.

2040
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:53,720
你們兩個對我來說不一樣。
You two are different to me.

2041
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:59,359
我看著那個，我只是
想一想：「噢，多麼偉大的發明啊！」
I look at that and I just
think, "Oh, what an invention!"

2042
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:03,479
現在，看著
它，品味它，
Now, looking at
it, savouring it,

2043
02:03:04,359 --> 02:03:07,680
就像喝它一樣令人愉快。
is as enjoyable as drinking it.

2044
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:13,520
看看上面的凝結情況
玻璃杯，看氣泡，
Look at the condensation on
the glass, look at the bubbles,

2045
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:16,880
看看……細細品味
的期待。
look at the... Savour
the anticipation.

2046
02:03:17,079 --> 02:03:17,880
嗯嗯。
Mm-hm.

2047
02:03:18,039 --> 02:03:20,119
因為在
我的想法是一樣好。
Because in
my mind, it's as good.

2048
02:03:20,279 --> 02:03:24,119
從視覺上看，這是一個很好的
經驗。聽上去，很煩人。
Visually, this is a good
experience. Aurally, it's annoying.

2049
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:25,399
它很煩人？
It's annoying?

2050
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:29,640
我只是看到了美麗，
聽到胡言亂語。
I'm just seeing beauty,
hearing bollocks.

2051
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:35,800
顯然，我們
決定擁有多個。
Obviously, we
decided to have more than one.

2052
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:39,239
所以，就像哈蒙德一樣
進入下一輪，
So, as Hammond was
getting the next round in,

2053
02:03:39,399 --> 02:03:41,199
我溜到他的車裡
I slipped out to his car

2054
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:44,960
一點點
基於終結者的惡作劇。
for a bit of
Terminator-based mischief.

2055
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:49,479
如果我藍牙
我的手機連接到此揚聲器
If I Bluetooth
my phone to this speaker

2056
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:52,000
然後把它藏在哈蒙德的車裡
and hide that in Hammond's car,

2057
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:57,159
我可以給他播放消息
他會認為他的車正在和他說話。
I can play messages to him and
he'll think his car is talking to him.

2058
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:22,640
第二天早上，我們
重新召集繼續我們的旅程。
The next morning, we
reconvened to continue our journey.

2059
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,439
正確的。
Right.

2060
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:33,319
出去。滾出去。
Get out. Get out.

2061
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:38,319
- 這是什麼東西？
- 我的車剛剛告訴我下車。
- What the hell was that?
- My car just told me to get out.

2062
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:41,079
- 不。
- 它告訴我出去。
- No.
- It told me to get out.

2063
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:44,200
我必須承認，我會告訴你
如果我是那輛車的話就出去，但是...
I must admit, I'd tell you to
get out if I was that car, but...

2064
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:46,039
- 出去。
- 你聽到了嗎？
- Get out.
- Do you hear that?

2065
02:04:46,119 --> 02:04:47,920
我確實聽到了。
I did hear that.

2066
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:50,039
嗯，這很奇怪，不是嗎？
Well, that is weird, isn't it?

2067
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:52,200
你在它的
那天晚上用電腦嗎？
Were you in its
computer the other night?

2068
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:53,680
- 是的。
- 這就是問題所在。
- Yes.
- That's what's gone wrong.

2069
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:56,039
我對它有很深的感情。
I was deeply intimate with it.

2070
02:04:56,199 --> 02:04:57,239
無論如何，前鋒。
Anyway, forwards.

2071
02:04:59,479 --> 02:05:00,760
我就知道！
I knew it!

2072
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:03,279
孩子。
Child.

2073
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,079
你好你好。你好。你好。
Hello, hello. Bonjour. Bonjour.

2074
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:13,039
你好。
Bonjour.

2075
02:05:13,239 --> 02:05:15,560
你好。
Bonjour.

2076
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:19,600
塞內加爾。歡迎。
Senegal. Helluva welcome.

2077
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:27,119
我們現在只是情侶
輕鬆抵達終點線一百英里
We were now just a couple
of hundred easy miles to the finish line

2078
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:28,319
在達喀爾。
in Dakar.

2079
02:05:31,479 --> 02:05:34,279
還有我們史詩般的旅行
快結束了，
And with our epic trip
this close to the end,

2080
02:05:34,439 --> 02:05:37,600
這似乎是一段美好時光
反思機器
it seemed like a good time
to reflect on the machines

2081
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:40,079
這把我們帶到了這裡。
that had brought us here.

2082
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:06,055
我們詢問於
這個節目的開始
We asked at
the beginning of this show

2083
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:13,079
如果有可能建立一個
拉力賽突襲達喀爾沙漠賽車
if it would be possible to build a
rally-raid Dakar desert racer car

2084
02:06:13,239 --> 02:06:17,159
價格低於蘭博基尼
胡拉坎·斯特拉托。
for less than a Lamborghini
Huracan Sterrato.

2085
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:21,119
答案是肯定的。
And the answer is yes.

2086
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,039
是的。
Yes.

2087
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:33,439
我對此感到震驚
車。徹底驚呆了，
I'm staggered by this
car. Absolutely staggered,

2088
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:37,279
因為它用爪子抓著它
爬上岩石峭壁，
'cause it's clawed its
way up rocky escarpments,

2089
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:42,079
已經跨過河流，
它被炸過沙丘。
it's been across rivers,
it's blasted across dunes.

2090
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:45,479
與阿斯頓不同的是，
被魔鬼附身，
And unlike the Aston, which
is possessed by the devil,

2091
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:49,479
和瑪莎拉蒂，在
皮膚，正在脫落，
and the Maserati, which, under
the skin, is falling to pieces,

2092
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:54,359
這還沒有放一個
單腳錯了。
this has not put a
single foot wrong.

2093
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:00,800
我一直很喜歡我們用過的汽車
在過去的這些冒險經歷中，
I've been fond of cars we've used
on these adventures in the past,

2094
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,119
但沒有什麼像
儘管我很喜歡這個。
but nothing like as
fond as I am of this.

2095
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:09,000
我會想念它的
當我到達喀爾時，情況很糟糕。
I'm going to miss it
badly when I get to Dakar.

2096
02:07:09,199 --> 02:07:11,760
真的，真的很懷念。
Really, really miss it.

2097
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:21,240
現在，如果我對你說
一開始「我要採取
Now, if I'd said to you
at the beginning "I'm going to take

2098
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:24,760
「來自某個國家的一輛異國情調的汽車
小批量意大利製造商
"an exotic car from a
small-volume Italian manufacturer

2099
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:27,920
「我要修改它，我
開著它穿越沙漠，」
"and I'm going to modify it and I'm
going to drive it across the desert,"

2100
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,880
你可能會有
說：「不，你不是。」
you'd have probably
said, "No, you're not."

2101
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:34,359
但我們到了。
But here we are.

2102
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:35,840
它在這裡！
It's here!

2103
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:37,760
在前往達喀爾的途中，
On the way to Dakar,

2104
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:42,119
最終點
世界上戲劇性且艱苦的比賽。
the finishing point for the most
dramatic and gruelling race in the world.

2105
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:46,760
我們不要忘記，我的到目前為止
三輛車中最好看的，
And let's not forget, mine is by far
the best-looking of the three cars,

2106
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,520
我的是唯一的
現在看起來更好的一個
and mine is the only
one that looks better now

2107
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:51,560
比當時
這是標準的。
than it did when
it was standard.

2108
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:54,239
我其實已經
改進了原來的。
I've actually
improved the original.

2109
02:07:55,079 --> 02:07:56,399
優勝者！
Winner!

2110
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:06,680
現在，你可能會想像我會掙扎
提出令人信服的論據
Now, you might imagine I'd struggle
to mount a convincing argument

2111
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:09,760
我已經提高了我的
阿斯頓·馬丁 DB9 Volante
that I've improved my
Aston Martin DB9 Volante

2112
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:13,520
通過把它變成
拉力賽車手，但堅持住。
by turning it into a
rally racer, but hold on.

2113
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:18,159
如果我沒有這麼做的話，這輛車就會離開
不變，只是……
If I hadn't done that, this car, left
unchanged, would have simply...

2114
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:20,199
繼續生活
在彼得伯勒，
continued living
in Peterborough,

2115
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:23,399
郊區家之間的通勤
commuting between suburban home

2116
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,680
和一個中型的
貿易地產。
and a middle-sized
trading estate.

2117
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,696
隨著奇怪的旅行
週末去高爾夫俱樂部。
With the odd trip out to
the golf club at weekends.

2118
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:30,680
它會保持閃亮和漂亮，
但它本來就會變成這樣，
It would have stayed shiny and nice,
but it would have become what it is,

2119
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:33,439
這是一個稍微過時的，
慢慢褪色的例子
which is a slightly outdated,
slowly fading example

2120
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:36,079
曾經的豪華旅行車。
of a once-grand grand tourer.

2121
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:39,159
通過做我所做的事情，
By doing what I've done to it,

2122
02:08:39,319 --> 02:08:43,199
我已經能把它拿出來了
來這裡做一些不可思議的事情。
I've been able to bring it out
here to do something incredible.

2123
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,439
還有那些經歷
現在寫在上面
And those experiences
are now written across it

2124
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:49,760
在磨損和擦傷中
以及凹痕和裂縫。
in scuffs and scrapes
and dents and cracks.

2125
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:54,640
他們是它的生命線，
它的笑紋就在上面。
They are its lifelines,
its laughter-lines on it.

2126
02:08:55,279 --> 02:08:57,119
我喜歡它。
And I love it.

2127
02:08:57,279 --> 02:09:00,239
我把它做得很特別。它
並不特別。現在它是。
I made it special. It
wasn't special. Now it is.

2128
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:25,279
我們到達海岸
聖路易斯小鎮非常美麗
We hit the coast in the
surprisingly pretty town of St Louis

2129
02:09:26,319 --> 02:09:30,640
轉向南方，奔跑
與大西洋平行。
and turned south, running
parallel with the Atlantic Ocean.

2130
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:35,079
這給了我一個想法。
Which gave me an idea.

2131
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:40,520
我們為什麼不去達喀爾
像以前一樣在海灘上？
Why don't we go into Dakar
on the beach, like they used to?

2132
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:45,039
在集會上？它是
在海灘上完成。
On the rally? It was
finished on the beach.

2133
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:47,000
是的！
Yes!

2134
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,800
當然，我的同事們
沒有任何異議。
Naturally, my colleagues
had no objections whatsoever.

2135
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:59,399
所以我們轉向沙灘
完成最後 70 英里，
So we turned onto the sand
to complete the last 70 miles,

2136
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,239
正如種族
過去的事已經過去了。
just as the races of
the past had done.

2137
02:10:26,199 --> 02:10:27,760
增壓器已啟動。
Supercharger engaged.

2138
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:38,960
看那個！
Look at that!

2139
02:10:40,439 --> 02:10:43,199
巴黎-達喀爾！這就是結局！
Paris-Dakar! This is the finish!

2140
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:54,880
正是為了這些
人們的時刻
It will be for these exact
moments that people

2141
02:10:55,079 --> 02:10:58,920
忍受了痛苦並
參加巴黎達喀爾比賽的艱辛。
endured the suffering and
hardship of doing the Paris-Dakar.

2142
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:00,800
這就是他們
這樣做是為了。這！
This is what they
did it for. This!

2143
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,560
我要並肩而行
「倉鼠」理查德·哈蒙德。
I'm going to pull alongside
Richard "The Hamster" Hammond.

2144
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:14,039
看這個！我們在海報裡！
Look at this! We're in a poster!

2145
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:18,479
哦謝謝！
Oh, thank you!

2146
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:32,840
從來沒有這麼開心過！
Never had so much fun!

2147
02:11:37,159 --> 02:11:40,439
多麼美好、美好的一天。
What a wonderful, wonderful day.

2148
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,920
你好。
Hello.

2149
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:47,439
威爾曼先生發來的短信。
Text message from Mr Wilman.

2150
02:11:48,439 --> 02:11:52,800
「在進入達喀爾之前，你
可能想檢查你的新聞提要。」
"Before going into Dakar, you
might want to check your news feeds."

2151
02:11:54,399 --> 02:11:55,479
真的嗎？
Really?

2152
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:59,520
英國廣播公司的新聞。
BBC News.

2153
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:06,159
氣候變化、氣候
變化，氣候變化。
Climate change, climate
change, climate change.

2154
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,520
洪水、氣候變化。
Floods, climate change.

2155
02:12:10,039 --> 02:12:11,359
嘗試推特。
Try Twitter.

2156
02:12:12,239 --> 02:12:13,279
哦。
Oh.

2157
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,159
噢，天哪。
Oh, Christ.

2158
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:21,600
堅持住。未來。
你為什麼停下來？
Hang on. Coming.
Why have you stopped?

2159
02:12:25,239 --> 02:12:26,560
你為什麼停下來？
Why have you stopped?

2160
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:30,439
威爾曼剛剛說，
「檢查你的新聞提要。」
Wilman just said,
"Check your news feeds."

2161
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:34,319
那是達喀爾。
That's Dakar.

2162
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:37,920
什麼？
What?

2163
02:12:38,039 --> 02:12:41,680
達喀爾。有
適當的重大騷亂。
Dakar. There's
proper major riots.

2164
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:44,399
已經拉開序幕了
It's kicked off.

2165
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,279
哦，天啊。
Oh, geez.

2166
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:47,960
那是關於什麼的？
What's that about?

2167
02:12:48,119 --> 02:12:51,680
天知道。它是
一些政治……我不知道。
God knows. It's
some political... I don't know.

2168
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,680
- 有很多...
- 我知道有很多，它是...
- There's a lot of...
- I know there's a lot, it's...

2169
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:57,880
- 公共汽車正在燃燒......
- 天啊！
- And it's burning buses...
- Oh, God!

2170
02:12:58,079 --> 02:12:59,840
- 你見過這個嗎？
- 不。
- Have you seen this?
- No.

2171
02:13:00,479 --> 02:13:01,640
達喀爾。
Dakar.

2172
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:06,079
已經正式啟動了。
有槍戰。
It's properly kicked off.
There are gun battles.

2173
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,440
還有
火。有一輛公共汽車著火了。
And there's
fire. There's a bus on fire.

2174
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:09,920
是的。
Yeah.

2175
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:12,920
嗯...對。
Um... right.

2176
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,015
你不能
把船員帶到那裡。
You can't
take the crew down there.

2177
02:13:18,039 --> 02:13:20,800
不，我知道。沒人……我不
希望有人去那裡。
No, I know. Nobody sh... I don't
want anyone going down there.

2178
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,800
我的意思是，我知道有
計劃舉行一些抗議活動，
I mean, I knew there were
some protests planned,

2179
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,920
但這就是關於
三四天。
but that's about
three or four days.

2180
02:13:26,119 --> 02:13:28,680
反對已經過去了，但是
顯然很早就開始了。
It's over that opposition, but
it's obviously kicked off early.

2181
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:30,295
- 就是現在。
- 或者這是別的東西。
- That's now.
- Or this is something else.

2182
02:13:30,319 --> 02:13:32,656
- 現在正在發生。
- 或者它正準備出發，
- It's happening now.
- Or it's getting ready to go,

2183
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:34,880
這意味著它是
會變得更糟。
which means it's
going to get worse.

2184
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:38,239
等一下。
Wait a minute.

2185
02:13:38,439 --> 02:13:41,199
我們回家的航班是從達喀爾起飛的。
Our flight home is from Dakar.

2186
02:13:41,359 --> 02:13:42,359
這是。
It is.

2187
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,840
- 好吧，我們不能那樣做。
- 這不是一個選擇。
- Well, we can't do that.
- It's not an option.

2188
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:47,600
- 聖路易斯機場關閉。
- 什麼？
- St Louis Airport's closed.
- What?

2189
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:50,199
- 聖路易斯機場關閉。
- 關門了？
- St Louis Airport's closed.
- It's closed?

2190
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:53,359
關閉。
翻新。檢查了它。
Closed.
Refurbishment. Checked it.

2191
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,039
這意味著我們必須
乘車返回努瓦克肖特。
That means we've got to
drive back to Nouakchott.

2192
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:03,279
嚴重地？就是它
唯一的選擇？
Seriously? Is that
the only option?

2193
02:14:03,479 --> 02:14:04,680
好吧，我不會去達喀爾。
Well, I'm not going to Dakar.

2194
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:08,239
來吧，會很有趣的。
Come on, it'll be fun.

2195
02:14:08,439 --> 02:14:09,640
這是一場有來有回的反彈。
It's a there and back rally.

2196
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:11,640
好吧，那麼。
Right, then.

2197
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,159
這確實意味著一件事。
It does mean one thing.

2198
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:24,920
- 我可以使用傳統的結局。
- 是的。
- I can use the traditional ending.
- Yes.

2199
02:14:25,079 --> 02:14:28,000
論那可怕的
失望，是時候結束了。
On that terrible
disappointment, it's time to end.

2200
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:31,439
下次見。
感謝您的觀看。
See you next time.
Thanks for watching.

2201
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:34,439
操……見鬼。
F... ing hell.
