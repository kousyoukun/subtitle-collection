Hello, viewers. You join us
on a car ferry on the Baltic Sea,

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
just off the coast of Poland.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,080
The reason we're here is because
we're about to embark on a road trip

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,480
that no one's ever thought of doing.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,240
The reason we're doing a road trip no one
has ever thought of doing before is...

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,160
in these times,
it's very difficult to do a road trip

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,600
that someone has thought of doing before.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,440
Yeah, if you think about all the places

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,120
we've been to in recent years,

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,480
places that were stable
when we were there,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,240
that aren't anymore.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,560
Mozambique.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,760
Syria. Iraq. Burma.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,840
Ukraine. Russia.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,600
We couldn't go back to any of them.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,960
Or, for different reasons, Argentina.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,680
[James] No.
Or Turkey.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,720
- Why can't we go to Turkey?
- We're banned.

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,840
- Are we?
- Yes.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,480
But it's not just the places
where we've been before,

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,880
that there is a problem.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,200
No, absolutely right.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
For this show, we thought we'd drive
across the Sahara.

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,800
We can't - too much terrorism.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Then we said: "Let's follow
in the footsteps of Lawrence of Arabia

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,160
and go across the Sinai."
We can't.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Too much terrorism.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,000
We wanted to go from Bangladesh
to Mount Everest.

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,360
Can't.

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,480
Why couldn't we do that?

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,080
- You have to go through India.
- Is that a problem?

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,800
- I'm banned from India.
- Yes, he is. He is.

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,080
And anyway, it's because of all of that,

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,680
that we find ourselves here,
on a ferry, in the Baltic Sea.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,200
Yes, because we are about to undertake

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,200
a 1,400-mile drive

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,040
from - I've got the map here actually,
I'll fish this one out -

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,400
from Gdańsk which is
right up here on the Baltic, there,

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,480
and then we go all the way down here,

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,080
to Bled, in Slovenia.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,320
Nobody's done that ever,
Gdańsk to Bled.

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,120
Having decided to do a road trip
nobody's ever done before,

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Mr Wilman chimed in

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,040
and said: "OK, but you've got to do it
in cars that nobody

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,680
has ever used to do a road trip before."

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,600
And on that front,

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
- I'm the winner.
- You're so not.

A convertible pick-up truck sounds
like a bulletproof tea towel.

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,800
Why would you put
those two things together?

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
But that's what this game is about.

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,040
This is the most inappropriate
road trip car ever made.

It's the most

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,200
- inappropriate thing ever made.
- No, you say that,

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,600
it's a work of genius.

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Because what Mr Mitsuoka did

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,320
was he took the engine

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,120
from a 1990s Nissan Silvia,
an ordinary 2-Door Japanese saloon car

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
and the gearbox

76
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,320
and the interior
and all the electrics,

77
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,720
kept them as they were

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,640
and then fitted this flamboyant body.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,880
What Mr Mitsuoka did, was he took

80
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,440
acid and this resulted.

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
- Mate, for one thing...
- Yeah?

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
- Wheels.
- Ah, yes.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,800
[Richard] The ones at the back are hiding

84
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,080
and you're steering the car
in front of you.

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
- Yes.
- Look at it.

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,640
That is a mechanical change, I admit.

87
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,200
[Jeremy] These wheels are 3 feet in front
of where they should be.

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,520
There are other things.
Look at the horns.

Want to hear them?

- [Richard] Do they work?
- [Jeremy] Oh, yes.

- I don't think I do.
- Ready?

00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
They look like something
on top of a train in America.

- Yes.

[quiet horn]

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,480
How many of these has he made?

98
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
- Several hundred.
- Too many.

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,920
I think he made about 500 of them.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,800
This was supposed
to look like a Mercedes SSK.

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
And yet it really doesn't.

102
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
- This looks more like a Mercedes SSK.
- I disagree with you.

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
That ship looks more like a Mercedes SSK.

104
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,280
- This, look... There was a tremendous...
- [Richard] Wrong.

105
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,600
- [Jeremy] Can we move on to your car.
- [Richard] Utter brilliance, this.

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,880
- An SSR, I know what it is.
- Yes, it is.

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
I've never driven one, to be honest.

108
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,360
- I don't think anybody has.
- No, nobody did.

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
It was a convertible 2-seater
pickup truck. Electric roof.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,080
- The roof goes...
- In there.

111
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
So it's not really a very good
pickup truck.

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not very good as a pickup truck,
but it's very bad as a sportscar.

113
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,480
- Heavy?
- Yes, about 2 tons.

114
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,960
- It's...
- Yeah!

115
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,520
...absolutely hideous, isn't it?

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
No worries, I love it.

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,480
[Jeremy] Genuinely, I don't know
what that is.

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
[Richard] I've no idea.

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
[Richard] Have you just come
from the circus?

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,400
What is it, James?
It says Crosley on it.

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,200
Sorry, but it's a very precious car

136
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,720
and it's raining.
I've got to put the roof up

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,560
but it goes up like an MX5,
it takes a couple of seconds.

138

You can do it on the move.

139
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,920
It's a 1947 Crosley CC convertible.

140
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,840
Like me to tell you about the history
of the car? It's fascinating.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,600
I've a feeling you're going to.

142
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
In the 1930s,
there was a man in America

143
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,560
- called Powel Crosley Junior.
- [Jeremy] Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,240
He made his fortune
out of domestic appliances.

145
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,920
He was the first person to build a fridge
with shelves in the door.

146
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Something we all take for granted now.

147
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,840
He looked around and saw
that everyone was driving

148
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,840
massive cars and he thought

149
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,400
it was ridiculous, so he decided
to use some of his fortune

150
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,400
to make small cars.
He famously said:

151
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,720
"If you're crossing a river,
you don't need a battleship."

152
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,520
He decided he'd sell his cars
in his shops

153
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,000
alongside his domestic appliances.
That's why

154
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,480
this car

155
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,960
is only 4 feet wide.

156
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,520
It has to go through the door of a shop.

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,120
Good thinking on the part of Mr Crosley.

158
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,080

twenty-six and a half horsepower.

There's a bit of a story about that.

It was on a well-known
car auction website

176

It finished that evening

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,520
and bidding was at 400 pounds,
so I bid 450 pounds,

178
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
then I went off and got some wine,

179
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,000
and came back later
and it went up a bit

180
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
- and it was...
- [Richard] What did you pay?

- [Richard] Fair point.
- [Jeremy] So, hold on,

186

- I know.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Jeremy, a question whilst we cruise.

316
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,400
[Jeremy] Mm-hmm?

317
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,760
[Richard] That thing's supposed to mimic
the Mercedes SSK, yeah?

318
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,400
[Jeremy] Yeah.

319
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,880
[Richard] Wasn't a Mr A. Hitler
a fan of a Mercedes SSK?

320
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,320
No, because the SSK was from the early
30s when Hitler was a corporal

321
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,960
and corporals couldn't have afforded
an SSK.

322
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,200
[Richard] It doesn't mean
he wasn't a fan of it.

323
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,880
So you're driving a plastic,
unconvincing replica

324
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,520
of a car Hitler loved.

325
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,160
No.

326
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,760
I'm just not.

327
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,760
[Jeremy] Can you imagine
what it's like in the Crosley?

328
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,680
Do you know,
I don't think I actually can.

Where did he come up with that idea?

334
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,880
What was wrong with - I don't know -
1 litre?

335
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,960
[James] Oh Jeez!

344
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,080
[Richard] I know. It's amazing.
I love second biggest or best.

345
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,400
Because first is easy,
just make it bigger or better,

346
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,920
but second,

347

Mr Wilman has booked us in to take part
in some local racing, which is great

353
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,160
because we're like ambassadors.
This is a cultural exchange.

Without the culture

- [Jeremy] Exactly.

363

This is basically the Soviet Union's

I've heard about them,
you read about them.

384

All they had was a fuzzy photograph

A bit like that.

- [Jeremy]Yeah, "I want one of those,

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,920
but I've only got a Lada engine."

- You know boxing shoes?
- Yeah.

394

They wore those.

They're a bit like racing shoes.

- [Richard] What?

472
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,800
James May. Qualifying is in 2 minutes.
Is it 2 minutes?

473
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,680
- [man speaking]
- 2 minutes.

James May is still not here.

475

He needs to get a wriggle on or he won't
be here for qualifying.

That's the rules, mate.

Wouldn't it make more sense
to turn yours into the medical car?

509
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Thought about that.
Mine's only got 2 seats,

510
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,320

Could get it in yours.

[Richard] Does it do anything
if you put 50p in?

628
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,400
[Jeremy] I'll tell you what's funny.

629
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,080
I was just googling him.

630
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,760
He's the second tallest Jesus
in the world.

631
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,320
- Brilliant.
- One in Indonesia is taller.

632
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
That must be depressing.
Did this one go up first?

633
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,160
It must have done. You wouldn't build
the second biggest one.

634
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,200
You wouldn't say...
I don't know, we're in Poland.

635
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,520
We've been in the second biggest wood,
the second busiest port.

636
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,800
- [Richard] Yep.
- [Jeremy] I tell you what else I found.

637
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,880
Until very recently,
he had a cell tower on top of his head.

638
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,320
- And then there were some complaints.
- Why?

639
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,960
Because people were watching
strong pornography beamed to their phones

640
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,400
from Jesus' head.

641
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,160
[Richard] Yeah.

642
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,760
[Jeremy] That was a mistake,
putting the internet on Jesus' head.

643
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,520
[Richard] It's not dignified.

644
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,120
Also, there's a door in Jesus.
Who knew that?

645
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
- Look.
- Is that Jesus' back door?

647
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,280
[Richard] The next time
somebody surprises me

648
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,960
and I say: "Christ back door!"

649

656

This is Richard Hammond's territory.
He likes all this old stuff

657

from before the war and just after

658

I'm not [beep] surprised!

out if you look underneath.

662

that big Jesus.

Here's the plan for today.

694
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,440
Stop off at Stalag Luft III,
where <i>The Great Escape</i> happened.

695
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,800
A spot of lunch and then a long drive
to Krakow.

696

[Jeremy] Ever since we decided
to do this trip,

James May has been beside himself

with excitement about visiting
Stalag Luft III.

- Why that deep?

815
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,400
There was a reason.

816
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,840
The camp was called an escape-proof camp,

817
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,160
which means the Germans put underground
microphones around the camp

818
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,600
to detect any kind of tunnel.

819
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,480
- So they had to go deeper than those.
- Deeper than the microphones.

820
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,560
I'm staggered. I cannot believe

how deep it was.

There was a huge sports field

Hammond to pop his waxwork cherry.</i>

932
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,000
[Richard] <i>Oh, there's a...</i>

933
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,320
[they laugh]

934
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,040
James, that's really cruel. Stop it.

935
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,600
The people who run the place
will be bloody hurt.

936
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,320
[James laughs]

937
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,880
- [Jeremy] OK, it's not funny.
- [James] No, it's not.

938
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,600
[they laugh]

939
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,600
He is pushing out a whopper.

940
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,040
[Richard] He is definitely shifting

941
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,840
a big sturdy breakfast.

942
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,680
[Richard] Good lord!

943
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,000
[they laugh]

944
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,800
I didn't know you could stand...

945
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,920
[James] "I'd like <i>ein Volk...</i> Oh,
I'm sorry, I've fallen over backwards."

946
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,720
[Richard] Why is he leaning...

947
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,680
I've never seen him
with his tie like that.

948
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,640
He was very smartly dressed
as a general rule.

949
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,360
I think this has been
willfully treated poorly.

950
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,480
[Richard] I'm seeing brilliant things
in Poland.

951
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,760
[they laugh]

952
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,080
- [James] What the bloody hell is that?
- [Richard] Good Lord!

953
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,160
We know what it is because we've got
the helpful symbol on the wall.

954
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,600
[Jeremy] <i>Having seen all the pop icons,</i>

955
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,560
<i>we moved into what we assumed
was a motoring area.</i>

956
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,680
Is it you?

957
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,560
[Richard] No, it's not.

958
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,600
It is, it's you.

959
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,960
- It's Sylvester Stallone.
- [Jeremy] I thought it was you.

960
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,520
Guess who it is.

961
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,440
[Jeremy] Erm...

962
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,360
[Jeremy] George Lazen... I don't know.

963
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,800
- [James] Is it, bollocks!
- [they laugh]

964
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,520
Who the hell's that?

965
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,120
- Is that Keira Knightley?
- [Richard] I think it is.

966
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,400
That's not even an approximation
of Keira.

967
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,640
I would love to see Keira Knightley
standing next to that.

968
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,760
I'd like to see the real Keira Knightley
walking around Krakow.

969
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,480
Nobody would ask for her autograph.
They'd say: "That's not Keira Knightley.

970
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,000
It looks nothing like her."

971

[Jeremy] <i>After what may or not may have
been the Doctor Who zone,</i>

972
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,880

973
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,040
[Richard] Spooky woods.

974
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,080
[Jeremy] Some of the decoration
is tremendous.

975
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,640
[James] Everything is good,
apart from the waxworks.

976
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,920
[Richard] James May!

977
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,080
[Jeremy] Ryan Reynolds?

978
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,200
- [Richard] That's Paul Walker.
- [Jeremy] Oh.

979
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,160
[Jeremy] <i>In a room</i>

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,520
Oh, for heaven's sake!

982
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,400
[Jeremy] Nigel Mansell.
It isn't though, is it?

983
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,400
[Richard] His mustache matches
his eyebrows. It is.

984
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,440
Why have Nigel Mansell?

985
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,440
[Jeremy] Why not Lewis Hamilton?

986
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,920
[Richard] The reference is a bit
out of date.

987
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,640
- Bless him, but...
- Lando Norris.

988
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,760
George Russell.

989
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,200
[Jeremy] I'm really annoyed about this.

990
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,760
It isn't that it's not very good,
it's the wrong subject.

991
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,920
[James laughs]

[Jeremy] <i>I then had a brainwave.</i>

993
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,640
[Jeremy] I'm going to steal it.

994
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,040
[Jeremy] If we take him away,
they'll be forced to replace it.

995
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,840
With Lewis Hamilton.

996
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,480
Let me put it this way.

997
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,440
We've got many miles to get to Slovenia
and you're driving a terrible car.

998
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,880
- If we had this with us...
- Yeah?

999
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,920
It'd cheer us up.

1000
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,600
- [Richard] It would cheer us up.
- [Jeremy] Every time you're feeling low,

1001
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,240
sometimes Titties 'n' Beer
was being a bit badly behaved,

1002
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,880
you'd just have to look
in your rear wing mirror

1003
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,680
and there in my passenger seat...

1004
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,200
Is someone who looks
a bit like Nigel Mansell.

1005
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,880
Right.

1006
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,280
- We're off to...
- No, wait.

1007
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,440
- If we all...
- He's doing the talk.

1008
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,840
Do the Birmingham accent.
You're from Birmingham.

1009

[in Birmingham accent] "I've had enough
of this. Let's have a drive outside."

Just what I wanted to see.

it's not as good as this, is it?

I'm dressed and ready.

Oh, bugger, I knocked it.

- [Jeremy] We can get out this way.

somebody's house.

[Richard] It's possible.
They may be a bit surprised

1028

I'm driving the back-up car.

1088

The back-up car is here
for this eventuality.

The throttle pedal is actually buried
in the door,

00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,560
so I have to drive it without
my right shoe on.

1098
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,880
But the pedal is razor sharp
and it's digging into my foot.

- Hello? What is this saying?

<i>Som impotentný.</i>

1240
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,960
Oh. I'm impotent.

1241
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,480
- Important?
- "Impotent." Let me...

1242
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,000
Let me translate it.

1243
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,120
- Impotent!
- Yes.

1244
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,400
- What?
- [Jeremy] "I'm impotent."

1245

01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,080

[Jeremy] <i>Still, it could be worse.</i>

1249
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,840
Got to be honest,

1250
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,120
I'm not going to tell James May,
but I quite like his work.

1251
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,000
It gives a good Cruella vibe.

1252
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,920
[Jeremy] <i>We could have pressed on south
at this point,</i>

1253
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,160
<i>but we decided</i>

1254
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,960
<i>to hang around in Slovakia
for a little while longer,</i>

1255
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,200
<i>for a very good reason.</i>

1256
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,000
Today<i>,</i>
the Audi Q7 is made in Slovakia.

1257
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,840
So is the Q8.

1258
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So is the VW Touareg,
the Porsche Cayenne,

1259
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,960
the Porsche Cayenne coupé,

1260
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,160
the Land Rover Defender,
the Land Rover Discovery,

1261
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,560
the Peugeot 208 and the VW Up.

1262
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,240
They make more cars per head
of population in Slovakia

1263
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,240
than any other country in the world.

1264
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,200
[romantic music]

1265
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,760
[Jeremy] <i>Car-making has always been
in the blood in this part of Europe.</i>

1266
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,760
<i>In pre-Soviet times,</i>

1267
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,160
<i>Tatra were engineering demi-gods</i>

1268
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,160
<i>and they were even better
at aerodynamics.</i>

1269
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,920
<i>Even under the stranglehold
of communism,</i>

1270
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,080
<i>Skoda turned out handsome sportscars</i>

1271
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,880
<i>and rally weapons
that could meet and beat</i>

1272
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,720
<i>their well-funded rivals from the west.</i>

1273
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,000
<i>And that was just
the stuff we knew about.</i>

1274
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,880
In 1957, when communism
in Czechoslovakia

1275
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:52,160
was at its sootiest
and most monochromatic,

1276
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,200
a small band of engineers at Skoda,

1277
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,920
only about half a dozen of them,

1278
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,360
decided to build a car that could race
at Le Mans.

1279
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,800
And this is it.

1280
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,800
[Jeremy] <i>Although it was designed
as a racing machine,</i>

1281
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,840
<i>it was so tightly packaged
that the bonnet had a little dimple</i>

1282
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,640
<i>to accommodate the offset cylinder head.</i>

1283
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,960
<i>It is, nevertheless,
a thing of exquisite beauty.</i>

1284
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,960
[engine roars]

1285
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,280
[upbeat music]

1286
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,800
[Jeremy] It may only have

1287
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,760
1100cc,
and it may only produce 91hp,

1288
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,400
but the whole car only weighs
580 kilos.

1289
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,320
And at a top speed of 124 mph,

1290
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,400
in a car that's no bigger than my bath.

1291
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,280
It revs to 8,500 rpm.

1292
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,640
[engine revving]

1293

[suspenseful music]

1294
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,560
It even handles properly.

1295
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,520
The engine is at the front,

1296
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,320
but the gearbox is at the back.

1297
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,400
Perfect weight distribution.

1298
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,440
Well, it did before I got in.
That's changed everything a bit.

1299
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,600
I keep thinking the steering wheel
is going to snap.

1300
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,840
Look.

1301
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,800
That doesn't fill me with confidence,
but we'll gloss over it.

1302
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,520
This is the very definition
of a sports car.

1303
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,560
This is what Ferrari
should be making today

1304
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,880
and Maserati and Alfa Romeo.
Very small,

1305
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,600
very light, very fast.
An agile, frantic little car.

1306
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,120
I love it. I absolutely love it.

1307
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,840
[Jeremy] <i>Sadly, by the time the car

1308

<i>the Cold War had become so frigid</i>

1309

<i>that it never went to Le Mans.</i>

1310
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,040
<i>Only 2 were ever built.</i>

1311

<i>At this point, I was going to let
Captain Miserable have a go in it.</i>

1312
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,960
<i>But then I realised that actually</i>

1313
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,240

<i>That means it will reach 190 mph</i>

Oh my God!

1327

It has incredible steering.
It doesn't have a wheel, it has a yoke.

1328

Even on a fairly tight circuit,

I never need to move my hand

to that quarter to 3 position.

1331
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,040
It obviously has enormous acceleration.

1332
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,680
They haven't gone for top speed,

1333

It's wonderful. Just wonderful.

A million quid. A million of your pounds.

[Jeremy] It does look good though.

It's gotta look childish and silly...

- Yes.
- It is.

[Richard] But it looks accomplished
and finished.

1342
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,360
The Czechs were always good
at this sort of thing.

1343
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,800
They just had to put up with
a slight interruption:

1344
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,280
WW2, getting bombed and then
having to live under the Soviets.

You're right.

I must say this is an impressive piece
of engineering from the Czechs,

No, there won't!

Hammond is: "I've got sunburn."

1390
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,080
And Jeremy's saying: "I'm not sure
my A/C is working properly."

1391
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,920
[annoyed mimicking]

1392
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,280
They've no idea.

1393
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,440
[Jeremy] <i>Once inside Hungary,
we received word from Mr Wilman</i>

1394
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,240
<i>that we should report here.</i>

1395
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,200
This looks grass-track racing to me.

1396
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,320
God, it's sticky.

1397
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,800
[Richard] It's a country fair.
We'll be made to do Morris dancing.

1398
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,240
I got a text from Mr Wilman.

1399
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,680
[Richard] What does he say?

1400
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,160
I need my glasses, hang on.

1401
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,960
[Richard] We're judging
the terrier racing.

1402
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:10,200
"You are going to race in turn
around the track I've set up."

1403
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,920
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1404
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,720
"The winner is the one who is shot
the least amount of times."

1405
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,600
- What?
- [Jeremy] "Shot."

1406
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,560
Shot with what?

1407
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,400
[Jeremy] <i>Hungary is famous
for the Rubik's Cube</i>

1408
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,800
<i>and goulash.</i>

01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,360
<i>What everyone doesn't know,</i>

1411
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:43,840
<i>is that this country also produces
the world's best archers.</i>

1412
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,520
<i>And we'd arrived
at an archery academy,</i>

1413

01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,640
[Jeremy] It doesn't feel that sharp.

1418
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,200
Would this go in to the car?

1419
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,840
[James] It might do.

1420
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,240
[Jeremy] <i>There was only one way
to find out.</i>

1421
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,080
<i>Find a volunteer</i>

1425
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,240
[they laugh]

1426
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,400
- Right.
- [Jeremy] Move your arm, Nigel.

1427
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,280
"I'll stick it in me lap.
No funny business."

1428
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,000
[Jeremy] Right, here we go.

1429
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,080
[Richard] You're going to fire...

1430
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,960
[Jeremy] I'm just saying I don't think
an arrow will go through that.

1431
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,760
- But if they miss this...
- Exactly.

1432
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,680
- We'll be there.
- I know.

1433
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,800
OK.

1434
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,520
[Jeremy] What if it bounces back
and gets me in the eye?

1435
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,520
- [Jeremy] Oh!
- [Richard] Oh my Lord!

1436
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,600
- And that was you doing it.
- That was a bit worrying.

1437
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,560
Oh shit!

1438
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,400
[Richard, with an accent] "Oh, lads,
I've got an arrow in me 'ead."

1439
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,960
[Jeremy sighs]

1440
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,080
[Richard] They're pretty good.

1441
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,520
[Jeremy] The point I'm trying to make

1442
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,320
is that James May, at a range of 20 feet,
missed the target. Right?

1443
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,920
- And that was a stationary target.
- Yes, but...

1444
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,640
We're going to be driving along.

1445
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,320
[Jeremy] <i>To make things worse,</i>

1446
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,360
<i>another text then arrived from Mr Wilman.</i>

1447
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,160
"The archers will be shooting at you

1448

whilst riding horses."

1449
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,840
We'll be moving as the target,
but they'll be moving

1450
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,440
- themselves on horses.
- Yes.

1451
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:56,640
On an animal which is scared by
paper bags, wind, rain, sunshine,

1452
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,280
gravel, door knobs,

1453
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,560
- crisp packets...
- [James] Dogs.

1454
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,200
You're riding along,
"I'm just lined up on the target",

1455
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,800
and the horse sneezes or bucks
or does something.

1456
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,840
- Arrow in your face.
- Well, look.

1457
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,040
I know.

1458
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,040
[James] I'm well aware of it.

1459

[Jeremy] <i>Up at Mr Wilman's track,</i>

In 3, 2, 1, begin!

1467

[Jeremy] <i>James' tactic was to go slowly.</i>

1468

<i>Because he had no choice.</i>

found their mark...</i>

<i>Hammond's speed

1503
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,800
[James] Only 1 on this side.
Bit disappointing.

1504
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,320
- It broke though.
- It broke.

1505
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,000
[James] He's only got 7.

1506
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,280
4, 5, 6, 7.

[James] <i>But then...</i>

1508
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,560
[James] Ah! Wait a minute.

1509
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,800
[Jeremy] Wait a minute.
One of your targets fell off.

1510
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,200
- [Jeremy] What was it? 7?
- Plus those 3.10.

1511
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,080
You dropped a target before the end
so he gets a penalty of 4,

1512
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,920
which means 14,
so its neck and neck.

1513
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,080
Are these the international regulations
for this?

1514
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,440
You can't just randomly give me...

1515
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,320
- [accent] "I agree as well."
- There you go. 3 to 1.

1516
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,680
You can't bring Nigel in to this.

1517
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,880
[Jeremy] He just has.

1518
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,240
So that's 14, 14.
14 to beat.

1519
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:19,840
- [Richard] <i>J. Clarkson, are you ready?</i>
- Not happy, but ready.

3, 2, 1, go!

1521
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,640
[Jeremy] <i>Perhaps because they were
distracted by the sheer beauty of my car,</i>

Ouch! Christ!

1523

<i>the archers fired more arrows

1525
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,320
In the windscreen.

1526
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,040

[Jeremy] <i>Although this would guarantee</i>

1528

1538
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:10,920
You've won.

1539
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,280
I've lived. Nigel has been decapitated.

1540
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,600
And my candelabra is in tatters.

1541
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,640

[Richard] That is next level!

[Richard] That is really...

- [Jeremy] What?
- He's done me as well.

Oh... he is evil.

1702
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,040
He's also an idiot.
I've got 2 spares on my front wings.

1703
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,720
I'll have a wheel. It's a pickup.
There's bound to be one.

[Richard] I haven't got one.

[Jeremy] We haven't got time for this.

01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,400
Oh, Jesus. Come on, car,
you can do it.

1850
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,080

01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,440
[epic music]

1852
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,520
[Richard] Come on, James!

1853
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,840
It's a good job
the runway is 26 miles long.

1854
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,080
I'm pleased about that.

1855
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,240
It's longer than that one
in <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

1856
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,200
Much longer!

1857
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,560
[epic music]

1858
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,280
Buffeting. Buffeting.

1859
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,320
Argh!

1860
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,000
Yes!

1861
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,320
[Richard] Oh, my Lord!

1862
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:09,400
Wow.

1863
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,640
- James May caught the plane!
- Welcome aboard!

1864
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:14,480
Thank you.

1865
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,240
- We did it!
- We all did it!

1866
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,720
- We did a thing.
- That was extraordinary.

1867
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,160
[Richard] Err...

1868
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,200
[Jeremy] Oh, God, I know what...

1869
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,800
We've just driven on to an airplane
that just landed.

1870
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,480
- I've got a text.
- What?

1871
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,400
- It's from Mr Wilman.
- [Jeremy] Mmh-mmh.

1872
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,840
It says: "Do you want coffees?
I'm at the BA check-in."

1873
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,400
- It's in there, isn't it?
- There.

1874
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,120
So everything we just did
was nothing to do with this trip?

1875
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,080
No, it wasn't.

1876
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,440
And on that terrible disappointment,

1877
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,960
it's time to end.
Thank you so much for watching.

1878
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,200
See you next time.

1879
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:11,040
- [Richard] Somebody's going to be cross.
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

1880
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,080
