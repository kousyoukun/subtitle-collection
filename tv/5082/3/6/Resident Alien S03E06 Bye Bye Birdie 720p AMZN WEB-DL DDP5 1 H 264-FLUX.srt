1
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:03,394
《外星居民》前情提要...

2
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:04,482
哈利不能和那只鸟约会。

3
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:05,875
他应该拯救地球。

4
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,311
传送门已经修好了吧？

5
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:09,139
我们要搬到她的家乡星球。

6
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:11,489
有些人发现皮肤有碎屑

7
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,665
外星人用作追踪设备。

8
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:16,625
副官，我们在这里得到了什么？

9
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:17,930
有人在公交车站附近发现了它。

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,497
我会仔细检查一下，看看它属于谁。

11
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:22,283
你永远不会知道像希瑟和我这样的爱情。

12
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:24,024
我们互不保守秘密

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,373
就像人类一样。

14
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:28,115
你要帮助我们获取哈利的外星人 DNA。

15
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,246
你将离开这个星球，

16
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,031
你再也见不到他了。

17
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:57,100
这他妈到底是什么？

18
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,277
发现小灰人的计划后

19
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,756
改变地球的大气层，

20
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:47,107
我已经制定了自己的计划。

21
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,588
我正在制造一枚可以摧毁小灰人飞船的炸弹。

22
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:52,721
然后是他们愚蠢而美丽的混血儿

23
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,766
将被困在这里并且必须找到工作

24
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:57,508
作为私人教练和场外记者。

25
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,772
呃哦。

26
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:03,471
有问题。

27
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,997
我的血糖低得危险。

28
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:11,131
一旦将军拿到炸弹，她就可以完成任务，

29
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,176
我可以开始我的新生活了——

30
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,743
离开地球并消费

31
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,701
我和希瑟一起度过余生。

32
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:23,839
早上好，我美丽的天堂鸟。

33
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,145
毫米。

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,582
我可以给你做一顿美味的早餐吗？

35
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:31,194
我有一碗蠕虫和昆虫。

36
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,414
或者说还有一个

37
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:34,850
冰箱里的水生无脊椎动物。

38
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,156
哦，没关系。

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,592
我——我其实并不饿。

40
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,506
好的。

41
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:43,728
好吧，我可以，呃，咀嚼它。

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,776
将其重新送回嘴中。

43
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,821
这真的很甜蜜，但是不，谢谢。

44
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,650
我想我——我真的睡得不好。

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,783
你的人床不如鸟巢舒服

46
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:55,958
你让我在旅馆里。

47
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,742
那我今天就给你造一个新窝。

48
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:00,223
我会进城，收集树枝

49
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,573
还有绳子和一些头发。

50
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,314
不，哈利，你已经做得太多了。

51
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,708
我想为你做点什么。

52
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,926
侧翼工作？

53
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:10,102
更好的东西。

54
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,714
首先，我需要你改变。

55
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:21,853
你的鳃肯定需要清洁。

56
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,507
还有更多的来源。

57
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:28,904
你喜欢这个？

58
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,819
是的，我愿意。

59
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,516
哦，找到一个人真是太好了

60
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:35,345
你可以做你自己。

61
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,695
把一切都放在开放的地方。

62
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,133
没有秘密。

63
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,048
嗯嗯。

64
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,572
是的。

65
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:48,140
亲爱的，你的头在晃动。

66
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,403
哦。

67
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,926
你有什么心事吗？

68
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,014
诡异的。

69
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,233
呃，不。

70
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
什么都没有。

71
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,278
绝对没有什么可隐瞒的。

72
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,888
这是肯定的。

73
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,238
你可以再努力一点。

74
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,892
我喜欢这种痛苦。

75
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,633
哦。

76
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,374
我们可能需要一个安全词。

77
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,783
- 嘿。- 嘿。

78
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,611
你在这儿做什么？

79
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,395
我工作到很晚，所以...

80
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:28,137
回家路上我累了，就停了下来。

81
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,444
我的家不在你回家的路上。

82
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,923
你抓住了我。

83
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:36,101
我只是过来确认一下你还好吗

84
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,582
你就睡在这里吗？

85
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,803
我是说，你怎么上厕所的？

86
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,674
等待。

87
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:47,287
是关于你那天晚上说的那些外星人的事情吗？

88
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,290
外星人？

89
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,595
太疯狂了。

90
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:54,032
不，我只是——看看你。

91
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:56,339
如果这能让外星人远离，那就太好了。

92
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,428
我没有被外星人绑架

93
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,909
所以你需要在凯特出来之前回家

94
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,780
并开始提问。- 美好的。

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,609
嘿，你能帮我扔掉我的水瓶吗？

96
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:07,350
你尿在里面了吗？

97
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,830
你知道我做到了。

98
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,832
相当饱满。闻起来像尿尿。

99
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,399
你会把它扔掉吗，是还是不是？

100
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,443
- 不。 - 试一试。

101
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,575
里面全是尿。

102
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,491
真的吗？

103
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,144
这只是撒尿。

104
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:21,146
爱是的。

105
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,853
呵呵。迷人的。

106
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,376
你在这。

107
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,639
告诉我你没有再住一晚

108
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,162
守卫本和凯特的房子。

109
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,207
是的，但他抓住了我，

110
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,817
所以不能再这样做了。

111
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,384
今晚我得带双筒望远镜

112
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,473
把车停在街上，从那里观看。

113
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,345
这里有什么计划？

114
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,477
假设您目睹了一次绑架​​。

115
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,436
你究竟要如何阻止它？

116
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,002
棒球棒。

117
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,830
我在网上看过格雷斯的照片。

118
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,310
他们的脖子很长，他们的头

119
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,573
就在我的好球区。

120
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,662
不是抱怨，但这会杀了杰伊吗

121
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,360
偶尔洗一次盘子？

122
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,491
这听起来像是在抱怨。

123
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,623
我知道。

124
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:04,364
她是你的女儿，事实上

125
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,495
解释了她为什么不打扫卫生。

126
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,367
但她的东西却无处不在。

127
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,370
折叠沙发，始终打开。

128
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,894
哦，我的覆盆子酸奶又没了。

129
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,069
大惊喜。

130
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,027
- 你昨天已经完成了。- 是的。

131
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,160
因为我知道如果我不这样做，杰伊就会吃掉它。

132
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,291
美好的。

133
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,032
我会给你买更多的酸奶和干净的。

134
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,077
快乐的？

135
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:24,296
不。

136
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,907
杰应该这么做。

137
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,431
听着，我和杰伊现在关系真的很好，

138
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,128
我不想惹事生非。

139
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,000
此外，我们还有更大的事情要担心，

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,046
比如如何阻止哈利和希瑟一起离开。

141
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,266
杰似乎是我们当中最不重要的——

142
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,925
汤，家人？

143
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,462
仅供参考，你没奶了。

144
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,079
杰伊是我们当中最不重要的——你是说？

145
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,386
请别打扰我。

146
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,173
没有什么比一次好的鳃挖掘更好的了

147
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,567
让你再次焕然一新。

148
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,613
我能做什么来感谢你呢？

149
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,484
你不需要感谢我。

150
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,703
我不值得。

151
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,835
你值得拥有一切。

152
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:27,359
这就是为什么我要完成这个炸弹，

153
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:32,408
这样我们就可以离开，并且永远不会回头。

154
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:35,106
我迫不及待地想看看你的星球。

155
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:38,066
你的朋友会接受吗

156
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,373
你正在和一个没有翅膀的外星人约会？

157
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,114
我们先不谈未来。

158
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:47,031
让我们来谈谈现在吧

159
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,425
因为它太特别了。

160
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:52,254
你知道，我想这就是为什么他们称之为现在，

161
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,734
因为这是一份礼物。

162
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,127
这让我想起，我给你写了一首新诗。

163
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,302
你做到了吗？

164
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:58,521
我喜欢你的诗。

165
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,741
但别读给我听。

166
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,525
就停在那里，不要读它，

167
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,962
因为我要把这个拿出来

168
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:08,662
如果我不马上回来

169
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,925
那只是因为我跑出去买烟了。

170
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,188
但你甚至不抽烟。

171
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:17,801
我喜欢你尝试新事物。

172
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,721
这应该就是真爱的样子吧。

173
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,810
当你的爱人离开时，

174
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,334
你感觉你再也见不到他们了。

175
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:34,470
还有她的轮胎从我的车道上剥落的声音，

176
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,691
我看得出来她急着回到我身边。

177
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,048
给你，黛布拉。

178
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,092
早上好，警长。

179
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,051
嘿，副官。

180
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,575
嘿，你有没有过这样的感觉——

181
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,751
就像你被跟踪一样？

182
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,014
现在就想到了。

183
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,408
昨晚，我感觉有人跟踪我。

184
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,062
所以今天早上我改变了路线

185
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,891
但我认为约瑟夫那个混蛋还在跟踪我。

186
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,501
你知道这意味着什么，不是吗？

187
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,590
我们的调查进展顺利。

188
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,679
我们的调查？不。

189
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,290
我告诉过你，当我介入时，人们就会受伤。

190
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,291
我受够了。

191
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,249
什么？

192
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,511
我以为你只是需要时间

193
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,773
我不需要时间。

194
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,470
我需要距离。

195
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,821
花点时间可以帮助你更清楚地看待事情，副官。

196
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:23,388
嘿，你知道，克莱图斯曾经在我床上撒尿过，对吧？

197
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:25,303
现在，我很生气，但我摆脱了他吗？

198
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,217
不。

199
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,610
我花了一些时间反思

200
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,959
并找到正确的行动。

201
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,613
然后我就去他的小床上撒尿了

202
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,310
我对他说：“现在，你觉得怎么样？”

203
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,747
他就是这样学习的。

204
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,444
他们在你身上撒尿，你也在他们身上撒尿。

205
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,141
我不会去碰他的鼻子。

206
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,447
那就太残忍了。

207
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:41,058
不比我听这个故事更残酷。

208
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,407
嘿。

209
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,932
呃，我需要和你们谈谈一些事情。

210
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,281
我有一些抱怨

211
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,587
关于治安部门。

212
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,153
我告诉过你这是一个糟糕的主意

213
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:50,851
设立该意见箱。

214
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,723
是的，我是从您在建议箱中添加的注释中得知的

215
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,465
告诉我把意见箱拿下来。

216
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:59,076
似乎某些成分

217
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:01,209
对纳税人的钱不满意

218
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,082
浪费时间去调查与外星人有关的事情。

219
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,301
纳税人不应该有发言权

220
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,781
他们的税款如何花掉。

221
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,217
这就是无政府状态。

222
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,740
嗯，有些人称之为民主。

223
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,785
确切地。

224
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,438
这是一个自由的国家。

225
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,310
人们如果愿意的话可以寻找外星人

226
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,052
或在森林中寻找仙女，

227
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,793
即使他们只找到一只小青蛙

228
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,751
住在旧猎枪壳里。

229
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,800
你说有些人提出投诉。

230
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,975
我想知道是谁。

231
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,194
我不敢说。

232
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,369
嗨，警长。

233
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,067
娜娜。

234
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,678
谢谢市长给我们的简短谈话。

235
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,334
哦，来吧，丽芙。

236
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,293
你如何期望人们认真对待你

237
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:45,209
你的裤子上有那个折痕吗？

238
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,691
啊。

239
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,866
她是对的。

240
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,651
我确实有一个折痕。

241
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,740
她怎么看到的？

242
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,133
警长，我想在我的办公室见你。

243
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,526
毫米。

244
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:06,666
好吧，警长，请坐。

245
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,019
我要求在我的办公室见你。

246
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,194
不，你说

247
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,935
你想在你的办公室见我。

248
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,240
我不怪你。

249
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,764
天哪，我是一尊男子气概的雕像。

250
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,722
如果我在你的办公室，你可能会走进去

251
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:23,160
每天早上说：“该死，现在，这就是我想成为的人。”

252
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,335
如果你是我办公室里的一尊雕像

253
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,554
我会把我的夹克挂在你身上。

254
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,208
我希望你这么做，因为我会被创造

255
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,731
金属的，我会很冷。

256
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,037
看？

257
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,865
即使作为一个雕像人，我仍然得到我想要的。

258
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,170
好的，事情是这样的。

259
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,346
有人在镇上看到你和丽芙

260
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:38,741
穿着便衣窥探，调查某事。

261
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,961
更不用说，你知道，你实际上是如何求我的

262
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:42,397
寻找新的副手，但现在他走了

263
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:43,746
你还没有取代他吗？

264
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,139
到底是怎么回事？

265
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,401
你为什么这么神秘？

266
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,837
你为什么这么好奇？

267
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,056
因为我有权利知道。

268
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,666
这是我的城镇。- 哦真的吗？

269
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,450
你显然不知道城镇是如何运作的。

270
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,843
你看过西部片吗？

271
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,280
是治安官说，“你现在在我的镇上，”

272
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,804
不是市长。

273
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,806
你开的车上写着“市长”吗？

274
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:01,111
是的，我愿意。

275
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,373
- 你做？- 是的。

276
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,332
有时候脏了的时候

277
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,768
麦克斯在窗口写下“市长”，

278
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:06,900
那就是市长，

279
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,556
如“愿你...

280
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,516
“镇上，如果遇到麻烦，

281
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,431
我将成为解决这个问题的人。”

282
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:19,564
你的车门上可能有“警长”这个词，

283
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,479
但印着“霍桑”这个名字

284
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,698
在这个小镇的灵魂上。

285
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,265
正确的。就像那条毒溪。

286
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,266
忘记小溪吧。

287
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,484
那就是改名了

288
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,443
我不知道你为什么会这样。

289
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,923
你知道，我们曾经就像伙伴一样。

290
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,228
我们从来都不是合作伙伴。

291
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:33,535
我们在分裂的政府形式下运作，

292
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,711
像马达加斯加或东帝汶，

293
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,758
两位领导人分享不同的权力，好吗？

294
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,196
现在，如果你不介意的话，我还有工作要做。

295
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,807
人类通过建立彼此的联系而蓬勃发展。

296
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,027
但当这种联系被打破时

297
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:49,290
这让他们感觉不受束缚。

298
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,206
他们不喜欢那样。

299
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,599
这就是我开始的感受。

300
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,166
希瑟已经离开两个小时了

301
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,908
我能想到的就是，如果她受伤了怎么办？

302
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:02,390
如果她被拔毛塞进枕头怎么办

303
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,174
还是舒适轻便的夹克？

304
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:14,402
你好。

305
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,404
哦。

306
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,322
谢谢。

307
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:22,540

310
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:26,631
不。

00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:27,894
“别找我。

312
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,504
“请给阿洛一些麦片，

313
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,071
如果你不介意的话。”

314
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:34,814

但为什么？

344
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,892
因为我不爱你。

345
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,849
我从没干过。

00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,111
不。

00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,942
我不相信你。啊! 噢。

348
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,032
为什么？噢。

349
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,773
我想我的心脏正在停止跳动。

350
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:05,992
它不是。

351
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,341
宇宙中唯一的东西就是心

352
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,865
即使它们损坏后也能正常工作。

353
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,041
这是令人心烦意乱的事情。

354
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,521
你怎么知道？

355
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,089
是不是因为你的心也碎了？

356
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,742
不。

357
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:18,787
我的心还好

358
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,310
感觉很棒。

359
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,921
好吧，你不能带走我们的爱。

360
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,052
这不只是你的。

361
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:25,446
这也是我的。

362
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,100
抱歉，我必须要走了。

363
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,362
不，等等，我——

364
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:31,321
我有一首诗要读给你听。

365
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,236
你必须听。

366
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,938
标题是《永远在一起》。

367
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,898
“孩子，我简直无法停止微笑。”

368
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,900
- 不，我不能这样做。

369
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,554
我不能做到这一点。

370
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:48,860
好的 -

371
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:54,997
好什么？

372
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,825
“好的”？

373
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,698
“天哪，我爱你。”

374
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,831
“还好我是在开玩笑。”

375
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,137
哈哈哈哈！

376
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,095
啊？

377
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,407
“再见。”

378
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,021
“再见。”

379
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,157
为什么？

380
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,862
为什么？

381
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,124
为什么？

382
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,804
抓住你了，混蛋。

383
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,199
等等，你不是约瑟夫。

384
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,374
我——我是特洛伊。

385
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,375
特洛伊？

386
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,506
哇哦。

387
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,942
你是莉娜的儿子吗？

388
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,205
我只是好奇而已。

389
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,945
我想见见我妈妈正在约会的那个人。

390
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,164
来吧，儿子。

391
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,078
你不能跟随周围的人

392
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,210
在黑暗中，好吗？

393
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,820
这很危险。你可以放松一下。

394
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,083
我们没有约会。我们只是同事。

395
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,824
她不谈论她的其他同事

396
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:23,868
她谈论你的方式。

397
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,740
她谈论我？

398
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,307
我无意中听到她告诉我娜雅阿姨

399
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,699
你不喜欢她付钱买东西吗？

400
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:29,874
我不明白。

401
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,050
她付钱有什么问题吗？

402
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,052
听着，我很感激你在这里

403
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,140
为了保护你妈妈，好吗？

404
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,315
但这是成年人的事情。

405
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,968
你不会明白的。情况很复杂。

406
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,187
不，这不对。

407
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,102
从现在开始，你离她远点。

408
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,712
好吧，好吧，她已经远离我了。

409
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:42,974
她为什么不呢？

410
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,889
你让她哭了。

411
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,675
你是一个什么样的人？

412
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,120
哈利？

413
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:02,124
我收到一条短信说你想死

414
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,126
接下来是一个骷髅表情符号，

415
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,128
然后是绞索，然后是枪。

416
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,739
是的。然后是一把刀和一个棺材。

417
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,785
然后出于某种原因，一座教堂？

418
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,874
那是个错误。

419
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:15,398
本来应该是一把剑。

420
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:19,315
这是怎么回事？

421
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,577
希瑟离开了我。

422
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:21,839
是的。

423
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,754
是的，她做到了。

424
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,017
那太糟糕了。

425
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,367
她走了。

426
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,411
结束了。

427
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,804
现在我的生命结束了。

428
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,023
哦，我很抱歉，哈利。

429
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,721
不撒谎。

430
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,070
你很高兴。

431
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,465
红发的人努力忍住不笑。

432
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,901
看来你现在已经知道我的名字了。

433
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,424
好的。

434
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,122
听着，我们确实试图拆散你们，

435
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,775
但它不起作用。- 正确的。

436
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,429
所以也许只有你是这样的。

437
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:49,606
这有帮助吗？

438
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,042
我...

439
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,957
你错了。

440
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,959
希瑟爱我。

441
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,222
我爱过她。

442
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,137
我不知道发生了什么事。

443
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,444
有时没有解释。

444
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:02,445
哦。

445
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,186
嘿。

446
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,971
你只需要把你的心思从她身上移开，你知道的。

447
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:09,104
保持忙碌。

448
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:12,412
在这里专注于您的小项目。

449
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,805
哈，那是什么？

450
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:18,200
某种外星喂鸟器？

451
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,810
- 这是一颗炸弹。- 你说的是炸弹。

452
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,116
那现在是什么？

453
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,205
我建造它是为了一般人使用

454
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,643
我和希瑟离开后，在灰人家。

455
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,167
好的。

456
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,256
嗯，拯救地球，这是我们活着的目标。

457
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:33,041
我不关心地球。

458
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,390
这个地方很糟糕。

459
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,652
我讨厌这里！

460
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:36,871
呃！

461
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,135
嘿，格雷斯！

462
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,963
快来占领这个地球吧！

463
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:42,964
我不想要它！

464
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,618
你可以拥有它！

465
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,316
嘿，拿走这个愚蠢的植物！

466
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,317
我不想要它！

467
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:49,188
你可以拥有它！

468
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,233
拿走这把愚蠢的椅子！

469
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,147
啊？

470
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,975
我不在乎了！

471
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,803
- 好的。- 带我去！

472
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,500
我想死！

473
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,808
好的，请回到这里好吗？

474
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,940
吃点东西也许你会感觉好点。

475
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,203
我们给你买了一份披萨。

476
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,292
我不在乎你的披萨。

477
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,424
我恨地球，我也恨你。

478
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,904
哇！

479
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,341
我不是这样教你做人的。

480
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,345
阿斯塔努力工作才买了披萨，年轻人。

481
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:17,868
你会把你的屁股拿出来吃它。

482
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:20,044
我不在乎，我讨厌你！

483
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:21,307
我更恨你！

484
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,832
你知道，这是我一生中第一次，

485
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,703
我觉得我具备了当母亲的条件。

486
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,625
我终于见到了莉娜的儿子。

487
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,887
他一直在跟踪我。

488
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,890
他想看看他妈妈在和谁约会。

489
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,677
想谈谈吗？

490
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,287
现在。

491
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,593
没什么可谈的。

492
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,074
她说我们是同事，但后来我发现

493
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,642
她因分手而哭泣。

494
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,601
看来你想谈谈它。

495
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:55,906
不，不。

496
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,430
这是我们的安静时光。

497
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,737
安静的时光。

498
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,740
你知道，也许这就是我的命运

499
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,134
你知道，独自一人。

500
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,964
好的。

501
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,618
让我们来谈谈它。

502
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,057
她的孩子是对的。

503
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:18,886
什么样的男人有特别的人

504
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,932
然后就——就将她推开？

505
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:25,414
那种失去母亲的男人

506
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:29,113
当他年轻时，由父亲抚养长大。

507
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:34,945
你对这些男子气概的观念很着迷。

508
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,773
所以对自己放轻松一点。

509
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:37,905
这不是你的错。

510
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,301
现在我们可以钓鱼了吗？

511
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,780
你是那个想说话的人。

512
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,963
他是认真的想要离开。

513
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,313
这东西有所有的说明

514
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,749
关于如何处理这枚炸弹。

515
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,099
好吧，任何有成效的事情都会暂时搁置。

516
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,144
他只是问男人是否可以成为修女。

517
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,798
也许是最好的。

518
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,800
我不知道现在是否要他处理炸弹。

519
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,369
我厌倦了扮演这个外星孩子的父母。

520
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,763
自己在家做就够了。

521
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,331
是的。

522
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,377
什么？

523
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,552
没有什么。

524
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,467
你只是没有真正在家做这件事。

525
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,469
我告诉过你，杰伊和我处境很好。

526
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,341
我不想破坏它。- 正确的。

527
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,212
你害怕惹恼和我们住在一起的青少年

528
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,997
还吃了我的酸奶，所以现在我没有酸奶了。

529
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,564
我不害怕。

530
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:29,696
是的，你是。

531
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,088
你害怕你会失去她。

532
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,091
而你却在帮助和教唆她。

533
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,397
协助和教唆？

534
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,008
什么，现在喝酸奶是重罪吗？

535
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,663
不，这只是，你想成为

536
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:43,666
她的朋友而不仅仅是一个负责任的成年人。

537
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,495
如果我这么不负责任，你为什么跑来找我？

538
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,757
每次你遇到麻烦的时候？

539
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,672
因为你让我，这可能是

540
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,979
老实说，这整个问题是如何开始的。

541
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,284
哦，哦，好的。

542
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,285
所以我毁了你，因为我在你身边

543
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,504
你什么时候需要我？

544
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,419
不，只要你愿意，你就在我身边

545
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,855
当它让你自我感觉更好时

546
00:22:58,855 --> 00:22:59,856
就像哈利说的。

547
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,292
谢谢。

548
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,296
告诉我一次我不在你身边。

549
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,298
哦，我不知道，也许当你让我发疯的时候

550
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:08,865
对我保守一个改变生活的秘密

551
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:09,910
一年半了？

552
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,215
哦真的吗？又是这个？

553
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,391
我应该做什么，

554
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,827
告诉你新医生是外星人？

555
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,263
是的！

556
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,613
我应该是你最好的朋友

557
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:18,875
但你不能与我分享。

558
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,486
为什么？

559
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,878
我不打算讨论这个。

560
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,532
好吧，我们就在其中。

561
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,229
让我们把它放下吧，拜托。

562
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,057
我不想丢掉它。

563
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:28,407
我想知道为什么。

564
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,104
因为你是一门松散的大炮，

565
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,235
我不知道我是否可以信任你。

566
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,846
这就是你想听的吗？

567
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,151
你太冲动了

568
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,284
我只知道你会告诉别人。

569
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,242
那是胡说。

570
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,679
你不想告诉我因为哈利

571
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,464
降落到地球对你来说是天赐之物。

572
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,248
只有你。

573
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:45,902
你在自家门口发现的秘密小宝贝，

574
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,817
另一件是为你的贫困者动物园准备的。

575
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:50,080
你告诉本他被绑架了

576
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,342
当我告诉你不要这样做时。

577
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,735
无论如何你还是这么做了，因为你不听

578
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,084
因为一切都是你自己创造的。

579
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,346
我不。

580
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:56,391
我怎样才能让一切都围绕我自己？

581
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,653
告诉我。我想知道。

582
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,133
在这种否认中，有很多“我的”和“我的”。

583
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,570
我告诉本因为真正的朋友

584
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,703
不要互相保守巨大的秘密。

585
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:06,270
你告诉本是因为你感到内疚

586
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,055
所以你创造了关于你的一切。

587
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,883
好的。美好的。

588
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,188
我创造了关于我的一切。

589
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,886
但你创造了关于你的一切

590
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,237
说这与你无关，因为你是烈士

591
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,239
我宁愿当烈士，也不愿当一门松散的大炮。

592
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,936
嗯，这正是烈士会说的话。

593
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,503
- 松动的大​​炮。- 烈士。

594
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,640
假装我不在这里。

595
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,060
你为什么在这？

596
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,280
我是来看看你过得怎么样。

597
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,978
你穿好衣服了吗？

598
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,284
脱衣服？

599
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:05,852
或者现在就是这样？

600
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:08,550
你会这样问女人吗？

601
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,249
你的朋友阿斯塔联系了我。

602
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,731
说你一团糟，无法工作。

603
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,124
现在我不知道第一件事

604
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:19,909
关于如何安慰患相思病的外星人，

605
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:23,217
但我听说了你的鸡女友

606
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,219
或者无论她是什么。

607
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,655
所以...

608
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:39,581
这他妈到底是什么？

609
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,670
那家伙说她的名字叫帕特里夏。

610
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,672
我想也许她可以帮助你

611
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,587
克服你的女朋友。

612
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,588
没有判断力。

613
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,329
每个人都有自己的事情。

614
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,679
我很生气你认为

615
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,595
你可以取代我一生的挚爱

616
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,641
只是一些随机的鸟。

617
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:56,772
没有冒犯的意思。

618
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,469
这与你无关。

619
00:25:58,469 --> 00:25:59,862
你非常迷人。

620
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,211
做任何你需要的事情。

621
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,691
完成那个炸弹。

622
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,346
并且不要坠入爱河。

623
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,956
她是租来的。

624
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:16,792
别担心，我们什么都不用做。

625
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,318
我们可以谈谈。

626
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:26,802
尽管我自己从未遇到过不明飞行物

627
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,370
我来这里是为了支持我的女儿

628
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,633
因为我爱她。

629
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,635
我也爱你，妈妈。

630
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,854
哦，宝贝。

631
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:40,250
好的。

632
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,122
谢谢你的分享，多萝西。

633
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:44,864
所以这就是所有疯子聚集的地方。

634
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,084
我预计墙上会有更多的填充物。

635
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,831
- 你好。- 你来了。

636
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,877
是的。我当时就在附近，

637
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:59,139
所以我想我也可以。

638
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:01,532
你是新来的。

639
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,317
您想向我们介绍一下您自己

640
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:04,318
你为什么在这里？

641
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:05,667
哦，我？不。

642
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,800
嗯，我……我不是来参加的。

643
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,846
我只是来看看。

644
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,283
我们这里没有很多观察者。

645
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:17,287
嗯，我——我什么也没经历过。

646
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,159
我的意思是，我——

647
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,684
我一直在窗外看到这只猫头鹰。

648
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,990
但这没什么大不了的。

649
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,688
我的意思是，这是科罗拉多州，对吗？

650
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,690
有猫头鹰。

651
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,778
实际上有14个品种。

652
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,693
我--我在网上查了一下。

653
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,303
所以，你知道，不，我——

654
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,696
我想我很好。

655
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,356
除了，嗯，我不是——我不好。

656
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,140
我是...

657
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:51,887
我曾经很喜欢我住的地方。

658
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:56,762
但现在——我的意思是，我爱我们的——我们的家，但是……

659
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,811
但我在那里感觉不安全。

660
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,031
我是说，我——我什至——

661
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,816
我什至试图说服我丈夫卖掉我们的房子。

662
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:11,080
但我认为它比那更大。

663
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,952
就像，我想我在任何地方都不安全。

664
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:16,042
我只是觉得我快要疯了。

665
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,392
哦，我可以在这里使用这个词吗？

666
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:20,742
你没有疯。

667
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,701
我也有过类似的经历。

668
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,615
起初，猫头鹰似乎并不奇怪，

669
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,922
但随后这种事就不断发生。

670
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,924
我什至把我们的房子挂牌出售。

671
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:31,057
然后有一天，我在洗澡时，

672
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,886
我发现膝盖后面有一个小肿块

673
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,409
我从来没有注意到。

674
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:38,412
所以我做了一些研究，然后我意识到

675
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:41,241
这可能是他们植入我体内的芯片

676
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,982
以及世界各地的人们

677
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:45,288
都有过类似的经历。

678
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,597
你还好吗？

679
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,471
我不知道。

680
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,129
他知道你在提取他的 DNA吗？

681
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,348
不。

682
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:02,610
不过我感觉很糟糕。

683
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,785
我爱他。

684
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,569
噢，真甜。

685
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,615
你爱你的侄女吗？

686
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:08,790
我的膝盖？

687
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,618
你要打断我的膝盖吗？

688
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:11,924
侄女。

689
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:13,969
你的侄女，你姐姐的孩子。- 好的。

690
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,492
好吧，你可以直接说我姐姐。

691
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:16,493
我也爱她。

692
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,936
哦，快点。

693
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:25,894
侄女和膝盖，截然不同。

694
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,243
为何如此？

695
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:32,683
侄女是一个小女孩或法国的一座城市。

696
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,381
我不摔断膝盖。

697
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,296
我就在现场

698
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:40,126
看着阿斯塔的男朋友和哈利的女朋友

699
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:42,998
有一个约会。

700
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,827
她们两个听起来都像我姐姐的女儿。

701
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,655
你有一个叫膝盖的侄女吗？

702
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,049
是的。她是我的侄女。

703
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,877
我们怎么输给你们了？

704
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:03,236
轮班报告供您签署。

705
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,846
一切都好吗，副官？

706
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,979
你脸上挂着悲伤的表情。

707
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,197
真的吗？

708
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,372
我有一张悲伤的脸吗？

709
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:10,547
我会给你一个提示。

710
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,115
在这里，把这支铅笔放进嘴里。

711
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,725
侧身。

712
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,031
就这样吧。

713
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,859
你感觉到你的微笑肌肉在伸展吗？

714
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,600
看吧，当你悲伤的时候，你欺骗了你的身体

715
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,385
认为你是幸福的，然后你就会感到幸福。

716
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,213
多久时间？

717
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:25,519
呃，七分钟。

718
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,086
当然，我是专业人士，所以我用了三分钟就完成了

719
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:29,262
使用同一支铅笔。

720
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,918
告诉我，副官，是什么让你如此沮丧？

721
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,486
我今天参加了一场会议。

722
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:39,185
这个女人，琳达，带来了她的妈妈。

723
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:42,841
她只是来支持她的女儿。

724
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,974
我从来没有得到过这样的支持，

725
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,628
我可能永远不会。

726
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:48,716
毫米。

727
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,065
你知道吗？请坐，副官。

728
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,850
我——我想告诉你一个关于这个人的故事。

729
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,590
- 这个人是你吗？

730
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,765
呃，没关系。

731
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,593
不管怎样，有这么一个帅哥

732
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,421
味道真好，对吧？

733
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,423
他在青少年时期就失去了母亲。

734
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,077
现在，他的父亲——刘易斯？

735
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,862
我可以给你讲完这个人的故事吗？

736
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,733
- 是的。- 好吧，所以他的——他的父亲，

737
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,344
他可能推动了他的男子气概观念

738
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,172
对这个家伙有点太严厉了吧？

739
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:13,436
也许如果这个人能直面他的问题

740
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,047
早些年，他不会

741
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,526
让他的自我战胜他

742
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,311
还推开了一个完美的女人。

743
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,269
这个女人是莉娜·托雷斯吗？

744
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:22,097
我们就叫她米娜·弗洛雷斯吧。

745
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,969
好吧，听着，我的观点是，

746
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,362
我们是由养育我们的人塑造的。

747
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,974
而且你周围的人也不太支持你。

748
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,759
事实上，他们主动压制你。

749
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,501
现在你是我认识的最坚强的人

750
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,459
除非你在帕蒂奶奶身边。

751
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,939
你需要勇敢地面对她。

752
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,810
我不能。

753
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,292
她很刻薄，而且给人一种看似强大的感觉。

754
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:47,079
好吧，如果我告诉你我认识一个愿意和你一起去的人呢？

755
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,038
并给予你从未有过的所有支持？

756
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:51,083
这家伙是你吗？

757
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,127
哈！

758
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,302
你终于想通了。

759
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,652

760
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,089

有时间我会给你上一课。

766
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:10,667
一直想办法联系到你

767
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,060
但我看到你很忙。

768
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,235
兄弟，雪下得真棒。

769
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,715
你应该和我们一起去的。

770
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,065
是啊，随心所欲地下班一定很好。

771
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,980
太冲动了你知道吗？

772
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,373
好的。

773
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,942
那又怎样，你现在对我滑雪有意见吗？

774
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,030
没有。

775
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,031
哈利在哪儿？

776
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,162
我不知道。

777
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,337
上次我见到他的时候，我和你在一起。

778
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:29,338
嗯，我去了小屋，

779
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:30,339
但他不在那儿。

780
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,645
我只找到一只巨鸟

781
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:32,994
谁不是希瑟。

782
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,474
他绝对有一个类型。

783
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,780
好的。你为什么要找他？

784
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,000
朱迪看到约瑟夫正在和希瑟说话。

785
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,697
什么？在哪里？

786
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,003
我在现场，看着——

787
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,092
忽略——她开了滤镜。

788
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:46,877
我听不到他们在说什么。

789
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:48,270
我勒个去？

790
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,011
这只鸟是小灰人的间谍吗？

791
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,013
我们必须找到哈利并告诉他。

792
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,537
我知道他沮丧时会去哪里。

793
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,411
谢谢你带我们上山，史蒂夫。

794
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,760
是的，没问题。

795
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,718
无论如何，我必须飞越南峰。

796
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,851
我想你和我必须在周六澄清这一点。

797
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:04,983
凉爽的。

798
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,811
雪崩控制很重要，对吗？

799
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,988
嘿，你担心吗

800
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,294
我是某种松​​散的大炮

801
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:13,556
我会和你一起去那里

802
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,602
然后就把你推下山？

803
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,475
不。

804
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,737
啊。

805
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:21,738
所以你不会认为我是一个松散的大炮。

806
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,784
所以你相信我。有趣的。

807
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,178
史蒂夫，你不觉得这对某人来说很奇怪吗

808
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,397
骂你花时间陪你女儿？

809
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:29,529
我没有女儿。

810
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,617
是的，但你不认为，

811
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:31,966
在你经历了一切之后

812
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:33,054
你已经赢得了和她一起出去玩的权利了吗？

813
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,056
你知道，要无忧无虑一点。

814
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,841
嘿，史蒂夫，你想粉刷一下浴室吗

815
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:39,756
紫红色和呕吐物的组合

816
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,236
让沐浴时间变得愉快？

817
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:45,066
史蒂夫，你能买一张小咖啡桌吗

818
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,155
这么小，连咖啡桌上的书都放不下？

819
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,939
我们没有咖啡桌上的书。

820
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,593
因为茶几太小了。

821
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:51,812
我的天啊。我 -

822
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,271
我敲不了门。

823
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,446
我太紧张了。

824
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,057
当我来到这里时，这种情况总是发生。

825
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,580
没关系。

826
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,364
你刚刚给自己带来了一点“害羞”的情况。

827
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:23,713
我会全程陪着你。

828
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:24,975
来吧，握紧拳头。

829
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,718
噢。

830
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,546
我认为他们流了一点血。

831
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,115
丽芙。警长。

832
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:35,290
这是怎么回事？

833
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,728
我想和你谈谈一些事情。

834
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:41,122
你不能只给我发一封电子邮件吗？

835
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,907
我为什么费心去学习互联网

836
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:47,563
如果你要亲自出现？

837
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,001
好吧，进来吧。

838
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:55,180
擦脚。

839
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,052
这不是一家廉价旅馆。

840
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:05,625
嗯，那是什么？

841
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:10,673
你知道你所说的一切

842
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,241
关于我的头发和脸

843
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,200
以及关于我的几乎一切？

844
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,201
是的。

845
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,856
这——感觉有点卑鄙。

846
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:23,382
但这可能不是你的错

847
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,601
因为我知道你们这一代人过得很艰难

848
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:28,474
伴随着战争和一切，嗯，

849
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,867
我知道你出生在曾祖父的干草车里。

850
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,609
哦，你想道歉。

851
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,045
好的。

852
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:35,872
我原谅你。

853
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,439
是这样吗？- 是的。

854
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,963
呃，不在场，呃——

855
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,965
难道没有别的事吗？

856
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,188
Ay-yi-yi.

857
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,842
好吧，我承认，

858
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,323
我偷了你的芥末蛋食谱，娜娜，

859
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,760
但这只是因为我欣赏你的厨艺

860
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,718
我很欣赏你。

861
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:57,938
我想成为像你一样的人

862
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,375
但后来你却对着全家人对我说了垃圾话。

863
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,030
现在你已经说了所有那些可怕的话

864
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,553
镇上的报纸上有关于我的事。

865
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:05,728
为什么要这么做？

866
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,208
我只是说了实话。

867
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,253
我经常做。

868
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,906
哦真的吗？

869
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,692
嗯，我也可以说点真话。

870
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,084
哦。

871
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,348
祖母应该是和蔼可亲的

872
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,088
闻起来像饼干，

873
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:21,614
但你却残忍恶毒，浑身散发着醋味。

874
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:24,573
不是那种用来蘸面包的甜香脂，

875
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,358
但是英国的炸薯条醋。

876
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,881
好吧，你有点偏离轨道了。

877
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,404
小女孩就应该幸福

878
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:31,841
去看他们的奶奶，但我总是害怕，

879
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,409
因为你让我感到自己的渺小和无价值

880
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:37,238
我仍然有这种感觉，但我不会再这样了

881
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,935
因为你是个小人，

882
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:40,502
而你就是那个一文不值的人。

883
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:41,895
将其拨回一点。

884
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,027
你是一个古老的、愤怒的——--------，

885
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:46,247
你可以拿走那个------芥末蛋----

886
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,902
并制作一些------食谱和-----

887
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:51,470
把它塞满你的---------！

888
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,645
好的没问题。这就够了。

889
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,255
不不不。我才刚刚开始。

890
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,304
她在假装。

891
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:10,793
加里说她会没事的。

892
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,186
这只是一次轻微的心脏病发作。

893
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:14,144
我是说，当我们出现时她脸色苍白

894
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:17,104
所以她可能已经处于心脏病发作的前兆了。

895
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:18,279
谢谢。

896
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,063
另外，我告诉加勒特她有妄想症。

897
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,979
所以没有人会相信她的故事。

898
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,938
我喜欢住在小镇。

899
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,461
是的。你拿到你的食谱了吗？

900
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,376
是的。

901
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,595
谢谢你撬开锁。

902
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:30,639
我们走吧。我们从来没有来过这里。

903
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:39,360
决不。

910
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,606
希瑟正在和约瑟夫一起工作。

911
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,609
她走了已经够糟糕的了。

912
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,828
现在你正在散布关于那个女人的谎言

913
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:16,005
我曾经爱过，但现在希望它死了。

914
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:18,225
这不是谎言，哈利。

915
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,923
朱迪看到希瑟给了约瑟夫一个垃圾袋。

916
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:23,143
你知道为什么吗？

917
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:25,928
这是一个蓝色的垃圾袋吗？

918
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,408
是的。

919
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,063
她清理了我的鳃并将粘稠物放在那里。

920
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,674
你知道她为什么想把这些东西给约瑟夫吗？

921
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:35,111
我的DNA。

922
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,852
他们想克隆我。

923
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:40,465
他们有我的外星人球。

924
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:42,423
他们正试图操纵它。

925
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:46,514
但我把它给了外星人追踪者的儿子罗伯特。

926
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,648
如果灰人队绑架了他，那么他们就有球权。

927
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:51,650
你们这里有接待处吗？如何？

928
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,477
这很容易。

929
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:54,174
您只需进入设置即可。

930
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,393
它会提示你。

931
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,525
“你想驾驭这座山吗？

932
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,222
“用作您自己的个人手机信号塔

933
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:01,181
因为你是一个聪明的外星人？”

934
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,011
你只需按“是”即可。

935
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,708
太有趣了。

936
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,666
你好，儿子。

937
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,973
这是哈利，你的新父亲。

938
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,366
呃，不是死人。

939
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,063
呃，你好吗？

940
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,631
你还在地球吗？

941
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,198
是的。

942
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:20,592
我和伙计们在麦芽店。

943
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:24,378
灰队拥有球权。

944
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,467
他们要用它做什么？

945
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:29,470
我们的技术全部基于氢。

946
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,516
它帮助我们操纵水。

947
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:34,040
但如果小灰人能做到，他们就能加快速度

948
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,824
他们对黄石洞穴的计划。

949
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:38,697
等等，所以他们现在随时都可以毁灭地球？

950
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:40,525
更差。

951
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:44,093
我一生的挚爱并没有离开我。

952
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:47,053
她背叛了我。

953
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:48,707
爱就像生命线

954
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:51,753
将宇航员拴在他的船上。

955
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:55,888
如果这条线被切断，你就迷路了。

956
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:59,369
这就是我的感受，与唯一的爱隔绝了

957
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,546
我永远都会知道。

958
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:05,593
当我们所相信和信任的事物失去联系时，

959
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:08,466
就像我们呼吸的空气消失了一样。

960
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,207

Someone found it

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,497
I'll go through it

11
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:22,283

Good morning, my beautiful

00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,145
Mm.

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,582
Can I make you
a nice breakfast, hmm?

35
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:31,194
I have a bowl
of worms and insects.

36
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,414
Or there is also still one

37
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:34,850
aquatic invertebrate
in the fridge.

38
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,156
Oh, that's OK.

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,592
I'm--I'm not really hungry.

40
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,506
OK.

41
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:43,728
Well, I could, uh, chew it up.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,776
Regurgitate it
back in your mouth.

43
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,821
That's really sweet,
but no, thanks.

44
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,650
I think that I--
I didn't really sleep well.

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,783
Your human bed is not
as comfortable as the nest

46
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:55,958
you made me at the hotel.

47
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,742
Then I will make you
a new nest today.

48
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:00,223
I will go into town,
and I will gather twigs

49
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,573
and string and some hair.

50
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,314
No, Harry, you've already
done too much.

51
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,708
I want to do something for you.

52
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,926
A wing job?

53
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:10,102
Something even better.

54
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,714
First, I need you to change.

55
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:21,853
Your gills definitely
needed a cleaning.

56
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,507
There's more
where that came from.

57
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:28,904
You like this?

58
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,819
Yes, I do.

59
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,516
Oh, it is so nice
to find someone

60
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:35,345
you can be yourself with.

61
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,695
Just leave everything
out in the open.

62
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,133
No secrets.

63
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,048
Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,572
Yeah.

65
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:48,140
My love,
your head is bobbing.

66
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,403
Oh.

67
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,926
Is there something
on your mind?

68
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,014
Weird.

69
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,233
Uh, no.

70
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
Nothing at all.

71
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,278
Definitely nothing to hide.

72
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,888
That's for sure.

73
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,238
You can go harder.

74
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,892
I like the pain.

75
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,633
Oh.

76
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,374
We might need a safe word.

77
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,783
- Hey.
- Hey.

78
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,611
What are you doing out here?

79
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,395
I worked late, so...

80
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:28,137
I got tired on my way home,
pulled over.

81
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,444
My house isn't
on your way home.

82
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,923
You got me.

83
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:36,101
I just came by to make sure
you're doing OK.

84
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,582
And you slept out here?

85
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,803
I mean, how did you even
use the bathroom?

86
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,674
Wait.

87
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:47,287
Is this about the alien stuff
that you said the other night?

88
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,290
Aliens?

89
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,595
That's crazy.

90
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:54,032
No, I just--
checking up on you.

91
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:56,339
If that keeps aliens away,
then great.

92
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,428
I was not abducted by aliens,

93
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,909
so you need to go home
before Kate comes out

94
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,780
and starts asking questions.
- Fine.

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,609
Hey, would you toss
my water bottle for me?

96
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:07,350
Did you piss in it?

97
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,830
You know I did.

98
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,832
Pretty full.
Smells like pee-pee.

99
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,399
Would you throw it out,
yes or no?

100
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,443
- No.
- Give it a toss.

101
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,575
It's full of urine.

102
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,491
Really?

103
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,144
It's just pee.

104
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:21,146
Love ya.

105
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,853
Huh. Lovely.

106
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,376
There you are.

107
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,639
Tell me you did not spend
another night

108
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,162
guarding Ben and Kate's house.

109
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,207
Yeah, but he caught me,

110
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,817
so can't do that again.

111
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,384
Tonight I'll have to bring
binoculars

112
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,473
and park up the street,
watch from there.

113
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,345
What's the plan here?

114
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,477
Let's say you witness
an abduction.

115
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,436
How exactly are you
gonna stop it?

116
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,002
Baseball bat.

117
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,830
I've seen pictures of Greys
on the internet.

118
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,310
Their long necks,
their heads are

119
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,573
just right in my strike zone.

120
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,662
Not to complain,
but would it kill Jay

121
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,360
to wash a dish once in a while?

122
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,491
That sounds like complaining.

123
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,623
I know.

124
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:04,364
She's your daughter,
and that actually

125
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,495
explains why she doesn't clean.

126
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,367
But her stuff is everywhere.

127
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,370
Pullout couch, always open.

128
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,894
Oh, my raspberry yogurt's
gone again.

129
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,069
Big surprise.

130
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,027
- You finished that yesterday.
- Yeah.

131
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,160
Because I knew if I didn't,
Jay would eat it.

132
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,291
Fine.

133
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,032
I'll buy you more yogurt
and clean.

134
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,077
Happy?

135
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:24,296
No.

136
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,907
Jay should be doing that.

137
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,431
Look, things are really good
between Jay and I right now,

138
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,128
and I don't want
to rock the boat.

139
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,000
Besides, we have
bigger things to worry about,

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,046
like how to keep Harry
from leaving with Heather.

141
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,266
Jay seems like
the least of our--

142
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,925
Sup, fam?

143
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,462
You're out of milk, FYI.

144
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,079
Jay's the least of our--
you were saying?

145
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,386
Leave me alone.

146
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,173
Nothing like
a good gill excavation

147
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,567
to make you feel new again.

148
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,613
What can I do to thank you?

149
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,484
You don't need to thank me.

150
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,703
I don't deserve it.

151
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,835
You deserve everything.

152
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:27,359
That is why
I will finish this bomb,

153
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:32,408
so that we can leave
and we can never look back.

154
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:35,106
I cannot wait to see
your planet.

155
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:38,066
Will your friends accept

156
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,373
that you are dating
an un-winged alien?

157
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,114
Let's not talk
about the future.

158
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:47,031
Let's just--let's just talk
about the present

159
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,425
because it's so special.

160
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:52,254
You know, I think that's
why they call it the present,

161
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,734
'cause it's a present.

162
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,127
That reminds me,
I wrote you a--a new poem.

163
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,302
You did?

164
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:58,521
I love your poems.

165
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,741
But don't read it to me.

166
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,525
Stop right there
and do not read it,

167
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,962
because I'm gonna
take this out,

168
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:08,662
and if I don't come right back,

169
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,925
that's just because
I ran out to get cigarettes.

170
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,188
But you do not even smoke.

171
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:17,801
I love that you try new things.

172
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,721
<i>This must be
what true love is like.</i>

173
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,810
<i>When your lover leaves,</i>

174
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,334
<i>you feel like
you will never see them again.</i>

175
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:34,470
<i>And the sound of her tires
peeling out of my driveway,</i>

176
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,691
<i>I can tell she is in a hurry
to come back to me.</i>

177
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,048
Here you go, Debra.

178
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,092
Morning, Sheriff.

179
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,051
Hey, Deputy.

180
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,575
Hey, do you ever
get the feeling like--

181
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,751
like you're being followed?

182
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,014
Right now comes to mind.

183
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,408
Last night,
I felt someone following me.

184
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,062
So this morning,
I changed up my route,

185
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,891
but I think that son of a bitch
Joseph is still on my tail.

186
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,501
You know what this means,
don't you?

187
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,590
We're on the right track
with our investigation.

188
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,679
Our investigation? No.

189
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,290
I told you, when I get
involved, people get hurt.

190
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,291
I'm done.

191
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,249
What?

192
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,511
I thought you just needed time.

193
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,773
I don't need time.

194
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,470
I need distance.

195
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,821
Taking time helps you see
things more clearly, Deputy.

196
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:23,388
Hey, you know, Cletus peed
in my bed once, right?

197
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:25,303
Now, I got mad,
but did I get rid of him?

198
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,217
No.

199
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,610
I took some time to reflect

200
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,959
and find the right move.

201
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,613
So then I went and peed
in his little doggy bed,

202
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,310
and I said to him,
"Now, how do you like it now?"

203
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,747
That's how he learns.

204
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,444
They pee on you,
you pee on them.

205
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,141
I'm not gonna
rub his nose in it.

206
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,447
That'd just be cruel.

207
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:41,058
Not more cruel than me
listening to this story.

208
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,407
Hey.

209
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,932
Uh, I need to talk to you guys
about something.

210
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,281
I have had some complaints

211
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,587
regarding
the Sheriff's Department.

212
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,153
I told you
it was a terrible idea

213
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:50,851
to put up that suggestion box.

214
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,723
Yes, I got that from the note
you put in the suggestion box

215
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,465
telling me to take down
the suggestion box.

216
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:59,076
It seems certain constituents

217
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:01,209
aren't happy
about their taxpayer dollars

218
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,082
being wasted investigating
alien-related matters.

219
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,301
Taxpayers shouldn't
have a say

220
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,781
in how their tax dollars
are spent.

221
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,217
That's anarchy.

222
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,740
Well, some people
call it democracy.

223
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,785
Exactly.

224
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,438
This is a free country.

225
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,310
People can look for aliens
if they want,

226
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,052
or search the forest
for fairies,

227
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,793
even if they only find
a small frog

228
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,751
living in an old shotgun shell.

229
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,800
You said certain people
are lodging complaints.

230
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,975
I want to know who.

231
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,194
I am not at liberty to say.

232
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,369
Hi, Sheriff.

233
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,067
Nana.

234
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,678
Thank you, Mayor,
for our little talk.

235
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,334
Oh, come on, Liv.

236
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,293
How do you expect people
to take you seriously

237
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:45,209
with that crease
in your britches?

238
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,691
Ugh.

239
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,866
She's right.

240
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,651
I do have a crease.

241
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,740
How did she see that?

242
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,133
Sheriff, I'd like to see you
in my office.

243
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,526
Mm.

244
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:06,666
All right, Sheriff,
have a... seat.

245
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,019
I asked to see you
in my office.

246
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,194
No, you said

247
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,935
you'd like to see me
in your office.

248
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,240
And I don't blame you.

249
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,764
Hell, I'm a statue
of masculinity.

250
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,722
If I was in your office,
you'd probably walk in

251
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:23,160
every morning and say, "Damn,
now, that's what I want to be."

252
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,335
If you were a statue
in my office,

253
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,554
I'd hang my jacket on you.

254
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,208
I'd want you to,
because I'd be made

255
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,731
out of metal, and I'd be cold.

256
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,037
See?

257
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,865
Even as a statue man,
I still get what I want.

258
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,170
OK, here's the thing.

259
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,346
You and Liv have been
seen around town

260
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:38,741
snooping in plain clothes,
investigating something.

261
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,961
Not to mention, you know,
how you practically begged me

262
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:42,397
for a new deputy,
but now he's gone,

263
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:43,746
and you haven't even
replaced him?

264
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,139
What is going on?

265
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,401
Why are you being so secretive?

266
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,837
Why are you being
so inquisitive?

267
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,056
Because I have
a right to know.

268
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,666
This is my town.
- Oh, really?

269
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,450
You obviously don't know
how towns work.

270
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,843
You ever see a Western?

271
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,280
It's the sheriff that says,
"You're in my town now,"

272
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,804
not the mayor.

273
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,806
Do you drive a car
that has "mayor" written on it?

274
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:01,111
Yes, I do.

275
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,373
- You do?
- Yes.

276
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,332
Sometimes when it's dirty,

277
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,768
Max writes "mayor"
in the window,

278
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:06,900
and that's mayor,

279
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,556
as in "may your...

280
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,516
"town, if it is in trouble,

281
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,431
I will be the one to fix it."

282
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:19,564
You may have the word "sheriff"
on your car door,

283
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,479
but the name "Hawthorne"
is printed

284
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,698
on the soul of this town.

285
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,265
Right.
Like that poison creek.

286
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,266
Forget about the creek.

287
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,484
That's being renamed.

288
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,443
I don't know why
you're being like this.

289
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,923
You know, we used to be
like partners.

290
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,228
We were never partners.

291
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:33,535
We operate under
a split form of government,

292
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,711
like Madagascar or East Timor,

293
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,758
with two leaders
sharing separate powers, OK?

294
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,196
Now, if you don't mind,
I got work to do.

295
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,807
<i>Humans thrive on forming
connections to each other.</i>

296
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,027
<i>But when that connection

<i>They do not like that.</i>

299
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,599
<i>That is how I am
starting to feel.</i>

300
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,166

301
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,908

302
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:02,390

303
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,174
<i>or cozy lightweight jacket?</i>

304
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:14,402
Hello.

305
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,404
Oh.

306
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,322

Heather.

We can't keep doing
the notes.

338
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,141
It's not fair to Arlo.

339
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,533
He's freakin' exhausted.

340
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,231
My love, you came back.

341
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,929
No, Harry, it's over.

342
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,191
What?

343
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,410
But why?

344
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,892
Because I don't love you.

345
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,849
I never did.

346
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,111
No.

347
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,942
I don't believe you. Ah! Ow.

348
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,032
Why? Ow.

349
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,773
I think my heart is stopping.

350
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:05,992
It's not.

351
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,341
Hearts are the only thing
in the universe

352
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,865
that work even after
they break.

353
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,041
It's the thing that sucks
about hearts.

354
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,521
How do you know that?

355
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,089
Is it because your heart
is breaking too?

356
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,742
No.

357
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:18,787
My heart's fine.

358
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,310
Feels great.

359
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,921
Well, you cannot
take our love.

360
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,052
It is not just yours.

361
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:25,446
It is also mine.

362
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,100
I'm sorry, I have to go.

363
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,362
No, wait, I--

364
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:31,321
I have a--a poem to read you.

365
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,236
You have to listen.

366
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,938
It is titled
"Forever Together."

367
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,898
"Boy, I just
can't stop smiling."

368
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,900
- No, I can't do this.

369
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,554
I cannot do this.

370
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:48,860
Good--

371
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:54,997
Good what?

372
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,825
"Good"?

373
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,698
"Goodness, I love you."

374
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,831
"Good thing I was joking."

375
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,137
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

376
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,095
Huh?

377
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,407
"Bye."

378
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,021
"Goodbye."

379
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,157
Why?

380
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,862
Why?

381
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,124
Why?

382
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,804
Got you, son of a bitch.

383
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,199
Wait, you're not Joseph.

384
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,374
I--I'm Troy.

385
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,375
Troy?

386
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,506
Whoa.

387
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,942
Are you Lena's son?

388
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,205
I was just curious.

389
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,945
I wanted to see the guy
my mom was dating.

390
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,164
Come on, son.

391
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,078
You can't be
following people around

392
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,210
in the dark, all right?

393
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,820
It's dangerous.
And you can relax.

394
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,083
We're not dating.
We're just colleagues.

395
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,824
She doesn't talk about
her other colleagues

396
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:23,868
the way she talks about you.

397
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,740
She talks about me?

398
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,307
I overheard her
telling my Aunt Naya

399
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,699
you don't like her
paying for stuff?

400
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:29,874
I don't get it.

401
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,050
What's wrong with her paying?

402
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,052
Look, I appreciate
that you're here

403
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,140
to protect your mom, all right?

404
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,315
But this is grown man stuff.

405
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,968
You wouldn't understand.
It's complicated.

406
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,187
No, it's not.

407
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,102
From now on,
you stay away from her.

408
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,712
OK, well, she's already
staying away from me.

409
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:42,974
Why wouldn't she?

410
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,889
You made her cry.

411
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,675
What kind of a man are you?

412
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,120
Harry?

413
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:02,124
I got a text saying
you want to die,

414
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,126
followed by an emoji
of a skull,

415
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,128
then a noose, then a gun.

416
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,739
Yeah.
And then a knife and a casket.

417
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,785
Then for some reason, a church?

418
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,874
That was a mistake.

419
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:15,398
It was supposed to be a sword.

420
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:19,315
What's going on?

421
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,577
Heather left me.

422
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:21,839
Yes.

423
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,754
Yes, she did.

424
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,017
And that is awful.

425
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,367
She's gone.

426
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,411
It's over.

427
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,804
Now my life is over.

428
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,023
Oh, I'm so sorry, Harry.

429
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,721
Do not lie.

430
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,070
You're happy.

431
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,465
The red-haired one
is trying not to smile.

432
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,901
It seems like you know
my name by now.

433
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,424
OK.

434
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,122
Look, we did try
to break you guys up,

435
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,775
but it didn't work.
- Right.

436
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,429
So maybe it's just you.

437
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:49,606
Is that helping?

438
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,042
I...

439
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,957
You're wrong.

440
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,959
Heather loved me.

441
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,222
I loved her.

442
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,137
I don't know what happened.

443
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,444
Sometimes there is
no explanation.

444
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:02,445
Oh.

445
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,186
Hey.

446
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,971
You just need to get your mind
off her, you know.

447
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:09,104
Stay busy.

448
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:12,412
Focus on
your little project here.

449
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,805
Huh, what is it?

450
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:18,200
Some kind of alien bird feeder?

451
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,810
- It's a bomb.
- A bomb, you say.

452
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,116
What's that now?

453
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,205
I built it
for the general to use

454
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,643
on the Greys
after I left with Heather.

455
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,167
OK.

456
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,256
Well, saving the Earth,
that's something to live for.

457
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:33,041
I don't care about the Earth.

458
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,390
This place sucks.

459
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,652
I hate it here!

460
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:36,871
Uh!

461
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,135
Hey, Greys!

462
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,963
Come and take this Earth!

463
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:42,964
I don't want it!

464
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,618
You can have it!

465
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,316
Hey, take this stupid plant!

466
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,317
I don't want it!

467
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:49,188
You can have it!

468
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,233
Take this stupid chair!

469
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,147
Huh?

470
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,975
I don't care anymore!

471
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,803
- OK.
- Take me!

472
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,500
I want to die!

473
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,808
OK, will you come back
in here, please?

474
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,940
Maybe you'll feel better
if you eat something.

475
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,203
We got you a pizza.

476
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,292
I do not care
about your pizza.

477
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,424
I hate the Earth,
and I hate you.

478
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,904
Whoa!

479
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,341
That is not how I taught you
to behave.

480
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,345
Asta worked hard to pay
for that pizza, young man.

481
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:17,868
You will get your butt
out here and eat it.

482
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:20,044
I don't care, and I hate you!

483
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:21,307
I hate you more!

484
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,832
You know,
for the first time in my life,

485
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,703
I feel like I have
what it takes to be a mother.

486
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,625
I finally met Lena's son.

487
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,887
He's been tailing me.

488
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,890
He wanted to see
who his mom was dating.

489
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,677
Wanna talk about it?

490
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,287
Nah.

491
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,593
There's nothing to talk about.

492
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,074
She said we're colleagues,
but then I find out

493
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,642
she's been crying
over the breakup.

494
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,601
Seems like you want
to talk about it.

495
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:55,906
No, no.

496
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,430
This is our quiet time.

497
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,737
Quiet time.

498
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,740
You know,
maybe it's my destiny,

499
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,134
you know, to be alone.

500
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,964
OK.

501
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,618
Let's talk about it.

502
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,057
Her kid's right.

503
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:18,886
What kind of man
has somebody special

504
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,932
then just--
just pushes her away?

505
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:25,414
The kind of man
that lost his mom

506
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:29,113
when he was young
and raised by his father.

507
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:34,945
You got attached to these
notions of masculinity.

508
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,773
So take it easy on yourself.

509
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:37,905
It's not your fault.

510
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,301
Now can we fish?

511
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,780
You're the one
who wanted to talk.

512
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,963
He was serious about leaving.

513
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,313
This thing has
all the instructions

514
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,749
on what to do with this bomb.

515
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,099
Well, anything productive
is on hold for a bit.

516
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,144
He just asked
if men can be nuns.

517
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,798
Probably for the best.

518
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,800
I don't know if I want him
handling a bomb right now.

519
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,369
I am so tired of playing
parent to this alien child.

520
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,763
It's enough to do it at home.

521
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,331
Yeah.

522
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,377
What?

523
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,552
Nothing.

524
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,467
You're just not really
doing it at home.

525
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,469
I told you, Jay and I
are in a good place.

526
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,341
I don't want to ruin that.
- Right.

527
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,212
You're afraid to piss off
the teenager who lives with us

528
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,997
and eats my yogurt,
so now I have no yogurt.

529
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,564
I am not afraid.

530
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:29,696
Yes, you are.

531
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,088
You're afraid
you're gonna lose her.

532
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,091
And you're aiding
and abetting her.

533
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,397
Aiding and abetting?

534
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,008
What, is yogurt-eating
a felony now?

535
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,663
No, it's just,
you're trying to be

536
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:43,666
her friend instead of just
being a responsible adult.

537
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,495
If I'm so irresponsible,
why do you come running to me

538
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,757
every time you're in trouble?

539
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,672
Because you let me,
which might be

540
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,979
how this whole problem got
started, if I'm being honest.

541
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,284
Oh, oh, OK.

542
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,285
So I've ruined you
because I'm there for you

543
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,504
when you need me?

544
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,419
No, you're there for me
when it suits you,

545
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,855
when it makes you feel
better about yourself,

546
00:22:58,855 --> 00:22:59,856
like Harry said.

547
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,292
Thank you.

548
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,296
Tell me one time
that I was not there for you.

549
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,298
Oh, I don't know,
maybe when you drove me insane

550
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:08,865
by keeping
a life-altering secret from me

551
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:09,910
for a year and a half?

552
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,215
Oh, really? This again?

553
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,391
What was I supposed to do,

554
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,827
tell you the new doctor
is an alien?

555
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,263
Yes!

556
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,613
I'm supposed to be
your best friend,

557
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:18,875
but you couldn't
share that with me.

558
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,486
Why?

559
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,878
I'm not getting into this.

560
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,532
Well, we're in it.

561
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,229
Let's just drop it, please.

562
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,057
I don't want to drop it.

563
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:28,407
I want to know why.

564
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,104
Because you're
a loose cannon,

565
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,235
and I didn't know
if I could trust you.

566
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,846
Is that what you want to hear?

567
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,151
You are so impulsive,

568
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,284
I just knew that
you would tell someone.

569
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,242
That's bullshit.

570
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,679
You didn't want to tell me
because Harry

571
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,464
dropping down to Earth
was a godsend for you.

572
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,248
Just you.

573
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:45,902
Secret little baby
you found on your doorstep,

574
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,817
another one for your
menagerie of the needy.

575
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:50,080
You told Ben that
he was getting abducted

576
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,342
when I told you not to.

577
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,735
You did it anyway
because you don't listen

578
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,084
because you make everything
about yourself.

579
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,346
I do not.

580
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:56,391
How do I make everything
about myself?

581
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,653
Tell me. I want to know.

582
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,133
A lot of "I's" and "me's"
in that denial.

583
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,570
I told Ben
because real friends

584
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,703
don't keep huge secrets
from each other.

585
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:06,270
You told Ben
because you feel guilty,

586
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,055
and so you made everything
about you.

587
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,883
OK, fine. Fine.

588
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,188
I make everything about me.

589
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,886
But you make everything
about you

590
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,237
by saying it's not about you
because you're a martyr.

591
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,239
I'd rather be a martyr
than a loose cannon.

592
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,936
Well, that is exactly
what a martyr would say.

593
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,503
- Loose cannon.
- Martyr.

594
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,640
Pretend I'm not here.

595
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,060
Why are you here?

596
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,280
I came to see
how you're doing.

597
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,978
Were you getting dressed?

598
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,284
Undressed?

599
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:05,852
Or is this just how it is now?

600
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:08,550
Would you ask a woman that?

601
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,249
Your friend Asta
contacted me.

602
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,731
Said you're a mess
and can't work.

603
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,124
Now, I don't know
the first thing

604
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:19,909
about how to console
a lovesick alien,

605
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:23,217
but I heard about
your chicken girlfriend

606
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,219
or whatever she was.

607
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,655
So...

608
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:39,581
What the hell is that?

609
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,670
The guy said
her name is Patricia.

610
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,672
I thought maybe
she could help you

611
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,587
get over your girlfriend.

612
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,588
No judgment.

613
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,329
Everyone has their thing.

614
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,679
I am offended that you think

615
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,595
you can replace
the love of my life

616
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,641
with just some random bird.

617
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:56,772
No offense.

618
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,469
This has nothing
to do with you.

619
00:25:58,469 --> 00:25:59,862
You're very attractive.

620
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,211
Do whatever you need.

621
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,691
Just finish that bomb.

622
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,346
And don't fall in love.

623
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,956
She's a rental.

624
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:16,792
Don't worry, we don't
have to do anything.

625
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,318
We can just talk.

626
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:26,802
And even though I've never
had a UFO encounter myself,

627
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,370
I'm here
to support my daughter,

628
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,633
because I love her.

629
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,635
I love you too, Mom.

630
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,854
Oh, baby.

631
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:40,250
OK.

632
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,122
Thank you for sharing, Dorothy.

633
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:44,864
So this is where
all the crazies meet.

634
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,084
I expected there'd be
more padding on the walls.

635
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,831
- Hi.
- You came.

636
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,877
Yeah.
I was in the neighborhood,

637
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:59,139
so I figured I might as well.

638
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:01,532
You're new.

639
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,317
You want to tell us
a little about yourself

640
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:04,318
and why you're here?

641
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:05,667
Oh, me? No.

642
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,800
Um, I'm--I'm not here
to participate.

643
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,846
I'm--I'm just here to watch.

644
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,283
We don't get
a lot of watchers here.

645
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:17,287
Well, I--I haven't
experienced anything.

646
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,159
I mean, I--

647
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,684
I've been seeing this owl
outside my window.

648
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,990
But it's not a big deal.

649
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,688
I mean,
this is Colorado, right?

650
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,690
There are owls.

651
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,778
14 varieties, actually.

652
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,693
I--I looked it up online.

653
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,303
So, you know, no, I--

654
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,696
I think I'm good.

655
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,356
Except, um, I'm not--
I'm not good.

656
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,140
I'm...

657
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:51,887
I used to like where I live.

658
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:56,762
But now--I mean,
I love our--our home, but...

659
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,811
But I don't feel safe there.

660
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,031
I mean, I--I even--

661
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,816
I even tried to convince
my husband to sell our house.

662
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:11,080
But I--I think
it's bigger than that.

663
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,952
Like, I think
I'm not safe anywhere.

664
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:16,042
And I just feel like
I'm going crazy.

665
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,392
Oh, am I allowed to use
that word in here?

666
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:20,742
You're not crazy.

667
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,701
I've had a similar experience.

668
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,615
At first, the owls
didn't seem odd,

669
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,922
but then it just
kept happening.

670
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,924
I even put our house up
on the market.

671
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:31,057
And then one day,
I'm in the shower,

672
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,886
and I find this tiny bump
behind my knee

673
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,409
that I'd never noticed.

674
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:38,412
So I did some research,
and I realized

675
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:41,241
it's maybe a chip
they implanted in me,

676
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,982
and that people
all over the world

677
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:45,288
have been having
similar experiences.

678
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,597
Are you OK?

679
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,471
I don't know.

680
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,129
Does he have any idea
you were taking his DNA?

681
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,348
No.

682
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:02,610
I feel terrible, though.

683
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,785
I love him.

684
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,569
Oh, that's sweet.

685
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,615
You love your niece?

686
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:08,790
My knees?

687
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,618
You're gonna break my knees?

688
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:11,924
Niece.

689
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:13,969
Your niece, your sister's kid.
- OK.

690
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,492
Well, you could have
just said my sister.

691
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:16,493
I love her too.

692
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,936
Oh, snap.

693
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:25,894
Niece and knees,
very different.

694
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,243
How so?

695
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:32,683
Niece is a little girl
or a city in France.

696
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,381
I don't break knees.

697
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,296
I'm here on the scene,

698
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:40,126
watching Asta's boyfriend
and Harry's girlfriend

699
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:42,998
having a rendezvous.

700
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,827
Both of them sound like
my sister's girl child.

701
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,655
You have a niece
called knees?

702
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,049
Yeah. She's my niece.

703
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,877
How are we losing
to you people?

704
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:03,236
Shift reports
for you to sign.

705
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,846
Everything OK, Deputy?

706
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,979
You got your sad face on.

707
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,197
Really?

708
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,372
I have a sad face?

709
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:10,547
I'll give you a tip.

710
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,115
Here, put this pencil
in your mouth.

711
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,725
Sideways.

712
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,031
There you go.

713
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,859
You feel your smile muscles
stretching out?

714
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,600
See, when you're sad,
you fool your body

715
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,385
into thinking you're happy,
then you feel happy.

716
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,213
How long does it take?

717
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:25,519
Uh, seven minutes.

718
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,086
Of course, I'm a pro,
so I did it in three

719
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:29,262
using that very same pencil.

720
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,918
So tell me, Deputy,
what's got you down?

721
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,486
I went to one
of my meetings today.

722
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:39,185
And this woman, Linda,
brought her mom.

723
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:42,841
She just came
to support her daughter.

724
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,974
I never had
that kind of support,

725
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,628
and I probably never will.

726
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:48,716
Mm.

727
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,065
You know what?
Take a seat, Deputy.

728
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,850
I--I want to tell you
a story about this guy.

729
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,590
- Is this guy you?

730
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,765
Uh, doesn't matter.

731
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,593
Anyway, there's
this really handsome guy

732
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,421
that smells really good, right?

733
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,423
And he lost his mother
in his teens.

734
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,077
Now, his father--
- Lewis?

735
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,862
Can I finish telling you
the story about this guy?

736
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,733
- Yeah.
- OK, so his--his father,

737
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,344
he may have pushed
his notions of masculinity

738
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,172
on this guy
a little too hard, right?

739
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:13,436
And maybe if this guy would
have confronted his issues

740
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,047
earlier in life,
he wouldn't have

741
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,526
let his ego get the best of him

742
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,311
and pushed away
a perfectly good woman.

743
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,269
Is the woman Lena Torres?

744
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:22,097
Let's call her Meena Flores.

745
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,969
OK, look, my point is,

746
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,362
we're shaped by the people
who raise us.

747
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,974
And the people around you
weren't very supportive.

748
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,759
In fact, they actively
held you down.

749
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,501
Now, you are
the strongest person I know,

750
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,459
except when you're around
your Grandma Patty.

751
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,939
You need to stand up to her.

752
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,810
I can't.

753
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,292
She's mean and gives
deceptively powerful noogies.

754
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:47,079
Well, what if I told you
I knew a guy who'd go with you

755
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,038
and give you all the support
you've never had?

756
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:51,083
Is this guy you?

757
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,127
Ha!

758
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,302
You finally figured it out.

759
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,652
<i>♪ Took a vacay from</i>

760
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,089
<i>♪ The ways

761
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,874

762
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,661

763
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:06,141

764
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,751
<i>♪ I don't need more</i>

765
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,579
I'll give you
a lesson sometime.

766
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:10,667
Been trying
to get ahold of you,

767
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,060
but I see you were busy.

768
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,235
Dude, the snow was awesome.

769
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,715
You should have come with us.

770
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,065
Yeah, it must be nice
to take off work on a whim.

771
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,980
So impulsive, you know?

772
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,373
OK.

773
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,942
So what, you have a problem
with me snowboarding now?

774
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,030
Nope.

775
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,031
Where is Harry?

776
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,162
I don't know.

777
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,337
Last time I saw him,
I was with you.

778
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:29,338
Well, I went to the cabin,

779
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:30,339
and he isn't there.

780
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,645
All I found was a giant bird

781
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:32,994
who isn't Heather.

782
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,474
He definitely has a type.

783
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,780
OK.
Why are you looking for him?

784
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,000
Judy saw Joseph
talking to Heather.

785
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,697
What? Where?

786
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,003
<i>I'm here on the scene,
watching--</i>

787
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,092
Ignore the--
she had a filter on.

788
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:46,877
I can't hear
what they're saying.

789
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:48,270
What the hell?

790
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,011
Is the bird a spy
for the Greys?

791
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,013
We have to find Harry
and tell him.

792
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,537
I know where he goes
when he gets depressed.

793
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,411
Thanks for taking us
up the mountain, Steve.

794
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,760
Yeah, no problem.

795
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,718
I've gotta do a flyby
of the south peak anyway.

796
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,851
I think you and I have
to come clear it on Saturday.

797
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:04,983
Cool.

798
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,811
Avalanche control
is important, right?

799
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,988
Hey, are you concerned at all

800
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,294
that I'm some kind
of loose cannon

801
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:13,556
and that I'll go
up there with you

802
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,602
and just push you
off the mountain?

803
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,475
Um, no.

804
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,737
Ah.

805
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:21,738
So you don't think
I'm a loose cannon.

806
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,784
So you trust me.
Interesting.

807
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,178
Steve, don't you think
it's weird for someone

808
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,397
to give you shit for spending
time with your daughter?

809
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:29,529
I don't have a daughter.

810
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,617
Yeah, but don't you think,

811
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:31,966
after everything
you've been through,

812
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:33,054
you've earned the right
to hang out with her?

813
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,056
You know,
be a little more carefree.

814
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,841
Hey, Steve, do you think
painting the bathroom

815
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:39,756
a combination
of mauve and vomit

816
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,236
makes bath time enjoyable?

817
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:45,066
Steve, would you buy
a tiny coffee table

818
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,155
that's so small, it won't even
hold coffee table books?

819
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,939
We don't have
coffee table books.

820
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,593
Because the coffee table
is too small.

821
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:51,812
Oh, my God. I--

822
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,271
I can't knock.

823
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,446
I'm too nervous.

824
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,057
This always happens
when I come here.

825
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,580
It's OK.

826
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,364
You just got yourself
a little case of "shy-knuckle."

827
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:23,713
I'll be with you the whole way.

828
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:24,975
Go ahead, make a fist.

829
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,718
Ow.

830
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,546
I think they're
bleeding a little.

831
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,115
Liv. Sheriff.

832
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:35,290
What's going on?

833
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,728
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

834
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:41,122
And you couldn't just
send me an email?

835
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,907
Why did I bother
learning the internet

836
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:47,563
if you're just going
to show up in person?

837
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,001
All right, come in.

838
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:55,180
Wipe your feet.

839
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,052
It's not a flophouse.

840
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:05,625
Well, what is it?

841
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:10,673
You know
all that stuff you say

842
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,241
about my hair and my face

843
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,200
and pretty much
everything about me?

844
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,201
Yeah.

845
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,856
It--it feels kind of mean.

846
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:23,382
But it's probably
not your fault,

847
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,601
because I know your generation
has had it hard

848
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:28,474
with wars and everything,
and um,

849
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,867
I know you were born
in Great-grandpop's hay wagon.

850
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,609
Oh, you wanted to apologize.

851
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,045
OK, fine.

852
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:35,872
I forgive you.

853
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,439
Is that it?
- Yep.

854
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,963
Uh, wasn't there, uh--

855
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,965
wasn't there something else?

856
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,188
Ay-yi-yi.

857
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,842
OK, I admit,

858
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,323
I stole your
deviled egg recipe, Nana,

859
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,760
but it's only because
I admire your cooking,

860
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,718
and I admired you.

861
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:57,938
I wanted to be like you,

862
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,375
but then you trash-talked me
to the whole family.

863
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,030
And now you've said
all those awful things

864
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,553
about me in the town paper.

865
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:05,728
Why would you do that?

866
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,208
I just told the truth.

867
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,253
I always do.

868
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,906
Oh, really?

869
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,692
Well, I can do
some truth-telling too.

870
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,084
Oh.

871
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,348
Grandmothers are
supposed to be nice

872
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,088
and smell like cookies,

873
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:21,614
but you are cruel and vicious,
and you smell like vinegar.

874
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:24,573
And not that sweet balsamic
stuff that you dip bread in,

875
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,358
but that British
french fry vinegar.

876
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,881
OK, you're getting
a little off track.

877
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,404
Little girls
are supposed to be happy

878
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:31,841
to see their grandmas,
but I always dreaded it,

879
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,409
because you made me feel
small and worthless,

880
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:37,238
and I still feel that way,
but I'm not going to anymore,

881
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,935
because you're the one
who's small,

882
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:40,502
and you're the one
who's worthless.

883
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:41,895
Dial it back a little bit.

884
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,027
You are an old, angry
piece of---- -------,

885
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:46,247
and you can take that------ deviled egg----

886
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,902
and whip up some------ recipe
and-------

887
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:51,470
jam up it up your----------!

888
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,645
OK, all right.
That's enough.

889
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,255
No, no, no.
I'm just getting started.

890
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,304
She's faking it.

891
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:10,793
Gary said she'll be OK.

892
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,186
It's just a minor heart attack.

893
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:14,144
I mean, she looked pale
when we showed up,

894
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:17,104
so she was probably already
pre-heart attacking.

895
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:18,279
Thanks.

896
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,063
Also, I told Garrett
she's delusional.

897
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,979
So no one will believe
her side of the story.

898
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,938
I like living
in a small town.

899
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,461
Yeah.
You get your recipes?

900
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,376
Yeah.

901
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,595
Thanks for picking the lock.

902
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:30,639
Let's go.
We were never here.

903
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:39,360
No way.

904
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:47,934
<i>♪ If I could be,

909
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:06,169
What are you two doing here?

910
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,606
Heather's working
with Joseph.

911
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,609
It is bad enough
that she is gone.

912
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,828
Now you are spreading lies
about the woman

913
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:16,005
that I used to love
and now wish was dead.

914
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:18,225
It's not a lie, Harry.

915
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,923
Judy saw Heather
give Joseph a trash bag.

916
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:23,143
Do you know why?

917
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:25,928
Was it a blue trash bag?

918
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,408
Yeah.

919
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,063
She cleaned my gills
and put the gunk in there.

920
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,674
Do you know why she'd want
to give that stuff to Joseph?

921
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:35,111
My DNA.

922
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,852
They want to clone me.

923
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:40,465
They have my alien ball.

924
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:42,423
They're trying
to manipulate it.

925
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:46,514
But I gave it to Robert,
the alien tracker's son.

926
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,648
If the Greys kidnapped him,
then they have the ball.

927
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:51,650
You have reception here?
How?

928
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,477
It's very easy.

929
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:54,174
You just go into settings.

930
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,393
It will prompt you.

931
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,525
"Would you like to harness
the mountain

932
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,222
"to use as your own

00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:01,181
because you're
a brilliant alien?"

934
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,011
And you just push "yes."

935
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,708
So funny.

936
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,666
Hello, son.

937
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,973
It is Harry, your new father.

938
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,366
Uh, not the dead one.

939
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,063
Uh, how are you?

940
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,631
Are you still on Earth?

941
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,198
Yeah.

942
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:20,592
I'm at the malt shop
with the fellas.

943
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:24,378
The Greys have the ball.

944
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,467
What are they
gonna do with it?

945
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:29,470
Our technology is all
hydrogen-based.

946
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,516
It helps us manipulate water.

947
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:34,040
But if the Greys can do it,
they can speed up

948
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,824
their plans for the cavern
at Yellowstone.

949
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:38,697
Wait, so they could destroy
the Earth any time now?

950
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:40,525
Worse.

951
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:44,093
The love of my life
did not just leave me.

952
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:47,053
She betrayed me.
