1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,309
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,729
Food court? You sure they said food court?

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,024
I'm sorry, have my translation skills
been letting you down?

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,528
We don't know it's your kids.

5
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,821
Yes, we do.

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,042
- What is that?
There's something in there.

7
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,544
No!
- Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,838
Keep her talking.
Keep her awake, okay?

9
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,381
Jesus Christ.

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,236
Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake, stay awake.
Let's get her on this side, on this side.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,072
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
It's, uh...

12
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,075
You know, it's not actually that bad.
There was a...

13
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,285
The goalie on my soccer team,
Beth Wildfire,

14
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,496
this other girl slid into her leg,
and the bone came out of her knee,

15
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,873
- six inches or something, it was insane.
- Robin.

16
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,291
- Yeah?
- You're not helping.

17
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,793
- I'm sorry.

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,795
Okay. All right, El?

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,463
This is gonna hurt like hell, okay?

20
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,174
Okay.
Need you to stay real still.

21
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,676
Here, you're gonna want to bite down
on this, okay?

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,969
Jesus Christ.

23
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,808
Holy shit. Holy shit.

24
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,145
Do it.

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,146
Okay.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,700
Oh, shit.

27
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,588
- Jonathan!
- Stop talking!

28
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,802
- Goddamn it!
- No! Stop it!

29
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,637
Stop! Stop!

30
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,640
I can do it.

31
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,351
I can do it.

32
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,612
God!

33
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,156
God!

34
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,429
The Mind Flayer,
it built this monster in Hawkins,

35
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,557
to stop El, to kill her
and pave a way into our world.

36
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,477
And it almost did.
That was just one tiny piece of it.

37
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,020
How big is this thing?

38
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,024
- Thirty feet, at least.
Yeah.

39
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,943
It sorta destroyed your cabin.

40
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,695
Sorry.

41
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,780
Okay, so, just to be clear, this...

42
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,450
this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El,

43
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,537
it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?

44
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,039
- Yes.
- But instead of, like, screws and metal,

45
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,958
the Mind Flayer made its weapon...

46
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,543
with melted people.

47
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,420
- Yes, exactly.
Yeah, okay.

48
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,879
Iâ€” Yeah, I'm just making sure.

49
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,049
Are we sure this thing is still out there,
still alive?

50
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,927
El beat the shit out of it,
but, yeah, it's still alive.

51
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,555
- But if we close the gate againâ€”
- We cut the brain off from the body.

52
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,639
And kill it.

53
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,932
Theoretically.

54
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,018
Yoo-hoo!

55
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,770
Yoo-hoo!

56
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,025
Okay, this is what Alexei called
"the hub."

57
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,110
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.

58
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,695
Okay, where's the gate?

59
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,947
Right here.
I don't know the scale on this,

60
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,241
but I think it's fairly close
to the vault room,

61
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,035
maybe 50 feet or so.

62
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,328
More like 500.

63
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,206
What, you're just gonna waltz in there
like it's commie Disneyland or something?

64
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm sorry, who are you?

65
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,501
Erica Sinclair. Who are you?

66
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,794
Murray...

67
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,087
Bauman.

68
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,881
Listen, Mr. Bunman,

69
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,841
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do things,

70
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,927
but I've been down in that shithole
for 24 hours.

71
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,097
And with all due respect,
you do what this man tells you,

72
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,307
you're all gonna die.

73
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,061
I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old
speaking to me?

74
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,563
Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!

75
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,315
- Erica!
- Just the facts!

76
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,943
She's right. You're all gonna die,
but you don't have to. Excuse me.

77
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,570
- Sorry, may I?
- Please.

78
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,117
Okay, see this room here?
This is a storage facility.

79
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,245
There's a hatch in here that feeds
into their underground ventilation system.

80
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,415
That will lead you to the base
of the weapon.

81
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,917
It's a bit of a maze down there,

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,586
but between me and Erica,
we can show you the way.

83
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,213
You can show us the way?

84
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,924
Don't worry, you can do all the fighting
and the dangerous hero shit,

85
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,008
and we'll just be your...

86
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,885
navigators.

87
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,095
No.

88
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,723
Nope.

89
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,443
Well, that settles it.

90
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,821
He's gonna die. They're gonna die.

91
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,948
Yep, most likely.

92
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,074
You guys survived.

93
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,575
Barely.

94
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,661
We could've really used you guys
down there.

95
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,871
Could've used you up here, too.

96
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,207
Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.

97
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,626
Yeah. Big-time.

98
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,337
I missed you guys, too.

99
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,588
Big-time.

100
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,590
Please don't cry, nerds.

101
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,510
- Erica.
- Keep saying my name, see what happens.

102
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,222
Hey, heads up. You can navigate,
just from someplace safe.

103
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,099
- It's not that simple.
- The signal won't reach.

104
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,726
Not with this. You need something
with a high enough frequency band

105
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,311
to relay with the Russians' radio tower.

106
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,064
But for that to work, you need someone
who has both seen their comms room

107
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,900
and has access to a super-powered
handcrafted radio tower,

108
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,237
one preferably already situated
at the highest point in Hawkins.

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,155
Oh, wait.

110
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,489
That's me.

111
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,408
If you want us to navigate, you got us.

112
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,742
But we need a head start.

113
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,788
And a car.

114
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,212
Oh, man, now this...

115
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,131
this is what I'm talkin' about!

116
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,425
- "Toddfather"?
Oh, screw Todd!

117
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,843
Steve's her daddy now.

118
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,387
Did you just talk about yourself
in the third person?

119
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,223
- Did he just call himself daddy?
- All right, where are we going?

120
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,600
- Weathertop.
- Weather-what?

121
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,477
- Just drive.
- Okay. Jesus!

122
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,324
Bottom lock,

123
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,618
second-to-top lock,

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,578
third-to-top lock,

125
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,537
top lock.

126
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,706
Listen to me, I need to end this,

127
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,250
but I will be back before you know it,
okay?

128
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,712
- I don't know, Mom.
- No, listen. You're gonna be safe there.

129
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,797
It'sâ€” It's far away from all this.

130
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,551
You just stick close to your brother
andâ€” and do whatever he says.

131
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,886
No matter what. Okay?

132
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,805
I'm not worried about me, Mom,
I'm worried about you.

133
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,683
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine.

134
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,769
Okay? I'm gonna be fine.

135
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,855
Okay, Mom.

136
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,982
Okay, Mom. That's enough.

137
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,692
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Okay.

138
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,403
Mom, I can't breathe.

139
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,782
- My battery's low, but...
You're suffocating me.

140
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,951
it will recharge.

141
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,369
I know it will, kid.

142
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,620
I know.

143
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,205
I can fight.

144
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,874
Better than any of us.

145
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,085
But right now,

146
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,962
I need you safe.

147
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,465
This thing is after you.

148
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,842
It's not after me.

149
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,972
Do you understand?

150
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,724
Hey...

151
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,562
I need you to understand.

152
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,025
Okay?

153
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:28,943
Hey.

154
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,736
We should probably go.

155
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:52,925
Mike?

156
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,057
Be careful.

157
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,278
What?

158
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,199
It's a two-man operation. Two!

159
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,910
- Yeah, well, change of plans.
- Change of plans?

160
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,080
- Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please?
- We have two options here, Jim.

161
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,166
We can turn the machine off,
or we can explode it.

162
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,293
- Oh, yeah, says who?
- Says the man who built it!

163
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,087
- Yeah, and we wanna explode it!
- Or else our heroic efforts

164
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,005
will be for naught!

165
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,299
This is a three-man operation, Jim,
not two.

166
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,051
- Yeah, three.

167
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,305
El, you're bleeding.

168
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,431
Are you okay?

169
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,932
Yeah.

170
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,184
- Here.
- Okay.

171
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,571
- What's wrong?
- I don't...

172
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,239
I don't know.

173
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,952
You can't be serious. Come on!

174
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,454
Didn't your mom just buy this car?

175
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,164
Yes. I'm sure it's fine.

176
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,832
- Did you leave the lights on?
- No.

177
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,542
- Do we have gas?
- Yes!

178
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,129
- Come on!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop!

179
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,090
Pop the hood.

180
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,554
What the hell?
- What?

181
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,889
The ignition cable's gone.

182
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
Back in the mall!

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,034
Back in the mall!

184
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,203
Go! Go, go, go!
Be careful!

185
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,374
Go, go, go!

186
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,092
So then I yank those cables
like I'm pulling weeds.

187
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,344
- And that'll set off the alarmâ€”
- According to Alexei,

188
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,887
may his soul rest in peace.

189
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,683
Which should give you two an opening
to retrieve the keys from the vault.

190
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,019
And then we just follow the map
to the observation room, turn the keyâ€”

191
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,397
- Kaboom, we blow this sucker sky-high.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,275
And then, once the rift is closed,
we escape back through the vents.

193
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,735
Right under their commie noses.

194
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,777
Then home free.

195
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,695
Uh...

196
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,948
Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan
doesn't mean it was a bad plan.

197
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,575
I didn't say it was a bad plan.

198
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,784
You made a noise.

199
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,453
- I did not make a noise.
- You did too.

200
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,290
- I really think it's disrespectful...
- What is up with you and noises?

201
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,459
Children! Children!

202
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,085
It is a good plan.

203
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,256
A solid B, which is laudable,
given the situation and time constraints.

204
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,384
Dare I say, if it all goes right...

205
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,139
they'll never even know we were here.

206
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,016
Stop right there!

207
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,768
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

208
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,312
Documents, important documentsâ€”

209
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,688
for the Lieutenant-Comrade!

210
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,483
He called us, last minute.

211
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,110
Pardon our sloppy appearance.

212
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,112
Lieutenant? What Lieutenant?

213
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,656
Lieutenant...

214
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,617
Molotov?

215
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,920
Oh, shit.

216
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,213
Jim...

217
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,132
This is crazy.

218
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,302
- Oh, my God.
- Jim, I... This...

219
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,012
I had it under control.

220
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,305
Yeah, sure you did.

221
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,974
What are you doing?

222
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,976
I'm improvising.

223
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,273
Jesus, how far is this place, man?

224
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,067
Relax, we're almost there.

225
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,778
Suzie must be pretty special, huh?

226
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,071
I mean, if you built this thing

227
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,782
and lugged it all the way to the middle
of nowhere just to talk to her?

228
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,034
I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect,

229
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,036
but Suzie's about as close
to being perfect

230
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,663
as any human could possibly be.

231
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,790
She sound made-up to me.

232
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,375
She sound made-up to you?

233
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,879
- Why are you hesitating, Steve?
- I'mâ€” I'mâ€” I'm not! I'm not!

234
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,049
I think she sounds real.
You know, totally, absolutely real.

235
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,926
Left. Turn left.

236
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,845
- There's not a road here.
- Turn left now!

237
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,971
Jesus! Hang on!

238
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,142
Whoa! Henderson, where are we going?

239
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,143
Up!

240
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,228
Whoa!

241
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,442
- Oh, Jesus!
- We're not gonna make it!

242
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,695
Yes, we are. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby!

243
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,198
Come on!

244
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,950
Come on. Come on.

245
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,785
Come on!

246
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,080
Guess the Toddfather has its limitations.

247
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,177
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

248
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,764
- Scoops Troop, do you copy?

249
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,850
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

250
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,021
Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy?

251
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,274
We're trapped in the mall
and in need of emergency transportation.

252
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,069
Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Billy has found us.

253
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,864
He has disabled our car
and we are trapped in the mall.

254
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,701
Billy has disabled our car
and we are trapped in the mall.

255
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,745
- Scoops Troop...
- You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

256
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,872
This is just a precaution, okay?

257
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,540
And not just against Billy.

258
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,918
If he knows we're here,
so does the Mind Flayer.

259
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,504
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need
of emergency transportation.

260
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,256
- Do you copy?

261
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,966
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

262
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,260
No chance that thing'll drive, right?

263
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,554
Steve, do you copy?
- We don't need it to drive.

264
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,014
Dustin!

265
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,933
We just need the ignition cable.

266
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,484
Push!

267
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,281
Shit!

268
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,825
Let me try.

269
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,285
El...

270
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,874
I can do it.

271
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,836
Can I help?

272
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,587
Picking up.

273
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,548
Do I know you?

274
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,507
New arrivals.

275
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,134
Landed last night.

276
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,014
Say goodbye to sunlight.

277
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,598
Who needs sunlight

278
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,475
when we have one another, comrade?

279
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,394
Indeed, comrade!

280
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,479
And a bottle of Stolichnaya.

281
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,213
Why are you talking so much?

282
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,256
He was nice.

283
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,091
- He was nice?
- He was a nice guard.

284
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,927
Yeah, I mean, we should probably
invite him over after all this is done.

285
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,429
Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.

286
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,930
Get a six-pack,
share some laughs.

287
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,099
- You know, have a drink.

288
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,187
Ugh.

289
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,566
Anyone wanna trade jobs?

290
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,443
Bald Eagle, do you copy?

291
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,571
Bald Eagle, I repeat,
this is Scoops Troop, do you copy?

292
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,740
Yes, I copy.

293
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,742
Call sign?

294
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,495
Bald Eagle.

295
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,788
Please repeat.

296
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,083
- Bald Eagle. This is Bald Eagle!
Copy that.

297
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,293
Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle.
What's your 20?

298
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,922
We reached the vent.
I'll contact you when I need you.

299
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,299
Until then, silence.

300
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,383
Roger that, Bald Eagle.

301
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,345
This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent.
10-10, over.

302
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,848
I hate children.

303
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,608
- Remember, if anyone says anything, justâ€”
- Smile and nod.

304
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,443
Good luck.

305
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,620
Push!

306
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,628
All right, great.

307
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,339
All right, now, all the way. Ready?

308
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,551
Three, two, one... Push!

309
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,764
Told you.

310
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,099
Physics.

311
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:09,898
How do we get it open?

312
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,025
Uh, there should be a latch.
Check under the wheel.

313
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,821
You see it?
I don't know, hold on.

314
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,866
What's she doing?

315
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,064
Are you okay?

316
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,574
Do you see it?
- I don't know.

317
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,992
It should be right here.

318
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,620
Distributor, distributor...

319
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,262
Mike.

320
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,188
Got it.

321
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,106
Nancy!

322
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,903
Come on!

323
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,807
We just found them like this.

324
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,146
The American.

325
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,690
It's taking too long.

326
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,567
- It's fine.
- No, it's not. It is not.

327
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,819
She could've died back there.

328
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,028
She almost did.

329
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,239
Well, she's safe now.
She's on her way to Murray's.

330
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,782
That thing won't find her,

331
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,409
not before we kill it.

332
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,953
Hey. This isn't the way
this is supposed to work, all right?

333
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,039
You're supposed to say,
"Yes, I told you so.

334
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,874
That's why we needed to go back
to the kids."

335
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,293
Oh, yeah, and then
you say something like...

336
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,128
"Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen

337
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,381
when you make everything sound
like it's the end of the goddamn world."

338
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,264
You know...

339
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,393
I think, despite everything,
I mean, despite the arguing,

340
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,105
I think we make a pretty good team.

341
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,319
Well, we made it this far, didn't we?

342
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,196
Yeah.

343
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,240
We did.

344
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,493
We did.

345
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,246
So, uh...

346
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,667
did I get the job or what?

347
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,504
Ah, come on.

348
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,007
Detective Byers.

349
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,177
It has a ring, doesn't it?

350
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,768
It's kinda hard to serve in a town
where you don't live, Detective.

351
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,939
You're still moving outta here.
I mean, that is the plan, right?

352
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,108
Eh, we'll see how it goes.

353
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,444
"How it goes"? How what goes?

354
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,031
You know, ifâ€” if we actually do
make it out of here,

355
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,784
weâ€” we deserve to celebrate, right?

356
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,868
Yeah.

357
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,287
I mean...

358
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,290
yes.

359
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,751
Absolutely.

360
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,173
I hear Enzo's is pretty good.

361
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,179
What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock?

362
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,643
Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice
on Fridays.

363
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,355
Itâ€” It starts at 10:00,
so Iâ€” I can't be out late on a Friday.

364
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,315
Okay, well, how about 7:00, then?

365
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,566
7:00?

366
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,986
Enzo's, Friday, I meet you there?

367
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,488
No, you pick me up.

368
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,033
Picking you up, 7:00 p.m. Friday.

369
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,326
Yeah, it's a date.

370
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,380
Just for clarification, just because I...
I mean, just... If...

371
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,633
When you say "date,"
just so that we're crystal clear,

372
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,427
- so there's no confusionâ€” Yeah?
- Yeah, Hop?

373
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,178
Stop talking or I'm gonna change my mind.

374
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,555
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

375
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,181
Okay.

376
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,746
Scoops Troop, this is...

377
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,664
Hm.

378
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,416
Bald Eagle.

379
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,042
I've reached another junction.

380
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,919
This is what?
- The fourth junction.

381
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,547
All right, so if memory serves, this is
right after the My Little Pony thesis.

382
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,632
- We went left, so he has to go right.
- Right.

383
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,717
Fly right, Bald Eagle.

384
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,553
Fly right.
- Roger that, flying right.

385
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,472
Little shit.

386
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,600
What's the My Little Pony thesis?

387
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,018
Don't get him started.

388
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,270
- Get him started? Just tell meâ€”
- Hey, guys?

389
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,747
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop!
Do you copy? Over!

390
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,541
Griswold Family, I repeat,
this is Scoops Troop. Do youâ€”

391
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,711
Griswold Family, do you copy?

392
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,463
Do you copy?

393
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,138
Griswold Family,
this is Scoops Troop.

394
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,515
Please confirm your safety!

395
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,976
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop!
Please confirm your safety!

396
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,103
Are you en route to Bald Eagle's nest?

397
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,484
Please confirm your safety!

398
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,362
Someone, please just answer.
Is anyone there?

399
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,696
- Just answer!

400
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,574
- Anyone, please...

401
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,809
Griswold Family, do you copy?

402
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,852
Griswold Family, do you copy?

403
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,688
Griswold Family, do you copy?

404
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,482
Do you copy?

405
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,402
- Where are you going?
- To get them the hell outta there!

406
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,153
Stay here, contact the others!

407
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,572
- Shit.
- Wait, Robin!

408
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,408
Stay in touch.

409
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:17,993
Got it.

410
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,579
Bald Eagle, this is Scoops Troop.
What's your 20?

411
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,832
I told you, radio silence!

412
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,458
Yeah, but we have a problem.

413
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,752
What kind of problem?

414
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,632
It's turned away.
If we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.

415
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,508
- No way, not with El's leg.
- We have to try.

416
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,052
There's another way...

417
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,969
to get out.

418
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,304
Through the Gap.

419
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,559
Okay.

420
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,477
Now.

421
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,066
Bald Eagle has landed.

422
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,068
Repeat.

423
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,027
Bald Eagle

424
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,362
has landed.

425
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,200
Okay.

426
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,663
Come on, how much longer?

427
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,916
I don't know, I've never done this before!

428
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:33,962
Okay.

429
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,339
Okay, okay!

430
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,511
Get ready, lovebirds,
you're almost up to bat.

431
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,598
- Oh, shit.

432
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,690
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.

433
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,890
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

434
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,893
Let's go.

435
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,864
Let's go.

436
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,502
Did Mikhail send for you?

437
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,443
- All right.
- Okay.

438
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,237
- Give me the code.
- Okay.

439
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,239
Six-six-two,

440
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,574
six-oh-eight,

441
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,117
oh-oh-four.

442
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,710
Uh...

443
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,169
again?

444
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,130
Six-six-two,

445
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,173
six-oh-eight,

446
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,092
oh-oh-four.

447
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,143
Murray?

448
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,145
Your goddamn code...

449
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:38,938
is wrong.

450
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,815
What? Are you sure?

451
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,942
Yeah, I'm sure.

452
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,529
Well, Iâ€” I suppose it could be wrong.

453
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,323
How could it be wrong?

454
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,617
The code is a number,
a famous number.

455
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,869
Planck's constant
Iâ€” I thought I knew it.

456
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,704
- Planck's constant.

457
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,789
- You know it?
- Not by heart. You?

458
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,750
I'm not a nerd, nerd.

459
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,003
He told me it was
Planck's constant, which I know.

460
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,631
Why would I need him to give me a number
I already know?

461
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,717
What are you doing?

462
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,637
Go, go, go!

463
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,231
- Shit.
- Get the car started. Go!

464
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,908
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

465
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,038
- Come on.
- We gotta go!

466
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,667
Come on!

467
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,299
We gotta go!

468
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,441
Are you okay?

469
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,068
Ask me tomorrow?

470
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,491
Oh, shit!

471
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,418
Get in!

472
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,880
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

473
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,873
Suzie, do you copy?

474
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,751
Suzie, do you copy?

475
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,086
This is Suzie. I copy.

476
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,130
- Suzie!
- Dusty-bun?

477
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,214
"Dusty-bun"?

478
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,215
Where have you been?

479
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,469
I'm so, so sorry.
Iâ€” I've been really busy...

480
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,889
uh, trying to save the world
from Russians and monsters.

481
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,849
Of course you have.

482
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,851
Get the goddamn number already!

483
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,478
Who was that?

484
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,812
It was...

485
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,066
Uh, I don't know, actually.
I think it was just some interference.

486
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,984
So, why don't we, uh, change frequency

487
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,528
to 14.158?

488
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,739
Copy that, shifting frequency. Standby.

489
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,001
Dusty-bun, you copy?
- I copy, Suzie-poo.

490
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,795
It sounds much better now, thanks.

491
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,630
Suzie.
- Okay, so, listen,

492
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,173
do you know Planck's constant?

493
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,008
Do you know the Earth orbits the sun?

494
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,179
Okay, so I know it starts
with two sixes, and then a...

495
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,388
W-What is it?

496
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,892
Okay, let me just be clear on this.
I haven't heard from you in a week,

497
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,354
and now you want a mathematical equation
that you should know

498
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,439
so you can... save the world?

499
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,649
Suzie-poo, I promise,

500
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,567
I will make it up to you
as soon as possible.

501
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,486
You can make it up to me now.

502
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,947
- What?
- I want to hear it.

503
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,283
- Not right now.
- Yes, now, Dusty-bun.

504
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,119
Suzie-poo, this is urgent.

505
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,247
Yes, yes, you're saving the world,
I heard you the first time,

506
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,208
but Ged is also saving Earthsea
and he's about to confront the shadow,

507
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,127
so this is Suzie, signing off.

508
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,294
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.

509
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,963
Okay. Okay.

510
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,340
Shit.

511
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:01,802
Planck's constant is 6.62607004.

512
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,024
You just saved the world.

513
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,526
Gosh, I miss you, Dusty-bun.

514
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,278
And I miss you more, Suzie-poo.

515
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,031
I miss you more,
multiplied by all the stars in our galaxy.

516
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,115
No, I miss youâ€”

517
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,116
Enough.

518
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,601
- Shit!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

519
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,909
It's turning around.

520
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,828
- What?
- It's turning around!

521
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,037
Maybe we wore it out.

522
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,872
I don't think so. Hold on.

523
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,367
Hey! Everybody out.

524
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,830
Everybody out!

525
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,304
Hey.

526
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,557
You ready to end this?

527
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,235
In here. In here.

528
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,197
Okay. Come on, come on, come on...

529
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,329
Billy.

530
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,416
Billy, you don't have to do this.

531
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,377
Billy. Your name's Billy, Billy Hargrove.

532
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,838
You live on 4819 Cherry Lane.
Billy, please, I'm Max, I'm yourâ€”

533
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,529
Murray, you all set down there?

534
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,491
All set, but I've got some company
which I'd love you to obliterate.

535
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,159
Will do. Hang tight.

536
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:17,957
On three.

537
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,166
On three.

538
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,501
One...

539
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:22,878
Twoâ€”

540
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,770
The Americans,

541
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,105
I've found themâ€”

542
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,871
Don't be afraid.

543
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,248
It'll be over soon.

544
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,253
Just try and stay... very still.

545
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,077
Flay this, you ugly piece of shit!

546
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,443
- We're almost out!
- I know!

547
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,322
Dustin! We're out of time!

548
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,616
Hurry! Close it now!

549
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,034
Close it!

550
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,301
Come on!

551
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:46,975
Mike...

552
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,018
Mike.

553
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,478
Mike.

554
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,482
Mike. Mike. Mike, get up.
Mike, can you hear me? Mike! Mike!

555
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,984
Hey, come on.

556
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,530
You okay?

557
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:03,992
Where's El?

558
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,633
Leave me alone!
- Stop it!

559
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,427
- Mom!
This is your new sister.

560
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,011
at least seven feet.

561
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,683
Seven... feet.

562
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,146
You told her...

563
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,607
the wave was seven feet.

564
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,528
Woo!

565
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,822
Yeah!

566
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,828
You ran to her, on the beach.

567
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,210
There were seagulls.

568
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,385
She wore a hat...

569
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,679
with a blue ribbon.

570
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,974
A long dress...

571
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,771
with a blue and red flower.

572
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,317
Yellâ€” Yellow sandals,

573
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,486
covered in sand.

574
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,367
She was pretty.

575
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,375
She was really pretty.

576
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,171
And you...

577
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,715
you were happy.

578
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,047
I'll see you in hell!

579
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,394
Hit me.

580
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,402
We're out!

581
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,070
Damn it!

582
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,228
No!

583
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,383
Close it now!

584
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,302
Close it!

585
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,265
Billy!

586
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,274
- El.
- Mike!

587
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,156
Billy?

588
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,408
Billy.

589
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,453
Billy, Billy, get up, please.
Billy, get up, please, please.

590
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,538
- I'm sorry.
- Billy...

591
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,043
Billy. Billy.

592
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,879
Billy, wake up. Billy, get up.
Please, Billy...

593
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,174
Billy!

594
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,427
Billy...

595
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,930
Billy...

596
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,557
- I'm sorry.

597
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,101
It's okay. It's okay.

598
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,353
It's okay. It's okay.

599
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,581
Hop.

600
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,049
Jim. Where's Jim?

601
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,227
Let's go! Go! Come on!

602
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,990
You all right?

603
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,325
Hands up!

604
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,703
Don't shoot! American!
We're Americans! Americans!

605
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,170
Hey, come on, let's go!

606
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,422
Go, go!

607
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,579
Thank God!

608
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,396
Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana,

609
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,814
a wonderful place to grow up,

610
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,025
to raise your family,

611
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,651
to walk your dog.

612
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,153
- But then...

613
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,782
on July Fourth,
everything changed.

614
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,451
A terrible tragedy struck
this small town.

615
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,623
But this was not this small town's
first brush with tragedy.

616
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,918
Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups,

617
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,253
a bizarre chemical leak.

618
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,463
Is it all linked?

619
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,007
All a vast conspiracy?

620
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,093
The fault of a disgraced,
corrupt mayor?

621
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,262
Or is something more going on
in the heartland?

622
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,890
- Can a town itself be cursed?

623
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,142
Some believe a rise in Satanism
is to blame.

624
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,186
- To find out,

625
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,731
tune in tonight at 8:00 p.m.
for "Horror in the Heartland"

626
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,483
on Cutting Edge.

627
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,907
You put your mom down as a reference?

628
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,743
Yeah. Why not?
She's, like, super well-respected.

629
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,538
You're such a dingus.

630
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:57,872
Whaâ€”

631
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,792
Uh, just to be clear,
we weren't fired, you know.

632
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,045
The mall burned down and, like,
killed a bunch of people.

633
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,007
Thanks for sharing.
Didn't know.

634
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,718
Three favorite movies. Go.

635
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,929
Uh... The Apartment,

636
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,432
Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise.

637
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,558
You, go.

638
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,685
- Favorite movies?
- Did I stutter?

639
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,187
- Uh... Animal House, for sure.

640
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,522
Um...

641
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,441
Eyes on me, Harrington.

642
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,234
Yeah. Uh...

643
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,361
Star Wars.

644
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,487
A New Hope?

645
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,447
A new what-now?

646
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,490
Which Star Wars?

647
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,034
The one with the teddy bears. Duh.

648
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,413
No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out.
The movie that just came out.

649
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,790
The one with the DeLorean
and Alex P. Keaton,

650
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,792
and he's trying to bang his mom.

651
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,127
The time...

652
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,629
Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.

653
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,840
You start Monday.

654
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,509
You start never.

655
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,431
Will you just, um...
Will you give us a minute?

656
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,474
Why?

657
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,558
Steve.

658
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,398
All right, you have to understand, Keith,

659
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,650
I know his taste is a bit pedestrian,

660
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,236
but the dingus has other qualities.

661
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,615
He's a douchebag of the highest order,
Robin.

662
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,576
He was a bit of a prick to us
in high school, I'll grant you that,

663
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,827
but he remains...

664
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,662
a total chick magnet.

665
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,373
Yeah, okay,
and this is relevant to me how?

666
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,626
Uh, Earth to Keith.

667
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,128
The ladies will come in just to see him.

668
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,546
They'll come in in droves.

669
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,173
Droves, Keith.

670
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,966
We sold so much ice cream,

671
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,177
they had to get a second shipment in
from Michigan.

672
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,429
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.

673
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,097
And these ladies...

674
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,974
These ladies are hot.

675
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,977
They're so very hot.

676
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,647
And there are too many of them
for little Steve.

677
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,315
He needs assistance.

678
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,235
He needs your assistance, Keith.

679
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,073
What's in it for you?
You got a thing for him or something?

680
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,368
Goddammit. This isâ€”

681
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,203
Hm.

682
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,039
We're just, um...

683
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:04,999
We're just friends.

684
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,459
Oh!

685
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,837
Fast Times. Fast Times. Ever heard of it?

686
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,381
- Top three for me, Keith.

687
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,759
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.
- Sorry. Sorry.

688
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,053
- Still got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

689
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,955
Wait, did we get that verse right?
It's "unfold behind the clouds"?

690
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,624
Yeah, but you're butchering it,
so could you please stop?

691
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,751
So then join in, Dusty-bun.

692
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,920
Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun,
why don't you join us?

693
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,339
You guys are so funny,
you should be on Carson.

694
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,300
- Can't we just hear your rendition?
- No.

695
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,467
Please? Just one verse?

696
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:00,722
No. No way. It's reserved for Suzie's ears
and Suzie's ears alone.

697
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,779
Shut up, you guys.

698
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,326
Stop! You guys, please, shut up.

699
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,829
Whoa, dude. That's the donation box.

700
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,206
I know.
I'll just use yours when I come back.

701
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,792
I mean, if we still wanna play.

702
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,795
Yeah, but what if you want to join
another party?

703
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,672
Not possible.

704
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,265
Is that...

705
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,185
everything?

706
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,854
I guess so.

707
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,575
Seventeen years of my life...

708
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,869
packed up in one day.

709
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,635
What if I just...

710
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,970
don't let you go?

711
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,849
I think...

712
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,019
the new owners might kick us out.

713
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,400
You could stay in our basement.

714
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,111
Your dad'd love that.

715
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,780
We could hide you in a tent,

716
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,532
like El.

717
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,122
Hey.

718
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,834
It's gonna be okay.

719
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,468
As a wise man once said...

720
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,847
we've got shared trauma.

721
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,977
So what's a little more, right?

722
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,237
What's a little more?

723
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:14,999
They'll come back.

724
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,834
I know they will.

725
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,173
Thanks.

726
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,217
- You packed your walkie, right?
- Yes.

727
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,636
Because you know that I'm gonna
steal Cerebro from Dustin

728
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,222
and call you so much,
you're gonna have to turn it off, right?

729
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,684
Did you talk to your mom?

730
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,520
About Thanksgiving?

731
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,855
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the okay. I'll be there.

732
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,442
And then I was thinking maybe
you could come up here for Christmas.

733
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,610
And Will, too.

734
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,446
You can come before or after Christmas,
or whatever Mrs. Byers wants,

735
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,907
but I was thinking Christmas Day
could be super fun,

736
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,701
because we'd all have cool new presents
to play with and, uh...

737
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,331
Sorry, that made me sound like
a seven-year-old.

738
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,084
I like presents, too.

739
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,710
Yeah, cool. Yeah.

740
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,171
I likeâ€” I like presents, too.

741
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,382
Cool.

742
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,351
Mike?

743
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:16,853
Yeah?

744
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,773
Remember that day...

745
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,069
at the cabin, you were talking to Max?

746
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,153
Um...

747
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,697
I don't think I follow.

748
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,907
You talked about yourâ€” your feelings,

749
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:31,409
your heart.

750
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,326
Oh.

751
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,705
Oh, yeah, that.
Man, that was so long ago. Um...

752
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:40,501
That was really heat of the moment stuff,
and we were arguing and...

753
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,420
I don't really remember...

754
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,047
What did I say, exactly?

755
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,049
Mike...

756
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,390
I love you, too.

757
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,633
Donation box?

758
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,468
Uh, yeah, sure.

759
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,680
What is that?

760
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,432
Uh...

761
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,063
Itâ€” It's the speech Hop wrote
for you and Mike.

762
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,564
Speech?

763
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,192
Yeah. You know, the heart-to-heart.

764
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,322
He never talked to you, did he?

765
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,245
Can I read?

766
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,552
"There's something I've been
wanting to talk to you both about.

767
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,390
I know this is a difficult conversation,

768
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,226
but I care about you both very much.

769
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,437
And I know that you care about each other
very much.

770
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,191
And that's why it's important that
we set these boundaries moving forward,

771
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,360
so we can build an environment...

772
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,865
where we all feel...

773
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,868
comfortable...

774
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:40,746
trusted...

775
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,582
and open...

776
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,170
to sharing our feelings."

777
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,635
Feelings.

778
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,815
Feelings.

779
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,651
Jesus.

780
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,612
The truth is,

781
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:18,409
for so long,
I'd forgotten what those even were.

782
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,996
I've been stuck in one place,

783
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,206
in a cave, you might say.

784
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,459
A deep, dark cave.

785
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,504
And then,
I left some Eggos out in the woods,

786
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,673
and you came into my life and...

787
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,594
for the first time in a long time,

788
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,057
I started to feel things again.

789
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,101
I started to feel happy.

790
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,275
But, lately, I guess I've been feeling...

791
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,403
distant from you.

792
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,822
Like you're...

793
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,117
you're pulling away from me or something.

794
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,412
I miss playing board games every night,

795
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:09,085
making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas
at sunrise,

796
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:12,379
watching westerns together
before we doze off.

797
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,800
But I know you're getting older.

798
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,427
Growing.

799
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,346
Changing.

800
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,182
And I guess...

801
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,935
if I'm being really honest,

802
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,312
that's what scares me.

803
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,358
I don't want things to change.

804
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,823
So, I think maybe that's why
I came in here,

805
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:42,076
to try to maybe... stop that change.

806
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,496
To turn back the clock.

807
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,667
To make things go back
to how they were.

808
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,173
But I know that's naive.

809
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,050
It's just...

810
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,678
not how life works.

811
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,763
It's moving.

812
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,058
Always moving, whether you like it or not.

813
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,230
And, yeah, sometimes it's painful.

814
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,858
Sometimes it's sad.

815
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,902
And sometimes...

816
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,446
it's surprising.

817
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:21,907
Happy.

818
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,411
So, you know what?

819
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,746
Keep on growing up, kid.

820
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,457
Don't let me stop you.

821
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,044
Make mistakes, learn from 'em,

822
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,965
and when life hurts you,
because it will,

823
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,384
remember the hurt.

824
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,096
The hurt is good.

825
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:47,224
It means you're out of that cave.

826
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,145
But, please,

827
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,606
if you don't mind,

828
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,109
for the sake of your poor old dad,

829
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:01,864
keep the door open three inches.

830
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,343
Are you okay?

831
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:26,764
Yeah.

832
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,061
Time to go?

833
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,688
Yeah.

834
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,399
I'll be out in a minute.

835
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:39,818
Okay.

836
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,948
No. Not the American.

837
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,832
No, I'm begging you...
No! Don't!

838
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:02,711
No! Please! No! Don't!

839
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,672
No, don't!

840
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,800
Don't do this!

841
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,219
Let me go!

842
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,096
Let me go!

843
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,030
Don't leave me in here.

844
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,741
Let me out,

845
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:33,826
I'm innocent.

846
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,327
I'm innocent!

847
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:36,703
I'm begging you, please!
