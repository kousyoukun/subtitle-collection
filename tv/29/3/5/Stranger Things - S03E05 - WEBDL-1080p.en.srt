1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,017
Shit! Shit!

2
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,227
We're going down! We're going down!

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,895
Yeah, no shit, Harrington!

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,231
- Why don't these buttons work?

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,025
Press the button!

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,651
What do you think I'm doing?

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,029
Come on, press something!
Just press the button!

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,488
Push it!

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,993
My groin.

10
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,411
It fell on my groin.

11
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,579
Dustin!

12
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,205
- Get this off of me!

13
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,208
I can't move.

14
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,211
Is everyone okay?

15
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,089
Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that
Russians can't design elevators!

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
I think we've clearly established
that those buttons don't work.

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,552
They're buttons.
They have to do something.

18
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,095
Yeah, if we had a keycard.

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,014
- A what?
- It's an electronic lock.

20
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,266
Same as the loading dock door.
If we don't have a keycard,

21
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,393
- it won't operate, meaning—
- We're stuck in here.

22
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,311
Yeah.

23
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,897
Just so you nerds are aware,

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,983
I'm supposed to be spending the night
at Tina's,

25
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,110
and Tina always covers for me.

26
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,280
But if I'm not home
for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow

27
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,283
and my mom finds out
you three are responsible,

28
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:19,245
she's gonna hunt you down, one by one,
and slit your throat.

29
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,289
I don't care about Tina!

30
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,458
Or Uncle Jack's party!

31
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:28,004
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us
if we're dead in a Russian elevator!

32
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,048
Hey.

33
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,884
What if we climbed out?

34
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,859
What were you saying about climbing?

35
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,845
Looks like somebody's home.

36
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,288
Did you hear that?

37
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,368
Where's that coming from?

38
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,129
It's below us.

39
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,884
Hey, dipshits!

40
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,847
Hawkins PD. Hands in the air.

41
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,852
Don't make me say it again!

42
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,233
English.

43
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,776
You speak English?

44
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,863
I can't understand you!

45
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,367
I can't understand you.

46
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,369
- No understand!

47
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,037
- Hopper!

48
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,004
Don't move!

49
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,131
Drop the gun.

50
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,716
Drop it!

51
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,677
You understand what I'm saying, big guy?

52
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,679
Drop the weapon.

53
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,847
Or what?

54
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,808
You going to shoot?

55
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
Good.

56
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,605
So you do understand
what I'm saying, huh?

57
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,814
And, yeah,

58
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,109
you don't put that thing away,
I'm gonna blow some daylight

59
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,861
into that thick skull of yours.

60
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,820
No.

61
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,781
You won't do that.

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,574
Why's that?

63
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,493
Because you are policeman.

64
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,579
Policemen have rules.

65
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,622
Oh, yeah?

66
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,209
Wanna test that theory?

67
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,252
I'm gonna count to three.

68
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,796
One,

69
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,756
two,

70
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,257
three!

71
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,834
Hopper!

72
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,463
- Oh, shit.

73
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,423
Go!

74
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,262
Move, Joyce!

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,472
Oh, God.
Come on, Smirnoff.

76
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,391
You're coming with us!

77
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,156
Let's go! Let's go!

78
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,158
Move it, Smirnoff! Move it!

79
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,159
Run!

80
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,663
Joyce! Drive!

81
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,459
- Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around!
- Are you kidding me?

82
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,797
- Shit!
Go!

83
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,882
Joyce, drive.

84
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,259
- I'm trying!
- Joyce, please, drive!

85
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,178
Drive!

86
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,807
Get us outta here!

87
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,325
Oh, God!

88
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,827
Hang on!

89
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,336
Still think it was our government?

90
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,518
God, shut up!

91
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,282
- Hello?
- Jonathan.

92
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,159
Do you realize what time it is?

93
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,452
Listen to me, okay?

94
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:24,040
It's 6:00 a.m. And, uh, I had a late night
with Fagin and the gang, so—

95
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,375
- I'm at the hospital with Driscoll.
- What?

96
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,919
She's been sedated for a few hours
and the doctors are still running tests.

97
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,463
Nancy, please tell me you're joking.

98
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,257
It's not a joke.
And, yes, I know I'm insane

99
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,760
and irrational and out of touch,
but can you save your lecture,

100
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,970
because I really don't give a shit
right now. I just...

101
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,432
I need you to put me on the phone

102
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,350
with your brother.

103
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,060
- What?
- Jonathan...

104
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,603
Please.

105
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,021
Uh...

106
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,357
He's not even here.

107
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,441
Where is he?

108
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,984
Is he safe?

109
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,819
Why wouldn't he be safe?

110
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,529
Nancy?

111
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,865
Why wouldn't he be safe?

112
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,079
Son of a bitch.

113
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,290
Son of a bitch!

114
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,253
Okay, a magnet? Magnets?

115
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,382
- Do you know "magnet"? Magnet?
Magnit.

116
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,633
Yes, magnit.

117
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,426
Okay, so, uh, magnit...

118
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,053
on my— my fridge,

119
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,554
my icebox, and then they...

120
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,348
they fell.

121
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,309
They demagnetized, stopped working.
Uh, do you understand?

122
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,227
Da.

123
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,106
Okay, so is that because of the machines
that you're working on?

124
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191
- Machina.
- Machina, machina, yes.

125
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,360
Da, da, machina.

126
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,320
- Machina, machina!
- Yes, machina—

127
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,321
Vroom, vroom.

128
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,156
Oh, not— not the car.

129
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,575
The machines at Hess Farm where—

130
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,036
- where we kidnapped you—
- Joyce, please!

131
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
You're givin' me a headache, both of you!

132
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,915
Hold on, please. One minute.

133
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,999
Hey.

134
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,751
I am making progress.

135
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,211
- Progress.
- Yeah.

136
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,839
What have you learned, huh?
You learned that Smirnoff over there—

137
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,299
Alexei.
- Smirnoff is Russian

138
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,926
and works for Starcourt,

139
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,219
two things we already knew.

140
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,137
Thought we knew.

141
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,098
But now we know-know,
because I've confirmed them.

142
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,182
You're welcome.

143
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,769
Yeah? Why don't you confirm
whether this baby'll start, huh?

144
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,814
Keep it in park, please.
- Yeah, duh!

145
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,024
You do— do something useful.

146
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,026
- You do something useful.

147
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,535
It's not working.

148
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,412
Try it again.

149
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,123
Shit.

150
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,048
Stop, stop!

151
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,216
Shut up, Smirnoff!

152
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,762
Aw, come on! D'you hear me?

153
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,263
I said shut your damn—

154
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,016
Shit!

155
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,267
Oh, Jesus.

156
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,729
Whoa!

157
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,984
Stop.

158
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,864
I thought this friend of yours
lived in Illinois.

159
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,283
He's not really a friend.
He's more like an acquaintance.

160
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,576
Oh? Okay, well—

161
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,370
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep up, keep up, keep up.

162
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,747
- Easy.

163
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,041
Okay, so this acquaintance...

164
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,794
- lives in Illinois? Correct?
Yeah, yeah.

165
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,754
So we're walking to Illinois?

166
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,756
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.

167
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,133
You know, I figure we'll get there
by, like, Friday evening.

168
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,385
I hope that works for your schedule.
Jesus Christ, Joyce.

169
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,055
- We're not walking to Illinois, okay?
- Well, then what are we doing?

170
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,097
I don't know, okay?

171
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,350
I will— I will figure something out.

172
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,478
Isn't there someone in Indiana
who speaks Russian that—

173
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,563
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.

174
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,481
I'm all ears.

175
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,398
I'm all ears!

176
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,526
I mean, fine.

177
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,110
Just saying.

178
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,195
Gah!

179
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,404
Ugh!

180
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,407
Gah!

181
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,042
Damn it.

182
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,003
I found him.

183
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,964
Where is he?

184
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,466
Woods.

185
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,926
- Woods?

186
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,011
He's with... Will's mom.

187
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,680
My— My mom?

188
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,515
What are they doing?

189
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,392
Ill... annoy.

190
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,562
They're going to Ill-annoy.

191
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,355
Mike! Breakfast!

192
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,731
Not now, Mom!

193
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,442
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?

194
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,152
The state of Illinois?

195
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,488
Ill-annoy.

196
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,749
Does it still hurt?

197
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,210
Only when I talk.

198
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,921
Well, it's a good thing
you're not Mike, then.

199
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,799
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
And you'd be in constant pain.

200
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,096
Something's not right.
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer,

201
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,807
now all of a sudden,
he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?

202
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,350
And Dustin's MIA, too?

203
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,311
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.

204
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,437
What does it matter?

205
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,731
The bottom line is, they're not here.

206
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,734
- It's up to us.
- Up to us to do what exactly?

207
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,360
Find Billy and stop him.

208
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,195
Okay, yeah,
that's a really nice sentiment,

209
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,616
but even if El could find him again,
and that's a pretty big if, then what?

210
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,410
We burn the shit out of him
and make sure he doesn't escape this time.

211
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,245
- Okay, then what?
- Then we win.

212
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,872
No, see, that's the problem.

213
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,874
We don't. We don't win.

214
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,627
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before
and he just came right back.

215
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,546
We don't just have to stop Billy,
we have to stop the Mind Flayer.

216
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,465
- How in the hell do we do that?
- I don't know.

217
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,674
Maybe El does.

218
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,221
What are they still doing in there?

219
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,016
I don't know.

220
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,435
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.

221
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,479
Why?

222
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,024
- I mean, I don't know.
- They're conspiring against me.

223
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,818
- That's what you're concerned about now?
- It's not my main concern.

224
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,112
- It's just a sub-concern.
- I thought it was already over.

225
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,365
It's not over, okay?
We're just taking a break.

226
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,991
She said she dumped your ass.

227
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,202
- That doesn't sound like a break.
It wasn't!

228
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,164
You guys do realize we can still hear
everything you're saying, right?

229
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,042
Conspiring.

230
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,002
- I told you, they're conspiring.

231
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,712
Not now, Mom!

232
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,464
Mike, open the door.

233
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,637
Code red, I repeat, code red.

234
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,013
Does anyone copy?

235
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,683
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.

236
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,353
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
Does anyone copy?

237
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,147
We are innocent children
and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.

238
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,234
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins,
and if we are found,

239
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,902
they will torture and kill us.

240
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
Gotta take it easy on that thing.
Gonna drain the battery.

241
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,032
- The mall just opened.
- So?

242
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,575
So someone could be in range.

243
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,412
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop
is gonna rappel down here

244
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,496
and save the day?

245
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,206
All right, why are you such a cranky pants

246
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,166
after getting to spend the night
with Robin?

247
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,002
Shh! Jesus Christ.

248
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,337
Will you just give up
on your creepy dream already?

249
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,880
I heard you guys talking all night.

250
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,049
We were trying to figure out a way
to open up the door

251
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,759
while you children were sleeping.

252
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,177
After eight hours,

253
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,555
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,

254
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,474
you know, probably just a little bit
of the reason why I'm feeling just...

255
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,393
- a tad cranky.

256
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,436
What are you doing?

257
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,565
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm taking a leak. Look away.

258
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,649
Look away!

259
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,160
Can you redirect your stream, please?

260
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,664
Ugh.

261
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful!

262
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,754
We don't even know what that is.

263
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,380
Exactly. It could be useful.

264
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,840
Useful how?

265
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,176
We can survive down here a long time
without food,

266
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,387
but if the human body doesn't get water,
it will die.

267
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,764
I hate to break it to you,

268
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,600
but this is not water.

269
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,101
No, but it's a liquid,

270
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,978
and if it comes down to me
drinking that shit

271
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,396
or dying of thirst,

272
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,522
I drink.

273
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,491
We've got company.

274
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,267
You smell that?

275
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,811
What?

276
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,063
Piss.

277
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,390
Let's go.

278
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,269
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
I'm going!

279
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,105
- Henderson. Go, go.

280
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,318
Come on, Steve, let's go!

281
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,993
- Jesus Christ.
Ooh!

282
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,539
You still wanna drink that?

283
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,751
Holy mother of God.

284
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,338
Well...

285
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,465
hope you guys are in good shape.

286
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,385
Looking at you, roast beef.

287
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,347
Let's go, come on.

288
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,725
Why me?

289
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,190
It was the same thing,

290
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,233
the exact same thing
that happened to Will last year.

291
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,861
And look at this.
Look at the body temperatures.

292
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,822
He likes it cold.

293
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,825
Okay, so this crazy old woman
who was eating fertilizer—

294
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,702
- Mrs. Driscoll.
- Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.

295
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,412
- What time was this attack?
- Last night.

296
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,872
Right, but what time last night?

297
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,957
- Around 9:00.
- You waited all night to call?

298
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,084
I was waiting for the doctors
to run some tests.

299
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,252
You weren't there?

300
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,629
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

301
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,588
Hallelujah!

302
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,505
Ooh.

303
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,926
Um, so, wha— what time was your...
sauna test?

304
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,052
Around 9:00.

305
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,222
Well, that proves it.
That proves my theory.

306
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,681
She's flayed, just like Billy.

307
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,100
- Flayed?
- The Mind Flayer. He flays people.

308
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,185
Takes over their mind.

309
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,479
Once they do that,
they basically become him.

310
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,148
- If there are two flayed—
- We have to assume there are more.

311
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,316
Heather.

312
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,694
Billy was doing something to her.

313
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,822
She was scared.

314
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,783
She was screaming.

315
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,452
- Bad screams.

316
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,954
- What's a good scream?
- Max said—

317
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,957
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?

318
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,542
- She's a lifeguard at the pool.
- Heather Holloway?

319
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,670
Tom.

320
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,054
Seriously?

321
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,722
Welcome to my world.

322
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,518
Seat belts.

323
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,033
- Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close?
- What?

324
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,452
Can you not walk so close to me?
You stink.

325
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,122
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?

326
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,915
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?

327
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,250
Yeah, with me in it.

328
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,711
Well, I just want to remind you
of something, Joyce.

329
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,130
- I am not a mechanic.
- Yeah, clearly.

330
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,882
That's why you should've listened
to Alexei.

331
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,343
Oh, right, yeah.
Your new boyfriend, right?

332
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,763
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on
has to be my boyfriend.

333
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,057
Yeah, he reminds me a bit
of a Russian Scott Clarke.

334
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,183
Oh, here we go.

335
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,478
Maybe you should go on a date.
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?

336
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,271
- Whoa.
- What?

337
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,314
He's running.

338
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,777
You son of a bitch!

339
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,781
Hey! Smirnoff!

340
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,199
Get back here!

341
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,576
- Hey! C'mere!

342
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,954
Hey, c'mere!

343
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,397
You all gonna pay for those?

344
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,039
So, what are you,
some kinda bounty hunter?

345
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,207
I'm a cop.

346
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,793
I'm undercover.

347
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,971
Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.

348
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,889
Yeah, I— I'm just checking on Will.

349
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,350
At the movies?

350
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,020
Just keep your mouth shut, all right?

351
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,777
All right, all right, hop in.
Come on, get in.

352
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,028
- Hey!
- Hey!

353
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,822
You "hey!" You "hey!"

354
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,199
This is a police emergency, all right?

355
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,369
I need to commandeer your vehicle.

356
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,829
What?

357
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,123
As long as there's a... a...

358
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,458
What is your name, sir?

359
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,001
- Todd.
- Todd?

360
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,252
- Yeah.
- Todd.

361
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,920
- Todd.
- Todd...

362
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,797
listen to me.

363
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,507
That man in there,

364
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,134
I know he doesn't look it,

365
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:33,096
but he is one of the most dangerous men
in the world.

366
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,807
He's, uh...

367
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,311
- murdered many children.
- What?

368
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,063
Yeah, he's a true psychopath.
I tracked him over two state lines.

369
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,273
Hey, what's going on?

370
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,900
Ah, Detective Byers.

371
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,859
Uh...

372
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
this is Todd.

373
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:52,157
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle
to transport our dangerous criminal.

374
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,826
Oh, yes, he— very dangerous, uh,

375
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,785
forger... er.

376
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,704
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.

377
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,706
- Child murderer?
- We should really get going.

378
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,957
Hey, how do I get my car back?

379
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,792
- You just call the station.
- What station?

380
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,420
- Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!

381
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,505
Hey, what station?

382
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,256
You're doing the right thing!

383
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,302
Hey, what the... Hey!

384
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,138
Dude!

385
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,937
I mean, you have to admit,
as a feat of engineering alone,

386
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,355
this is impressive.

387
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,482
What are you talking about?
It's a total fire hazard.

388
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,025
There's no stairs, there's no exit,

389
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,236
there's just an elevator
that drops you halfway to hell.

390
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,153
They're Commies.

391
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,614
You don't pay people, they cut corners.

392
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,990
To be fair to our Russian comrades,

393
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,409
I don't think this tunnel was designed
for walking.

394
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,495
Think about it,
they developed the perfect system

395
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,663
for transporting that cargo.

396
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,748
It all comes into the mall
like any old delivery.

397
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,376
And then they load it up onto those trucks
and nobody's the wiser.

398
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,877
You think
they built this whole mall

399
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,171
so they could transport
that green poison?

400
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,715
I very seriously doubt
it's something as boring as poison.

401
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,968
It's gotta be much more valuable,
like promethium or something.

402
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,344
What the hell is promethium?

403
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,889
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make
Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.

404
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,850
You're all so nerdy,
it makes me physically ill.

405
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,561
No, no, no.
No, don't lump me in with them.

406
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,687
I'm not a nerd, all right?

407
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,438
Why so sensitive, Harrington?

408
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,524
Afraid of losing cool points
to a ten-year-old child?

409
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,235
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit
about Prometheus.

410
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,152
Promethium.

411
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,739
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure,
but whatever. All I'm saying is,

412
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,825
it's probably being used
to make something.

413
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,159
Or power something.

414
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,120
- Like a nuclear weapon?
- Totally.

415
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,289
Walking towards a nuclear weapon.
That's great.

416
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,708
- That'd be great.
- But if they're building something,

417
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,834
why here?

418
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,296
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places.

419
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,632
At the very best, we're a toilet stop
on your way to Disneyland,

420
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,926
but maybe that's it.
Maybe it's our very...

421
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,469
- You think the Russians know?
- About—

422
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,847
- They could.
- So it's connected?

423
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,056
- Maybe.
- How?

424
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,558
I don't know, but it's...

425
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,018
Possible.

426
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,895
I'm sorry, is there something you'd
like to share with the class?

427
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,484
Walkie.

428
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,537
"A trip to China sounds nice.

429
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,748
If you tread lightly."

430
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,207
It's the code.

431
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,710
- Wherever that broadcast is coming from—
- It's close.

432
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,629
And if there's one thing we know
about that signal...

433
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,297
It can reach the surface.

434
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,674
Let's go.

435
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,000
Tom?

436
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,003
Heather?

437
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,590
Jesus, it's freezing.

438
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,640
Do you guys smell that?

439
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,602
Oh.

440
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,354
Oh, God.

441
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,439
More chemicals.

442
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,071
You think they're guzzling this shit?

443
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,657
Yeah, either that or they just went on
a hell of a cleaning spree.

444
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,827
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.

445
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,161
- Did you?
- No.

446
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,913
This is something new.

447
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,165
Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit.

448
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,042
What happens
when you mix chemicals together?

449
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,794
You create a new substance.

450
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,130
- What if they're making something?
In themselves?

451
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,340
I mean, come on,
if you drink this crap, it'll kill you.

452
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,842
Yeah, if you're human.

453
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,112
Blood.

454
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,118
Yesterday,

455
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,746
Tom had a bandage on his forehead.

456
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,796
He was attacked.

457
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,964
Call 91—

458
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,749
They must have tied them.

459
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,338
They must have taken them somewhere.

460
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,759
Mrs. Driscoll.

461
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,011
She kept saying...

462
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,971
"I have to go back."

463
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,391
What if the flaying,

464
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,435
it's taking place somewhere else?

465
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,687
There must be a place
where all this started, right?

466
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,647
A source.

467
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,607
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.

468
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,237
If we can find the source,
then maybe we can stop him.

469
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,239
Or at least stop it from spreading

470
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,032
or doing whatever the hell he's doing
with those chemicals.

471
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,450
How do we find it?

472
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,035
Mrs. Driscoll.

473
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,039
If she wants to go back so badly,
why don't we let her?

474
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,966
this guy comes up to me,

475
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,801
I'm just pumping gas over here,

476
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,052
and he— Hey, whoa!

477
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,637
Don't cross me right now!

478
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,104
Busy day?

479
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,355
You could say that.

480
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,440
Some psycho stole that dude's car.

481
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,733
What else?

482
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,278
- What?
- What else did he say?

483
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,237
This psycho?

484
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,322
No offense, but I already
went over all this with the cops.

485
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,657
I'm not a cop.

486
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,950
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev.

487
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,786
Oh, shit!

488
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,497
Don't look at them.

489
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,915
At me.

490
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,084
Tell me

491
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,586
about this psycho.

492
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,138
Come on, let's go.

493
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,306
Move it.

494
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,767
I thought you said this guy
was a journalist.

495
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,728
Yeah, he, uh... he was.

496
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,396
Was?

497
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,525
Look at the camera.

498
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,113
The camera, above you to the right.

499
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,951
Identify yourselves.

500
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,579
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers,

501
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,663
Smirnoff.

502
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,373
- Alexei.
- Alexei.

503
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,625
Surname.

504
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,335
I don't know.

505
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,711
Family name!

506
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,796
Yeah, I know. I told— I don't know, okay?

507
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,299
Open the damn door!

508
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,009
Hopper.

509
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,261
It's all right. Don't worry.

510
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,597
He's a little bit eccentric, but...

511
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,390
he's completely harmless.

512
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,728
Name.

513
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,105
Get that out of my face,

514
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,358
you bald American pig.

515
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,444
I may be bald,

516
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,113
but you're the one in handcuffs,

517
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,531
Soviet scum.

518
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,244
Hi, Jim.

519
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,334
Wait.

520
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,063
Watch it.

521
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,523
Silence, scum.

522
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,608
- How long is this gonna take, because I—
- No.

523
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,776
- No.
- No.

524
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,988
- No, you do not get to question me.

525
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,824
You have dragged an enemy of the state
into my home

526
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,995
as carelessly as a child drags in shit
on his shoe.

527
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,123
I will search him until I am satisfied.

528
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,834
Jim. C'mere.

529
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,128
Just c'mere.
I need to talk to you.

530
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,045
Yeah, what?

531
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,840
- What?
- This is not gonna work.

532
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,135
- What do you mean?
- He's not eccentric, he's certifiable.

533
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,764
- Glass houses, Joyce.
- What?

534
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,684
- You know, pot calling the kettle black.
- Oh, come on.

535
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,477
- Excuse me!
- What?

536
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,063
Do me a favor
and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.

537
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,898
- Oh, oh, this?
- No, no, no.

538
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,275
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.

539
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,484
Spare me!

540
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,987
What is your problem?

541
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,780
Please, stop talking!

542
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,533
No! We have had a very long day.

543
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,660
We have been shot at,
nearly blown up,

544
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,705
walked God knows how many miles
in a hundred degree heat,

545
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,123
stole a car,

546
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,835
all while being chased
by this gigantic... psychopath,

547
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,379
all so we could bring him to you.

548
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,799
Because somehow, you're the closest person
who speaks Russian,

549
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,051
which I can't believe.

550
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,679
But that doesn't matter because,
unfortunately, we're here.

551
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,056
So, if you don't mind,

552
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,307
put that thing away,

553
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,977
stop behaving like a jackass,
and ask him what he's doing

554
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,022
that's making my magnets fall off
my damn fridge!

555
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,942
Please.

556
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,375
Okay, clear.

557
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,710
Clear, come on, let's go.

558
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,128
Okay, that was close.

559
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,838
Too close.
- Relax.

560
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,841
All right? Relax. Nobody saw...

561
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,021
Shit.

562
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,439
Jesus!

563
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,525
- Red Dawn.
- I saw it.

564
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,777
- First floor, northwest.
- Saw what?

565
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,861
The comms room.

566
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,238
You saw the comms room?

567
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,155
Correct.

568
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,450
- Are you sure?
- Positive. The door was open for a second,

569
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,537
and I saw a bunch of lights
and machines and shit in there.

570
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,330
That could be a hundred different things.

571
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,415
I'll take those odds.

572
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,137
All right.

573
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,264
We're gonna move fast,
we're gonna stay low.

574
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,181
- Okay?
- Okay.

575
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,234
Shh!

576
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,277
Move it.

577
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,867
Let's go.

578
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,497
Sh, sh. Come on.

579
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,136
Tread lightly!

580
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,346
Tread lightly!

581
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,764
Who are you?

582
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,684
Silver cat... Silver cat.

583
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,311
I don't understand.

584
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,023
- China?

585
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,417
Dude!

586
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,336
You did it!

587
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,254
You won a fight!

588
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,381
Jeez...

589
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,388
- What are you doing?
- Getting us our ticket out of here.

590
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,182
You want to walk all the way back?

591
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,809
Well, we can hang out for a little bit,
relax, have a picnic maybe.

592
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,312
Have a picnic?
We came here for the radio.

593
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,940
This plan is way better.
If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian,

594
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,608
that would've been our plan
in the first place.

595
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,864
- ... but I guess you're—
- Guys.

596
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,450
There's something up there.

597
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,121
Let's go.

598
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,590
Holy shit.

599
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,639
No, that is not mean.

600
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,266
That is honest.

601
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,809
She won't find out.

602
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,771
See, you're the only one who gon' tell—
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me!

603
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,273
Where do you think you're going?

604
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,941
Oh, um...

605
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,028
I was just going to visit
my grandma again.

606
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,321
And— And this...

607
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,448
this is my family.

608
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,367
- Extended.
- I don't care who they are.

609
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,162
You know the rules.
Two visitors at a time.

610
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,538
- Yeah, but—
- Two!

611
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,333
Girl, this child has lost her mind.

612
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,792
She brought a whole zoo in here.

613
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,387
You know,

614
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,223
those things that I said yesterday, I...

615
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,018
I didn't mean them.

616
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,855
- I know.
- I don't think you're like those assholes.

617
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,607
At all.

618
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,734
I never have. I...

619
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,278
- I was just—
- Angry?

620
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,697
Which I still don't get.

621
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,493
I mean, I was just completely, utterly,

622
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,745
mortifyingly...

623
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,039
wrong.

624
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,834
Don't let that go to your head.

625
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,002
I won't.

626
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,590
I just look forward to you
never doubting me again.

627
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,398
Oh, come on, you piece of shit!

628
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,495
Thanks.

629
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,129
Dude, I think that was it.

630
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,005
That was what?

631
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,591
The olive branch.

632
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,010
The what?

633
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,972
Oh, my God.

634
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,723
You're hopeless.

635
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,017
Okay,

636
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,978
I'll distract Max,

637
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,438
get you an opening.

638
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,524
And then talk to her. All right?

639
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,809
Where is she?

640
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,395
I don't know.

641
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,607
- Are you sure this is the right room?
- Yeah.

642
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,276
She's gone home.

643
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,992
We were hoping you might come back.

644
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,288
Whose blood is that?

645
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,833
Tom, whatever you've done, it's not you.

646
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,752
He's making you do this.

647
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:47,755
Go!

648
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,051
Owie.

649
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,596
Go, go, go!

650
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,976
- Run!

651
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,647
Yeah!

652
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,191
Got it, two in a row.
That was good, that was good.

653
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,448
Best three in a row now.
- Hey.

654
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:18,994
Hi.

655
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,290
Does your species like M&M's?

656
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,637
I like the new look, by the way.
It's cool.

657
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,681
Thanks.

658
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,775
Run!

659
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,445
This way, this way!

660
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,832
Nancy!

661
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,418
- Hello? Hello?

662
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,377
Here.

663
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,427
It's ringing.

664
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,887
I don't care how good her pie is.

665
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,223
No, I don't want her in my damn house.

666
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,600
Come on, pick up!

667
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,102
Nancy?

668
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,732
- Hi there.

669
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,698
I'm here for you, Nancy Drew.

670
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,873
- No!

671
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:56,925
Jonathan!

672
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,406
- You bitch.
Nancy!

673
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,624
Help! Help!

674
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,794
Help!

675
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,087
Is anyone here?

676
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,297
Nancy.

677
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,758
Nancy!

678
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,564
Where are you going?

679
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,509
Yoo-hoo.

680
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,430
Nancy Drew, where are you?

681
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,157
Nancy.

682
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,005
Marco...

683
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,551
Marco...

684
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,552
Polo!

685
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,511
Huh?

686
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,118
Go... to... hell!
