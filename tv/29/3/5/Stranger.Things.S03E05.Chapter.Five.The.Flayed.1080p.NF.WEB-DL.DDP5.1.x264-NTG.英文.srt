18
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,400
Shit! Shit!

19
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going down! We're going down!

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,980
Yeah, no shit, Harrington!

21
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,280
Why don't these buttons work?!

22
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,050
Press the button!

23
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,110
What do you think I'm doing?!

24
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,500
Come on, press something! Just press the button!

25
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,800
Push it!

26
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,160
My groin.

27
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,580
It fell on my groin.

28
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,530
Dustin!

29
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,460
Get this off of me!

30
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,480
I can't move.

31
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,240
Is everyone okay?

32
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,220
Yeah, I'm great, now that

33
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,560
I know that Russians can't design elevators!

34
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,010
I think we've clearly established that those buttons don't work.

35
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,610
They're buttons. They have to do something.

36
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,220
Yeah, if we had a keycard.

37
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,420
- A what? - It's an electronic lock.

38
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,180
Same as the loading dock door. If we don't have a keycard,

39
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,770
- it won't operate, meaning-- - We're stuck in here.

40
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,580
Yeah.

41
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,960
Just so you nerds are aware,

42
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,210
I'm supposed to be spending the night at Tina's,

43
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,240
and Tina always covers for me.

44
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,470
But if I'm not home for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow

45
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,600
and my mom finds out you three are responsible,

46
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,430
she's gonna hunt you down, one by one, and slit your throat.

47
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,400
I don't care about Tina!

48
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,670
Or Uncle Jack's party!

49
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,430
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us

50
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,410
if we're dead in a Russian elevator!

51
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,220
What if we climbed out?

52
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,810
What were you saying about climbing?

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,660
Looks like somebody's home.

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,510
Did you hear that?

55
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,730
Where's that coming from?

56
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,410
It's below us.

58
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,510
Hey, dipshits!

59
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,250
Hawkins PD. Hands in the air.

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,400
Don't make me say it again!

61
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,350
English.

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,900
You speak English?

63
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,400
I can't understand you!

64
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,190
I can't understand you.

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,810
No understand!

66
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,840
Hopper!

67
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,020
Don't move!

68
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,230
Drop the gun.

69
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,290
Drop it!

70
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,890
You understand what I'm saying, big guy?

71
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,910
Drop the weapon.

72
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,850
Or what?

73
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
You going to shoot?

74
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,960
Good.

75
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,700
So you do understand what I'm saying, huh?

76
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,930
And, yeah,

77
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,110
you don't put that thing away, I'm gonna blow some daylight

78
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,070
into that thick skull of yours.

79
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,970
No.

80
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,270
You won't do that.

81
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,830
Why's that?

82
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,840
Because you are policeman.

83
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,000
Policemen have rules.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
Oh, yeah?

85
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,400
Wanna test that theory?

86
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,750
I'm gonna count to three.

87
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,220
One,

88
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,750
two,

89
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,330
three!

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,950
Hopper!

91
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,890
Oh, shit.

92
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,680
Go!

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,290
Move, Joyce!

94
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,950
- Oh, God. - Come on, Smirnoff.

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,450
You're coming with us!

96
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,690
Go, go, go!

97
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,140
Let's go! Let's go!

98
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,430
Move it, Smirnoff! Move it!

99
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,630
Run!

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,420
Joyce! Drive!

101
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,990
- Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around! - Are you kidding me?

102
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,970
- Shit! - Go!

103
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,190
Joyce, drive.

104
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,590
- I'm trying! - Joyce, please, drive!

105
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,980
Drive!

106
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,240
Get us outta here!

107
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,090
Oh, God!

108
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,160
Hang on!

109
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,770
Still think it was our government?

112
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,890
God, shut up!

113
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,360
- Hello? - Jonathan.

114
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,260
Do you realize what time it is?

115
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,580
Listen to me, okay?

116
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,130
It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh,

117
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,080
I had a late night with Fagin and the gang, so--

118
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,570
- I'm at the hospital with Driscoll. - What?

120
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,800
She's been sedated for a few hours

121
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,010
and the doctors are still running tests.

122
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,780
Nancy, please tell me you're joking.

123
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,540
It's not a joke. And, yes, I know I'm insane

124
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,940
and irrational and out of touch, but can you save your lecture,

125
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,130
because I really don't give a shit right now. I just...

126
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,540
I need you to put me on the phone

127
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,730
with your brother.

128
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,500
- What? - Jonathan...

129
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,710
Please.

130
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,260
He's not even here.

131
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,720
Where is he?

132
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,540
Is he safe?

133
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,030
Why wouldn't he be safe?

134
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,680
Nancy?

135
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,180
Why wouldn't he be safe?

136
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,610
Son of a bitch.

137
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,660
Son of a bitch!

138
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,530
Okay, a magnet? Magnets?

139
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,430
- Do you know "Magnet"? Magnet? - Magnit.

140
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,630
Yes, magnit.

141
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,700
Okay, so, uh, magnit...

142
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,060
on my-- my fridge,

143
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,000
my icebox, and then they...

144
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,120
they fell.

145
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,620
They demagnetized, stopped working. Uh, do you understand?

146
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,170
Da.

147
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,190
Okay, so is that because of the machines that you're working on?

148
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,940
- Machina. - Machina, machina, yes.

149
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,420
Da, da, machina.

150
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,380
- Machina, machina! - Yes, machina--

151
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,380
Vroom, vroom.

152
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,440
Oh, not-- not the car.

153
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,740
The machines at Hess Farm where--

154
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,050
- where we kidnapped you-- - Joyce, please!

155
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,070
You're givin' me a headache, both of you!

156
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,530
Hold on, please. One minute.

157
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,120
I am making progress.

158
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,190
- Progress. - Yeah.

159
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,220
What have you learned, huh?

160
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,730
You learned that Smirnoff over there--

161
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,610
- Alexei. - Smirnoff is Russian

162
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,040
and works for Starcourt,

163
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,390
two things we already knew.

164
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,140
Thought we knew.

165
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,200
But now we know-know, because I've confirmed them.

166
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,120
You're welcome.

167
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,070
Yeah? Why don't you confirm whether this baby'll start, huh?

168
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,270
- Keep it in park, please. - Yeah, duh!

169
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,360
You do-- do something useful.

170
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,440
You do something useful.

171
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,090
It's not working.

172
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,860
Try it again.

173
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,340
Shit.

174
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,120
Stop, stop!

175
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,960
Shut up, Smirnoff!

176
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,910
Aw, come on! D'you hear me?

177
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,400
I said shut your damn--

178
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,370
Shit!

179
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,760
Oh, Jesus.

180
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,180
Stop.

181
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,930
I thought this friend of yours lived in Illinois.

182
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,400
He's not really a friend. He's more like an acquaintance.

183
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,950
Okay, well--

184
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,390
Keep up, keep up, keep up.

185
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,730
Easy.

186
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,510
Okay, so this acquaintance...

187
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,870
- lives in Illinois? Correct? - Yeah, yeah.

188
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,800
So we're walking to Illinois?

189
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,670
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.

190
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,420
You know, I figure we'll get there by, like, Friday evening.

191
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,440
I hope that works for your schedule. Jesus Christ, Joyce.

192
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,860
We're not walking to Illinois, okay?

193
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,050
Well, then what are we doing?

194
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,920
I don't know, okay?

195
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,630
I will-- I will figure something out.

196
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,710
Isn't there someone in Indiana who speaks Russian that--

197
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,610
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.

198
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,510
I'm all ears.

199
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,610
I'm all ears!

200
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,030
I mean, fine.

201
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,350
Just saying.

202
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,350
Damn it.

203
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,270
I found him.

204
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,960
Where is he?

205
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,430
Woods.

206
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,060
Woods?

207
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,430
He's with... Will's mom.

208
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,960
My-- My mom?

209
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,550
What are they doing?

210
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,860
Ill... annoy.

211
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,810
They're going to Ill-annoy.

212
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,450
Mike! Breakfast!

213
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,120
Not now, Mom!

214
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,900
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?

215
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,240
The state of Illinois?

216
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,810
Ill-annoy.

217
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,050
Does it still hurt?

218
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,690
Only when I talk.

219
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,220
Well, it's a good thing you're not Mike, then.

220
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,470
And you'd be in constant pain.

221
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,140
Something's not right. I can't get Hopper off my back all summer,

222
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,990
now all of a sudden, he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?

223
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,540
And Dustin's MIA, too?

224
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,530
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.

225
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,730
What does it matter?

226
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,910
The bottom line is, they're not here.

227
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,770
- It's up to us. - Up to us to do what exactly?

228
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,500
Find Billy and stop him.

229
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay, yeah, that's a really nice sentiment,

230
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,550
but even if El could find him again,

231
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,710
and that's a pretty big if, then what?

232
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,180
We burn the shit out of him

233
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,480
and make sure he doesn't escape this time.

234
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,320
- Okay, then what? - Then we win.

235
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,190
No, see, that's the problem.

236
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,090
We don't. We don't win.

237
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,520
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before

238
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,870
and he just came right back.

239
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,000
We don't just have to stop Billy,

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,690
we have to stop the Mind Flayer.

241
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,670
- How in the hell do we do that? - I don't know.

242
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,830
Maybe El does.

243
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,400
What are they still doing in there?

244
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,040
I don't know.

245
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,730
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.

246
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,590
Why?

247
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,190
- I mean, I don't know. - They're conspiring against me.

248
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,780
That's what you're concerned about now?

249
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,090
It's not my main concern.

250
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,210
- It's just a sub-concern. - I thought it was already over.

251
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,440
It's not over, okay? We're just taking a break.

252
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,990
She said she dumped your ass.

253
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,560
- That doesn't sound like a break. - It wasn't!

254
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,870
You guys do realize we can

255
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,240
still hear everything you're saying, right?

256
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,060
Conspiring.

257
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,950
I told you, they're conspiring.

258
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,890
Not now, Mom!

259
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,760
Mike, open the door.

260
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,790
Code red, I repeat, code red.

261
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,070
Does anyone copy?

262
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,900
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.

263
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,510
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red. Does anyone copy?

264
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,260
We are innocent children and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.

265
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,360
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins, and if we are found,

266
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,530
they will torture and kill us.

267
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,490
Gotta take it easy on that thing. Gonna drain the battery.

268
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,070
- The mall just opened. - So?

269
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,560
So someone could be in range.

270
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,320
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop is gonna rappel down here

271
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,570
and save the day?

272
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,080
All right, why are you such a cranky pants

273
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,630
after getting to spend the night with Robin?

274
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,090
Jesus Christ.

275
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,290
Will you just give up on your creepy dream already?

276
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,720
I heard you guys talking all night.

277
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,010
Yeah. We were trying to figure out a way to open up the door

278
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,990
while you children were sleeping.

279
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,330
After eight hours,

280
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,660
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,

281
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,130
you know, probably just a little bit of the reason

282
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,630
why I'm feeling just...

283
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,160
a tad cranky.

284
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,940
What are you doing?

285
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,610
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm taking a leak. Look away.

286
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,800
Look away!

287
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,660
Can you redirect your stream, please?

288
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,440
Be careful, careful, careful!

289
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,530
We don't even know what that is.

290
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,430
Exactly. It could be useful.

291
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,010
Useful how?

292
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,390
We can survive down here a long time without food,

293
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,600
but if the human body doesn't get water, it will die.

294
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,780
I hate to break it to you,

295
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,450
but this is not water.

296
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,960
No, but it's a liquid,

297
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,080
and if it comes down to me drinking that shit

298
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,530
or dying of thirst,

299
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,810
I drink.

300
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,090
We've got company.

301
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,420
You smell that?

302
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,900
What?

303
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,410
Piss.

304
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,530
Let's go.

305
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,620
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go. - I'm going!

306
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,060
Henderson. Go, go.

307
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,550
Come on, Steve, let's go!

308
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,040
Jesus Christ.

309
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,700
You still wanna drink that?

310
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,150
Holy mother of God.

311
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,160
Well...

312
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,560
hope you guys are in good shape.

313
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,460
Looking at you, roast beef.

314
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,450
Let's go, come on.

315
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,830
Why me?

317
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,260
It was the same thing,

318
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,320
the exact same thing that happened to Will last year.

319
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,460
And look at this. Look at the body temperatures.

320
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,250
He likes it cold.

321
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,790
Okay, so this crazy old woman who was eating fertilizer--

322
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,750
- Mrs. Driscoll. - Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.

323
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,480
- What time was this attack? - Last night.

324
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,760
Right, but what time last night?

325
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,360
- Around 9:00. - You waited all night to call?

326
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,260
I was waiting for the doctors to run some tests.

327
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,420
You weren't there?

328
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,840
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

329
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,240
Hallelujah!

330
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,360
Um, so, wha-- what time was your... sauna test?

331
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
- Around 9:00. - Around 9:00.

332
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,250
Well, that proves it. That proves my theory.

333
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,810
She's flayed, just like Billy.

334
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,330
- Flayed? - The Mind Flayer. He flays people.

335
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,220
Takes over their mind.

336
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,580
Once they do that, they basically become him.

337
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,600
- If there are two flayed-- - We have to assume there are more.

338
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,600
Heather.

339
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,950
Billy was doing something to her.

340
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,150
She was scared.

341
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,090
She was screaming.

342
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,350
Bad screams.

343
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,060
- What's a good scream? - Max said--

344
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,090
- Doesn't matter. - I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?

345
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,940
- She's a lifeguard at the pool. - Heather Holloway?

346
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,990
Tom.

347
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,230
Seriously?

348
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,970
Welcome to my world.

349
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
Seat belts.

350
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,320
- Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close? - What?

351
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,960
Can you not walk so close to me? You stink.

352
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,190
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?

353
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,990
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?

354
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,570
Yeah, with me in it.

355
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,800
Well, I just want to remind you of something, Joyce.

356
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,410
- I am not a mechanic. - Yeah, clearly.

357
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,880
That's why you should've listened to Alexei.

358
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,490
Oh, right, yeah. Your new boyfriend, right?

359
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,840
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on has to be my boyfriend.

360
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,210
Yeah, he reminds me a bit of a Russian Scott Clarke.

361
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,310
Oh, here we go.

362
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,350
Maybe you should go on a date.

363
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,870
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?

364
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,390
What?

365
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,560
He's running.

366
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,430
You son of a bitch!

367
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,570
Smirnoff!

368
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,490
Get back here!

369
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,950
C'mere!

370
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,380
Hey, c'mere!

371
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,740
You all gonna pay for those?

372
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,400
So, what are you, some kinda bounty hunter?

373
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,540
I'm a cop.

374
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,850
I'm undercover.

375
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,990
Karen, it's Joyce.

376
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,110
Yeah, I-- I'm just checking on Will.

377
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,700
At the movies?

378
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,450
Just keep your mouth shut, all right?

379
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,140
All right, all right, hop in. Come on, get in.

380
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,970
You "Hey!" You "Hey!"

381
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,550
This is a police emergency, all right?

382
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,000
I need to commandeer your vehicle.

383
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,890
What?

384
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,200
As long as there's a... a...

385
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,680
What is your name, sir?

386
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,110
- Todd. - Todd?

387
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,380
- Yeah. - Todd.

388
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,150
- Todd. - Todd...

389
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,960
listen to me.

390
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,820
That man in there,

391
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,480
I know he doesn't look it,

392
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,880
but he is one of the most dangerous men in the world.

393
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,910
He's, uh...

394
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,380
- murdered many children. - What?

395
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,120
Yeah, he's a true psychopath. I tracked him over two state lines.

396
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,400
Hey, what's going on?

397
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,190
Ah, Detective Byers.

398
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,580
This is Todd.

399
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,340
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle

400
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,170
to transport our dangerous criminal.

401
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,990
Oh, yes, he-- very dangerous, uh,

402
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,950
forger... er.

403
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,760
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.

404
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,530
- Child murderer? - We should really get going.

405
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,010
Hey, how do I get my car back?

406
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,090
- You just call the station. - What station?

407
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,480
Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!

408
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,750
Hey, what station?

409
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,710
You're doing the right thing!

410
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,490
Hey, what the... Hey!

411
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,260
Dude!

412
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,910
I mean, you have to admit, as a feat of engineering alone,

413
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,540
this is impressive.

414
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,740
What are you talking about? It's a total fire hazard.

415
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,010
There's no stairs, there's no exit,

416
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,160
there's just an elevator that drops you halfway to hell.

417
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,260
They're Commies.

418
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,770
You don't pay people, they cut corners.

419
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,380
To be fair to our Russian comrades,

420
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,590
I don't think this tunnel was designed for walking.

421
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,600
I mean, think about it, they developed the perfect system

422
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,760
for transporting that cargo.

423
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,840
It all comes into the mall like any old delivery.

424
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,150
And then they load it up onto those trucks

425
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,540
and nobody's the wiser.

426
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,600
You think they built this whole mall

427
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,270
so they could transport that green poison?

428
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,690
I very seriously doubt it's something as boring as poison.

429
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,260
It's gotta be much more valuable, like promethium or something.

430
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,440
What the hell is promethium?

431
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,430
It's what Victor Stone's dad used

432
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,940
to make Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.

433
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,840
You're all so nerdy, it makes me physically ill.

434
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,470
No, no, no. No, don't lump me in with them.

435
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,830
I'm not a nerd, all right?

436
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,600
Why so sensitive, Harrington?

437
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,550
Afraid of losing cool points to a ten-year-old child?

438
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,420
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit about Prometheus.

439
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,230
Promethium.

440
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,050
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure,

441
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,840
but whatever. All I'm saying is,

442
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,990
it's probably being used to make something.

443
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,380
Or power something.

444
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,430
- Like a nuclear weapon? - Totally.

445
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,410
Walking towards a nuclear weapon. That's great.

446
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,900
- That'd be great. - But if they're building something,

447
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,940
why here?

448
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,380
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places.

449
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,750
At the very best, we're a toilet stop on your way to Disneyland,

450
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,240
but maybe that's it. Maybe it's our very...

451
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,680
- You think the Russians know? - About--

452
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,990
- They could. - So it's connected?

453
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,330
- Maybe. - How?

454
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,900
I don't know, but it's...

455
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,140
Possible.

456
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,270
I'm sorry, is there something you'd like to share with the class?

457
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,960
Walkie.

458
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,710
"A trip to China sounds nice.

459
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,110
If you tread lightly."

460
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,390
It's the code.

461
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,960
- Wherever that broadcast is coming from-- - It's close.

462
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,910
And if there's one thing we know about that signal...

463
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,570
It can reach the surface.

464
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,080
Let's go.

465
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,080
Tom?

466
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,020
Heather?

467
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,790
Jesus, it's freezing.

468
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,720
Do you guys smell that?

469
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,620
Oh, God.

470
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,860
More chemicals.

471
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,910
You think they're guzzling this shit?

472
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,620
Yeah, either that

473
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,860
or they just went on a hell of a cleaning spree.

474
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,880
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.

475
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,600
- Did you? - No.

476
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,130
This is something new.

477
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,400
Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit.

478
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,380
What happens when you mix chemicals together?

479
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,930
You create a new substance.

480
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,390
- What if they're making something? - In themselves?

481
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,380
I mean, come on, if you drink this crap, it'll kill you.

482
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,360
Yeah, if you're human.

483
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,200
Blood.

484
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,230
Yesterday,

485
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,880
Tom had a bandage on his forehead.

486
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,960
He was attacked.

487
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,240
Call 91--

488
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,020
They must have tied them.

489
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,650
They must have taken them somewhere.

490
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,980
Mrs. Driscoll.

491
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,140
She kept saying...

492
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,510
"I have to go back."

493
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,370
What if the flaying,

494
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,480
it's taking place somewhere else?

495
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,650
There must be a place where all this started, right?

496
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,080
A source.

497
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,090
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.

498
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,520
If we can find the source, then maybe we can stop him.

499
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,060
Or at least stop it from spreading

500
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,310
or doing whatever the hell he's doing with those chemicals.

501
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,640
How do we find it?

502
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,100
Mrs. Driscoll.

503
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,250
If she wants to go back so badly, why don't we let her?

504
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,380
...this guy comes up to me,

505
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,700
I'm just pumping gas over here,

506
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,240
and he-- Hey, whoa!

507
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,950
Don't cross me right now!

508
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,190
Busy day?

509
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,490
You could say that.

510
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,870
Some psycho stole that dude's car.

511
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,860
What else?

512
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,390
- What? - What else did he say?

513
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,260
This psycho?

514
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,640
No offense, but I already went over all this with the cops.

515
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,670
I'm not a cop.

516
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,490
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev.

517
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,260
Oh, shit!

518
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,860
Don't look at them.

519
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,030
At me.

520
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,060
Tell me

521
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,850
about this psycho.

522
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,470
Come on, let's go.

523
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,460
Move it.

524
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,110
I thought you said this guy was a journalist.

525
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,050
Yeah, he, uh... he was.

526
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,190
Was?

527
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,860
Look at the camera.

528
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,000
The camera, above you to the right.

529
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,240
Identify yourselves.

530
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,730
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers,

531
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,770
Smirnoff.

532
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,610
- Alexei. - Alexei.

533
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,740
Surname.

534
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,280
I don't know.

535
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,630
Family name!

536
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,940
Yeah, I know. I told-- I don't know, okay?

537
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,670
Open the damn door!

538
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,460
Hopper.

539
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,460
It's all right. Don't worry.

540
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,870
He's a little bit eccentric, but...

541
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,780
he's completely harmless.

542
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,870
Name.

543
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,580
Get that out of my face,

544
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,930
you bald American pig.

545
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,780
I may be bald,

546
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,170
but you're the one in handcuffs,

547
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,840
Soviet scum.

548
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,310
Hi, Jim.

549
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,230
Wait.

550
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,040
Watch it.

551
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,440
Silence, scum.

552
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,770
- How long is this gonna take, because I-- - No.

553
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,060
- No. - No.

554
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,260
No, you do not get to question me.

555
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,860
You have dragged an enemy of the state into my home

556
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,110
as carelessly as a child drags in shit on his shoe.

557
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,790
I will search him until I am satisfied.

558
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,540
Jim. C'mere.

559
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,460
Just c'mere. I need to talk to you.

560
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,550
Yeah, what?

561
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,070
- What? - This is not gonna work.

562
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,890
- What do you mean? - He's not eccentric, he's certifiable.

563
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,770
- Glass houses, Joyce. - What?

564
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,560
- You know, pot calling the kettle black. - Oh, come on.

565
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,630
- Excuse me! - What?

566
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,470
Do me a favor and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.

567
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,970
- Oh, oh, this? - No, no, no.

568
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,090
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.

569
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,760
Spare me!

570
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,180
What is your problem?

571
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,890
Please, stop talking!

572
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,560
No! We have had a very long day.

573
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,760
We have been shot at, nearly blown up,

574
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
walked God knows how many miles in a hundred degree heat,

575
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,190
stole a car,

576
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,850
all while being chased by this gigantic... psychopath,

577
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,330
all so we could bring him to you.

578
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,910
Because somehow, you're the closest person who speaks Russian,

579
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,950
which I can't believe.

580
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,700
But that doesn't matter because, unfortunately, we're here.

581
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,210
So, if you don't mind,

582
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,270
put that thing away,

583
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,030
stop behaving like a jackass, and ask him what he's doing

584
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,450
that's making my magnets fall off my damn fridge!

585
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,410
Please.

586
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,440
Okay, clear.

587
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,720
Clear, come on, let's go.

588
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,240
Okay, that was close.

589
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,210
- Too close. - Relax.

590
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,880
All right? Relax. Nobody saw...

591
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,870
Shit.

592
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,570
Jesus!

593
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,770
- Red Dawn. - I saw it.

594
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,840
- First floor, northwest. - Saw what?

595
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,930
The comms room.

596
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,350
You saw the comms room?

597
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,450
Correct.

598
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,880
- Are you sure? - Positive. The door was open for a second,

599
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,480
and I saw a bunch of lights and machines and shit in there.

600
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,060
That could be a hundred different things.

601
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,590
I'll take those odds.

602
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,110
All right.

603
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,370
We're gonna move fast, we're gonna stay low.

604
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,970
- Okay? - Okay.

605
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,370
Move it.

606
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,980
Let's go.

607
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,650
Come on.

608
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,580
Tread lightly!

609
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,710
Tread lightly!

610
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,900
Who are you?

611
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,200
Silver cat... Silver cat.

612
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,650
I don't understand.

613
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,610
China?

614
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,490
Dude!

615
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,500
You did it!

616
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,770
You won a fight!

617
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,440
Jeez...

618
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,380
- What are you doing? - Getting us our ticket out of here.

619
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,230
You want to walk all the way back?

620
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,520
Well, we can hang out for a little bit,

621
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,850
relax, have a picnic maybe.

622
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,240
Have a picnic? We came here for the radio.

623
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,500
This plan is way better.

624
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,890
If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian,

625
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,010
that would've been our plan in the first place.

626
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,120
- ...but I guess you're-- - Guys.

627
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,370
There's something up there.

628
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,320
Let's go.

629
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,820
Holy shit.

630
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,850
No, that is not mean.

631
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,520
That is honest.

632
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,180
She won't find out.

633
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,160
See, you're the only one

634
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,020
who gon' tell-- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me!

635
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,830
Where do you think you're going?

636
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,180
I was just going to visit my grandma again.

637
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,660
And-- And this...

638
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,690
this is my family.

639
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,640
- Extended. - I don't care who they are.

640
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,510
You know the rules. Two visitors at a time.

641
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,020
- Yeah, but-- - Two!

642
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,560
Girl, this child has lost her mind.

643
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,210
She brought a whole zoo in here.

644
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,520
You know,

645
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,340
those things that I said yesterday, I...

646
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,400
I didn't mean them.

647
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,210
- I know. - I don't think you're like those assholes.

648
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,610
At all.

649
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,800
I never have. I...

650
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,320
- I was just-- - Angry?

651
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,970
Which I still don't get.

652
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,900
I mean, I was just completely, utterly,

653
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,630
mortifyingly...

654
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,250
wrong.

655
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,790
Don't let that go to your head.

656
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,160
I won't.

657
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,110
I just look forward to you never doubting me again.

658
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,940
Oh, come on, you piece of shit!

659
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,070
Thanks.

660
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,450
Dude, I think that was it.

661
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,030
That was what?

662
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,930
The olive branch.

663
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,040
The what?

664
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,130
Oh, my God.

665
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,070
You're hopeless.

666
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,290
Okay,

667
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,190
I'll distract Max,

668
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,580
get you an opening.

669
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,220
And then talk to her. All right?

670
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,750
Where is she?

671
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,320
I don't know.

672
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,140
- Are you sure this is the right room? - Yeah.

673
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,780
She's gone home.

674
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,350
We were hoping you might come back.

675
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,270
Whose blood is that?

676
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,160
Tom, whatever you've done, it's not you.

677
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,360
He's making you do this.

678
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,930
Go!

679
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,470
Owie.

680
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,770
Go, go, go!

681
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,060
Run!

682
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,530
Yeah!

683
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,720
- Got it, two in a row. - That was good, that was good.

684
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,410
Best three in a row now.

685
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,530
Does your species like M&M's?

686
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,980
I like the new look, by the way. It's cool.

687
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,740
Thanks.

688
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,250
Run!

689
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,520
This way, this way!

690
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,810
Nancy!

691
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,610
Hello? Hello?!

692
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:08,430
Here.

693
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,520
It's ringing.

694
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,020
I don't care how good her pie is.

695
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,260
No, I don't want her in my damn house.

696
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,630
Come on, pick up!

697
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,700
Nancy?

698
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,650
Hi there.

699
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,300
I'm here for you, Nancy Drew.

700
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,710
No!

701
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,590
Jonathan!

702
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,430
- You bitch. - Nancy!

703
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,200
Run!

704
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,950
Help! Help!

705
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,010
Help!

706
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,640
Is anyone here?!

707
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,390
Nancy.

708
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,090
Nancy!

709
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,110
Where are you going?

710
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,760
Nancy Drew, where are you?

711
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,340
Nancy.

712
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,320
Marco...

713
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,560
Marco...

714
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,630
Polo!

715
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,160
Go... to... hell!
