1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,018
Shit! Shit!

2
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,225
We're going down! We're going down!

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,900
Yeah, no shit, Harrington!

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,229
Why don't these buttons work?!

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,032
Press the button!

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,648
What do you think I'm doing?!

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,025
Come on, press something!
Just press the button!

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,492
Push it!

9
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,947
Oh!

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,034
My groin.

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,406
It fell on my groin.

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,584
Dustin!

13
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,212
Get this off of me!

14
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,207
I can't move.

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,252
Is everyone okay?

16
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,085
Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that
Russians can't design elevators!

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,973
I think we've clearly established
that those buttons don't work.

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,611
They're buttons.
They have to do something.

19
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,095
Yeah, if we had a keycard.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,009
- A what?
- It's an electronic lock.

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,325
Same as the loading dock door.
If we don't have a keycard,

22
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,429
- it won't operate, meaning...
- We're stuck in here.

23
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,477
Yeah.

24
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,904
Just so you nerds are aware,

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,980
I'm supposed to be spending the night
at Tina's,

26
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,107
and Tina always covers for me.

27
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,284
But if I'm not home
for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow

28
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,283
and my mom finds out
you three are responsible,

29
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:19,246
she's gonna hunt you down, one by one,
and slit your throat.

30
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,289
I don't care about Tina!

31
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,462
Or Uncle Jack's party!

32
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:28,001
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us
if we're dead in a Russian elevator!

33
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,214
Hey.

34
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,882
What if we climbed out?

35
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,864
What were you saying about climbing?

36
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,853
Looks like somebody's home.

37
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,288
Did you hear that?

38
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,372
Where's that coming from?

39
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,133
It's below us.

40
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,879
Hey, dipshits!

41
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,850
Hawkins PD. Hands in the air.

42
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,850
Don't make me say it again!

43
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,232
English.

44
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,776
You speak English?

45
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,855
I can't understand you!

46
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,366
I can't understand you.

47
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,370
No understand!

48
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,042
Hopper!

49
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,001
Don't move!

50
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,172
Drop the gun.

51
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,798
Drop it!

52
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,684
You understand what I'm saying, big guy?

53
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,681
Drop the weapon.

54
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,883
Or what?

55
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,810
You going to shoot?

56
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,851
Good.

57
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,613
So you do understand
what I'm saying, huh?

58
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,808
And, yeah,

59
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,108
you don't put that thing away,
I'm gonna blow some daylight

60
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,863
into that thick skull of yours.

61
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,944
No.

62
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,778
You won't do that.

63
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,570
Why's that?

64
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,491
Because you are policeman.

65
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,583
Policemen have rules.

66
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,662
Oh, yeah?

67
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,211
Wanna test that theory?

68
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,246
I'm gonna count to three.

69
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,961
One,

70
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,797
two,

71
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,263
three!

72
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,916
Hopper!

73
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,455
Oh, shit.

74
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,547
Go!

75
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,257
Move, Joyce!

76
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,600
- Oh, God.
- Come on, Smirnoff.

77
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,386
You're coming with us!

78
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,442
Go, go, go!

79
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,157
Let's go! Let's go!

80
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,159
Move it, Smirnoff! Move it!

81
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,324
Run!

82
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,660
Joyce! Drive!

83
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,458
- Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around!
- Are you kidding me?

84
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,804
- Shit!
- Go!

85
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,881
Joyce, drive.

86
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,255
- I'm trying!
- Joyce, please, drive!

87
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,176
Drive!

88
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,806
Get us outta here!

89
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,332
Oh, God!

90
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,827
Hang on!

91
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,342
Still think it was our government?

92
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,517
God, shut up!

93
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,275
- Hello?
- Jonathan.

94
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,155
Do you realize what time it is?

95
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,452
Listen to me, okay?

96
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:24,035
It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh, I had a late night
with Fagin and the gang, so...

97
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,383
- I'm at the hospital with Driscoll.
- What?

98
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,979
She's been sedated for a few hours
and the doctors are still running tests.

99
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,463
Nancy, please tell me you're joking.

100
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,256
It's not a joke.
And, yes, I know I'm insane

101
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,819
and irrational and out of touch,
but can you save your lecture,

102
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,003
because I really don't give a shit
right now. I just...

103
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,427
I need you to put me on the phone

104
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,345
with your brother.

105
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,055
- What?
- Jonathan...

106
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,602
Please.

107
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,145
Uh...

108
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,362
He's not even here.

109
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Where is he?

110
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,150
Is he safe?

111
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,821
Why wouldn't he be safe?

112
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,570
Nancy?

113
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,872
Why wouldn't he be safe?

114
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,084
Son of a bitch.

115
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,285
Son of a bitch!

116
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,248
Okay, a magnet? Magnets?

117
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,377
- Do you know "magnet"? Magnet?
- Magnit.

118
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,625
Yes, magnit.

119
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,426
Okay, so, uh, magnit...

120
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,048
on my... my fridge,

121
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,546
my icebox, and then they...

122
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,352
they fell.

123
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,311
They demagnetized, stopped working.
Uh, do you understand?

124
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,233
Da.

125
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,110
Okay, so is that because of the machines
that you're working on?

126
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,189
- Machina.
- Machina, machina, yes.

127
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,359
Da, da, machina.

128
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,323
- Machina, machina!
- Yes, machina...

129
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,324
Vroom, vroom.

130
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,155
Oh, not... not the car.

131
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,580
The machines at Hess Farm where...

132
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,039
- where we kidnapped you...
- Joyce, please!

133
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
You're givin' me a headache, both of you!

134
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,923
Hold on, please. One minute.

135
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,998
Hey.

136
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,753
I am making progress.

137
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,205
- Progress.
- Yeah.

138
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,898
What have you learned, huh?
You learned that Smirnoff over there...

139
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,302
- Alexei.
- Smirnoff is Russian

140
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,933
and works for Starcourt,

141
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,219
two things we already knew.

142
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,142
Thought we knew.

143
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,100
But now we know-know,
because I've confirmed them.

144
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,181
You're welcome.

145
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,766
Yeah? Why don't you confirm
whether this baby'll start, huh?

146
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,813
- Keep it in park, please.
- Yeah, duh!

147
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,016
You do... do something useful.

148
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,028
You do something useful.

149
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,541
It's not working.

150
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,408
Try it again.

151
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,205
Shit.

152
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,961
Hey. Hey.

153
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,047
Stop, stop!

154
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,222
Shut up, Smirnoff!

155
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,756
Aw, come on! D'you hear me?

156
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,255
I said shut your damn...

157
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,056
Shit!

158
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,269
Oh, Jesus.

159
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,726
Whoa!

160
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,066
Stop.

161
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,861
I thought this friend of yours
lived in Illinois.

162
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,277
He's not really a friend.
He's more like an acquaintance.

163
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,576
Oh? Okay, well...

164
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,369
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep up, keep up, keep up.

165
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,754
Easy.

166
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,040
Okay, so this acquaintance...

167
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,791
- lives in Illinois? Correct?
- Yeah, yeah.

168
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,747
So we're walking to Illinois?

169
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,757
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.

170
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,193
You know, I figure we'll get there
by, like, Friday evening.

171
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,445
I hope that works for your schedule.
Jesus Christ, Joyce.

172
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,114
- We're not walking to Illinois, okay?
- Well, then what are we doing?

173
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,138
I don't know, okay?

174
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,351
I will... I will figure something out.

175
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,483
Isn't there someone in Indiana
who speaks Russian that...

176
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,561
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.

177
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,477
I'm all ears.

178
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,564
I'm all ears!

179
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,529
I mean, fine.

180
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,109
Just saying.

181
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,204
Gah!

182
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,529
Ugh!

183
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,573
Gah!

184
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,124
Damn it.

185
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,997
I found him.

186
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,004
Where is he?

187
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,472
Woods.

188
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,930
Woods?

189
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,009
He's with... Will's mom.

190
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,675
My... My mom?

191
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,519
What are they doing?

192
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,388
Ill... annoy.

193
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,563
They're going to Ill-annoy.

194
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,414
Mike! Breakfast!

195
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,728
Not now, Mom!

196
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,435
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?

197
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,153
The state of Illinois?

198
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,492
Ill-annoy.

199
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,753
Does it still hurt?

200
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,207
Only when I talk.

201
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,924
Well, it's a good thing
you're not Mike, then.

202
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,795
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
And you'd be in constant pain.

203
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,100
Something's not right.
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer,

204
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,809
now all of a sudden,
he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?

205
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,351
And Dustin's MIA, too?

206
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,314
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.

207
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,444
What does it matter?

208
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,730
The bottom line is, they're not here.

209
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,734
- It's up to us.
- Up to us to do what exactly?

210
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,357
Find Billy and stop him.

211
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,204
Okay, yeah,
that's a really nice sentiment,

212
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,619
but even if El could find him again,
and that's a pretty big if, then what?

213
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,460
We burn the shit out of him
and make sure he doesn't escape this time.

214
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,253
- Okay, then what?
- Then we win.

215
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,869
No, see, that's the problem.

216
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,865
We don't. We don't win.

217
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,686
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before
and he just came right back.

218
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,550
We don't just have to stop Billy,
we have to stop the Mind Flayer.

219
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,510
- How in the hell do we do that?
- I don't know.

220
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,668
Maybe El does.

221
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,215
What are they still doing in there?

222
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,057
I don't know.

223
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,439
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.

224
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,484
Why?

225
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,016
- I mean, I don't know.
- They're conspiring against me.

226
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,827
- That's what you're concerned about now?
- It's not my main concern.

227
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,172
- It's just a sub-concern.
- I thought it was already over.

228
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,366
It's not over, okay?
We're just taking a break.

229
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,988
She said she dumped your ass.

230
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,195
- That doesn't sound like a break.
- It wasn't!

231
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,155
You guys do realize we can still hear
everything you're saying, right?

232
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,044
Conspiring.

233
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
I told you, they're conspiring.

234
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,714
Not now, Mom!

235
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,456
Mike, open the door.

236
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,638
Code red, I repeat, code red.

237
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,010
Does anyone copy?

238
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,677
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.

239
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,346
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
Does anyone copy?

240
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,146
We are innocent children
and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.

241
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,231
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins,
and if we are found,

242
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,897
they will torture and kill us.

243
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,026
Hey.

244
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,393
Gotta take it easy on that thing.
Gonna drain the battery.

245
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,027
- The mall just opened.
- So?

246
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,576
So someone could be in range.

247
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,409
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop
is gonna rappel down here

248
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,495
and save the day?

249
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,259
All right, why are you such a cranky pants

250
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,169
after getting to spend the night
with Robin?

251
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,000
Shh! Jesus Christ.

252
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,335
Will you just give up
on your creepy dream already?

253
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,881
I heard you guys talking all night.

254
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,084
We were trying to figure out a way
to open up the door

255
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,763
while you children were sleeping.

256
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,180
After eight hours,

257
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,564
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,

258
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,558
you know, probably just a little bit
of the reason why I'm feeling just...

259
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,385
a tad cranky.

260
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,476
What are you doing?

261
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,626
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm taking a leak. Look away.

262
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,690
Look away!

263
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,164
Can you redirect your stream, please?

264
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,788
Ugh.

265
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful!

266
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,782
We don't even know what that is.

267
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,377
Exactly. It could be useful.

268
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,844
Useful how?

269
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,183
We can survive down here a long time
without food,

270
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,389
but if the human body doesn't get water,
it will die.

271
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,761
I hate to break it to you,

272
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,597
but this is not water.

273
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,103
No, but it's a liquid,

274
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,975
and if it comes down to me
drinking that shit

275
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,402
or dying of thirst,

276
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,520
I drink.

277
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,615
We've got company.

278
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,303
You smell that?

279
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
What?

280
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,062
Piss.

281
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,389
Let's go.

282
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,266
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
- I'm going!

283
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,113
Henderson. Go, go.

284
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,345
Come on, Steve, let's go!

285
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,994
- Jesus Christ.
- Ooh!

286
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,539
You still wanna drink that?

287
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,746
Holy mother of God.

288
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,337
Well...

289
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,467
hope you guys are in good shape.

290
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,392
Looking at you, roast beef.

291
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,346
Let's go, come on.

292
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,765
Why me?

293
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,190
It was the same thing,

294
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,293
the exact same thing
that happened to Will last year.

295
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,857
And look at this.
Look at the body temperatures.

296
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,823
He likes it cold.

297
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,829
Okay, so this crazy old woman
who was eating fertilizer...

298
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,709
- Mrs. Driscoll.
- Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.

299
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,425
- What time was this attack?
- Last night.

300
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,865
Right, but what time last night?

301
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,955
- Around 9:00.
- You waited all night to call?

302
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,144
I was waiting for the doctors
to run some tests.

303
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,248
You weren't there?

304
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,626
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

305
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,592
Hallelujah!

306
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,671
Ooh.

307
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,933
Um, so, wha... what time was your...
sauna test?

308
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,049
Around 9:00.

309
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,219
Well, that proves it.
That proves my theory.

310
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,675
She's flayed, just like Billy.

311
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,095
- Flayed?
- The Mind Flayer. He flays people.

312
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,194
Takes over their mind.

313
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,478
Once they do that,
they basically become him.

314
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,152
- If there are two flayed...
- We have to assume there are more.

315
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,322
Heather.

316
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,693
Billy was doing something to her.

317
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,823
She was scared.

318
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,778
She was screaming.

319
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,448
Bad screams.

320
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,975
- What's a good scream?
- Max said...

321
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,957
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?

322
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,540
- She's a lifeguard at the pool.
- Heather Holloway?

323
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,835
Tom.

324
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,053
Seriously?

325
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,719
Welcome to my world.

326
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,522
Seat belts.

327
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,032
- Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close?
- What?

328
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,446
Can you not walk so close to me?
You stink.

329
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,121
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?

330
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,915
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?

331
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,249
Yeah, with me in it.

332
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,709
Well, I just want to remind you
of something, Joyce.

333
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,134
- I am not a mechanic.
- Yeah, clearly.

334
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,933
That's why you should've listened
to Alexei.

335
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,335
Oh, right, yeah.
Your new boyfriend, right?

336
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,756
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on
has to be my boyfriend.

337
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,056
Yeah, he reminds me a bit
of a Russian Scott Clarke.

338
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,180
Oh, here we go.

339
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,476
Maybe you should go on a date.
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?

340
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,268
- Whoa.
- What?

341
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,355
He's running.

342
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,779
You son of a bitch!

343
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,782
Hey! Smirnoff!

344
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,204
Get back here!

345
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,579
Hey! C'mere!

346
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,953
Hey, c'mere!

347
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,398
You all gonna pay for those?

348
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,042
So, what are you,
some kinda bounty hunter?

349
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,213
I'm a cop.

350
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,788
I'm undercover.

351
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,972
Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.

352
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,894
Yeah, I... I'm just checking on Will.

353
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,349
At the movies?

354
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,018
Just keep your mouth shut, all right?

355
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,776
All right, all right, hop in.
Come on, get in.

356
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,031
- Hey!
- Hey!

357
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,822
You "hey!" You "hey!"

358
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,195
This is a police emergency, all right?

359
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,368
I need to commandeer your vehicle.

360
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,831
What?

361
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,122
As long as there's a... a...

362
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,486
What is your name, sir?

363
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,001
- Todd.
- Todd?

364
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,254
- Yeah.
- Todd.

365
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,915
- Todd.
- Todd...

366
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,921
listen to me.

367
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,508
That man in there,

368
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,131
I know he doesn't look it,

369
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:33,097
but he is one of the most dangerous men
in the world.

370
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,808
He's, uh...

371
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,307
- murdered many children.
- What?

372
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,064
Yeah, he's a true psychopath.
I tracked him over two state lines.

373
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,307
Hey, what's going on?

374
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,896
Ah, Detective Byers.

375
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,863
Uh...

376
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,192
this is Todd.

377
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:52,164
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle
to transport our dangerous criminal.

378
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,830
Oh, yes, he... very dangerous, uh,

379
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,790
forger... er.

380
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,699
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.

381
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,707
- Child murderer?
- We should really get going.

382
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,989
Hey, how do I get my car back?

383
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,791
- You just call the station.
- What station?

384
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,416
Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!

385
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,514
Hey, what station?

386
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,258
You're doing the right thing!

387
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,295
Hey, what the... Hey!

388
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,137
Dude!

389
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,991
I mean, you have to admit,
as a feat of engineering alone,

390
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,360
this is impressive.

391
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,518
What are you talking about?
It's a total fire hazard.

392
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,025
There's no stairs, there's no exit,

393
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,295
there's just an elevator
that drops you halfway to hell.

394
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,149
They're Commies.

395
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,607
You don't pay people, they cut corners.

396
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,050
To be fair to our Russian comrades,

397
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,414
I don't think this tunnel was designed
for walking.

398
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,503
Think about it,
they developed the perfect system

399
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,698
for transporting that cargo.

400
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,746
It all comes into the mall
like any old delivery.

401
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,431
And then they load it up onto those trucks
and nobody's the wiser.

402
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,937
You think
they built this whole mall

403
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,171
so they could transport
that green poison?

404
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,715
I very seriously doubt
it's something as boring as poison.

405
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,027
It's gotta be much more valuable,
like promethium or something.

406
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,341
What the hell is promethium?

407
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,887
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make
Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.

408
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,853
You're all so nerdy,
it makes me physically ill.

409
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,614
No, no, no.
No, don't lump me in with them.

410
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,694
I'm not a nerd, all right?

411
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,440
Why so sensitive, Harrington?

412
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,583
Afraid of losing cool points
to a ten-year-old child?

413
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,237
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit
about Prometheus.

414
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,148
Promethium.

415
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,736
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure,
but whatever. All I'm saying is,

416
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,833
it's probably being used
to make something.

417
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,158
Or power something.

418
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,123
- Like a nuclear weapon?
- Totally.

419
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,293
Walking towards a nuclear weapon.
That's great.

420
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,712
- That'd be great.
- But if they're building something,

421
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,831
why here?

422
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,297
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places.

423
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,629
At the very best, we're a toilet stop
on your way to Disneyland,

424
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,926
but maybe that's it.
Maybe it's our very...

425
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,529
- You think the Russians know?
- About...

426
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,853
- They could.
- So it's connected?

427
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,060
- Maybe.
- How?

428
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,558
I don't know, but it's...

429
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Possible.

430
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,953
I'm sorry, is there something you'd
like to share with the class?

431
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,650
Walkie.

432
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,537
"A trip to China sounds nice.

433
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,751
If you tread lightly."

434
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,212
It's the code.

435
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,711
- Wherever that broadcast is coming from...
- It's close.

436
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,688
And if there's one thing we know
about that signal...

437
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,302
It can reach the surface.

438
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Let's go.

439
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,083
Tom?

440
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,086
Heather?

441
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,589
Jesus, it's freezing.

442
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,643
Do you guys smell that?

443
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,598
Oh.

444
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,346
Oh, God.

445
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,435
More chemicals.

446
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,068
You think they're guzzling this shit?

447
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,716
Yeah, either that or they just went on
a hell of a cleaning spree.

448
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,830
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.

449
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,160
- Did you?
- No.

450
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,905
This is something new.

451
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,165
Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit.

452
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,039
What happens
when you mix chemicals together?

453
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,846
You create a new substance.

454
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,158
- What if they're making something?
- In themselves?

455
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,400
I mean, come on,
if you drink this crap, it'll kill you.

456
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,844
Yeah, if you're human.

457
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,278
Blood.

458
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,117
Yesterday,

459
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,750
Tom had a bandage on his forehead.

460
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,804
He was attacked.

461
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,960
Call 91...

462
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,753
They must have tied them.

463
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,336
They must have taken them somewhere.

464
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Mrs. Driscoll.

465
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,007
She kept saying...

466
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,967
"I have to go back."

467
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,393
What if the flaying,

468
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,435
it's taking place somewhere else?

469
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,689
There must be a place
where all this started, right?

470
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,651
A source.

471
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,610
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.

472
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,242
If we can find the source,
then maybe we can stop him.

473
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,240
Or at least stop it from spreading

474
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,091
or doing whatever the hell he's doing
with those chemicals.

475
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,445
How do we find it?

476
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,040
Mrs. Driscoll.

477
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,040
If she wants to go back so badly,
why don't we let her?

478
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,991
...this guy comes up to me,

479
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,799
I'm just pumping gas over here,

480
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,054
and he... Hey, whoa!

481
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,635
Don't cross me right now!

482
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,096
Busy day?

483
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,357
You could say that.

484
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,439
Some psycho stole that dude's car.

485
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,734
What else?

486
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,279
- What?
- What else did he say?

487
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,241
This psycho?

488
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,382
No offense, but I already
went over all this with the cops.

489
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,656
I'm not a cop.

490
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,950
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev.

491
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,785
Oh, shit!

492
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,501
Don't look at them.

493
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,998
At me.

494
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,078
Tell me

495
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,587
about this psycho.

496
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,142
Come on, let's go.

497
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,388
Move it.

498
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,772
I thought you said this guy
was a journalist.

499
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,731
Yeah, he, uh... he was.

500
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,403
Was?

501
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,534
Look at the camera.

502
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,111
The camera, above you to the right.

503
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,947
Identify yourselves.

504
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,575
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers,

505
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,662
Smirnoff.

506
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,367
- Alexei.
- Alexei.

507
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,627
Surname.

508
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,340
I don't know.

509
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,708
Family name!

510
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,804
Yeah, I know. I told... I don't know, okay?

511
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,300
Open the damn door!

512
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,175
Hopper.

513
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,256
It's all right. Don't worry.

514
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,598
He's a little bit eccentric, but...

515
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,389
he's completely harmless.

516
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,769
Name.

517
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,112
Get that out of my face,

518
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,357
you bald American pig.

519
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,439
I may be bald,

520
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,113
but you're the one in handcuffs,

521
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,527
Soviet scum.

522
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,327
Hi, Jim.

523
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,331
Wait.

524
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,057
Watch it.

525
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,516
Silence, scum.

526
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,606
- How long is this gonna take, because I...
- No.

527
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,782
- No.
- No.

528
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,989
No, you do not get to question me.

529
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,821
You have dragged an enemy of the state
into my home

530
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,997
as carelessly as a child drags in shit
on his shoe.

531
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,118
I will search him until I am satisfied.

532
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,833
Jim. C'mere.

533
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,128
Just c'mere.
I need to talk to you.

534
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,211
Yeah, what?

535
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,836
- What?
- This is not gonna work.

536
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,143
- What do you mean?
- He's not eccentric, he's certifiable.

537
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,761
- Glass houses, Joyce.
- What?

538
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,678
- You know, pot calling the kettle black.
- Oh, come on.

539
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,477
- Excuse me!
- What?

540
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,061
Do me a favor
and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.

541
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,897
- Oh, oh, this?
- No, no, no.

542
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,282
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.

543
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,478
Spare me!

544
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,988
What is your problem?

545
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,780
Please, stop talking!

546
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,534
No! We have had a very long day.

547
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,656
We have been shot at,
nearly blown up,

548
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,714
walked God knows how many miles
in a hundred degree heat,

549
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,118
stole a car,

550
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,836
all while being chased
by this gigantic... psychopath,

551
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,378
all so we could bring him to you.

552
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,803
Because somehow, you're the closest person
who speaks Russian,

553
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,053
which I can't believe.

554
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,684
But that doesn't matter because,
unfortunately, we're here.

555
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,063
So, if you don't mind,

556
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,309
put that thing away,

557
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,980
stop behaving like a jackass,
and ask him what he's doing

558
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,021
that's making my magnets fall off
my damn fridge!

559
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,940
Please.

560
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,383
Okay, clear.

561
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,709
Clear, come on, let's go.

562
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,130
Okay, that was close.

563
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,842
- Too close.
- Relax.

564
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,844
All right? Relax. Nobody saw...

565
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,016
Shit.

566
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,441
Jesus!

567
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,533
- Red Dawn.
- I saw it.

568
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,778
- First floor, northwest.
- Saw what?

569
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
The comms room.

570
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,235
You saw the comms room?

571
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,161
Correct.

572
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,449
- Are you sure?
- Positive. The door was open for a second,

573
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,537
and I saw a bunch of lights
and machines and shit in there.

574
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,330
That could be a hundred different things.

575
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,416
I'll take those odds.

576
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,174
All right.

577
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,260
We're gonna move fast,
we're gonna stay low.

578
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,347
- Okay?
- Okay.

579
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,230
Shh!

580
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,317
Move it.

581
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,991
Let's go.

582
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,538
Sh, sh. Come on.

583
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,257
Tread lightly!

584
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,349
Tread lightly!

585
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,762
Who are you?

586
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,678
Silver cat... Silver cat.

587
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,313
I don't understand.

588
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,023
China?

589
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,583
Dude!

590
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,460
You did it!

591
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,248
You won a fight!

592
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,379
Jeez...

593
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,448
- What are you doing?
- Getting us our ticket out of here.

594
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,182
You want to walk all the way back?

595
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,869
Well, we can hang out for a little bit,
relax, have a picnic maybe.

596
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,313
Have a picnic?
We came here for the radio.

597
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,999
This plan is way better.
If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian,

598
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,863
that would've been our plan
in the first place.

599
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,975
- ...but I guess you're...
- Guys.

600
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,450
There's something up there.

601
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,204
Let's go.

602
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,592
Holy shit.

603
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,643
No, that is not mean.

604
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,273
That is honest.

605
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,809
She won't find out.

606
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,773
See, you're the only one who gon' tell...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me!

607
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,266
Where do you think you're going?

608
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,940
Oh, um...

609
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,025
I was just going to visit
my grandma again.

610
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,321
And... And this...

611
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,452
this is my family.

612
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,370
- Extended.
- I don't care who they are.

613
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,161
You know the rules.
Two visitors at a time.

614
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,535
- Yeah, but...
- Two!

615
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,326
Girl, this child has lost her mind.

616
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,786
She brought a whole zoo in here.

617
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,553
You know,

618
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,216
those things that I said yesterday, I...

619
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,023
I didn't mean them.

620
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,861
- I know.
- I don't think you're like those assholes.

621
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,689
At all.

622
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,728
I never have. I...

623
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,275
- I was just...
- Angry?

624
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,704
Which I still don't get.

625
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,490
I mean, I was just completely, utterly,

626
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,753
mortifyingly...

627
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,205
wrong.

628
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,828
Don't let that go to your head.

629
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,998
I won't.

630
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,587
I just look forward to you
never doubting me again.

631
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,396
Oh, come on, you piece of shit!

632
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,661
Thanks.

633
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,128
Dude, I think that was it.

634
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,014
That was what?

635
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,588
The olive branch.

636
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,009
The what?

637
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,967
Oh, my God.

638
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,721
You're hopeless.

639
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,023
Okay,

640
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,981
I'll distract Max,

641
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,441
get you an opening.

642
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,521
And then talk to her. All right?

643
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,806
Where is she?

644
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,404
I don't know.

645
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,609
- Are you sure this is the right room?
- Yeah.

646
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,280
She's gone home.

647
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,993
We were hoping you might come back.

648
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,287
Whose blood is that?

649
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,827
Tom, whatever you've done, it's not you.

650
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,747
He's making you do this.

651
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:47,921
Go!

652
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,175
Owie.

653
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,600
Go, go, go!

654
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,975
Run!

655
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,645
Yeah!

656
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,450
- Got it, two in a row.
- That was good, that was good.

657
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,445
- Best three in a row now.
- Hey.

658
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,118
Hi.

659
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,292
Does your species like M&amp;M's?

660
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,643
I like the new look, by the way.
It's cool.

661
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,805
Thanks.

662
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,857
Run!

663
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,446
This way, this way!

664
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,834
Nancy!

665
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,415
Hello? Hello?!

666
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,501
Here.

667
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,433
It's ringing.

668
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,890
I don't care how good her pie is.

669
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,221
No, I don't want her in my damn house.

670
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,597
Come on, pick up!

671
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,096
Nancy?

672
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,762
Hi there.

673
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,695
I'm here for you, Nancy Drew.

674
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,869
No!

675
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,091
Jonathan!

676
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,407
- You bitch.
- Nancy!

677
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,582
Run!

678
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,615
Help! Help!

679
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,959
Help!

680
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,252
Is anyone here?!

681
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,296
Nancy.

682
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,764
Nancy!

683
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,597
Where are you going?

684
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,513
Yoo-hoo.

685
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,433
Nancy Drew, where are you?

686
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,155
Nancy.

687
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,007
Marco...

688
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,545
Marco...

689
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,554
Polo!

690
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,635
Huh?

691
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,120
Go... to... hell!
