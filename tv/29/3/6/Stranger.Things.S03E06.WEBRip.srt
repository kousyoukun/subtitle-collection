1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,641
The gate.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,769
I don't understand.
You've seen this before?

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,479
- Not exactly.
- Then what, exactly?

4
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,773
- All you need to know is it's bad.
- It's really bad.

5
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,900
Like, end-of-the-human-race-as-we-know-it
kind of bad.

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,402
And you know about this how?

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,280
Um, Steve? Where's your Russian friend?

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,909
Shit.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,831
Halt! Halt!

10
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,458
Shit.

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,334
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,420
Move! Let's move!

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,175
Go! Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

14
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,384
Go, go, go!

15
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,643
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

16
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,146
Holy shit! Holy shit! Shit!
Holy shit! Holy shit!

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,813
Holy shit!

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,901
- Guards! Go!
- This way!

19
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,613
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Whoa!

20
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,617
- Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!
- Come on!

21
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,368
- Shit!
- This way!

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,287
- Come on, quick!
- Hold the door!

23
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,124
Robin!

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,626
Shit!

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,048
- Help me, come on!
- Here! Come on, let's go!

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,675
- Come on!
- Go! Just get out of here!

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,760
Go, come on, now!

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,845
No! Just go get some help, okay?

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,055
What are you doing?!

30
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,598
Go!

31
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,682
I won't forget you!

32
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,934
Go!

33
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,538
He's here.

34
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,007
- Shit.
- Nancy!

35
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:14,884
Run!

36
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,969

37
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,471

38

Hey, hey, hey! Two at a time!

41
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,100
Oh, my God.

42
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,817
Jonathan...

43
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,321
No! Nancy!

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,406
Jonathan!

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,163
No, no! Nancy!

46
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,292
Stairs.

47
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,628
Goddamn it!

48
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,293
- Jesus!

49
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,439
- Go.
- Nancy!

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,192
Are you okay? Are you okay?

51
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,913

Excuse me. Excuse me.

61

What... what are you doing?
What's... what's this doing here?

62
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,937
- What?
- Your stand.

63
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,356
It's right in the main thoroughfare.

64
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,691
Where do you want it, sir?

65
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,445
Over there with the rest
of the goddamn food stalls.

66
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,530
It isn't rocket science.

67
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,074
Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself?

68
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,089
<i>My friends in state PD,</i>

69
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,884
highway patrol,
they're all on the lookout.

70
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,094
I got eyes everywhere.

71
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,637
The second he pops up...

72
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,681
I get a call.

73
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,057
A call?

74
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes. A call.

75
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,854
I mean, what more do you people
want me to do?

76
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,439
We want you to find him.

77
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,525
Let me explain something to you.

78
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,737
This man is a moron, okay?

79
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,948
He's driving around in
a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes.

80
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,533
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

81
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,202
I will find him.

82
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,703
And, when I do,

83
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,165
may I suggest
you bring some backup with you this time?

84
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,876
- Backup.
- Some comrades.

85
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,794
Since last time, he got the better of you.

86
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,013
Please...

87
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,182
I... I didn't mean that.

88
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,267
You... You don't need backup.

89
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,686
This man is your fault,

90
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,063
your problem.

91
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,482
You're lucky you still breathe.

92
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,859
Very lucky.

93
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,238
Please.

94
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,781
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,658
I... I have a bad temper.

96
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,994
I'm going to therapy.

97
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,205
You have one day to find this man for me.

98
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,706
Nod if you understand.

99
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,400
<i>Two Whoppers,</i>

100
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,320
extra ketchup, large fry,

101
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,031
pack of Marlboro Reds,

102
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,741
and one extra-large...

103
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,702
Slurpee.

104
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,957
Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven,
by the way.

105
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,333
Never said it was.

106
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,586
Let's try this again. Joyce.

107
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:47,920
Alexei,

108
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,089
the generators,

109
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,757
what are they powering?

110
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,720
And tell him that we know
it is not the Starcourt Mall,

111
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,848
so he can stop selling us that crap.

112
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,893
Those generators you were
working on, what are you powering?

113
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,271
We know it's not the mall.

114
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,691
This tastes like
shit strawberry.

115
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,943
- What'd he say?
- He says,

116
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,194
"It's strawberry."

117
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,321
I'm sorry?

118
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,032
His... Slurpee.

119
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,408
He says it's strawberry.

120
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:20,995
So what?

121
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,165
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...

122
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,875
Well, they didn't have cherry.

123
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,668
They didn't have it.

124
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,837
And it doesn't matter,

125
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,839
because it all tastes the same, okay?

126
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,550
It is sugar on ice. You tell him that.

127
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,593
Tell him what?

128
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,138
You tell him that it all tastes
the goddamn same!

129
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,516
It's all the same.

130
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,228
Sugar on ice. No difference.

131
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,023
Tell that stupid man
it is not the same in the slightest,

132
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,401
and I would like the cherry I requested.

133
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,070
He respectfully disagrees.

134
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,655
It's not the same at all,

135
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,490
and he would like...

136
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,908
cherry.

137
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,370
Oh, yeah? You tell him...
he can forget it.

138
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,459
He says forget it. No cherry.

139
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,133
No cherry, no deal.

140
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,262
He says,

141
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
"No cherry...

142
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,807
no deal."

143
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,187
Yeah.

144
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,689
Hm.

145
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,400
Mm.

146
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,901
Oh, shit!

147
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,028
No, Hop...

148
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,947
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

149
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,366
- I'm not gonna hurt him!
- What are you doing?

150
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,619
Come on! Come on!

151
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,996
I'm just giving him an opportunity

152
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,667
to get his own damn...

153
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,795
cherry Slurpee!

154
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,142
Jim, that man is an enemy of the state.

155
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,728
Yeah, who's been jerking us around
for a full day!

156
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,272
I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what?

157
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:15,276
He wants a helicopter to charter him
to his own private island.

158
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,362
I have dealt with assholes like this

159
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,156
my entire life.

160
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,704

162
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,290
He stuck with us.

163
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,125
Why do you think that is?

164
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,877
It's because...

165
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,963
he's scared.

166
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,594
<i>He's scared.</i>

167
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,387
Not of us,

of them.

169

00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,770
who could've killed him
just as easily as us.

171
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
Smirnoff knows

172
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,691
that if he runs back to his comrades
without a scratch on him,

173
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,485
they're gonna think that
he spilled his guts.

174
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,780
So, whether he likes it or not, we...

175
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,449
are the best chance he's got.

176
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,700
Ooh!

177
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,412
I give him 30 seconds
before he comes knocking on that door,

178
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,831
right back into our arms,

179
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,417

00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,515
So, when we set fire to the hub,

208
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,560
we drew the Demodogs away
so El could close the gate.

209
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,353
But now, for some insane reason,

210
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,439
the Russians appear to be trying
to reopen it,

211
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,150
which just destroys everything
we risked our lives for.

212
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,360
By "we," you're including Lucas?

213
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,403
Yes, of course.

214
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,531
So, all that shit you told me,
Lucas was there?

215
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,534
- Yeah.
- My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair?

216
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,493
Yes!

217
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,912
I don't believe you.

218
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,998
Wait, so you believe everything about El
and the gate

219
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,541
and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer,

220
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,085
but you question
your brother's involvement?

221
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,712
That's correct.

222
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,297
Makes total sense.

223
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,091
- Um, you need help with that?
- No.

224
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,928
- Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so...
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

225
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,473
All right, so if we don't find a more
efficient method to stop these fans,

226
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,935
we're never gonna find help,
and your ice cream buddies are screwed.

227
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,729
Yeah, with that attitude, they are.
Jee-zus!

228
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,272
I'm just being realistic.

229
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,944
I mean, we've made it about
point-three miles in nine hours.

230
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,196
Then we had to walk three hours
down that tunnel,

231
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,991
so I'd estimate ten miles back
to the elevator,

232
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,079
which should take us approximately
twelve-and-a-half days.

233
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,665
Did you just do all of that in your head?

234
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,874
I'm good with numbers.

235
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,210
Holy shit. You're a nerd.

236
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,252
Come again?

237
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,089
You... are... a... nerd.

238
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,384
- Okay, you better take that back, nerd.
- Can't put the truth back in the box.

239
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,303
- But it's not the truth.
- Let's examine the facts, shall we?

240
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,139
Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.

241
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,183
That was
a pretty straightforward equation.

242
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,394
Fact number two:
you're a political junkie.

243
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,980
Just because I don't agree
with Communism as an ideology...

244
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,941
Fact number three:
you love <i>My Little Pony.</i>

245
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,568
And what does <i>My Little Pony</i>
have to do with this?

246
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,571
Ah, let's recall the ponies'
latest adventure, shall we?

247
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,198
The evil centaur team and Tirek

248
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,617
turns Applejack into a dragon
at Midnight Castle,

249
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,161
and then Megan and the other ponies
have to use Moochick's magic

250
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,579
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,

251
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,540
saving them from a lifetime
of enslavement.

252
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,209
All the pink in the world can't disguise
the irrefutable fact

253
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,087
that centaurs and castles
and dragons and magic

254
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,797
are all standard nerd tropes.

255
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,174
Ergo, <i>My Little Pony</i> is nerdy.

256
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,719
Ergo, you, Erica,

257
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,636
are a nerd.

258
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,888
And how do you know so much
about <i>My Little Pony?</i>

259
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,765
Because I'm...

260
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,142
a nerd.

261
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,565
Let's go...

262
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,691
nerd.

263
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,193
You...

264
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,326
That one stung.

265
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,996
Who do you work for?

266
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,330
For the millionth time,
I work at Scoops Ahoy!

267
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,000
Scoops Ahoy.

268
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,211
What the hell?!

269
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,047
Look at my outfit!

270
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,506
Look at my outfit!

271
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,718
You think I just wear this?!
Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform?

272
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,805
How did you get in?

273
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
I already told you.

274
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,893
I told you before.

275
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,311
My delivery didn't come,

276
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,105
and my friends and I, we thought that
it was left at the loading dock,

277
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,609
so we went in the room,
and then it turned into an elevator,

278
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,195
and then... and then we dropped and then,

279
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,613
next thing we know,
I open my eyes,

280
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,531
and we're in this...

281
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,492
wonderful facility.

282
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,119
But I swear to God,

283
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,288
nobody knows about us,
nobody saw us.

284
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,831
You could just let us go, all right?

285
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,292
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this,
okay?

286
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,919
Shit happens, life goes on.

287
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,921
And, uh... ice... ice cream.

288
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,380
Ice cream, okay?

289
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,092
You guys know what ice cream is.
Everybody loves ice cream.

290
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,053
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream
or if that's considered gelato.

291
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,139
I don't know what's what,
but whatever you guys want, seriously.

292
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,308
USS Butterscotch,
I mean, you gotta try it.

293
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,644
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya!

294
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,153
I like this guy!

295
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,825
"USS... Butterscotch."

296
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,252
Who do you work for?

297
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,423
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously...

298
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,519
Get your hands off me!

299
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,439
Hey...

300
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,899
Steve?

301
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,609
Steve? Steve?

302
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,819
Steve?

303
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,072
What did you do to him? What did you do?

304
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,785
Put them in the chairs.

305
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,581
Don't touch me!

306
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,874
Steve...

307
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,584
Steve, wake up. Steve?

308
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,421
What did you do?!

309
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,634
Don't touch him.

310
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,305
Steve? Steve, can you hear me?

311
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,349
I think your friend
need a doctor.

312
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
Good thing...

313
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,066
we have the very best.

314
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,916
You are going to regret that,
little bitch.

315
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,256
Bastards.

316
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,091
Let us outta here!

317
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,345
Bastards! Let us out! Let us out!

318
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,578
It can't be good for her
to be in there for this long.

319
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,997
Mike, you need to relax.

320
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,498
What if she gets brain damage
or something?

321
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,793
- Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?
- No, it's not. He made it up.

322
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,169
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.

323
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,879
- Oh, and you do?
- No, I...

324
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,631
Yes, from <i>The Hawkins Post.</i>

325
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,800
I... I called a couple days ago about the...

326
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,927
Yes, yes, um...

327
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:48,307
I was just... following up
to see if anything else had gone missing,

328
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,100
or if... Okay.

329
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,852
Um, sorry to bother...

330
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,317
- Who's next?
- There is no next.

331
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,694
Unless you want to start calling
random people's homes.

332
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,113
- It doesn't make sense.
- What part of any of this makes sense?

333
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,408
There's a pattern, okay?
A consistency to their behavior.

334
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,785
They've been feeding on these chemicals
since this started,

335
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,662
and... and, what, they just stop,
out of the blue?

336
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,873
Maybe they have all the chemicals
they need.

337
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,042
Maybe they've all turned into those...
things.

338
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,626
But what about the source?

339
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,380
I mean, did the Mind Flayer
just suddenly stop infecting people?

340
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,551
And even if the flayed are monsters now,
why can't El find them?

341
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,636
Okay, can you guys settle an argument
for us?

342
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,639
Who do you think should decide
El's limits?

343
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,058
Mike or Eleven?

344
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,143
The way that you frame that
is such bullshit.

345
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,812
It's not bullshit, Mike.
This is your whole problem.

346
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,273
And it's also precisely the reason why
she dumped your ass.

347
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,358
El dumped you?

348
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,568
Yeah, because she is conspiring
against me.

349
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,527
She's corrupting her.

350
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,779
No, enlightening her.

351
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,405
The fact is, she's not yours.

352
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,991
She's her own person,
fully capable of making her own decisions.

353
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,868
She's risking her life for no reason.

354
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,786
For no reason?

355
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,246
Mike, the flayed are out there
doing God knows what.

356
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,083
- Killing, flaying...
- Transforming into monsters.

357
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,501
And El's not stupid.

358
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,711
She knows her abilities
better than any of us.

359
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,172
- Exactly, thank you.
- And she is her own person.

360
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,590
- Exactly.
- With her own free will.

361
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,800
Exactly.

362
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,844
El has saved the world twice,
and Mike still doesn't trust her.

363
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,181
You wanna talk about trust, really?
After you made Eleven spy on us?

364
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,558
- Wait, what?
- Oh, she didn't tell you this?

365
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,977
- No.
- Your girlfriend used El's powers

366
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,438
- to spy on us.
- No, no, no, I did not <i>make</i> her.

367
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,648
It was <i>her </i>idea.

368
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,691
And why are we even talking about this,
seriously?

369
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,901
Yeah, who cares?

370
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,819
- I care.
- Yeah.

371
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,822
- I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.
- We were just joking around.

372
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,741
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was
taking a massive shit or something?

373
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,035
- You weren't.
- But what if I was?

374
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,703
- Then gross!
- Seriously, Mike?

375
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,581
I'm just trying to demonstrate
how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

376
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,958
In fact, how careless all of you are.

377
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,544
You're treating her like some kind
of machine when she's not a machine,

378
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,337
and I don't want her to die
looking for the flayed

379
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,256
when they've obviously vanished
off the face of the Earth.

380
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,966
So can we please just come up
with a new plan

381
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,968
because I love her
and I can't lose her again.

382
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,769
What's going on?

383
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,479
Nothing. Nothing.

384
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,856
Just a family discussion.

385
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,149
Oh.

386
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,653
I found him.

387
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,406
Found who?

388
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,914
He calls it the key,
and this key emits a great energy.

389
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,669
It requires much strength, power.

390
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,424
Those houses,
like the one you found,

391
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,135
they're located near, uh, transformers.

392
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,096
They're stealing
from your town's power grid.

393
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,475
Why build this key here? Why are they not
doing this in their own backyard?

394
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,518
What are they trying to do,
blow us to smithereens?

395
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,989
There were many of these, uh, keys before
in Russia,

396
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,158
but they turned out wrong.

397
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,411
They had to come to where the...
where the, uh...

398
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,829
Where the what?

399
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,373
- I don't understand what he's saying.
- I thought you were fluent.

400
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

401
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,377
Are my free translation services
not good enough for you?

402
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,422
Because you can just go ahead
and file your complaint

403
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,090
right up my ass!

404
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,093
What is Smirnoff doing?

405
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,013
He's showing me.

406
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,183
Oh, okay.

407
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,477
Uh, he says the straw,

408
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,939
they're using it to penetrate a hole

409
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,358
in... a box?

410
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,739
Okay, sorry, sorry.

411
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,825
The straw represents the key,
which emits a great energy.

412
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,497
They're using this energy...

413
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,709
to break through a barrier,

414
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,003
to open...

415
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,421
a doorway.

416
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,424
A doorway between worlds.

417
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,103
But it seems this key
was only half the equation.

418
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,356
Location... Location was the other half.

419
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,653
Oh, what...

420
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,992
In Hawkins,
this door had been opened once.

421
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,371
It was still...

422
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,707
healing.

423
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,005
Jesus Christ.

424
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,549
So, this door is open now?

425
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,847
He says it is...

426
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,724
opening.

427
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,941
- Where are you going?
- To call our children.

428
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,447
Can we watch <i>Looney Tunes</i> now?

429
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,948
<i>Nyet.</i>

430
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,542
- Can I help you with something?
- Whiskey.

431
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,962
- You have whiskey?
- No, but I do have vodka.

432
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,445
Oh!

433
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,533
If there's a way to start this key,
there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?

434
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,868
Turn it off?

435
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,125
- Right.
- Right?

436
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,131
The key, is there a way to turn it off?

437
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,553
He says,
"Of course he could turn it off. Could...

438
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,973
Edison not turn off a lamp,
could Bell not hang up a phone?"

439
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,184
Cocky bastard. "But..."

440
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,602
But what?

441
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,896
But he is now...

442
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,564
"naked."

443
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,985
Sorry, "exposed." Compromised.

444
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,280
Hey, I will get you there.

445
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,325
I will get you to your key.

446
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,716
You wanna ask him what the hell's
so funny about that?

447
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,016
He says he likes your courage.

448
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,601
You remind him of a...

449
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,229
Fat Rambo.

450
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,819
But he says that even thin Rambo
couldn't get there.

451
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,574
This key, it is in an underground fortress

452
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,994
designed by the greatest Russian minds,

453
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,955
guarded by their greatest warriors.

454
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,001
Breaking in is...

455
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,170
impossible.

456
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,224
Jackpot.

457
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,570
Oh-ho-ho!

458
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,656
Do you even know how to drive?

459
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,742
How hard can it be? Max did it.

460
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,203
- Aw, come on.
- You seriously thought

461
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,705
- they'd just leave keys in there?
- There's gotta be a spare.

462
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,134
- Hey, Dustin?
- Yeah?

463
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,346
How big did you say that Demogorgon was?

464
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,306
Big. Nine feet or so. Why?

465
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,945
Found 'em.

466
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,281
Erica?

467
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,575
What the hell is that?!

468
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,868
A deadly weapon.

469
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,203
Could be useful.

470
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,414
- For what?
- What do you think?

471
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,667
Taking down Commies, saving your friends.

472
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,961
Thought you were more realistic than that,
nerd.

473
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,712
We don't even know where they are,

474
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,923
and even if we did,
there are a million guards up there

475
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,842
with weapons way deadlier than that.

476
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,679
The best thing we can do for them
is to get out of here and find help.

477
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,721
Easy with that.

478
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,558
Our chance of surviving, and theirs,
rises substantially.

479
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,560
Just trust me on this. Please?

480
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,068
Help!

481
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,238
Help!

482
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,034
- Help!
- Hey, would you stop yelling?

483
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,703
Steve! Oh, my God!

484
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,454
Steve...

485
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,957
Are... Are you okay?

486
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,251
My ears are ringing,
and I can't really breathe,

487
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,461
my eye feels
like it's about to pop out of my skull,

488
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,132
but, you know, apart from that,
I'm doing pretty good.

489
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,011
Well, the good news is that
they're calling you a doctor.

490
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,390
Is this his place of work?

491
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,100
I love the vibe.

492
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,018
Charming.

493
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,520
Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay,

494
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,523
do you see that table over there
to your right? No, your other right.

495
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,900
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.

496
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,319
- And do you see those scissors?
- Uh-huh.

497
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,323
Yeah, well, I think that if we move
at the same time, we could get over there,

498
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,950
and then maybe I could kick the table
and knock them into your lap.

499
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,453
- And I could cut the binds.
- Yeah, and we could get out of here.

500
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,538
- Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that.
- Yeah.

501
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,206
Those morons. They left scissors in here?

502
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,208
- Yeah, morons.
- Total morons.

503
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,044
- Okay.
- Okay, so,

504
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,962
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.

505
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,340
- Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha.
- All right.

506
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,926
One, two, three.

507
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,095
- Okay, that worked.
- Okay.

508
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,680
- All right. Uh, let's try again.
- Right.

509
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,432
One, two, three.

510
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,060
- Holy shit, this is gonna work!
- We're close. Ready?

511
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,312
Okay, one, two, three.

512
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,111
It's okay, it's okay.

513
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,821
Don't cry. Robin.

514
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,951
Are you laughing?

515
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,579
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

516
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,247
I'm sorry!

517
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,085
I'm so sorry. It's just...

518
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,920
I can't believe...

519
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,256
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base

520
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,841
with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

521
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,761
- It's just too trippy, man.
- We're not gonna die.

522
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,304
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

523
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,640
Just... You gotta let me
just think for a second.

524
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,478
Do you remember, um,
Mrs. Click's sophomore history class?

525
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,856
What?

526
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,775
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity.

527
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,528
That's what us band dweebs called her.

528
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,489
It was first period,

529
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,660
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
so you were always late.

530
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,747
And you always had the same breakfast.

531
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,459
Bacon, egg, and cheese
on a sesame bagel.

532
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,795
I sat behind you

533
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,715
two days a week for a year.

534
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,675
Mister Funny.

535
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,593
Mister Cool.

536
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,680
The King of Hawkins High himself.

537
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,184
Do you even remember me
from that class?

538
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,356
Of course you don't.

539
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,985
You were a real asshole, you know that?

540
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,486
Yeah, I know.

541
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,447
But it didn't even matter.

542
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,240
It didn't matter that you were an ass.

543
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,783
I was still...

544
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,827
obsessed with you.

545
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,997
Even though all of us losers
pretend to be above it all,

546
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,458
we still just wanna be popular...

547
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,210
accepted,

548
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,462
normal.

549
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,424
If it makes you feel any better,
having those things isn't all that great.

550
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:13,009
Seriously.

551
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,011
It just baffles me.

552
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,429
Everything that people tell you
is important,

553
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,683
everything that people say
you should care about, it's all just...

554
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:24,145
Bullshit.

555
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,690
But I guess you gotta mess up
to figure things out, right?

556
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,900
I hope so.

557
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,320
I feel like my whole life has been...

558
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,864
one big error.

559
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,201
Yep.

560
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,786
At least it can't get any more messed up
than this.

561
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,331
You know, I wish I'd known you
in Click's class.

562
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,292
- Yeah?
- Really, I do.

563
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,462
Maybe you could've helped me
pass the class.

564
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,382
Maybe instead of being here,
I'd be on my way to college right now.

565
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,010
And I would have no idea

566
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,471
that there were evil Russians
beneath our feet,

567
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:02,600
and I would be happily slinging ice cream
with some other schmuck.

568
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,604
Gotta say, though,

569
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,356
I liked being your schmuck.

570
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,983
It was fun while it lasted.

571
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,069
It was.

572
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,744
Where were you two going?

573
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,340
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

574
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:38,594
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov
less painful.

575
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,772
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

576
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,941
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
What is that thing?

577
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,568
It will help you talk.

578
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,361
Did you even clean that thing?!

579
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,849
What's he doing now?

580
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,776
And that's not normal, right?

581
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,196
Billy staying in his room
on the Fourth of July?

582
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,614
No, that's not normal.

583
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,657
He wants us to find him.

584
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,159
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

585
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,787
If we go to Billy, then the rest
of the flayed know where we are.

586
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,998
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

587
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,208
We won't be surprised.

588
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,295
We'll know that they're coming,
and we will kick their flayed butts.

589
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,130
You mean El will kick their butts.

590
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,599
<i>Papa!</i>

591
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,600
No.

592
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,145
<i>Rainbow.</i>
<i>Three to the right, four to the left.</i>

593
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,356
<i>Sunflower. Rainbow.</i>

594
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,610
- It's too risky.
- Yeah, and unnecessary.

595
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,862
Killing the flayed
won't stop the Mind Flayer.

596
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,822
We have to find out where
it's spreading from.

597
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,866
We have to find the source.

598
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,034
Billy knows it.

599
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,577
Billy's been there.

600
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,080
To the source.

601
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,457
- Yeah, but...
- It's a trap. I know.

602
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,001
We can't go to Billy,

603
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,089
but I think there's another way.

604
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,259
A way for me to see where he's been.

605
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,561
El, I know you think you have to do this,
but you don't.

606
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,731
It's just,
you've only done this before once.

607
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,359
And your mom, she loved you,

608
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,611
and wanted you to know what happened.

609
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,239
And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased.

610
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,283
The Mind Flayer is in him.

611
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,994
He can't hurt me.

612
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,578
Not in there.

613
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,705
We don't know that.

614
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,709
Mike.

615
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,754
I need you to trust me.

616
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,343
Yeah.

617
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,095
Just... be careful.

618
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,619
Billy.

619
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,832
Can you hear me?

620
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,711
I want to see.

621
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,214
I want to see what happened.

622
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,058
Something's wrong.

623
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,482
Stop! No! No! No!

624
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,691
No!

625
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,065
<i>El, are you okay?</i>

626
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,359
Are you okay?

627
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,863
I'm okay.

628
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,448
What's going on?

629
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,992
I'm... on a beach.

630
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,703
Okay, I may be dense,

631
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,538
but the last I checked,

632
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,291
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.

633
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,251
What else do you see?

634
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,801
<i>A woman.</i>

635
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,471
She's...

636
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,764
pretty.

637
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,726
I...

638
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,687
I think she's looking at me.

639
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,524
Woo!

640
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,942
Yeah!

641
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,116
You did it!

642
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,784
There's...

643
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,453
a boy.

644
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,996
Did you see that?

645
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,247
Yeah, I saw that!

646
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,041
That was at least seven feet.

647
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,668
I don't know what it was,
but it almost gave me a heart attack.

648
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,878
Ten more minutes?

649
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,757
- Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.
- Okay.

650
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,259
But any longer than that,
Dad's gonna be mad, okay?

651
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,219
Okay!

652
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,555
Billy?

653
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,433
Watch out for rip currents!

654
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,809
I know.

655
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,645
It's Billy.

656
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,148
It's California.

657
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,858
It's a memory.

658
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,660
I think I see it.

659
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,287
The source.

660
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,271
Two minutes, Jim.

661
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,023
It's a secure line, but any longer
than that and they could trace you.

662
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,233
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.

663
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,442
What?

664
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,615
Philadelphia Public Library.

665
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,410
Uh...

666
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,870
This is Jim Hopper...

667
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,206
uh... police chief, Hawkins.

668
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,750
<i>I got this number</i>
<i>from Dr. Sam Owens.</i>

669
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,669
What is your identification code?

670
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,962
Identification code?

671
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:10,921
You don't know it?

672
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,172
You must be joking.

673
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,716
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.

674
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,175
I got it.

675
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,637
You wrote it down and kept it
in your wallet?

676
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,975
"Antique Chariot." Listen.

677
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,687
<i>Um, tell Owens that the Russkies</i>
<i>are opening the gate.</i>

678
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,771
Now, he'll know what that means.

679
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,607
Not about the Russkies,
but about the gate.

680
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,735
Tell him that there's an entrance
at Starcourt Mall.

681
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,194
<i>I know how to get in,</i>

682
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,821
but I need backup, a lot of backup.

683
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,658
Have him call me back here
at 618-625-8313.

684
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,243
Your message will be relayed.

685
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,832
- So, now what?
- Now, we, uh...

686
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,834
we wait.

687
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,169
You compromised me, Jim.

688
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,921
You do realize that, don't you?
I'm gonna have to relocate.

689
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,049
- How long do we wait?
- As long as it takes.

690
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,384
How can you just sit there being calm?

691
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,969
I am not calm!

692
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,721
Our kids are in danger!

693
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,806
You said they were at the festival!

694
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,809
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!

695
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,689
What are you doing? Joyce?

696
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,191
What are you doing?

697
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,736
Philadelphia Public Library.

698
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,862
Yes, hello.

699
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,823
Uh, this is,
uh, Antique Chariot's partner...

700
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,575
Wheelbarrow.

701
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,702
<i>I don't think Antique Chariot</i>

702
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,039
properly conveyed the urgency
of our situation.

703
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,374
What are you doing?

704
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,459
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.

705
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,753
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.
<i>- No.</i>

706
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,339
Don't you dare patronize me!

707
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,216
<i>I don't know who you are,</i>

708
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,968
if you're some glorified secretary
or what,

709
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,097
but if you don't wanna lose your job,
here's what's gonna happen.

710
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,390
When I hang up,

711
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,100
you're gonna get up off your ass,

712
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,811
<i>and you're gonna go find Owens</i>
<i>and tell him what's going on.</i>

713
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,106
We don't have time to talk about it
and neither does he.

714
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:56,402
He's gotta get to Hawkins,
and he's gotta bring his men right now!

715
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,986
Do you understand me?

716
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,238
Yes, yes, ma'am.

717
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,490
Thank you. And good day.

718
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,285
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.

719
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,912
That's one minute too long.

720
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,207
Alexei.

721
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,500
What's going on?

722
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,043
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.

723
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,670
Back to Hawkins. Come on.

724
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,171
Come on.

725
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,688
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.

726
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,356
Do you?

727
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,568
I mean, I... I feel fine.

728
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,154
- I feel normal.
- Yeah, I feel... I feel fine.

729
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,656
I kinda feel good.

730
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,910
- Wanna know a secret?
- What?

731
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,245
I like it, too!

732
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,584
- I feel good.
- Morons. They messed up the drug.

733
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,085
They messed it up!

734
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,047
- Morons. Hey, morons!
- Morons!

735
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,716
- Moron! Mor...
- Hey!

736
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,050
Whoa-oh!

737
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,970
Oh, no. There's definitely
something wrong with us.

738
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,889
Something's wrong.

739
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,992
Would now be a good time to tell you
that I don't like doctors?

740
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,955
Let's try this again, yes?

741
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,250
Who do you work for?

742
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,461
Scoops.

743
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,420
Scoops Ahoy.

744
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,299
How did you find us?

745
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,842
Totally by accident.

746
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,345
More lies.

747
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,061
- What is that shiny little toy?
- Where you going with that, doc?

748
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,022
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Wait! No! Wait! Wait!

749
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,608
- Whoa!
- There was a code! We heard a code!

750
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,151
Code.

751
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,237
What code?

752
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,530
"The week is long.

753
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,990
The silver cat feeds
when blue meets yellow in the west."

754
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,200
Blah, blah, blah.

755
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:13,413
You broadcast that stupid spy shit
all over town,

756
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,873
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,

757
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,417
and we cracked it in a day.

758
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,002
A day!

759
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,505
You think you're so smart,

760
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,509
but a couple of kids
who scoop ice cream for a living

761
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,887
cracked your code in a day,
and now, people know you're here.

762
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,014
Who knows we are here, little bitch?

763
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,224
Uh, well, Dustin knows.

764
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,433
Hey, Steve?

765
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,686
- Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
- Steve!

766
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,855
Dustin Henderson.

767
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,024
It is your small, curly-haired friend?

768
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,194
Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small.
Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah.

769
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,237
Where is he?

770
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,948
He's long gone, you big asshole.

771
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,533
And he's probably calling Hopper,

772
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,828
and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.

773
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,206
They're gonna come in here,
commando-style, guns a-blazin',

774
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,125
and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.

775
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,710
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.

776
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,091
Is that so?

777
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,009
Yeah.

778
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,588
Hey! Henderson!

779
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,590
That's crazy,
I was just talking about you.

780
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,634
- Oh, my God!
- Get ready to run.

781
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,748
Hey! Billy, stop!

782
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,501
What the hell is wrong with you?
What did we talk about, huh?

783
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,460
You gotta slide!

784
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,754
- I know.
- Wait.

785
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,173
- Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it?
- No.

786
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,717
Well, what then? What?

787
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,053
What did I raise, a pussy for a son?

788
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,097
- Leave me alone!
- Hey!

789
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,933
That's right, run!
Like you always do!

790
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,612
Where were you last night?
Where were you?

791
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,199
- I told you, I was with Wendy.
- Stop lying to me!

792
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,535
- I'm not lying to you!
- You saw him again, didn't you?

793
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,829
- Didn't you?!
- Get away from me!

794
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,748
- I said, get away!
- You... You whore!

795
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,833
- Stop it!
- Bitch!

796
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:03,959
- Don't hurt her!
- No!

797
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,752
- Don't hurt her!
- You bastard!

798
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,089
Mom!

799
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,550
I don't understand. Why not?

800
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,593
Please, Mom, don't do this.

801
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,803
Please come home.

802
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,890
No. How long? How long?!

803
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,434
I miss you.

804
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,019
Get back here!

805
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,065
Get up! What, are you scared to fight me?

806
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,442
You scared?

807
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,112
Get up and fight me, pussy! Pussy!

808
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,448
Billy, come over here,
I want you to meet someone.

809
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,784
This is your new sister.
Her name's Maxine.

810
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,286
Max.

811
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,788
- Shake her hand.
- Who's there?

812
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,167
- I said, shake her hand.
- I said, who's there?!

813
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,843
I think I found it.

814
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,096
The source.

815
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,722
Where, El? Where are you?

816
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,646
Brimborn...

817
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,648
Steelworks.

818
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,863
Here. Okay, uh, steelworks, steelworks...

819
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,365
Uh...

820
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,492
Here, steel.

821
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,701
Uh...

822
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,121
Found it.
6522 Cherry Oak Drive.

823
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,790
- That's close.
- El, El, we found it. Get out of there.

824
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,166
Get out.

825
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,027
Mike?

826
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,323
Mike?

827
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,492
Mike?

828
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:44,870
Mike!

829
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,456
Mike!

830
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,167
He can't hear you.

831
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,426
You shouldn't have looked for me.

832
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,597
Because now I see you.

833
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,438
Now we can all see you.

834
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,542
You...

835
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,961
let us in.

836
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,132
And now...

837
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,303
you are going to have to let us stay.

838
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,934
David, where you going?

839
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,352
David?

840
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,777
Adam!

841
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,904
You're gonna miss it!

842
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,697
Adam!

843
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,577
Don't you see?

844
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,454
All this time,

845
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,373
we've been building it.

846
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,416
We've been building it...

847
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,002
for you.

848
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,425
<i>All that work,</i>

849
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,095
all that pain...

850
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,349
all of it... for you.

851
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,692
And now it's time.

852
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,611
Time to end it.

853
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,281
And we are going to end you.

854
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,366
And when you are gone,

855
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,368
we are going to end your friends.

856
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,413
- No!
- And then we are going to end...

857
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,207
everyone.

858
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,710
Get away!

859
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,336
No!

860
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,006
El, you're okay. It's... It's okay.

861
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,299
El.
