1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,682
The gate.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,821
I don't understand.
You've seen this before?

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,483
- Not exactly.
- Then what, exactly?

4
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,833
- All you need to know is it's bad.
- It's really bad.

5
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,960
Like, end-of-the-human-race-as-we-know-it
kind of bad.

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,404
And you know about this how?

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,275
Um, Steve? Where's your Russian friend?

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,905
Shit.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,831
Halt! Halt!

10
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,457
Shit.

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,331
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,420
Move! Let's move!

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,183
Go! Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

14
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,378
Go, go, go!

15
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,641
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

16
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,147
Holy shit! Holy shit! Shit!
Holy shit! Holy shit!

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,809
Holy shit!

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,896
- Guards! Go!
- This way!

19
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,621
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Whoa!

20
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,618
- Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!
- Come on!

21
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,367
- Shit!
- This way!

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,412
- Come on, quick!
- Hold the door!

23
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,123
Robin!

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,792
Shit!

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,050
- Help me, come on!
- Here! Come on, let's go!

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,681
- Come on!
- Go! Just get out of here!

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,759
Go, come on, now!

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,853
No! Just go get some help, okay?

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,059
What are you doing?!

30
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,598
Go!

31
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,681
I won't forget you!

32
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,926
Go!

33
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,535
He's here.

34
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,009
- Shit.
- Nancy!

35
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:14,878
Run!

36
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,968
Damn!

37
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,595
Hey!

38
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,144
Come on!

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,310
Hey!

40
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,111
Hey, hey, hey! Two at a time!

41
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,266
Oh, my God.

42
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,818
Jonathan...

43
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,324
No! Nancy!

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,410
Jonathan!

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,163
No, no! Nancy!

46
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,289
Stairs.

47
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,668
Goddamn it!

48
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,287
- Jesus!
- What the f...

49
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,442
- Go.
- Nancy!

50
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,187
Are you okay? Are you okay?

51
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,996
It's time.

52
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,101
Hey! Excuse me.

53
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,807
Excuse me. Excuse me.

54
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,745
What... what are you doing?
What's... what's this doing here?

55
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,939
- What?
- Your stand.

56
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,356
It's right in the main thoroughfare.

57
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,690
Where do you want it, sir?

58
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,453
Over there with the rest
of the goddamn food stalls.

59
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,528
It isn't rocket science.

60
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,073
Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself?

61
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,086
My friends in state PD,

62
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,883
highway patrol,
they're all on the lookout.

63
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,088
I got eyes everywhere.

64
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,638
The second he pops up...

65
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,763
I get a call.

66
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,098
A call?

67
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,561
Yes. A call.

68
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,850
I mean, what more do you people
want me to do?

69
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,437
We want you to find him.

70
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,529
Let me explain something to you.

71
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,736
This man is a moron, okay?

72
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,950
He's driving around in
a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes.

73
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,532
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

74
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,197
I will find him.

75
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,702
And, when I do,

76
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,169
may I suggest
you bring some backup with you this time?

77
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,880
- Backup.
- Some comrades.

78
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,793
Since last time, he got the better of you.

79
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,054
Please...

80
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,182
I... I didn't mean that.

81
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,265
You... You don't need backup.

82
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,687
This man is your fault,

83
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,062
your problem.

84
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,475
You're lucky you still breathe.

85
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,861
Very lucky.

86
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Please.

87
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,781
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,664
I... I have a bad temper.

89
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,990
I'm going to therapy.

90
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,208
You have one day to find this man for me.

91
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,708
Nod if you understand.

92
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,402
Two Whoppers,

93
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,324
extra ketchup, large fry,

94
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,029
pack of Marlboro Reds,

95
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,735
and one extra-large...

96
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,697
Slurpee.

97
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,960
Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven,
by the way.

98
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,330
Never said it was.

99
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,587
Let's try this again. Joyce.

100
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,044
Alexei,

101
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,094
the generators,

102
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,762
what are they powering?

103
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,721
And tell him that we know
it is not the Starcourt Mall,

104
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,853
so he can stop selling us that crap.

105
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,890
Those generators you were
working on, what are you powering?

106
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,267
We know it's not the mall.

107
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,989
This tastes like
shit strawberry.

108
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,938
- What'd he say?
- He says,

109
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,187
"It's strawberry."

110
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,318
I'm sorry?

111
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,026
His... Slurpee.

112
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,435
He says it's strawberry.

113
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,004
So what?

114
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,168
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...

115
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,878
Well, they didn't have cherry.

116
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,666
They didn't have it.

117
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,839
And it doesn't matter,

118
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,840
because it all tastes the same, okay?

119
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,552
It is sugar on ice. You tell him that.

120
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,634
Tell him what?

121
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,136
You tell him that it all tastes
the goddamn same!

122
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,521
It's all the same.

123
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,229
Sugar on ice. No difference.

124
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,073
Tell that stupid man
it is not the same in the slightest,

125
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,396
and I would like the cherry I requested.

126
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,065
He respectfully disagrees.

127
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,663
It's not the same at all,

128
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,488
and he would like...

129
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,905
cherry.

130
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,371
Oh, yeah? You tell him...
he can forget it.

131
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,457
He says forget it. No cherry.

132
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,130
No cherry, no deal.

133
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,259
He says,

134
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,386
"No cherry...

135
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,972
no deal."

136
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,353
Yeah.

137
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,854
Hm.

138
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,399
Mm.

139
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,923
Oh, shit!

140
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,034
No, Hop...

141
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,952
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

142
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,372
- I'm not gonna hurt him!
- What are you doing?

143
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,619
Come on! Come on!

144
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,003
I'm just giving him an opportunity

145
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,670
to get his own damn...

146
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,797
cherry Slurpee!

147
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,137
Jim, that man is an enemy of the state.

148
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,725
Yeah, who's been jerking us around
for a full day!

149
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,271
I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what?

150
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:15,275
He wants a helicopter to charter him
to his own private island.

151
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,359
I have dealt with assholes like this

152
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,156
my entire life.

153
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,763
Yesterday in the woods,
he could've escaped,

154
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,907
but he didn't.

155
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,285
He stuck with us.

156
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,133
Why do you think that is?

157
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,884
It's because...

158
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,959
he's scared.

159
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,590
He's scared.

160
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,387
Not of us,

161
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,136
of them.

162
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,982
He's scared of
that seven-foot-tall Russian freak

163
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,768
who could've killed him
just as easily as us.

164
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
Smirnoff knows

165
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,693
that if he runs back to his comrades
without a scratch on him,

166
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,535
they're gonna think that
he spilled his guts.

167
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,778
So, whether he likes it or not, we...

168
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,451
are the best chance he's got.

169
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,696
Ooh!

170
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,414
I give him 30 seconds
before he comes knocking on that door,

171
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,828
right back into our arms,

172
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,418
with a new sense of humility.

173
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,629
- Jim...
- Uh...

174
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,474
I, uh, believe he has started the car.

175
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,092
Hopper.

176
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,055
You know, testing us.
He's just calling my bluff.

177
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,191
I believe he is now driving away.

178
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,739
Jim. Jim, move.

179
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,244
- Joyce, Joyce...
- Move, move, move!

180
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,198
I'm sorry, what did he say?

181
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,001
He says he likes strawberry, too.

182
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,515
So, when we set fire to the hub,

183
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,559
we drew the Demodogs away
so El could close the gate.

184
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,353
But now, for some insane reason,

185
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,437
the Russians appear to be trying
to reopen it,

186
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,152
which just destroys everything
we risked our lives for.

187
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,363
By "we," you're including Lucas?

188
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,444
Yes, of course.

189
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,526
So, all that shit you told me,
Lucas was there?

190
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,530
- Yeah.
- My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair?

191
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,618
Yes!

192
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,952
I don't believe you.

193
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,995
Wait, so you believe everything about El
and the gate

194
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,561
and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer,

195
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,085
but you question
your brother's involvement?

196
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,708
That's correct.

197
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,295
Makes total sense.

198
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,089
- Um, you need help with that?
- No.

199
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,925
- Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so...
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

200
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,471
All right, so if we don't find a more
efficient method to stop these fans,

201
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,936
we're never gonna find help,
and your ice cream buddies are screwed.

202
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,728
Yeah, with that attitude, they are.
Jee-zus!

203
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,272
I'm just being realistic.

204
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,936
I mean, we've made it about
point-three miles in nine hours.

205
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,197
Then we had to walk three hours
down that tunnel,

206
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,989
so I'd estimate ten miles back
to the elevator,

207
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,075
which should take us approximately
twelve-and-a-half days.

208
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,672
Did you just do all of that in your head?

209
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,868
I'm good with numbers.

210
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,208
Holy shit. You're a nerd.

211
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,293
Come again?

212
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,086
You... are... a... nerd.

213
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,382
- Okay, you better take that back, nerd.
- Can't put the truth back in the box.

214
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,297
- But it's not the truth.
- Let's examine the facts, shall we?

215
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,137
Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.

216
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,183
That was
a pretty straightforward equation.

217
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,386
Fact number two:
you're a political junkie.

218
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,977
Just because I don't agree
with Communism as an ideology...

219
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,943
Fact number three:
you love My Little Pony.

220
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,574
And what does My Little Pony
have to do with this?

221
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,572
Ah, let's recall the ponies'
latest adventure, shall we?

222
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,195
The evil centaur team and Tirek

223
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,621
turns Applejack into a dragon
at Midnight Castle,

224
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,221
and then Megan and the other ponies
have to use Moochick's magic

225
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,605
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,

226
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,543
saving them from a lifetime
of enslavement.

227
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,213
All the pink in the world can't disguise
the irrefutable fact

228
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,092
that centaurs and castles
and dragons and magic

229
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,800
are all standard nerd tropes.

230
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,170
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.

231
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,718
Ergo, you, Erica,

232
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,642
are a nerd.

233
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,890
And how do you know so much
about My Little Pony?

234
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,772
Because I'm...

235
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,266
a nerd.

236
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,731
Let's go...

237
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,857
nerd.

238
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,192
You...

239
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,332
That one stung.

240
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,998
Who do you work for?

241
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,329
For the millionth time,
I work at Scoops Ahoy!

242
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,166
Scoops Ahoy.

243
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,210
What the hell?!

244
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,048
Look at my outfit!

245
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,510
Look at my outfit!

246
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,720
You think I just wear this?!
Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform?

247
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,811
How did you get in?

248
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,469
I already told you.

249
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,886
I told you before.

250
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,306
My delivery didn't come,

251
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,155
and my friends and I, we thought that
it was left at the loading dock,

252
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,609
so we went in the room,
and then it turned into an elevator,

253
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,202
and then... and then we dropped and then,

254
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,638
next thing we know,
I open my eyes,

255
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,526
and we're in this...

256
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,489
wonderful facility.

257
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,121
But I swear to God,

258
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,293
nobody knows about us,
nobody saw us.

259
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,831
You could just let us go, all right?

260
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,285
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this,
okay?

261
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,915
Shit happens, life goes on.

262
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,922
And, uh... ice... ice cream.

263
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,379
Ice cream, okay?

264
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,151
You guys know what ice cream is.
Everybody loves ice cream.

265
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,095
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream
or if that's considered gelato.

266
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,136
I don't know what's what,
but whatever you guys want, seriously.

267
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,313
USS Butterscotch,
I mean, you gotta try it.

268
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,641
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya!

269
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,153
I like this guy!

270
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,826
"USS... Butterscotch."

271
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,249
Who do you work for?

272
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,417
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously...

273
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,521
Get your hands off me!

274
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,605
Hey...

275
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Steve?

276
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,613
Steve? Steve?

277
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,985
Steve?

278
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,072
What did you do to him? What did you do?

279
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,794
Put them in the chairs.

280
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,584
Don't touch me!

281
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,874
Steve...

282
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,577
Steve, wake up. Steve?

283
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,545
What did you do?!

284
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,632
Don't touch him.

285
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,308
Steve? Steve, can you hear me?

286
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,352
I think your friend
need a doctor.

287
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,186
Good thing...

288
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,069
we have the very best.

289
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,919
You are going to regret that,
little bitch.

290
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Bastards.

291
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,092
Let us outta here!

292
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,350
Bastards! Let us out! Let us out!

293
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,638
It can't be good for her
to be in there for this long.

294
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,002
Mike, you need to relax.

295
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,557
What if she gets brain damage
or something?

296
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,791
- Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?
- No, it's not. He made it up.

297
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,229
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.

298
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,883
- Oh, and you do?
- No, I...

299
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,633
Yes, from The Hawkins Post.

300
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,795
I... I called a couple
days ago about the...

301
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,933
Yes, yes, um...

302
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:48,311
I was just... following up
to see if anything else had gone missing,

303
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,102
or if... Okay.

304
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,853
Um, sorry to bother...

305
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,376
- Who's next?
- There is no next.

306
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,690
Unless you want to start calling
random people's homes.

307
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,172
- It doesn't make sense.
- What part of any of this makes sense?

308
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,406
There's a pattern, okay?
A consistency to their behavior.

309
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,811
They've been feeding on these chemicals
since this started,

310
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,722
and... and, what, they just stop,
out of the blue?

311
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,866
Maybe they have all the chemicals
they need.

312
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,036
Maybe they've all turned into those...
things.

313
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,625
But what about the source?

314
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,380
I mean, did the Mind Flayer
just suddenly stop infecting people?

315
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,554
And even if the flayed are monsters now,
why can't El find them?

316
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,644
Okay, can you guys settle an argument
for us?

317
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,642
Who do you think should decide
El's limits?

318
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,063
Mike or Eleven?

319
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,141
The way that you frame that
is such bullshit.

320
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,806
It's not bullshit, Mike.
This is your whole problem.

321
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,266
And it's also precisely the reason why
she dumped your ass.

322
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,357
El dumped you?

323
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,571
Yeah, because she is conspiring
against me.

324
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,531
She's corrupting her.

325
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,781
No, enlightening her.

326
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,412
The fact is, she's not yours.

327
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,009
She's her own person,
fully capable of making her own decisions.

328
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,865
She's risking her life for no reason.

329
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,791
For no reason?

330
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,249
Mike, the flayed are out there
doing God knows what.

331
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,080
- Killing, flaying...
- Transforming into monsters.

332
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,496
And El's not stupid.

333
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,714
She knows her abilities
better than any of us.

334
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,165
- Exactly, thank you.
- And she is her own person.

335
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,649
- Exactly.
- With her own free will.

336
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,803
Exactly.

337
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,843
El has saved the world twice,
and Mike still doesn't trust her.

338
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,178
You wanna talk about trust, really?
After you made Eleven spy on us?

339
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,561
- Wait, what?
- Oh, she didn't tell you this?

340
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,982
- No.
- Your girlfriend used El's powers

341
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,441
- to spy on us.
- No, no, no, I did not make her.

342
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,652
It was her idea.

343
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,691
And why are we even talking about this,
seriously?

344
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,895
Yeah, who cares?

345
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,824
- I care.
- Yeah.

346
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,822
- I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.
- We were just joking around.

347
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,785
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was
taking a massive shit or something?

348
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,035
- You weren't.
- But what if I was?

349
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,699
- Then gross!
- Seriously, Mike?

350
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,627
I'm just trying to demonstrate
how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

351
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,017
In fact, how careless all of you are.

352
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,603
You're treating her like some kind
of machine when she's not a machine,

353
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,397
and I don't want her to die
looking for the flayed

354
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,315
when they've obviously vanished
off the face of the Earth.

355
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,025
So can we please just come up
with a new plan

356
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,969
because I love her
and I can't lose her again.

357
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,765
What's going on?

358
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,483
Nothing. Nothing.

359
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,863
Just a family discussion.

360
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,314
Oh.

361
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,650
I found him.

362
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,406
Found who?

363
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,907
He calls it the key,
and this key emits a great energy.

364
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,667
It requires much strength, power.

365
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,422
Those houses,
like the one you found,

366
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,144
they're located near, uh, transformers.

367
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,097
They're stealing
from your town's power grid.

368
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,480
Why build this key here? Why are they not
doing this in their own backyard?

369
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,558
What are they trying to do,
blow us to smithereens?

370
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,988
There were many of these, uh, keys before
in Russia,

371
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,162
but they turned out wrong.

372
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,406
They had to come to where the...
where the, uh...

373
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,825
Where the what?

374
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,433
- I don't understand what he's saying.
- I thought you were fluent.

375
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,497
Oh, I'm sorry.

376
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,383
Are my free translation services
not good enough for you?

377
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,421
Because you can just go ahead
and file your complaint

378
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,086
right up my ass!

379
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,092
What is Smirnoff doing?

380
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,007
He's showing me.

381
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,224
Oh, okay.

382
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,476
Uh, he says the straw,

383
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,940
they're using it to penetrate a hole

384
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,362
in... a box?

385
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,744
Okay, sorry, sorry.

386
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,832
The straw represents the key,
which emits a great energy.

387
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,495
They're using this energy...

388
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,706
to break through a barrier,

389
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,002
to open...

390
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,419
a doorway.

391
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,424
A doorway between worlds.

392
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,095
But it seems this key
was only half the equation.

393
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,364
Location... Location was the other half.

394
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,648
Oh, what...

395
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,993
In Hawkins,
this door had been opened once.

396
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,370
It was still...

397
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,706
healing.

398
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,005
Jesus Christ.

399
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,548
So, this door is open now?

400
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,852
He says it is...

401
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,806
opening.

402
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,944
- Where are you going?
- To call our children.

403
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,453
Can we watch Looney Tunes now?

404
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,947
Nyet.

405
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
- Can I help you with something?
- Whiskey.

406
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,956
- You have whiskey?
- No, but I do have vodka.

407
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,453
Oh!

408
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,530
If there's a way to start this key,
there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?

409
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,874
Turn it off?

410
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,129
- Right.
- Right?

411
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,126
The key, is there a way to turn it off?

412
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,614
He says,
"Of course he could turn it off. Could...

413
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,965
Edison not turn off a lamp,
could Bell not hang up a phone?"

414
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,181
Cocky bastard. "But..."

415
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,597
But what?

416
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,898
But he is now...

417
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,730
"naked."

418
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,992
Sorry, "exposed." Compromised.

419
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,280
Hey, I will get you there.

420
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,331
I will get you to your key.

421
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,792
You wanna ask him what the hell's
so funny about that?

422
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,020
He says he likes your courage.

423
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
You remind him of a...

424
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,233
...fat Rambo.

425
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,816
But he says that even thin Rambo
couldn't get there.

426
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,570
This key, it is in an underground fortress

427
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,992
designed by the greatest Russian minds,

428
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,957
guarded by their greatest warriors.

429
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,998
Breaking in is...

430
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,294
impossible.

431
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,265
Jackpot.

432
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,567
Oh-ho-ho!

433
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,661
Do you even know how to drive?

434
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,740
How hard can it be? Max did it.

435
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,201
- Aw, come on.
- You seriously thought

436
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,726
- they'd just leave keys in there?
- There's gotta be a spare.

437
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,127
- Hey, Dustin?
- Yeah?

438
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,347
How big did you say that Demogorgon was?

439
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,309
Big. Nine feet or so. Why?

440
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,110
Found 'em.

441
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,447
Erica?

442
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,576
What the hell is that?!

443
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,869
A deadly weapon.

444
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,202
Could be useful.

445
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,410
- For what?
- What do you think?

446
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,668
Taking down Commies, saving your friends.

447
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,960
Thought you were more realistic than that,
nerd.

448
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,738
We don't even know where they are,

449
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,956
and even if we did,
there are a million guards up there

450
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,836
with weapons way deadlier than that.

451
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,675
The best thing we can do for them
is to get out of here and find help.

452
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,762
Easy with that.

453
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,555
Our chance of surviving, and theirs,
rises substantially.

454
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,561
Just trust me on this. Please?

455
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,073
Help!

456
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,236
Help!

457
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,034
- Help!
- Hey, would you stop yelling?

458
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,698
Steve! Oh, my God!

459
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,451
Steve...

460
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,959
Are... Are you okay?

461
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,296
My ears are ringing,
and I can't really breathe,

462
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,464
my eye feels
like it's about to pop out of my skull,

463
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,125
but, you know, apart from that,
I'm doing pretty good.

464
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,005
Well, the good news is that
they're calling you a doctor.

465
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,394
Is this his place of work?

466
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,103
I love the vibe.

467
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,023
Charming.

468
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,521
Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay,

469
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,524
do you see that table over there
to your right? No, your other right.

470
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,897
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.

471
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,323
- And do you see those scissors?
- Uh-huh.

472
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,322
Yeah, well, I think that if we move
at the same time, we could get over there,

473
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,010
and then maybe I could kick the table
and knock them into your lap.

474
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,512
- And I could cut the binds.
- Yeah, and we could get out of here.

475
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,536
- Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that.
- Yeah.

476
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,262
Those morons. They left scissors in here?

477
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,210
- Yeah, morons.
- Total morons.

478
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,042
- Okay.
- Okay, so,

479
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,957
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.

480
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,336
- Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha.
- All right.

481
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,933
One, two, three.

482
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,104
- Okay, that worked.
- Okay.

483
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,740
- All right. Uh, let's try again.
- Right.

484
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,434
One, two, three.

485
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,094
- Holy shit, this is gonna work!
- We're close. Ready?

486
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,313
Okay, one, two, three.

487
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,106
It's okay, it's okay.

488
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,815
Don't cry. Robin.

489
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,949
Are you laughing?

490
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,577
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

491
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,246
I'm sorry!

492
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,091
I'm so sorry. It's just...

493
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,924
I can't believe...

494
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,255
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base

495
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,840
with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

496
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,762
- It's just too trippy, man.
- We're not gonna die.

497
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,304
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

498
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,638
Just... You gotta let me
just think for a second.

499
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,483
Do you remember, um,
Mrs. Click's sophomore history class?

500
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,859
What?

501
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,780
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity.

502
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,529
That's what us band dweebs called her.

503
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,487
It was first period,

504
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,657
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
so you were always late.

505
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,749
And you always had the same breakfast.

506
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,458
Bacon, egg, and cheese
on a sesame bagel.

507
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,799
I sat behind you

508
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,723
two days a week for a year.

509
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,682
Mister Funny.

510
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,591
Mister Cool.

511
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,681
The King of Hawkins High himself.

512
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,177
Do you even remember me
from that class?

513
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,355
Of course you don't.

514
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,991
You were a real asshole, you know that?

515
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,488
Yeah, I know.

516
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,452
But it didn't even matter.

517
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,240
It didn't matter that you were an ass.

518
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,783
I was still...

519
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,834
obsessed with you.

520
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,003
Even though all of us losers
pretend to be above it all,

521
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,460
we still just wanna be popular...

522
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,293
accepted,

523
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,627
normal.

524
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,422
If it makes you feel any better,
having those things isn't all that great.

525
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,013
Seriously.

526
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,012
It just baffles me.

527
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,434
Everything that people tell you
is important,

528
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,683
everything that people say
you should care about, it's all just...

529
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,154
...bullshit.

530
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,693
But I guess you gotta mess up
to figure things out, right?

531
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,895
I hope so.

532
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,319
I feel like my whole life has been...

533
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,859
one big error.

534
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,196
Yep.

535
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,794
At least it can't get any more messed up
than this.

536
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,330
You know, I wish I'd known you
in Click's class.

537
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,285
- Yeah?
- Really, I do.

538
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,463
Maybe you could've helped me
pass the class.

539
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,384
Maybe instead of being here,
I'd be on my way to college right now.

540
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,006
And I would have no idea

541
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,474
that there were evil Russians
beneath our feet,

542
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:02,604
and I would be happily slinging ice cream
with some other schmuck.

543
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,601
Gotta say, though,

544
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,359
I liked being your schmuck.

545
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,984
It was fun while it lasted.

546
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,193
It was.

547
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,744
Where were you two going?

548
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,336
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

549
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:38,593
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov
less painful.

550
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,769
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

551
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,936
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
What is that thing?

552
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,574
It will help you talk.

553
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,360
Did you even clean that thing?!

554
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,849
What's he doing now?

555
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,783
And that's not normal, right?

556
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,200
Billy staying in his room
on the Fourth of July?

557
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,609
No, that's not normal.

558
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,657
He wants us to find him.

559
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,161
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

560
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,792
If we go to Billy, then the rest
of the flayed know where we are.

561
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,001
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

562
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,211
We won't be surprised.

563
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,295
We'll know that they're coming,
and we will kick their flayed butts.

564
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,128
You mean El will kick their butts.

565
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,604
Papa!

566
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,682
No.

567
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,148
Rainbow.
Three to the right, four to the left.

568
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,359
Sunflower. Rainbow.

569
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,609
- It's too risky.
- Yeah, and unnecessary.

570
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,863
Killing the flayed
won't stop the Mind Flayer.

571
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,816
We have to find out where
it's spreading from.

572
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,866
We have to find the source.

573
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,030
Billy knows it.

574
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,577
Billy's been there.

575
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
To the source.

576
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,463
- Yeah, but...
- It's a trap. I know.

577
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,001
We can't go to Billy,

578
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,090
but I think there's another way.

579
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,263
A way for me to see where he's been.

580
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,555
El, I know you think you have to do this,
but you don't.

581
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,725
It's just,
you've only done this before once.

582
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,355
And your mom, she loved you,

583
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,609
and wanted you to know what happened.

584
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,235
And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased.

585
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,281
The Mind Flayer is in him.

586
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,992
He can't hurt me.

587
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,576
Not in there.

588
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,712
We don't know that.

589
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,833
Mike.

590
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,746
I need you to trust me.

591
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,509
Yeah.

592
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,102
Just... be careful.

593
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,624
Billy.

594
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,834
Can you hear me?

595
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,713
I want to see.

596
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,212
I want to see what happened.

597
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,057
Something's wrong.

598
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,480
Stop! No! No! No!

599
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,685
No!

600
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,073
El, are you okay?

601
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,363
Are you okay?

602
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,856
I'm okay.

603
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,447
What's going on?

604
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,991
I'm... on a beach.

605
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,701
Okay, I may be dense,

606
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,543
but the last I checked,

607
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,287
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.

608
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,250
What else do you see?

609
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,803
A woman.

610
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,595
She's...

611
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,930
pretty.

612
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,850
I...

613
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,685
I think she's looking at me.

614
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,519
Woo!

615
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,938
Yeah!

616
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,122
You did it!

617
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,783
There's...

618
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,494
a boy.

619
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,996
Did you see that?

620
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,249
Yeah, I saw that!

621
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,043
That was at least seven feet.

622
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,728
I don't know what it was,
but it almost gave me a heart attack.

623
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,882
Ten more minutes?

624
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,761
- Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.
- Okay.

625
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,260
But any longer than that,
Dad's gonna be mad, okay?

626
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,343
Okay!

627
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,556
Billy?

628
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,430
Watch out for rip currents!

629
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,934
I know.

630
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,727
It's Billy.

631
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,150
It's California.

632
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,855
It's a memory.

633
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,658
I think I see it.

634
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,294
The source.

635
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,271
Two minutes, Jim.

636
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,083
It's a secure line, but any longer
than that and they could trace you.

637
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,267
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.

638
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,502
What?

639
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,619
Philadelphia Public Library.

640
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,409
Uh...

641
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,873
This is Jim Hopper...

642
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,214
uh... police chief, Hawkins.

643
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,750
I got this number
from Dr. Sam Owens.

644
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,667
What is your identification code?

645
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,962
Identification code?

646
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:10,915
You don't know it?

647
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,165
You must be joking.

648
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,716
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.

649
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,179
I got it.

650
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,639
You wrote it down and kept it
in your wallet?

651
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,975
"Antique Chariot." Listen.

652
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,688
Um, tell Owens that the Russkies
are opening the gate.

653
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,831
Now, he'll know what that means.

654
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,605
Not about the Russkies,
but about the gate.

655
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,740
Tell him that there's an entrance
at Starcourt Mall.

656
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,188
I know how to get in,

657
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,818
but I need backup, a lot of backup.

658
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,664
Have him call me back here
at 618-625-8313.

659
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,242
Your message will be relayed.

660
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,825
- So, now what?
- Now, we, uh...

661
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,875
we wait.

662
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,167
You compromised me, Jim.

663
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,922
You do realize that, don't you?
I'm gonna have to relocate.

664
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,045
- How long do we wait?
- As long as it takes.

665
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,382
How can you just sit there being calm?

666
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,968
I am not calm!

667
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,723
Our kids are in danger!

668
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,814
You said they were at the festival!

669
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,810
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!

670
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,689
What are you doing? Joyce?

671
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,193
What are you doing?

672
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,743
Philadelphia Public Library.

673
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,859
Yes, hello.

674
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,815
Uh, this is,
uh, Antique Chariot's partner...

675
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,576
Wheelbarrow.

676
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,699
I don't think Antique Chariot

677
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,036
properly conveyed the urgency
of our situation.

678
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,372
What are you doing?

679
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,457
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.

680
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,752
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.
- No.

681
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,336
Don't you dare patronize me!

682
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,222
I don't know who you are,

683
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,969
if you're some glorified secretary
or what,

684
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,102
but if you don't wanna lose your job,
here's what's gonna happen.

685
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,390
When I hang up,

686
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,103
you're gonna get up off your ass,

687
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,813
and you're gonna go find Owens
and tell him what's going on.

688
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,114
We don't have time to talk about it
and neither does he.

689
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:56,399
He's gotta get to Hawkins,
and he's gotta bring his men right now!

690
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,985
Do you understand me?

691
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,240
Yes, yes, ma'am.

692
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,491
Thank you. And good day.

693
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,294
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.

694
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,909
That's one minute too long.

695
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,248
Alexei.

696
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,500
What's going on?

697
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,040
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.

698
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,667
Back to Hawkins. Come on.

699
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,169
Come on.

700
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,688
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.

701
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,355
Do you?

702
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,565
I mean, I... I feel fine.

703
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,148
- I feel normal.
- Yeah, I feel... I feel fine.

704
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,663
I kinda feel good.

705
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,906
- Wanna know a secret?
- What?

706
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,254
I like it, too!

707
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,576
- I feel good.
- Morons. They messed up the drug.

708
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,087
They messed it up!

709
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,053
- Morons. Hey, morons!
- Morons!

710
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,721
- Moron! Mor...
- Hey!

711
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,049
Whoa-oh!

712
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,968
Oh, no. There's definitely
something wrong with us.

713
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,893
Something's wrong.

714
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,992
Would now be a good time to tell you
that I don't like doctors?

715
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,962
Let's try this again, yes?

716
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,251
Who do you work for?

717
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,461
Scoops.

718
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,544
Scoops Ahoy.

719
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,303
How did you find us?

720
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,842
Totally by accident.

721
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,385
More lies.

722
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,059
- What is that shiny little toy?
- Where you going with that, doc?

723
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,024
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Wait! No! Wait! Wait!

724
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,605
- Whoa!
- There was a code! We heard a code!

725
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,234
Code.

726
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,277
What code?

727
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,530
"The week is long.

728
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,993
The silver cat feeds
when blue meets yellow in the west."

729
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,204
Blah, blah, blah.

730
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:13,413
You broadcast that stupid spy shit
all over town,

731
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,897
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,

732
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,417
and we cracked it in a day.

733
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,000
A day!

734
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,506
You think you're so smart,

735
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,508
but a couple of kids
who scoop ice cream for a living

736
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,892
cracked your code in a day,
and now, people know you're here.

737
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,011
Who knows we are here, little bitch?

738
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,218
Uh, well, Dustin knows.

739
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,427
Hey, Steve?

740
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,687
- Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
- Steve!

741
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,859
Dustin Henderson.

742
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,018
It is your small, curly-haired friend?

743
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,188
Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small.
Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah.

744
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,278
Where is he?

745
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,950
He's long gone, you big asshole.

746
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,531
And he's probably calling Hopper,

747
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,826
and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.

748
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,211
They're gonna come in here,
commando-style, guns a-blazin',

749
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,130
and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.

750
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,708
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.

751
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,094
Is that so?

752
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,174
Yeah.

753
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,588
Hey! Henderson!

754
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,591
That's crazy,
I was just talking about you.

755
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,633
- Oh, my God!
- Get ready to run.

756
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,753
Hey! Billy, stop!

757
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,501
What the hell is wrong with you?
What did we talk about, huh?

758
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,464
You gotta slide!

759
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,753
- I know.
- Wait.

760
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,167
- Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it?
- No.

761
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,716
Well, what then? What?

762
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,051
What did I raise, a pussy for a son?

763
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,096
- Leave me alone!
- Hey!

764
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,927
That's right, run!
Like you always do!

765
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,605
Where were you last night?
Where were you?

766
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,196
- I told you, I was with Wendy.
- Stop lying to me!

767
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,802
- I'm not lying to you!
- You saw him again, didn't you?

768
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,832
- Didn't you?!
- Get away from me!

769
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,746
- I said, get away!
- You... You whore!

770
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,832
- Stop it!
- Bitch!

771
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:03,956
- Don't hurt her!
- No!

772
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,752
- Don't hurt her!
- You bastard!

773
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,091
Mom!

774
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,552
I don't understand. Why not?

775
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,592
Please, Mom, don't do this.

776
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,797
Please come home.

777
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,890
No. How long? How long?!

778
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,431
I miss you.

779
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,017
Get back here!

780
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,066
Get up! What, are you scared to fight me?

781
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,439
You scared?

782
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,105
Get up and fight me, pussy! Pussy!

783
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,445
Billy, come over here,
I want you to meet someone.

784
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,781
This is your new sister.
Her name's Maxine.

785
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,452
Max.

786
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,805
- Shake her hand.
- Who's there?

787
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,172
- I said, shake her hand.
- I said, who's there?!

788
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,837
I think I found it.

789
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,101
The source.

790
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,719
Where, El? Where are you?

791
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,686
Brimborn...

792
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,645
Steelworks.

793
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,855
Here. Okay, uh, steelworks, steelworks...

794
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,447
Uh...

795
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,574
Here, steel.

796
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,867
Uh...

797
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,122
Found it.
6522 Cherry Oak Drive.

798
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,794
- That's close.
- El, El, we found it. Get out of there.

799
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,249
Get out.

800
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,025
Mike?

801
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,406
Mike?

802
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,616
Mike?

803
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,035
Mike!

804
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,457
Mike!

805
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,220
He can't hear you.

806
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,432
You shouldn't have looked for me.

807
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,600
Because now I see you.

808
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,438
Now we can all see you.

809
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,583
You...

810
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,963
let us in.

811
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,134
And now...

812
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,295
you are going to have to let us stay.

813
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,934
David, where you going?

814
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,517
David?

815
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,776
Adam!

816
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,896
You're gonna miss it!

817
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,701
Adam!

818
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,578
Don't you see?

819
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,451
All this time,

820
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,367
we've been building it.

821
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,416
We've been building it...

822
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:15,996
for you.

823
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,466
All that work,

824
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,101
all that pain...

825
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,350
all of it... for you.

826
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,686
And now it's time.

827
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,606
Time to end it.

828
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,278
And we are going to end you.

829
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,374
And when you are gone,

830
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,369
we are going to end your friends.

831
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,411
- No!
- And then we are going to end...

832
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,213
everyone.

833
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,714
Get away!

834
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,337
No!

835
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,014
El, you're okay. It's... It's okay.

836
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,423
El.
