96
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,580
鉴于上一次他可是让你大败而归
Since last time, he got the better of you.

97
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,030
求你了
Please...

98
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,410
我不是这个意思
I-I didn't mean that.

99
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,680
你不需要增援
You-you don't need backup.

100
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,950
这个人是你的错
This man is your fault,

101
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,230
是你惹的麻烦
your problem.

102
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,940
你该庆幸你还活着
You're lucky you still breathe.

103
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,460
非常庆幸
Very lucky.

104
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,350
求你了
Please.

105
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,680
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,930
我脾气不好
I-I have a bad temper.

107
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,940
我会去心理治疗
I'm going to therapy.

108
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,490
给你一天时间给我找到这个人
You have one day to find this man for me.

109
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,120
听懂了就点头
Nod if you understand.

110
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,740
两个特大汉堡
Two Whoppers,

111
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,690
多加番茄酱  大份薯条
extra ketchup, large fry,

112
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,340
一包红万宝路香烟
pack of Marlboro Reds,

113
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,360
还有一份超大杯的
and one extra-large...

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,640
思乐冰
Slurpee.

115
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,140
汉堡王比起711便利店的口味差多了
Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven, by the way.

116
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,300
我又没说过它好
Never said it was.

117
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,860
再来试试吧  乔伊
Let's try this again. Joyce.

118
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,270
阿列克西  这些发电机
Alexei, the generators,

119
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,880
在给什么供能
what are they powering?

120
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,760
还有告诉他  我们知道不是给星庭商场的
And tell him that we know it is not the Starcourt Mall,

121
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,240
让他别再给我们搪塞些废话
so he can stop selling us that crap.

122
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,980
你研究的这些发电机是在给什么东西供能
Those generators you were working on, what are you powering?

123
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,280
我们知道这不是给商场供电
We know it's not the mall.

124
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,080
这是该死的草莓味
This tastes like shit strawberry.

125
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,030
-他说什么  -他说
- What'd he say? - He says,

126
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,210
"是草莓"
"It's strawberry."

127
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,340
什么
I'm sorry?

128
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,050
他的思乐冰
His... Slurpee.

129
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,800
他说这是草莓味的
He says it's strawberry.

130
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,090
那又怎样
So what?

131
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,290
霍普  他之前的确要了樱桃味的
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...

132
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,960
他们没有樱桃味的
Well, they didn't have cherry.

133
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,920
他们没有
They didn't have it.

134
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,630
而且这根本不重要
And it doesn't matter,

135
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,790
因为尝起来都一样  好吗
because it all tastes the same, okay?

136
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,590
都是糖水加冰  你给他说
It is sugar on ice. You tell him that.

137
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,400
给他说什么
Tell him what?

138
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,520
告诉他这尝起都他妈一样
You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same!

139
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,940
这都一样
It's all the same.

140
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,040
糖水加冰  没区别
Sugar on ice. No difference.

141
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,080
告诉那个傻子  一点都不一样
Tell that stupid man it is not the same in the slightest,

142
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,440
还有我要我说的樱桃味
and I would like the cherry I requested.

143
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,200
他表示明确不同意
He respectfully disagrees.

144
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,720
完全不一样
It's not the same at all,

145
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,810
而且他想
and he would like...

146
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,700
樱桃味
cherry.

147
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,550
是吗  你告诉他  别想了
Oh, yeah? You tell him... he can forget it.

148
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,970
他说别想了  没有樱桃味
He says forget it. No cherry.

149
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,270
没有樱桃  没有交易
No cherry, no deal.

150
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,060
他说
He says,

151
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,340
没有樱桃
"No cherry...

152
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,190
就没有交易
no deal."

153
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,030
妈的
Oh, shit!

154
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,600
别  霍普
No, Hop--

155
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,990
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

156
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,990
-我不会伤害他  -你在干什么
- I'm not gonna hurt him! - What are you doing?

157
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,620
别这样  别啊
Come on! Come on!

158
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,950
我就只是给他个机会
I'm just giving him an opportunity

159
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,780
让他喝到他自己该死的
to get his own damn...

160
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,000
樱桃思乐冰
cherry Slurpee!

161
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,060
吉姆  那个人是国家的敌人
Jim, that man is an enemy of the state.

162
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,860
他耍了我们一整天
Yeah, who's been jerking us around for a full day!

163
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,300
我给他买了他要的樱桃思乐冰  然后呢
I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what?

164
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,410
他会要一架直升机把他接到他的私人岛屿上
He wants a helicopter to charter him to his own private island.

165
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,320
我这辈子都在应付
I have dealt with assholes like this

166
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,430
这样的混蛋
my entire life.

167
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,950
昨天在树林里  他本可以跑掉的
Yesterday in the woods, he could've escaped,

168
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,040
但他没有
but he didn't.

169
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,540
他一直跟着我们
He stuck with us.

170
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,400
你觉得是为什么
Why do you think that is?

171
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,120
是因为
It's because...

172
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,420
他害怕
he's scared.

173
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,860
他害怕
He's scared.

174
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,250
不是因为我们
Not of us,

175
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,100
是因为他们
of them.

176
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,870
他怕那些能像我们一样能轻易杀了他的
He's scared of that seven-foot-tall Russian freak

177
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,910
七英尺高的苏联怪胎
who could've killed him just as easily as us.

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,530
司木露知道
Smirnoff knows

179
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,730
如果他毫无伤痕地回到战友身边
that if he runs back to his comrades without a scratch on him,

180
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,490
他们会觉得他泄密了
they're gonna think that he spilled his guts.

181
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,800
所以  无论他喜不喜欢
So, whether he likes it or not

182
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,920
我们都是他最好的机会
we are the best chance he's got.

183
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,530
我给他30秒来敲门
I give him 30 seconds before he comes knocking on that door,

184
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,940
回到我们怀里
right back into our arms,

185
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,530
带着新的谦逊
with a new sense of humility.

186
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,660
吉姆
Jim...

187
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,610
我觉得他在发动汽车
I, uh, believe he has started the car.

188
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,410
霍普
Hopper.

189
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,360
你懂得  测试我们  他只是在虚张声势
You know, testing us. He's just calling my bluff.

190
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,460
我觉得他正开车走
I believe he is now driving away.

191
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,700
吉姆  吉姆  让开
Jim. Jim, move.

192
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
-乔伊  乔伊  -让开  让开  让开
- Joyce, Joyce - Move, move, move!

193
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,240
不还意思  他刚说什么
I'm sorry, what did he say?

194
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,080
他说他也喜欢草莓味
He says he likes strawberry, too.

195
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,610
所以  当我们向枢纽开火时
So, when we set fire to the hub,

196
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,700
我们把魔狗引开好让一一关上大门
we drew the Demodogs away so El could close the gate.

197
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,310
不过现在  由于一些疯狂的原因
But now, for some insane reason,

198
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,360
苏联人似乎想重新打开它
the Russians appear to be trying to reopen it,

199
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,430
打开这个摧毁了我们冒着生命危险换来的一切
which just destroys everything we risked our lives for.

200
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,430
"我们"包括卢卡斯吗
By "We" You're including Lucas?

201
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,560
是的当然
Yes, of course.

202
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,770
所以  你说的这些是  卢卡斯都参与了
So, all that shit you told me, Lucas was there?

203
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,800
-对  -我哥哥  卢卡斯・查尔斯・辛克莱 
- Yeah. - My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair?

204
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,790
是的
Yes!

205
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,910
我不信
I don't believe you.

206
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,990
等等  所以关于一一和大门的事你都相信
Wait, so you believe everything about El and the gate

207
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,590
还有魔狗和吸灵魔
and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer,

208
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,510
却质疑你哥哥的参与度
but you question your brother's involvement?

209
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,750
正是
That's correct.

210
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,160
很有说服力
Makes total sense.

211
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,040
-你需要帮忙吗  -不
- Um, you need help with that? - No.

212
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,200
我是说  这得花点时间  所以
Well, I mean, it's taking a while,so

213
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,840
当然了  夏洛克
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

214
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,080
好吧  如果我们
All right, so if we don't

215
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,470
无法找到更有效的办法停下这些风扇
find a more efficient method to stop these fans,

216
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,760
我们就找不到支援
we're never gonna find help,

217
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,990
你的那些冰淇淋好哥们就都完了
and your ice cream buddies are screwed.

218
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,630
对  就那个态度  肯定完了  老天爷
Yeah, with that attitude, they are. Jee-zus!

219
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,180
我只是很现实
I'm just being realistic.

220
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,990
我是说  我们用了九小时才走了三百米
I mean, we've made it about point-three miles in nine hours.

221
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,220
我们还得花三小时走到隧道尽头
Then we had to walk three hours down that tunnel,

222
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,060
所以我估计回到电梯的十英里
so I'd estimate ten miles back to the elevator,

223
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,190
大概得花上我们十二天半
which should take us approximately twelve-and-a-half days.

224
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,700
你在脑子里算出来的吗
Did you just do all of that in your head?

225
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,180
我擅长算术
I'm good with numbers.

226
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,240
我靠  你是个书呆
Holy shit. You're a nerd.

227
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
再说一次
Come again?

228
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,150
你  是  书  呆
You... are... a... nerd.

229
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,960
你最好收回那句话  呆子
Okay, you better take that back, nerd.

230
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,370
真相不能被关回盒子里
Can't put the truth back in the box.

231
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,270
-但那根本就不是真相  -我们来检验一下
- But it's not the truth. - Let's examine the facts, shall we?

232
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,170
事实一  很明显  你是个数学奇才
Fact number one: you're a math whiz, apparently.

233
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,060
那只是个很简单的方程
That was a pretty straightforward equation.

234
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,320
事实二  你是个政治迷
Fact number two: you're a political junkie.

235
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,320
就因为我不同意共产主义是一种意识形态
Just because I don't agree with Communism as an ideology--

236
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,000
事实三  你很喜欢小马宝莉
Fact number three: you love My Little Pony.

237
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,680
小马宝莉和这个有什么关系
And what does My Little Pony have to do with this?

238
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,710
我们来回忆一下小马最近的探险  好吗
Ah, let's recall the ponies' latest adventure, shall we?

239
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,030
邪恶的半人马队和泰瑞克提雷克
The evil centaur team and Tirek

240
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,610
在午夜城堡把苹果嘉儿变成了一条龙
turns Applejack into a dragon at Midnight Castle,

241
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,990
梅根和其他小马不得不使用月地精的魔法
and then Megan and the other ponies have to use Moochick's magic

242
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,630
来击败他的黑暗彩虹
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,

243
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,610
让他们免于永生被奴役的命运
saving them from a lifetime of enslavement.

244
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,190
世界上所有的粉红色都掩盖不了这无可辩驳的事实
All the pink in the world can't disguise the irrefutable fact

245
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,960
马人  城堡  龙和魔法 
that centaurs and castles and dragons and magic

246
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,760
都是书呆子标配
are all standard nerd tropes.

247
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,170
因此  小马宝莉是个书呆动画
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.

248
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,760
因此  你  艾瑞卡
Ergo, you, Erica,

249
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
是个书呆
are a nerd.

250
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,930
你又是怎么知道这么多小马宝莉的
And how do you know so much about My Little Pony?

251
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,920
因为我
Because I'm...

252
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,310
是个书呆
a nerd.

253
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,450
我们走
Let's go...

254
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,890
书呆
nerd.

255
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,320
你
You...

256
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,770
那一下很痛
That one stung.

257
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,950
你为谁工作
Who do you work for?

258
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,560
说了一百万次了  在海员勺冰淇淋店工作
For the millionth time, I work at Scoops Ahoy!

259
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,320
海员勺冰淇淋店
Scoops Ahoy.

260
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,560
什么鬼东西
What the hell?!

261
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,110
看看我的衣服
Look at my outfit!

262
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,440
看看我的衣服
Look at my outfit!

263
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,800
你们以为我就是穿这个的吗
You think I just wear this?!

264
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,510
以为我是个穿水手服的间谍吗
Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform?

265
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,870
你怎么进来的
How did you get in?

266
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,560
我已经跟你说了
I already told you.

267
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,660
我之前告诉你了
I told you before.

268
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,260
我的快递没到
My delivery didn't come,

269
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,360
我跟朋友们以为
and my friends and I,

270
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,930
外卖被放在装卸区那里了
we thought that it was left at the loading dock,

271
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,620
所以我们就走进房间  然后房间变成了电梯
so we went in the room, and then it turned into an elevator,

272
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,240
然后...  然后我们不断下坠  然后
and then... and then we dropped and then,

273
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,800
然后我睁开眼睛
next thing we know, I open my eyes,

274
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,630
我们就在这个...
and we're in this...

275
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,690
美妙的地方了
wonderful facility.

276
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,130
但我向上帝发誓
But I swear to God,

277
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,360
没有人知道我们  没人看到我们
nobody knows about us, nobody saw us.

278
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,790
你就让我们走  好吗
You could just let us go, all right?

279
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,480
我不会把这件事告诉任何人  好吗
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this, okay?

280
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,870
人生总有不如意  生活还是要继续
Shit happens, life goes on.

281
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,220
还有  冰...  冰淇淋
And, uh... ice-- ice cream.

282
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,830
冰淇淋  好吗
Ice cream, okay?

283
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,070
你们知道冰淇淋是什么  人人都喜欢冰淇淋
You guys know what ice cream is. Everybody loves ice cream.

284
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,390
我不知道你们有没有苏式冰淇淋
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream

285
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,920
或者意式冰淇淋
or if that's considered gelato.

286
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,200
我有些分不清  但说真的  不管你们想要什么
I don't know what's what, but whatever you guys want, seriously.

287
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,340
你们一定要试试奶油糖果战舰
USS Butterscotch, I mean, you gotta try it.

288
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,970
我跟你讲  那简直是举世无双
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya!

289
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,250
我喜欢这小子
I like this guy!

290
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,650
"奶油糖果...  战舰"
"USS... Butterscotch."

291
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,440
你为谁做事
Who do you work for?

292
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
拜托  不  不  不  我是认真的...
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously--

293
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,630
放开我
Get your hands off me!

294
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,860
史蒂夫
Steve?

295
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,680
史蒂夫  史蒂夫
Steve? Steve?

296
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,280
史蒂夫
Steve?

297
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,630
你们把他怎么样了  你们做什么了
What did you do to him? What did you do?

298
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,740
把他们绑在椅子上
Put them in the chairs.

299
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,460
别碰我
Don't touch me!

300
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,370
史蒂夫
Steve--

301
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,740
史蒂夫  醒醒  史蒂夫
Steve, wake up. Steve?

302
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,780
你们做了什么
What did you do?!

303
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,750
别碰他
Don't touch him.

304
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,540
史蒂夫  史蒂夫  能听到我说话吗
Steve? Steve, can you hear me?

305
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,160
我觉得你朋友需要一个医生
I think your friend need a doctor.

306
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,310
好消息是...
Good thing...

307
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,400
我们有最棒的医生
we have the very best.

308
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,330
你会后悔的  小婊子
You are going to regret that, little bitch.

309
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,500
混蛋
Bastards.

310
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,130
放我们出去
Let us outta here!

311
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,740
混蛋  放我们出去  放我们出去
Bastards! Let us out! Let us out!

312
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:21,030
老年宾果之夜

313
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,800
她在里面这么久肯定不妙
It can't be good for her to be in there for this long.

314
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
迈克  你需要放轻松
Mike, you need to relax.

315
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,530
如果她脑损伤什么的怎么办
What if she gets brain damage or something?

316
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,340
该死  那是真的吗
Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?

317
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,890
不是  他瞎编的
No, it's not. He made it up.

318
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,220
迈克不懂自己在讲什么
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.

319
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,880
-那你懂咯  -不  我...
- Oh, and you do? - No, I...

320
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,740
没错  《霍金斯邮报》的
Yes, from The Hawkins Post.

321
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,050
我...  我几天前打电话问过...
I-- I called a couple days ago about the--

322
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,960
对  是的
Yes, yes, um...

323
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,000
我只是想...
I was just...

324
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,690
回来确认一下是不是有其它东西失踪了
following up to see if anything else had gone missing,

325
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,370
或者...  好吧
or if-- Okay.

326
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,180
抱歉打扰你了...
Um, sorry to bother--

327
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,520
-下一个打给谁  -没有下一个了
- Who's next? - There is no next.

328
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,150
除非你随便挑人家打电话
Unless you want to start calling random people's homes.

329
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,250
-这说不通  -这一切哪里说得通
- It doesn't make sense. - What part of any of this makes sense?

330
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,610
这是有模式的  它们的行为肯定有规律
There's a pattern, okay? A consistency to their behavior.

331
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,490
它们一开始就吃这种化学物质
They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started,

332
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,750
然后...怎样  它们突然就不吃了
and-- and, what, they just stop, out of the blue?

333
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,860
也许它们已经吃够了
Maybe they have all the chemicals they need.

334
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,010
也许它们已经都变成那些...怪物了
Maybe they've all turned into those... things.

335
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,580
但源头呢
But what about the source?

336
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,350
我是说   吸灵魔突然就不感染人类了
I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people?

337
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,350
即使失灵者现在都是怪物了  为什么一一找不到
And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them?

338
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,680
好吧  你们能帮我们评评理吗
Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us?

339
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,680
你们认为谁应该来决定一一的限度
Who do you think should decide El's limits?

340
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,200
迈克还是十一
Mike or Eleven?

341
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,130
你这样的描述简直是胡说
The way that you frame that is such bullshit.

342
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,740
这不是胡说  迈克  这就是你的问题所在
It's not bullshit, Mike. This is your whole problem.

343
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,360
这也正是她甩掉你的原因
And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass.

344
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,110
一一把你甩了
El dumped you?

345
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,490
是的  因为她一直针对我
Yeah, because she is conspiring against me.

346
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,250
她在腐化她
She's corrupting her.

347
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,730
不  是启发她
No, enlightening her.

348
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,610
事实是  她不属于你
The fact is, she's not yours.

349
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,050
她属于她自己  完全有能力自己做决定
She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions.

350
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,960
她无缘无故地用自己的生命冒险
She's risking her life for no reason.

351
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,820
无缘无故
For no reason?

352
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,890
迈克  失灵者们现在就在外面为所欲为
Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what.

353
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,040
-杀戮  吸灵...  -变身为怪物
- Killing, flaying... - Transforming into monsters.

354
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,500
而且一一也不是傻子
And El's not stupid.

355
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,630
她比我们更了解自己的能力
She knows her abilities better than any of us.

356
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,010
-正是  谢谢  -她是个独立的人
- Exactly, thank you. - And she is her own person.

357
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,610
-正是  -她会按自己的意愿做事
- Exactly. - With her own free will.

358
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,660
正是
Exactly.

359
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,620
一一已经两次拯救这世界了  而迈克还是不信任她
El has saved the world twice, and Mike still doesn't trust her.

360
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,610
你想来讨论信任吗  真的吗
You wanna talk about trust, really?

361
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,710
你还让十一来偷窥我们
After you made Eleven spy on us?

362
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,740
-等等  什么  -她没告诉你吗
- Wait, what? - Oh, she didn't tell you this?

363
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,710
-没有  -你女朋友用一一的能力来偷窥我们
- No. - Your girlfriend used El's powers to spy on us.

364
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,420
不  不  不  不是我让她做的
No, no, no, I did not make her.

365
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,600
是她的主意
It was her idea.

366
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,380
说真的  我们为什么要讨论这个
And why are we even talking about this, seriously?

367
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,730
是啊  谁在乎
Yeah, who cares?

368
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,650
-我在乎  -没错
- I care. - Yeah.

369
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,870
看来女朋友都不说谎  她们直接偷窥
I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.

370
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,940
我们只是在闹着玩
We were just joking around.

371
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,100
如果我正好在拉一大坨屎
Wouldn't it've been so funny

372
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,960
或者别的什么事会不会很好笑
if I was taking a massive shit or something?

373
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,770
-你没在拉  -但如果我有呢
- You weren't. - But what if I was?

374
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,280
-好恶心  -你是认真的吗  迈克
- Then gross! - Seriously, Mike?

375
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
我只是在说明麦克斯
I'm just trying to demonstrate

376
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,500
有多不小心对待十一的能力
how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

377
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,030
事实上  你们都很不小心
In fact, how careless all of you are.

378
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,650
你们就像对待一个机器
You're treating her like

379
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,570
那样对待她  可她不是机器
some kind of machine when she's not a machine,

380
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,160
而且我不想她因为寻找失灵者而死
and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed

381
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,200
因为失灵者们显然已经从地球上消失了
when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth.

382
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,900
所以能不能拜托大家想个新方案
So can we please just come up with a new plan

383
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,140
因为我爱她  我不能再失去她了
because I love her and I can't lose her again.

384
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,630
发生什么了
What's going on?

385
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,500
没事  没事
Nothing. Nothing.

386
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,130
集体讨论而已
Just a family discussion.

387
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,760
我找到他了
I found him.

388
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,260
找到谁了
Found who?

389
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,600
他说那叫钥匙  还说钥匙会释放巨大的能量
He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy.

390
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,770
它需要强大的力量  电力
It requires much strength, power.

391
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,430
而那些房屋  比如你们发现的那座
Those houses, like the one you found,

392
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,160
位于变压器附近
they're located near, uh, transformers.

393
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,170
正在从你们镇上的电网窃取电力
They're stealing from your town's power grid.

394
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,870
为什么要在这里建造钥匙
Why build this key here?

395
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,570
他们怎么不在自己后院造呢
Why are they not doing this in their own backyard?

396
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,530
他们想干什么  把我们炸成碎片吗
What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens?

397
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,020
这样的钥匙  曾经在苏联大量存在
There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia,

398
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,330
但最后都无法正常运作
but they turned out wrong.

399
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,870
他们就得去往  去往
They had to come to where the... where the, uh...

400
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,910
去哪里
Where the what?

401
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,400
-我没听懂他说什么  -我以为你俄语很流利呢
- I don't understand what he's saying. - I thought you were fluent.

402
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,480
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

403
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,340
你们不满意我的免费翻译服务是吗
Are my free translation services not good enough for you?

404
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,250
你们就是想狠狠控诉我
Because you can just go ahead and file your complaint

405
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,830
也是白搭
right up my ass!

406
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,960
司木露干什么呢
What is Smirnoff doing?

407
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,450
他是在告诉我
He's showing me.

408
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,550
他说吸管
Uh, he says the straw,

409
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,120
他们在用吸管打洞
they're using it to penetrate a hole

410
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,510
给盒子打洞
in... A box?

411
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,800
抱歉抱歉
Okay, sorry, sorry.

412
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,960
吸管代表的是钥匙  能够释放庞大的能量
The straw represents the key, which emits a great energy.

413
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,450
他们要利用这股能量
They're using this energy...

414
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,130
冲破阻碍
to break through a barrier,

415
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,150
来开启
to open...

416
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,630
一扇门
a doorway.

417
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,680
一扇联通不同世界的门
A doorway between worlds.

418
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,230
不过似乎钥匙还只是必要条件的一半
But it seems this key was only half the equation.

419
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,830
选址是条件的另一半
Location-- Location was the other half.

420
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,670
要做什么
Oh, what--

421
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,120
在霍金斯  这扇门曾被开启过一次
In Hawkins, this door had been opened once.

422
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,790
它现在还在
It was still...

423
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,770
复原中
healing.

424
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,020
天啊
Jesus Christ.

425
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,610
所以说  这扇门现在开了
So, this door is open now?

426
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,880
他说门
He says it is...

427
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,830
正在开
opening.

428
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,110
-你要干什么  -给孩子们打电话
- Where are you going? - To call our children.

429
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,600
我们能接着看《乐一通》了吗
Can we watch Looney Tunes now?

430
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,980
不行
Nyet.

431
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,440
-需要我帮你找点什么吗  -威士忌
- Can I help you with something? - Whiskey.

432
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,060
-你有威士忌没  -没  但伏特加倒是有
- You have whiskey? - No, but I do have vodka.

433
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,490
有办法开启这把钥匙
If there's a way to start this key,

434
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,300
就会有办法阻止启用它  对吧
there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?

435
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,900
关了它
Turn it off?

436
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,180
-没错  -对吧
- Right. - Right?

437
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,480
那钥匙  有办法关闭吗
The key, is there a way to turn it off?

438
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,450
他说  他当然能把它关掉
He says, "Of course he could turn it off.

439
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,270
爱迪生会关不掉电灯吗  贝尔会挂不断电话吗
Could... Edison not turn off a lamp, could Bell not hang up a phone?"

440
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,310
自以为是的混蛋  不过
Cocky bastard. "But..."

441
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,430
不过什么
But what?

442
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,990
不过他现在
But he is now...

443
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,720
"光着"
"Naked."

444
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,970
抱歉  是"暴露了"  有损声誉
Sorry, "Exposed." Compromised.

445
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,310
我带你到那去
Hey, I will get you there.

446
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,400
我会把你带到你的钥匙那
I will get you to your key.

447
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,900
你要不要问问他什么事这么好笑
You wanna ask him what the hell's so funny about that?

448
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,620
他说他欣赏你的勇气
He says he likes your courage.

449
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,200
你在他眼里是
You remind him of a...

450
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,070
兰博  电影《第一滴血》男主角

451
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,280
发福版的兰博
...fat Rambo.

452
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,870
但他说就算是身形健硕的兰博也没法去那里
But he says that even thin Rambo couldn't get there.

453
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,790
这把钥匙在一座地下堡垒里
This key, it is in an underground fortress

454
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,040
由苏联的顶尖智囊设计
designed by the greatest Russian minds,

455
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,060
有他们的精锐战士守卫
guarded by their greatest warriors.

456
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,550
想要擅闯
Breaking in is...

457
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,540
不可能
impossible.

458
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,410
撞大运了
Jackpot.

459
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,920
你到底会不会开车
Do you even know how to drive?

460
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,010
能有多难  麦克斯都能开
How hard can it be? Max did it.

461
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,030
-怎么会这样  -你真以为
- Aw, come on. - You seriously thought

462
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,990
-人家会留钥匙在这里  -肯定有把备用的
- they'd just leave keys in there?  - There's gotta be a spare.

463
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,190
-达斯汀  -怎么了
- Hey, Dustin? - Yeah?

464
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,090
你说魔王块头有多大来着
How big did you say that Demogorgon was?

465
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,270
超大  差不多两米七高  怎么了
Big. Nine feet or so. Why?

466
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,360
找到了
Found 'em.

467
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,490
艾瑞卡
Erica?

468
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,730
那是什么玩意
What the hell is that?!

469
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,170
致命武器
A deadly weapon.

470
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,510
可能会派上用场
Could be useful.

471
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,460
-什么用场  -你觉得呢
- For what? - What do you think?

472
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,810
放倒共党  解救你的朋友
Taking down Commies, saving your friends.

473
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,880
我还以为你很现实呢  书呆
Thought you were more realistic than that, nerd.

474
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,630
我们都不知道他们在哪
We don't even know where they are,

475
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,860
就算我们知道在哪  门口也该守了数不清的警卫
and even if we did, there are a million guards up there

476
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,100
手持比你那更致命的武器
with weapons way deadlier than that.

477
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,980
我们能为他们做的最好的事
The best thing we can do

478
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,750
就是从这离开  寻求帮助
for them is to get out of here and find help.

479
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,900
你悠着点
Easy with that.

480
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,800
这样我们和他们存活的几率才大大提高
Our chance of surviving, and theirs, rises substantially.

481
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,770
就信我这一次吧  拜托
Just trust me on this. Please?

482
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,200
救命
Help!

483
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,170
救命
Help!

484
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,800
-救命  -你能别喊了吗
- Help! - Hey, would you stop yelling?

485
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
史蒂夫  我的天啊
Steve! Oh, my God!

486
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,860
史蒂夫
Steve...

487
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,010
你还好吗
Are-- Are you okay?

488
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,040
我耳鸣了  呼吸也不顺畅
My ears are ringing, and I can't really breathe,

489
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,380
眼珠感觉就要从头骨弹出去了
my eye feels like it's about to pop out of my skull,

490
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,210
不过除了这些  都挺好的
but, you know, apart from that, I'm doing pretty good.

491
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,840
好消息是他们要给你叫医生来
Well, the good news is that they're calling you a doctor.

492
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,550
这里是办公地点吗
Is this his place of work?

493
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,980
氛围我很喜欢
I love the vibe.

494
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,240
十分宜人
Charming.

495
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,520
可不是嘛
Yeah, tell me about it.

496
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,510
看到你右边的桌子了吗
So, okay, do you see that table over there to your right?

497
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,540
不  另一边
No, your other right.

498
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,250
-看到了  -好
- Oh. - Yeah, okay.

499
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,200
-看到那把剪子了吗  -嗯
- And do you see those scissors? - Uh-huh.

500
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,250
好  试想如果我们
Yeah, well, I think that if we

501
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,390
同时挪动  我们就能凑到边上去
move at the same time, we could get over there,

502
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,170
我或许能
and then maybe I could

503
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,970
踢动桌子  把剪刀送到你大腿边
kick the table and knock them into your lap.

504
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,050
然后我就能把绳索剪开了
And I could cut the binds.

505
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,300
对  我们就能逃出这了
Yeah, and we could get out of here.

506
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,220
-明白了  好的  我们能做到  -对
- Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that. - Yeah.

507
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,200
那些蠢货  竟然把剪刀留在这里
Those morons. They left scissors in here?

508
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,240
-是啊  是够蠢的  -不折不扣的蠢货
- Yeah, morons. - Total morons.

509
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,130
-好了  -好了
- Okay. - Okay, so,

510
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,940
我数到三  我们一起跳
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.

511
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,360
-好的  数到三就跳  我知道了  -行
- Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha. - All right.

512
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,990
一  二  三
One, two, three.

513
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,040
-太好了  刚才那样管用  -好的
- Okay, that worked. - Okay.

514
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,610
-好  咱们再试试  -好
- All right. Uh, let's try again. - Right.

515
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,550
一  二  三
One, two, three.

516
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,950
-我们绝对可以  -越来越近了  准备
- Holy shit, this is gonna work! - We're close. Ready?

517
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,310
好  一  二  三
Okay, one, two, three.

518
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,060
没事  没事
It's okay, it's okay.

519
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,720
罗宾  不要哭
Don't cry. Robin.

520
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,890
你在笑吗
Are you laughing?

521
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,610
-对  -上帝啊
- Yeah. - Jesus!

522
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,160
抱歉
I'm sorry!

523
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,200
抱歉  只是
I'm so sorry. It's just...

524
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,080
我都不敢信
I can't believe...

525
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,280
我会和"秀发"史蒂夫・哈灵顿
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base

526
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,080
死在一个苏联秘密基地
with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

527
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,700
-这也太神奇了  -我们不会死的
- It's just too trippy, man. - We're not gonna die.

528
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,390
我们会出去的  明白吗
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

529
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,690
只要  你让我花点时间想想办法
Just-- You gotta let me just think for a second.

530
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,780
你记得滴答老师教的高二历史课吗
Do you remember, um, Mrs. Click's sophomore history class?

531
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,890
什么
What?

532
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,860
滴里搭拉女士
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity.

533
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,560
我们那些乐队怪咖这么叫她
That's what us band dweebs called her.

534
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,320
是周二还有周四的第一节课
It was first period, Tuesdays and Thursdays,

535
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,670
所以你总是迟到
so you were always late.

536
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,740
你还总是吃一样的早饭
And you always had the same breakfast.

537
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,690
芝麻贝果配培根  鸡蛋  奶酪
Bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel.

538
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,930
那一年每周有两天我就坐在你后面
I sat behind you two days a week for a year.

539
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,890
搞笑先生
Mister Funny.

540
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,730
炫酷先生
Mister Cool.

541
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,020
霍金斯高中之王本尊
The King of Hawkins High himself.

542
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,310
你是不是都不记得我在那节课上
Do you even remember me from that class?

543
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,460
你肯定不记得
Of course you don't.

544
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,290
你那时就是个混蛋  你知道吗
You were a real asshole, you know that?

545
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,500
是  我知道
Yeah, I know.

546
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,590
但是那不算什么
But it didn't even matter.

547
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,310
就算你是个混蛋也没什么
It didn't matter that you were an ass.

548
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,030
我那会还是
I was still...

549
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,770
迷恋你
obsessed with you.

550
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,830
就算我们这些废柴都假装不屑一顾
Even though all of us losers pretend to be above it all,

551
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,680
我们还是想受欢迎的
we still just wanna be popular...

552
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,550
想被人认可  普普通通的
accepted, normal.

553
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,190
如果这样能让你好受些的话
If it makes you feel any better,

554
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,270
有那些称号可不如想象中的那么好
having those things isn't all that great.

555
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,950
真的
Seriously.

556
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,050
让我很迷惑
It just baffles me.

557
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,510
人们告诉你很重要的事
Everything that people tell you is important,

558
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,450
人们告诉你应该关心的事  全都是
everything that people say you should care about, its all just...

559
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,130
胡扯
...bullshit.

560
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,680
不过我看你只有搞砸了之后才能想明白吧
But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right?

561
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,020
我希望是这样
I hope so.

562
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,310
我觉得我一辈子
I feel like my whole life has been...

563
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,240
就是个巨大的错误
one big error.

564
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,720
对
Yep.

565
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,700
至少不会比现在这样更糟糕了
At least it can't get any more messed up than this.

566
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,340
我希望我当时能在滴答女士的课上认识你
You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class.

567
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,510
-是吗  -真的
- Yeah? - Really, I do.

568
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,810
说不定你能帮我把那门课弄及格
Maybe you could've helped me pass the class.

569
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,460
说不定我就不会在这里
Maybe instead of being here,

570
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,540
而是正在去上大学的路上了
I'd be on my way to college right now.

571
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,990
我也不会知道
And I would have no idea

572
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,260
我们脚下藏着邪恶苏联人了
that there were evil Russians beneath our feet,

573
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,670
我会幸福地
and I would be happily

574
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,070
和另外某个蠢蛋一起卖冰淇淋
slinging ice cream with some other schmuck.

575
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,760
我得承认
Gotta say, though,

576
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,600
我喜欢当你的蠢蛋朋友
I liked being your schmuck.

577
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,100
至少曾经很开心
It was fun while it lasted.

578
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,180
是挺开心的
It was.

579
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,960
你们想去哪啊
Where were you two going?

580
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,380
这回试着说实话吧
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

581
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,140
这会让你和扎科夫博士的会面没那么痛苦
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov less painful.

582
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,960
等一下  等等
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

583
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,970
好  等等  那是什么
Okay! Wait, wait, wait! What is that thing?

584
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,750
这会帮你说实话
It will help you talk.

585
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,640
你是不是都没消过毒
Did you even clean that thing?!

586
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,770
他现在在干什么
What's he doing now?

587
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,020
那样不正常  对吧
And that's not normal, right?

588
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,210
比利在国庆节的时候待在他的屋里
Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July?

589
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,680
那绝对不正常
No, that's not normal.

590
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
他想让我们找到他
He wants us to find him.

591
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,350
对  我就是担心这点
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

592
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,010
如果我们去找比利
If we go to Billy,

593
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,740
那其余的失灵者就会知道我们在哪
then the rest of the flayed know where we are.

594
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,090
是个陷阱  我同意  我们会被埋伏
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

595
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,530
我们不会被偷袭
We won't be surprised.

596
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,060
我们知道他们会来
We'll know that they're coming,

597
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,280
我们会给那些失灵者颜色看看
and we will kick their flayed butts.

598
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,540
你是说一一会给他们颜色看看
You mean El will kick their butts.

599
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,740
幸运符  配有棉花糖碎的糖霜燕麦片

600
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,380
爸爸
Papa!

601
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,740
不
No.

602
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,660
彩虹  右转三下  左转四下
Rainbow. Three to the right, four to the left.

603
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,650
向日葵  彩虹
Sunflower. Rainbow.

604
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,940
-风险太大了  -对  而且没必要
- It's too risky. - Yeah, and unnecessary.

605
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,150
杀掉失灵者不会阻止吸灵魔
Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer.

606
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,840
我们必须找到是从哪里开始扩散的
We have to find out where it's spreading from.

607
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,610
我们要找到根源
We have to find the source.

608
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,810
比利知道
Billy knows it.

609
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,550
比利去过那
Billy's been there.

610
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,100
去过源头
To the source.

611
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,970
-对  但是  -那是陷阱  我明白
- Yeah, but-- - It's a trap. I know.

612
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,980
我们不能去找比利
We can't go to Billy,

613
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,960
不过我觉得还有一种办法
but I think there's another way.

614
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,440
我能看到他去过的地方
A way for me to see where he's been.

615
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,770
一一  你觉得你必须这么做  但其实不是的
El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't.

616
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,670
只是  你之前只这么做过一次
It's just, you've only done this before once.

617
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,520
而且你妈妈  她很爱你
And your mom, she loved you,

618
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,690
愿意让你知道发生了什么
and wanted you to know what happened.

619
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,340
比利的心思是扭曲  病态的
And Billy's mind is-- is sick, diseased.

620
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,930
吸灵魔在他体内
The Mind Flayer is in him.

621
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,930
他伤不了我的
He can't hurt me.

622
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,550
在那是不会的
Not in there.

623
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,780
我们并不清楚
We don't know that.

624
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,830
迈克
Mike.

625
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,770
我要你相信我
I need you to trust me.

626
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,450
好
Yeah.

627
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,290
小心点
Just... be careful.

628
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,680
比利
Billy.

629
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,660
你听得见吗
Can you hear me?

630
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,620
我想看看
I want to see.

631
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,200
我想看看发生什么了
I want to see what happened.

632
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,430
不对劲
Something's wrong.

633
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,640
住手  不  不  不
Stop! No! No! No!

634
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,770
不
No!

635
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,900
一一  你还好吗
El, are you okay?

636
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,160
你还好吗
Are you okay?

637
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,610
我没事
I'm okay.

638
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,460
发生什么了
What's going on?

639
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,180
我在海滩上
I'm... on a beach.

640
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,110
我可能有点笨
Okay, I may be dense,

641
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,770
但据我所知
but the last I checked,

642
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,940
霍金斯没有海滩
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.

643
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,160
你还看到了什么
What else do you see?

644
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,680
一个女人
A woman.

645
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,020
她很漂亮
She's... pretty.

646
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,920
我觉得她在看我
I... I think she's looking at me.

647
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,230
你做到了
You did it!

648
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,600
还有一个小男孩
There's... a boy.

649
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,930
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

650
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,430
嗯  我看到了
Yeah, I saw that!

651
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,940
至少有两米高
That was at least seven feet.

652
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,620
我不知道是怎么回事  但我吓坏了
I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack.

653
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,990
再玩十分钟好吗
Ten more minutes?

654
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,850
-好  再玩十分钟  -好
- Yeah, okay, ten more minutes. - Okay.

655
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,170
但超过十分钟  爸爸就要生气了  好吗
But any longer than that, Dad's gonna be mad, okay?

656
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,180
好
Okay!

657
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,480
比利
Billy?

658
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,620
小心激流
Watch out for rip currents!

659
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,810
我知道
I know.

660
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,840
那是比利
It's Billy.

661
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,960
在加利福尼亚
It's California.

662
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,910
那是一段回忆
It's a memory.

663
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,030
我觉得我看到了源头
I think I see it. The source.

664
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,240
就两分钟  吉姆
Two minutes, Jim.

665
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,300
这是一条安全线路
It's a secure line,

666
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,210
但超过两分钟  他们就会追踪到你
but any longer than that and they could trace you.

667
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,370
我想让他们来追踪我
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.

668
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,310
什么
What?

669
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,480
费城公共图书馆

670
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,720
费城公共图书馆
Philadelphia Public Library.

671
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,550
我是吉姆・霍普
This is Jim Hopper...

672
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,150
霍金斯的警察局长
uh... police chief, Hawkins.

673
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,120
是塞姆・欧文斯博士给我这个号码的
I got this number from Dr. Sam Owens.

674
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,990
你的身份码是什么
What is your identification code?

675
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,140
身份码
Identification code?

676
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,310
你不知道吗
You don't know it?

677
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,160
你在开玩笑吧
You must be joking.

678
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,140
不  不  我找到了  找到了
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.

679
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,410
我知道
I got it.

680
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,760
你居然把它写下来  放在钱包里
You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet?

681
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,960
古董战车  听着
"Antique Chariot." Listen.

682
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,700
告诉欧文斯  苏联人要打开入口了
Um, tell Owens that the Russkies are opening the gate.

683
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,630
他会明白的
Now, he'll know what that means.

684
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,600
我不是指苏联人 而是指入口
Not about the Russkies, but about the gate.

685
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,840
告诉他  星庭商场里有一个入口
Tell him that there's an entrance at Starcourt Mall.

686
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,190
我知道怎么进去
I know how to get in,

687
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,660
但我需要大量支援
but I need backup, a lot of backup.

688
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,760
让他给我回电6186258313
Have him call me back here at 618-625-8313.

689
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,500
你的信息将被传达
Your message will be relayed.

690
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,900
-现在怎么办  -我们就等着
- So, now what? - Now, we, uh... we wait.

691
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,390
你让我陷入危险了  吉姆
You compromised me, Jim.

692
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,080
你知道的  对吗  我得转移了
You do realize that, don't you? I'm gonna have to relocate.

693
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,920
-要等多久  -等他打来为止
- How long do we wait? - As long as it takes.

694
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,360
你怎么能这么冷静地坐着
How can you just sit there being calm?

695
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,970
我不冷静
I am not calm!

696
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,880
我们的孩子有危险
Our kids are in danger!

697
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,860
你说他们在参加节日庆典
You said they were at the festival!

698
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,330
那地方离入口就只有十分钟路程
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!

699
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,690
你要干什么  乔伊
What are you doing? Joyce?

700
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,500
你要干什么
What are you doing?

701
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,560
费城公共图书馆

702
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,970
费城公共图书馆
Philadelphia Public Library.

703
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,880
你好
Yes, hello.

704
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,890
我是古董战车的搭档
Uh, this is, uh, Antique Chariot's partner...

705
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,570
独轮车
Wheelbarrow.

706
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,530
古董战车没有
I don't think Antique Chariot

707
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,130
准确地传达情况的紧急
properly conveyed the urgency of our situation.

708
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,360
你在干什么
What are you doing?

709
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,430
我不能坐着干等电话
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.

710
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,760
-女士  你要保持冷静  -不
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm. - No.

711
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,490
别以高人一等的态度对待我
Don't you dare patronize me!

712
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,140
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are,

713
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,990
不管你是什么光荣秘书
if you're some glorified secretary or what,

714
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,070
你要是不想丢饭碗  就按我说的做
but if you don't wanna lose your job, here's what's gonna happen.

715
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,340
我挂电话后
When I hang up,

716
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,030
你马上起身
you're gonna get up off your ass,

717
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,950
去找欧文斯  告诉他发生了什么
and you're gonna go find Owens and tell him what's going on.

718
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,210
我们没时间讨论  他也一样
We don't have time to talk about it and neither does he.

719
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,670
他得来霍金斯
He's gotta get to Hawkins,

720
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,500
带上他的人马立刻过来
and he's gotta bring his men right now!

721
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,200
你听明白了吗
Do you understand me?

722
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,270
是的  明白了  女士
Yes, yes, ma'am.

723
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,570
谢谢  再见
Thank you. And good day.

724
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,180
刚好一分钟  乔伊
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.

725
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,110
一分钟太久了
That's one minute too long.

726
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,260
阿列克西
Alexei.

727
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,420
怎么了
What's going on?

728
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,190
我们得走了  快
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.

729
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,030
回去霍金斯  快
Back to Hawkins. Come on.

730
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,060
快走
Come on.

731
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,000
老实说  我没什么感觉
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.

732
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,280
你呢
Do you?

733
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,720
我感觉还好
I mean, I... I feel fine.

734
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,340
-我感觉正常  -我感觉还好

735
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,860
我感觉不错
I kinda feel good.

736
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,870
-想知道一个秘密吗  -什么
- Wanna know a secret? - What?

737
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,260
我也喜欢这种感觉
I like it, too!

738
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,500
-我感觉很好  -蠢货  他们打错药了吧
- I feel good. - Morons. They messed up the drug.

739
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,080
他们搞砸了
They messed it up!

740
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,130
-蠢货  蠢货  -蠢货
- Morons. Hey, morons! - Morons!

741
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,430
蠢货  蠢货
Moron! Mor--

742
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,020
我们肯定有不对劲
Oh, no. There's definitely something wrong with us.

743
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,090
不对劲
Something's wrong.

744
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,590
我现在能说我不喜欢医生吗
Would now be a good time to tell you that I don't like doctors?

745
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,130
我们再来一次  好吗
Let's try this again, yes?

746
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,420
你们为谁工作
Who do you work for?

747
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,990
勺子
Scoops.

748
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,910
海员勺
Scoops Ahoy.

749
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,370
你是怎么找到我们的
How did you find us?

750
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,660
完全是个意外
Totally by accident.

751
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,000
继续耍我们
More lies.

752
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,840
-那闪亮的小玩意是什么  -医生你要用它干什么
- What is that shiny little toy? - Where you going with that, doc?

753
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,460
等等  不要  等等  等等
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Wait! No! Wait! Wait!

754
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,920
密码  密码  我们听到一条密码
There was a code! There was a code! We heard a code!

755
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,310
密文
Code.

756
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,430
什么样的密文
What code?

757
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,660
"这周很长
"The week is long.

758
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,160
当蓝在西边遇到黄  银猫进食"
The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west."

759
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,330
什么  什么的
Blah, blah, blah.

760
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:13,460
你在镇上满世界地播报这该死的间谍消息
You broadcast that stupid spy shit all over town,

761
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,010
被我们的脑波增幅器截获了
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,

762
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,430
然后我们一天就把它破译了
and we cracked it in a day.

763
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,140
就一天
A day!

764
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,490
你自以为很聪明
You think you're so smart,

765
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,540
但几个冰淇淋店打工的孩子
but a couple of kids who scoop ice cream for a living

766
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,300
一天之内就破译了你的密文
cracked your code in a day,

767
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,970
现在大家都知道你在这里
and now, people know you're here.

768
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,000
还有谁知道我们在这里  小混蛋
Who knows we are here, little bitch?

769
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,430
达斯汀也知道
Uh, well, Dustin knows.

770
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:33,590
史蒂夫
Hey, Steve?

771

达斯汀・亨德森
Dustin Henderson.

773
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,060
是你那个卷毛小朋友吗
It is your small, curly-haired friend?

774
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,390
卷发  漂亮的卷发  小个子  有点像女孩
Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small. Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah.

775
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,320
他在哪里
Where is he?

776
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,810
他早就跑了  你这个大混蛋
He's long gone, you big asshole.

777
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,810
他可能已经在给霍普打电话了
And he's probably calling Hopper,

778
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,330
霍普再打给美国装甲部队
and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.

779
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,230
他们会来这里突击你们  火力全开
They're gonna come in here, commando-style, guns a-blazin',

780
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,950
把你们这帮可怜虫打回俄罗斯老家
and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.

781
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,080
你会被打成两半
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.

782
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,440
是这样吗
Is that so?

783
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,450
当然了
Yeah.

784
