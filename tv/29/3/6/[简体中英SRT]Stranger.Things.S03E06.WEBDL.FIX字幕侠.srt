255
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,390
‎第二 你是政治狂
Fact number two: you're a political junkie.

268
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,170
‎所以"小马宝莉"是怪胎
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.

269
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,710
‎所以你 艾丽卡

迈克不知道他自己在说什么

‎我就是...跟踪调查一下
I was just... following

346
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,300
有没有丢什么东西
up to see if anything else had gone missing,

347
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,100

349
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,310
‎-接下来是哪个  -没了
- Who's next? - There is no next.

350 
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,690
‎除非你想随便打打
Unless you want to start calling random people's homes.

351
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,110
‎-不应该  -这件事里哪部分是应该的
-It doesn't make sense. -What part of any of this makes sense?

352
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,400
有规律的 他们做事都有规律的
There's a pattern, okay? A consistency to their behavior.

353
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,780
‎一开始的时候 他们吃这些化学物
They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started,

354
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,660
然后...‎他们突然就不吃了吗
and...and, what, they just stop, out of the blue?

355
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,870
‎也许他们该有的化学物都有了
Maybe they have all the chemicals they need.

356
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,040
‎也许他们都变成那种东西了
Maybe they've all turned into those... things.

357
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,620
‎源头在哪
But what about the source?

358
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,380
‎夺心魔突然就不附在人身上了吗
I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people?

359
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,550
‎就算被夺心的人现在是怪物 ‎为什么小伊找不到他们
And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them?

360
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,630
‎你们能当下裁判吗
Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us?

361
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,630
‎谁应该决定小伊的极限
Who do you think should decide El's limits?

362
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,050
迈克还是伊莱雯自己
Mike or Eleven?

363
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
‎你怎么这么问 太心机了吧
The way that you frame that is such bullshit.

364
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,810
‎不是心机 迈克 ‎问题就出在这
It's not bullshit, Mike. This is your whole problem.

365
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,270
所以她才会把你甩了
And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass.

366
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,350
‎你被小伊甩了吗
El dumped you?

367
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,560
‎对 因为麦克斯想着怎么整我
Yeah, because she is conspiring against me.

368
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,520
她把小伊带坏了
She's corrupting her.

369
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,770
没有 是开导她
No, enlightening her.

370
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,400
‎事实是 她不是你的私有物
The fact is, she's not yours.

371
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,990
‎她是独立的人 能自己做决定
She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions.

372
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,860
‎她心甘情愿冒生命危险
She's risking her life for no reason.

373
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,780
心甘情愿
For no reason?

374
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,240
迈克 天知道被夺了心的人在做什么
Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what.

375
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,080
‎-杀人 夺心…  -变形成怪物
-Killing, flaying... -Transforming into monsters.

376
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,500
‎小伊不是笨蛋
And El's not stupid.

377
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,710
‎她比我们更了解自己的能力
She knows her abilities better than any of us.

378
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,170
‎-没错 谢谢  -她是独立的人
-Exactly, thank you. -And she is her own person.

379
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,590
‎-没错  -有自己的自由意志
-Exactly. -With her own free will.

380
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,800
‎没错
Exactly.

381
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,840
‎小伊拯救世界两次 迈克还不信任她
El has saved the world twice, and Mike still doesn't trust her.

382
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,230
‎你还好意思说信任吗
You wanna talk about trust,

383
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,180
你让伊莱雯监视我们
really? After you made Eleven spy on us?

384
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,550
‎-等等 什么  -她没告诉你吗
-Wait, what? -Oh, she didn't tell you this?

385
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,970
‎-没有  -你女朋友利用小伊的能力
-No. -Your girlfriend used El's powers

386
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,430
‎-监视我们  -不是 我没有逼她
-to spy on us. -No, no, no, I did not make her.

387
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,640
她自己想知道
It was her idea.

388
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,690
‎我们为什么要讨论这件事
And why are we even talking about this, seriously?

389
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,900
‎谁在乎
Yeah, who cares?

390
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,810
‎-我在乎  -对
-I care. -Yeah.

391
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,210
‎女朋友不说谎 
I guess girlfriends don't lie,
 
392
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,820
-她们爱监视  -我们闹着玩的
-they spy.  -We were just joking around.

393
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,000
如果我在拉大屎
Wouldn't it've been so funny

394
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,740
或者干其他的 那不是很搞笑吗
if I was taking a massive shit or something?

395
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,030
‎-你没有啊  -如果呢
-You weren't. -But what if I was?

396
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,700
‎-那就太恶心了  -说真的 迈克
-Then gross! -Seriously, Mike?

397
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,960
‎我只是想说
I'm just trying to demonstrate

398
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,580
麦克思滥用伊莱雯的能力
how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

399
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,950
‎其实 你们都一样
In fact, how careless all of you are.

400
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,890
‎你们把她
You're treating her like

401
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,540
当机器使 可她不是
some kind of machine when she's not a machine,

402
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,330
‎我不想她牺牲自己 去找被夺心的人
and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed

403
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,250
‎他们肯定都从地球上消失了
when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth.

404
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,960
‎所以我们能换个计划吗
So can we please just come up with a new plan

405
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,960
因为我爱她 ‎我不能再失去她了
because I love her and I can't lose her again.

406
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,760
‎怎么了
What's going on?

407
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,470
‎没事
Nothing. Nothing.

408
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,850
‎只是家庭讨论
Just a family discussion.

409
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,140
好吧
Oh.

410
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,650
‎我找到他了
I found him.

411
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,400
‎找到谁了

‎他说那个是钥匙 ‎钥匙能产生强大的能量
He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy.

413
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,660
‎需要很多能量 电
It requires much strength, power.

414
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,420
你们发现的那些房子
Those houses, like the one you found,

415
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,130
‎附近都有变压器
they're located near, uh, transformers.

416

‎他们偷你们镇上的电

‎为什么在这做这个钥匙
Why build this key here?

418
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,470
‎不在苏联做
Why are they not doing this in their own backyard?

419
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,510
想把我们炸成碎片吗
What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens?

420
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,980
‎以前 在苏联 有很多这种钥匙
There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia,

421
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,150
‎可或多或少都有问题
but they turned out wrong.

422

‎他们只好来… 来... 
They had to come to where the... where the, uh...

‎-我不知道他说的什么  -还以为你讲得很流利
-I don't understand what he's saying. -I thought you were fluent.

425
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,500
‎抱歉

苏联佬在干吗
What is Smirnoff doing?

430

他说这个吸管
Uh, he says the straw,

433

这么跟你说
If it makes you feel any better,

582
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,420
其实没什么好的
having those things isn't all that great.

583
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,000
‎说真的
Seriously.

584
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,010
‎只会让我迷茫
It just baffles me.

585
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,430
大家跟你说的那些重要的事
Everything that people tell you is important,

586
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,580
那些
everything that people

587
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,680
‎你应该关心的事 都只是...
say you should care about, it's all just...

588
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
...胡扯的
...bullshit.

589
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,690
经验是从经历里学来的 不是吗
But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right?

590
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,900
‎希望吧
I hope so.

591
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,320
‎我觉得我从小到大好像…
I feel like my whole life has been...

592
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,860
错得很离谱
one big error.

593
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,200
说得对
Yep.

594
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,780
起码不会比现在惨
At least it can't get any more messed up than this.

595
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,330
‎真希望在克里克的课上就认识你
You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class.

596
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,290
‎-是吗  -真的
-Yeah? -Really, I do.

597
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,460
可能有了你 我那门课就不会挂
Maybe you could've helped me pass the class.

598
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,580
‎我就不会在这
Maybe instead of being here,

599
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,380
现在应该准备去上大学了
I'd be on my way to college right now.

600
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,010
‎那我就不会知道
And I would have no idea

601
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,470
‎我们下面住满了邪恶的苏联人
that there were evil Russians beneath our feet,

602
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,920
‎我会开开心心
and I would be happily

603

跟另一个笨蛋 ‎一起舀冰淇淋
slinging ice cream with some other schmuck.

604
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,600
‎老实说
Gotta say, though,

605
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,350
我喜欢当你的笨蛋
I liked being your schmuck.

606
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,980
‎很开心
It was fun while it lasted.

607
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,060
‎是啊
It was.

609
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,740
‎你们两个准备去哪
Where were you two going?

610
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,340
‎这次说实话吧
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

611
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,590
‎这样柴可夫医生看完病 你们就不会那么痛苦了
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov less painful.

612
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,770
‎等等 等等 等等
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

613
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,940
‎等等 那是什么
Okay! Wait, wait, wait! What is that thing?

614
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,560
‎帮你说实话
It will help you talk.

615
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,360
‎那玩意儿消毒了吗
Did you even clean that thing?!

616
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,840
‎他现在在干吗
What's he doing now?

617
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,770
‎那是不是不正常
And that's not normal, right?

618
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,190
比利独立日的时候不出门吗
Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July?

619
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,610
‎那不正常
No, that's not normal.

620
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,650
‎他想让我们找到他
He wants us to find him.

621
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,150
‎对 我怕的就是这
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

622
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,780
‎如果我们去找比利 ‎其他被夺心的人就知道我们在哪了
If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are.

623
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,990
‎我也觉得这是陷阱 我们就中计了
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

624
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,200
‎这一点都不意外
We won't be surprised.

625
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,320
‎我们知道他们会来
We'll know that they're coming,

626
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,290
我们好好教训他们一顿
and we will kick their flayed butts.

627
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,130
‎小伊好好教训他们一顿
You mean El will kick their butts.

628

632
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,610
‎-太冒险了  -对 也没必要
- It's too risky. - Yeah, and unnecessary.

633
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,860
把被夺心的人杀掉 也阻止不了夺心魔
Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer.

634
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,820
‎我们要找到他们是从哪蔓延的
We have to find out where it's spreading from.

635
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,860
‎我们要找到源头
We have to find the source.

636
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,030
‎比利知道
Billy knows it.

637
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,570
‎比利去过那
Billy's been there.

638

‎去过源头
To the source.

639
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,450
‎-对 可…  -我知道是陷阱
-Yeah, but... -It's a trap. I know.

640
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,000
‎我们不能去找比利
We can't go to Billy,

641
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,080
还有个方法
but I think there's another way.

642
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,250
我看看他去过哪
A way for me to see where he's been.

643
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,560
‎小伊 我知道你觉得自己一定得这么做 不过别勉强自己
El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't.

644
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,730
‎你之前做过一次
It's just, you've only done this before once.

645
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,350
‎还有你妈 她爱你
And your mom, she loved you,

646
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,610
‎想让你知道发生了什么
and wanted you to know what happened.

647
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,230
‎比利的心... 坏掉了 生病了
And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased.

648
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,280
‎夺心魔控制了他
The Mind Flayer is in him.

649
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,990
‎他伤害不了我
He can't hurt me.

650
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,570
‎那个世界里不会
Not in there.

651
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,700
‎谁也说不准
We don't know that.

‎能听见我说话吗
Can you hear me?

658
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,710
‎我想看看
I want to see.

659
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,210
‎想知道发生了什么
I want to see what happened.

660
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,050
‎出事了
Something's wrong.

‎我... 在海滩上
I'm... on a beach.

668
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
‎好 我虽然有点傻
Okay, I may be dense,

669
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,530

‎我不知道那是什么 ‎不过我差点吓出心脏病了
I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack.
