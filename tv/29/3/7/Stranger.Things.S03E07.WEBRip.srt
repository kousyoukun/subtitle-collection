Now, doesn't that just lift your spirits?

Let's give another big hand
for the Hawkins High Marching Band!

11
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,078
I hope you're all having
a good time tonight.

12
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,246
Are you having a good time?

13
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,500
I can't hear you!

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,126
Are you having a good time?

15
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,256
I want you to know
that we spared no expense

16
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,344
to provide you with the very best
entertainment that money can buy!

17
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,887
Keep your arms inside.

18
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,223
Uh-oh! Dad can't get out now.

19
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,975
Why do you two enjoy torturing me?

20
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,395
- Because it's fun.
- Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's fun!

21
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,191
Oh, here we go.

22
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,609
Oh, boy.

23
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,152
Hoo!

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,946
But enough of me blabbering.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,490
Who here wants to see some fireworks?

26
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,285
Come on, now, you can do better than that.

27
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,539
Who here wants to see some fireworks?

28
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,215
Uh, why are we stopping?

29
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,717
Because I slipped Jimmy a five.

30
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,802
You what?

31
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,012
Come on,
these are the best seats in the house.

32
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,557
The best seats in the house.

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,641
Oh!

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,315
Happy Fourth of July!

35
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,663
Whoa!

36
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,624
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,709
Yeah.

38
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,889
Mom, the trees.

39
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,391
- What, baby?
- The trees are moving.

40
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,394
Why are you looking at the trees, baby?

41
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,813
The fireworks. Look at the fireworks!

42
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,116
That was a big one,
wasn't it?

43
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,128
He said he was
building something.

44
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,922
That it was all for me.

45
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,842
Building something...

46
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,136
- Is he talking about the flayed?
- He must be.

47
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,430
So, he's building an army,
just like we thought.

48
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,682
Yeah, but he's not building this army
to spread.

49
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,100
He's building it to stop Eleven.

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,477
Last year, El closed the gate on him.

51
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,271
I have a feeling
that really pissed him off.

52
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,314
Like, royally.

53
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,567
And the Mind Flayer now knows that
she's the only thing that can stop him.

54
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,485
- But if she's out of the way...
- Game over.

55
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,070
He also said

56
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,906
he was gonna kill all of you.

57
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,744
Yeah, well, that's nice.

58
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,006
Do you guys hear that?

59
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,554
It's just the fireworks.

60
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,182
Billy...

61
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,102
When he told you this,
it was here, in this room?

62
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,826
He knows we're here.

63
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,143
Jesus, slow down!

64
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,604
Yeah, what is this,
like, the Indy 500?

65
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,939
It's the Indy 300.

66
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,858
- No, dingus, it's 500!
- It's 300!

67
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,276
Let's say a million.

68
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,989
- What is wrong with them?
- I don't know.

69
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,242
- Dustin, watch out!
- Shit!

70
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,286
Oh!

71
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,538
You guys all right back there?

72
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,791
They're fine.

73
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,629
Come on. We gotta go, now.

74
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,464
- Come on! Get out!
- Let's go!

75
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,841
Ow!

76
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,592
- We're coming!
- Here goes nothin'.

77
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,219
This sucks.

78
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,435
- Hey! You look like you're surfing!
- Surfing! Yeah!

79
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,519
Whoa!

80
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,230
- They seem drunk.
- Why would they be drunk?

81
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,023
I'm a natural! Check it out!

82
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,066
Whoop!

83
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,277
Wipeout!

84
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,867
- He's burning up.
- You're burning up.

85
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,244
- One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve.
- God, no.

86
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,954
Ow!

87
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,956
His pupils are super dilated.

88
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,291
Maybe he's drugged.

89
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,542
Ugh. Boop!

90
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,377
Steve, are you drugged?

91
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,753
How many times, Dad?

92
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,174
I don't <i>do </i>drugs. It's only marijuana.

93
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,593
This isn't funny, okay?
I need to know what they did to you.

94
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,470
- Are you gonna die on us?
- Boop.

95
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,055
We all die,
my strange little child friend.

96
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,183
It's just a matter of how...

97
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,601
and when.

98
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,812
They're gonna be looking for us up there,

99
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,647
so I need you to tell me
where you parked your car.

100
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,192
Oh, can we make a pit stop
at the food court?

101
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,028
- I would kill for a hot dog on a stick.
- Ooh!

102
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,112
All right. Yeah, food.

103
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,364
Yes, you can have
as much food as you want,

104
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,450
but only if you tell me
where your car is parked.

105
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,868
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

106
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,077
The car's off the board.

107
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,662
- What?
- They took the keys.

108
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,414
The Russians, they took the keys.

109
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,707
Like, forever ago.

110
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,168
That's a bummer, right?

111
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,132
Oh!

112
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,968
Oh, my God, that tastes so good. Ah!

113
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,553
Steve, can you taste the air?

114
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,388
I taste it! I taste it!

115
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,642
- Stop!
- Shit! Come on! Come on!

116
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,434
Stop right there!

117
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,188
- Okay, okay, okay! Woo!
- Why are we running?

118
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,203
Yeah. That's good like that.

119
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,591
Hey, get away from the windows.

120
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,366
It's close.

121
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,467
Where'd it go?

122
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,486
Holy shit.

123
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,928
El!

124
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,140
El!

125
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,690
Pull!

126
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,442
Nancy, shoot it!

127
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,618
Come on! Lucas!

128
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,802
Pull!

129
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,349
El! El, you okay?

130
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,512
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on, go!

131
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,264
- Go!
- Hurry up! Come on!

132
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,348
Everybody out!

133
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,309
- Go!
- Go, come on!

134
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,603
Go, go, go, go!

135
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,899
- Come on!
- Come on!

136
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,443
Come on! Come on!

137
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,238
Get in. Right here.

138
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,201
Drive! Drive!

139
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,461
- Whoa!
- Where are we going?

140
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,046
Just trust me.

141
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,342
All clear.

142
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
<i>Doc!</i>

<i>Eighty-eight miles per hour!</i>

145
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,941
Come on.

146

<i>The temporal displacement occurred</i>

- No, no, no! These seats are too close!

148
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,867
- Dude, these seats blow.
- Then don't watch the movie.

149
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,494
- We wanna watch it.
- Then watch it!

150
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,829
- Shh!
- Shh!

151
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,746
Sorry.

152
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,122
Whatever you do,

153
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,416
don't... go... anywhere.

154
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,669
Fine, Dad.

155

<i>The appropriate question is</i>

I'm never having kids.

Cooling off.

163
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,229
Like Oswald.

164
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,481
Oswald was found in a theater
and shot to death.

00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,524
A week later.

166
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,442
The point is, his plan didn't work.

167
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,861
Only because it was a setup.

168
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,362
- What?
- He was just a patsy.

169
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,197
- Tell me you're joking.
- Shh!

170
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,157
Shh!

171
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,659
We need to get outta here.

172
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,412
All right, you watch
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

173
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,081
- Make sure they don't go anywhere.
- Where are you going?

174
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,624
To find us a ride.

175
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,792
<i>Look out!</i>

176
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,297
Doc...

177
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,549
- What's happening?
- I have no idea.

178
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,885
<i>Are you telling me that</i>
<i>you built a time machine...</i>

179
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,354
- What's he saying?
- He's showing me the location of the key

180
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,856
to turn off the machine.

181
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,610
Sorry, "keys." Two keys.

182
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,611
Two-man rule.

183
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,405
- Two-man rule?
- Yeah, two men, two keys, like a...

184
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,990
nuclear launch.

185
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,284
But, uh, to retrieve the keys,
there is a vault.

186
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,119
And to open the vault,

187
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,455
you need to enter Planck's constant.

188
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,415
- Planck's what?
- Planck's constant.

189
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,168
- It's a very famous number.
- All right, so we get the keys,

190
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,086
and then we turn the machine off.

191
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,379
That's what he says.

192
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,215
All right, well, that shouldn't be
too hard. We can do this.

193
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,426
Joyce, did you hear the part
where he said the place was like

194
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,594
an impenetrable fortress?

195
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,512
Yeah, but there has to be a way in.

196
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,931
Yeah, there is. Our military.

197
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,016
- Who are coming.
- Well, we don't know that anymore

198
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,727
because you yelled at them
like it was a parent-teacher conference,

199
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,647
and then you hung up on them,
so we don't know what the hell's going on,

200
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,566
because now we're...
Wait, wait, what are we do... Oh!

201
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,026
Wait, that's right!

202
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,613
We're on our way to rescue our children

203
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,699
from the big, bad
Fourth of July celebration!

204
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,286
You know what, if you can't handle this,
then just turn around

205
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,537
and drop me off first.

206
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,039
What are you gonna do?

207
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,249
You gonna walk back to Hawkins?

208
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,835
I will do anything
if it gets me away from you!

209
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,089
Children! Children! Children!

210
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,759
This interminable bickering
was amusing at first,

211
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,305
but it's getting very stale and we've
still got a long drive ahead of us.

212
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,141
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit

213
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,979
and get to the part where you admit
your sexual feelings for one another?

214
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,523
- Whoa!
- You are way off base, buddy!

215
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,068
Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me!

216
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,529
Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know.

217
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,572
Probably reminds you
of a bad relationship,

218
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,159
and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man
to settle down with,

219
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,372
but, admit it, you're real curious to know
what he's like in the sack.

220
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,541
And you. Ha!

221
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,793
Well, you're just a big manbaby

222
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,295
who'd rather act tough
than show his true feelings,

223
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,466
because the last time
you opened your heart, you got hurt.

224
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,384
Owie.

225
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,722
And now, rather than admit these feelings,
you're dancing around one another

226
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,891
with this mind-numbing
and frankly boorish mating ritual.

227
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,811
So, please, for my sake,

228
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,188
either quit your bickering, or pull over,

229
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,982
tear off those clothes,

230
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,108
and get it over with already!

231
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,867
What was that?

232
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,618
I told them they should have sex.

233
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,580
They have not had sex?

234
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,874
No.

235
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,102
Oh! Oh!

236
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,375
Okay, get her down.

237
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,962
Okay.

238
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,297
Lemme see.

239
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,510
Oh, shit.

240
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,346
What... What... Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,806
I'm cleaning the wound.

242
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,724
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding,

243
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,227
then clean, then disinfect, then bandage.

244
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,688
I skateboard. Trust me.

245
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,774
Mike, hold this.

246
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,237
Keep the pressure on it,
nice and firm, okay?

247
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,696
We're gonna need water, soap.

248
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,365
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

249
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,622
Does any of this help?

250
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,790
No.

251
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,291
Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.

252
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,377
- A bowl?
- Lucas.

253
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,420
- Go.
- Okay.

254
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,050
What did that thing
look like to you?

255
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,177
Like that thing in the hospital,
only bigger.

256
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,428
Yeah, a lot bigger.

257
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,848
Like, Tom and Bruce,
they merged to become one, right?

258
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,433
And... And Driscoll kept saying
how she needed to go back to the source...

259
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,519
Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?

260
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,020
Maybe.

261
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,566
And... And... And maybe Heather and Janet,
too, and God knows who else.

262
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,111
I don't know how we're gonna
kill this thing, but if we do...

263
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,030
- We kill all the flayed.
- And... we end this.

264
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,491
Maybe.

265
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,952
All I know is...

266
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,912
we need El.

267
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,414
Bowl...

268
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,082
Bowl...

269
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
Bowl...

270
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,004
- Why wouldn't it be with the cereal?
- I don't know.

271
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,756
What else do you use a bowl for?

272
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,049
I... I don't know.

273
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,344
Oh, shit.

274
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,894
Satan's Baby.

275
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,521
You ever shot one of these suckers?

276
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,231
No. Is it sweet?

277
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,193
- That's an understatement.
- That doesn't look like a bowl.

278
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,320
Nah, it's way better.

279
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,323
There is a reason this warning label
says "18 or older."

280
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:04,203
This sucker is filled with 150 grains
of black powder.

281
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,121
AKA gunpowder.

282
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,125
Strap two of these together,
and it's bigger than an M-80.

283
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,460
Five of them,

284
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,671
we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.

285
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,174
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?

286
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,634
Do you have a better idea?

287
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,219
Uh, yeah. Eleven.

288
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,348
Against that thing?
She's gonna need some backup.

289
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,100
Oh, my God.

290
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,185
Hold this.

291
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,815
Does that hurt?

292
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,776
Uh, not bad.

293
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,987
You're gonna have an awesome scar.

294
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,156
You'll look even more badass.

295
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,115
Bitchin'.

296
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,450
Yeah, bitchin'.

297
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,080
El...

298
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,915
Yeah?

299
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,917
I've been meaning to tell you something.

300
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,003
It's just, being broken up,

301
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,255
it's been hard.

302
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,509
And...

303
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,011
I like that you and Max are friends now.

304
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,307
It's just, I was jealous at first,
and... and angry.

305
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,476
And that's why I said
all that stupid stuff.

306
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,645
And it's like I wanted you all to myself.

307
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,648
And now I realize how unfair that is.

308
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,442
And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry.

309
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,447
I just, like, I've never felt like this,
you know, with anyone before...

310
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,199
and...

311
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,537
You know, they do say
it makes you crazy.

312
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,039
What makes you crazy?

313
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,418
You never... You never heard that term...

314
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,503
You know, like the phrase, like...

315
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,672
"blank makes you crazy," like the word...

316
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,009
- "Girlfriends"?
- No, no, no, no, not... not girlfriends.

317
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,386
- "Boyfriends."
- No! No, no, not boyfriends either.

318
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,805
- It's like... It's like a feeling or...
- A feeling...

319
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,100
Yeah, like something... Like, old people
say it to each other sometimes.

320
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,184
- Old people?
- Yeah.

321
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,021
What I wanna say is...

322
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,605
that I just...

323
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,232
I know that I...

324
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,612
<i>I repeat... this is a code red!</i>

325
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,448
Dustin?

326
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,615
Mike?

327
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,409
- <i>Dustin!</i>
- Mike!

328
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,995
<i>Oh, my God, you have to listen.</i>
<i>I know I've been MIA,</i>

329
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,165
and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad.
I mean, I actually was mad,

330
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,667
but it's also because
I was trapped underground

331
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,918
in a secret Russian base.

332
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,506
Dustin, you're going way too fast.
I can't understand you.

333
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,760
I know that sounds insane,
but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins!

334
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,053
The goddamn Russians!

335
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,305
<i>And now... they're using...</i>
<i>to open the gate.</i>

336
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,848
Dustin, you're... you're breaking up.

337
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,267
And now they're after us
and we don't have a way out of here,

338
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,311
so I need you to come and get us.
Can Nancy drive?

339
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,606
Dustin, you're cutting out.

340
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,941
- Mike?
<i>- Dustin, you there?</i>

341
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,443
Mike? Mike, do you copy?

342
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,652
<i>Dustin...</i>

343
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,823
Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike!

344
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,492
- Dustin!
- Mike!

345
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,369
What is it?

346
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,500
Do you have any batteries? Double-A?

347
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,876
Why would I have batteries?

348
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,127
I always carry batteries.

349
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,462
Then what's the problem?

350
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,630
I need eight.

351
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,631
Eight?

352
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,634
Shit. Guess we'll have to go to plan B.

353
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,552
Plan B? What's plan B?

354
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,104
Where... are they?

355
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,484
That's amazing.

356
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:28,407
So, like, I wasn't totally focused
in there or anything, but...

357
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,492
I'm pretty sure...

358
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,246
that mom was trying to bang her son.

359
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,873
Wait, wait, the hot chick
was Alex P. Keaton's mom?

360
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,041
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

361
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,668
But they're the same age.

362
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,753
No, but he went back in time.

363
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,965
Then why is it called <i>Back to the Future?</i>

364
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,676
He has to go <i>back </i>to the future

365
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,678
because he's in the past.

366
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,972
So, the future is actually the present,

367
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,348
which is his time.

368
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,103
Wh... What?

369
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,981
No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough.

370
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,452
Wow.

371
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,756
Hey, Robin.

372
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,551
You gotta check this out.

373
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,429
Check this...

374
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,931
This... The ceiling, it's beautiful.

375
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,851
Oh, wow.

376
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,645
Oh.

377
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,355
Stay here,
go over the plans with Smirnoff.

378
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,941
- I can help look.
- No, you'll scare the children.

379
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,610
- Jim, if this is about earlier...
- Stay put, Freud!

380
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,695
You hear me? Stay put!

381
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,078
You know,
say what you will about Kline,

382
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,413
he certainly knows how to throw a party.

383
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,332
I'm sorry about him, by the way.

384
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,917
- Who, Larry?
- No, Murray.

385
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,795
He's a sick individual
who likes to get under people's skin.

386
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,090
So, let's not let him, you know,
get under our skin.

387
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,258
I'm not, I haven't.

388
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,218
I just, you seem
a little more quiet than usual.

389
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,428
- I just... I just wanna find the kids.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,846
I'll give it my best shot.

391
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,183
You won yourself a bear!

392
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,894
Thank you. Here you go.

393
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,020
Mayor Kline!

394
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,481
One more, one more.

395
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,111
Big smile. There we go.

396
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,952
- Watch it!
- Happy Fourth, dick.

397
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,168
Come on, come on, come on!

398
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,671
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
you commie bastards!

399
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,486
- Quiet.
- Oh, sorry.

400
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,951
- How do you even drink that?
- Because it's delicious.

401
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,036
What?

402
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,121
It's like Carpenter's <i>The Thing.</i>

403
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,914
The original is a classic,

404
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,499
no question about it.

405
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,293
But the remake...

406
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,680
Sweeter, bolder...

407
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,766
better.

408
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,142
You're insane.

409
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,811
So, you prefer the original <i>Thing?</i>

410
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,148
What? No, I'm not talking about <i>The Thing,</i>
I'm talking about New Coke.

411
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,650
It's the same concept, dude.

412
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,401
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.

413
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,611
It is the same concept.

414
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,029
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

415
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,197
Hey.

416
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,823
Sorry.

417
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,075
Sorry.

418
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,579
Did you... find him?

419
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,125
The movies?

420
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,754
Dustin's so freaked out about the gate,
he decides to go watch a movie?

421
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,047
Yeah, makes total sense.

422
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,132
You're positive he said "gate"
and not "great"?

423
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,051
Yeah, like,
"This movie I'm watching is great."

424
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:58,968
Sounded like "gate."

425
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,137
Which would explain how
the Mind Flayer's still alive.

426
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,682
- Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
- Then the monster dies.

427
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,101
But if not,
we always have Lucas' fireworks.

428
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,770
Keep mocking my plan, Max.
Keep mocking it.

429
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,356
I wanna hear you say it again,
because you keep doubting me.

430
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,440
You keep doubting me!

431
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,109
- Ridiculous.
- Will?

432
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,027
We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right?

433
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,880
The ceiling stopped spinning for me.

434
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,966
Is it still spinning for you?

435
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,636
Holy shit.

436
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,471
No.

437
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,849
You think we puked it all up?

438
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,268
Maybe. Ask me something.

439
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,061
Interrogate me.

440
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,813
Okay. Interrogate you. Sure.

441
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,981
Um...

442
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,443
When was the last time
you, uh, peed your pants?

443
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,694
Today.

444
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,778
What?

445
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,780
When the Russian doctor
took out the bone saw.

446
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,490
Oh, my God.

447
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,492
It was just a little bit, though.

448
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,745
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.

449
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,914
Oh...

450
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,958
- All right, my turn.
- Okay.

451
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,209
Hit me.

452
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,296
Have you...

453
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,759
ever been in love?

454
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,137
Yep. Nancy Wheeler.

455
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,597
First semester, senior year.

456
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,808
Oh, my God.

457
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,269
She's such a priss.

458
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,729
Hm.

459
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,148
Turns out, not really.

460
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,443
Are you still in love with Nancy?

461
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,030
- No.
- Why not?

462
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,494
I think it's because I found someone
who's a little bit better for me.

463
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,579
It's crazy.

464
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,332
Ever since Dustin got home,
he's been saying,

465
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,210
"You know, you gotta find your Suzie.
You gotta find your Suzie."

466
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,628
Wait, who's Suzie?

467
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,464
It's some girl from camp,
I guess his girlfriend.

468
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,884
To be honest with you,
I'm not 100% sure she's even real.

469
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,721
But that's not...
that's not really the point.

470
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,766
That doesn't matter. The point is,
this girl, you know, the one that I like,

471
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,063
it's somebody that I...
didn't even talk to in school.

472
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,149
And I don't even know why.

473
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,110
Maybe 'cause Tommy H.
would've made fun of me or...

474
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,488
I wouldn't be...

475
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,698
prom king.

476
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,037
It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right,
it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.

477
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,413
Because, when I think about it,

478
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,791
I should've been hanging out
with this girl the whole time.

479
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,210
First of all, she's hilarious.
She's so funny.

480
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,171
I feel like, this summer,
I have laughed harder

481
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,506
than I have laughed...

482
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,675
in a really long time.

483
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,093
And she's smart.

484
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,887
Way smarter than me.

485
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,433
You know, she can crack, like,
top secret Russian codes and...

486
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,146
You know? She's honestly unlike anyone
I've ever even met before.

487
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,403
Robin?

488
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,285
Robin, did you just OD in there?

489
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,537
No.

490
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,205
I...

491
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,457
am still alive.

492
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,136
The floor's disgusting.

493
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,307
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood
and puke on my shirt, so...

494
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,852
What do you think?

495
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,812
About?

496
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,564
This girl.

497
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,940
She sounds awesome.

498
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,735
She is awesome. And what about the guy?

499
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,988
I think he's on drugs,
and he's not thinking straight.

500
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,782
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking
a lot more clearly than usual.

501
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,242
He's not.

502
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,287
Look...

503
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,124
he doesn't even know this girl.

504
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,293
And if he did know her,

505
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,128
like... like really know her,

506
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,673
I don't think he'd even want to be
her friend.

507
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,176
No, that's not true. No way is that true.

508
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,844
Listen to me, Steve.

509
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,388
It's shocked me to my core,

510
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,390
but I like you.

511
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,684
I really like you.

512
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,228
But I'm not like your other friends.

513
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,690
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.

514
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,859
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.

515
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,446
Do you remember what I said
about Click's class?

516
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,991
About me being jealous and, like,
obsessed?

517
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,660
Yeah.

518
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,996
It isn't because I had a crush on you.

519
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,208
It's because...

520
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,878
she wouldn't stop staring at you.

521
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,714
Mrs. Click?

522
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,427
Tammy Thompson.

523
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,722
I wanted her to look at <i>me.</i>

524
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,018
But... she couldn't
pull her eyes away from you

525
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,188
and your stupid hair.

526
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,775
And I didn't understand,
because you would get

527
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,487
bagel crumbs all over the floor.

528
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,907
And you asked dumb questions.

529
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,201
And you were a douchebag.

530
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,662
And... And you didn't even like her and...

531
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,122
I would go home...

532
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,250
and just scream into my pillow.

533
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,336
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.

534
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,006
Steve.

535
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,507
Yeah?

536
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,637
Oh.

537
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,305
Oh.

538
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,350
Holy shit.

539
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,060
Yeah.

540
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:42,979
Holy shit.

541
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,034
Steve...

542
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,202
did you OD over there?

543
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,329
No, I just, uh...

544
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,790
just thinking.

545
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,875
Okay.

546
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,211
I mean, yeah.

547
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,591
Tammy Thompson, you know,
she's cute and all, but...

548
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,052
I mean,

549
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,469
she's a total dud.

550
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,763
She is not.

551
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,556
Yes, she is.
She wants to be, like, a singer.

552
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,641
She wants to move to, like,
Nashville and shit.

553
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,145
- She has dreams.
- She can't even hold a tune.

554
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,563
She's practically tone-deaf.
Have you heard her?

555
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,857
All the time.

556
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,275
♪ <i>You see me now tonight ♪</i>

557
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,819
- Shut up.
<i>- ♪ You see me... ♪</i>

558
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,030
- She does not sound like that.
- She sounds exactly...

559
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,989
- That's a great impersonation of her.
- She does not.

560
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,158
You sound like a Muppet.

561
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,743
<i>She </i>sounds like a Muppet.

562
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,870
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.

563
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,581
<i>♪ And if you could hold me tight ♪</i>

564
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,251
<i>♪ We'll be holding on forever ♪</i>

565
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,128
- Exactly.
- I know!

566
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,842
Okay.

567
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,761
What the hell?

568
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,559
And why all this?

569
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,146
If I just turn the keys,
it's like turning off a car.

570
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,274
But then the car still works, does it not?

571
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,817
Yes.

572
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,362
And do you want the car to still work
or do you want it to explode?

573
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,156
I want the car to explode.

574
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,366
Good. Then do this.

575
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,579
Just make sure you are nowhere near it
when it does. It is not pretty.

576
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,372
Turns people into dust.

577
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,332
And then...

578
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,334
It's over.

579
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,381
And I become an American citizen
and join in the fun, yes?

580
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,721
Who said you had to be an American
to join the fun?

581
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,647
It doesn't get
more American than <i>this,</i> my friend.

582
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,026
Fatty foods, ugly decadence,

583
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,944
rigged games...

584
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,989
Fifteen tickets, please.

585
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,372
- They are rigged, these games?
- Yes.

586
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,794
They do not look rigged.

587
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,505
That's just it, my dear Alexei.

588
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,217
They have been designed
to present the illusion of fairness!

589
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,428
But it's all a scam, a trick,

590
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,139
to put your money
in the rich man's pocket.

591
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,767
That, my dear friend, is...

592
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,727
<i>America.</i>

593
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,687
But, hey...

594
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,440
knock yourself out.

595
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,609
Where are you going?

596
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,154
To get us the closest thing to food
I can find.

597
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,503
Hey. Hey.

598
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,964
Karen.

599
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,258
Step right up!

600
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,426
...feel the wind push you back
and it's gonna...

601
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,929
- Hold on. Do we have seat belts?
- Hey, Karen.

602
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,846
Joyce!

603
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,599
Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here!

604
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,600
Where are the kids?

605
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,353
I... I haven't seen them.
I don't think they're here yet.

606
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,273
- You three, up against the wall!
- No, where are they?

607
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,525
Oh, my gosh,
I can hardly keep track these days.

608
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,485
Uh, they were at, uh...

609
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,529
Dustin's, then Lucas's,

610
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,072
- then Max's.
- Max...

611
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,366
You know how it is. Summer!

612
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,576
Probably getting into some kinda trouble.

613
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,249
Last warning, you two.
Up against the wall!

614
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,001
Hold the ride!

615
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,627
On your life, Magnum.

616
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,633
Woo! Here we go!

617
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,593
Holy smokes!

618
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,638
Holy smokes!

619
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,484
<i>Roads?</i>

620
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,654
<i>Where we're going,</i>
<i>we don't need roads.</i>

621
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,056
And...

622
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,141
blend.

623
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,311
It is so good!

624
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,733
- Well, shit, that worked.
- Course it worked.

625
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,985
We just have to get on the bus
with the rest of these plebes,

626
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,445
and home sweet home, here we come.

627
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,697
- Uh, Dustin?
- What?

628
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,366
Yeah, we might not wanna
go to your house.

629
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,367
Why?

630
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,410
Well, I might've told them your full name.

631
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,580
- What is wrong with you?
- Dude, I was drugged.

632
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,040
- So?
- So?

633
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,668
So, you resist. You tough it out.
You tough it out like a man.

634
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,295
Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say.

635
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,380
Guys?

636
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,300
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Have a pleasant evening.

637
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:47,843
Abort.

638
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,764
Abort. Abort.

639
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:54,975
Shit.

640
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,143
Okay.

641
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,563
Come on, let's go, let's go.

642
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,113
That's three green!

643
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,365
And here's dart number four!

644
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,294
One more for the big prize!

645
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,088
You can do it, mister!

646
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,312
We have a winner!

647
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,151
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen!

648
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,194
Get your tickets right here!

649
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,571
Murray!

650
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,449
Look!

651
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,075
It's not rigged!

652
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,076
Ah!

653
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,413
It's not rigged.

654
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,142
Traitor.

655
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,321
Alexei!

656
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,550
Alexei!

657
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,429
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Let's go.

658
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,894
Easy.

659
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,981
Keep pressure on it.

660
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,691
I'll get you help.

661
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,151
I'll get help.

662
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,209
Jim... Jim.

663
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,752
Jim!

664
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,671
They got Alexei, Jim!

665
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,716
Jim! Alexei! They got Alexei, Jim!

666
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,014
We gotta go.

667
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,891
- We gotta go.
- What?

668
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,061
Let's go.

669
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,738
They make an odd couple, don't they?

670
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,283
Well, it's like they say,

671
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,243
there's someone for everyone.

672
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,338
Who wants a hot dog?

673
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,092
Find Murray, get the car,

674
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,594
- bring it around back.
- Okay.

675
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,436
Heading to "Big Top."

676
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,104
Northeast side of the fair.

677
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,399
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen!

678
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,152
Get your tickets to the Big Top here!

679
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,364
this side of the Mississippi.

680
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,492
Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police!

681
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,453
Get 'em out of here! Go!

682
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,412
You, sir!

683
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,247
Step on up!

684
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,499
I see you eyeing the maze!

685
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,294
Don't be surprised! Don't be scared!

686
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,671
Step on up, sir!

687
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,471
<i>Do you dare enter the cave of horrors?</i>

688
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,892
<i>You never know what you might find</i>
<i>around the corner.</i>

689
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:10,856
<i>Don't show your fear</i>
<i>in the presence of the tiger.</i>

690
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,027
<i>Or you may never escape this cave alive.</i>

691
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,128
Alexei!

692
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,507
Oh, my God.

693
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,385
I... I just left for a minute...

694
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,844
for a corn dog.

695
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,222
A stupid corn dog.

696
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,265
Oh, God.

697
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,852
Oh, no.

698
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,272
<i>Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer!</i>

699
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,752
What are you doing?

700
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,547
Hey!

701
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,008
- Larry.
- Joyce.

702
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,889
Ooh!

703
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,349
Yeah, lady!

704
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,565
Hey.

705
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,125
Comrade!

706
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,502
Get off me!

707
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,929
Goddamn!

708
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,014
Son of a bitch!

709
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,397
Hey!

710
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,943
Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go!

711
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,780
Alexei?

712
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,955
<i>On the lower level...</i>

713
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,748
Hey, translate.

714
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,167
<i>We've found the children.</i>

715
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,504
<i>They are still in the mall. Lower level.</i>

716
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,424
Keep all entrances locked down.

717
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,341
I repeat...

718
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,385
Keep all entrances locked down.

719
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,129
Everyone, get over here.

720
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,505
I found them.

721
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,209
What the hell?

722
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,841
You flung that thing
like a Hot Wheel!

723
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,761
- Lucas?
- What are you doing here?

724
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,179
Ask them. It's their fault.

725
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,473
True, yeah. Totally true.
It's absolutely our fault.

726
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,058
I don't understand what happened
to that car.

727
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,184
El has superpowers.

728
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,186
- I'm sorry?
- Superpowers. She threw it with her mind.

729
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,938
- C'mon, catch up.
- That's El?

730
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,149
- Who's El?
- I'm sorry, who are you?

731
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,901
- I'm Robin. I work with Steve.
- She cracked the top secret code.

732
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,820
Yeah, which is how we found out
about the Russians.

733
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,196
Russians? Wait, what Russians?

734
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,157
- The Russians!
- Those were Russians?

735
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,325
- Some of them.
- What are you talking about?

736
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,827
- Didn't you hear our code red?
- Yeah.

737
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,455
- Couldn't understand what you were saying.
- Goddamn low battery.

738
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,540
How many times do I have to tell you
with the low battery?

739
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,167
Well, everything worked out, didn't it?

740
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,420
- Worked out? We almost died.
- Yeah, but we didn't, did we?

741
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,298
- It was pretty damn close.
- Okay, Russians?

742
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,633
As in, they're working for
the Russian government?

743
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,053
What are you not comprehending?

744
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,387
Am I not speaking English?

745
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,140
We have a full-blown <i>Red Dawn</i> situation.

746
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,142
So this has nothing to do
with the gate?

747
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,478
It has <i>everything </i>to do
with the gate...

748
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,732
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

749
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,984
El! El!

750
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,611
- What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong?

751
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,112
My leg. My leg.

752
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,113
Her leg, her leg. Okay.

753
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,449
- Get that off.
- Okay.

754
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,834
El! El!

755
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,921
El! El, are you okay?

756
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,839
El! El!

757
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,924
El!
