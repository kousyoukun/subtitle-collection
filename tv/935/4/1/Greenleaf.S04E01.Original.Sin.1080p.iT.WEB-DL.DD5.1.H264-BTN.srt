00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,202
    -Just stop right there.
       -We have a search

3
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,470
  and seizure warrant, ma'am.
       Please step aside.

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,706
   Jacob transferred $200,000

5
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,342
        of church funds
   into what turned out to be

6
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,244
      -a personal account.
         -It's Connie.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,812
        <i> She's talking</i>
   <i> with Phillip DeMars again</i>

8
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,714
       <i> about us joining</i>
      <i> Harmony and Hope.</i>

9
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,315
 I'll see that doesn't happen.

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,218
    [Phil] Connie's told me
she's talked to you in the past

11
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,719
       about stepping up.

12
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,721
These folks want change, Grace.

13
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,390
    You want me to take over
          the church.

14
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,358
    This is an opportunity.

15
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,528
        Harmony and Hope
      is a gigantic deal.

16
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,130
   <i> Bob Whitmore, he is one of</i>
  <i> the richest men in America.</i>

17
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,201
 What we're gonna need from you
this year, Grace, is your voice.

18
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,738
     A voice that can unify
       this congregation.

19
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,174
Are you ready to be that voice?

20
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,810
      Even beating me down
  with your holy superiority,

21
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,047
 -you were just another sinner.
      -I know that, James.

22
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,483
 Aaron and I took a blood test.
      Lionel's my father.

23
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,186
      You are my daughter
    and you always will be.

24
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,555
[Grace] This family, this faith.

25
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,825
  We ask that you let it give
  us strength and sustenance,

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,593
    so that we can take back
         what is ours.

00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,678
     Good morning, Calvary!

42

   -[audience] Good morning!
        -[Bob chuckles]

43
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,716
    Wasn't that a wonderful
 performance we just saw, huh?

44
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,618
           [cheering]

45
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,620
      So much energy. Wow!

46
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,656
   And what a blessing it is
       to be looking down

47
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,192
on all of these beautiful faces
         this morning.

48
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,429
  -[man] All right, all right.
  -[Bob] And hats. [chuckles]

49
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,864
         So many hats!

50
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,734
  I don't think I've ever seen
     so many beautiful hats

51
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,236
         -in one room.
     -[audience murmuring]

52
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:22,474
   Anyway, I'm Bob Whitmore,
 president of Harmony and Hope.

53
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,379
     And I just want to say
     welcome to the family!

55
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:35,520
When Connie Sykes, your amazing
    Deacon Board President,

56
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,489
        first called me
       and Phil DeMars...

57
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,924
    That's Phil right there.

58
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,459
     He's our Southeastern
      Conference Minister.

59
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,862
 He's going to be officing here
          for a while.

60
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,864
             -Yes.
          -[applause]

61
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,902
    Well, I gotta tell you,
     we were over the moon.

62
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,738
We've been hearing about Calvary
           for years.

63
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,741
      All the great things
         you're doing,

64
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,410
 and it was more than one time
        I said to Phil,

65
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,579
"Phil, we gotta get in on that,
            buddy."

66
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,581
    You remember that, Phil?
           [chuckles]

67
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,449
           And I bet
 that's just what he said too.

68
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,517
              Shh.

69
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,718
"We gotta get in on that money."

70
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,220
       -[Bob] But then...
        -James, please,

71
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,589
 -keep your voice down, please.
-[Bob] ...you elected to join us

72
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,391
        and here we are.

73
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,693
     And we are so excited.

74
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,428
      But I'm not the one

75
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,598
     that you came to hear
      jabber this morning.

76
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,333
   You came to hear the Word!

77
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,769
          -[applause]
      -Amen, and so did I!

78
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,308
  So, let's get God's servant
     up here to preach it.

79
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,579
 -[indistinct chatter in crowd]
-You all know her and love her.

80
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,815
Your new interim Head Pastor...

81
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,586
   Reverend Grace Greenleaf.
          Give it up.

82
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,421
    [cheering and applause]

83
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,794
         Keep it short.

84
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,534
       Harmony and Hope!

85
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,775
         [Grace sighs]

86
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,555
           <i> ¶ Amen ¶</i>

87
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,558
            <i> ¶ Oh ¶</i>

00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,264
            <i> ¶ Oh ¶</i>

            <i> ¶ Oh ¶</i>

           <i> ¶ Amen ¶</i>

            <i> ¶ Oh ¶</i>

93
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,936
 We haven't seen you in church
      for a while, child,

94
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,971
      where have you been?

95
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,640
     Getting ready to leave
          for school.

96
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,309
  But September's so far away.

97
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,311
    It's called pre-college.

98
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,612
      Ah, you're in a rush
          to grow up?

99
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,714
          [chuckling]

100
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,550
          You sounded
    just like Bishop today.

101
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,685
Well, he is my father after all.

102
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,489
   -And a proud one, indeed.
   -[Grace] Thank you, Daddy.

103
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,893
Would you be a dear and help me
  find the coffee and cookies?

104
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,629
         They moved it.
    Everything's different.

105
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,465
  Oh, of course, Ms. Wharton.
         I'll help you.

106
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,469
      Decrepit old thing.

107
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,672
    She can't even face us,
  'cause she voted against us.

108
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,774
         James, please,
      don't make a scene.

109
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,444
  -How are you two holding up?
       -[Lady Mae sighs]

110
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,880
      I feel like a ghost
    moving unseen in a house

111
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,349
     that I lovingly built.

112
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,985
             -Mama.
              -Mm?

113
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,354
 You look like you have notes.

114
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,023
            Well...

115
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,993
your sermon was rather concise.

116
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,629
 -Bob told me to keep it short.
       -[Lady Mae scoffs]

117
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,498
 And you felt required to obey?

118
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,100
 With any luck, they'll be out
       of here in a year.

119
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,002
I'm gonna give that Connie Sykes
           an earful.

120
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,938
 Daddy, we-- We're gonna stick
     to the plan, remember?

121
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,840
     We're gonna play nice
     with Harmony and Hope,

122
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,808
    and we're gonna win back

123
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,510
      the hearts and minds
     of this congregation.

124
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,746
  And then, when Bob makes me
    permanent Head Pastor

125
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,582
     of this interim year,
       we'll take a vote

126
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,752
   to leave H&H and I'll hand
    the church over to Mama.

127
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,689
Only if there's a church worthy
   of the name to hand over.

128
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,924
  How many folks do you think
     would keep coming back

129
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,693
 week after week for a seance?

130
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,695
Look, there's Connie Sykes now.

131
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,830
            -N-- No!
      -[James] Excuse me.

132
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,133
-James. No, James. Listen to me.
             -What?

133
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,702
        Grace is right.

134
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,570
             What?

135
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,909
Nothing, I'm just gonna sit here
   and watch the two of you,

136
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,611
   suddenly thick as thieves.

137
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,212
    You go stomp over there

138
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,181
        the first Sunday
       of the new regime,

139
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,050
  demanding your church back,
   well, it will be churlish.

140
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,890
  Fine, I will submit to your
   feminine wisdom this time.

141
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,493
   For now. But not happily.

142
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,061
    Okay, I'm gonna go meet
           with Phil.

143
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,630
          -All right.
       -Well, listen, uh,

144
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,533
   don't forget about Charity
           and Jacob.

145
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,967
     I won't, Dad. I won't.

146
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,738
 Lord, I hope she's up to this.

147
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,508
She's the only one in the family
        that the deacons

148
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,910
   will sign off on, but I--
     I share your concern.

149
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,946
 Stay here. I'll be right back.

150
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,215
      Where are you going?

151
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,851
To pay my respects to the dead.

152
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,955
    -That woman was on fire!
         -Yes, she was!

153
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:42,727
    -Lady Mae. God is good.
   -All the time. [chuckles]

154
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,863
   Bob was just saying, Mae,

155
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,798
    what a wonderful sermon
        Grace delivered.

156
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,200
    Was that a sermon?

157
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:52,570
   Well, it seemed more like
      a Minister's Minute.

158
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,738
              -Oh!
     -Like the ones I heard

159
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,507
   -on the radio as a child.
          -[chuckles]

160
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,242
I knew you'd think it was short.

161
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,678
Well, I wouldn't say short, Bob.
             Uh...

162
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
         insufficient.

163
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,950
  Well, the offering certainly
        was sufficient.

164
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,953
        Do you know
   it would never occur to me

165
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,856
    to use money as a metric

166
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,725
     when measuring things
   of the spirit. [chuckles]

167
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,226
 Oh, it's not just about money.

168
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,762
Grace got the folks out the door
            on time.

169
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,031
      -Yes, you are right.
  -Oh, so that's the new goal

170
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,066
       around here, huh?

171
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,101
    To make sure the trains
      are running on time.

172
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:27,205
  Well, did anybody ask Jesus
     about that? [chuckles]

173
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,242
  I would like to try fitting
      in a third service.

174
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,844
 I think the Finance Committee
      would like that too.

175
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,746
          -[Bob] Hmm.
    -Struggle is real.

176
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,583
[Bob] Plus, on any given Sunday,
  we have thousands of members

177
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,586
  all over the world traveling
   for business or pleasure,

178
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,989
       who like to know,
     they've told us this,

179
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,225
       they like to know
   no matter which H&H church

180
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,094
        they walk into,
    what they're gonna get.

181
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,163
       -Like McDonald's.
 -[Bob] Like the Lord himself,

182
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,667
   who is the same yesterday,
      today and tomorrow.

183
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,569
   [Lady Mae] You know, Bob,
      I really don't wanna

184
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,771
      belabor this point.
 Especially, since it's Sunday.

185
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,740
      You know, when I try
       to restrain myself

186
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,976
   from any full-on warfare,

187
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,613
    but there are two things
 that human beings do together

188
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,115
    that's best done slowly.

189
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:11,983
              Mm.

190
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,819
   Preaching is one of them.

191
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,755
         [Connie] Mae!

192
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,925
   I'm all for long sermons.

193
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,998
Make quite a few of them myself,
   but I also run a business.

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,002
     Now, if you two lovely
  young ladies will excuse me,

195
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,071
 I think I'd better call home.

196
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,979
          I don't know
  what you think you're doing

197
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,682
   chatting him up like that,
      but make no mistake,

198
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,618
        neither I or any
      of the other Deacons

199
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,121
  care a whit that the Bishop
      gave you the church.

200
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,724
     It wasn't his to give.

201
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,126
    And no one wants to see
        you running it.

202
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,930
    Not now, not next year,
           not ever.

203
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,069
          Oh, Connie.

204
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,072
      What do you want to
        talk about now?

205
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,776
            Nothing.

206
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,354
     So, we're good to go.

207
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,622
            Almost.

208
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,392
 I saw in your proposal, Grace,
           one thing,

209
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,127
  two, really, that I think...

210
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,830
  Bob might have trouble with.

211
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,634
             Okay.

212
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,168
    Your brother and sister,

213
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,106
    I mean, installing them
     as Associate Pastors,

214
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,241
Bob's not gonna go for that.

215
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,344
  Your brother barely avoided
    being charged with fraud

216
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,412
        over at Triumph.

217
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,382
 He was framed by Basie Skanks.

218
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,084
   And as far as your sister,
           Charity...

219
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,719
    Forty thousand followers
         on Soundcloud,

220
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,754
           -that's--
         -[Phil] Grace.

221
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,957
She almost got herself arrested
   for kidnapping in Florida.

222
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,027
  Look, it is important to me
 to give my brother and sister

223
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,764
    a place in the structure
        of this church.

224
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,801
        Important to you
        or your parents?

225
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,369
   Because it's not important
             to us,

226
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,173
     and no one in the pews
         is clamoring.

227
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,011
 Okay, so maybe they don't have
       to be associates.

228
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,213
 Maybe we call them assistants
          or adjuncts?

229
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,915
         -I don't care.
            -Grace.

230
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,018
  It's never going to happen.

231
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,195
    Oh, so sorry I couldn't
        be there, Judee,

232
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,397
   but you know how important
  it is to get a buy-in from--

233
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,167
    Oh, Mr. Greenleaf, hey!

234
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,370
        Yeah. [chuckles]
     Uh, sorry I-- I-- I--

235
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,739
      Circulation problem.
         My-- My feet.

236
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,875
       -You got a second?
  -For you, Bishop, of course.

237
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,045
       Okay, Judee, you--
    You tell that little man

238
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,715
     his Grandpa loves him.
           Okay? Bye.

239
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,185
      Sorry, I've invaded.
        My battery died,

240
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,188
-I needed somewhere to plug in.
     -Oh, don't apologize.

241
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,490
What did you want to talk about?

242
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,292
Mike Evans was a friend of mine.

243
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,394
       Mike Evans, uh...

244
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,996
      -Sorry I-- I don't--
       -He was the Pastor

245
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,432
for the Jericho Faith Fellowship
         in Galveston.

246
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,035
           Oh, yeah,
  that's one of our churches.

247
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,937
     But it wasn't always.

248
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,506
  You and Phil tried for years

249
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,108
       to get him to hand
       that church over.

250
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,176
   But he wasn't interested.

251
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,881
So, you, you hired a PI to look
     into his private life.

252
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,017
Learned he acquired an addiction
       to pain medication

253
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,953
that he was taking for his back
  after an injury he sustained

254
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,089
     while building houses
  for the poor after Katrina.

255
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,359
      And then you shared
that information with his board,

256
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,895
   and they had him removed.

257
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,330
       Within six months

258
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,467
    that church became H&H,
    and Mike Evans is dead.

259
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,339
    -Doesn't sound like H&H.
 -Oh, it sounds just like H&H.

260
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,008
   What it doesn't sound like
            is God.

261
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,881
  Well, I'm glad we were there
     to pick up the pieces

262
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,550
    after things went south
        for your friend.

263
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,153
         It's not good
   when congregations suffer

264
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,922
 for the sins of their leaders.

265
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,325
           Or is it?

266
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,094
         Maybe you have
   a different take on this.

267
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,364
-If you do, I'd love to-- What?
             -Bob.

268
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,967
          I don't know
   what you're doing here...

269
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,472
   or why Calvary is suddenly
      so important to you

270
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,809
or how you weaseled your way in,
     but I'm gonna find out

271
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,510
         and when I do,

272
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,880
       you're gonna watch
    your whole magic carpet

273
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,150
   of a denomination dissolve
   underneath you like smoke.

274
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,087
  And you're gonna fall, boy.

275
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,024
You're gonna fall hard and fast.

276
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,226
    You know what, James...

277
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,429
    Your days are numbered.

278
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,601
         I'm gonna pray
     the Lord releases you

279
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,570
 from the spirit of resentment.

280
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,371
It can't be good for your heart.

281
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,408
   Oh, and, uh, your ex-wife
     found me after church.

282
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,377
    What a spitfire she is!

283
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,215
How did you let her get away?
           [chuckles]

284
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,150
     Thanks for the charge.

285
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,091
            [scoffs]

286
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,971
        [phone ringing]

287
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,911
  Aaron, hey what's going on?

288
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,079
           Not much,
    just here at the office

289
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,481
     getting some work done
          on a Sunday.

290
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,350
You know, Calvary's technically
       open and inclusive

291
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,286
    now that we joined H&H.

292
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,921
You and Kevin should come visit.

293
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,256
         [scoffs] Boy,
they really must've paid off

294
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,624
  Connie Sykes big time, huh?

295
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:58,129
[chuckles] That's just a rumor,
           but, yeah.

296
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,932
   So, what's up, Counselor?

297
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,669
       -How'd church go?
     -[Grace]<i> Phil said no</i>

298
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,439
    <i> -to Jacob and Charity.</i>
        -Oh, I'm sorry.

299
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,641
             Yeah.

300
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,376
            [Aaron]
 <i> You knew he might not say yes.</i>

301
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,945
         Yeah, I know--
    I just wanted to be able

302
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,279
    to give them something,
           you know.

303
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,049
 Grace, trying to pay them off
           with jobs

304
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,017
      isn't that different
        from your mother

305
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,152
   keeping this all a secret.

306
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,321
What? It's completely different.

307
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,158
   No, it's just another way
     to smooth things over.

308
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,460
     You know, make it seem
    like nothing's changed,

309
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,196
  when really change might be
      what has to happen.

310
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,731
            [scoffs]

311
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,401
        <i> Grace? Grace?</i>

312
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,403
      <i> -You still there?</i>
             -Yeah.

313
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,072
 I'm just dealing with the fact

314
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,008
     that my little brother
       just schooled me.

315
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,044
           [chuckles]

316
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,456
        Mom, I'm trying
    to go over my monologue

317
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,592
-and Winkie won't stop farting.
    -Sorry, I can't help it.

318
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,095
        -[Jacob laughs]
       -It's your mother.

319
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,464
     How's my mother making
         your son fart?

320
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,100
  -Oh, so now he's my son now?
  -[chuckles] I'm just saying.

321
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,735
     -How does she do that?
            -Well...

322
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,037
  she lets Maricel put butter
         in everything

323
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,039
        when I told her
that Winkie can't handle dairy.

324
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,207
  Let me move into that cabin.

325
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,075
 The one Noah used to live in,
            please?

326
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,577
      I'll talk to Maricel
       about the butter.

327
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,178
      It's not about that.

328
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,314
    I am a grown-ass woman,
  and I'm about to start going

329
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,382
          -to college.
          -Excuse me?

330
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,284
 A grown woman talks like one.

331
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,721
      I need my own space.
      I need my own place!

332
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,623
      If anybody's moving
        into that cabin,

333
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,791
       -it's gonna be me.
             -Dad--

334
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,026
       So take a number!

335
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,028
  Hey, after that foolishness
    you pulled with Isaiah,

336
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,263
    no way we're letting you
       out of our sight.

337
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,331
            Yes.

338
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,634
And we switched you over to SCC
           this year,

339
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,037
so that we could keep you close.

340
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,239
         Nobody can be
      this close to that.

341
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,574
        [phone ringing]

342
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,545
 Can I just ask Grandma myself?

343
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,115
            -Please?
    -Yeah, sure, ask her.

344
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,485
    -She's gonna say no too.
-Okay, well, come on, stinkbutt.

345
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,761
          -Who called?
 -Don't worry, it wasn't Tasha.

346
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,265
       -Who was it then?
        -Doris Saunders.

347
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,634
   And who's Doris Saunders?

348
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,502
         -Tasha Skanks?
         -[Jacob sighs]

349
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,837
            [Jacob]
  When you gonna let that go?

350
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,640
    It's been a week, Jacob.
            A week.

351
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,110
   Doris Saunders is a member
       at Triumph, okay?

352
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,678
      What would she want
         with you now?

353
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,380
I mean, I don't know, who knows?

354
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,315
          H-- How come
      I've never met her?

355
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,485
    Well, how often were you
          at Triumph?

356
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,220
     You're always so busy
         at Excellence.

357
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,122
              No.
            [scoffs]

358
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,425
        For all we know,
   Basie, Tasha and Rochelle

359
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,162
 are still out there somewhere
      trying to set us up.

360
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,167
        Don't call back.

361
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,170
          Yes, ma'am.

362
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,209
      I want her moved in
       before I get back

363
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,410
    from Fairview tomorrow.

364
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,080
Yeah, I'll make sure it happens.

365
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,482
           Every day,
    this office sits vacant

366
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,851
   is another day her father
      and all his acolytes

367
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:10,488
     can keep nursing hopes
  this is all some bad dream.

368
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,257
  Can you believe she's trying
      to hire her brother

369
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,492
      and sister as AP's?

370
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,128
 Yeah, that didn't surprise me.

371
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,097
       Yeah, the sister's
       not even a pastor.

372
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,133
    Phil, I can't fault her
           for that.

373
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,901
Well, you're not thinking about
       letting her do it.

374
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,837
  -Let her hire them, are you?
        -No, no, never.

375
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,406
     But I don't blame her.

376
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,176
   If I was in her position,

377
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,845
     I would've tried to do
        the same thing,

378
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,214
   even if it was just to say
            I tried.

379
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,884
     Hey, why are you, uh,
       going to Fairview?

380
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,721
  Mm, just to look in on Cal.

381
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,157
 Yeah, he's barely hanging on.

382
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,925
         I haven't seen
  a denominational dues check

383
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,426
        from that church
        in three years.

384
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,461
             Yeah.

385
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,365
    While I'm out that way,
I'm also gonna stop by Bethel,

386
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,768
      Sinai, Olive Branch,
     do the whole circuit.

387
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,205
Hey, you want me come with you?
 We can do the whole little...

388
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,141
      -good cop, bad cop.
        -No, no, no, no.

389
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,210
 -You sure you don't want any?
   -No, no. I'm good, thanks.

390
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:23,294
  -So, you got us dookie? Oh!
       -Charity, I tried.

391
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,430
         Oh, I'm sorry,
  you tried and got us dookie.

392
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,498
         Can-- What...
            [sighs]

393
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,233
   Can you please stop using
        that foul word?

394
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,169
     Your nephew is sitting
          right here.

395
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,204
 [Charity] I'm glad he's here,
      he needs to hear it.

396
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,674
     Don't expect anything
       from your sister,

397
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,442
and you won't be disappointed.

398
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,346
     Did you tell this Phil
   that you wouldn't stay on

399
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,781
           as interim
      without your brother

400
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,882
     and sister's support?

401
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,584
            Kerissa,
  we have next to no leverage.

402
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,919
      Do either of you two
        understand that?

403
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,722
    if I quit, they will put
   Phil DeMars in the pulpit,

404
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,924
  and then we'll have dookie.

405
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,893
        I'm not so sure
       what we have now.

406
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,962
 You have someone who's trying
    to get this church back.

407
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,799
            -Trying.
      -Yeah, trying. What?

408
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,569
Oh, Grace, I can still remember
 the first night you came home.

409
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,837
        You were saying
       all that nonsense

410
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,873
about how God is the part of us
           who tries.

411
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,610
        Well, right now,
   trying doesn't cut it, G.

412
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:13,678
       You better preach.

413
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,781
    Charity, there's no need
           for that.

414
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,317
   Ever since you came home,

415
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:23,754
      this family has been
     on a swift slide down,

416
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,657
  and I have slid the farthest
            of all.

417
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,559
           [Lady Mae]
   And what have you suffered

418
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,427
   that even vaguely compares

419
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,896
         to what Bishop
      and I have suffered,

420
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,831
    are suffering, Kerissa?

421
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,500
          Mm-hmm, see,
  I'm not getting any argument

422
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,637
      on the net effect...
      of your homecoming.

423
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,940
  -Okay, you made your point.
 -Well, if she hadn't come back

424
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,541
   these two would be married
          and retired.

425
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,410
          You would be
    Head Pastor of Calvary.

426
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,412
          None of this
  would've even have happened.

427
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,714
          I'm not sure
     that's entirely true.

428
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,016
Oh, I would have made it happen.

429
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,584
        -[James] Really?
           -Oh, yes.

430
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,286
          Fascinating.

431
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,523
Yes, so instead of sitting here,
  saying that you tried, Gigi,

432
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,059
like that's some kind of divine
         yellow ribbon,

433
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,329
you need to go back to this Phil
   and make something happen

434
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,764
  for your brother and sister!

435
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,033
          For anybody
  besides your own damn self!

436
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,777
        Excuse me, Mama.

437
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,757
    You can, uh, side-eye me
       all you want, Mae,

438
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,760
   but I have earned my place
     in this conversation,

439
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:41,966
 ten times over, and my opinion
    is as good as anybody's.

440
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,768
    Not when it is delivered
        with a stridency

441
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,470
      of screeching pride.

442
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,640
        You want to talk
      about foul language,

443
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,476
       do you ever think
 about what both your children

444
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,778
might learn from your attitude?

445
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,648
You must know you in the wrong,
            Kerissa!

446
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,052
 What I know, come on, baby...

447
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,889
   is that I can't live here.

448
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,461
        [James] You need
    to handle your business,

449
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,396
 and keep her out of the wine.

450
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,065
  It's been hard moving back.

451
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,834
           [Lady Mae]
   And what is the hard part?

452
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,904
    The staff, the 50 acres
          or the rent?

453
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,673
Which as far as I know is free.

454
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,546
           So, wait,
is Gigi going to talk to Phil...

455
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,582
       or-- or who is it?
   What-- What is happening?

456
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,752
  -I'll see she talks to Bob.
             -Good.

457
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,555
   'Cause I'm not going back
          to singing.

458
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,926
You know, Satan can take a gift
    that God has given you,

459
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,762
     and use it to hold you
          in bondage.

460
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,097
              Oh!

461
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,933
You know, that's what I'm gonna
   preach about when I'm AP.

462
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,870
         Satan's ways!
  I'm gonna do a whole series.

463
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,439
      Okay, you know what,
      what makes you think

464
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,007
       -you gonna be AP?
    -[Charity] 'Cause I am.

465
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,642
    [Jacob] I'm gonna be AP
          before you.

466
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,478
     -[Charity] Oh, please.
 -[Jacob] Why you always trying

467
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,679
 -to do a series on something?
  -[Charity] Jacob! Whatever.

468
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,747
     [Jacob] Whatever what?

469
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,551
     The sins and stupidity
   this poor table has seen,

470
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,020
    I'm surprised it doesn't
    just crash to the floor.

471
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,125
            [sighs]

472
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,794
          Mm, mm, mm.

473
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,211
 -You didn't do anything wrong.
         -Tell Charity.

474
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,815
  And I know why Phil said no
 and why Bob probably will too.

475
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,783
Charity shouldn't preach anyway.

476
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,152
          She probably
     shouldn't even drive.

477
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,421
         And does Jacob
       even wanna be AP?

478
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,189
     Oh, Kerissa wants it,
         that's enough.

479
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,057
   [scoffs] Kerissa is worse
         than charity.

480
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,125
         You're right.

481
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,062
  But this is not about them.

482
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,767
 This is about what you can do
 to keep this family together.

483
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,804
  Can we please just tell them
  that I'm Lionel's daughter?

484
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,608
 I'm so tired of having this...
  secret hanging over my head.

485
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,977
          It's my head
    that it's hanging over.

486
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,149
        I'm not talking
   about my reputation, Mama.

487
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,020
  I am talking about who I am,
     my identity, my life.

488
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,026
      We will tell them...

489
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,197
        once we have won
       this church back,

490
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:32,203
 and we're all sitting together
in-- in-- in victory and unity.

491
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,844
I'll ask Bob about it tomorrow.

492
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,614
          Don't ask...

493
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,183
             tell.

494
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,702
    [footsteps approaching]

495
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,707
    That was Doris Saunders,
      I spoke to earlier.

496
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,742
 Why do I even bother talking?

497
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,111
         Her son plays
     for the Red Devils...

498
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,580
      and has been having
      some issues lately.

499
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,183
       So she's asked me
     to be his life coach.

500
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,519
     -How much does it pay?
         -I don't know.

501
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,555
But she wants me to go with her
 tomorrow to meet with the GM.

502
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,558
             Good.

503
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,147
        [clears throat]

504
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,554
      Yes, may I help you?

505
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,057
I was just in my quarters and...

506
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,092
              Yes?

507
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,127
            [sighs]

508
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,665
       When do you see me
 moving back up in here and...

509
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,767
    us sharing a bed again?

510
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,937
When we're remarried, of course.

511
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,307
  [chuckles] When do you think
        that should be?

512
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,276
      Well, I don't know,
      when we're in love.

513
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,011
   Isn't that when people do
      that kind of thing?

514
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,784
  You're not in love with me?

515
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,824
     I love you, James, I--
 I've never stopped loving you,

516
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,660
  but as far as being in love,
              I...

517
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,698
    Well, what do you want?
      Flowers and a ring?

518
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,635
              Yes.
  Yes, and more than that too.

519
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,839
   I'm not some country girl

520
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,174
        who's never been
        to the pictures.

521
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,311
  You're courting a woman now,
             James,

522
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,381
    who has had, literally,
          everything.

523
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,283
        [Lady Mae sighs]

524
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,124
So you'll just have to sweep me
          off my feet.

525
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,727
              How?

526
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,966
            [sighs]
           In ways...

527
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,839
   Ways I can't even imagine.

528
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,310
         Good to know.

529
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,689
          Good night.

530
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,036
         [phone beeps]

531
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,754
    [automated voice]<i> Hello.</i>
   <i> You have a message from...</i>

539
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,109
        [birds chirping]

540
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,950
         -Good morning!
  -Oh, look at my Bible buddy.

541
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,357
           Can I move
     into Noah's old cabin?

542
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,794
        Did your parents
      give you permission

543
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,362
        -to ask me that?
             -Yes.

544
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,765
              Hmm.

545
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,103
        I tell you what,

546
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,773
if you resume our Bible studies.

547
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,008
-That's at five in the morning.
             -Zora.

548
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,912
      Someday this church
       will be ours again

549
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,147
  which means it will be mine.

550
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,950
 And then maybe Aunty Grace's.

551
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,087
    And then maybe some day
       it will be yours.

552
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,555
     God will never call me
           to preach.

553
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,225
Oh, well, maybe he's calling you
           right now.

554
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,462
          Okay. Well--

555
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,164
            -[sighs]
        -How about 5:30?

556
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,433
        [laughs] Girl...

557
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,804
     The key's in my desk.

558
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,440
          -Thank you.
      -Oh, don't thank me,

559
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,476
           thank God
 because this is the beginning

560
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,978
     of a great adventure.

561
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,847
       Thank you so much.

562
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:48,918
 Hey, Grace, you got a second?

563
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,789
         So you moving
  into your new office today?

564
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,122
  I'll move in when I'm ready.

565
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,826
  Bob just wanted to make sure
           you did it

566
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,260
   before he got back today.

567
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,295
           [chuckles]

568
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,354
           [chuckles]

569
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,830
    [Noah]<i> Grace, it's Noah.</i>

570
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,833
        <i> Call me back.</i>
<i> We really need to talk.</i>

571
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:37,935
       <i> It's important.</i>

572
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,342
   [Charity] And so, I feel,
  with all of that behind me,

573
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,479
   losing Kevin to the gays,
     and my baby to Jesus,

574
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,282
  and shaking off those bonds
      of fear with Iyanla,

575
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,251
     I am ready to preach.

576
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,088
 Grace did bring the idea to us
        of you being AP.

577
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,557
  -[scoffs] And passionately.
         -Oh, whatever.

578
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,427
  I'm sure she did not express
everything that I just told you.

579
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,463
 -Well, that's definitely true.
        -See? I knew it.

580
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,365
     Because she hates me.

581
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,601
   And I would hate her too,
    if Jesus didn't tell me

582
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,903
      I couldn't, I would.

583
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,971
 Well, that's a separate issue

584
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,473
            -from--
         -Look, I know,

585
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,209
    you don't want too many
          Greenleafs,

586
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,911
    but I'm the good one.

587
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,648
        Well, I'm better
      than Grace at least.

588
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:28,986
       I tell you what...

589
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,655
   Phil, please don't ask me
   to be the music minister.

590
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,991
        Oh, I hear you.

591
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,362
     With that being said,
   if you were to be my, say,

592
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,531
         eyes and ears
     among the Greenleafs,

593
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,667
in the service of me making sure

594
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,936
      that once this year
 of transition is over that...

595
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:49,473
    I'd be made Head Pastor
        and not Grace...

596
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:55,579
  I'd definitely make you AP,
 in exchange for that kindness.

597
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,351
           Are you--
   Are you asking me to spy?

598
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,587
Well, no, I never said that word
       and I never would.

599
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,957
        I'm just saying,
      you scratch my back

600
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,558
   and I'll scratch yours...

601
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,261
            Pastor.

602
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,376
       [knocking on door]

603
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,047
      -Reverend Greenleaf!
        -[clears throat]

604
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,950
         Mr. Whitmore.

605
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,319
    Oh, you're all moved in.

606
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,287
 I was told it was a priority.

607
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,057
    Uh, Phil said you wanted
            to talk.

608
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,993
    Yeah, I do. Have a seat.

609
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,462
      What's on your mind?

610
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,269
   [Perry]<i> Pastor Greenleaf,</i>
      <i> Ms. Saunders here</i>

611
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,571
   speaks very highly of you
and now that I've had the chance

612
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,040
        to sit with you,
      I do understand why.

613
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,042
     That's great. Thanks.

614
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,577
       Hey, I'll take it.
           [chuckles]

615
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,145
  You should hear him preach.

616
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,248
   Yeah, well, that's kind of
 what I was about to bring up.

617
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,117
         It's no secret
    that Dante's a handful.

618
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,486
    Even in a game with more
  than his share of handfuls,

619
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,154
         he stands out
    as being a real handful.

620
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,689
           That's why
     we really want someone

621
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,725
in this position he'll respect.

622
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,294
      Someone impeccable.

623
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:20,096
 But you've sown your own share
         of wild oats,

624
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:20,997
   if I can trust the papers.

625
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,800
    Oh, well, uh, you know,
       I've been cleared

626
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,769
-of all wrong-doing at Triumph.
         -Yes, I know,

627
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,071
  but you're not even employed
   by a church at this point.

628
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,673
        Is that correct?

629
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,375
        That is correct.

630
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,078
      But, uh, I'm hoping
        to be reinstated

631
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,746
      as Associate Pastor
        back at Calvary.

632
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,515
    I should hear something
     by the end of the day.

633
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,118
         Uh, you know,
 definitely been praying on it.

634
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,654
      Perry, he's the one.
          God told me.

635
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,158
   This man is the one that's
gonna get my Dante through this.

636
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,194
   [Perry] Okay, well, uh...

637
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,230
 it's not like the owners are,
           you know,

638
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,800
    connoisseurs of decency,
    but, uh, sure would help

639
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,435
        if your name was
  on some church's letterhead.

640
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,636
      You know I'm saying?

641
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,238
        Loud and clear.

642
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,507
   Let me get this straight.

643
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,645
   You're ready to walk away
         from this job

644
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,781
        if I don't agree
to hire your brother and sister?

645
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,052
        -Just walk away?
-Yeah, and it's non-negotiable.

646
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,654
   And so what would you do?

647
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:23,093
   -What would I do if what?
 -If I say, "No, take a hike."

648
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,429
       You won't say no.

649
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,264
 Ever since you showed up here,
     you've been telling me

650
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,699
     how much you need me.

651
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,402
   Are you not worried at all

652
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,571
    about over-exaggerating
        your importance?

653
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,841
 Are you gonna hire my brother
       and sister or not?

654
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,443
            Grace...

655
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,381
    I've been following you
        for a long time.

656
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,785
     Even back in Phoenix.

657
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,657
       -Following me how?
            -On TV.

658
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,625
   <i> Grace Greenleaf Reports.</i>

659
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,461
            [scoffs]

660
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,163
   I could tell even then...

661
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,134
         you have more
 of the righteous truth in you

662
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,336
than any TV reporter could hold.

663
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,806
    If you can just put
    your family drama aside,

664
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,577
  this could be the beginning
    of a whole new chapter.

665
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,380
For you as the religious leader
God has always meant you to be.

666
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,818
         I need for you
 to hire my brother and sister

667
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,421
    as my associate pastors
          or I'm out.

668
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,193
      Putting family first
         is a mistake.

669
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,296
    It's what I have to do.

670
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,666
            Grace...

671
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,249
       Excuse me, ma'am.

672
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,251
  Is it okay if I take this up
 to your suite and put it away?

673
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,154
Yeah, that'll be fine, Maricel.
           Thank you.

674
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:01,191
      Oh, Lady Mae told me
         to tell you...

675
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,226
              Yes?

676
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,695
    ...she's fine with me
      doing your laundry,

677
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,265
but she'd like it if you did it
    on Tuesdays and Fridays

678
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,534
  with the rest of the house.

679
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:11,935
            [scoffs]

680
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,337
    I can just do it myself.

681
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,372
    She doesn't want anyone
         but the staff

682
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,508
      using the machines.
     They're very finicky.

683
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,912
 -If you could just do it on--
     -Tuesdays and Fridays.

684
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,413
            Got it.

685
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:25,815
       Thank you, ma'am.

686
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,423
        Hey, good news.

687
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,626
   Oh, please tell me you got
        that job.

688
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,561
        I've got to get
       out of this house.

689
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,965
 Well, hey, if Gigi gets me AP,
           we're set.

690
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,868
            -[sighs]
             -What?

691
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,971
  You just told me getting out
     from under your mother

692
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,339
        depends on Gigi.

693
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,374
     That's not good news.

694
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,477
            [sighs]

695
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,556
 [Sophia] So, who is this guy?

696
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,524
        Dante Saunders.

697
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,959
        The kid who ran
  over the Confederate statue

698
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,494
         -with his car?
            -Uh-huh.

699
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,964
     Yep, my dad's gonna be
     his spiritual adviser,

700
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,399
     life coach, whatever.

701
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,535
  I'm gonna be his love coach.

702
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,503
    Did it ever occur to you
      to pick out someone

703
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,739
    who isn't total trouble?

704
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,641
 What do you mean? He's a hero.

705
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,476
            I heard
   his blood alcohol content

706
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,777
         when he did it
      was off the charts.

707
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:28,979
       Who told you that?

708
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,181
            Roberto.

709
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,718
     He came by last night
        to say goodbye.

710
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,621
   Why do you have to leave?
           Just stay,

711
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,258
    be boring with Roberto,
     you can live with me.

712
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,563
   Look, I wish I could stay,
          but I can't.

713
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,765
            -[sighs]
             -Okay.

714
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,234
      I'm gonna miss you.

715
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,906
You are. You are gonna miss me.
           Come here.

716
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,946
 And I told him if I didn't get
    what I wanted, I'm out.

717
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,347
           Full stop.

718
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,049
              And?

719
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,685
   He said Jacob could be AP.

720
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,421
           Yes! See?

721
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,023
       [Grace] See what?

722
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,059
Oh, nothing. Uh, just thank you.

723
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,628
         What about me?

724
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,931
 He wouldn't do it. I'm sorry.

725
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,635
          So how come
     you still have a job?

726
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,674
           -Because--
-Well, that was the deal, right?

727
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:35,445
   Give me Jacob and Charity
           or I walk.

728
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,547
      Well, it seemed like
         once he said--

729
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,382
  How come you're not walking,
             Grace?

730
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,718
   Charity, once he said yes
     to the idea of Jacob,

731
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,453
      it didn't seem right
       to just continue--

732
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,488
 Oh, so you didn't push for me
            at all?

733
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,891
  I pushed as much as I could.

734
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,892
    And then when it stopped
         making sense,

735
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,594
            an idea
   you might not understand--

736
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,796
    So why Jacob and not me?

737
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,031
 Jacob's led a church, Charity.

738
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,967
Oh, so you're on Gigi's side now
 that you're getting everything

739
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,103
           -you want.
     -Oh, here goes crazy.

740
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,038
     You know what? I will
  whoop your ass, Stringbean!

741
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,473
     Bring it, Butterbean!

742
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,741
        -Really? Really?
         -Don't. Stop.

743
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:05,842
      Both of y'all, stop.

744
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,580
   None of you care about me.

745
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,117
     Would you please stop
        catastrophizing?

746
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,119
       Not one of you...

747
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,989
   has walked over to hug me

748
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:25,095
  or to say, "Sorry, Charity,
      I know this hurts."

749
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,464
   If you would just be quiet
     and have your feelings

750
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,900
      instead of spraying
   like some lose fire hose,

751
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,135
        -maybe we could.
             -Yeah.

752
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,705
          -Just watch.
-[Kerissa] Oh, Charity. Please--

753
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,806
      Just sit down, okay?

754
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,041
      [Charity] Why? Why?

755
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,778
 Because y'all the ones that's
  gonna get this church back,

756
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,847
    'cause y'all the A-Team?

757
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,015
    Well, when it's all said
           and done,

758
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,584
         you wanna know
    who's gonna be preaching

759
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:52,755
   and teaching and reaching
    for every possible star

760
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,758
  from behind that pulpit? Me!

761
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,961
        [Kerissa] Mm-mm.

762
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,730
       -[Kerissa scoffs]
 -Go ahead and laugh, Kerissa.

763
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,865
          Huh? What...

764
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,768
  I'm the one that's bringing
    dignity back to Calvary.

765
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:06,970
    Ain't that right, Daddy?

766
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,409
    -Yes, baby, but don't--
   -Pastor Charity Greenleaf.

767
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,781
'Cause God is good all the time.

768
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,118
          Hallelujah.

769
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,162
    -He's looking for Mama.
         -Mama's busy.

770
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,810
        [phone ringing]

771
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,116
         This is Phil.

772
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,552
            I'm in.

773
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,197
        [phone ringing]

774
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,539
           [exhales]

775
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,911
           Noah. Hey.

776
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,214
             Grace,
why haven't you called me back?

777
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,649
        I've been busy.

778
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,553
          -What's up?
    -I just got a phone call

779
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,522
        from some inmate
    at a prison in Arizona.

780
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:35,859
    <i> He says he's our son.</i>
