如果我过早去世，

我在我的财产里放了一个小文件，

告诉他们所有他们需要知道的关于你的事情

在收到文件后几小时内就死了

尽管如此，我还是找到了你，瑞克。

她想回家，去南非，

他们的皮肤像石头一样。

我们应该感谢这些人

是的，我们可以把这个放回你身边

只是说声谢谢如果你愿意的话

106
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,041
绝对不行
Hell no.

107
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,542
我们该怎么说？
What do we say?

108
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,245
新的东西出现了，总是把新的
New shit presents itself, always take the new--

109
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:14,057
我想...我想...现在就滚回去
I'd like-- I'd like to roll-- do the roll back now.

110
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,291
不知道
Nope.

111
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,760
没有他我们就活不下去了。
We wouldn't be alive without him.

112
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,429
我们怎么知道你不会对别人这么做？
How do we know you won't do this to someone else?

113
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:23,566
你不知道，但如果你让我和我的家人活着，
You don't, but if you let me and my family live,

114
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,969
我认为那是一次有启发性的经历。
I'd consider that an instructive experience.

115
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:28,138
答应我们，让别人去。
Promise us to let people be.

116
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:29,906
嗯.你说真的？
Hmm. You serious?

117
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:32,108
为什么你会在乎拯救别人
Why would you care about saving anybody's skin

118
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,977
除了你自己的
other than your own?

119
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:36,412
你照顾好自己。
You look after you.

120
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,082
这个世界上的任何东西都是童话。
Anything else in this world is a fairytale.

121
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,316
你觉得呢？
You think?

122
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,118
现在很难思考。
It's very hard to think right now.

123

好吧，不如你听我说？
Well, how about you just listen?

124
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:45,488
我在尿尿
I-I'm peeing.

125
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:48,091
我们救了你，唯一有危险的人
We saved you, and the only people in danger

126
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:52,963
被杀的原因不是这里的帮手
of being killed-- well, it isn't the helpers here.

127
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:57,734
你为什么不答应我们就相信你？
Why don't you just promise, and we'll believe you?

128
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:01,137
red.是啊
Red. Yeah.

129
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,472
是啊是啊
Yeah, yeah.

130
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,574
我就不管别人了。
I'll leave people be.

131
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:06,376
保证
Promise.

132
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,981
是啊是啊，这很公平
Yeah. Yeah, that's-- that's fair.

133
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:13,917
真的吗？
Really?

134
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,420
是的好吧
Yes. Okay.

135
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,223
我真的很期待。
I was really looking forward to that.

136
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,061
好吧嗯.
Okay. Hmm.

137
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,541
等我们走了再说
Wait 'til we're gone.

138
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,511
遵守你的承诺，混蛋。
Keep your promise, asshole.

139
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:50,453
红色的枪。
Red's red gun.

140
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:54,157
你觉得把另一个留给他们可以吗？
You think it was okay to leave them the other one?

141
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:59,362
我不认为他们会来找我们，如果你是这个意思的话。
I don't think they'll come after us, if that's what you mean.

142
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:02,165
也许他会信守诺言。
And maybe he'll keep that promise.

143
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:05,969
你刚才说的"来自人民的人民"是什么意思？
What were you saying about "the people from the people"?

144
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:08,471
我不知道
I don't know.

145
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:13,176
只是我脑子里有个问题。
It's just something that's stuck in my head.

146
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:16,379
保护人民不受人民的伤害。
Protect the people from the people.

147
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,315
你觉得他们能挺过来吗？
You think they would've made it?

148
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,417
如果我们不一起去呢？
What, if we hadn't come along?

149
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,752
我不知道
I don't know.

150
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:26,722
斧头断了，子弹不足，三个步行者。
Broken axe, low on bullets, three walkers.

151
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:30,193
他们走了这么远，就这样，
They'd made it this far, and just like that,

152
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:32,528
姐姐踩进了一个旧的陷阱。
the sister steps in an old snare.

153
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,998
幸运的是，有人在附近。

154
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:36,699
幸运的是，是我们。

155
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,535
是啊
Yeah.

156
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:42,372
我们都没想过。
We didn't even think about it.

157
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:44,307
不知道
Nope.

158
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:52,082
承认可能有点奇怪，但感觉很好。
Might be strange to admit it, but that felt good.

159
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,952
我们对抗世界。

160
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:59,055
或者保存它。

161
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:02,859
不过，我很惊讶你把面条收回来了。

162
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:07,363
他们拿枪指着我们。
They pulled a gun on us.

163
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,499
你可没吃面条。
You don't get noodles for that.

164
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:24,714
牙膏酒
Toothpaste, booze.

165
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:29,652
你在干什么，格莱姆斯？
What are you up to, Grimes?

166
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:32,388
我只是在利用我的能力。
I'm just working with what I got.

167

来吧，圣灵。

祝福这水，使它成为你的圣水。

的加百列

171
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,983
没事的我一个人
It's okay. I'm alone.

172
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:35,785
没事吧？
Is it okay?

173
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:38,888
即使你一个人？
Even if you are alone?

174
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:40,690
是啊
Yeah.

175
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,350
这又回来了吗？
Is this coming back?

176
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,052
号
No.

177
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,223
我只是想见见你。
I just wanted to see you.

178
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:18,128
但你不能告诉任何人我来过这里，好吗？
But you can't say to anyone that I was here, okay?

179
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,433
我在用尤金的业余无线电
I was using Eugene's ham radio with--

180
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:26,736
在罗西塔的帮助下想办法找到你
with Rosita's help, trying to somehow find you.

181
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,072
你找到我了
You-- You found me.

182
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,409
你离开是因为你被人评判
You left because you were being judged for things

183
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,945
你曾经做过的事
you did in your past

184
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:39,515
而不是你想成为的那个人
instead of who you were trying to be.

185
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:44,287
但我在谋划什么你信任我，
But I was up to something, and you trusted me,

186
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:45,721
那是个错误
and it was a mistake.

187
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,590
瑞克带你来是因为他相信
Rick brought you in because he believed

188
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,425
人们可以改变

189
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,096
他叫你"我们中的一员。”

190
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,768
他为了让人们团结而死。

191
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,938
他死了？

00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:07,577
桥

193
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:10,246
他不得不摧毁它来阻止一群人的到来。

194
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:12,515
他在爆炸中被抓住了。

195
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:18,921
我错在不信任你。

196
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,457
我对你失去了信心。
It was losing my faith in you.

197
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:26,296
你能原谅我吗？
Can you forgive me for that?

198
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:33,069
那些不能原谅你的人怎么办？
What about all the people who can't forgive you?

199
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:37,073
你弄走的那些呢？
What about the ones you made gone?

200
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:40,443
你怎么能忍受？
How do you live with that?

201
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,312
礼拜.
Prayer.

I can't talk about the things I've been a part of,

205
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:00,930
我将成为其中的一部分
things I will be a part of.

206
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,964
连你的人都不知道？
Not even to your people?

207
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:04,200
号
No.

208
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,371
不告诉他们你们的事。
Not without telling them about all of you.

209
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:11,974
你可以跟我说

210
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:15,211
神职人员保密。

00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,347
你当时都不在这儿安妮
You weren't even here, Anne.

212
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,851
我原谅你了

214
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,133
把他绑在床上，然后你自己。

215

坐下吧

00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,547
坐下吧
Sit down.

217
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:10,032
你觉得她是一个人？

218
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,202
她一个人，我打赌没人知道她在这儿。
She's alone, and I bet nobody know's she's here.

219
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:14,737
太没礼貌了
That's just rude.

220
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:23,045
你觉得她是怎么找到我们的？

221
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,880
我就跳进去。

00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:34,123
所以我回到了回收队

225
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:35,725
然后我看到了残骸。

感觉像是一个深刻的时刻。

奇怪的是，你的大脑会在那样的瞬间记住这些东西。
Strange, the things your brain remembers in a moment like that.

228
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:49,405
臭氧的味道，直升机地板上的蜘蛛，
The smell of ozone, a spider on the floor of a helicopter,

229
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:52,808
一辆黄色卡车停在那里

230
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,545
我有种唠叨的感觉。

我坚持要回去，
I insisted on going back,

232
00:18:57,112 --> 00:18:58,981
但我不会让任何人离开峰会
but I wouldn't pull anyone away from the Summit.

233
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:00,483
太重要了

234
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,385
飞到最近的跳跃点，补给，
Flew myself to the nearest jump point, supplied up,

235
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,255
在那里借了急救车。

236
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:09,359
我回来的时候你的坠机地点是一片废墟。

我看到你留下了面包屑。

238
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:14,997
死三角洲。拉面包装纸？

239
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,566
一路沿着90号高速公路行驶。

去弗吉尼亚最直接的路线。

没人知道她在这儿毫米

242
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:24,640
她错过了机会。

243
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,009
早该在我们睡觉的时候杀了我们。

我一直在想我杀的另一个人

作为一个能帮助改变世界的人

我们之间的事我没说。

在杀了你们之前我不想这么做。
I didn't want to do that before I killed both of you.

250
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:51,133
你只是在玩游戏，安妮。

251
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,603
你根本不在乎军队和城市。

253
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:58,474
你觉得我还是她。我不是。

我也不是那个堆里的女人。

我们拿走。我们不麻烦。没用
We take. We don't bother. Didn't work.

260
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,861
如果我让你回家，

261
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,696
其他一些有进取心的准尉

是为了找到你我的联系

263
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,467
与亚历山大的关系会被发现

264
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:28,037
而这项重要的工作将结束。

265
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:30,005
我救了你的命。

266
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:31,374
你拿走了

268
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,546
你从我们的孩子那里夺走了

这些年他们在没有父亲的情况下长大。

这么多年来我都不知道他是死是活。
All those years I didn't know if he was alive or dead.

271
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:44,420
你偷走了我们的家庭安妮

272
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,557
我没在你睡觉的时候杀你是因为我想...

我得谢谢你。

275
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:56,566
你的孩子会有一个更好的世界

276
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,336
你可以做其他选择，

277

你的故事到此为止。

让它成为你的和平。

瑞克！我们得走了！

瑞克的妻子怎么样了

284
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,399
米琼恩？

285
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,101
她不在，帮助别人。
She's away, helping people.

286
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,139
你为什么叫她妻子？

287
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,542
她不是吗？
I mean, wasn't she?

288
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:43,546
不是正式的但是
Well, not officially, but--

289
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:46,649
如果那还重要的话。
If that matters anymore.

290
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:48,718
有趣的是
It's funny.

291
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:52,955
有一天，瑞克说我应该嫁给他们。
One day, Rick said that I should marry them.

292
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:54,890
也许我们应该在桥上做
Maybe we should do it right there on the bridge

293
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,892
我们正在建造的
that we were building.

294
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,429
但我看不到他描述的未来，
But I couldn't see the future he described,

295
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:04,434
所以我坐在森林里的一根木头上
so I sat on a log in the forest,

296
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:07,236
在我脚下的泥土里
and there at my feet, in the dirt,

297
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:11,306
就在我面前，是一枚戒指
right in front of me, was a ring.

298
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:15,177
看起来像是一个漂亮的结婚戒指，
It seemed like it'd make a pretty nice wedding ring,

299
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:18,914
所以我把它留了下来，我想把它放在什么地方
so I kept it, and I thought to put it someplace

300
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,315
瑞克在哪里找到的
where Rick would find it

301
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:23,819
因为我突然想到"有一天"
because I could suddenly see that "someday".

302
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,162
但发生的事已经发生了。
But what happened happened.

303
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:36,932
去年我一直在
Well, I have spent the last year

304
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:40,035
期待着我们的下一次访问。
looking forward to our next visit.

305
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:44,373
只是坐在这里聊天。
Just sitting here and talking.

306
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:50,379
几乎让我感觉到它是怎样的，我是谁。
Almost makes me feel like how it was, like who I was.

307
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:55,117
在那之前的364天里，
The other 364 days back there,

308
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:56,986
与其说是个人关系
it's less about personal connection

309
00:22:56,986 --> 00:23:01,724
更多关于责任
and more about responsibility

310
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:04,359
比我更伟大的东西
to something greater than myself.

311
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,467
即使这意味着我必须
Even if that means I have to do

312
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,703
困难的事情。
things that are difficult.

313
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:20,810
甚至残忍。
Even cruel.

314
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:25,414
如果你是来表示怀疑的，
If you're here expressing doubts,

315
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:28,818
那这不就说明你不是那种人吗
then isn't that a sign that that isn't who you are?

316
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:32,387
知道自己做错了就意味着
Knowing you're doing wrong, it means that--

317
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:34,624
是为了生存。
It's about survival.

318
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,428
而是关于接下来的事情。
It's about what comes after.

319
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:41,463
其他人的生存。
Survival of others.

320
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,900
我的那一部分
And that part of me

321
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,671
它让我活了下来
that I've harnessed, it has kept me alive,

322
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:54,744
也许它还能让世界其他地方都活下去
and maybe it can keep the rest of the world alive, too.

323
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,449
和我们发生冲突的那个组织
The group we were in conflict with--

324
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:03,218
他们破坏了我们的城墙
they compromised our walls.

325
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,087
食物稀缺。
Food is scarce.

326
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:06,922
孩子们饿了。
Children are hungry.

327
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:13,428
也许你和你的人可以帮忙？
Maybe you and your people could help?

328
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,231
不会有太多。
It wouldn't have to be much.

329
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:17,733
我们一拿到钱就还给你
We'd repay you as soon as we got--

330
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:20,269
加布里埃尔，你知道我做不到
Gabriel, you know that I can't.

331
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:25,174
我都不在这儿
I'm not even here.

332
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:29,444
请知道我的悔恨是真的。
Please know that my remorse is real.

333
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:32,281
就像你在做残酷而艰难的事情。
As you do cruel and difficult things.

334
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,083
是啊我该走了
Yeah. I should go.

335
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,586
等等不好意思
Wait. I'm sorry.

336
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:38,353
求你了
Please.

337
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,359
带上这个
Take this with you.

338
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:50,499
你一直在质疑。
You've been questioning things.

339
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:53,936
这是信仰的象征。
This is a symbol of faith.

340
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:55,470
爱的
Of love.

341
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,773
也许它能给你一些你需要的东西。
Maybe it'll give you something you need.

342
00:24:57,773 --> 00:25:00,976
把它给你就是给了我需要的东西。
Giving it to you is giving me something that I need.

343
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,850
明年？
Next year?

344
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,853
同一天，同一地点？
Same day, same place?

345
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:12,655
如果我还活着。
If I'm alive.

346
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:27,837
走，走，走。
Go, go, go.

347
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:31,807
我们不能杀她。哦，我们可以。
We can't kill her. Oh, we can.

348
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:34,443
我告诉过你，她留了一份关于家里的文件让客户管理部门找到。
I told you, she left a file about home for the CRM to find.

349
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:36,311
为了摧毁亚历山大，
To destroy Alexandria,

350
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:38,047
因为她就是这样的瑞克
because that's what she does, Rick!

351
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:39,348
她毁了！
She destroys!

352
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:41,717
她剥夺了我们的机会
She robbed us of you being there

353
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:44,353
看到你的儿子出生，迈出他的第一步
to see your son being born, taking his first step.

354
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:47,990
好吧，她死后我们该怎么办？
Okay, what do we do after she's dead?

355
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,660
不管我们要做什么。
Whatever we have to do.

356
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,361
等等
Hold on.

357
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,033
妈的！
Shit!

358
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,774
啊！
Ah!

359
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:21,056
你看到那东西了吗
Do you see that drop-off?

360
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,624
是的
Yep.

361
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:25,895
操！
Fuck!

362
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:37,506
有人来了
We got company.

363
00:26:37,506 --> 00:26:39,574
数三下一二三
On three. One, two, three!

364
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:53,689
从哪条路到跳跃点？
Which way to that jump point?

365
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:56,591
你以为我会在乎羚羊的屁股
You think that I give an antelope's ass

366
00:26:56,591 --> 00:26:59,428
关于拉面的事
about some ramen?!

367
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:00,629
只是意大利面。
That's just pasta.

368
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,765
我他妈的在乎意大利面？
The hell I care about pasta?

369
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:05,067
你好
Hel-- Hello.

370
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:08,103
太好了
Good goddamn.

371
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:10,539
你看起来像一堆河马屎，妹妹。
You look like a pile of hippo shit, sister.

372
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,641
我不是来伤害任何人的。
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

373
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,744
我只是需要点帮助。
I just need a little help.

374
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:16,245
求你了
Please.

375
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:19,548
我被一些非常危险的人追杀，
I'm being pursued by some very dangerous people,

376
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:22,584
我只是需要点帮助
and I just need a little help.

377
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,888
我的社区是安全的。它有墙和食物，
My community is safe. And it has walls and food,

378
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:30,926
我可以给你一个地方
and I can offer you a place that is you just--

379
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:34,296
如果你带我去个地方的话
if you just get me somewhere, you know?

380
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,597
不太远
It's not far.

381
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:39,668
是啊，好吧，"不远"是多远？
Yeah, well, how far is "not far"?

382
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:41,703
只有几英里。
It's just a few miles.

383
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,311
什么？
What?

384
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:52,147
你很高。
You're tall.

385
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:56,685
这些基地在全国各地互相隔开。
The bases are across the country from each other.

386
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,520
我们得知道她藏在哪一个。
We need to know which one she hid it in.

387
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,823
如果我们能活捉她和她谈谈
If we can take her alive, talk to her--

388
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:02,591
你听说她讨厌别人叫她安妮。
You heard her hate being called Anne.

389
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:04,626
我觉得她还在里面的某个地方。
I think she's still in there somewhere.

390
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:06,295
如果她能先告诉我们什么，
And if there's something she can give us first,

391
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:08,297
能保护亚历山大安全的东西
something to help keep Alexandria safe--

392
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:10,165
我们会保护它的。
We'll keep it safe.

393
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:11,767
但她会死的。
But she's gonna die.

394
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,803
我们要保证它的安全，不要冒任何风险。
We need to keep it safe without risking anything.

395
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,370
我看不见一些东西。
I couldn't see some things.

396
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,872
我做不到你帮了我
I couldn't. You helped me.

397
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:19,541
也许我们能帮她，如果我们不能...
Maybe we can help her, and if we can't...

398
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:20,876
我就能杀了她？
Then I can kill her?

399
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:22,444
随便你
Be my guest.

400
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,446
先致残吧。
Maybe just maim first.

401
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:26,548
你看到了吗？
You see this?

402
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,068
是啊
Yeah.

403
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:51,867
是你啊不好意思
It's you. I'm sorry.

404
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:54,269
她答应带我们一起去。
She promised she's take us with her.

405
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:56,438
我们所做的就是把你引进来。
All we do was lure you in here.

406
00:29:56,438 --> 00:29:59,208
我们不像你。我们一个人是活不过来的。
We're not like you. We wouldn't have made it on our own.

407
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,243
四对二。
That's four on two.

408
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:02,777
人是资源。
People are a resource.

409
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:04,646
不管她说了什么，都不是你想的那样。
Whatever she said, it's not what you think it is.

410
00:30:04,646 --> 00:30:08,450
只要我能吃顿饭穿条新裤子，我就没事了。
So long as I got a meal and a new pair of pants, I'm good.

411
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,985
我们还有时间把它卷回去。
There's still time to roll this back.

412
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:11,386
不，没有。
No, there's ain't.

413
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:13,255
再见瑞克
Goodbye, Rick.

414
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,793
红色！
Red!

415
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:42,117
我还以为你这次不会来了呢。
I half thought you wouldn't show up this time.

416
00:30:42,117 --> 00:30:46,188
我拒绝了你，我不会怪你的。
After what I denied you, I wouldn't have blamed you.

417
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:52,794
我...
I was...

418
00:30:52,794 --> 00:30:54,496
点整打
sharp.

419
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:58,267
我也不假装明白
And I don't pretend to understand

420
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:03,272
你的社区或你对他们的承诺。
your community or your commitment to them.

421
00:31:03,272 --> 00:31:05,474
但我确实知道你的那一部分
But I do know something about that part of yourself

422
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:07,542
你害怕失去的东西
that you're scared of losing.

423
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,544
如果它已经消失了呢？
What if it's already gone?

424
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:16,451
每年，我回到这里，我都做了更糟糕的事情。
Every year, I come back here, I've done worse things.

425
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,987
我知道他们为什么会结束。
I know why they're done.

426
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:20,189
我相信我们的努力。
I believe in what we're trying to do.

427
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:24,893
但有计划和"为什么"。
But there's the Plan and the "why".

428
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,164
还有血迹
And then there's the blood.

429
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:34,736
我知道你觉得不能告诉我。
I know you feel you can't tell me.

430
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:37,039
不过你可以卡
But you can.

431
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,540
我来了
I'm here.

432
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,575
我不能我
I can't.

433
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:45,580
如果我做不到，我就不在这儿。
And if I can't, I'm not here.

434
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,382
号
No.

435
00:31:47,382 --> 00:31:50,485
你是的
You are.

436
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:52,721
我能向你倾诉吗？
Can I confide in you?

437
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:54,056
当然了
Of course.

438
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:56,891
我期待着这些日子，
I look forward to these days,

439
00:31:56,891 --> 00:32:02,764
拥有这一切，拥有你
to have this, to have you to myself.

440
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,335
这个秘密。
This secret.

441
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:08,170
这些天
These days.

442
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,072
我有你，
I have you,

443
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:13,508
这就证明了你还在这里安妮
and that proves that you're still here, Anne.

444
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,277
就是这样。
It just does.

445
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,559
为什么你不跟我回亚历山大？
Why don't you come with me back to Alexandria?

446
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,094
的加百列
Gabriel.

447
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:33,695
没有人需要知道你的社区，
Nobody needs to know about your community,

448
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:36,531
任何事我不能我
about anything. I can't.

449
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:38,533
因为我已经告诉过你的所有原因。
For all the reasons that I've already told you.

450
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:39,934
就是这样。
That's just it.

451
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,636
你还没有告诉我任何关于你的组织的事情，
You haven't told me anything about your group,

452
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:43,805
除此之外，他们都是囤积物资的人
other than that they're people who horde supplies

453
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:47,476
而另一些人却在挨饿。
while others starve.

454
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,544
你认为我们这么做的目的
You think that the purpose of what we do

455
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:51,480
就是让人们受苦？
is to make people suffer?

456
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:56,918
我会成为这样一个团体的一员吗？
That I'd be part of a group like that?

457
00:32:56,918 --> 00:32:58,253
你就是这么看我的吗？
Is that what you think of me?

458
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:00,822
不是的。我知道你不是他们。
No. I know you're not them.

459
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:03,558
当我看着你的眼睛时，我看到了。
I see it when I look in your eyes.

460
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:05,827
这是我干的。
I did this.

461
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:07,162
这就是我。
This was me.

462
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,730
什么？
What?

463
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,798
我很抱歉我来这里。
I'm sorry I came here.

464
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,968
我很抱歉我让自己变得脆弱。
I'm sorry I made myself vulnerable.

465
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:16,571
我很抱歉把你变成了无理取闹的对象。
I'm sorry for turning you into a loose end.

466
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:18,807
什么？
What?

467
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:27,116
对不起。
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:29,618
不如你现身吧？
How about you show yourself?

469
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:30,785
我们谈过了？
We talk?

470
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:32,187
你的意思是“让我开口”，对吗？
You mean "get me to talk", right?

471
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:35,357
伏击我，一个接一个地打断我所有的骨头
Ambush me, break all my bones one by one

472
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:38,627
直到我把我藏在亚历山大港的文件泄漏出来？
'til I spill where I hid my file on Alexandria?

473
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:40,262
不可能的，瑞克。
Not gonna happen, Rick.

474
00:33:40,262 --> 00:33:44,199
我为事业而生，我将为事业而死。
I live for the cause, and I will die for the cause.

475
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,301
我不是叛徒。
I'm not a traitor.

476
00:33:46,301 --> 00:33:48,170
不像你。
Not like you.

477
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,841
你还好吗？嗯。
You okay? Yeah.

478
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:54,509
差一点。
That was close.

479
00:33:57,312 --> 00:34:01,049
你们两个在一起--你们势不可挡。
You two together-- you are unstoppable.

480
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,220
但这救不了你的孩子。
But that won't save your kids.

481
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,290
你杀了我，他们就死定了。
You kill me, they're dead.

482
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:12,861
我因伤而死，他们也死了。
I die from my wounds, they're dead.

483
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,904
我被行尸杀了，他们死定了。
I get killed by walkers, they're dead.

484
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:25,073
米琼恩。
Michonne.

485
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,589
米琼恩！
Michonne!

486
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:44,593
他妈的!
Shit!

487
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:55,170
事情本不该是这样的。
It didn't have to be this way.

488
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,239
你在路上，瑞克。
You were on the path, Rick.

489
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,674
这么多年过去了，你终于感觉到
After all these years, you were finally feeling

490
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:03,712
为比你自己更伟大的东西而战的责任。
the responsibility to fight for something bigger than yourself.

491
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:05,614
比尔也看到了。
And Beale saw it, too.

492
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:07,882
他本来要给你做梯队简报
He was gonna give you the Echelon Briefing

493
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:10,352
你回来的那一刻。
the moment you returned.

494
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:14,856
你的眼睛就会睁开，看到真实的大小和范围
Your eyes would have been opened to the true size and scope

495
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:19,261
客户关系管理公司将如何把这个世界带回来。
of what the CRM is gonna do to bring this world back.

496
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:23,097
你本可以确保亚历山大港的安全。
You could have ensured Alexandria's security.

497
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:25,400
但你没有。
But you didn't.

498
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,537
你让米琼恩把你从那里拉了出来。
You let Michonne pull you away from that.

499
00:35:28,537 --> 00:35:33,208
你所要做的就是在瑞克安排你逃跑的时候离开。
All you had to do was leave when Rick arranged for your escape.

500
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,876
但你没有。
But you didn't.

501
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:38,613
现在，我们在这里，还有你朋友的命运，
And now, here we are, and the fates of your friends,

502
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:44,118
你的孩子们，因为你和她一样而被封存。
your children, sealed because you are just like her.

503
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:46,321
“你要照顾好你自己。”
"You look out for you."

504
00:35:47,756 --> 00:35:52,126
你不会真的想把家里的人都杀了吧，安妮。
You don't really want to kill everyone back home, Anne.

505
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,262
我知道你不知道。
I know you don't.

506
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:55,230
这不是“想要”的问题。
It's not about "want".

507
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:00,168
是为了保存人性还是拯救人性，
It's about keeping your humanity or saving humanity,

508
00:36:00,168 --> 00:36:02,437
这是一种选择
and it is a choice.

509
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:05,073
我选择了我的社区。
I've chosen my community.

510
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,342
我选择了我的生活。
I've chosen my life.

511
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:10,645
今天谁会死？
So, who's gonna die today?

512
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:12,247
你们两个？
The two of you?

513
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:16,318
还是我和家里的人？
Or me and everyone back home?

514
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,426
她说得对
She's right.

515
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:26,194
瑞克
Rick.

516
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,667
我不想看。
I didn't want to see it.

517
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:38,106
我想让她死，这样我就不用看到了。
I wanted her dead so I didn't have to see it.

518
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:41,543
但是瑞克，必须有牺牲
But, Rick, there has to be a sacrifice.

519
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:46,548
自从我找到你，我所做的一切都是为了我们。
Since I found you, all that I've done has been for us.

520
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:53,288
但现在我知道我们不能以回家告终。
But now I see this can't end with us going home.

521
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:57,559
好吧，你会怎么样？
Well, what's it gonna be?

522
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,196
好吧
Okay.

523
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,401
我们还有个交易要做，
There's still a deal to be made,

524
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:11,306
一个我们都能生活的地方还有亚历山大
one where we all can live and Alexandria.

525
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:13,975
米琼恩得到了一些补给品让你撑到足够长的时间
Michonne gets some supplies to keep you long enough

526
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:18,580
带你到跳跃点我就跟你回去
to get you to the jump point, and I'll go back with you.

527
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,083
我们会说我在车祸中受伤，是唯一的幸存者，
We'll say I was injured in the crash, the lone survivor,

528
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:26,488
我会回到CRM，为未来而努力
and I'll go back to the CRM, to working for a future,

529
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:30,592
好像这一切都没发生过，但有一个条件
like none of this ever happened, on one condition.

530
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:34,529
米琼恩逃走了我从没告诉他们亚历山大的事
Michonne gets away and I never tell them about Alexandria.

531
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,666
这是唯一可行的方法。
It's the only way this works.

532
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,434
成交？
We got a deal?

533
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:45,273
我为什么要相信你，
Why should I trust you,

534
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:48,343
在你做了那么多蠢事之后
after all the shit that you've pulled?

535
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:50,612
我们成交还是不成交？
We got a deal or not?

536
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,248
是啊
Yeah.

537
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:57,619
我们成交了
We got a deal.

538
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,911
靠近点瑞克
Come closer, Rick.

539
00:38:22,911 --> 00:38:24,813
快出来
Show yourself.

540
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:32,787
我们放下了武器。放下你的。
We laid down our weapons. Lay down yours.

541
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:54,509
你看起来好多了。
You've looked better.

542
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,652
我真傻，以为我能带你
I was a fool to think I could take you

543
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:06,287
你们两个在一起
down with you two together,

544
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:10,091
所以我才同意了你的交易
which is why I agreed to your deal.

545
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,327
她拿医药箱。
Her getting the med kit.

546
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:22,937
我也不信任你，但我尊重你，瑞克。
I don't trust you, either, but I respect you, Rick.

547
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:27,609
你在自欺欺人。
You're lying to yourself.

548
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:29,611
你一直在欺骗自己。
You keep lying to yourself.

549
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:30,779
你不能老回来。
You don't keep coming back here.

550
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,781
你从未离开过。
You never left.

551
00:39:32,781 --> 00:39:34,483
你错了
You're wrong.

552
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:35,884
我不是...
I'm not--

553
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:38,887
去吧
Go ahead.

554
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,324
开枪吧
Shoot me.

555
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:46,194
让我明白让我看看你是谁。
Make me understand. Show me who you are.

556
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,032
放下
Drop it.

557
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:58,306
我说了放下枪。
I said drop it.

558
00:39:58,306 --> 00:40:01,910
在我出卖你之前你出卖了我。
You double-crossed me before I double-crossed you.

559
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,845
这是个好计划
That's a good plan.

560
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:07,215
把枪放下，否则我杀了你。
Drop the gun, or I will kill you.

561
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:11,586
即使这意味着亚历山大已经被摧毁了？
Even if it means that Alexandria is destroyed?

562
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:48,089
我曾经拥有或失去的一切。
Everything I've ever had or lost.

563
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:54,195
我的人民，我的朋友，所有人。
My people, my friends, everyone.

564
00:40:58,232 --> 00:41:02,503
我厌倦了失败。
I was tired of losing.

565
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:06,641
我终于成为了可以持久的一部分。
I was finally part of something that could last.

566
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:11,045
我不能失去另一个社区。
And I couldn't lose another community.

567
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,882
我以前的那个。
My old one.

568
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:17,719
还有我的新朋友
And my new one.

569
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:22,090
我知道如果我不杀了你们，
I knew if I didn't kill you all,

570
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:26,127
不知何故，你会来找客户关系管理部
somehow, some way, you'd come for the CRM.

571
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:33,902
所以，我起草了档案来保护自己
So, I drew up the dossier to protect myself

572
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:36,971
确保你不能
and make sure you couldn't.

573
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:39,774
我以为，在我死后，这是值得的。
I thought, in my death, it was worth it.

574
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:42,611
我选择了一个阵营，对吧？
I'd chosen a side, right?

575
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,345
我以为我有。
I thought I had.

576
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:49,017
来回。
Back and forth.

577
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:51,352
杰迪斯
Jadis,

578
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:53,021
安妮，
Anne,

579
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:56,490
亚历山大人，
Alexandrians,

580
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,693
CRM.
CRM.

581
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,210
走了
Go.

582
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:24,886
你来找我是为了帮你找到答案。
You came to me to help you find an answer.

583
00:42:24,886 --> 00:42:27,956
你刚找到的。
You just found it.

584
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:29,891
明年见，安妮。
I'll see you next year, Anne.

585
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:36,030
他已经给我看过了。
He already showed me.

586
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:43,204
我找到了答案。
I found my answer.

587
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:54,816
档案在我在卡斯卡迪亚基地的房间里
The dossier-- it's in my room at the Cascadia Base.

588
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:57,752
毁掉它然后回家。
Just destroy it and go home.

589
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:04,392
CRM将让世界回归。
The CRM will bring the world back.

590
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:06,761
告诉我你不会去找他们。
Tell me you won't come after them.

591
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:09,698
号
No.

592
00:43:09,698 --> 00:43:12,000
因为我们是来找他们的。
Because we are coming for them.

593
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,268
我们会拿到档案的。
We're gonna get the dossier.

594
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:27,682
然后是CRM
And then the CRM--

595
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:30,451
我们会阻止他们
we're gonna stop them.

596
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:35,089
他会得到阶梯简报
He's gonna get the Echelon Briefing

597
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:37,525
找出他们所做的一切
and find out everything that they do

598
00:43:37,525 --> 00:43:40,261
市政府不知道的事情
that the city doesn't know about.

599
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:44,032
我看到的城市无法忍受他们的存在，
The city I saw won't stand for what they are,

600
00:43:44,032 --> 00:43:46,567
我们会帮助市政府阻止他们
and we're gonna help the city stop them,

601
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:52,140
因为安妮
because, Anne,

602
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,644
CRM不是答案，
the CRM is not the answer,

603
00:43:56,644 --> 00:43:59,714
他们必须结束
and they must end.

604
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,155
我们会这么做的
We're gonna do that.

605
00:44:11,325 --> 00:44:14,295
你让我们活着是有原因的。
You kept us alive for a reason.

606
00:44:17,832 --> 00:44:19,500
毫米
Mm.

607
00:44:22,136 --> 00:44:25,073
我真希望我死的时候是个艺术家。
I wish I'd died an artist.

608
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:32,580
在那种生活中，从来都不是为了生存。
It was never about survival in that life.

609
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:36,517
只是关于真相。
It was just about truth.

610
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:42,023
这是我的
And this is mine.

611
00:44:42,023 --> 00:44:44,492
我故事的结尾。
The end of my story.

612
00:44:47,328 --> 00:44:49,530
我的安宁。
My peace.

613

*

614
00:45:01,876 --> 00:45:08,716
在桥上你告诉加布里埃尔你想娶她
On the bridge, you told Gabriel you wanted to marry her.

615
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:14,789
他发现了这个，他想把它给你。
He found this, and he wanted to give it to you.

616
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:17,691
你怎么...
How did you--

617
00:45:20,228 --> 00:45:23,031
你不是在做梦，瑞克。
You weren't dreaming, Rick.

618
00:45:23,031 --> 00:45:25,066
去吧
Go ahead.

619
00:45:27,335 --> 00:45:29,703
做你说的你会做的。
Do what you said you would do.

620
00:45:31,873 --> 00:45:33,641
求你了
Please.

跳跃点就在山脊那边。
The jump point's just over that ridge.

625
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:33,067
你之前在她面前对我说的话
What you said to me before, in front of her--

626
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:35,236
不仅仅是为了她
it wasn't just for her.

627
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:37,872
你一个人不可能改变他们，瑞克，
You couldn't have changed them by yourself, Rick,

628
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:39,240
但一起呢
but together?

629
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,075
整个世界
The whole damn world--

630
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:44,578
我知道我们该怎么做，
I see how we could make it better,

631
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:46,480
如果可以的话
and if we can,

632
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,483
瑞克，我们必须这样做。
Rick, we have to.

633
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:52,053
米琼恩等等
Michonne, wait.

634
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:54,288
我一直想说点什么。
I've been wanting to say something.

635
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:05,399
这是个破碎的世界米琼恩
It's a broken world, Michonne,

636
00:47:05,399 --> 00:47:09,837
而你是唯一能让一切恢复正常的人
and you're the only thing that puts it back together.

637
00:47:11,805 --> 00:47:14,842
直到我最后一口气，我是你的。

00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:33,361
但那只可能是你。
But it could only ever have been you.

我们进去，你得到简报
We go in, you get the briefing

651
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:56,177
拿到她留下的档案
and get the dossier she left behind,

652
00:48:56,377 --> 00:48:57,845
然后一起回家

就是这里
This is it.

下一刻，一切都会改变。
After this next moment, everything will change.

我们疯了吗？
Are we crazy?

658

第五集，
Episode five,

662
00:49:30,278 --> 00:49:32,012
这是一种倒退，有点
it's a throwback, a little bit,

663
00:49:32,146 --> 00:49:35,049
我们在《行尸走肉》中的一集”
to an episode that we had during "The Walking Dead."

664
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:36,617
就像蜜月一样。
It's like a honeymoon.

665
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,852
一个末日般的蜜月，但蜜月。
An apocalyptic honeymoon, but a honeymoon.

666
00:49:38,986 --> 00:49:41,455
有一种甜蜜，他们是如此的团结
There's a sweetness to it, and they're so together

667
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:43,291
一切都会好起来的
and everything's going to be fine,

668
00:49:43,424 --> 00:49:46,894
但显然世界仍在为他们而来
but obviously the world is still coming for them.

669
00:49:46,994 --> 00:49:51,799
的加百列没事的我一个人
Gabriel. It's okay. I'm alone.

670
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:54,235
没事吧？
Is it okay?

671
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:56,804
即使你一个人？
Even if you are alone?

672
00:49:56,804 --> 00:49:58,206
这是我们之前
This is something that we were kicking around

673
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:00,741
在作家的房间里。
a little bit in the writers' room.

674
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:02,710
饰Father Gabriel
The character of Father Gabriel

675
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:09,016
确实揭开了我们从未见过的关于杰迪斯的东西
really did open up things about Jadis that we hadn't seen.

676
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:13,554
事实上，真的，就像安妮在扮演那个角色之前一样。
And in fact, really, as Anne before she took on that persona.

677
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:15,689
我觉得从很多方面来说，杰迪斯都在努力
I think in many ways, Jadis is trying

678
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:18,692
当杰迪斯·斯托克斯准尉真的很难
really, really hard to be Warrant Officer Jadis Stokes,

679
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:21,695
他在为
who is working for the cause

680
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:24,565
她会不惜一切代价完成她的工作
and will stop at nothing to get her job done

681
00:50:24,698 --> 00:50:27,168
因为她想念她的另一部分
because there is this other part of her that she misses,

682
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:28,502
她的另一部分
and there is this other part of her

683
00:50:28,636 --> 00:50:32,706
对死亡感到内疚
that feels guilt for the deaths

684
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,743
而且她保守着这个巨大的秘密
and for the fact that she's keeping this massive secret--

685
00:50:35,843 --> 00:50:37,545
她知道里克在哪
that she knows where Rick is.

686
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:39,880
你这么做是为了你自己安妮
You're doing this for you, Anne.

687
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,416
不，为了共和国。
No, for the Republic.

688
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,084
小屋里的东西，
The stuff that goes down in the cabin,

689
00:50:44,218 --> 00:50:48,088
我认为，这是告诉杰迪斯是矛盾的。
I think, is the tell that Jadis is conflicted.

690
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:51,592
在某种程度上，她无法做出选择。
In some way, she couldn't make a choice.

691
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:54,862
她不想失去CRM。
She doesn't want to lose the CRM.

692
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:56,297
她不想失去亚历山大
She doesn't want to lose Alexandria

693
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:59,032
就像她失去了自己人一样
the way that she lost her own people.

694
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:01,101
本来不必这样的。
It didn't have to be this way.

695
00:51:01,235 --> 00:51:02,703
这么多年过去了，
After all these years,

696
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:04,705
你终于感觉到了
you were finally feeling the responsibility

697
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:07,241
为比你更重要的东西而战
to fight for something bigger than yourself.

698
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:09,277
比尔也看到了
And Beale saw it, too.

699
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,912
在杰迪斯看来他太自私了
In Jadis' mind, it's extremely selfish of him

700
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:15,449
试图阻止这样一个伟大的计划
to try and get in the way of such a greater plan

701
00:51:15,549 --> 00:51:17,485
为了所有人，永远
for everybody, forever,

702
00:51:17,585 --> 00:51:19,753
超越宇宙中的这个小光点
beyond this little blip in the universe

703
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:21,155
我们生活的地方
in which we're living.

704
00:51:21,255 --> 00:51:23,991
所以，她不想杀他，
So, she doesn't want to kill him,

705
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:26,760
但如果她不得不这么做，她必须这么做
but if she has to, she has to.

706
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,763
对杰迪斯来说，
It's central to Jadis to be thinking grandiosely

707
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:32,900
但她没说谎
about the entire world, but she isn't lying.

708
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:34,968
她认为这是工作方式。
She thinks this is the way it works.

709
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:39,407
档案在我房间里
The dossier-- it's in my room.

710
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,310
你只要毁了它然后回家。
You just destroy it and go home.

711
00:51:42,443 --> 00:51:45,279
最后，在告诉他们档案的事时，
In the end, in telling them about the dossier,

712
00:51:45,379 --> 00:51:47,181
她选择了安妮
she chose Anne,

713
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:49,082
加布里埃尔一直这么说
which is kind of what Gabriel was saying all along.

714
00:51:49,082 --> 00:51:51,185
我觉得杰迪斯的死
I think Jadis' death is a very

715
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,120
《行尸走肉》是典型的死亡方式
"Walking Dead" classic kind of death.

716
00:51:53,254 --> 00:51:55,256
有情感，
There's emotion,

717
00:51:55,256 --> 00:51:57,925
有很多矛盾的选择
there's conflicted choices that have been made,

718
00:51:58,058 --> 00:51:59,693
瑞克必须为她结束一切
and Rick has to end things for her.

719
00:51:59,793 --> 00:52:01,362
只是让事情变得更加复杂。
It just makes it that much more complex.

720
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:03,964
做你说的你会做的。
Do what you said you would do.

721
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:05,266
求你了
Please.

722
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:14,842

723
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:16,477
以我作为演员的经验，
In my experience as an actor,

724
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,947
我总是随身携带角色。
I've always carried characters on with me.

725
00:52:19,947 --> 00:52:22,983
我希望我能保持她的优雅和安静
I hope I hold on to her groundedness and her quiet

726
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,986
还有她毫不掩饰的自我意识，尽管听起来很奇怪，
and her unabashed sense of self, as odd as that might sound,

727
00:52:26,086 --> 00:52:28,289
因为她是很多人
because she has been many people.

728
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:30,491
她是一个非常接地气的角色，
She's a very grounding character to play,

729
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,626
而我就像只多动症的小狗
and I'm like a hyperactive puppy,

730
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:35,195
所以她对我很好
so she's been really good for me for that.

731
00:52:35,296 --> 00:52:38,165
这个粉丝们重新看了
And, um, this fandom rewatches,

732
00:52:38,299 --> 00:52:40,868
这个粉丝从各个角度来找你
and this fandom comes to you from all angles.

733
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:43,671
所以我觉得我可能会说杰迪斯
And so, I feel like I'll probably be talking about Jadis

734
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:45,339
我的余生都在街上和人在一起
in the street with people for the rest of my life,

735
00:52:45,473 --> 00:52:46,907
我也希望如此
and I hope so.

736
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:48,809
米琼恩等等
Michonne, wait.

737
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:50,644
我一直想说点什么。
I've been wanting to say something.

738
00:52:50,644 --> 00:52:54,147
求婚是由达奈推动的
The marriage proposal was driven by Danai

739
00:52:54,147 --> 00:52:57,518
把他们联系得更紧密
as a story idea to bind them even closer.

740
00:52:57,618 --> 00:53:01,154
那是他们最后的时刻
That's their last moment they get to have in that way

741
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:03,090
在一切混乱之前
before all hell breaks loose.

742
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:09,096
