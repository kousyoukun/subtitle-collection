262
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:38,377
是它吗
Is that it?

263
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:39,844
不是
No.

264
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,222
在那里
Oh, there it is!

265
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:42,288
不是
No.

266
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:44,733
在那里
There it is!

267
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:47,066
也不是
No.

268
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,711
今天可能是我人生中最酷的一天
This may be the coolest day of my life.

269
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,644
你现在看到的是
You're looking at the grand prize winner

270
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,911
史蒂夫牌芥末
of the Steve's Mustard

271
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,911
"赢得豪华轿车一天"竞赛的大奖得主
"Win a Limo for a Day" Contest.

272
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,800
我不得不吃掉了和我体重一样多的芥末酱
I had to eat my weight in mustard.

273
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,311
但我最终还是找到了有奖的那一罐
But I finally found the winning jar.

274
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,733
它来了它来了它来了
Here it is! Here it is! Here it is!

275
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:05,644
先生  早上好
Good morning, sir.

276
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,222
我是柯比  你今天的专属司机
I'm Kirby, your personal chauffeur for the day.

277
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,777
躲猫猫
Peek-a-boo!

278
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,533
躲猫猫
Peek-a-boo!

279
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,488
这辆豪华轿车有超酷的芥末酱收藏
This limo has a fancy mustard collection!

280
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,400
我们去接我的队员吧  我们去商场吧
Let's go pick up my team. Let's go to the mall.

281
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,422
我知道有一个送葬仪式我们可以去参加
I know a funeral procession we can ride in.

282
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,355
大伙们  我知道你们对这辆林肯豪华轿车都很激动
Guys, guys, I know you're all excited about Lincoln's limo.

283
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,688
但我们先让他享受一会吧
But let's let him enjoy it for awhile first,

284
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,444
然后他会回来带我们去兜风
then he'll come back and take us for a ride.

285
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,044
对吧  小林肯  当然啦
Right, Linky? Sure.

286
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,022
我五点来接你们怎么样
How about I pick you all up at 5:00 o'clock

287
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,555
然后我们可以一起去打嗝汉堡店
and we can all go down to the Burpin' Burger?

288
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,822
耶
Yay!

289
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,933
你们都饿了吧  别观望了
Hungry, y'all? Look no further.

290
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,711
快来打嗝汉堡店
Come on down to Burpin' Burger

291
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,644
二级牛肉还有特殊调料
Grade B beef and special spice

292
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,466
翻过来吃味道更好
When it comes back up it's twice as nice

293
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,511
先生  您的高端出行体验现在开始
Your premium transportation experience begins now, sir.

294
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:11,177
为什么要叫我先生  叫我林肯
What's all this "Sir" Stuff? Call me Lincoln.

295
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,111
太好了  那我就放心了
Well, that's a load off.

296
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:16,488
我习惯给一些势利小人开车了
I'm used to driving around snobby guys.

297
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,733
所以我们现在去哪里  你有想去的地方吗
Hey, so where to? Anywhere you want?

298
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
我刚好知道一个地方
I know just the place.

299
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,466
两根吸管
Double straws?

300
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,866
第一根免费
First one's free.

301
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,244
第二根要付钱
You're payin' for that second one.

302
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,422
好好听的喇叭声
Sweet bimminy boo.

303
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:32,933
重要的客户来了
One side! Important customer!

304
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:37,111
欢迎来到菲利普的小店
Welcome to Flip's.

305
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,444
请享用您的免费饮料
Please enjoy your complimentary Flippy.

306
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,977
菲利普  你以前可从来没给过我免费的东西
Wow, Flip, you've never given me anything free before.

307
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,955
你以前可没有豪华轿车
Well, you never had a limo before.

308
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,444
我现在和一个坐着超豪华轿车的人在一起
I'm here with a very important limo rider

309
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:53,288
他刚刚才开进了镇里
who just rode into town.

310
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,622
告诉我们  你如何变得那么成功
Tell us--how did you get to be so important?

311
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,622
我喜欢你的豪华轿车
Say there, I like your limo.

312
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:04,600
你是怎么得到的
How did you obtain it?

313
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,933
呃  芥末酱
Uh, mustard.

314
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,377
你一定是芥末酱生意的继承人吧
Oh, you must be the heir to the mustard fortune.

315
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,666
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

316
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,000
林肯·劳德  但我不是
Lincoln Loud. But I'm not the--

317
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,933
我是泰德伯爵  是绳球生意的继承人
I'm Lord Tetherbee, heir to the Tetherball fortune.

318
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,333
我正要去我私人的乡村俱乐部
I was just heading to my exclusive country club.

319
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,688
你要和我一起吗
Care to join me?

320
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,066
柯比  跟着那辆车
Kirby, follow that limo.

321
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,200
谢啦  柯比
Thanks, Kirby.

322
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:34,711
欢迎来到泰德乡村俱乐部
Welcome to the Tetherbee Country Club.

323
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,955
好舒服
Ooh, comfy.

324
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,577
当然了  现在我们去吃饭吧  老兄
Of course. Now shall we dine, old bean?

325
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,111
太好了  老  呃
Sounds good to me, old, uh...

326
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,200
萝卜
carrot?

327
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,511
我还能为你做什么吗  先生
Is there anything else I can get you, sir?

328
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,866
你不用叫我先生
Oh, you don't need to call me "Sir."

329
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,911
叫我林肯就行了
You can call me Lincoln.

330
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,177
听着  劳德
See here, Loud,

331
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,066
一个坐豪华轿车的人不会对那些仆人太好
a man in a limo doesn't act all chummy with the help.

332
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,733
这样只会让他们困惑
It only confuses them.

333
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,730
现在让我们像坐豪华轿车的有钱人一样  到镇上去逛逛
Now let's hit the town as limo people do.

334
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:18,466
豪华轿车来了
Limo! Limo coming through!

335
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:26,622
我从来不知道生活可以像这样
I never knew life could be like this.

336
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:44,000
现在已经四点四十五分了  劳德
I say, it's a quarter to five, Loud.

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,777
我们要不要在集市关门之前去逛逛
Shall we check on the markets before they close?

338
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,777
没关系  一般都是我妈妈去买东西的
That's okay, my mom usually does the shopping.

339
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,177
等下  四点四十五
Wait! A quarter to five?

340
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,977
我要去接我的姐妹们了
I'm supposed to pick up my sisters

341
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,577
还要带他们去打嗝汉堡店
and take them to to the Burpin' Burger.

342
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,400
打嗝汉堡店
The Burpin' Burger?

343
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,866
是啊  
Yeah, you know...

344
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,200
二级牛肉还有特殊调料
Grade B beef and special spice

345
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,000
翻过来吃味道更好
When it comes back up it's twice as nice

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,955
听着  劳德  你是一个坐豪华轿车的人
Look here, Loud, you're a man in a limo.

347
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,733
你不能被人家看见
You can't be seen in some rat hole

348
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,377
在一个用身体机能命名的老鼠洞里
named after a bodily function.

349
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,088
这样是不对的
It's just not done.

350
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,444
可是我的姐妹们
But my sisters...

351
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,933
我们都有令人尴尬的亲戚们
We all have embarrassing relations.

352
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,711
我有一个二表弟  他坐公交车去上班
I have a second cousin who takes the bus to work.

353
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,644
你能想象吗
Can you imagine?

354
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,000
最重要的是我们不能被他们拖了后腿
The point is we can't let them hold us back.

355
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,488
来吧  老兄  现在是轿车帆航时间
Now come on, old bean, it's time for limo sailing.

356
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,044
风景太棒了
This view is incredible!

357
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,133
看  海豚
Oh, look, dolphins!

358
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,000
我要骑一只玩玩
I think I'll ride one.

359
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,622
等等我
Wait for me, old broccoli stalk.

360
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,666
我有惊喜送给你
I've got a little surprise for you.

361
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:44,488
今晚我们俱乐部有个盛会
We're holding a gala at the club tonight

362
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,822
来欢迎我们的新成员  就是你
to welcome our newest member--you!

363
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,733
-谢谢  老  呃  芹菜  -不客气
-Wow, thanks old, uh, celery? -Don't mention it.

364
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,666
你会和我们相处很融洽的
I think you'll fit in splendidly.

365
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,444
还有记着  只能"戴黑领带"
And remember, it's black tie only.

366
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,244
不穿裤子和其他的吗
No pants or anything?

367
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,400
你太搞笑了
Oh, Loud, you are a stitch.

368
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:05,422
抱歉  走错房子了
Sorry! Wrong house!

369
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,933
你去哪里了
Where have you been?

370
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,066
我们站在路边等了超过三个小时
We were standing on the curb for over three hours.

371
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,333
收垃圾的人差点要把拉娜扔到垃圾桶里去
The garbage guys literally tried to take Lana to the dump.

372
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,622
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

373
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,022
我一天都忙着和很有钱的泰德伯爵在一起
I had a busy day with the very wealthy Lord Tetherbee

374
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,822
我真的抽不开身
and I just couldn't get away.

375
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,244
我不敢相信你竟然和一个随便认识的有钱人
I cannot believe you have been hanging out

376
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,488
在一起玩了一天
with some random rich guy all day,

377
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,777
而不是带你们亲生姐妹们去打嗝汉堡店
instead of taking your own sisters to the Burpin' Burger!

378
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,177
一个坐豪华轿车的人不能被人家看见
A man in a limo can't be seen

379
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,600
待在一个用身体机能命名的老鼠洞里
in some rat hole named after a bodily function.

380
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,266
这样是不对的
It's just not done.

381
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,244
你不是一个坐在豪华轿车里的人
You're not a man in a limo.

382
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,044
你只是一个吃了一堆芥末酱的小孩
You're a kid who ate a bunch of mustard.

383
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,977
马上你的豪华轿车就要走了
As soon as your limo's gone,

384
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,333
你的幻想马上就要结束了
this little fantasy of yours is going to be over.

385
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,000
真的吗
Oh, really?

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,200
这就是为什么他们
Is that why they're making me a member

387
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,866
要给我一个记忆深刻的俱乐部之夜吗
of their club tonight?

388
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,860
恕我失陪
Now if you'll excuse me,

389
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,377
我要穿上我的正装
I need to put on my formalwear.

390
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,422
等着吧  林肯
You'll see, Lincoln.

391
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,822
你并没我高我们一等
You're no better than the rest of us.

392
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,266
没有高我们一等
No better than the rest of us?

393
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,377
她怎么敢这么说
How dare she?

394
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,511
我是一个很重要的人
I'm the important person

395
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,577
而且我要去一个很重要的地方
and I've got important places to be.

396
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,733
说到这个  为什么我们不动了
Speaking of which, why aren't we moving?

397
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,711
简直难以忍受
This is unacceptable.

398
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,244
你就不能想办法开过去吗
Can't you drive around this?

399
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,466
对不起  林肯  我也没办法
There's nothing I can do. Sorry, Lincoln.

400
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,066
别叫我林肯  叫我先生
Don't call me Lincoln. It's sir.

401
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,288
泰德是对的
Tetherbee was right.

402
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,911
如果你对于仆人太亲切
If you get too chummy with the help,

403
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,488
会让他们混淆的
it just confuses them.

404
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,288
我们直说吧  柯比
Let's keep this straight, Kirby.

405
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,044
我是一个坐豪华轿车的人
I'm the man in the limo.

406
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,688
你是开车的司机
You're the man driving the limo.

407
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,511
这是什么声音
And what's all this beeping?

408
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,555
这是计时器  先生
It's the timer, sir.

409
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,444
你的一天结束了
Your day is up.

410
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,244
你不是一个坐在豪华轿车里的人了
You're no longer a man in a limo.

411
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,266
什么
What?

412
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,488
你才是个笑话
Well, the joke's on you,

413
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,688
因为我顺走了你的一些芥末酱
'cause I took some of your mustard.

414
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:54,955
我现在在哪里
Where the heck am I?

415
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,977
乖狗狗
Nice puppies.

416
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,400
你们喜欢辣的酱料吗
Do you like spicy brown?

417
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,244
我更喜欢经典口味的
I'm more of a classic yellow fan, myself.

418
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,555
你才是个笑话
The joke's on you.

419
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,044
这些不是真的礼服鞋
These aren't real dress shoes.

420
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,222
这些是我用马克笔涂的运动鞋
They're sneakers I colored in with a marker.

421
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:23,333
你才是个笑话  因为  呃
But the joke's on you 'cause, uh...

422
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,200
我在开谁玩笑呢
Oh, who am I kidding?

423
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,822
我才是个笑话
The joke's on me.

424
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,311
嗨  泰德
Hello, Tetherbee?

425
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,933
是我  劳德  我来参加我的盛会了
It's me, Loud. I'm here for my gala.

426
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,933
劳德  你怎么了
I say, Loud, what happened to you?

427
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,622
主要是  你的豪华轿车呢
And, more importantly, what happened to your limo?

428
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,200
我不再拥有它了
I don't have it anymore.

429
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,333
没有他  你不可能加入这个俱乐部
Without a limo, you cannot possibly join the club.

430
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,933
这是不对的
It just isn't done.

431
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,822
可是  老  呃  豆芽
But, old, uh, sprout,

432
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,044
我以为我非常合适
I thought I fit in splendidly.

433
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,711
是啊  那是在你有豪华轿车的时候
You did--when you had a limo.

434
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,222
恕我失陪
Now, if you'll excuse me,

435
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,666
我有八百只林肯气球要戳爆
I have about 800 Lincoln balloons to pop.

436
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:12,955
现在我和一个曾经拥有豪华轿车的人在一起
I'm here with a former limo rider.

437
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,511
告诉我们  你是怎么从高处一下子跌落谷底的
Tell us, how does a man who rose so high sink so low?

438
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,755
我渐渐开始觉得我高人一等
Well, I started to think that I was better than everybody

439
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,555
而且我的行为像一个真混蛋一样
and acted like a real jerk.

440
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,088
可是事实上
But the truth is,

441
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,444
我只是一个吃了一堆芥末酱的小孩
I'm just a kid who ate a bunch of mustard.

442
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:29,133
我觉得应该是番茄酱
Looks more like ketchup to this reporter.

443
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,266
打嗝汉堡店  有了
Burpin' Burger? That's it!

444
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,866
我知道怎么弥补这一切了
I know how to fix everything.

445
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,066
我可以搭个车吗  搭这个新车吗
Can I get a ride? In the news van?

446
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,466
这是不可能的
It just isn't done.

447
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:43,133
拜托
Oh, come on.

448
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,133
你们还喜欢吃番茄酱啊
You guys like ketchup, too?

449
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,577
是林肯和他的酷炫芥末酱豪华轿车
Oh, it's Lincoln and his fancy mustard limo.

450
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,644
我以为他只能拥有一天
I thought he only had it for a day.

451
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,088
我们还得继续忍受他的态度吗
We've gotta put up with more of his attitude?

452
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,822
这不是我的豪华轿车
The limo's not for me.

453
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,133
是你们的
It's for you.

454
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,955
我对我昨天的行为感到非常抱歉
I'm sorry about the way I acted yesterday.

455
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,844
我不应该违背
I never should have broken my promise

456
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,840
我带你们去打嗝汉堡店的承诺
to take you guys to the Burpin' Burger.

457
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,666
你们饿了吗  别等了
Hungry, y'all? Look no fur--

458
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,466
轻点  他在认错呢  继续
Quiet! He's groveling. Proceed.

459
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,822
是啊  所以  我打电话给柯比道歉
Right, so, I called Kirby and apologized.

460
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,111
他答应再多载我们一次
He's agreed to give us one more ride.

461
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,133
我知道现在你们可能很生我的气
Now I know you're probably so mad at me

462
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,644
甚至不想去
that you don't even want--

463
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:26,222
我猜他们是原谅我了
I guess they forgive me.

464
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:30,355
欢迎来到打嗝汉堡店
Welcome to Burpin' Burger.

465
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,022
你们要点些什么
May I take your order?

466
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,000
亲爱的  来十一份汉堡和薯条
Eleven burgers and fries, love.

467
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,533
别忘了柯比的那份
Don't forget one for Kirby.

468
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,666
谢了  先生
Thank you, sir.

469
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,377
哦不  林肯
I mean, Lincoln.

470
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,577
唯一一件比做一个坐在豪华轿车里的人
The only thing better than being a man in a limo

471
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,666
更好的事情是一家人一起坐在豪华轿车里
is being a family in a limo.

472
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,733
嗨  劳德  很高兴看到你回到豪华轿车了
I say, Loud, it's good to see you back in a limo.

473
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,666
你为什么不甩了这些乌合之众
What say you ditch the riff-raff

474
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,422
回到俱乐部来呢
and come back to the club?

475
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,022
你知道吗  泰德
You know what, Tetherbee?

476
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,511
为什么不来点芥末酱
How about some mustard!

477
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,888
来搭配你那些蠢话
To go with that baloney!

478
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,822
你们都饿了吧  别再观望了
Hungry, y'all? Look no further.

479
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,755
快来打嗝汉堡店
Come on down to Burpin' Burger

480
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,466
二级牛肉还有特殊调料
Grade B beef and special spice

481
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,622
翻过来吃味道更好
When it comes back up it's twice as nice
