313
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,116
- No-o-o!

314
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:54,119
[sobbing] I can't believe
I missed my show.

315
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:58,123
[sobs]

316
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,392
- Sorry you missed your show,
Lincoln.

317
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,662
- But you just lived it.
Check it out.

318
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,197
- It's a ghost
and it knows my name!

319
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,166
[all screaming]

320
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:08,933
[laughter]

321
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,036
- I wasn't scared at all.

322
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,971
- You know, I may have
missed my show,

323
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,707
but sometimes, it's not about
being there first.

324
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,411
Sometimes, it's about
being there together,

325
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,178
all of us.

326
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,147
- You forgot me.
[all scream]

327
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,252
