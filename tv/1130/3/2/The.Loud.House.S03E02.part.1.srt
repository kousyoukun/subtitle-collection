Your pic almost got as many likes as Carol Pingrey's.

00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,650
字幕
Ow. Carol Pingrey?

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,350
字幕
I didn't even know she was on this app.

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,490
字幕
She just joined. Can you believe

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,160
字幕
her first selfie got 101 likes?

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,990
字幕
Give me that.

12
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,030

has to one-up me in everything I do.

14
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,810
字幕
Don't feel bad Lori. You sold almost

15
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,340
字幕
as many cookies as Carol.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,280
字幕
Oh, don't feel bad, Lori,

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,550
字幕
you got almost as many votes as Carol.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,260
字幕
Yay, Lori! You got way more points than Carol.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,700
字幕
Thanks, Leni. But let me explain golf scoring. Again.

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,700
字幕
Uhh! I'm sick of it.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,360
字幕
I've literally been working for three months

22
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,940
字幕
to get this many likes on my photos.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,820
字幕
I am not letting Carol waltz in here

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,440
字幕
and show me up again!

25
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,890
字幕
I swear on my senior parking space,

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,810
字幕
my next selfie will get more likes than Carol Pingrey!

27
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,740
字幕
Yay! Go Lori!

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,170
字幕
Um, could I have my phone back so I can like Carol's photo?

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,500
字幕
I don't wanna be rude.

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,760
字幕
Okay, got my soft lighting, my flowers.

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,540
字幕
Time for the mirror selfie.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,950
字幕
Literally a classic.

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,490
字幕
And, done!

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,620
字幕
Lana! What are you doing?!

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,430
字幕
Installing a dual-flush valve.

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,780
字幕
- Get out. - I thought you,

37
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,720
字幕
of all people, would appreciate the pressure-assisted flush.

38
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,500
字幕
Out!

39
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,810
字幕
Yeah, that's not gonna beat Carol.

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,530
字幕
Delete.

41
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,380
字幕
Okay, got my sun hat, my SPF

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,750
字幕
and my strawberry lemonade with a little umbrella.

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,910
字幕
Time for the fun-in-the-sun selfie.

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,420
字幕
Always a crowd pleaser.

45
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,330
字幕
Loud takes a wicked cut and...

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,390
字幕
Dang it, Lynn!

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,260
字幕
I'm the one who should be cheesed.

48
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,840
字幕
You just robbed me of a double.

49
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,010
字幕
Let's try this again.

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,730
字幕
- Poo poo. - I can't change you

51
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,510
字幕
right now, Lily.

52
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,910
字幕
Go ask someone else.

53
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,800
字幕
Poo poo!

54
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,320
字幕
40 minute scalding hot shower.

55
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,040
字幕
Let's do this again.

56
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,690
字幕
- Literally? - Sorry,

57
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,010
字幕
but I've claimed this area for my cemetery.

58
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,300
字幕
Okay. Doors locked, siblings gone.

59
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,420
字幕
Perfect conditions for the lost-in-thought selfie.

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,370
字幕
Mysterious, yet intriguing.

61
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,250
字幕
Lincoln, move your dumb toy.

62
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,760
字幕
You're photobombing me.

63
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,920
字幕
Oops, sorry.

64
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,590
字幕
Ahh! My hair!

65
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,230
字幕
It's not fair. I'm never going to be able

66
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,380
字幕
to take a decent picture with my insane siblings everywhere.

67
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,610
字幕
Hey, guys, who wants to help me rake leaves?

68
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,020
字幕
We could really make the yard look nice.

69
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,930
字幕
- Ew, no. - Sorry!

70
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,170
字幕
I was just leaving!

71
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,920
字幕
Do I know my siblings or what?

72
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,920
字幕
- Hey, babe. - Sorry, Boo Boo Bear,

73
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,940
字幕
our daily 4:00 phone chat will have to wait.

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,630
字幕
I need to take the perfect leaf-jumping selfie.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,310
字幕
That's gonna be kinda hard, babe

76
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,360
字幕
but leaves don't jump.

77
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,120
字幕
Not the leaves, Bobby. Me.

78
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,650
字幕
Oh, okay, cool. Yeah, well,

79
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,240
字幕
I just need someone to talk to, you know.

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,080
字幕
I have that dentist appointment I had told you about,

81
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,550
字幕
and I'm kinda nervous.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,640
字幕
Sorry, Bobby. Can we talk about this later?

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,130
字幕
The light won't be this good forever.

84
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,430
字幕
Love you. Bye!

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,580
字幕
Okay, scarf draped, leaves piled, timer set.

86
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,150
字幕
Here we go. Whee!

87
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,870
字幕
Okay, forget leaves. Let's do a good, old-fashioned

88
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,260
字幕
tire swing selfie.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,720
字幕
Ahh! Bees!

90
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,060
字幕
Okay, forget tires. How about a rainy day selfie?

91
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,350
字幕
Ugh, where's my rain?

92
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,390
字幕
Forget rainy days. Let's do a tractor selfie.

93
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,390
字幕
Those are a thing, right?

94
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,630
字幕
Wow, it's actually literally perfect.

95
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,450
字幕
And I didn't hurt myself.

And in your face, Carol Pingrey.

100
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,560
字幕
So sore.

101
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,510

Cute tractor selfie, Lori.

103
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,660
字幕
as many likes as Carol's.

104
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,690
字幕
Lemme see that.

105
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,950
字幕
- That rat! - I think it's a corgi.

106
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,590
字幕
No, it's a dirty trick, putting a cute,

107
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,030
字幕
loveable animal in her selfie to get more likes than me.

108
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,640
字幕
Well, guess what, Carol?

109
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,020
字幕
Cute, loveable animals are my middle name.

110
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,600
字幕
I thought it was Marie.

111
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,620
字幕
Get back here, you animals!

112
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,490
字幕
These tiny sweaters are literally

113
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,890
字幕
the perfect size for you!

114
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,760
字幕
- Come in. - Um, Lola, you're good

115
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,110
字幕
at photo retouching, right?

116
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,530
字幕
I think my work speaks for itself.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,120
字幕
Let's see what you got.

118
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,500
字幕
Ooh, this is gonna cost you

119
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,250
字幕
some serious cupcakes.

120
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,590
字幕
103 likes. Take that, Carol.

121

字幕
Cute pet selfie, Lori.

124
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,570
字幕
It got almost as many likes as Carol's coffee shop selfie.

125
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,680
字幕
What?!

126
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,340
字幕
Not now, Bobby.

127
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,050
字幕
I've got a crisis.

128
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,510
字幕
Look, I'll play a barista

129
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,640
字幕
but I am not wearing suspenders.

130
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,970
字幕
This has to look like a real coffee shop.

131
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,970
字幕
Now, do you want a ride to the comic book store later or not?

132
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,640
字幕
Okay, so now you guys pretend

133
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,060
字幕
to laugh at something I've just said.

134
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,390
字幕
Ooh! Was it coffee-related humor?

135
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,070
字幕
It doesn't matter, Luan.

136
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,300
字幕
Maybe you said this: Why'd the hipster

137
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,290
字幕
burn his tongue?

138
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,630
字幕
He sipped his coffee before it was cool.

139
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,180
字幕
Yes! 105 likes.

140
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,930
字幕
Lincoln, you can take the suspenders off now.

141
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,200
字幕
Actually they're kind of working for me.

142
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,690
字幕
Leni, please do not tell me that Carol outdid me

143
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,150
字幕
with a selfie of her sailing or icing a cake

144
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,090
字幕
or swimming with dolphins. - Nope.

145
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,470
字幕
But she did get the most likes ever for a picnic selfie.

146
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,590
字幕
Picnics are totes trending right now.

147
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,430
字幕
Babe, oh, I'm so happy you called

148
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,330
字幕
Boo Boo Bear, we literally need to go on

149
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,100
字幕
a picnic right now. - Right now? Babe, you know

150
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,190
字幕
I love picnics, but we live three hours apart.

151
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,070
字幕
- I'm just about to get into my-- - Bobby!

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,600
字幕
This is life or death. Meet me at the rest stop

153
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,820
字幕
by exit 57 at 4:00, sharp.

154
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,380
字幕
I think I can make it there by five.

155
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,150
字幕
Guh, fine. I guess picnics will still be trending then.

156
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,910
字幕
But no later. And wear your red button down if it's ironed.

157
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,290
字幕
If not, wear your teal polo. Please, do not

158
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,720
字幕
mess up my color scheme!

159
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,550
字幕
Huh. This should do.

160
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,020
字幕
Ugh! Where is Bobby?

161
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,540
字幕
Boo Boo Bear!

162
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,940
字幕
You made it.

163
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,150
字幕
Ohh, babe!

164
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,840
字幕
What did you do to yourself?

165
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,590
字幕
Uh, good thing I brought scarves.

166
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,220
字幕
Maybe can hide the swelling.

167
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,460
字幕
Or I could just shoot you from behind.

168
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,830
字幕
Babe, I got my wisdom teeth out, remember?

169
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,150
字幕
I told you weeks ago.

170
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,060
字幕
Oh, my gosh. You did.

171
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,330
字幕
Boo Boo Bear, I am so sorry.

172
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,570
字幕
I've been so selfish. I can't believe

173
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,350
字幕
you still drove all this way.

174
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,760
字幕
Especially after what you've been through.

175
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,930
字幕
Oh, babe, I would drive to the moon for you.

176
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,970
字幕
Ohh, Boo Boo Bear.

177
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,250
字幕
You know what? Forget about the dumb selfie.

178
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,380
字幕
Let's just make the most of our time together.

179
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,400
字幕
I can't believe I've been so obsessed

180
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,010
字幕
with trying to beat Carol Pingrey.

181
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,010
字幕
Maybe she is better than me at everything.

182
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,950
字幕
But who cares? I still have

183
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,550
字幕
lots of great things in my life.

184
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,110
字幕
Like a really amazing boyfriend, for starters.

185
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,130
字幕
Aww, Boo Boo Bear.

186
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,480
字幕
Ice chip in tooth socket.

187
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,890
字幕
Hi, I'd like to return all this picnic stuff.

188
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,150
字幕
I don't need it anymore.

189
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,770
字幕
Carol.

190
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
字幕
Um, Carol? -

191
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,090
字幕
Uh--uh, hi, Lori.

192
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,990
字幕
I know this is literally the most awkward thing

193
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,650
字幕
in the world, but I just wanna tell you

194
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,980
字幕
that you win.

195
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,230
字幕
You've been better than me at everything since kindergarten.

196
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,710
字幕
But I'm okay with it. I can't live my life

197
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,270
字幕
trying to compete with you anymore.

198
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,320
字幕
Well, enjoy your shopping.

199
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,320
字幕
Lori, wait.

200
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,030
字幕
You think I'm better than you ?

201
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,120
字幕
I kinda thought it was the other way around.

202
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,990
字幕
I--I mean, you made the varsity golf team

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,990
字幕
when we were freshmen.

204
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,310
字幕
No one else did that.

205
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,010
字幕
And you have ten siblings who all look up to you.

206
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,830
字幕
And don't get me started on your hair.

207
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,360
字幕
I will never have volume like that.

208
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,160
字幕
This takes, like, six cans of dry shampoo.

209
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,600
字幕
And it's still flat.

210
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,880
字幕
So all of our competing has literally been pointless?

211
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,260
字幕
It's true.

212
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,640
字幕
Those selfies were getting out of control.

213
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,280
字幕
I had to adopt that corgi and he's mean.

214
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,570
字幕
I fell into a grave. Twice.

215
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,770
字幕
We're ridiculous.

216
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,810
字幕
I'm so glad we're done with all this.

217
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,970
字幕
Me too. Hey, I just had a crazy idea.

218
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,510
字幕
What if we made it official by taking a selfie together?

219
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,370
字幕
Shut up! Looking like this?

220
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,560
字幕
Yeah! I mean, who cares, right?

221
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,920
字幕
Post.

222
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,290
字幕
Cute pic of you and Carol.

223
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,060
字幕
You guys got tons of likes.

224
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,880
字幕
Thank, Leni. But I don't even care about that anymore.

225
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,220
字幕
Almost as many as Bianca and Sooyoung.

226
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,430
字幕
Hey, Carol, I just did.

227
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,330
字幕
I know. They think they can beat us

228
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,410
字幕
with a BFF selfie?

229
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,930
字幕
Oh, it is so on.
