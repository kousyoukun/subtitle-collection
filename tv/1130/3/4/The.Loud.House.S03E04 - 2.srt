1
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,350
字幕
Whoa! Oof!

2
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,100
字幕
What animal does Mary have?

3
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,080
字幕
A lamb with the fleece as white as snow.

4
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,330
字幕
Oh, good, it's really you, son.

5
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,190
字幕
Are you sure Luan didn't follow you?

6
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,800
字幕
Definitely, I took four different buses.

7
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,900
字幕
Plus, I've got Clyde doing surveillance on her.

8
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,480
字幕
Great, now, let's get down to business.

9
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,910
字幕
April Fool's Day is tomorrow,

10
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,820
字幕
and we still don't have a plan to stop Luan

11
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,180
字幕
from pranking our butts off.

12
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,520
字幕
So who's got an idea?

13
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,430
字幕
Oh! Bobby said we could hide in the basement of the bodega.

14
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,410
字幕
We just have to watch out for the rat traps.

15
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,540
字幕
And the asbestos.

16
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,900
字幕
You're really selling it, honey.

17
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,210
字幕
There's an island off the southern tip of Guam.

18
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,950
字幕
You can only get to it by submarine.

19
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,580
字幕
We don't have passports, Stinkin'!

20
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,030
字幕
Pending some grant money,

21
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,580
字幕
I could build a ship that could take us to Europa,

22
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,140
字幕
one of Jupiter's moons.

23
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,580
字幕
Or we could dig a system of tunnels under the house!

24
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,730
字幕
Why don't we just ask Luan to stop?

25
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,870
字幕
But, like, really nicely?

26
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,890
字幕
Ugh. Maybe it's hopeless.

27
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,050
字幕
Excuse me, do you folks mind?

28
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,950
字幕
We're trying to shoot a movie here.

29
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,980
字幕
Yeah, guys, out of the shot!

30
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,280
字幕
Okay, I'm ready for my close-up.

31
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,220
字幕
Sorry, little girl, you need to get out of the shot too.

32
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,250
字幕
We're shooting a dangerous stunt.

33
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,490
字幕
Ha! Your loss!

34
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,530
字幕
And action!

35
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,770
字幕
Cut!

36
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,460
字幕
Man, that guy can really take a beating!

37
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,360
字幕
He looks just like Dad!

38
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,710
字幕
Too bad I can't just hire him

39
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,470
字幕
to take all of Luan's pranks for me.

40
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,120
字幕
I wasn't being serious.

41
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,510
字幕
But Dad, maybe that's the perfect plan.

42
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,170
字幕
We hire a bunch of stunt doubles

43
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,280
字幕
to take all the hits for us,

44
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
字幕
and we get off pain-free.

45
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,910
字幕
That might just work!

46
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,780
字幕
Wow, these doubles look just like us.

47
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,660
字幕
No, honey, those are the doubles.

48
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,800
字幕
Oh, well, they're good too.

49
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,530
字幕
So, uh, what's this gonna cost me?

50
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,060
字幕
Is this in dollars?

51
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,660
字幕
I don't understand.

52
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,270
字幕
Why is my double old?

53
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,950
字幕
You're 11 and you have white hair,

54
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,180
字幕
I did the best I could.

55
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,040
字幕
I came out of retirement for this gig.

56
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,950
字幕
These days, I mostly just sit around reading in my underwear.

57
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,640
字幕
Never mind, he's perfect.

58
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,900
字幕
Okay, fam-o,

59
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,260
字幕
now that everyone's got a double,

60
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,380
字幕
it's time to teach them how to look and act just like us.

61
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,350
字幕
We've got to work fast.

62
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,130
字幕
Luan gets home at five, and if she finds the house empty

63
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,070
字幕
Are you picking up on this?

64
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,840
字幕
I talk with my hands, big hand talker right here.

65
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,950
字幕
Really get that mud up in your face.

66
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,740
字幕
Don't be afraid to eat a little.

67
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,780
字幕
Now, in addition to English,

68
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,730
字幕
I speak Mandarin, Latin, Swedish, and West Coast rap.

69
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,620
字幕
So this is the novel I'm working on.

70
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,690
字幕
Just in case Luan asks you about it,

71
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,580
字幕
you should probably read the whole thing tonight.

72
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,980
字幕
Okay, so let's see the walk.

73
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,240
字幕
Almost, but you forgot part of it.

74
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,740
字幕
First thing in the morning,

75
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,130
字幕
I usually rush to the bathroom to beat the crowd.

76
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,440
字幕
Oh, same here.

77
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,020
字幕
There's some pushy blue-hairs at the senior center.

78
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,110
字幕
Then before school, I'll sometimes stop for a Flippee.

79
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,790
字幕
Watermelon lime's my favorite.

80
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
字幕
It's my favorite flavor of gelatin!

81
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,750
字幕
Okay, gang, here's the plan.

82
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,900
字幕
At midnight, we sneak out of the house

83
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,700
字幕
and switch places with the doubles.

84
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,990
字幕
They'll take it from there.

85
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,840
字幕
I got this.

86
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
字幕
Good luck to you guys.

87
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,680
字幕
- Are you sure you're ready? - Don't worry about us.

88
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,760
字幕
We're gonna be A-Okay.

89
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,950
字幕
Family, gather 'round.

90
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,040
字幕
We can follow the action via the cameras I installed

91
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,750
字幕
in everyone's room last year...

92
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,340
字幕
Last night!

93
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,990
字幕
Ooh! We have movement in the twins' room!

94
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,590
字幕
Here it comes!

95
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,060
字幕
I thought for sure Luan was gonna nail them

96
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,310
字幕
with a bucket of grease.

97
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,140
字幕
Or a sock full of quarters!

98
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,110
字幕
Old Lincoln is on the move!

99
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,200
字幕
Slowly.

100
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,720
字幕
Oh, man, I can't watch. What's happening?

101
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,110
字幕
Did he get injured?

102
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,790
字幕
Well, he did hurt his back, but it seems unrelated.

103
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,310
字幕
What's the dealio?

104
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,930
字幕
Why aren't they getting pranked?

105
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,090
字幕
Why are they leaving the house?

106
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:39,974
字幕
What the heck?

107
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:42,724
字幕
I paid good money for them to get their butts pranked off!

108
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,225
字幕
Wait a minute, I get it.

109
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:48,557
字幕
Luan's prank this year was not to prank us at all.

110
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:49,474
字幕
What do you mean, Mom?

111
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:52,641
字幕
Ha! She knew we'd go crazy trying to protect ourselves,

112
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,225
字幕
so she just let us chase our tails.

113
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:56,641
字幕
Oh, you're right!

114
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,141
字幕
She is good.

115
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:02,016
字幕
Well, I may have burned through all our savings,

116
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:03,016
字幕
but at least it's over!

117
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:06,390
字幕
Over? It's just getting started!

118
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:10,516
字幕
You know, family, I had a whole different plan

119
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:11,474
字幕
in mind for today,

120
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:12,974
字幕
but I'll save that for next year,

121
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:16,306
字幕
because once I saw the amazing doubles you guys found,

122
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:20,266
字幕
I was inspired to do something even better.

123
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,933
字幕
So stay tuned,

124
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,099
字幕
because the rest of this day

125
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,306
字幕
is going to be doubly special!

126
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:31,766
字幕
Get it? You don't now, but you will.

127
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:33,557
字幕
What is she talking about?

128
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,306
字幕
We gotta stop her!

129
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,933
字幕
Ugh, she welded the door shut!

130
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,432
字幕
And the windows!

131
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:41,808
字幕
I'll try the garage door.

132
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:42,849
字幕
Where's the remote?

133
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:46,349
字幕
Oh, Luan does, she's outside!

134
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:48,766
字幕
Don't look at me,

135
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:49,724
字幕
look at the monitors!

136
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:53,432
字幕
I put cameras everywhere so you can enjoy the show.

137
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,266
字幕
Ah! It's old Lincoln!

138
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,516
字幕
What's he doing?

139
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:00,557
字幕
Did he get lost?

140
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,349
字幕
Mrs. Johnson, it's me, Lincoln.

141
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:10,891
字幕
I can't get through another day of school

142
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:11,891
字幕
without telling you

143
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,808
字幕
you are the center of my universe!

144
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:17,058
字幕
And I love you!

145
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:18,099
字幕
Oh, no!

146
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,058
字幕
Wait! That's my pageant studio!

147
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,306
字幕
Hi, Lindsey, I know I won Miss Junior Royal Woods

148
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:25,891
字幕
this year, but the truth is,

149
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:26,974
字幕
your neck is straighter,

150
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,766
字幕
your hair holds curls better than mine,

151
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:31,266
字幕
and your baton twirling puts mine to shame.
