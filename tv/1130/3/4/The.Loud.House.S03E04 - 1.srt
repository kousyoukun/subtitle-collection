×ÖÄ»
There it is, the big city!

2
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,372
×ÖÄ»
Can I get a warning next time?

3
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:47,581
×ÖÄ»
Sorry, Lincoln, I'm just so excited.

4
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,079
×ÖÄ»
We're visiting Bobby and Ronnie Anne this weekend,

5
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,664
×ÖÄ»
so Lori can get to know the city better.

6
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,664
×ÖÄ»
I'm just tagging along for moral support.

7
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:56,747
×ÖÄ»
And some of that delicious casagrande cuisine.

8
00:00:56,747 --> 00:00:59,247
×ÖÄ»
Can you believe it? As soon as I graduate,

9
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:01,956
×ÖÄ»
I'll literally be going to college here.

10
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:03,747
×ÖÄ»
What happened to the warning?

11
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:06,706
×ÖÄ»
Sorry, I just know how much I'm going to love it here.

12
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,205
×ÖÄ»
I've always been a city girl at heart.

13
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,247
×ÖÄ»
How about you? Are you excited to see Ronnie Anne?

14
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:26,747
×ÖÄ»
Oh, yeah, we're gonna have a blast.

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,414
×ÖÄ»
I've missed her.

16
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:42,914
×ÖÄ»
- A little lower. - A little higher.

17
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:45,414
×ÖÄ»
Ugh, why do we even need a sign?

18
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:47,079
×ÖÄ»
When did we become sign people?

19
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,330
×ÖÄ»
I just watched a fascinating documentary

20
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,539
×ÖÄ»
on the role of signage in expanding our freeway systems.

21
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,414
×ÖÄ»
- It seems that-- - Here, honey.

22
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,079
×ÖÄ»
Try my taquitos.

23
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,664
×ÖÄ»
Ronnie Anne, I've narrowed it down to two dresses.

24
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:00,079
×ÖÄ»
Has anyone seen her?

25
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,455
×ÖÄ»
Ronnie Anne!

26
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:06,414
×ÖÄ»
Phew, I may smell like dog all day,

27
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:08,414
×ÖÄ»
but it's worth it.

28
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,330
×ÖÄ»
Out of my way, out of my way,

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,539
×ÖÄ»
I'm cleansing the place of unkind spirits.

30
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,330
×ÖÄ»
Can't see.

31
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,706
×ÖÄ»
Mayday! Mayday!

32
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:18,372
×ÖÄ»
- Gah! - Oof!

33
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,581
×ÖÄ»
Lincoln and Lori are here! Hooray!

34
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:23,831
×ÖÄ»
- Hi, CJ! - Hey, buddy.

35
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,247
×ÖÄ»
- Long time, no see. - Welcome back!

36
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:28,664
×ÖÄ»
Hey, how were the road signs on your way in?

37
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:33,372
×ÖÄ»
Greetings, my lovely cousin.

38
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:34,289
×ÖÄ»
Oh, hey, Carl.

39
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,497
×ÖÄ»
Come in! Come in!

40
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:37,330
×ÖÄ»
Bobby's down in the bodega. Go say hi.

41
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,079
×ÖÄ»
But if he's trapped himself in the dairy case again,

42
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,539
×ÖÄ»
don't let him out, he has to learn.

43
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,789
×ÖÄ»
I wasn't sure if you wanted breakfast or lunch,

44
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,079
×ÖÄ»
- so I made both! - I could eat both!

45
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,664
×ÖÄ»
Te adoro, mijito!

46
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,706
×ÖÄ»
Gotcha, Lincoln. Let's go!

47
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:57,372
×ÖÄ»
Time to walk the plank.

48
00:02:57,372 --> 00:03:00,079
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I respect the laws of the sea,

49
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,079
×ÖÄ»
but can I eat first?

50
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,414
×ÖÄ»
Sure, I'm a pirate, but I'm fair.

51
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,079
×ÖÄ»
Welcome back, lame-o.

52
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,789
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Ronnie Anne, I brought you a present.

53
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:15,956
×ÖÄ»
Oh, cool, a Royal Woods sweatshirt.

54
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,079
×ÖÄ»
I got it at Gus' Games 'n Grub.

55
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,455
×ÖÄ»
Uh, sorry it smells like garlic knots.

56
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,079
×ÖÄ»
Beats smelling like a dog.

57
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,414
×ÖÄ»
Thanks.

58
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:24,789
×ÖÄ»
Ronnie Anne,

59
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:25,706

it's Sameer calling.

60
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,330
×ÖÄ»
- I'll call him back later. - Who's Sameer?

61
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,079
×ÖÄ»
Oh, Sameer's a part of Ronnie Anne's little group of friends.

62
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,914
×ÖÄ»
They're all thick as thieves.

63
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:35,622
×ÖÄ»
It's so sweet!

64
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,079

Cool, I'd love to meet them.

65
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,079

No, no, this weekend's all about you.

66

Come on, we have a lot of catching up to do.

67

×ÖÄ»
Oh, you're so cold.

71
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,747
×ÖÄ»
I just got out of the dairy case.

72
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,079
×ÖÄ»
Come see my latest improvement to the bodega!

73
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:58,079
×ÖÄ»
I organized the money so all the presidents

74
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,998
×ÖÄ»
face the same way.

75
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:00,414

You're such a business man.

76
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:02,622

Thanks, but it took me so long,

77
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,497

now I have to work until 5:00.

I hope you love it as much as I do.

81

I'm sure I will.

82
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:13,079

I'm a city girl at heart.

83
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,872
×ÖÄ»
Babe? Can you let me out?

84
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,079
×ÖÄ»
I was trying to get you a soda!

85
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,914
×ÖÄ»
Oh, no, no, no, no!

86

Yes, I still own you.

90
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,079
×ÖÄ»
- Wanna play again? - Maybe later.

91
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,079
×ÖÄ»
Let's go see the city.

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,163
×ÖÄ»
Ah, there's nothing to see.

93
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:34,497
×ÖÄ»
Just a bunch of tall buildings and smelly subway cars.

94
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:37,455
×ÖÄ»
Oh, honey, there's much more to the city than that.

95
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:41,079
×ÖÄ»
You should definitely show Lincoln around.

96
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,079
×ÖÄ»
Do it, mija. You know we're just gonna stare

97
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,914
×ÖÄ»
at you until you agree.

98
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,872
×ÖÄ»
Ugh. Fine.

Wow, this is literally the city girl look

×ÖÄ»
I can't believe you have all this.

103
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:01,455

×ÖÄ»
you pretty much have anything.

105

Lori, my dove, allow me to be your guide today.

107

109
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:19,079
×ÖÄ»
Oh, fancy words from someone with a pudding moustache.

110
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,831
×ÖÄ»
That's very sweet, Carl.

111
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:23,080
×ÖÄ»
But I think I can manage on my own.

112
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,079
×ÖÄ»
I understand.

113
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,706

Ugh! Thank you for ruining my vibe.

117
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,831

And there's a building, and another building.

118
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:40,080
×ÖÄ»
And, ooh, an even taller building.

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,789
×ÖÄ»
Whew, good tour.

120
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:44,706
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Ronnie Anne!

126
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:01,706
×ÖÄ»
Actually, no.

127
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:04,122
×ÖÄ»
I'm Casey, that's Sameer, and that's Nikki.

'Sup? How do you know Santiago?

×ÖÄ»
Uh, Linc's a part of my rough and tumble past.

130
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,080
×ÖÄ»
Ha! The only thing rough and tumble

131
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,622
×ÖÄ»
was that church carnival ride

132
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,872
×ÖÄ»
that made us puke up our cotton candy.

133
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:15,747
×ÖÄ»
We should get going.

You guys want to hang with us?

Out of my way.

- Watch it! - You watch out!

139
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,079
×ÖÄ»
Excuse me!

140
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:40,330

Ah! These pigeons are crazy!

146
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,747

Aren't they just as crazy uptown?

147
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,163
×ÖÄ»
What do you mean? I'm not from

148
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,747
×ÖÄ»
Uh, you looked hot!

149
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,079
×ÖÄ»
Okay. Two stops to 45th Street.

150
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,330
×ÖÄ»
This is an express train to 250th Street.

151
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,747
×ÖÄ»
Wait, what?

152
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,079
×ÖÄ»
Welcome to the top deck.

153
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,080
×ÖÄ»
Don't forget your complimentary souvenir photo on the way out.

154
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,956
×ÖÄ»
This view is amazing!

155
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:24,289
×ÖÄ»
Our tallest building doesn't come close to this

156
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,330
×ÖÄ»
but it does provide a great view

157
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,079
×ÖÄ»
of my friend Liam's chicken farm.

158
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,039
×ÖÄ»
I've never heard of a chicken farm in the city.

159
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,914
×ÖÄ»
- I don't live in the ci-- - Oh, look! A blimp!

160
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,163
×ÖÄ»
Ah, you missed it.

161
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:41,079
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Ronnie Anne, it's pretty cold up here.

162
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,372
×ÖÄ»
Don't you want to put your sweatshirt on?

163
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:46,039
×ÖÄ»
- No, I'm good. - Then can I borrow it?

164
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,706
×ÖÄ»
- I'm cold. - No, you're good too.

165
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:49,455
×ÖÄ»
Just let me borrow it.

166
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:52,079
×ÖÄ»
Hey, what's your problem?

167
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:53,122
×ÖÄ»
I know what's going on.

168
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:56,079
×ÖÄ»
You lied to your friends and told them you're from uptown

169
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,079
×ÖÄ»
instead of Royal Woods!

170
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,079
×ÖÄ»
What? That's ridiculous!

171
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,998
×ÖÄ»
I'm not dumb.

172
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:02,789
×ÖÄ»
Are you embarrassed about being from Royal Woods?

173
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:03,872
×ÖÄ»
Just drop it, Lincoln.

174
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:05,079
×ÖÄ»
Well, you can do what you want.

175
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,372
×ÖÄ»
But I'm not lying about where I'm from.

176
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,079
×ÖÄ»
Why do you have to mess everything up for me?

177
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,706
×ÖÄ»
I didn't ask you to come here in the first place.

178
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,247
×ÖÄ»
You're right, so maybe I'll just go,

179
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:21,205
×ÖÄ»
right after I take my complimentary souvenir photo.

180
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,914
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

181
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:27,789
×ÖÄ»
I'm still a city girl.

182
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,414
×ÖÄ»
I can find my way back!

183
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:39,163
×ÖÄ»
Hey, everyone, I just remembered I need to go home.

184
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:42,998
×ÖÄ»
So I'm gonna pack.

185
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:48,831
×ÖÄ»
Babe, are you okay?

186
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:49,539
×ÖÄ»
Where's Lincoln?

187
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:52,079
×ÖÄ»
He's packing. What's going on?

188
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:03,998
×ÖÄ»
I did something dumb.

189
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:56,079
×ÖÄ»
What happened out there today?

190
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,079
×ÖÄ»
Must be pirates.

191
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,163
×ÖÄ»
Come on, we need to get to the bottom of this!

192
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:04,079
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry, Boo Boo Bear.

193
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,914
×ÖÄ»
There's just no way I can live in the city.

194
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:08,914
×ÖÄ»
But what about our plans?

195
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,998
×ÖÄ»
We're supposed to go to college here together.

196
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:15,289
×ÖÄ»
That was before I fell in a manhole!

197
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:17,497
×ÖÄ»
Aw, babe.

198
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:19,372
×ÖÄ»
When I first got here, I walked right

199
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,163
×ÖÄ»
into the back end of a police horse.

200
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,998
×ÖÄ»
Lucky for me, he hadn't eaten lunch yet.

201
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,039
×ÖÄ»
Life isn't always easy here.

202
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,079
×ÖÄ»
But once you get the hang of it,

203
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:33,414
×ÖÄ»
it's really great, and I know you're gonna love it.

204
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:34,581
×ÖÄ»
Thanks, Bobby.

205
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,079
×ÖÄ»
I feel a lot better.

206
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,414
×ÖÄ»
Lincoln, you can't leave.

207
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,163
×ÖÄ»
I didn't mean what I said before.

208
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:43,080
×ÖÄ»
I do want you here.

209
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,079
×ÖÄ»
I just don't understand why you don't want your friends

210
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,039
×ÖÄ»
to know you're from Royal Woods.

211
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,872
×ÖÄ»
I don't know.

212
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,414
×ÖÄ»
I guess I wanted them to think I was a city kid

213
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:51,998
×ÖÄ»
so they'd want to hang out with me.

214
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:54,039
×ÖÄ»
Well, if they're really your friends,

215
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,497
×ÖÄ»
they'll like you for who you are,

216
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:57,455
×ÖÄ»
not where you're from.

217
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,080
×ÖÄ»
Guess you're right.

218
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,079
×ÖÄ»
Thanks, lame-o.

219
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,079
×ÖÄ»
Come on, we need a do-over of today.

220
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:06,079
×ÖÄ»
Just doing our weekly door inspection.

221
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,455
×ÖÄ»
This one fails!

222
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:11,080
×ÖÄ»
Can we start with a re-do of my complimentary photo?

223
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,497
×ÖÄ»
It didn't come out that great.

224
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:18,080
×ÖÄ»
Sure, but let me take care of something first.

225
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,163
×ÖÄ»
Hey, can I talk to you guys?

226
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,455
×ÖÄ»
Um, I haven't been honest with you.

227
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,414
×ÖÄ»
I'm not from the city.

228
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,079
×ÖÄ»
I'm from a small town called Royal Woods.

229
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,414
×ÖÄ»
Both of us are.

230
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:29,247
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry I lied.

231
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,581
×ÖÄ»
I get it if you don't want to hang out anymore.

232
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:34,163
×ÖÄ»
Of course we want to hang with you.

233
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:38,079
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, we don't care. I mean, I'm from Kansas!

234
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,330
×ÖÄ»
Wait, what?

235
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,539
×ÖÄ»
I'm just messing with you.

236
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,039
×ÖÄ»
Hey, let's get something to eat.

237
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,205
×ÖÄ»
I'm suddenly craving garlic knots.

238
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,163
×ÖÄ»
Oh, man. Let me see that photo one more time.

239
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:54,163
×ÖÄ»
Well, this one didn't come out much better.

240
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:57,956
×ÖÄ»
I guess you'll just have to come back and visit again.

241
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,079
×ÖÄ»
Thanks for the pep talk, Boo Boo Bear.

242
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,872
×ÖÄ»
I'm excited to be a city girl again.

243
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,205
×ÖÄ»
Hey! That's my van!

244
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,079
×ÖÄ»
Come back!

245
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,872
×ÖÄ»
Babe, watch out for horse butts!
