1
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:57,275
鱼女士
Hey, Mrs. Fishman.

2
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:59,002
我们不是说好在鱼宝宝们孵化出来之前
Didn't we talk about you staying off your feet

3
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,541
你们都要在原地保护他们吗
until the babies are born?

4
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,166
你们应该在你们
You should be relaxing--

5
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,749
新的海带床上好好休息
in your new kelp bed!

6
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:07,950
我差点忘了  得更新一下路牌了
Oh, almost forgot-- gotta update my sign.

7
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,745
我们把它改成  “鱼先生一家的池塘”
Let's change this to, "Fishmans' Pond,

8
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,398
“数量”
"Population..."

9
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,919
等等再问一次  你们要生多少个小家伙
Wait, how many little ones are you having, again?

10
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:19,946
我们取整数到一百吧
Uh, let's just round it off to 100.

11
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,165
那就是一百零二
So that makes 102.

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,158
罗亚尔森林是个对大家庭来说的一个好地方
Royal Woods is a great place for big families.

13
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:27,301
你们会在这里生活得很开心的
You guys are gonna be really happy here.

14
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:32,642
伙计  你在干什么
Hey! What's your problem, pal?

15
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,725
让开  小屁孩  这块地已经被卖给
Beat it, kid. This land got sold

16
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:36,065
“芥末仓库”了
to "The Mustard Warehouse."

17
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:37,553
他们要在这里开家新店
They're building a new store here.

18
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,996
今天我接到命令把这个池塘填平
I got orders to fill in this pond today.

19
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:41,268
你不能这么做
You can't do that!

20
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,875
这里可是鱼先生一家住的地方
This is the Fishmans' home!

21
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,848
听着  如果他们有什么问题  他们可以打电话给律师
Look, if they got a problem, they can call a lawyer.

22
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:47,646
他们用不了电话
They can't use the phone.

23
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:51,305
拜托  孩子
Aww, come on, kid.

24
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:53,048
没人在乎没人在乎几条鱼
No one cares about a couple of fish.

25
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:54,547
把它们放进一辆坦克拉走吧
Put 'em in a tank or something.

26
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,063
如果我转移了鱼爸爸鱼妈妈  我也得转移它们的卵
If I move the parents, I'd have to move their eggs,

27
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:58,299
然后它们会死的
and they could die.

28
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,746
我还能说什么呢  孩子
What can I tell ya, kid?

29
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:02,886
海里其他的鱼多了去了
There's plenty of other fish in the sea.

30
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:04,494
现在快走开
Now move.

31
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:09,026
等等  伙计  你的鞋带松了
Wait, buddy! Your shoe's untied!

32
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,173
什么  好吧
Huh? Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,903
跳跳  拆掉螺栓
Hops, bolt removal.

34
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:15,711
向下  绕一圈  穿过去
Under, around, and through.

35
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:18,743
一只小兔子  拉一拉  再穿过
Meet Mr. Bunny Rabbit, pull, and through.

36
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:23,774
哎呀它跳进你的奶酪汤里了
Oh, for crying into your pub cheese soup!

37
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:25,586
我明天再来解决
I'll deal with this tomorrow.

38
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:29,037
跳跳  好样的  这可以帮我们争取时间
Good job, Hops. That'll buy us a little time

39
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,254
来想一个解决方法了
to figure out a plan.

40
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,930
跳跳  一股汽油味啊
Hops! Diesel breath!

41
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,757
拉娜  你的鞋上全是泥
Lana! Muddy shoes!

42
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:42,522
还有裤子上  衣服上  头上也有
And pants, and shirt, and hat!

43
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:45,303
没时间换衣服了  我现在有个很棘手的事情
No time to change, I've got a crisis on my hands.

44
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:49,238
鱼先生一家要被赶出自己的家了
The Fishmans are getting kicked out of their home.

45
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:50,602
它们尝试过找律师了吗
Have they tried calling a lawyer?

46
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:51,787
它们是鱼啊
They're fish!

47
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:54,159
它们住在高木公园的池塘里
And they live in the pond at Tall Timbers park.

48
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,653
但现在一些蠢货想在那铺建游乐园和
But now some jerks want to pave paradise and--

49
00:02:56,653 --> 00:03:00,326
-建停车场  -不是的  一家“芥末仓库”
- Put up a parking lot? - No, a "Mustard Warehouse."

50
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:01,675
好吧  芥末仓库
Well, the Mustard Warehouse

51
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:03,834
可能会需要一个停车场
probably will have a parking lot.

52
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,471
我不能袖手旁观啊
I can't just stand by and watch this happen.

53
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:12,475
林恩  我觉得我们家出了一个积极分子
Lynn, I think we might have a little activist on our hands.

54
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:13,716
亲爱的  我们说不定能帮上什么忙
You know, we might be able to help, hun.

55
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:15,994
你妈妈和我都是我们这代人的积极分子
Your mother and I were quite the activists in our day.

56
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,994
我们团结起来解决了很多好的问题
We rallied for a ton of good causes.

57
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:21,357
女性同工同酬  减少碳排放
Equal pay for women,reduction in carbon emissions.

58
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:23,664
人们在工作场合佩戴普卡贝壳颈链的自由
The freedom to wear puka-shell chokers in the workplace.

59
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:25,596
-你懂的  许多大事  -那太好了
-You know, all the big stuff. - Great!

60
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:26,623
那么我需要做什么呢
So what do I need to do?

61
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,037
我想你成功率最高的办法
Well, I think your best bet

62
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:29,899
是起草一份请愿书
would be to draw up a petition.

63
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,337
可以啊  没问题
Okay, cool!

64
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,303
-请愿书是什么  -就是你挨家挨户
- What's a petition? - Well, you go door-to-door

65
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:35,997
尽可能的收集别人的签名
collecting as many signatures as you can.

66
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:38,779
你会需要电话号码  家庭住址和电子邮箱
You'll also need phone numbers, home addresses, and emails.

67
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:42,483
你会需要镇里一半人的签名
You'll need the signatures of half of the people in town,

68
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:45,053
大概是  一万个签名
which would about, mm, 10,000.

69
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,468
一万
10,000?

70
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:48,296
你们认真的吗
Is that even a real number?

71
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,573
好吧
Okay, fine.

72
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,209
然后工程就会停止吗
And then the construction will stop?

73
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,662
不  只是会推迟
No, it'll just be delayed

74
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:54,800
鉴于他们会举行一场公开听证会
while they call a public hearing.

75
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,470
之后呢  在听证会的时候  会有
Now, at the hearing, there has to be...

76
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,996
#%^#^($(^&^)@*%$.....

77
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,602
我的天  一万人的签名
Boy, 10,000 signatures.

78
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,528
这将是漫长的一天
This is gonna be a long day.

79
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,809
跳跳  我们最好在出发之前上下卫生间
Hops, we'd better pee before we go.

80
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,694
有怪兽
Monster!

81
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:16,995
酷  在哪儿
Cool, where?

82
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,358
我以后再也不会进那间卫生间了
I'm never going in that bathroom again!

83
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,065
跳跳  也许有另一个更简单的方法
You know, Hops, maybe there's an easier way

84
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,626
拯救鱼先生一家
to save the Fishmans.

85
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,528
说得对  不管怎么样我们是该去卫生间了
You're right, we should still pee anyway.

86
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,315
我的老天爷
Cheese and rice!（Jesus Christ!)

87
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,321
绝对没人会相信我
They're never gonna believe me!

88
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,868
我得赶紧离开这
I'm outta here!

89
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:23,392
亲爱的  你快来看啊
Hey, honey, come check this out.

90
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,141
他们在说你的池塘
They're talking about your pond.

91
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,384
凯瑟琳・马利根从高木公园
Katherine Mulligan coming to you live

92
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:28,777
为您现场报道
from Tall Timbers park.

93
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,437
在我身旁的是声称自己看到了
I'm here with the construction worker

94
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:33,723
所谓沼泽怪物的建筑工人
who claims to have seen an alleged swamp monster.

95
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:36,315
没错  凯瑟琳  它大概有20英尺高
That's right, Katherine.Had to be 20 feet tall,

96
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,231
几百磅  爪子像香蕉一样
couple hundred pounds,paws like a bunch of bananas.

97
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:40,409
你自己看吧
See for yourself.

98
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,074
他张牙舞爪咆哮着扑向我
He came at me with everything he had.

99
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:45,422
就是那时你尖叫着逃跑
And is that when you ran away screaming?

100
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:46,993
谁告诉你的
Wh--Who told you that?

101
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,225
难道是那个怪物吗
Was it the monster?

102
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,838
我刚刚得到最新的消息
I'm getting word that in light of this incident,

103

“芥末仓库”已经决定

104
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,472
在另一个地点建造新店了

105
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,191
你很幸运啊  孩子
Looks like you lucked out, kiddo.

106
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,559
即使你完全不需要它
Even though you didn't need it,

107
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,904
我们也为你愿意为请愿书付出努力  而感到骄傲
we're proud you were willing to put in the effort with that petition.

108
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:06,808

109
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:08,516
对哦  请愿书
Oh, right, the petition.

110
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:09,785
是啊  我离收集一万人的签名
Yeah, I was so close

111
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,025
已经快完成了
to getting those 10,000 signatures.

112
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,636
一万
10,000?

113
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:15,097
认真的吗
Is that even a real number?

114
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:17,568
-很显然啊  -我对于那只沼泽怪物
- Apparently. - Well, I'm just glad

115
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:20,163
不再出现在我们的卫生间里感到欣慰
that swamp monster isn't in our bathroom anymore.

116
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,722
亲爱的  你真了不起
That's terrific, sweetie.

117
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,188
跳跳  鱼先生一家看到奥兰斯的时候
Well, Hops, the Fishmans are gonna be pretty happy

118
00:06:26,188 --> 00:06:27,645
一定会很开心的
to see ol' Lans.

119
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,043
不是我在夸自己  但我真的救了它们的
Not to boast, but I did save their

120
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:34,926
-怪物在这里  -我要和怪物自拍一张
- Here, monster, monster. - I need a selfie with the monster.

121
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,248
快来买一件沼泽怪物的T恤
Get your swamp monster tees!

122
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:40,196
一件四刀  三件十五
One for $4, three for 15!

123
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:42,578
-这是什么情况  -凯瑟琳・马利根
- What's going on? - Katherine Mulligan,

124
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,888
从高木公园为您现场报道
coming to you live from Tall Timbers park.

125
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,213
看起来沼泽怪物
It appears the alleged swamp monster

126
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:49,426
把这个曾经沉睡的小村庄
has turned this once-sleepy hamlet

127
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,707
成为媒体关注的热点了
into a hotbed of media attention.

128
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,563
-你在和我说话啊  -是的
- Oh, you're talking to me. - Yes, I am.

129
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,794
你可以离开吗
And can you please move?

130
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,054
因为我们需要在这里建立直播帐篷
Because we need to set up our broadcasting tent.

131
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:03,369
小心点
Be careful!

132
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:05,211
这里有非常脆弱的鱼卵
There are delicate fish eggs over here,

133
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,767
它们需要清净
They need peace and quiet.

134
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,328
这个媒体热度要持续多久
How long is this whole media hot-sauce thing gonna last?

135
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:15,507
直到沼泽怪物决定收拾行囊离开这里
Until the swamp monster decides to pack up and leave.

136

138
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:20,998
我是凯瑟琳・马利根
I'm Katherine Mulligan.

139
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:25,359
你说的是收拾行囊离开  是吗
Pack up and leave, you say?

140
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,252
队友们  吓唬这些人我觉得不太好
Okay, gang. I feel kind of bad about scaring all these people,

141
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,311
但我们必须这样做
but we gotta do it

142
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:35,474
为了鱼先生一家
for the Fishmans.

143
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,982
我带了火腿和奶酪
So, I brought the ham and cheese.

144
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,889
-你带法式长棍了吗  -对不起
- Did you bring the baguette? - I'm sorry.

145
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,511
我不知道那是什么  所以我只带了面包
I didn't know what that was, so I just got bread.

146
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,239
是沼泽怪物
Swamp monster!

147
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,774
听着  团队  我是凯瑟琳・马利根

149
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:59,528
在矮灌木溪沼泽怪物
The swamp monster has been spotted

150
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:00,695
被发现了
in Short Shrub Creek.

151
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:03,524
凯瑟琳・马利根正在为您报道  我们快去那儿
This is Katherine Mulligan saying, "Let's get over there!

152
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,515
有人想搭便车吗
Anyone wanna give Flip a lift?

153
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:10,535
我可以给你一件打折的T恤
I'll give you a discount on a tee-shirt!

154
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:11,559
只要六块钱
Six bucks!

155
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,027
鱼先生一家  好消息
Fish fam! Great news!

156
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,210
我把那些吵吵嚷嚷的媒体们赶走了
I got those noisy TV people out of here

157
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,518
所以你们安静的抚养你们的宝宝了
so you can raise your babies in peace!

158
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:22,607
凯瑟琳・马利根从矮灌木溪为您现场报道
This is Katherine Mulligan, coming to you live

159
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,134
沼泽怪物最近从这里
from Short Shrub Creek, where the swamp monster

160
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,660
迁移到其他地方了
has recently relocated.

161
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,968
多亏了我们
Thanks to us.

162
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,304
这对“芥末仓库”来说是个坏消息
That's bad news for "The Mustard Warehouse,"

163
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,673
因为矮灌木河将成为
because Short Shrub Creek was going to be the site

164
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:35,957
-他们新店的位置  -等等  还有这回事
-of their new store. - Wait, it was?

165
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:38,875
好消息是  现在沼泽怪物
The good news is, now that Tall Timbers park

166
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,736
已经离开了高木公园  他们可以
is swamp monster free, they'll be able

167
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:41,971
再次搬回来那里了
to move back there.

168
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:43,796
建造工程明天开始启动
Construction starts tomorrow.

169
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:45,454
我是凯瑟琳・马利根
I'm Katherine Mulligan.

170
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:47,636
跳跳  我们都做了什么啊
Hops, what have we done?

171
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,805
他们又要回去伤害鱼先生一家了
They're going right back to the Fishmans!

172
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,834
跳跳  我当初就应该听爸爸妈妈的话
Oh, Hops, I should have listened to Mom and Dad

173
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,754
乖乖按正确的办法处理这件事
and done things the right way.

174
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:58,361
在他们把鱼先生家变成芥末之前
We still have time before they turn

175
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,136
我们还有一些时间
the Fishmans' home into mustard.

176
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:02,159
也许我们还能补救
Maybe we can still do this.

177
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:06,454
您好  格劳斯爷爷  我在收集签名
Hi, Mr. Grouse! I'm collecting signatures

178
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,847
去阻止“芥末仓库”
to stop "The Mustard Warehouse"

179
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,570
破坏鱼先生它们的家
from destroying the Fishmans' home.

180
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,089
鱼先生一家找律师了吗
Uh, did the Fishmans try calling a lawyer?

181
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:14,547
它们是鱼
They're fish.

182
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:17,902
反正芥末让我打喷嚏  我会签字的
Well, mustard gives me the toots, so I'll sign.

183
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:19,529
谢谢你*1
A-thank you.

184
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,056
谢谢你*2
A-thank you.

185
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:20,733
谢谢你*3

186
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:21,288
谢谢你*4
A-thank you.

187
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:21,894
谢谢你*5
A-thank you.

188
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,297
谢谢你*6
A-thank you.

189
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:23,023
谢谢你*7
A-thank you.

190
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:23,999
谢谢你*8
A-thank you.

191
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,035
你在这啊  亲爱的
There you are, honey.

192
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,640
我们从那个教什么来着的记者那里听说了
We heard from that reporter what's-her-name

193
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,855
他们又要开始铺设你的公园了
that they're back to paving your park again.

194
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:34,455
我知道  我在外面收集那一万个签名
I know, I was out trying to get those 10,000 signatures

195
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:35,572
来阻止他们
to stop them.

196
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:37,708
-进行的怎么样了  -不怎么样
- How'd it go? - Not great.

197
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,845
我觉得还差一千万吧
I came up about ten million short.

198
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:42,439
亲爱的  我很抱歉
I'm really sorry, sweetie,

199
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:44,240
但你已经尽你所能了
but you did everything you could.

200
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,176
其实我并没有
Well, no, I actually didn't.

201
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:50,025
我想着走捷径却把事情搞得更糟
I tried to take a shortcut and made things worse.

202
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,379
当我决定做正确的事情时
And by the time I decided to do it the right way,

203
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,947
我已经太迟了
I was too late.

204
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:55,839
我们仍然为你的勇敢对抗
Well, we're still proud that you stood up

205
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,106
还有你的信念感到骄傲
for what you believed in.

206
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:59,931
好吧  但这些对鱼先生一家都没多大用处
Yeah, but that doesn't do much for the Fishmans.

207
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,884
它们还是会失去自己的家
They're still going to lose their home.

208
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:07,664
等待一个众所周知的时刻（***这句不确定）
Wait a proverbial ding-dang moment.

209
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,852
丽萨  如果你要告诉我去找律师
Lisa, if you tell me to call a lawyer,

210
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:10,885
-我就要  -不  不  不
-I'm going to-- - No, no, no.

211
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:13,186
你不需要一个律师或者签名
You don't need a lawyer or signatures.

212
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:16,251
鱼先生一家  就像你提到的
The Fishmans, as you so charmingly refer to them,

213
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:19,290
实际上是湖鲟
are actually Acipenser Fulvenscens.

214
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,130
别称：湖鲟
Street name: lake sturgeon.

215
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,091
鱼先生一家是医生
The Fishmans are doctors?

216
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,613
不是“手术”  兰妮  是“鲟鱼”
Not "Surgeon," Leni, "Sturgeon. "

217
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:30,209
它们濒临灭绝  因此受到保护
Which are endangered, and therefore protected.

218
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,041
等等  你说的是
Wait, are you saying--

219
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,091
没有人能碰它们的栖息地
That nobody can touch their habitat.

220
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,754
-这是联邦法律  -太好了
- It's a Federal law. - Yes!

221
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:39,794
不知道你还记不记得  在1973次国会通过
As you may recall, in 1973 Congress passed...

222
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:43,799
#%^#^($(^&^).....

223
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,900
露娜  我在说话呢
Luna, I'm trying to speak, here.

224
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:50,906
听到了吗  鱼先生
See that, Fishmans?

225
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:53,203
你门现在是联邦保护的
You are now federally protected,

226
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,494
这意味着没有人可以捣鼓你们的家
which means no one can mess with your home.

227
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,937
是鱼宝宝  拉娜阿姨和跳跳叔叔
Fish babies! Aunt Lana and Uncle Hops

228
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:00,206
来照顾你们了
are here to babysit!

229
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,711
你们玩得开心
You guys enjoy yourselves.

230
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:02,758
谢谢你
A-thank you.

231
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:06,194
你确定这是个好主意吗
Are you sure this is a good idea?

232
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,654
拜托了  兰妮  
Oh, Leni, come on.

233
00:11:07,654 --> 00:11:10,370
那个谁在新闻里说了沼泽怪物
W--what's-her-name from the news said there hasn't

234
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,403
已经消失了很多天了
been a swamp monster sighting in days!

235
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,078
好吧  我也觉得
Okay, I guess.

1
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,114
"好的  艾思  我们已经把嫌疑人
"Well, Ace, we've narrowed down

2
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,063
范围缩小到了
"The suspects to...

3
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:41,517
"牌鲨"  "蛇眼"
"'The Card Shark,' 'Snake Eyes,'

4
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,053
和"老阿姨"  可是是谁
"And 'The Old Maid, but which one made off

5
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,904
带着黄金逃出生天呢
"With the golden die?"

6
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,443
答案就像你脸上的胡子
"It's as clear as the mustache

7
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:48,873
一样明显  杰克
"On your face, Jack!

8
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,489
只有这之中的恶棍才会做这样的事
"Only one of these villains could have done the deed--

9
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:52,719
那就是
"And that is..."

10
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:54,384
我的钱在"牌鲨"身上
My money's on "The Card Shark."

11
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:55,950
又是他  这个人都不眨眼
Same. The guy never blinks.

12
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:57,336
根本都信不过的
You just can't trust him.

13
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:58,349
好吧  我们来看看
Okay, let's see.

14
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:00,446
出来啦
Boom! Nailed it!

15
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:02,738
我们一次性解决了五个案子了
We just solved our fifth case in a row.

16
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,440
五连胜
We're on a hot streak!

17
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:08,762
你好呀  兰妮
Hey, Leni.

18
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:10,746
工作怎么样
How was work?

19
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,982
-糟透了  -怎么了
- Terrible! - What happened?

20
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,251
我以为商店的活儿还挺不错的
I thought things were going great at the store.

21
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,619
是挺不错的
They were!

22
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,744
直到这个下午
Until this afternoon.

23
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,291
收据已经放在包里了  还附赠了我们的新品
Your receipt's in the bag, along with some samples

24
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,791
香水小样"糖果饼干阳光"
of our new scent: "Sugar Cookie Sunshine."

25
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,648
这条裙子很适合你
That skirt would look great on you.

26
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,702
还可以穿成可爱的小披肩样式
And it also makes a cute poncho!

27
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,354
你改变了我的一生
You just changed my life!

28
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,975
兰妮
Uh, Leni?

29
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,060
你好呀  卡米高太太
Hi, Mrs. Carmichael!

30
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,667
每月清点进行得怎么样了
How's the monthly inventory going?

31
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:39,921
不怎么样
Not great.

32
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:42,175
有几条围巾不见了
Several scarves have gone missing.

33
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,792
-你能跟我走一趟吗  -我们这是在玩
- Can you come with me? - Are we going

34
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,191
寻宝游戏吗
on a scavenger hunt?

35
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,896
根本就不是什么寻宝游戏
There was no scavenger hunt.

36
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:51,617
她觉得是我偷了围巾
She thinks I stole the scarves!

37
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,951
什么  她为什么这么想
What? Why would she think that?

38
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,025
它们都是我的部门里的
They were all from my department,

39
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:57,293
而且它们都是我来的这个月
and they all went missing in the month

40
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,662
不见的  所以她说
that I've worked there, so she said

41
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:00,930
她必须得让我走
she had to let me go.

42
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,832
我说  "上哪儿去"
And I said, "Go where?"

43
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,602
她说  "我是说你被炒了"
And she said, "That means you're fired!"

44
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,375
这也太不公平了
That is so unfair.

45
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,276
兰妮从来不会偷任何东西
Leni would never steal anything.

46
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,746
这比疯狂八人组在堆积的行李舱
This is worse than the time Crazy 8 was falsely accused

47
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:17,809
被错判那次还要糟糕
of stacking the deck.

48
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,983
要是能有人帮忙
If only there was someone

49
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:20,853
还兰妮一个清白就好了
who could help clear Leni's name.

50
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,986
你是说像我们这样的
You mean like us?

51
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,690
林肯  我知道我们的制服确实很酷炫
Lincoln, I know we have these amazingly accurate uniforms,

52
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,425
但我们只是11岁小男孩啊
but we're just 11-year-old boys.

53
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,182
刚刚完成破案五连胜的
11-year-old boys who just solved

54
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,762
十一岁男孩
their fifth case in a row.

55
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,864
我们要伸张正义了
We're ready to deal out some justice.

56
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:37,199
妈呀  你刚才听着跟艾思一样
Wow, you just sounded like Ace.

57
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,869
要是我有汗毛  肯定都要立起来了
If I had hair on my arms, it would be standing up.

58
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,911
挺适合秋天呢
So cute for fall.

59
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,913
杰克呼叫艾思  迷你包包附近
Jack to Ace: No suspects sighted

60
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,548
没有发现嫌疑人  完毕
by the mini-backpacks, over.

61
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:55,518
重复  没有嫌疑人在  
Copy, no suspects by the-- whoa!

62
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,287
好帅的演出服  我也想演超级英雄  
Cool costume. I'm playing superheroes, too!

63
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,122
想看看我的据点吗
Wanna see my hideout?

64
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:03,326
其实  这不是演出服  这是制服
Actually, this isn't a costume, it's a uniform.

65
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:06,228
我也不是在演  我在调查
And I'm not playing, I'm investigating.

66
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,410
你的父母呢
Where are your parents?

67
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:11,000
我妈也很忙  不能玩
My mom's too busy to play, too.

68
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,268
艾思
Ace!

69
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:13,936
嫌疑人在围巾附近了
Suspect spotted by the scarves,

70
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,404
你绝对想不到是谁
and you won't believe who it is.

71
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,040
抱歉  小孩  要去忙公务了
Sorry, kid, gotta follow this lead.

72
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,380
盖比  不可能是她啊
Gabby? It can't be her.

73
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,782
她还在健身房借了我她的防护镜呢
She lent me her safety goggles in gym.

74
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,328
就是她  快跟上
It's totally her. Come on!

75
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:41,063
我知道我会有麻烦但是
Oh, I know I'm gonna get in trouble but...

76
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,868
站那儿别动
Hold it right there!

77
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,704
盖比  你已经有一衣柜的围巾了
Gabby, you already have a closet full of scarves.

78
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,006
妈妈  求你了
Mom, please!

79
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:51,507
让我买下来吧
Just let me buy it!

80
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,210
-我有礼品券的  -你阿姨给你礼品券
- I have a gift card. - Your aunt gave you that

81
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,745
是为了让你买一双合适的鞋子
for a sensible pair of shoes.

82
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,902
现在把围巾放回去
Now put that scarf back.

83
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,116
克莱德  林肯
Clyde? Lincoln?

84
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,353
你们在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here? 

85
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,719
你知道嘛  就是买些
Oh, you know, just shopping for some--

86
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,655
少女胸罩吗
Training bras?

87
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,882
你们知道把这些
Ugh. Do you have any idea

88
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:10,853
放回衣架上有多麻烦吗
how hard these things are to put back on hangers?

89
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,362
对不起  我们来整理好
Uh, sorry. We'll clean it up.

90
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,032
我来收集这些  物件
I'll just gather these, uh, items.

91
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:18,067
我的罪恶之眼
Ah! My crime eye!

92
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,605
好的  下次我们要更加小心了
Okay, so we'll be more careful next time.

93
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,541
除非是及其可疑  否则都不能被定成嫌疑人
No one's a suspect unless they're extremely suspicious.

94
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:29,045
比如说  一个长辈在青少年专柜这样
Like, say, a senior in the junior's department?

95
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,546
小摩托
Scoots!

96
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:33,249
我们都知道她在商场监狱待过一阵子
We know she's done some hard time in mall jail.

97
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:34,950
她可能是想给她的保释官
Maybe she's just here to buy a gift

98
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,053
买个礼物
for her parole officer.

99
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,293
那她为什么要进试衣间呢
Then why is she going into the fitting room?

100
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,761
你说的没错
You're right.

101
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:46,638
她可能是想进去
She's probably going in there

102
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,384
偷偷把围巾藏在包里
so she can stash the scarf in her bag.

103
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,032
-去抓她  -等等
- Let's get her! - Wait!

104
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:51,582
我们不能闯进更衣室去
We can't just barge into a fitting room.

105
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,235
该死  你说得对
Dang it, you're right.

106
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,589
我们得在她出来的时候拦住她
We need a way to stop her on the way out.

107
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:57,873
-我知道了  -路障
- Oh, I've got it. - Spike strip!

108
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:02,111
我们看她怎么穿过这些
Let's see her try to scoot over these.

109
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,412
是啊
Yeah.

110
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,214
他们会叫她停下的
They'll have to start calling her "Stops."

111
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,500
让一让  老娘托加派对要迟到了
Make way! Mama's late for a toga party.

112
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,998
我觉得我们又错过了
Uh oh, I think we messed up again.

113
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,490
小停停太太  摩一托  我是说
Mrs. Stops, scoot! I mean--

114
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:14,747
小摩托太太  停一停
Mrs. Scoot, stop!

115
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,588
20块给你了  不要小票
Here's your 20 bucks, I don't need a receipt.

116
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:19,762
哇啊~!
Who~a!

117
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,686
我陪  记我账上
My "B"! Put it on my tab!

118
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,026
认真的吗  又是你俩
Seriously? You two again?

119
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,585
对不起  我们来收拾好
Sorry, we'll clean this up.

120
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,424
出去
Get out!

121
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,958
好了  现在我们胜零负二 
Okay, so we're 0 for 2, 

122
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,348
而且艾思和杰克
but I'm sure Ace and Jack

123
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,950
在他们的职业生涯里
have made a few false accusations

124
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:42,385
绝对很少有错判  -肯定的
in their careers. - Totally.

125
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:43,918
还记得那次吗  他解决的他和
Remember that lawsuit they had to settle

126
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,144
"假面侠"的诉讼
with "The Bluffer"?

127
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,806
我们得更加谨慎
We just have to be more careful

128
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,058
-不要急于求成  -没错
not to jump to conclusions. - Right.

129
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,522
那如果我们看到有个人捂着装有蓝色面料的包
And if we see someone walking quickly away from the store

130
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,229
快速走过的时候
clutching a bag with blue fabric

131
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,231
-我们就跟紧  -没错
sticking out of it. - Exactly.

132
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,074
等下  什么
Wait, what?

133
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:59,835
菲奥娜
both: Fiona!

134
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,470
这就完全说得通了
It makes perfect sense.

135
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,169
这就是她把我们赶出商店的原因
That's why she threw us out of the store--

136
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,740
她不想让我们挡了她的道
she didn't want us on her trail.

137
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,043
来吧  艾思  我们去搞定那个王炸
Come on, Ace. Let's go deal with this joker.

138
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,211
等等  牌局里还需要
Wait. We need one more player

139
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:09,741
多一个玩家
at the table.

140
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,250
你回来了
You're back!

141
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:15,750
还带来了你的伙伴
And you brought your sidekick!

142
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,286
什么玩意儿
Uh, excuse me?

143
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:18,587
我们是搭档
We're partners.

144
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:20,856
我们能一起演超级英雄吗
Can we all play superheroes now?

145
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:22,124
抱歉  我们不能
Sorry, we can't.

146
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,959
我们要办个案子
We're about to crack a case.

147
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,165
她在那儿
There she is!

148
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,068
卡米高太太
Mrs. Carmichael?

149
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:32,682
我们能证明兰妮没有偷围巾
We can prove that Leni didn't steal those scarves.

150
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,438
你们是谁
Uh, who are you?

151
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,323
显然  我们是侦探
Clearly, we're detectives.

152
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,722
我们目前已经破了五个案子了
Here are five cases we've previously cracked.

153
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,190
拜托跟我们来  没有时间了
Please just come with us. There's not much time!

154
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,159
停下  菲奥娜
Stop right there, Fiona!

155
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,723
-把箱子打开  -什么  为什么
- Open the trunk. - What? Why?

156
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,792
-我才不会呢  -我想你最好还是打开
- I--I'm not doing that. - I think you better.

157
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,300
好吧  你逮到我了
Okay, you caught me.

158
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,531
卡米高太太  我想你会发现这个包里
Mrs. Carmichael, I think you'll find

159
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,868
藏有至少一条蓝色的
this bag contains at least one blue--

160
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,436
裙子
Dress? Huh?

161
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,238
是了  我下班的时候在
Yep. I bought this at Stader's

162
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,073
斯塔德家买的  对不起  C太太
after my shift. Sorry, Mrs. C.

163
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,109
我知道我们不能在对家买东西
I know we're not supposed to shop at our competitors,

164
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,077
但它太划算了
but it was such a good deal.

165
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,613
好吧  我不说我可以保证  但是
Well, I can't say that I approve, bu--

166
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,357
妈呀  这是在白送啊
Wow, they are giving this away.

167
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,219
他们家有12码的吗
Do they have it in a 12?

168
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,154
菲奥娜
Um, Fiona?

169
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,223
我们很抱歉错怪了你
We're really sorry for accusing you.

170
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,425
侦探界难免出些这种事儿
These things sometimes happen in detective work.

171
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:31,160
中头彩之前
You're bound to play a few bad hands

172
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,162
难免失手几次
before you win the jackpot.

173
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,031
没事儿  我走了哈
Whatever. I'm leaving now.

174
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:37,843
夫人  我们搞错了
Well, ma'am, we've made a mistake.

175
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:39,769
但别担心  在我们抓到小偷之前
But don't worry, we're not giving up

176
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,604
我们不会放弃的
until we find the real shoplifter.

177
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,539
我们如果能看看你的员工档案
It would really help if we could have access

178
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,179
和顾客邮件列表会对我们有很大帮助的
to your private employee files and customer mailing list.

179
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,277
听着  我很感谢
Look, I appreciate

180
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,845
你们为兰妮做的事儿
what you're trying to do for Leni,

181
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:52,143
但我也不想两个穿着演出服的小孩
but I don't need two kids in costumes

182
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:53,504
打扰我的商店
disrupting my store.

183
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,851
麻烦你们  别掺和了
Now, please, just stay out.

184
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,125
再给我们一次机会吧
Give us another chance!

185
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,622
艾思和杰克伸张正义
Ace and Jack can't rest

186
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:01,791
可不能罢休啊
until they've done found some justice!

187
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,295
我很难过  克莱德
I feel terrible, Clyde.

188
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,930
我们让让兰妮失望了  现在她
We failed Leni, and now she'll never

189
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:08,888
永远不会再被录用了
get her job back.

190
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,738
我只是不懂我们是怎么搞砸的
I just don't know how we got it so wrong.

191
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:12,635
会不会是读漫画书
Is it possible reading comic books

192
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:14,518
并不能让我们成为好的侦探
doesn't make you a good detective?

193
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,772
我觉得是这样
I guess it's possible.

194
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,009
可能我们真的只是两个穿着演出服的小孩吧
Maybe we really are just two kids in costumes.

195
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,544
你说得对
You're right.

196
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,409
这可有点疼了
Ow. That wasn't a good idea.

197
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:26,849
你们好啊
Oh, hey you guys.

198
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,418
别管我  我就想找点儿东西叠一叠
Don't mind me, I'm just looking for stuff to fold.

199
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:30,567
我真的很怀念这种感觉
I really miss it.

200
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,288
我能叠这个吗
Oh, can I fold this?

201
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,456
可以的
You can have it.

202
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:34,857
我不会再穿披风了
I'm done wearing capes.

203
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,987
这不一定要当作披风啊
Well, it doesn't have to be a cape.

204
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:38,561
你可以把它当成围巾带着
You could wear it as a scarf, too.

205
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,596
等等  你刚才是说"围巾"吗
Wait, did you just say "Scarf"?

206
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:42,539
你说得对  我想什么呢
You're right. What was I thinking?

207
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,870
季节不合适  兰妮
Wrong season, Leni.

208
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,510
要不然改成沙滩裙呢 
How about a beach cover-up? 

209
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,696
不 不  "围巾"
No, no, "Scarf!"

210
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:48,838
克莱德  就是这样了
Clyde, that's it!

211
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:50,606
如果披风可以变成围巾
If a cape can be a scarf--

212
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:52,871
那么围巾也可以变成披风
Then a scarf can be a cape.

213
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,877
我想我知道罪魁祸首是谁了
I think I know who the culprit is.

214
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,114
我也是
So do I.

215
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:57,493
兰妮  我能把那个要回来吗
Leni, can I have that back?

216
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,949
我们要破案了
We have a crime to solve.

217
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:00,574
去沙滩吗
At the beach?

218
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,790
好的  我们分头行动
Okay, let's split up.

219
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,485
你去配件区找
You look in the accessories section,

220
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:10,631
我去鞋区探察
I'll cover the shoes.

221
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:14,530
我记得我跟你们说过离我的商店远点儿
I thought I told you to stay out of my store.

222
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:16,499
别担心  女士  我们马上就走
Don't worry, ma'am, we'll be gone in a minute.

223
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,200
我们只需要和你儿子谈谈
We just need to talk to your son.

224
00:20:18,234 --> 00:20:19,327
我儿子
My son?

225
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,638
你们回来了  你的胡子歪了
You're back! Your mustache is crooked.

226
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:24,373
你还想玩超级英雄
Hey! Any chance you still want

227
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,275
-的游戏吗  -想啊
to play superheroes? - Yeah!

228
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,810
给你们看看我的据点
I'll show you my hideout!

229
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,512
据点  什么据点
Hideout? What hideout?

230
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:31,247
我觉得我们最好一起去看看
I think we all should go see it.

231
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,449
尤其是您  卡米高女士
Especially you, Mrs. Carmichael.

232
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:34,458
好吧
Ugh, fine.

233
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:36,659
但是你们这些孩子又是来浪费我的时间的
But if you boys are wasting my time again,

234
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,217
我会禁止你们在十八岁以前
I will have you banned from the mall

235
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:40,528
-进入商店  -不能买酸奶了
until you're 18. - No more fro-yo?

236
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,625
不能去漫画书店了
No more comic book store?

237
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,160
你最好是想对了  林肯
You'd better be right, Lincoln.

238
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,062
这个代价太高了
The stakes are high.

239
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:50,204
这里就是我的据点
So here's my hideout.

240
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,901
等等  等我先
Wait! Let me just

241
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,011
输个密码
put in the password.

242
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,076
围巾在这儿
The scarves!

243
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:07,185
妈妈  它们是超英披风
Mom, they're superhero capes.

244
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,253
我一直都搞错了
I had it all wrong.

245
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,531
谢谢了  男孩儿们
Thank you, boys.

246
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,803
没事的  女士
No problem, ma'am.

247
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:18,273
我觉得你可以说正义就在眼前
I guess you could say justice was in the cards.

248
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:24,966
上衣真可爱
Cute top!

249
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,636
你知道它还能改造成
And did you know you can also wear it

250
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,735
铅笔裙吗
as a pencil skirt?

251
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:30,890
兰妮  我都不知道该怎么为
Oh, Leni, I can't apologize enough

252
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,731
我误解你偷了围巾而道歉才好了
for accusing you of stealing those scarves.

253
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,145
我能怎样补偿你吗
Is there any way I can make it up to you?

254
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,479
有什么毛衣给我叠叠的吗
Are there any sweaters I can fold?

255
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,799
嗨  朋友们
Hey, you guys!

256
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:44,336
谢谢你们帮我找回了工作
Thank you so much for getting my job back.

257
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,982
我告诉了商店的每一个人
I've been telling everyone at the mall

258
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:48,025
你们是多棒的侦探
what totes amazing detectives you are.

259
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,979
我们知道  我们刚接到一个宠物店的
We know! We just got a new case

260
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,461
-新案子  -有只变色龙丢了
at the pet store. - A chameleon's gone missing.

261
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,330
他们觉得它丢了  它太难被发现了
They think. He's really hard to see,

262
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,965
所以很可能它其实就在笼子里
so it's possible he's just in his cage.

263
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:58,134
要说谁能破这个案子
Well, if anyone can solve the case,

264
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,137
那就肯定是黑美人和独臂乔了
it's Blake Saucy and One-Arm-Joe.

265
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:02,571
很接近了
Eh, close enough.

266
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,607
准备好去伸张正义了吗
Ready to deal out some justice?

267
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,679
你们来搞笑的吗
Seriously?
