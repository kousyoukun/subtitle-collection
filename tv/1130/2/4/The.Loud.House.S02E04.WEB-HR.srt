at your house

525
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:24,586
and it seemed kinda cool,
so I thought I'd give it a try.

526
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,061
Anyway--

527
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,493
- Oops.

528
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,394
- Wha--what happened?

529
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,995
- Uh, you fainted and
broke our solar system.

530
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:33,699
- Aw, man!

531
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,570
- That's okay.
We can fix it at my house.

532
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,099
I have an extra Jupiter.

533
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:38,874
- Your house?

534
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,841
- Well, our project isn't
any safer here.

535
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:42,941
- I guess you're right.

536
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,712
Come on, Rock,
let's roll!

537
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,854
- Done.
Form a protective perimeter.

538
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:56,186
- Hey, Rocky, grab us some sodas
from the kitchen, will ya?

539
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,830
- Ah.
Oh. Hi.

540
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,457
- Uh, hi.
You changed your hair back.

541
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,603
Yeah, the blonde
wasn't really me.

542
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,068
I was trying to be
regular and normal,

543
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,167
but I think I'm just
gonna be myself.

544
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,639
- I'm really glad
to hear that.

545
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,069
- Thanks.
Well, see you later.

546
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,774
Wait, you are?

547
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,806
But when we first met,
you kept running away.

548
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,612
I thought
I freaked you out.

549
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,884
- To be honest, I thought
you were too cool for me,

550
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:27,053
and I couldn't think
of anything to say,

551
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,523
so I just ran.

552
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,061
- Hey, uh,
my coffin collection's

553
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,458
in the basement.
Wanna check it out?

554
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,790
- Sure.
That'd be really fun.

555
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,225
As long as I don't
have to get in one.

556
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,501
- Deal.

557
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:45,166
- Can we stop?
I'm feeling faint.

558
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,501
Easy.

559
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:47,836
Ah!
Watch the pothole!

560
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,880
- It's okay, Rusty.
We spent all weekend on this,

561
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,507
we're not gonna
drop it now.

562
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,612
both: Hey, guys.
both: Ah!

563
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,146
- Phew!
Good save, man.

564
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,050
- Sorry we scared you.

565
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,021
- We just wanted to tell you
we nailed the fake blood recipe.

566
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,890
- We also threw in
a few popcorn kernels

567
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,060
for brain matter.

568
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,059
- Ah!

569
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,760
- Dang it.
