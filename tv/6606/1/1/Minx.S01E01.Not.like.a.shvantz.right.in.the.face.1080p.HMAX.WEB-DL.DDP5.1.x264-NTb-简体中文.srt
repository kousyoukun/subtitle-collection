杂志不会成的
the magazine's not working out,

153
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,270
我不明白你为什么还在坚持
and i don't get why you're still going.

154
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,640
你当然不明白了
no, of course you don't get it,

155
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,980
因为你写的那篇
because you rose through the ranks

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,400
关于千鸟格西装和窄翻领的文章
of a national magazine writing

157
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,060
在全国发行的杂志上脱颖而出

158
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,480
-好吧  -可我写的文章是政治性的
- okay. - but my stories are political.

159
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,440
没人想碰这种话题 所以我必须得自己做
no one wants to touch 'em, so i have to do it myself.

160
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,320
不 你不需要 把所有这些精力
no, you don't. just put all of that energy

161
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,740
投入到其他地方啊
into something else.

162
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,040
我们一起可以有很好的生活
we could have a great life together.

163
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,080
你是要让我选择吗
are you asking me to choose?

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,040
能选的也不多 对吧
well, it's not much of a choice, is it?

165
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,420
不 不是的

一场革命即将到来 而我们还在出版

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,490
吹捧大卫·卡西迪的文章

202
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,040
大卫·卡西迪 美国歌星，演员。70年代是其事业的巅峰，
据说那时候他的粉丝团人数比披头士组合和“猫王”的粉丝加起来还要多

203
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,200
嘿 亲爱的
hey ya, honey.

204
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,500
你怎么来了
what are you doing here?

205
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,460
我来绑架你的
oh, i came to kidnap you.

206
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,670
是你在你的杂志里写了你在哪里工作 傻瓜
nah, you put where you work in your magazine, dummy.

207
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,000
-你读了我的杂志  -是的
- you read my magazine? - i did.

208
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,590
怎么 你是以为我文盲吗
what, you think i'm illiterate or something?

209
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,170
-那个  -又不是《普劳斯特》
- well-- - look, it's not proust.

210
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,010
《普鲁斯特》作者是萨缪尔·贝克特（samuel beckett）
1969年因其作品“以新的小说和戏剧的形式从现代人的窘困中获得崇高”
而荣膺诺贝尔文学奖。

211
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,630
是《普鲁斯特》
it's pronounced "proost."

212
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,340
别人喜欢你吗
do people enjoy your company?

213
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,180
不太喜欢 你得赶紧离开 好吗
not really. look, you've got to go, okay?

214
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,560
我的同事都是正派人
my co-workers are g-rated.

215
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,060
她们穿针织套装带珍珠首饰

216
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,640
得了吧 那些穿毛衣的女孩
oh, come on, those sweater girls are all

217
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,270
内心都是怪胎 这一点你得信我的
freaks on the inside, you can trust me on that.

218
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,850
嘿 一点钟到莫特来
hey, come to mort's, 1:00.

219
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,150
咱们聊聊正事 好吗
let's talk business, okay?

220
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,520
你以为我会随随便便
you think i'm just gonna show up

221
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,980
为了什么神秘会面去跟人吃晚餐吗
for some mystery meeting in a diner,

222
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,150
好像我就没其他安排一样
like i have nothing better to--

223
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,690
我们之前在哈瓦苏湖
so, we're up in lake havasu,

224
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,110
给两个妞拍摄
and we're shooting these two chicks

225
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
《亚洲美臀》的封面
for the cover of "asian asses,"

226
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,040
我找到一个特性感的像越南稻田一样的角度
and i got this really sexy kind of vietnam rice paddy angle

227
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,540
结果负责化妆的小子 里奇 把一整袋胶片
and my makeup boy, richie, knocks the bag of film

228
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,710
掉进了水里
right into the water.

229
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,460
所以他去镇上的时候
so we got to shut down

230
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,960
我们只能收工
as he goes into town,

231
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,550
那两个妞就开始叽叽歪歪的
and the chicks start bitching, you know?

232
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,090
-她们是那样  -道格
－ they do that. - "doug, how long

233
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,720
还得等多久啊 外面好冷啊
is this gonna take? it's so cold out here."

234
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
你猜我怎么做的
so guess what i did.

235
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,220
重新思考你存在的意义吗
re- evaluated your entire existence?

236
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,430
我把车里有的唯一一本杂志
i gave them the only thing

237
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,060
给了她们
that i had to read in my car,

238
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,600
就是你的杂志
which was your magazine.

239
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,020
你的插页模特看了《女权觉醒》吗
your centerfolds read "the matriarchy awakens"?

240
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,020
她们也识字的
also not illiterate.

241
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,110
她们喜欢吗
did they like it?

242
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,400
也不是我关心 就是好奇她们是不是
not that it matters. i'm just curious if they--

243
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,280
她们都震惊了
it blew 'em away.

244
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,610
-真的  -真的
- it did? - it did.

245
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,910
已经三个星期了 她们还在讨论
it's been three weeks, and they're still

246
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,990
那些文章
talking about the articles.

247
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,450
其中一个女孩还来找我加薪
and one of em even hit me up

248
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,780
因为你写的一篇有关
about a raise because of something

249
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,290
薪酬差距的文章
that you wrote about the pay gap.

250
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,620
-这个  -虽然不可能
- well-- - i mean, she's not

251
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,870
给她加薪的
gonna get it.

252
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,080
我有很多男性读者
look, i got a lot of readers. men.

253
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,790
他们经常给我写信
and they write to me all the time,

254
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,920
告诉我 道格 世道变了
and they say, "doug, shit's changing."

255
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,920
女孩子也变了
you know, "chicks are changing."

256
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,300
所以我得弄清楚
so i got to figure out, you know,

257
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,760
怎么应对 下一步怎么办
what to do with that, what's next.

258
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,220
然后我开始思考
and then i started thinking

259
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,470
可能我不能再听男人的一家之言了
maybe i got to stop talking to the men.

260
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,430
我得去跟那此女人聊聊
maybe--maybe i should be talking to the women.

261
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,980
你想跟女性谈吗
you want to talk to women?

262
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,310
外面有很多像你这样的人
－ well, there's a lot of you out there,

263
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,610
我想分一杯羹
and i'd like a piece of that pie.

264
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,360
你该不会要发表
oh, you're not suggesting that you publish

265
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
《女权觉醒》吧
"the matriarchy awakens."

266
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,440
不会 天啊 才不会
oh, god no.

267
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,940
至少不能按照这个形式发行
i mean, not in its current form.

268
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,110
别误会 你的想法很好
hey, don't get me wrong, it's good.

269
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,570
但有个问题
it's just you got a challenge.

270
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,450
你的语气给人感觉太慷慨激昂了
and the tone, it comes across as shouty.

271
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,780
读起来有一种
when i'm reading it, i feel like

272
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,160
被班主任训斥的感觉
a fucking teacher is yelling at me.

273
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,620
谁在乎感觉啊
well, who cares how it makes you feel?

274
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,830
重点是让大家思考
it's supposed to make people think.

275
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,250
你需要把药藏起来
you got to hide the medicine.

276
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,290
就像喂狗吃药时
it's like when you give a pill to a dog,

277
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,630
要把药在花生酱沾一沽
you dip it in peanut butter first.

278
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,050
那么问题来了 我们的花生酱是什么
so my question is, what's our peanut butter?

279
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,800
-抱歉 你在等我回答  -是裸男
- i'm sorry, are you waiting-- - it's nude men.

280
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,600
你刚说裸男
did you say nude men?

281
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,470
不是那种肉欲横流的肌肉男
not like a schvantz right in the face,

282
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,890
你知道的 要优雅
you know, classy.

283
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,770
符合你们现代女性的审美
with your modern, you know, lady point of view.

284
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,230
你怕不是有什么大病
are you mentally ill?

285
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,360
别怪我啊 这是你最初的主意
you're the one who came up with the idea.

286
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,020
那就是一句客套话
no--that was a conversational bon mot.

287
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,440
你觉得我现在跟你坐在这里
do you even understand

288
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,820
是想干什么
what it is i am trying to do here?

289
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,400
我当然知道 你想要女权
of course, i do--feminism.

290
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,740
为女孩子们争取平等
making shit fair and equal for the chicks.

291
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,790
你倒是说说看 男人有一打
so tell me this, how is it fair and equal

292
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,370
能看女人奶子的地方 但女人一个看屌的地方找不到
that a guy has twelve places to go to see a pair of titties,

293
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,920
这算什么平等
but a gal has no place to go to see a dong?

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,170
女人不想看到屌
gals do not want to see a dong.

295
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,340
不想吗 你怎么知道
oh, they don't? now how do you know?

296
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,010
-因为我就是女的  -嗯
- because i am one, so. - mm.

297
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,380
好吧 你想花钱证明吗
well, would you like to put money on it?

298
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,680
-你是说赌一赌吗  -不是的 亲
- what, you mean, like a bet? - no, honey.

299
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,600
我是说办杂志
like a magazine.

300
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,730
他会为你提供办公室和一名员工
he wants to give you an office and a staff

301
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,350
并支持你发表前三期吗
and fund your first three issues?

302
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,690
你不是说这要花5万块吗
didn't you tell me that cost, like, 50 grand?

303
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,190
-也许吧  -乔西
- maybe. - joycie!

304
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,530
这可是一大笔钱
that's a lot of money.

305
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,530
对 但是有附加条件的
yeah, but it comes with strings.

306
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,240
你知道的 套路层层叠叠
you know, big ones wrapped around peckers.

307
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,660
也许藏在杂志背后的
maybe it'll just be a single, tiny weenus

308
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,370
只是一个小小的套路
hidden in the back of the magazine.

309
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,290
你干嘛要劝我干这个
why are you trying to talk me into this?

310
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,500
你是我的小妹
you're my baby sister.

311
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,910
我不想看你整天劳累奔波
i hate to see you spin your wheels.

312
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,540
你已经努力很久了
you've been at this for so iong.

313
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,130
我知道这是个好机会
look, i know it's a good opportunity.

314
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,050
-算是一个机会吧  -唯一的机会
- well, an opportunity. - the only opportunity.

315
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,380
但为什么偏偏是这个人呢
－ why does it have to come from this guy?

316
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,840
他错得太离谱
he's just so wrong.

317
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,890
你觉得莱尼具备我对
do you think that lenny had all of the qualities

318
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,720
一个丈夫的要求吗
i was looking for in a husband?

319
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,600
我想要的是一个喜欢到处旅行的人
you know i wanted someone who loved to travel,

320
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,310
而不是看一眼中餐都会拉肚子的人
not someone who gets diarrhea from looking at chinese food.

321
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,900
但他对我很好 他是个好爸爸
but he takes care of me. he's a great dad.

322
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,480
我虽然没得到期望中的一切
no, i didn't get everything i wanted, you know,

323
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,570
但我很知足
but i'm--i'm happy.

324
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,450
好吧 就算我愿意
－ all right, even if i wanted to,

325
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,490
你觉得这东西会有人接受吗
do you think i could pull this off?

326
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,950
这种程度上的裸体
the--the nudity?

327
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,200
怎么不会
why not?

328
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,370
因为我不是那种酷炫女生
'cause i'm not some sexy, cool girl.

329
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,000
-我上的是瓦萨学院  -对
- i went to vassar. - yeah, and that's what

330
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,540
这家伙就是看中这一点 想让七姐妹学院的人才
this guy wants from you, that seven sisters polish...

331
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,090
都来擦亮他的旋钮杂志
all over his magazine of knobs.

332
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,420
雪莉 你说得太恶心了
oh, shelly. don't be disgusting.

333
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,920
怎么了 你是色情作家
what? you're the pornographer.

334
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,800
你得习惯这种谈话
you got to get used to this kind of talk.

335
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,600
我是女人 听我咆哮吧

357
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,540
是啊 哇哦 你这夏天够忙的

yeah, it was almost too much.

359
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,130
其实挺累的
- oh. - i'm tired.

360
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,470
请允许我向你表达感谢
um, can i just say,

361
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,590
非常感谢你给我这个机会
thank you so much for this opportunity?

362
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,470
能向你这样的人学习我真的
i mean, to learn from someone like you is just--

363
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,720
道格没告诉你吗
oh, doug didn't tell you?

364
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,100
我为杂志社工作
i'm working for the magazine.

365
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,310
我是你的新插页协调员
i'm your new centerfold coordinator.

366
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,060
-是吗  -带你参观下
- oh! - okay, tour time.

367
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,770
什么是插页协调员
what is a centerfold coordinator?

368
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,440
不知道啦 是我瞎编的 听起来挺高大上的吧
i don't know, i made it up. doesn't it sound fancy?

369
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,110
我们这里跟普通的
okay, so it's basically just like

370
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,530
老办公室没什么不一样
any other regular old office.

371
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,860
有艺术部 编辑部
we have art department, editorial.

372
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,990
那边是运输部和会计部
that's shipping, accounting.

373
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,030
你不用担心格里
ugh. ignore gerry.

374
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,780
他就是生气而已 道格
he's just mad doug pulled the plug

375
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,950
毙掉了他的杂志 改做你的
on his magazine idea to do yours.

376
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,700
你们的会计都能创办杂志
your accountant created a magazine?

377
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,290
道格这个人你了解
yeah. you know doug.

378
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,290
他觉得任何人都有价值连城的好点子
he thinks a zillion-dollar idea can come from anyone.

379
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,050
这边是照片编辑和
this is all our photo editing and--

380
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,010
他在给那个女人的乳房涂胭脂吗
is he rouging that woman's breasts?

381
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,630
对的
oh, yeah.

382
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,430
强光下看不出乳房的粉色
um, nips don't read pink under hot lights,

383
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,260
我们必须
so we have to--huh.

384
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,600
里奇 小鸡鸡也要化妆的吗
richie, are we gonna have to put makeup on dicks?

385
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,600
但愿吧
mm, one can only hope.

386
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,230
那人是里奇
that's richie.

387
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,600
他是我们的化妆师
- oh. - he's our makeup artist,

388
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,270
也会是你的摄影师
but he's gonna be your photographer,

389
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,980
因为其他人都不想给鸡儿拍照
cause none of the other guys want to shoot wieners.

390
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,770
别担心 我知道怎么拍好看
don't worry, i know my way around a camera.

391
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,610
这么多年我一直在练习给我的伴侣拍照
i've been photographing my lovers throughout the years.

392
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,440
我喜欢你的套装
oh. ooh, i love this ensemble.

393
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,900
幸会
oh. enchante.

394
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,830
早啊
morning.

395
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,460
道格
doug.

396
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,000
看看谁来了
hey, look who made it.

397
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,540
你看起来很累 开了很久的车吧
you look beat. long drive?

398
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,170
来一杯咖啡怎么样
how's a cup of coffee?

399
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,670
来杯茶就好
a cup of tea would be divine.

400
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,760
呃 我不是秘书 我只是黑人
oh, i'm not the secretary. i'm just black.

401
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,090
很抱歉 我是因为看见
i'm so sorry. it was actually the way

402
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,720
你在倒水才以为
that you were pouring the waters that i thought that--

403
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,260
以为我是你网球俱乐部的服务生吗
reminded you of the help at your tennis club?

404
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,930
不 呃
- no. uh--ah, well,

405
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,560
我们确实是网球俱乐部的成员
we are members of a tennis club,

406
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,270
但是那里的服务生大多是墨西哥人
but the waitstaff there is mostly mexican, um--

407
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,440
她在逗你玩呢
she's fucking with you.

408
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,610
蒂娜就是我秘书 都当了十年了
tina's my secretary going on ten years.

409
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,320
-太好笑了  -种族歧视
- oh, that's very funny. - racist.

410
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,620
好了各位 这是我们的时间表 紧紧张张
all right, fuckers, here's our timeline, lean and mean.

411
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,370
只有一周时间做个试发期刊
a week to produce a test issue?

412
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,490
-这也太紧了  -要想做第一个吃螃蟹的人
- that is way too fast. - well, we got to boogie

413
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,160
就必须行动迅速 对吗
if we want to be the first out of the gate, right?

414
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,370
你是说还有别家也想发行
you think there's a second nude

415
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,830
女权主义裸体杂志吗
feminist magazine in the works?

416
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,380
就算现在没有 很快也会有
if there's not now, there soon will be.

417
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,500
插页创意 拍摄 大家有主意了吗
centerfold ideas, shoot. what do we got?

418
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,920
斑比 说吧
bambi, go ahead.

419
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,460
我在想
um, i was thinking,

420
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,590
女人觉得什么东西最性感
what's the number one thing women find sexy?

421
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,340
-智商  -摩托车
- intelligence-- - motorcycles.

422
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,800
想象一下 闪亮的哈雷摩托车
picture this: tricked out harley,

423
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,890
身材魁梧的肌肉男 油门上勾勒出鼓鼓囊囊的轮廓
big, muscley model with a juicy boner draped over the throttle.

424
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,180
标题是什么
- mm. - what's the caption?

425
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,480
-野猪  -油腻骑手
－ "wild hogs." - "greasy riders."

426
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,850
我知道了
- oh. - ooh, i got it.

427
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,860
加把劲儿 带我一骑绝尘
"rode hard and put away wet."

428
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,650
-对 不错  -这个好
- ooh, yes. - that's the one.

429
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,150
-斑比 真是绝了  -真的不错 斑比
- bambi, that's genius. - that's really good, bambi--

430
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,570
但这个
- yo--ah--this is just

431
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,320
和我想的不太一样
not quite what i had in mind.

432
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,620
不过第一次能这样也不错了
it's a great first try though.

433
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,950
-哪里不好  -只不过摩托车跟女权主义
－ what's wrong with it? - it's just, how do motorcycles

434
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,330
之间的联系
relate to feminism?

435
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,080
勃起符合我们的理念吗
are erections consistent with our philosophy?

436
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,420
如果我们的目标是在不同性别之间
if--if our goal is to level the playing field

437
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,340
建立公平的环境 为什么要把生殖器营造成
between the sexes, then should our penises

438
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,880
一种攻击状态呢
be ready to assault?

439
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,670
还是说它们应该平易近人 不显山露水
or--or should they be approachable and unassuming,

440
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,140
轻轻地搭在大腿上 被藏起来
draped gently on a thigh, tucked away, under a throw?

441
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,680
我想你没搞清楚中央插页的重点
i think you're missing the point of a centerfold.

442
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,350
没人关心什么理念
no one cares about philosophy.

443
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,890
唯一重要的问题是 它会让你性奋吗
the only question that matters is, does it turn you on?

444
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,060
这话题是老生常谈了
－ that is a question for the ages,

445
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,610
我们可以就此讨论好几个月
which we could debate for months.

446
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,690
我们也不想讨论几个月 对吧
well, we wouldn't want to do that, now would we?

447
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,570
我们也不想急于求成啊
well, we wouldn't want to rush into things either.

448
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,860
我们应该好好考虑

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,260
要靠我们自己来克服这种动物的欲望
it's up to us to overcome our animal desires--

601
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,600
快叫她闭嘴 那太无聊了
someone please stop her. that is no fun.

602
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,600
-好吧 我可能就是个无趣的人  -你就是
- well, maybe i'm no fun then. - you are.

603
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,470
你对自己有趣的部分感到惧怕
you're just scared of that part of yourself,

604
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,440
因为你觉得这样会显得你软弱
'cause you think it makes you seem weak.

605
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,600
知道吗 人可以是很复杂的动物
you know, you can be more than one thing.

606
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,610
也许对男人来说是这样 女人不能失去重点
uh, maybe for a guy. women cannot lose focus.

607
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,820
好吧 可能是 不管怎样
－ all right, maybe. either way,

608
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,570
这个故事的点子不错
it's a good idea for a story.

609
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,070
这是个好点子 是你刚想出来的吗
mm, that is a good idea. did you just come up with that?

610
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,700
看来我这人也不是简单的动物
i guess i'm more than one thing too.

611
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,910
怎么样
how's that?

612
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,910
-来喝酒  -消防员
- let's drink. - fireman!

613
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,080
消防员 消防员 消防员
all: fireman! fireman! fireman!

614
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,630
-好了 拜  -拜
- okay, bye. - bye!

615
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,260
早上7点了
7:00 a.m. wow.

616
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,970
你有什么需要吗
can i help you with something?

617
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,640
我把你落在我那里的东西
yeah, i was just dropping off some of your stuff

618
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,140
给你送过来
that you left at my place.

619
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,480
想着你可能要准备去上班了呢
thought you'd be getting ready for work by now.

620
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,940
-我要休息一下  -是吗
- took some time off. - did you?

621
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,320
我在跟一个很有声望的出版商
i am developing "the matriarchy awakens"

622
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
在研究《女权觉醒》
with a prominent publisher.

623
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,280
那么多晚上
all those nights,

624
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,740
在你房间里忙来忙去为了啥
working away in your room and for what?

625
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,240
就为了你能当帕萨迪纳的黄刊女王吗
so you could be the porn queen of pasadena?

626
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,410
-你怎么知道  -我怎么知道
- how do you know about-- - how do i know?

627
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,750
大家都会知道的 乔伊斯
everybody's gonna know, joyce.

628
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,120
这种事你瞒不住的
this isn't a secret you can keep.

629
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,500
-太低俗了  -总之 这只是
- this is low. - anyway, it's just--

630
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,170
杂志的一小部分 所以
it's a small part of the magazine, so.

631
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,880
你知道麦格雷戈的故事吗
do you know the story of mcgregor?

632
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,550
-谁  -在苏格兰的一家酒吧里
- who? - a drunk starts talking

633
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,420
一个醉汉开始和一个游客交谈
to a tourist in a scottish pub.

634
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,090
他说 你看到那边的码头了吗
he says, "do you see that dock over there?

635
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,640
是我一砖一瓦造的
"i built it myself, stone by stone.

636
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,060
司是他们会叫我码头工人麦格雷戈吗
"but do they call me mcgregor the dock builder?

637
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,520
不会 你看到那边的桥了吗
"no. you see that bridge over there?

638
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,020
那也是我造的
"i built that too.

639
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,730
可是他们会叫我造桥工人麦格雷戈吗
"but do they call me mcgregor the bridge builder?

640
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,360
不会
"no.

641
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,780
但你操了一只羊的话
but you fuck one sheep--"

642
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,440
你真是个混蛋
you're a real jerk, you know that?

643
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,450
而你是个叛徒
－ and you're a sellout.

644
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,370
祝你的杂志好运
good luck with the magazine.

645
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,370
为梦想妥协
compromising your vision.

646
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,250
听起来不太好
it gets a bad rap,

647
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,290
但真的应该这样吗
but should it?

648
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
但你知道我会说
you know, i say--

649
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,420
格洛丽亚
gloria?

650
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,670
妥协是为那些
compromise is for those

651
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,920
缺乏斗志的人准备的
who lack the will to fight.

652
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,470
你让我们所有人都成了笑柄
you've made a mockery of us all.

653
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,730
-喂  -宝贝
- hello? - babes!

654
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,900
我们打了一天电话了
we've been calling all day.

655
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,110

657
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,160
谁会把拍摄安排在一天之内
who plans a photoshoot in one day?

658
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,370
我们会
we do.

659
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,910
你不觉得这看起来很棒吗
don't you think it looks great?

660
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,460
嘿 里奇 再紧一点怎么样
hey, richie, how'bout a little tighter?

661
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,880
好的
yeah, okay.

662
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,170
这真是拙劣
this is cheesy. and--

663
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,710
抱歉 这太尴尬了
i'm sorry, this is just embarrassing.

664
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,920
这完全没有意义
and it's--this-- it's completely meaningless.

665
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,630
我们应该说点什么
we're supposed to be saying something here.

666
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,140
好了 乔伊斯 来吧 花一分钟享受一下吧

668
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,020
你的梦想而努力工作
to make your dream come true.

669
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,520
你以为这是我的梦想吗
you think this is my dream?

670
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
我的梦想是一锅美味健康的汤汁
my dream is a pot of delicious, healthy soup,

671
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,650
而你所做的只是往里面加了一小块屎
and what you're doing is adding a tiny little piece of shit

672
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,070
然后搅拌 希望没人会注意到
to it and stirring it in, hoping no one's gonna notice.

673
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,490
-哦 是这样吗  -这对我来说
- oh, is that right? - this is not just

674
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,240
不是一件小事 好吗
some piece of business for me, okay?

675
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,410
这是我毕生的事业
this is my life's work. why should i have

676
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,700
我为什么要为了别人而妥协呢
to compromise that for someone else?

677
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,700
因为你他妈要变得成熟点
because grow the fuck up.

678
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,870
这就是原因
that's why.

679
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,240
你觉得你是在帮我
you think you're doing me a favor?

680
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,910
我已经很成功了
i'm a goddamn success story.

681
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,620
我就是美国梦 我很抱歉地告诉你
i'm the american dream, and i'm sorry to tell you this,

682
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,670
乔伊斯 也许你的杂志没有你想像的那么美好
joyce, but maybe your magazine isn't as good as you think it is--yet.

683
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,340
至少现在还没有
as you think it is--yet.

684
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,630
你凭什么这么说
－ who are you to determine that?

685
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,510
我就是资本
i'm the money.

686
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,340
你的资本太贵了
yeah, well, your money costs too much.

687
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,510
那可太糟糕了 因为只有我
well, that's too bad, 'cause i'm the only one

688
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,560
能看到你的能力
who sees what you can do.

689
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,900
各位 我是要把我的老二挂在消防杆上还是

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,850
哟嚯

695
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,720
我偷了孩子们的篮子 把责任推给了复活节的恶魔
i stole the kids baskets and blamed it on the easter devil.

696
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,180
这是我创造的一个新角色
that's a new character i created.

697
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,190
你不是家里唯一的艺术家
you're not the only artist in the family.

it's been weeks.

因为我一直在重新思考我的生活
'cause i've been busy rethinking my life.

i know that you want this for me,

712

但我宁愿永远不出版杂志
but i would rather never publish a magazine

713
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,590
也不愿屈服于某人的坏主意
than capitulate to someone's bad idea.

714
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,590
如果这不是个坏主意呢
－ well, what if it isn't a bad idea?

715
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
一本全是裸体男人的杂志
－ uh, a magazine full of naked men?

716
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,850
这实在是太愚蠢了
it is deeply, inescapably just silly.

717
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,810
你已经在复活节篮子里找到过了吗

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,950
是的
yep.

749
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,870
这让我想到也许
and it made me think

750
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,700
我们应该再给这家杂志一次机会
that maybe we should give this magazine another shot.

751
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,330
我知道男性色情作品正当时
i know that male erotica is in the zeitgeist now,

752
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,580
但我们仍然走在潮流的前面
but we're still ahead of the curve.

753
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,630
我们可以抢在别人
we could be on the newsstands

754
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,750
之前登上报摊
before anyone else.

755
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,170
是的 你知道的 乔伊斯
yeah. you know, joyce,

756
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,760
问题就在这里
here's the thing.

757
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,670
我随便翻开一本我的杂志
i go to any one of my magazines,

758
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,550
大家都想听我说些什么
and, well, people are dying to hear what i have to say,

759
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,390
但你的表现就像我是个小丑
but you act like i'm some sort of a fucking clown

760
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,810
直到某位曼哈顿编辑
until some fancy manhattan editor

761
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,270
把伯特·雷诺兹拿出来
throws old burt reynolds on a bearskin rug,

762
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,190
然后我才能得到你的认可 对吧
and then i get your stamp of approval, huh?

763
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,440
很长时间里杂志是我的一部分
this magazine has been a part of me for a long time,

764
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,360
我没有意识到让它走进这个世界
and i didn't realize how hard it was gonna be

765
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,860
成为一个活生生的
to let it go out into the world

766
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,330
东西会有多么困难
and become this living, breathing thing.

767
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,660
我还以为你是个俗气的推销员 只会耍些花招
i thought you were a tacky salesman with a cheap gimmick.

768
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,910
你确实是这种人
and you kind of are,

769
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,420
但你知道一些我正在琢磨的事
but you do know something that i'm just figuring out.

770
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,840
一本杂志必须让你有某种感觉
that a magazine has--it's got to make you feel something,

771
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,510
看到一个裸体的男人会让女人产生这种感觉
and seeing a naked guy does that to women,

772
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,010
不管她们是好奇 兴奋
whether they are curious or turned on

773
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,430
还是只是想嘲笑他
or just want to laugh at him,

774
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,470
这是一种让女人
it's the ability to look

775
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,430
感到强大的能力
makes a woman feel powerful.

776
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,060
这就是我们杂志的宗旨
that's what our magazine is all about.

777
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,440
或者 你知道 如果
or, you know, it could be if...

778
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,900
你再给我一次机会
you give me one more chance.

779
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,200
我不知道 乔伊斯 我得
i don't know, joyce. i'll have to, uh--

780
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,830
我得好好考虑一下
i'll have to think about it.

781
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,870
好吧 做决定不要太久 道格
all right, well, don't fart up your ass for too long, doug.

782
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,330
我有个插页的好主意
i have a killer idea for a centerfold.

783
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,000
噢 不错
oh, yes.

784
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,670
这可是个好东西
that's hot stuff right there.

785
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,420
好了 女士们 我无聊了 给我更多
okay, ladies, i'm bored. give me more.

786
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,340
-污起来  -看这里 宝贝
- be dirty. - look over here, baby!

787
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,800
嘿 让我们看看你的老二
hey! show us your dick!

788
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,260
女人也可以这么烈的啊
jeez. being a woman's intense.

789
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,100
-是啊  -快给我们
- yeah! - give it to us.

790
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,560
不错 乔伊斯
not bad, joyce.

791
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,440
你知道吗 我得感谢你的插页
you know, i got to hand it to you with this centerfold.

792
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,320
你从帽子里变出了一只兔子
you pulled a rabbit out of a hat.

793
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,150
-谢谢你  -你进步得很快
- thank you. - you've come a long way fast.

794
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,820
生活的收缩或扩张与一个人的勇气成正比
"life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.

795
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,830
生命是 是一个形成的过程
life is--" - "is a process of becoming."

796
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,200
你读过那本书啊
you read the books?

797
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,210
是你让我这么做的 那又怎样 我喜欢他们
you asked me to, so what? i liked'em.

798
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,630
那个阿娜伊斯·宁 她说话真有一套
she's got a way with words, that anais nin.

799
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,170
发音是阿内斯·宁
it's pronounced "anays neen."

800
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,050
你是在逗我吗
are you kidding me right now?

801
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,010
-我不知道我为什么这么做  -好的
- i don't know why i do it. - okay.

802
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,260
-好吧 乔伊斯 有个大问题  -嗯
- all right, joyce, big question. - yeah.

803
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,180
我们要怎么取标题
what are we gonna do about a title?

804
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,100
什么杂志 什么都没有
what, of the magazine? nothing.

805
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,770
《女权觉醒》有什么问题吗
what's wrong with "the matriarchy awakens"?

806
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,060
-这不太行  -恶心
- it's poon poison. - gross.

807
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,900
小妞们听到了 马上就干了
chicks hear it, they dry right up.

808
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,860
我们需要的
what we need
