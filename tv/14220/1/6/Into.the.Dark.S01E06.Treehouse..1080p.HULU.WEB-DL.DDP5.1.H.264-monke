你為什么要...
Why-- you have to--

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,070
你為什么要那么做
why are you doing it like that?

20
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,190
你得把它們疊好
You have to fold, fold, okay?

21
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,280
我們的時間可不多  拜托
We have very little time, left. Please.

22
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,050
我去  各位啊
Holy shit, you guys!

23
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,110
他在煮東西  是水
He's cooking something, it's water,

24
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,780
但恭喜了
but congratulations.

25
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,150
至少還在加熱
There's heat involved.

26
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,650
是烹飪
It's cooking!

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,110
該死
Fuck!

28
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,030
誰贏了玉米粥挑戰
Who won the polenta challenge?

29
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,220
我們待會兒再拍那個
We shoot that later, okay?

30
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,750
但如果要我說了算
But if it is up to me,

31
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,400
他們都贏不了  因為他們...
none of those people, because they're just--

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,480
他們全都太不會烹飪了
they're all so awful at cooking in general.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,230
請別從我的吧臺上掉下來
Please, please don't fall off my bar.

34
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,950
好吧  我就隨便說說
Okay, look, I'm just spitballing here.

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,900
嗯  說吧
Mm-hm, sock it to me.

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,770
我想聽
I want it.

37
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,150
你做我的伴
You be my plus one.

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,060
你要我去參加你媽的婚禮
You want me to crash your mom's wedding?

39
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,540
過來
Come here, come here.

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,850
但那會很奇怪的
But it's gonna be so weird.

41
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,750
坐下
Sit down.

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,840
小老鼠  我沒受邀  好嗎
Mouse, I wasn't invited, okay?

43
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,440
前任一般不會被請去
Ex-spouses don't usually make the cut.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,460
收到
Copy that.

45
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,360
五分鐘  雷克先生
Hey, five minutes, Mr. Rake.

46
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,600
好
Okay.

47
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,870
萊利
Riley, uh...

48
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,180
你媽媽非常愛你
your mom loves you very much.

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,590
我也非常愛你
And I love you very, very much,

50
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,450
雖然這不是競爭
not that it's a competition.

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,500
但聽我說
But listen to me.

52
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,150
這周末之后
Nothing's gonna change

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,510
也不會有什么改變
after this weekend.

54
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,850
好嗎
Okay?

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,350
但你媽媽的新姓氏將變成"蓋可"
Except your mom's new last name will be "Geck."

56
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,380
這太不幸了
That's unfortunate.

57
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,750
我覺得我們該讓他們好好度過這一天
So, I think we should just give them this day

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,960
然后下周末
and then next weekend,

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,930
我們倆
you and me?

60
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,480
我們去應付全世界
We take on the world.

61
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,780
好嗎
Okay?

62
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,360
我們今晚就開始吧
Well, how about we start tonight?

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,160
達奈爾公園剛建成了新迷你高爾夫球場
Darnell Park just cut the ribbon on a new mini golf course.

64
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,590
所以我才叫凱蒂
And why do you think I gave Katie instructions

65
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,890
晚6點前送你過去
to have you there by 6 PM

66
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,180
這樣你就可以站在
so that you can see the sun setting

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,170
新粉刷的1:1風車后面欣賞落日了
behind the freshly painted, sized-to-scale windmill?

68
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,050
好啊  伙計
Hey buddy.

69
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,010
拜托  這周末不行啊
Come on, not this weekend, man.

70
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,600
好吧  等一下的
Okay. Hey, one sec.

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,510
好吧
Oh! Okay.

72
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,550
我想陪你一起去打高爾夫嗎
Look, do I want to be the one that golfs with you?

73
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,600
當然了  但我這周末有太多
Of course. I just have so much work to do

74
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,790
工作要做了  你應該得到
this weekend, and you deserve better

75
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,420
比我更專心的陪伴  好嗎
than my distracted company, okay?

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,290
你陪我的時候往往是心不在焉
Yeah, well, your company's often distracted.

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,650
這個我承認
I handed that one to you, okay?

78
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,380
免費承認
I gave that to you for free.

79
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,140
系個蝴蝶結吧
Had a bow on it.

80
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,310
下周六
Next Saturday,

81
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,900
你  我  達奈爾公園
you, me, Darnell Park.

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,570
但我下周六要踢足球
Okay, but I have a soccer game next Saturday.

83
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,710
那是測試
It was a test.

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,290
恭喜  你通過了
Congratulations, you've passed.

85
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,560
我是想說  下周日
What I meant to say is next Sunday

86
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,760
我們肯定玩瘋
will be off the chain.

87
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,860
別說"玩瘋"
Never say "off the chain."

88
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,440
-反正是句俏皮話  -別傻了
- Whatever's clever. - Don't.

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,550
我都不知道現在流行語是什么了
I don't know what plays anymore.

90
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,410
親愛的  什么流行
Babe, what plays?

91
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,240
告訴我
Tell me.

92
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,650
"酷"又回來了
Okay, well, "rad"'s back.

93
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,350
凱蒂  "酷"又回來了
Oh! Katie, "rad"'s back.

94
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,840
-你知道嗎  -"酷"又回來了
- Did you know that? - "rad"'s back!

95
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,370
是啊  你好酷啊
Yeah. You are so rad.

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,070
你的亂發又很酷
Yeah, well, your floppy hair is rad.

97
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,020
開車要小心
Hey, um, please drive carefully

98
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,310
這可是我最貴重的貨物
because this is my most precious cargo,

99
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,620
如果有什么情況打給我
and, uh, call me if anything goes sideways,

100
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,860
給自己弄點吃的
and would you please feed yourselves?

101
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,890
謝謝  周末愉快
Thanks. Have a great weekend.

102
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,160
-我們可以的  -當然

103
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000

106
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,970

00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,050

巴里  我已經照你的要求做了
Barry, I have done what you've asked,

109
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,720
我周末要離鎮
and I am skipping town for the weekend, okay?

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,060
拜托告訴我你要做什么
Now please tell me what you're doing,

111
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,590

Okay, let's go.

125

這不夠
It's not enough.

126
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,280
-行的  -什么
- No, it's good. - What?

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,190
這是什么啤酒
Wait, what kind of beer is that?

128
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,380
誰拿一下
Hold this, someone.

129
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,810
我理解你  但你不希望她們覺得
I am with you, but also you don't want them

130
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,560
你是拿女人皮做衣服的變態吧
to think you make suits out of lady skins, right?

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
我們走吧
Yes, let's go.

132
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,360
不會吧
No way.

Oh, holy shit.

136

這真不錯呢
this is really great for you.

143
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,550
嗯  我爸幾年前死了
Yeah, my dad kicked the bucket a few years back.

144
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,170
被癌癥吞噬了
The cancer ate him up.

145
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,030
我去  我很遺憾
Shit, I'm sorry to hear that, man.

146
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,810
沒事的
It's okay.

他是個混蛋
He was a mean son of a bitch.

148
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,290
我老爸也是這樣
Well, you know, the same thing happened to my old man,

149
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,940
他也不怎么樣
and he wasn't much of a prize either.

150
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,200
嗯
Yeah.

151
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,140
現在只有我和我母親了
So now it's just me and Mother.

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,830
"母親"啊
"Mother," Huh?

153
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,980
你們考慮過多元化一下嗎
You guys think about diversifying a little bit?

154
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,430
或許加幾個房間
Maybe you could add a few rooms,

155
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,660
在墻上開個洞
poke some tiny holes in the wall,

156
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,180
改名叫貝茨旅館
call it Bait Motel, huh?

157
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,080
朗尼  這里是什么
Lonnie, what's--what's down here?

158
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,820
你放籃子和換洗衣物的地方嗎
Is this where you keep the baskets and the washing, huh?

159
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,010
抱歉  我太傻了
Sorry, that was stupid. It's--

160
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,580
這地方看上去很棒  真的
The place looks great, it really does.

161
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,680
你有垃圾桶
You know, you have bins,

162
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,210
全是魚餌的掛畫
stills just filled with bait.

163
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,620
真是一點沒變
It's exactly the same.

164
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,080
太棒了
It's--it's great.

165
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,390
你妹妹以前常來
Yeah, sister used to come around

166
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,770
有一陣很頻繁
pretty regular for a while.

167
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,490
我妹妹  對啊
Oh, my sister, that's right.

168
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,490
這樣吧  我要一包庫茲煙
Tell you what, I'll take a pack of Kools

169
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,310
不用找了
and--and keep the change.

170
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,120
-我請你了  -不  那怎么行
- It's on me. - No, that's ridiculous.

171
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,650
你的錢在這里沒用
Your money's no good here.

172
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,550
這...
These...

173
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,110
很棒  你太貼心了
These are perfect, and that's-- that's sweet.

174
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,100
謝謝
Thank you, sir.

175
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,460
我會告訴格溫...
I'm gonna tell Gwen that, uh--

176
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,560
等等
Wait, um...

177
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,700
她來了嗎
Is she here?

178
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,130
沒有
No, no, she's not.

179
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,780
她現在幾乎不怎么來這邊了
She--she hardly ever makes it down here.

180
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,420
她都不回來了
She never-- she never makes it back.

181
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,410
但我會告訴她...
But I'm gonna tell her that--

182
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,730
朗尼會說
Lonnie says...

183
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,230
*嗨  格溫*
*Hey Gwennie*

184
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,780
她肯定會喜歡的
Yeah, she's gonna love that.

185
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,150
謝謝了
Thanks, man.

186
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,210
詹
Hey Zan.

187
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,300
潔雅
Hey Jayna.

188
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,450
我們那時真是神奇雙胞胎
Oh, we are so Wonder Twinning right there.

189
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,490
說到青春時期
Speaking of our youth, uh...

190
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,500
艾格尼絲在我們小時候就60多了吧
Agnes was what, 60 years old when we were kids,

191
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
那她現在就...
which would put her at, right now,

192
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,380
至少一百了吧
at least a solid hunge, right?

193
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,210
-超過一百了  -嗯
- A hunge and a deuce? - Yeah.

194
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,190
那她也還能收拾你
And she would still whoop your ass.

195
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,510
他去樓上住
He'll be upstairs,

196
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,750
你父親的舊辦公室
your father's old office.

197
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,130
現在是臥室了
It's a bedroom now.

198
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,170
謝天謝地
Thank God.

199
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,420
我寧可睡外面
I would rather sleep outside

200
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,750
也不想睡我們死去父母冰冷的床
than in our dead parents' stone cold bed.

201
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,930
艾格尼絲  別這樣
Hey, Agnes, please, please, please.

202
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,470
你不用替我把包拿到樓上
You don't have to carry my--my bag up the stairs.

203
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,690
我安排你去北歐水療
Can I just--can I get you a weekend at a Nordic spa

204
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,700
玩一周末吧
or something?

205
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,220
不用了
No.

206
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,030
好吧
Okay.

207
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,400
我唯一的侄女怎么樣了
So how's my one and only niece?

208
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,000
看看吧
Here you go.

209
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,130
天吶
Oh my God.

210
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,960
-開玩笑嗎  -沒有
- Are you kidding me? - I'm not kidding you.

211
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,700
她11歲了  越來越像米歇爾·奧巴馬
She is 11 going on Michelle Obama.

212
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,130
我在圖片分享上粉了她
Oh, I follow her on Instagram,

213
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,610
但她不怎么拍自拍
but she doesn't really do selfies.

214
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,470
我怎么也想不通
I've racked my brains, I can't figure out

215
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,730
她這謙虛的勁頭跟誰學的
where she gets the humility from.

216
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,380
格溫  我不知道
Gwen, I don't know.

217
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,300
-不是跟我學的  -是啊
- Not me. - No, not you.

218
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,590
沒了嗎
So that's it?

219
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,470
真的
Really?

220
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,060
就幾份食譜
Just a couple recipes

221
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,340
和呼吸新鮮空氣
and a few breaths of fresh air?

222
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,510
你就是為了這個而來嗎
That's all that's going on here?

223
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,750
你不知道一直見不到你
I mean, you have no idea how fucked up it's been

224
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,210
沒有你的消息  我都難受
not seeing you and not hearing from you.

225
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,800
我非常清楚這多難受
I'd argue I know exactly how fucked up it's been.

226
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,020
我的號碼沒變過
My number hasn't changed.

227
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,870
知道嗎
You know?

228
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,870
我才是離了婚的那個
I'm the one who went through a divorce, right?

229
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,870
我才是不能參加爸爸葬禮的那個
I'm the one that wasn't welcome at Dad's funeral.

230
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,350
好  我知道了
Yeah, okay, point taken.

231
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,200
好
Okay.

232
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,420
你記得你上次對我
You remember what you said to me

233
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,760
說了什么嗎
the last time?

234
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,620
我當時很艱難  格溫  好嗎
I was going through some shit, Gwen, okay?

235
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,770
然后爸爸剝奪了我的繼承權
And then Dad cuts me out,

236
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,900
但我需要你
but I needed you to fuckin' have--

237
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,080
無論如何都支持你
Have your back no matter what.

238
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,360
是啊
Yeah.

239
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,320
你還好嗎
Yeah, how have you been?

240
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,120
你還好嗎
How have you been, you know?

241
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,180
你還在為正義而戰嗎
You're just still fightin' the good fight?

242
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,240
有跟誰約會嗎
Datin' anybody?

243
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,820
因為我那么有閑嗎
With all the free time I have?

244
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,340
該死
Ah, shit.

245
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,450
猜猜還有誰是單身
Guess who else is single?

246
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,010
-柯林·法瑞爾  -差遠了
- Colin Farrell? - Not even close.

247
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,270
高中的朗尼
Lonnie from high school.

248
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,910
煮兔子的朗尼
Bunny boiler Lonnie.

249
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,460
嗯
Yeah.

250
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,770
他現在在自己開一家
He's running the bait shop

251
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,360
魚餌店
all by himself now.

252
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,880
是啊
I know.

253
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,980
我已經很久沒想過他了
I have not thought about him in a very long time.

254
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,270
天吶  如果你想他了我才擔心呢
Well, I mean, Christ, I would be worried if you had.

255
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,460
但他說
But he does-- he does say...

256
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,310
*嗨  格溫*
*Hey Gwennie*

257
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,980
你還有這個選擇呢
So you've got that going for you.

258
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,070
-好嗎  -你跟他說話了
- Okay? - You spoke to him?

259
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,810
是啊  他還有那個可愛的屁股下巴
I did, and he still has that sweet butt chin.

260
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,680
-好了  夠了  -挺好的
- Okay, stop that. - It's nice, okay.

261
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,140
他只是想做我的朋友  你知道的
He was just trying to be my friend, you know that.

262
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,720
但你是軍樂隊的大號手
But you played the tuba in marching band.

263
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,290
格溫  如果你還跟朗尼玩
Gwen, hanging out with Lonnie

264
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,570
你在高中就算
would have been the final death nail

265
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,560
別想翻身了
in your high school shit coffin.

266
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,820
不客氣
You're welcome.

267
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,980
為什么現在見面
So why now?

268
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,140
我想你了
You know, I miss you.

269
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,330
你是我特別大腦的另一半
You're the other half of my very special brain.

270
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,290
得了
Come on.

271
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,750
我在這兒呢
I'm right here.

272
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,080
跟我說吧
Just talk to me.

273
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,190
是該死的互聯網
It's the fuckin' internet.

274
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,320
你不能...
You can't...

275
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,750
我太容易針對了
I'm an easy target.

276
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,540
格溫  你清楚的
Gwen, you know this, you know this.

277
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,770
我們已經盡可能地審查這些人了
We vet these people the best way we can,

278
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,350
但天吶  肯定要有人遭殃的
but, oh, God, heads are gonna roll.

279
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,590
相信我  敢惹公牛
Mark my words, you mess with the bull...

280
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,980
就被捅
You get the horns.

281
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,420
-知道了  -不  你不懂
- Got it. - No, you don't got it.

282
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,700
所以我們才三年沒說話了
That's why we haven't spoken for three years, Gwen.

283
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,040
該死
Shit.

284
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,010
我得接一下
I gotta take this.

285
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,250
好吧
Oh, okay.

286
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
安迪  什么情況
Andy, what have you got?

287
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,290
你餓了嗎
You hungry?

288
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,170
我們成農民了嗎  艾格尼絲
Are we farmers, Agnes?

289
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,890
你說什么呢
What are you going on about?

290
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,830
那只魔鬼般的黑羊
I'm talking about Black Phillip

291
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,440
就在...
prancing about the...

292
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,920
好吧
Okay, well...

293
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,380
當我沒說
never mind, but...

294
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,420
見到你很高興  孩子
Good to see you, boy.

295
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,220
艾格尼絲
Agnes.

296
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,770
天吶  你真不會說謊
God, you are such a bad liar.

297
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,680
你會恨我的
You're gonna hate me.

298
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,090
"恨"是個強烈  不好擺脫的詞
"Hate" is a strong and sticky word.

299
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,200
我得走了
I have to leave.

300
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,000
嗯  我雙尸案的負責警探
Yeah. The, um, lead detective in my double homicide

301
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,300
剛抓了第二位槍手
just picked up the second shooter.

302
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,820
他們說他愿意開口
They're saying he's willing to talk,

303
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,520
但只肯對地檢官說
but only to the DA,

304
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,390
而那是我
which happens to be me.

305
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,240
你嗎
You?

306
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,650
難以置信
That's incredible.

307
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,520
那太難以置信了
That's fucking-- that's incredible.

308
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,620
什么時候
When, when?

309
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,980
-五個月了  -天吶
- Five months. - Oh my...

310
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,500
我想打給你的
Yeah, I wanted to call you, but--

311
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,450
我妹妹是地檢官了
Shit, my sister is the DA.

312
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,860
你沒開玩笑吧
You're not fucking kidding me?

313
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,760
我們得慶祝一下
We have to celebrate.

314
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,960
-我們慶祝吧  -我們會的
- Let's celebrate. - No, we will.

315
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,050
真的  我保證
We will, I promise, I promise.

316
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,610
我想陪你一周末的
Yeah, I wanted to spend the whole weekend with you.

317
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,000
沒事
Okay, well, there's-- you know,

318
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,340
還有好多周末呢
there's endless weekends.

319
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,540
-是嗎  -如果我說了算的話
- Really? - If I have my way, yes.

320
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,910
好
Okay.

321
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,960
我有新情況會告訴你
Well, I will call with updates.

322
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,900
那好
Please do.

323
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,340
-再見  -嗯
- Okay, bye. - Oh, yeah.

324
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,540
-謝謝  -好
- Thanks. - All right.

325
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,150
艾格尼絲  這墻上之前掛的
Hey, Ags, whatever happened

326
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,110
鮑勃·羅斯先生畫的溫婉的
to the gentle, Bob Ross-esque Alaskan landscape

327
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,570
阿拉斯加景色呢
that used to adorn this wall?

328
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,860
你父親取下來了
Your father moved it

329
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,820
因為他開始畫畫了
when he took up painting.

330
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,080
他最后就干這個
It's pretty much all he did towards the end.

331
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,520
那是他畫的
That one's his.

332
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,910
好啊
Nice.

333
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,920
但這什么玩意啊
But also, what the actual fuck?

334
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,550
他畫的都是
His pieces were all about

335
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,000
生命的脆弱
the fragility of life.

336
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,610
他的葬禮如何
How was his funeral?

337
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,280
冰冷
Cold.

338
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,250
合適
That's fitting.

339
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,160
艾格尼絲
Uh, hey, Ags?

340
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,610
無意冒犯  但你考慮過
I don't mean any offense, but have you ever thought about

341
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,850
找醫生看看
having a doctor take a look

342
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,350
你的眼睛嗎
at those... sweet peepers?

343
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,150
何必
What for?

344
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,550
是我忘不了的事情
It's the things I can't unsee

345
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,320
讓我夜不能寐
that keep me up at night.

346
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,470
艾格尼絲  可以接下電話嗎
Ags, could you get the phone, please?

347
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,840
該死
Shit!

348
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,880
去你的
Oh, fuck you, man.

349
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,730
該死
Shit.

350
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,850
-喂  -彼得
- Hello? - Hi Peter.

351
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,980
我是朗尼
It's Lonnie.

352
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,980
魚餌和魚線的
From Bait and Tackle.

353
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,360
我知道你是誰  朗尼
I know who you are, Lonnie.

354
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,070
但我不知道黃頁上有我們的電話
Um, didn't know this number was listed, though.

355
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,780
之前也是你打來的嗎
Was that-- was that you that was calling earlier?

356
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,900
-哥們  -之前
- Buddy? - Earlier?

357
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,130
沒有  不是我
Mm, no that wasn't me.

358
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,300
你確定你之前沒打給我嗎  朗尼
You--you sure you weren't calling me before, Lonnie?

359
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,110
我只是想確認你還好
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

360
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,410
我挺好
Yeah, no, I'm okay.

361
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,580
謝謝  哥們
Thank you, man, I'm just--

362
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,780
我就小住一下
it's quick in, out, you know?

363
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,150
就拿幾樣東西
Pickin' up a few things, so...

364
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,020
朗尼  你還在嗎
Lonnie, you still there?

365
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,290
你混得真不錯  彼得
You did really good, Peter.

366
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,440
還上了電視什么的
On TV and everything.

367
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,000
我很為你高興
I'm just really happy for you.

368
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,880
好吧
Okay.

369
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,420
好吧
Okay.

370
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,340
該死
Shit.

371
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,300
彼得  我是巴里
Yo, Pete, it's Barry.

372
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,480
我去刺探了一下
Uh... look dude, after doing some more recon,

373
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,850
相信我們能和解
I'm confident we'll be able to settle this, okay?

374
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,240
基本上就是反復洗白
It's basically rinse and repeat.

375
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,910
這次沒必要搞得太難看
There's no reason to drag this one through the mud

376
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,040
除非你想被記錄在案
unless you're willing to go on record,

377
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,840
我當然不建議你這么做
which I certainly wouldn't advise.

378
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,640
你可以給我回電話
Uh, you can holler back

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,870
{\an8}{\pos(192,16)}語音信箱
巴里·斯特恩布什先生

380
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,330
如果你希望我按周末費率計費的話
if you want me to bill you my weekend rate. Uh...

381
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,100
兄弟  放松一下
Look, dude, just try to relax.

382
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,830
別上網去看得自己軍心大亂
Don't go down any rabbit holes on the web, all right?

383
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,800
再見
Ciao.

384
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,320
你好  有什么事嗎
Hi, can I help you?

385
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,280
你好
Hi.

386
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
我是不是在魚餌和魚線見過你
Didn't I see you back at the Bait and Tackle?

387
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,810
是的  我看見你了
Yes, yes, and I saw you.

388
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,510
有那么一瞬間
There--there was a-- there was a moment.

389
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,580
雖然很短暫  但我們四目相對了
It was brief, but we shared it.

390
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,070
你好  我是彼得
Hi, I'm Peter.

391
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,940
卡拉
Kara.

392
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,300
很抱歉打擾你
I'm-- I'm really sorry to bother you.

393
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,450
只是我們遇到了麻煩
We're just--we're in a pickle.

394
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,310
穿過峽谷之后車壞了
Cross the canyon lost power,

395
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,300
備用電機也沒電了
back-up Jenny pooped out.

396
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,580
這就像是單身女子
It's putting a-- a big damper

397
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,810
周末大掃興
on bachelorette weekend.

398
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,480
-這真是...  -所以你需要手電筒
- So it's-- - You need flashlights,

399
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,010
蠟燭和午餐肉
candles, and SPAM.

400
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,780
-你讀懂了我的心  -好吧  進來吧
- You read my mind. - Okay, come on in.

401
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,400
我們看看都有什么
Let's uh, see what we've got.

402
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,220
或者你就站在這兒
Or you stay right there

403
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,250
我把東西拿給你
and I will bring the items to you.

404
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,120
你不知道我是不是泰德·邦迪[連環殺手]  對吧
You don't know if I'm Ted Bundy, do you?

405
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,890
但我必須要警告你
Uh, but I have to warn you,

406
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,900
可能我需要花一分鐘的時間
it might take me, like, a minute

407
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,800
去找我們剛剛說的物品
to find the items we're discussing

408
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,960
因為我自銹根樂隊還火的時候
because I have not been home

409
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,010
就沒來過這里
since Rusted Root was the shit.

410
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,900
你知道嗎  彼得  很冷
You know what, Peter, it's-- it's cold.

411
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,190
我很冷  都怪我自己
I'm cold, and that's on me.

412
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,530
所以  帶路吧
So lead the way.

413
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,290
好的
Okay.

414
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,300
我們可以把門開著
Uh, we can leave this door open.

415
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,080
你確實有他的顴骨
You know, you do have his cheekbones.

416
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,220
誰的顴骨
Whose cheekbones?

417
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,510
泰德·邦迪[連環殺手]
Ted Bundy.

418
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,330
你眼神真好
You are sharp.

419
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,760
只需要一點火花
It only takes a spark

420
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,940
但我們需要更多
but we need more.

421
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,410
這不是壁櫥
That's not a closet.

422
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,550
確實不是
It's not.

423
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,310
很高興知道
Good to know.

424
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,410
很高興知道這不是
It's good to know.

425
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,270
我迷路了
I'm flying blind here.

426
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,910
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

427
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,930
沒事的
That's all right.

428
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,490
這個地方真是...
This place is--

429
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,810
又臟又俗嗎
Awful, tacky?

430
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,690
代表了世家的一切不好
Everything that's wrong with old money?

431
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,820
品味沒有統一標準
There's just no accounting for taste.

432
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,660
你知道嗎
You know what?

433
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,420
我本來想說"漂亮"的
I was gonna say "Beautiful."

434
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,640
這里的景色太美了
I mean, the views are incredible.

435
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,560
好吧
Okay.

436
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,580
所以你是一位音樂家  對吧
So, uh, you are a musician, huh?

437
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,100
我會讀心啊
I read minds.

438
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,220
而且我注意到了你指尖上的老繭
Plus, I noticed the calluses on your fingertips,

439
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,750
這是這位女士彈吉他
which is a sure sign

440
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,000
確切的跡象
the young lady plays the six strings.

441
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,940
沒錯  我在咖啡店和二手書店
Yeah, I make the big bucks

442
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,840
彈琴賺了不少錢
playing coffee shops and used book stores, so...

443
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,340
吃了許多拉面
eat a lot of ramen.

444
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,720
我很欣賞這點
I can appreciate that.

445
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,620
就像你會很感謝這些一樣
Just like you can appreciate these.

446
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,280
-彼得  -怎么了
- Peter? - Yes?

447
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,560
有幾位女士肯定會
I know a handful of ladies

448
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,390
認為你是真正的王子
who are gonna think you're a real prince.

449
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,580
那挺好
Ribbit.

450
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,260
如果事情變得更糟了  你有我的電話
Uh, you have my number if things deteriorate in a meaningful way.

451
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,690
我會的  鄰居
I do, neighbor.

452
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,760
或者
Or, you know,

453
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,110
或許我會牛奶喝光了
maybe I'll just run out of milk.

454
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,100
早上好  你這個老東西
Good morning, you old bastard.

455
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,100
疲倦的人得不到休息  是吧
No rest for the weary, huh?

456
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,270
我正處于盛年  混蛋
I'm in my prime, asshole.

457
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,800
拜托  拜托  不要
Please, please. No, no.

458
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,880
等等
Wait.

459
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,230
彼得
Peter!

460
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,070
彼得
Peter!

461
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,920
彼得
Peter!

462
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,120
-你好  -糟糕  抱歉
- Hey. - Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

463
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,550
我沒看見你戴著耳機
I didn't-- I didn't see the ear buds.

464
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,800
-現在一切都說得通了  -是啊
- Everything makes sense now. - Yeah.

465
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,120
我當然沒聾
No, I'm totally not deaf.

466
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,410
歡迎來到夏爾郡
Uh, welcome to The Shire.

467
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,820
是啊
Oh, yeah.

468
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,960
-樹屋挺酷  -謝謝你
- Cool tree house. - Thank you.

469
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,340
非常感謝你
Thank you very much.

470
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,170
老天  真不敢相信它還沒塌
Man, can't believe that thing is still standing.

471
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,810
以前我和我妹妹一到夏天就搬進去
Me and my sister used to basically move in there every summer.

472
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,740
現在有些混蛋在上面放了些奇怪的東西
Now, some jerk has put a weird thing on the thing,

473
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,060
你們最后怎么樣了
but, hey, how did you guys make out?

474
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,730
你們的進展怎么樣
How did you fare?

475
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,200
不是很好
Oh, not great.

476
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,610
電工要到星期一才能上班
The electrician can't get out till Monday.

477
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,650
-但是...  -糟糕
- But... - Shit.

478
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,640
世事無常  要勇敢面對
Lemonade out of lemons.

479
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,160
昨天晚上還是很愉快的
Last night ended up being really fun.

480
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,700
-挺好的  -是的
- Oh, nice. - Yeah.

481
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,170
-你們倆烏龜好啊  -這不是賽跑
- Hi tortoises. - It's not a God damn race.

482
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,410
當你慢跑  把渾身弄得黏糊糊的時候
While you were jogging getting swamp ass,

483
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,540
我們在分享我們的希望和夢想
we were sharing our hopes and dreams.

484
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,720
沒錯  我們始終保持滿分
That's right, we keep it on the 100.

485
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,630
瑪麗  艾琳娜
Marie, Elena,

486
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,690
我們的好鄰居彼得昨天幫了大忙
like a good neighbor, Peter was there.

487
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,420
那真是太棒了  老兄
Yeah, that was dope, man.

488
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,310
謝謝你
Thank you.

489
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,740
謝謝你們  這是最起碼的
Thank you very much. It's the least I could do.

490
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,150
如果我要盲猜一下
Uh, and if I were to take a shot in the dark,

491
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,710
我猜你馬上要成為家庭主婦了
would presume that you are the soon-to-be kept woman.

492
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,480
你上網查過"家庭主婦"這個詞嗎
Have you ever Googled "Kept woman"?

493
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,290
你熟悉俚語詞典嗎
You familiar with the Urban Dictionary?

494
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,150
糟了
Oh shit.

495
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,590
對不起  我以為這是...
I'm sorry, I thought that was a--

496
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,220
這是一個好詞
that was an okay phrase.

497
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,430
我沒有要冒犯你的意思
Um, I--I did not mean to offend you and--

498
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,120
我跟你開玩笑呢
I'm just playing with you.

499
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,480
-好吧  -看見他的臉了嗎
- Solid. - Saw his face?

500
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,140
都面無血色了
The blood just drained.

501
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,130
真是個不錯的玩笑
That was nice.

502
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,690
我的天  我認識你
Oh my God, I recognize you.

503
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,760
不  我不是艾米·亞當斯[演員]
No, I'm not Amy Adams.

504
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,260
-人們確實...  -不不不
- People do-- - No, no, no.

505
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,240
你是那個主廚
You're that chef.

506
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,130
我在電視上見過你
I seen you on TV.

507
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,320
你有一個節目
You have that show that's, like,

508
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,440
是另一個更有名的廚師的節目的復制版
a facsimile of another show with a more famous chef?

509
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,650
如果你是好意的話  那就謝謝你了
Thank you if you meant that sweetly in any way.

510
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,530
雖然我不這么覺得
And I don't think you did.

511
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,060
但還是要謝謝你認出我來
But still, thank you for recognizing me.

512
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,630
所以你們打算干什么
Um, so what are you guys gonna do?

513
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,610
我們打算留下
We're gonna stay.

514
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,700
就像豪華露營
It's like glamping.

515
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,700
所以你打算勇敢面對了嗎
Oh, okay, so you're gonna make some lemonade?

516
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,020
好吧  我們認輸了
Okay, well, we thrown in the towel.

517
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,500
她的意思是說  如果我們不回去的話
Translation, if we don't get back,

518
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,350
媽媽和茉根會把我們所有的大麻都吸完
Mom and Morgan will smoke all of our weed.

519
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,080
感謝你的蠟燭  男廚神
Thanks for the fire, Chef Boyardee.

520
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,890
回頭見
Check you later.

521
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,280
來吧  別緊張
Come on up and take it easy.

522
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,150
為波多黎各禱告
Pray for Puerto Rico.

523
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,860
-好吧  -一會兒見
- Okay. - See you in a few.

524
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,520
男廚神
Aw, Chef Boyardee.

525
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,490
-還挺有趣的  -所以你跑步嗎
- That's funny. - So you, uh, you run?

526
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,490
被追的時候會跑的
When chased, yes.

527
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,480
而且跑得很快
And quickly.

528
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
我覺得你在謙虛
I think you're being modest.

529
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,530
這個頭巾是不是從你以前最喜歡的襯衫上剪的
That headband didn't cut itself off your favorite old tee.

530
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,070
-這個老東西嗎  -是啊
- This old thing? - Mm-hm.

531
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,080
我有個瘋狂的想法
Hey, I have a-- I have a crazy idea.

532
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,000
你想讓湖結冰  周末我們能在上面打滾嗎
You want to freeze the lake so we can curl all weekend?

533
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,230
我確實想這么做
I really do want to do that.

534
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,800
但首先  我想給你
That's a-- but first, I want to cook for you

535
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,960
和你的朋友做頓飯
and your friends.

536
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,060
在你開口之前
Uh, and before you say anything,

537
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,370
我想讓你知道
uh, I just want to let you know

538
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,510
你會幫我一個大忙的
you'd be doing me a huge solid

539
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,280
因為在我新寫的可能暢銷的食譜書中
'cause I have, I don't know, three or four recipes I need to work out

540
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,090
有三  四個食譜我需要試驗一下
for my new most likely bestselling cookbook.

541
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,240
不是吹牛
Humble brag.

542
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,710
你想讓我們在你的大房子里
And you want us as your guinea pigs

543
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,630
-當你的小白鼠  -是的
- in your big fancy house? - Well.

544
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,550
這場理論的盛宴何時開始
What time would this theoretical multi-course feast kick off?

545
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,450
我確實發現
Um, well, I--I do find that

546
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,020
日落配上開胃小菜堪稱完美
sunset pairs just perfectly with an amuse-bouche.

547
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,120
什么"小菜"都行  真的
Any "Bouche", really.

548
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,080
*艾格尼絲啊艾格尼絲*
*Ags, Ags, Ags, Ags, Ags, Ags*

549
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,220
*艾格尼絲拿著一個土豆*
*Ags got one potato*

550
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,790
我們得把鞋脫了
Gotta take our shoes off.

551
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,980
我不想把鞋脫了
I don't want to take our shoes off.

552
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,040
你知道我什么意思嗎
You know what I mean?

553
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,780
或許這個房子
Maybe it's one of those houses

554
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,450
也是那種你需要脫鞋的房子
where you have to take your shoes off.

555
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,910
-你好啊  -歡迎  女士們
- Hi. - Welcome, ladies.

556
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,830
我想你們會發現這里用充足的電燈
I think you'll find ample electric light.

557
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,780
看看這些白人特權
Oh, look at all this white privilege.

558
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
你們自便
Help yourself.

559
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,550
這是我的媽媽  莉莉絲
This is my mom, Lilith.

560
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,780
又見面了
Hello, you, again.

561
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,540
-畢竟畢竟你點亮了我的生活  -謝謝你
- Well, you lit up my life. - Thank you.

562
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,660
-你幫我戒了煙  -好吧
- You helped me quit smoking. - Oh, well.

563
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,110
你們兩個長得真像
You know the family resemblance is striking, you two.

564
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,950
我知道
Oh, I know.

565
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,660
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}南非大主教

566
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,660
和德斯蒙德·圖圖的一夜改變了我的生活
Well, one night with Desmond Tutu changed my life forever.

567
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,680
真好笑  你真幽默
That's fun, you're fun.

568
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,660
-我們都很幽默  -是的
- We are fun. - You are.

569
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,410
-這幅畫  -我知道
- This painting. - Oh, I know.

570
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,940
我很抱歉  艾格尼絲
I'm sorry-- Agnes?

571
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,380
我讓她拿下來  因為這太恐怖了
You know, I asked her to take that down because it is so morbid.

572
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,880
-我喜歡  -我也是
- Oh, I like it. - Me too.

573
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,610
我也喜歡  當你后退一步的時候
I like it. Once you step back, you know,

574
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,040
就好像你讓這些層次變得平易近人了
and you kind of let the folksy layers--

575
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,230
你叫我嗎
You rang?

576
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,850
艾格尼絲  認識一下我們的客人
Agnes, please meet our guests.

577
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,880
艾格尼絲
Agnes.

578
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,170
她有點像《功夫熊貓》里的阿寶
Ah, she's a bit like Master Po from Kung Fu.

579
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,970
這樣可以嗎  好的
Is that okay? Good.

580
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,520
你好彼得  我是茉根
Hi Peter, I'm Morgan.

581
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,920
你好
Hello.

582
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,780
瑪麗和我在德文郡徒步旅行時相遇
Marie and I met backpacking across Devon.

583
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,250
吃完最后一袋混合干果  我就過來了
Bonded over the last bag of trail mix and here I am.

584
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,060
用高雅的品味來豐富婚禮
Supplementing the nups with a touch of class.

585
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,520
-高雅  -這挺好的
- Touch. - Oh, that's nice.

586
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,630
我猜你一定得到了許多
I bet you've got tons of that

587
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,710
盡管你的身材很脆弱
despite your--your fragile stature.

588
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,540
很溫馨的家
Lovely home.

589
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,370
謝謝你
Thank you.

590
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,330
從建筑上說
Architecturally speaking.

591
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,980
就風格而言  我不能說我真的喜歡
Style wise, I can't say I really care for it.

592
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,580
充其量算混亂
Muddled at best.

593
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,000
首先  這房子蠢極了
First of all, this house is stupid.

594
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,140
其次  你打不打算給我們吃的
Second, are you gonna feed us or what, papi?

595
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,920
因為你一定不想看見我饑餓的樣子
Because you don't want to see me hangry.

596
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,200
都是你們
It's all you guys.

597
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,670
我不行
I can't.

598
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,250
這小東西很好吃
This little things are delicious.

599
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,110
好了
All right.

600
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,130
我要把這發到照片墻上
I've gotta Instagram this.

601
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,490
我會弄一些
And, um, I'm gonna get, like,

602
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,220
椅子套
chair covers.

603
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,430
那叫椅子保溫罩
They're called chair cozies.

604
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,400
不不  婚禮椅子保溫罩肯定很難看
No, no, wedding chair cozies can't look great.

605
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,850
豆袋坐墊都比那強
Fuckin' bean bags would be better.

606
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,790
在你們眼里我像梅格漢·馬克爾[英國王妃]嗎
Do I look like Meghan Markle to y'all?

607
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,580
這就是你為什么應該把婚禮
I mean, that's why you should just have the wedding in,

608
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,740
開在谷倉里的原因
like, a barn of something.

609
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,100
-谷倉  -不  不是真正的谷倉
- A barn? - But not, like, an actual barn.

610
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,250
我的天  忘了我剛才說的
Oh my God, forget I said anything.

611
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,540
彼得  你怎么看待婚禮椅子保溫套的
Peter, how do you feel about wedding chair cozies?

612
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,520
-我嗎  -是的
- Me? Uh, well... - Yeah.

613
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,450
實話跟你們說
...to be honest with you guys,

614
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,950
我根本不知道你們在說些什么
I have no idea what the gentle fuck you're talkin' about.

615
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,090
但我想知道一下
I want to know more though.

616
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,090
我想知道更多  繼續說吧
I want to know more. Keep sharing.

617
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,470
如果你們愿意的話
For those of you willing,

618
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,030
你們接下來要享用的
what you're about to enjoy...

619
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,950
是煎安康魚
is a pan-seared monkfish.

620
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,710
你們將會看到一些英國豌豆
You'll see some English peas.

621
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,760
很新鮮
Those are fresh.

622
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,530
天啊  太好看了
Oh my gosh, this is beautiful.

623
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,310
看起來像是鱈魚
I mean, it looks like cod.

624
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,000
它們有相似點
There's a similarity.

625
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,450
艾琳娜
Uh, Elena,

626
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,800
但是它更高端一些
but, um, it's much higher end.

627
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,730
吃吧  吃吧
Y'all, eat up, eat up also,

628
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,960
因為這在他的飯店里很貴
because this is super expensive at his restaurant.

629
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
我和他分手的主要原因是
The reason I broke up with him mainly

630
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,180
因為他覺得他有權決定
was because he thought he got to decide

631
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,920
我要不要以及什么時候要孩子
when and if I had babies.

632
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,370
還有鹽  對嗎
But also the salt, no?

633
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,680
他連培根都要腌制
Also he salted his bacon.

634
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,050
這太難吃了
Oh, that's always gross.

635
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,890
-不是吧  -確實很惡心
- Fuck no. - Yeah, it was grim.

636
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,760
但我愛的人想要決定
But it wasn't as bad as the man I loved

637
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,240
我的身體什么時候改變
wanting to determine

638
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,390
什么時候有新生命從我身體里破殼而出
when my body transforms and bursts forth with...

639
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,500
-這樣也不壞  -我的天哪
- suckling young. - Goodness gracious,

640
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,980
你說得好像是《阿基拉》的最后一幕  茉根
you make it sound like the last act of Akira, Morgan.

641
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,220
也沒有那么糟
It's not that bad.

642
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,690
抱歉  彼得  你生過孩子嗎
I'm sorry, Peter, have you birthed many children?

643
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,110
很遺憾  我沒生過
Um, I haven't, unfortunately,

644
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,280
但我見過別人生孩子
but I did see it happen.

645
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,260
我親自近距離目睹過
Listen, I saw it happen up close and personal,

646
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,590
我感覺如果我有那個小玩意
and I feel like if I had the gadgetry,

647
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,990
我會要孩子的
I would have delivered.

648
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,090
小玩意  大伙兒
The gadgetry, you guys.

649
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,400
不只是生孩子  對嗎
You know, it's not just the delivery, right?

650
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,590
是接下來發生的一切
It's everything that comes next

651
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,620
和在那之后的一切
and then everything after that.

652
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,700
你說得對  抱歉  我忘了你想辦法
You're right, I'm sorry, I forgot that you managed

653
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,800
略去了分娩的部分
to avoid the pushing part,

654
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,820
你真是太好了  很棒
which is so sweet for you, it's rad.

655
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,410
但我也接受領養  所以...
But I'm also a fan of adoption, so...

656
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,960
我只是說  我不覺得撫養一個小孩
No, I was just saying I don't think raising a child

657
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,500
應該是我們需要優先考慮的一個事
should be another thing we have to prioritize, you know?

658
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,960
這不是負擔或是任務
It's not a burden or a task,

659
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,940
只是很簡單的一件事
it's just simply what is.

660
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,520
就像呼吸一樣  只是你生活的一部分
Becomes as much part of your life as breathing.

661
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,590
但之前被你視作
But then the parts of your life

662
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,400
生活中的一些部分
that you thought were your life,

663
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,440
比如社交或是創業
like socializing or career building,

664
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,220
探索及表達藝術
and, you know, exploring or expressing art,

665
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,930
這些事驅動你  定義你
those things that drove you and defined you,

666
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,810
所有那些沒體驗過的東西
all those boxes get left unchecked.

667
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,100
當然這些事還是很重要的
Of course they still matter.

668
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,990
你們希望你的孩子成人后
And you want your child to grow up

669
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,090
眼中的你不僅僅只是一名母親
and see more than just Mom.

670
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,150
而是一名夢想家  是愛人
You want them to see a dreamer and a lover

671
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,520
是企業家之類的
and an entrepreneur or whatever.

672
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,500
你想讓他們看到
You want them to see...

673
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,300
你
you.

674
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,590
也許還能因此受到啟發
And maybe be inspired.

675
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,650
我的天  母親節是什么時候  五月嗎
Oh my God, when is Mother's Day, May?

676
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,360
該死
Fuck.

677
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,540
我看到你了
I see you.

678
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,460
我愛你
I love you.

679
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,270
暖到我的蛋蛋里去了
Well, that is a cockle warmer.

680
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,040
不笑嗎
No, nothing?

681
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,830
笑點真高
Tough room.

682
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,860
各位  拜托  我開玩笑的
Guys, come on, I'm kidding.

683
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,790
我開玩笑的
I'm kidding.

684
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,040
這是一段美妙的獨白  莉莉絲
That was a beautiful soliloquy, Lilith,

685
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,670
我覺得我們應該為此喝一杯
and I think that we should all drink to it.

686
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,170
我的天  彼得
Oh my God, Peter.

687
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,600
我的老天
Oh my goshness.

688
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,660
我好丟人
I've just embarrassed myself.

689
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,600
-幸虧你抓住了  -沒事的
- Well--well caught. - It's okay.

690
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
我也很好奇
I'm also very curious

691
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,470
這是什么東西
as to what is-- what is that about?

692
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,260
看上去很有趣
That's intriguing.

693
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,730
這是什么
What this is about?

694
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,820
姐妹情誼
Sisterhood.

695
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,960
凱爾特風格  我說的對嗎女士們
Celtic style, am I right, ladies?

696
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:52,710
那是2015年的狂歡節
It was about Mardi Gras 2015.

697
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,640
當時是羊年
Year of the motherfuckin' goat.

698
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,140
我喜歡我們的紋身
Oh, I love our tattoos.

699
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,290
我也是
Yeah, me too.

700
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,850
天啊  有人也出汗嗎  像偷了東西一樣
Oh, whoa, is anybody else sweating like they stole something?

701
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,400
艾琳娜  你怎么這么熱
Elena, how are you hot?

702
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,670
-我不知道  -她總是這樣
- I don't know. - She always is.

703
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,250
*去睡覺吧*
*Go to sleep*

704
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,210
*在被子之下*
*Underneath the cover*

705
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,760
外面有你喜歡的嗎
See anything out there you like?

706
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,030
作為雇主對女傭說
Well, uh, speaking man to matron,

707
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,760
我可以說
I-- I could say

708
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,410
外面沒有我不喜歡的
there's nothing out there I don't like.

709
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,720
你可真是包容啊
How inclusive of you.

710
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,660
謝謝你
Thank you.

711
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,140
但是實話實說
Truthfully, though,

712
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,030
我感覺我覺得被無視了
I am feeling kind of invisible to housewares.

713
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,720
別含含糊糊地說傻話可能會更好
Huh, wiser words without slurring might help.

714
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,170
或許別再瞎說八道了
Maybe stop spilling shit.

715
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,930
你的誠實沒有底線  艾格尼絲
Your honesty is boundary free, Ags.

716
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,000
而我是真的醉了
And I am tipsy.

717
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,900
天啊  吃點東西吧
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

718
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,140
好
Well, sure.

719
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,730
悠著點  我不會再替你收拾你的爛攤子了
Go easy, I'm not gonna clean up any more of your messes.

720
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,360
-給你  -謝謝你
- Here. - Thank you.

721
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,240
謝謝你  又加熱了一遍
Thank you, mm, reheated.

722
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,690
順便說一句  我很喜歡你和你的粥
BTDubs, I'm a big fan of you and your porridge.

723
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,950
-我喜歡  -謝了
- I like that. - Yeah, thanks.

724
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,820
你上次正經和姑娘們一起瀟灑是什么時候了
Yeah, when is the last time you had a solid girls' night out?

725
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,420
我覺得你該出去
I feel like you should get out there,

726
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,040
告訴她們關于埃莉諾·羅斯福的八卦
tell 'em some shit about Eleanor Roosevelt,

727
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,010
你懂我的意思嗎
you know what I'm saying?

728
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,290
也許跟她們說說第一個吸塵器的故事
Maybe tell 'em the story of the first vacuum.

729
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,970
你真是個傻子
You're an idiot.

730
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,680
*在被子之下*
*Underneath the cover*

731
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,900
真是太好聽了
That's-- that's gorgeous.

732
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,260
誰想要奶油或牛奶
Anybody need cream or milk?

733
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,520
就告訴我
Just let me know.

734
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,560
我的天  艾格尼絲
My gosh, Agnes!

735
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,780
你都忙一天了
You've been on your feet all day.

736
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,190
不如你坐會歇歇
Why don't you sit down, take a load off?

737
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,270
也許傳授點知識
Maybe drop some knowledge.

738
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,450
我太老了  可不敢掉[傳授]什么
I'm too old to be dropping anything.

739
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,830
我只是很享受看到姐妹們團聚
I'm just enjoying the festivities watching some sisters commune.

740
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,270
她來了
Oh, there she is.

741
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,860
選舉權
Suffrage.

742
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,300
我的最愛
My day.

743
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,040
都不喜歡嗎  好吧
No? Okay.

744
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,840
其實你們都很幸運
Truth is, you all are lucky.

745
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,770
女人互相依靠并非一直是易事
Wasn't always this easy for women to lean on each other.

746
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,650
曾幾何時
There was a time when it...

747
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,580
你無法選擇要不要表達心聲
wasn't about choosing to be heard,

748
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,940
因為你無法發聲
because you had no voice.

749
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,640
如果不曾擁有  又如何使用
How can you use something you were never given?

750
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,610
女人遭受的痛苦都會在你們心中留下烙印
Something terrible happens to a woman and it just lives in you.

751
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,180
在她心中
In her.

752
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,140
首先侵蝕你的內心  然后蔓延至皮膚
Starts on the inside and then it becomes her skin

753
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,040
直到她死去  都會留有印記
and she wears it till she dies and that's that.

754
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,110
剛剛只是精選  姑娘們
And that was just her tight five, ladies.

755
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:57,220
等著看今年秋天Hulu臺她的特輯上映吧
Wait, just wait until her Hulu special drops this fall.

756
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,540
我為女士們做了巧克力
I made chocolate things for women.

757
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,670
-請別一下子...  -不用了  老兄
- Please don't all just... - I'm good, bro.

758
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,960
-好  -也許等會吧  謝了  彼得
- Yeah. - Maybe later, Peter. Thanks.

759
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,780
看上去像野花
They look like wild flavors.

760
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,340
對  沒錯
Oh, yeah. Yes.

761
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,770
你還好嗎  彼得
You all right over there, Pete?

762
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,250
還行
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,360
我就是  也許酒喝多了
I just-- I maybe had a little too much to drink

764
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,190
吃的太少
and not enough to eat.

765
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,280
這就是  就是廚師的詛咒
This is the-- this is the chef's curse.

766
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,420
恕我失陪一下
Hey, I'll bid you excuse me.

767
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,860
恕我不奉陪
I'll bid you adieu.

768
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,550
你們想待多久都行
Um, stay as long as you like, okay?

769
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,060
如果愿意可以住下來
Stay the night if you like.

770
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,790
午夜時分我可以來點側臥相擁
I will be available for some light spooning during the witching hour,

771
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,340
只要我可以做外側的那個人
as long as I can be the big spoon.

772
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,720
彼得  很感謝你的好意
Peter, your hospitality is greatly appreciated.

773
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,670
謝謝你和艾格尼絲做的美味晚餐
Thank you and Agnes for such a delicious meal.

774
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,320
有種沉重感
I had this gravity.

775
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,470
那里有臺階
There's a step there.

776
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,740
-晚安  -好
- Good night. - Okay.

777

你好啊
Cheerio.

779
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,760
幸好還活著
Well, that's good.

780
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,590
我們喝了多少酒
Hey, how much did we drink?

781
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,430

Okay.

我喜歡你的外套  但是
I do like your outfit, but...

797
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,750
你在這干什么
why are you here?

798
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,890
你是來借宿
Are you a boarder

799
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,550
還是只是探望艾格尼絲
or are you just visiting Agnes?

800

我沒法想象
I just can't imagine

848
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,270
現在你心里的想法
what's running through your head right now.

849
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,450
無需想像  我可以直接告訴你
Oh, you don't need to, I can tell you, it's, uh,

850
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,620
"為什么我他媽的動不了"
"Why can't I move my fuckin' body"

851
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,360
還有"趕緊把這個項圈從我脖子上摘了"
and "Get this collar off me fuckin' now."

852
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,400
別爆粗口
Language!

853
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,140
你以為自己是誰
Who do you think you are?

854
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,540
我以為自己是誰
Who do you think I am?

855
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,010
我很意外你沒認出我  彼得
I'd say I'm surprised you don't recognize me, Peter,

856
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,000
但說實話  上次見你時我還是個孩子
but to be fair, I was a child the last time you were around.

857
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,520
不過大家都說  我和我姐長得一模一樣
Still, everyone says I'm the spitting image of my sister, and, well,

858
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,060
我知道你肯定記得她
I know you remember her.

859
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,600
我完全不知道你在說什么
I have no idea who you're talking about.

860
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,320
惠勒
Wheeler.

861
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,370
卡拉·惠勒
Kara Wheeler.

862
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,860
你是貝卡的妹妹
You're Becca's sister?

863
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,630
曾是
Was.

864
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,780
原來這些瘋狂舉動都是為了她
So that's what all this insanity is about.

865
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,380
她是自殺的
She took the easy way out.

866
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,780
這還是我的錯
It's my fault?

867
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,720
你姐姐的死是一場悲劇
What happened to your sister is tragic.

868
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,450
真的
Truly.

869
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,680
也非常懦弱
It's also fuckin' cowardly.

870
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,650
不是嗎  你的父母怎么辦
Right? What about your parents?

871
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,510
你怎么辦
What about you?

872
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,180
還有海洛因
And then the heroin.

873
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,940
海洛因  卡拉
The fuckin' heroin, Kara.

874
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,620
拜托  我知道你很生氣
Come on, I know you're angry.

875
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,000
你想要些了結  但這個
You want some closure, but this,

876
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,120
這樣你得不到了結
this is not the way to get it.

877
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,880
這樣你將面臨十到二十年的牢獄之災
This... this is how you get 10 to 20.

878
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,570
你知道是我發現了她的尸體嗎
Did you know I was the one that found her?

879
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,980
她用了你的烹飪刀  彼得
She used a knife from your line of cutlery, Peter.

880
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,770
就是在你的狗屁電視節目上出售的那種
The very set you sell on your piece-of-shit TV show.

881
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,390
你以為那是個巧合嗎
Do you think that was a coincidence?

882
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,840
當時我們只是青少年  卡拉
We were teenagers, okay, Kara?

883
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,870
無論你以為發生了什么
And whatever you're thinking,

884
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,220
該死  我保證
fuck, I guarantee you

885
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,930
事情不是那樣  好嗎
that's not what happened, all right?

886
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,040
時間正好
Right on cue.

887
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,100
-好的  -該死
- All right. - Shit.

888
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,600
好
Okay.

889
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,020
那是什么玩意
Uh, what the hell is that?

890
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,960
別擔心  還沒裝上弓呢
Don't worry, it's not loaded.

891
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,640
現在裝上了
Right, then, now that it's loaded,

892
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,250
如果我是你  我就會擔心
I would be worried, if I were you.

893
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,200
什么玩意
What the fuck?

894
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,420
我了個去
Holy shit.

895
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,850
你看上去很緊張  彼得
You seem tense, Peter.

896
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,260
說得好  老大
Way to represent, OG.

897
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,220
這樣也不壞
Suckling young.

898
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,620
天啊
Oh my God.

899
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,190
好吧  你們都是瘋子
Okay, okay, okay, so you are all crazy,

900
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,410
你們都瘋了
you're all just crazy,

901
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,420
你們的大腦有問題
and your brains are sick,

902
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,890
你們會因此受到懲罰的
and you're not gonna get away with this,

903
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:49,150
你們這些憤怒的婊子
you... angry bitches!

904
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,120
彼得
Oh, Peter.

905
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,500
我們不是憤怒的婊子
We're not angry bitches.

906
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,910
我們是憤怒的女巫
We're angry witches.

907
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,660
艾格尼絲
Agnes!

908
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,480
艾格尼絲
Agnes!

909
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:36,980
你對我做了什么
What did you do to me?

910
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,550
癱瘓
The paralysis.

911
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,870
這是個補充咒  但總是很有效
It's a remedial spell but always quite effective.

912
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,580
容我失陪一下  彼得
Now, if you'll excuse me, Peter,

913
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,180
一個女人總有很多事要做
a woman's work is never, ever done.

914
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,760
艾格尼絲
Agnes!

915
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,500
救救我
Help me!

916
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,780
給自己留點自尊  小瘦子
Have some self-respect, Slim.

917
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,570
你們在干什...
What are you...

918
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,800
你們在計劃什么
What are you planning?

919
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,520
你們在干什...
What are you...

920
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,840
你們怎么回事
Hey, what is your deal, even... huh?

921
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,770
那是什么  那是什么
Yeah? What is that-- what is that--

922
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,720
你們剛才交換的那個眼神
what is that nonverbal cue, huh?

923
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,660
你們根本沒在幫我
You guys aren't helping me at all, please.

924
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,260
我們不能讓你這樣出來
We can't let you go out like this.

925
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,120
出門
Out?

926
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,890
別害怕
Don't sweat it.

927
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,170
我們要打理一下你
We're gonna tighten you up.

928
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,120
你們要幫我打理
You're gonna tighten me up,

929
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,940
什么打理  打理什么
what is tighten-- tighten what up?

930
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,100
所有一切
All of it.

931
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,490
拜托
Oh, come on.

932
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:55,750
別動
Shh, stay very still.

933
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,650
不  不不  不能這樣了
No! No, no, this stops now.

934
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,200
*閉嘴閉嘴閉嘴閉嘴*
*Shut, shut, shut, shut*

935
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,390
*閉上你的臭嘴*
*Shut your fucking mouth*

936
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:10,260
*沒人想聽你的廢話*
*No one wants to hear your bullshit*

937
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,880
*閉上你的臭嘴*
*Shut your fucking mouth*

938
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,740
-不  不  -天哪
- No! No. - Oh, boy.

939
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,710
不錯
That's good.

940
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,310
不
No.

941
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,140
天哪
Oh, God.

942
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,730
操
Oh, f...

943
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,060
該死
Oh, shit!

944
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,120
毒蛇給蛇蝎
Snake for snake.

945
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,060
你們都不認識我
You don't even know me.

946
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,570
你們不認識我  你們只知道
You don't know me, all you know is

947
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,010
搜索引擎里讀到的那些
what you read in the search engine.

948
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,960
非常感謝能給我這個獨家采訪
Thank you so much for this exclusive.

949
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,620
說實話  我是你的忠實粉絲
Confession? I'm a big fan,

950
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,420
但這采訪只是工作
But this is just business.

951
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,110
阿諛奉承能給你開很多門
Well, flattery'll get you everywhere.

952
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,690
我的工作就是我的快樂之源
My business is my pleasure.

953
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,100
這是什么
What is this?

954
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,060
-好極了  -沒錯
- Um... great. - Yeah!

955
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,440
那我們開始吧
So let's get started, okay.

956
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,910
你與食物
When did your love affair

957
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,380
何時結下了情緣
with food start?

958
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,820
不如你直接問我你真正想問的問題
Why don't you ask me what you really wanna ask me?

959
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,120
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

960
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,030
好吧  我操了  別這樣
Okay, fuck no, you guys, come on.

961
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,480
你們是一家人  老天
You're family, for Christ's sake.

962
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,540
這簡直錯得太離譜了  怎么
This is wrong on so many levels, what it--

963
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,330
怎么回事
what is happening?

964
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,570
別  我們能不能
Oh-- oh please, can we just,

965
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,390
能不能就專注采訪
stick to the interview?

966
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,280
別裝了  這就是采訪
Come on, this is the interview.

967
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,700
聽著  我...
Look, I--I...

968
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,780
我們能不能專業點
can we just keep it on the level?

969
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,000
-好啊  -我真的不喜歡
- Yeah, yeah. - I'm really not comfortable

970
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,940
-你這樣...  -好吧好吧
- with where this is-- - Okay, okay, hey.

971
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,740
真的嗎
Seriously?

972
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,280
你爭取這個獨家新聞多久了
How long you been chasing this exclusive?

973
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,390
你到底寫給誰看
I mean, who the fuck do you write for?

974
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,840
有誰讀你這玩意  拜托
Who's reading this shit? Come on.

975
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,080
不不  你們這些混蛋
No, no, no, no, you assholes.

976
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,520
我是你成名的機會  我是你成名的機會
I'm your brass ring. I'm your brass ring.

977
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,920
不不  事情不是這樣的
No, that's not how it happened.

978
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,110
事情不是這樣的
That's not how it happened.

979
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:16,110
你們能不能消停會
This-- can you please cut that out?

980
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,070
別演了
Cut--cut that out.

981
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,040
賤人
Ow! Cunt!

982
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,650
你他媽咬了我
You fucking bit me!

983
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,830
原話
Unquote.

984
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,410
她根本不想和你上床  彼得
She don't wanna fuck you, Peter.

985
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,170
雖然她是你的粉絲
Just because she's a fan of your work

986
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,000
但不意味著你能碰她
doesn't mean you get to touch her.

987
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:38,850
這里  或者這里
Here, or here...

988
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,400
不可以
It's not okay.

989
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,840
從來都不可以
It's never been okay.

990
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:45,910
看看奶子
Look at the tits.

991
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,660
看看奶子  兄弟
Check the tits, bro.

992
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,370
不如我告訴你們瘋女人
Hey, how about a giant obvious newsflash

993
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,240
一個顯而易見的道理
for you two certifiable loony bins:

994
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,820
每個故事都有兩面  懂嗎
There's two sides to every story, okay?

995
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,460
她為了這個獨家新聞爭取了好幾周
She chased that exclusive for weeks.

996
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,180
-她在酒吧和我見面  -是你讓她去的
- She met me at a bar. - You told her to meet you there!

997
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,170
她帶了一個錄音筆
She brought a recorder

998
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,320
和一個筆記薄
and a fucking legal pad!

999
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,500
一整晚她都在拼命和我調情
She flirted her ass off with me the whole time.

1000
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,230
之后她竟然還有膽咬我
And then, she had the balls to bite me,

1001
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:09,940
因為她就是個瘋婆子
because she was a crazy bitch!

1002
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,530
你想見識下真正瘋狂的東西嗎
You wanna see something really fucking crazy?

1003
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,330
老天
Oh boy.

1004
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,010
怎么回事
What's happening?

1005
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,090
你惹女巫生氣了  彼得
You pissed off a witch, Peter.

1006
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,860
-而且瑪麗還是伏都教  所以  -該死
- And Marie fucks with voodoo, so... - Oh, shit.

1007
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,390
天哪  天哪  救救我  救救我吧
Oh God. Oh God, help me. Please, please help me.

1008
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,190
還不行  瑪麗
Not yet, Marie.

1009
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,470
時候未到
It's too soon.

1010
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,010
-他自找的  -我知道
- He fucking asked for it. - I have no doubt.

1011
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:11,240
你現在是真的時日無多了
You are officially on borrowed time.

1012
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,310
天哪  快看
Oh boy, look at that.

1013
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,170
看看你干的好事
Look what you did.

1014
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,020
你尿床了
You pissed yourself.

1015
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,920
現在你只能躺在自己的尿里
Now you're gonna have to lay there in your own sauce

1016
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,710
而我還得聞著
and I'm gonna have to smell it.

1017
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,690
但你還是很幸運
Still, you're lucky.

1018
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,220
我本不會阻止她
I wouldn't have stopped her.

1019
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,030
她的烈性子簡直讓我神魂顛倒
All that spitfire just makes me melt.

1020
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,070
不然我為什么向她求婚呢
Why do you think I asked her to marry me?

1021
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,090
她就是我的夢中情人
She checks all my boxes.

1022
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,050
-真惡心  -不好意思
- That is disgusting. - Oh, I'm sorry.

1023
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:46,870
這個對你來說太重口了嗎
Is that a bridge too far?

1024
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,200
該死  所以一切都是謊言嗎
Oh, shit! So it's just all lies, huh?

1025
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,340
天哪  你都沒有孩子
God, you don't even have a kid.

1026
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,720
別傻了
Don't be ridiculous.

1027
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,230
我女兒去年以優異成績畢業
My daughter graduated cum laude last year,

1028
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,870
還是在那次襲擊之后
and that was after the assault.

1029
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,950
幸運的是  那個禽獸還能如魚得水
Luckily, that monster was still able to play in a bowl game.

1030
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,430
絲毫沒有受到任何影響
Hasn't seemed to have affected his draft status one bit.

1031
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,740
感謝上帝她有勇氣站出來
Thank God she had the courage to come forward.

1032
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:13,810
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

1033
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,980
給你敷上
There we go.

1034
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,190
等待第二幕
Stick around for act two.

1035
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,420
到那時我們再閹了你
That's when we castrate you.

1036
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,230
不準偷看
No peeking!

1037
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:01,870
你好啊
¡Hola!

1038
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,360
真是個
That's a nice--

1039
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,190
這顏色真不錯
that's a nice color.

1040
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,570
我很高興你喜歡
Oh, I'm so glad you like it!

1041
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,880
我們覺得這顏色很配你的膚色
We thought it would look good with your skin tone.

1042
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,760
你準備好變身為漂亮彼得了嗎
You ready to become Pretty Peter?

1043
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,230
你準備好戴著手銬腳鏈回菲律賓了嗎
Are you excited to head back to the Philippines in shackles?

1044
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,960
這個混球  你知道我是波多黎各人
Wow. This motherfucker-- you know I'm Puerto Rican!

1045
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,920
你想談談手銬嗎
You wanna talk about shackles?

1046
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,150
當波多黎各還是西班牙殖民地時
You know, when Puerto Rico was still a Spanish colony,

1047
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,130
根本沒有女權這一說
women's rights were unheard of

1048
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,840
而她們對島上的社會貢獻非常受限
and their contributions to the island's society were limited,

1049
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,280
這算說得好聽了
to put it mildly.

1050
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,030
盡管波多黎各女人積極參與
Even though Puerto Rican women were actively participating

1051
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,310
反抗西班牙人
in the revolt against the Spaniards,

1052
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,240
而且沒人比西班牙人更擅長強奸和掠奪
and nobody can rape and pillage like the Spanish,

1053
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,070
不是嗎
am I right?

1054
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,400
放松
Relax.

1055
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,570
我在給你上妝
I'm just texturizing.

1056
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,680
-你能撅嘴嗎  -你能食屌嗎
- Will you pout, please? - Will you eat a dick?

1057
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,620
好粗魯
That's rude.

1058
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,910
信不信由你
Believe it or not,

1059
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,410
我可是個正宗的美國人
I'm as American as apple-motherfucking-pie.

1060
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,110
我的曾祖母為國而戰
My great-grandmother served our great country

1061
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,370
與希特勒和他的盟軍打仗
in the war against Hitler and his allies.

1062
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,580
多么愛國啊
What a patriot!

1063
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,760
我很抱歉這份勇氣沒遺傳給你
I'm sorry that the courage skipped your generation.

1064
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,080
但我感激她的奉獻  真的
But I am grateful for her service, truly.

1065
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,150
是嗎
Are you?

1066
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,010
就像你很感激
The way you're grateful for the service of,

1067
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,490
你的女性員工的付出嗎
I don't know, your female kitchen staff?

1068
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,970
你聽說過同工同酬嗎
You ever hear of equal pay for equal work,

1069
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,760
你這個垃圾
you pasty piece of shit?

1070
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,810
你睡過多少個手下
And how many of them have you slept with, huh?

1071
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,670
包括你開除的那個
Including the one you fired.

1072
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,320
瑪塔·多明戈斯
Marta Dominguez.

1073
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,640
單親媽媽  兩個孩子
Single mother of two,

1074
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,300
不過在你看來  這個世界已經有
and that was enough brown babies for this world,

1075
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,860
夠多的棕色寶寶了
as far as you were concerned.

1076
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,070
這是我們共同的決定
Yeah, we came to that decision together.

1077
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,150
共同
Together?

1078
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,720
那為什么要和解
Then why settle?

1079
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,430
你給了她兩萬吧
That one cost you 20 grand.

1080
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,400
為一個員工花這么多錢可是大手筆
Big money for one of your employees.

1081
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,230
你不該這樣做吧  茉根
Isn't this beneath you, Morgan?

1082
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,470
你們不是發明禮儀的嗎
Didn't you people invent manners?

1083
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:07,850
他是說英國
He means the English.

1084
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,920
這些都不是從那兒傳過來的
None of this shit flies across the Pond.

1085
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,980
這些都是美式最下作的手段
This is strictly American awfulness at its worst.

1086
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,600
首先  彼得
First of all, Peter,

1087
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,670
你這輩子做的下流事
the utter shite that you've been doing

1088
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,750
是在全世界肆虐的
your entire life is part of an international pandemic.

1089
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,950
-說得好  -第二
- Ooh, good word. - Yeah. And second,

1090
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,670
你知道該死的巫術
do you know a thing about fuckin' witchcraft

1091
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,040
和該死的起源嗎
and its fuckin' origins?

1092
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,200
拜托  我...我想和你進行正常的交流
Nice. Come on, I'm... trying to talk to you like a human,

1093
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:32,390
但你卻嘲諷我  還想個惡霸一樣
and you're mocking me and you're wrapping your finger

1094
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,130
把手指扣在扳機上
around a trigger like a bully.

1095
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,340
你害怕的時候真的很無能
You're a real wanker when you're frightened,

1096
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,200
你知道嗎
do you know that?

1097
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,550
我的確很害怕  茉根
Yeah, I'm frightened, Morgan.

1098
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,690
我很害怕  因為我被綁架了  而且
I'm scared, 'cause I've been kidnapped and...

1099
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,890
被陌生人
accused,

1100
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,020
指控  定罪  判刑  我...
and convicted and sentenced by strangers, and I--

1101
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,830
我有一個叫萊利的女兒
I have a daughter named Riley.

1102
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:53,240
但是  彼得
Yeah, but Peter,

1103
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:57,060
摧毀現有的規則就會帶來巨大的改變
great change comes with the destruction of existing rules.

1104
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:58,990
什么
What?

1105
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,720
我妹妹的皮膚和我一樣
My sister's skin is my own,

1106
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,300
我妹妹的心和我一樣
my sister's heart is my own,

1107
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,520
我妹妹的未來和我一樣
and my sister's future is my own.

1108
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,020
該死  她還是個新人
Oh, shit, she's in training, huh?

1109
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,790
這是你第一次  對嗎
This is your first time, isn't it?

1110
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,080
做夢去吧
In your dreams.

1111
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,740
不  我現在可不是做夢
No, not in my dreams, right now.

1112
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:20,930
我了解你
I know you.

1113
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,830
我和你一起長大
I grew up with you.

1114
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,400
茉根
Morgan.

1115
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,010
你就像是我的妹妹
You're just like my sister.

1116
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,480
你渴望被人所接受
You're desperate for acceptance.

1117
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,620
我有個哥哥
I have a brother.

1118
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,810
他會做奶酪洋蔥三明治
He makes cheese-and-onion sandwiches

1119
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,180
他們就做得可好了
and they're the tits.

1120
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,450
你連給他擦鞋都不配
You still couldn't shine his shoes.

1121
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,390
是誰摧毀了你的自尊
Who was it that destroyed your self-esteem so completely

1122
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,550
讓你愿意
that you are willing

1123
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:46,950
加入有史以來都爛的姐妹會
to pledge the worst sorority in history?

1124
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:51,360
是你爸爸嗎
Was it your dad?

1125
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,060
夠了  蠢蛋
That's enough, pendejo.

1126
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,340
每個混蛋都會說
Every asshole says he's an asshole

1127
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,830
因為爸爸是混蛋所以自己才變成混蛋
because his father was an asshole.

1128
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,790
別被他的話迷惑了
No te dejes que te meta en la cabeza.

1129
01:01:58,790 --> 01:01:59,950
這只是他的把戲
It's just dead skin.

1130
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,740
茉根  拜托
Morgan, come on.

1131
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,870
這輩子為你自己
Make one decision for yourself

1132
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,230
-決定一次  -操你媽的
- in your life. - Fuck you!

1133
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,200
你對我的這輩子一點都不了解
You know nothing about my life!

1134
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,090
歡迎加入我們  賤人
Welcome to the fucking game, bitch!

1135
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,890
該死
Oh, shit!

1136
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:54,220
星號  六  九
Star... six... nine.

1137
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,610
-喂  -朗尼  我是彼得
- Hello? - Lonnie-- Lonnie, it's Peter.

1138
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,880
我被女巫們綁架了
I'm a hostage of witches.

1139
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,760
我報過警了  打不通  你能相信...
I tried 911 already, it's busy, can you believe--

1140
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,630
你這樣只會讓你自己更痛苦  彼得
You just made this a lot more painful for yourself, Peter.

1141
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,390
朗尼
Lonnie?

1142
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,730
我是叫這個名字  別忘了
That's my name, don't wear it out.

1143
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,700
天啊  這么晚了  你真是
God, it's so late, you freaked me out there

1144
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,650
嚇了我一跳
for a second.

1145
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,490
沒錯
Right.

1146
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,370
我不住在這里的
I don't live here.

1147
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,620
彼得邀請我們幾位女士來共進晚餐
Peter invited us ladies over for dinner.

1148
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,060
我們沒電了  他可憐我們
Our power went out and he took pity on us.

1149
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,840
彼得給我店里打了個電話
Peter called me at the shop,

1150
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,600
他聽起來很驚慌
he sounded pretty shook up.

1151
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,240
朗尼  彼得沒事
Lonnie, Peter's fine.

1152
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,900
他只是騙你的
He was just yanking your chain.

1153
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,620
就像我們小時候那樣
Like when we were kids?

1154
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:55,670
-但是我們不是小孩子了  -他是個惡霸  朗尼
- Oh, but we're not kids anymore. - He was a bully, Lonnie.

1155
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,420
我很遺憾  如果他曾讓你覺得你...
I'm sorry if he ever made you feel like you were--

1156
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,120
很蠢嗎
Dumb?

1157
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,940
-我不蠢  -我知道
- I'm not dumb. - I know you're not.

1158
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,810
如果你真的指望我相信
Hmm, you probably should turned more lights on,

1159
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,180
你們在里面共進晚餐
if you really wanted me to believe

1160
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:16,130
那你就該多開點燈
that you were inside having supper.

1161
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,180
我要進去看一看
I'll come in and take a look around.

1162
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:25,360
朗尼
Lonnie...

1163
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,880
回家吧  孩子
Go home, boy.

1164
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:30,100
-這與你無關  -母親
- This doesn't concern you. - Mother...

1165
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:33,210
交給我吧  回床上去
I got this handled, go on back to bed.

1166
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,390
我怎么說那玩意的
What did I tell you about that thing, huh?

1167
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,300
我怎么說的
What'd I say?

1168
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:46,520
這里有點不對勁
Something's not right here.

1169
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,830
-你愛你的母親嗎  -當然了
- You love your mother? - 'Course I do.

1170
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:53,970
好吧
All right.

1171
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:56,740
那就收好這個  回家
Then you take this and you go home.

1172
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,070
一切都在掌控之中
Everything's under control.

1173
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,900
你忘記你自己來過這里
You just forget you were ever here.

1174
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,640
你出現的時機正好
Your timing is impeccable.

1175
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,420
彼得知道嗎
Does Peter know?

1176
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,480
彼得和格溫自己當時都只是孩子
Peter and Gwen were just babies themselves.

1177
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,690
你為什么要保守這個秘密
Why'd you have to keep it a secret?

1178
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,290
因為蘋果不會落到離樹很遠的地方
Because the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

1179
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:43,480
天啊
Oh my God.

1180
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:45,760
彼得的父親
Peter's father?

1181
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,010
回去了結你自己挑起的事
Go back in there and finish what you started.

1182
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,170
不要再搞砸了
And no more fuck-ups.

1183
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,990
伙計  搞什么
Hey, man. What the fuck?

1184
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,540
真讓人明白了好多
That was enlightening.

1185
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,100
把鑰匙給我  交給我
Gimme the keys, I'll take care of it.

1186
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:14,750
我要一起來
I'll call shotgun.

1187
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,000
這都沒必要
None of that will be necessary.

1188
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,810
真的嗎
Oh, oh, really?

1189
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,280
跟我的額頭說去
Tell that to my fucking forehead.

1190
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,610
我們應該施更強的咒語
We should've cast a stronger spell.

1191
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,950
我們低估了你
We actually underestimated you.

1192
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:32,930
籠內訓練結束了
Crate training's over.

1193
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,680
布谷  布谷
Oh, cuckoo, cuckoo!

1194
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,790
-這配色真不錯  -我喜歡
- What a beautiful color. - Yeah, I like the way

1195
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:42,220
你穿這件上衣后立起來的奶頭  寶貝
your titties look in that top, baby.

1196
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:47,270
有必要嗎
Look, really?

1197
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:48,760
穿你姐姐的衣服
Your sister's clothes?

1198
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,690
她不是已經入土了嗎
I mean, isn't she rolling in her grave?

1199
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,100
我們要進行女巫捕獵
We're going on a witch hunt.

1200
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,340
你懂嗎  層次不一樣
You get it? Levels.

1201
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,200
應該是我們來捕獵你
It's really more of us hunting you

1202
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,750
而不是你捕獵我們
as opposed to you hunting us.

1203
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,610
對經典的反轉
It's a twist on an old classic.

1204
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,630
走吧  外國佬
Vámonos, gringo. -

1205
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,780
來  跑吧
Come on, jog on!

1206
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,750
快跑  彼得
Go, Pe-ter!

1207
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,080
我能直接射他嗎
Can I just shoot him in the bollocks?

1208
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,130
-快跑  彼得  -拜托
- Go Peter, go! Oh! Come on!

1209
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,690
拜托  拜托
Please, please.

1210
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:15,490
不要這樣  她的在天之靈看著呢
Please stop this. She had a soul.

1211
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,810
-十  -你還是快跑吧  小伙子
- Ten... - You better run, boy.

1212
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:19,150
好吧  抱歉
Hey! Okay, sorry.

1213
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,150

1216
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:35,700

She don't wanna fuck you...

1221

當時我們只是青少年
We were teenagers,

1223
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:12,990
好嗎
okay?

你要告訴我是怎么回事嗎
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

1233
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,480
你穿的是什么東西
What the hell are you wearing?

1234

有一群女巫折磨我

取走了我的血

1239
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,970
她們在我臉上化妝  看看我的臉
They put makeup on my face, look at my face!

1240
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:04,770

Slow down, okay? Just--

1241

我沒法慢點  格溫
I can't slow down, Gwen.

1242

她們把貝卡的自殺怪在我頭上
They're blaming me for Becca's suicide.

1243
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,390
對
Yeah.

01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,370
你知道卡拉嗎  她的妹妹
You know Kara, her sister?

1245
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,940
她就是女殺人魔  她是領頭的
Well, she's the lady Manson, she's the ringleader.

1246
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,580
她們一直在跟蹤我
And they've been following me,

1247
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:19,370
她們知道我的一些非常非常深的秘密
and they know some deep, deep personal secrets.

1248
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,950
她們跟蹤了我  我們得趕緊走
They're stalking me and we need to go,

1249
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:22,470
我們得趕緊去找警察

1250
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,960
操
Oh, fuck!

1251
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,360
她們要把我的屌切了
They were gonna cut my dick off.

1252
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:26,490
操
Fuck!

1253
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,360
我說她們會修理修理你  不是干掉你
I said they could fix you, not "Fix" You.

1254
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:36,720
你剛剛說什么
What in the living shit did you just say to me?

1255
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,010
你聽得很清楚
You heard me.

1256
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,380
這都是你干的
You did this to me?

1257
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,060
-格溫  -我也不想的
- Gwen-- - I didn't want to!

1258
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,760
好嗎  但是你讓我別無選擇
Okay? But you just-- you left me no choice,

1259
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,670
因為歷史又一次重演了
because it's happening all over again, and--

1260
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,220
沒錯  你繼續難受吧
Oh yeah, you better be upset.

1261
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,200
因為你讓我留下了一輩子的陰影
'Cause you have scarred me for life

1262
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,810
你可是我的妹妹
and you are my goddamned sister!

1263
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,860
沒錯  你就是在我們的樹屋里
Yeah, I was your sister when you raped my best friend

1264
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,860
強奸了我最好的朋友
in our fucking treehouse!

1265
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,010
強奸  你說我"強奸"
Rape? Did you just say "Rape" To me?

1266
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,670
上帝啊  格溫  我都不知道
Holy shit, Gwen, I don't even know

1267
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:10,400
這個詞到底是什么意思
what that fuckin' word means anymore.

1268
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,040
沒有人知道  好嗎
Nobody does, okay?

1269
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:13,170
我們當時還是孩子
We were kids.

1270
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:14,930
我才十幾歲  我喝醉了
I was a teenager, I was drunk,

1271
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:18,090
我光著身子  那感覺都是上輩子的事了
I was fuckin' naked, it was a blurry mess

1272
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,470
一片模糊
that happened a lifetime ago!

1273
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,260
不  對你來說是一片模糊  彼得
No, it's a blurry mess to you, Peter.

1274
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,500
對你來說是上輩子的事
It's a lifetime ago to you!

1275
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:28,140
-我說了  我醉了  -不
- Like I said, I was drunk. - No!

1276
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:32,280
不  你永遠有借口  彼得
No, you always have an excuse, Peter,

1277
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,430
你永遠能逃脫
and you always get away with it,

1278
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,190
不僅僅是貝卡
and it is not just with Becca,

1279
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,630
因為還有太多其他受害者
because there have been too many others,

1280
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,850
那個幾年前
what about the journalist that interviewed you

1281
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:42,040
采訪你的記者呢  你對她做了什么
a few years ago, right? Hm, what did you do to her?

1282
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,620
彼得  或者你的那個員工
Huh, Peter? Or the women on your staff,

1283
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,280
或者你的律師
or the new one that your lawyer's

1284
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,980
最近在給你處理的那個  
fixing for you right now, what were the--

1285
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,520
這次的辭退令是怎么寫的
what were the marching orders this time?

1286
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,970
"她來面試真人秀
Is it "Oh, she auditioned for a reality show,

1287
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:54,410
那她肯定是個拜金的婊子"  對嗎
so she just must be a gold-digging whore," Right?

1288
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:56,210
這不是你們公司的信條嗎
Isn't that the company line?

1289
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:03,080
你傷害了貝卡
You hurt Becca

1290
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,640
沒有人相信她的說法
and no one believed her story,

1291
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,420
因為你那么完美  彼得
because you were perfect, Peter,

1292
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,250
你說她是騙子  于是她就變成了騙子
and you called her a liar, so that's what she was.

1293
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:16,430
后來  她就慢慢被吞噬了
And over time, it just ate her alive.

1294
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,220
我維護你
And I defended you

1295
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,150
是因為你是我的哥哥
because you're my brother,

1296
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,870
不是因為我相信你  我不信
not because I believed you, because I didn't.

1297
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,660
這就是我要背負的罪孽
And that's just my cross to bear.

1298
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:39,620
好吧  你...
Yeah, okay, you're...

1299
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,700
你說得對
you're right.

1300
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,520
對不起
I'm sorry.

1301
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,010
你得趕緊開車  趕緊開車走
You have to drive right now. You have to drive right now!

1302
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,000
她們是該死的女巫
They're fuckin' witches!

1303
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,430
-她們沒告訴你她們是女巫嗎  -彼得  別說了
- Did they tell you they're fuckin' witches?   -No, Peter! Stop it!

1304
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:00,790
聽聽你自己說的話
Listen to yourself!

1305
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,470
搞什么  好吧
What the fuck? Okay.

1306
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,170
她們沒和我說過這個
They did not say anything about that.

1307
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:10,950
-我要打給卡拉  -不  不要
- I'm gonna call Kara, and-- - No-- no, don't!

1308
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:12,970
那就是卡拉
That's Kara!

1309
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,760
不  不
No! No!

1310
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,030
彼得  救我  彼得  彼得
Peter, help me! Peter! Peter!

1311
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,580
格溫  格溫
Gwen! Gwen!

1312
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,380
我...我的手
Oh, my... my hands...

1313
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:55,810
不  不
No! No!

1314
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,170
不
Ah! No!

1315
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,130
不
Noo!

1316
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,970
格溫  你在嗎
Gwen, are you here?

1317
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:11,730
早上好  親愛的
Good morning, dear.

1318
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:15,350
-我妹妹呢  -你真好
- Where's my sister? - That's sweet.

1319
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,760
格溫在自己的床上醒來
Gwen woke up in her own bed.

1320
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,670
她不會記得在這里發生的事  所以
She'll have no memory of what happened here, so

1321
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,570
除非你想讓她或者其他人
unless you want her or anyone else, for that matter,

1322
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,660
認為你應該被送進精神病院
to think you belong in an asylum,

1323
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,610
我建議你把我們之間的小小冒險
I suggest you take our little adventure

1324
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,140
帶入墳墓  永不再提
with you to the grave.

1325
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,160
你對我做了什么
What did you do to me?

1326
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:37,860
為了貝卡
For Becca.

1327
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,740
為了貝卡
For Becca.

1328
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,360
為了貝卡
For Becca.

1329
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,010
如果你再干壞事
You fuck up once,

1330
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,320
你再想要傷害任何人
you even think of hurting anyone ever again,

1331
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:58,570
我們就埋了你
we will bury you.

1332
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:00,890
你根本預料不到
You'll never see it coming.

1333
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,690
明白了嗎
Are we clear?

1334
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,150
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

1335
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,020
謝謝
Thank you.

1336
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,080
我們會盯著你  彼得
We'll be watching, Peter.

1337
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,240
真簡單
Well, that was easy.

1338
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,970
有人對他產生同情了嗎
Stockholm syndrome, anyone?

1339
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,220
他說謝謝
He said thank you.

1340
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:33,990
-真老套  -釘子
- That was clutch. - Stakes.

1341
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:36,770
電擊器
Charges?

1342
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:42,350
絕對在白天就得喝一杯了
Definitely day drinking, right?

1343
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:51,290
上帝啊
Jesus!

1344
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,520
不錯的派對小把戲
A hell of a party trick.

1345
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:54,600
的確很不錯
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1346
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:56,910
保持手機開機
Keep your phone on.

1347
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,020
他會給你打電話
He'll call you.

1348
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,260
不是馬上  但是
Not right away, but...

1349
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,580
-他會打來的  -好的
- he'll call. - Right.

1350
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,660
順便  你做得很好
You nailed that, by the way.

1351
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,570
天啊
Oh my God.

1352
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,430
我真的超級擔心他會
I was so nervous that he was gonna

1353
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:08,760
突然跳出車外  或者把我推出車外
jump out of the car or push me out of the car

1354
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,950
讓我們沒法演下去
before we got to the spot.

1355
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,460
然后我...我就失控了
Then I just... I lost my shit.

1356
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,230
我  我真的失控了
I mean, I really lost it.

1357
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,700
你是完美的壓軸
You were the perfect closer.

1358
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,110
我真的很抱歉  卡拉
I'm so sorry, Kara.

1359
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,730
我每天都在想她
I think about her every single day.

1360
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,120
我也是
Yeah, me too.

1361
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,820
天啊  真的很對不起
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1362
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,630
對不起
I'm so sorry.

1363
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,540
這些床單一股尿味
These sheets smell like piss.

1364
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,380
我們的微量添加效果怎么樣  女士們
Final verdict on the micro dosing, ladies?

1365
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:44,400
曼陀羅用對了
Well, the Datura was definitely the right species.

1366
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,290
但很不好調
It's a nasty little fucker.

1367
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,020
我們應該再多加點的
But we coulda used more.

1368
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,070
都怪我  我的煉金術還需要練習
That's on me. Yeah, I'm just growing into my alchemy.

1369
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,900
這個平衡很微妙  因為我們希望他瘸
It's a delicate balance, 'cause you want him to go limp

1370
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,230
出現幻覺  但不能死
and see shit but not die, right?

1371
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,430
我只是想說
Well, I just wanna say

1372
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:59,520
謝謝是肯定的
thank you, obviously.

1373
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:03,550
卡拉剛給我打電話時  我承認我有所懷疑
When Kara first called me, I admit I was skeptical.

1374
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,540
但是聽起來你們真的改變了他
But it sounds like you really reached him.

1375
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,960
或者他只是怕了  以為我們給他的屌下了巫毒術
Or he's just scared and thinks we put voodoo on his dick.

1376
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,250
也許吧
Maybe.

1377
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,490
但也許不是
But maybe not.

1378
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,890
對我來說有區別
Well, it makes a difference to me.

1379
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,050
他是我全部的家人了
He's my whole family.

1380
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,200
你們不像我這么了解他
You don't know him like I do.

1381
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,890
我們齊集一堂都有各自的理由  對嗎
Well, we all have reasons for being here, right?

1382
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,240
我的婚禮還有三小時就開始了  彼得
My wedding is in three hours, Peter.

1383
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,950
你怎么有臉來
How can you possibly justify coming here?

1384
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:40,560
就一分鐘
For one minute.

1385
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,250
我想見見我們的女兒  拜托你
I need to see our daughter, please.

1386
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,250
一分鐘
One minute,

1387
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,030
不能更多了
and that's it.

1388
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,570
-好吧  -天啊  你看上去一團糟
- Okay. - Jesus, you look like shit.

1389
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:59,190
爸爸  你干什么
Dad, what are you doing?

1390
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:02,080
-你沒事吧  -沒事...
- You okay? - Yeah, um...

1391
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,390
我們能去散散步嗎
could we go for a walk?

1392
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,090
-嗯  -謝謝你
- Yeah. - Thank you.

1393
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,060
敬抽沼澤水
To draining the swamp,

1394
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:17,070
一次一個壞男人
one bad hombre at a time.

1395
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:19,900
我覺得我們都可以為此干杯
I think we can all drink to that, cheers.

1396
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,280
這些小泡泡
Little stingy on the bubbly,

1397
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,020
我能連喝三杯
I'm gonna need three of these.

1398
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,200
太棒了
Amazing!

1399
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:39,560
我一直不把你的珍貴當回事
I've taken for granted how precious you are and...

1400
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,250
你每次也都原諒了我
and you let me get away with it every time,

1401
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:44,410
但我不希望你再那樣做了
but I don't want you to do that anymore.

1402
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,620
不能為我  也不為任何男人這樣
Not for me, not for any man.

1403
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:53,150
我再不說謊  寶貝
No more lies, baby, okay?

1404
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,770
我不會再錯過任何事
And I'm never gonna miss a thing.

1405
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:58,080
我會參加你的每一場足球比賽
And I'll be at every soccer game from here on out,

1406
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,010
我會跟其他父母一樣背著
and I'm gonna be carrying one of those big plastic bags

1407
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,240
裝滿橘子片的塑料袋  好嗎
of orange slices like those other parents do, okay?

1408
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:06,960
天啊  爸爸
Oh my God, Dad.

1409
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,280
你要死了嗎
Are you dying?

1410
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,440
不不不  寶貝
No, no, no, baby.

1411
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,310
我覺得我也許該死
I think maybe I should have.

1412
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:17,940
但我還在這里
But I'm still here,

1413
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,610
所以我是全世界
which makes me the luckiest man

1414
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:22,660
最幸運的人
on the planet.

1415
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,590
萊利  我愛你
Riley, I love you...

1416
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,680
好愛你
so much.

1417
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,340
明天見
I will see you tomorrow.

1418
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,990
不是下個周末  就明天  好嗎
Not next weekend, tomorrow, okay?

1419
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:50,470
怎么回事
What is this?

1420
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:52,250
你要死了還是怎么著嗎
What, are you dying or something?

1421
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:57,740
勞拉  我很抱歉  我在各個方面
Laura, I'm so sorry I failed you

1422
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:01,190
都辜負了你
on every conceivable level.

1423
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,610
不僅僅是我
It wasn't just me.

1424
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:34,880
彼得
Hey, Peter.

1425
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,790
你好
Hi-- hi, hello.

1426
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:40,230
我們認識嗎
Uh... do we know each other?

1427
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:41,220
現在認識了
We do now.

1428
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,030
乖乖的哦
Be good.

1429
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:10,470
