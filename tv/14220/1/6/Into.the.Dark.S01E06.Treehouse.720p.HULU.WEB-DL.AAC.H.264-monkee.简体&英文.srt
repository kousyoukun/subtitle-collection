{\an8}莱利

18
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,910
你为什么要...
Why-- you have to--

19
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,110
你为什么要那么做
why are you doing it like that?

20
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,230
你得把它们叠好
You have to fold, fold, okay?

21
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,320
我们的时间可不多  拜托
We have very little time, left. Please.

22
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,090
我去  各位啊
Holy shit, you guys!

23
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,150
他在煮东西  是水
He's cooking something, it's water,

24
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,820
但恭喜了
but congratulations.

25
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,190
至少还在加热
There's heat involved.

26
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,690
是烹饪
It's cooking!

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,150
该死
Fuck!

28
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,070
谁赢了玉米粥挑战
Who won the polenta challenge?

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,260
我们待会儿再拍那个
We shoot that later, okay?

30
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,790
但如果要我说了算
But if it is up to me,

31
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,440
他们都赢不了  因为他们...
none of those people, because they're just--

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,520
他们全都太不会烹饪了
they're all so awful at cooking in general.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,270
请别从我的吧台上掉下来
Please, please don't fall off my bar.

34
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,990
好吧  我就随便说说
Okay, look, I'm just spitballing here.

35
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,940
嗯  说吧
Mm-hm, sock it to me.

36
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,810
我想听
I want it.

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,190
你做我的伴
You be my plus one.

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,100
你要我去参加你妈的婚礼
You want me to crash your mom's wedding?

39
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,580
过来
Come here, come here.

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,890
但那会很奇怪的
But it's gonna be so weird.

41
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,790
坐下
Sit down.

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,880
小老鼠  我没受邀  好吗
Mouse, I wasn't invited, okay?

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,480
前任一般不会被请去
Ex-spouses don't usually make the cut.

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,500
收到
Copy that.

45
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,400
五分钟  雷克先生
Hey, five minutes, Mr. Rake.

46
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,640
好
Okay.

47
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,910
莱利
Riley, uh...

48
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,220
你妈妈非常爱你
your mom loves you very much.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,630
我也非常爱你
And I love you very, very much,

50
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,490
虽然这不是竞争
not that it's a competition.

51
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,540
但听我说
But listen to me.

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,190
这周末之后
Nothing's gonna change

53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,550
也不会有什么改变
after this weekend.

54
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,890
好吗
Okay?

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,390
但你妈妈的新姓氏将变成"盖可"
Except your mom's new last name will be "Geck."

56
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,420
这太不幸了
That's unfortunate.

57
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,790
我觉得我们该让他们好好度过这一天
So, I think we should just give them this day

58
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,000
然后下周末
and then next weekend,

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,970
我们俩
you and me?

60
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,520
我们去应付全世界
We take on the world.

61
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,820
好吗
Okay?

62
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,400
我们今晚就开始吧
Well, how about we start tonight?

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,200
达奈尔公园刚建成了新迷你高尔夫球场
Darnell Park just cut the ribbon on a new mini golf course.

64
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,630
所以我才叫凯蒂
And why do you think I gave Katie instructions

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,930
晚6点前送你过去
to have you there by 6 PM

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,220
这样你就可以站在
so that you can see the sun setting

67
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,210
新粉刷的1:1风车后面欣赏落日了
behind the freshly painted, sized-to-scale windmill?

68
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,090
好啊  伙计
Hey buddy.

69
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,050
拜托  这周末不行啊
Come on, not this weekend, man.

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,640
好吧  等一下的
Okay. Hey, one sec.

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,550
好吧
Oh! Okay.

72
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,590
我想陪你一起去打高尔夫吗
Look, do I want to be the one that golfs with you?

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,640
当然了  但我这周末有太多
Of course. I just have so much work to do

74
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,830
工作要做了  你应该得到
this weekend, and you deserve better

75
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,460
比我更专心的陪伴  好吗
than my distracted company, okay?

76
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,330
你陪我的时候往往是心不在焉
Yeah, well, your company's often distracted.

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,690
这个我承认
I handed that one to you, okay?

78
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,420
免费承认
I gave that to you for free.

79
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,180
系个蝴蝶结吧
Had a bow on it.

80
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,350
下周六
Next Saturday,

81
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,940
你  我  达奈尔公园
you, me, Darnell Park.

82
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,610
但我下周六要踢足球
Okay, but I have a soccer game next Saturday.

83
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,750
那是测试
It was a test.

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,330
恭喜  你通过了
Congratulations, you've passed.

85
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,600
我是想说  下周日
What I meant to say is next Sunday

86
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,800
我们肯定玩疯
will be off the chain.

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,900
别说"玩疯"
Never say "off the chain."

88
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,480
-反正是句俏皮话  -别傻了
- Whatever's clever. - Don't.

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,590
我都不知道现在流行语是什么了
I don't know what plays anymore.

90
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,450
亲爱的  什么流行
Babe, what plays?

91
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,280
告诉我
Tell me.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,690
"酷"又回来了
Okay, well, "rad"'s back.

93
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,390
凯蒂  "酷"又回来了
Oh! Katie, "rad"'s back.

94
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,880
-你知道吗  -"酷"又回来了
- Did you know that? - "rad"'s back!

95
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,410
是啊  你好酷啊
Yeah. You are so rad.

96
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,110
你的乱发又很酷
Yeah, well, your floppy hair is rad.

97
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,060
开车要小心
Hey, um, please drive carefully

98
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,350
这可是我最贵重的货物
because this is my most precious cargo,

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,660
如果有什么情况打给我
and, uh, call me if anything goes sideways,

100
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,900
给自己弄点吃的
and would you please feed yourselves?

101
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,930
谢谢  周末愉快
Thanks. Have a great weekend.

102
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,200
-我们可以的  -当然
- We got this. - Of course. 

103
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,040
嗯
Yup.

104
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,870
你是我的唯一
You are my only.

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,520
我需要你
I need you.

106
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,010
再见
Bye!

107
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,090
好吧
Okay.

108
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,070
巴里  我已经照你的要求做了
Barry, I have done what you've asked,

109
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,760
我周末要离镇
and I am skipping town for the weekend, okay?

110
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,100
拜托告诉我你要做什么
Now please tell me what you're doing,

111
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,630
剧透  最好是有牙的家伙
and, spoiler alert, it better have some fuckin' teeth.

112
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,320
{\an8}树屋

113

{\an8}巴里·斯特恩布什先生

114
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
你有火吗
You got a light?

115
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,490
嗯
Yeah.

116
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,530
给你了
Keep it.

117
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,450
我想戒呢
Trying to quit.

118
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,160
我们都想戒
We're all trying to quit.

119
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,840
我会对它视如己出
I'll treat her like she was my own.

120
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,570
-抱歉  -没事
- Ooh, sorry. - It's okay.

121
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,090
谢谢
Thank you.

122
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,330
好吧
All right.

123
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,840
好了  我们走吧
Ready, let's go.

124
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,510
好了  走吧
Okay, let's go.

125
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,200
这不够
It's not enough.

126
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,320
-行的  -什么
- No, it's good. - What?

127
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,230
这是什么啤酒
Wait, what kind of beer is that?

128
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,420
谁拿一下
Hold this, someone.

129
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,850
我理解你  但你不希望她们觉得
I am with you, but also you don't want them

130
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,600
你是拿女人皮做衣服的变态吧
to think you make suits out of lady skins, right?

131
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,080
我们走吧
Yes, let's go.

132
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,400
不会吧
No way.

133
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,630
彼得·雷克
Peter Rake.

134
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,970
是啊  我是彼得大厨本人
Yeah, yes, I am, I am Chef Peter in the flesh.

135
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,550
我去
Oh, holy shit.

136
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,650
你高中时就在这里工作  是吧
Holy shit, you used to work here in high school, didn't you?

137
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,320
莱尼
Lenny.

138
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,320
朗尼
Lonnie.

139
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,210
这里
This is, um...

140
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,480
现在是我的了
It's all mine now.

141
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,440
厉害  哥们
Booya, man, this is...

142
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,830
这真不错呢
this is really great for you.

143
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,590
嗯  我爸几年前死了
Yeah, my dad kicked the bucket a few years back.

144
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,210
被癌症吞噬了
The cancer ate him up.

145
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,070
我去  我很遗憾
Shit, I'm sorry to hear that, man.

146
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,850
没事的
It's okay.

147
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,620
他是个混蛋
He was a mean son of a bitch.

148
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,330
我老爸也是这样
Well, you know, the same thing happened to my old man,

149
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,980
他也不怎么样
and he wasn't much of a prize either.

150
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,240
嗯
Yeah.

151
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,180
现在只有我和我母亲了
So now it's just me and Mother.

152
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,870
"母亲"啊
"Mother," Huh?

153
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,020
你们考虑过多元化一下吗
You guys think about diversifying a little bit?

154
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,470
或许加几个房间
Maybe you could add a few rooms,

155
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,700
在墙上开个洞
poke some tiny holes in the wall,

156
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,220
改名叫贝茨旅馆
call it Bait Motel, huh?

157
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,120
朗尼  这里是什么
Lonnie, what's--what's down here?

158
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,860
你放篮子和换洗衣物的地方吗
Is this where you keep the baskets and the washing, huh?

159
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,050
抱歉  我太傻了
Sorry, that was stupid. It's--

160
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,620
这地方看上去很棒  真的
The place looks great, it really does.

161
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,720
你有垃圾桶
You know, you have bins,

162
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,250
全是鱼饵的挂画
stills just filled with bait.

163
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,660
真是一点没变
It's exactly the same.

164
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,120
太棒了
It's--it's great.

165
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,430
你妹妹以前常来
Yeah, sister used to come around

166
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,810
有一阵很频繁
pretty regular for a while.

167
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,530
我妹妹  对啊
Oh, my sister, that's right.

168
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,530
这样吧  我要一包库兹烟
Tell you what, I'll take a pack of Kools

169
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,350
不用找了
and--and keep the change.

170
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
-我请你了  -不  那怎么行
- It's on me. - No, that's ridiculous.

171
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,690
你的钱在这里没用
Your money's no good here.

172
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,590
这...
These...

173
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,150
很棒  你太贴心了
These are perfect, and that's-- that's sweet.

174
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,140
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

175
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,500
我会告诉格温...
I'm gonna tell Gwen that, uh--

176
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,600
等等
Wait, um...

177
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,740
她来了吗
Is she here?

178
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,170
没有
No, no, she's not.

179
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,820
她现在几乎不怎么来这边了
She--she hardly ever makes it down here.

180
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,460
她都不回来了
She never-- she never makes it back.

181
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,450
但我会告诉她...
But I'm gonna tell her that--

182
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,770
朗尼会说
Lonnie says...

183
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,270
*嗨  格温*
*Hey Gwennie*

184
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,820
她肯定会喜欢的
Yeah, she's gonna love that.

185
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,190
谢谢了
Thanks, man.

186
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,250
詹
Hey Zan.

187
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,340
洁雅
Hey Jayna.

188
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,490
我们那时真是神奇双胞胎
Oh, we are so Wonder Twinning right there.

189
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,530
说到青春时期
Speaking of our youth, uh...

190
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,540
艾格尼丝在我们小时候就60多了吧
Agnes was what, 60 years old when we were kids,

191
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,540
那她现在就...
which would put her at, right now,

192
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,420
至少一百了吧
at least a solid hunge, right?

193
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,250
-超过一百了  -嗯
- A hunge and a deuce? - Yeah.

194
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,230
那她也还能收拾你
And she would still whoop your ass.

195
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,550
他去楼上住
He'll be upstairs,

196
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,790
你父亲的旧办公室
your father's old office.

197
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,170
现在是卧室了
It's a bedroom now.

198
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,210
谢天谢地
Thank God.

199
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
我宁可睡外面
I would rather sleep outside

200
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,790
也不想睡我们死去父母冰冷的床
than in our dead parents' stone cold bed.

201
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,970
艾格尼丝  别这样
Hey, Agnes, please, please, please.

202
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,510
你不用替我把包拿到楼上
You don't have to carry my--my bag up the stairs.

203
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,730
我安排你去北欧水疗
Can I just--can I get you a weekend at a Nordic spa

204
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,740
玩一周末吧
or something?

205
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,260
不用了
No.

206
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,070
好吧
Okay.

207
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,440
我唯一的侄女怎么样了
So how's my one and only niece?

208
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,040
看看吧
Here you go.

209
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,170
天呐
Oh my God. 

210
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,000
-开玩笑吗  -没有
- Are you kidding me? - I'm not kidding you.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,740
她11岁了  越来越像米歇尔·奥巴马
She is 11 going on Michelle Obama.

212
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,170
我在图片分享上粉了她
Oh, I follow her on Instagram,

213
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,650
但她不怎么拍自拍
but she doesn't really do selfies.

214
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,510
我怎么也想不通
I've racked my brains, I can't figure out

215
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,770
她这谦虚的劲头跟谁学的
where she gets the humility from.

216
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,420
格温  我不知道
Gwen, I don't know.

217
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,340
-不是跟我学的  -是啊
- Not me. - No, not you.

218
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,630
没了吗
So that's it?

219
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,510
真的
Really?

220
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,100
就几份食谱
Just a couple recipes

221
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,380
和呼吸新鲜空气
and a few breaths of fresh air?

222
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,550
你就是为了这个而来吗
That's all that's going on here?

223
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,790
你不知道一直见不到你
I mean, you have no idea how fucked up it's been

224
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,250
没有你的消息  我都难受
not seeing you and not hearing from you.

225
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,840
我非常清楚这多难受
I'd argue I know exactly how fucked up it's been.

226
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,060
我的号码没变过
My number hasn't changed.

227
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,910
知道吗
You know?

228
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,910
我才是离了婚的那个
I'm the one who went through a divorce, right?

229
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,910
我才是不能参加爸爸葬礼的那个
I'm the one that wasn't welcome at Dad's funeral.

230
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,390
好  我知道了
Yeah, okay, point taken.

231
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,240
好
Okay.

232
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,460
你记得你上次对我
You remember what you said to me

233
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,800
说了什么吗
the last time?

234
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,660
我当时很艰难  格温  好吗
I was going through some shit, Gwen, okay?

235
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,810
然后爸爸剥夺了我的继承权
And then Dad cuts me out,

236
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,940
但我需要你
but I needed you to fuckin' have--

237
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,120
无论如何都支持你
Have your back no matter what.

238
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,400
是啊
Yeah.

239
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,360
你还好吗
Yeah, how have you been?

240
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,160
你还好吗
How have you been, you know?

241
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,220
你还在为正义而战吗
You're just still fightin' the good fight?

242
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,280
有跟谁约会吗
Datin' anybody?

243
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,860
因为我那么有闲吗
With all the free time I have?

244
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,380
该死
Ah, shit.

245
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,490
猜猜还有谁是单身
Guess who else is single?

246
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,050
-柯林·法瑞尔  -差远了
- Colin Farrell? - Not even close.

247
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,310
高中的朗尼
Lonnie from high school.

248
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,950
煮兔子的朗尼
Bunny boiler Lonnie.

249
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,500
嗯
Yeah.

250
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,810
他现在在自己开一家
He's running the bait shop

251
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,400
鱼饵店
all by himself now.

252
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,920
是啊
I know.

253
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,020
我已经很久没想过他了
I have not thought about him in a very long time.

254
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,310
天呐  如果你想他了我才担心呢
Well, I mean, Christ, I would be worried if you had.

255
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,500
但他说
But he does-- he does say...

256
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,350
*嗨  格温*
*Hey Gwennie*

257
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,020
你还有这个选择呢
So you've got that going for you.

258
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,110
-好吗  -你跟他说话了
- Okay? - You spoke to him?

259
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,850
是啊  他还有那个可爱的屁股下巴
I did, and he still has that sweet butt chin.

260
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,720
-好了  够了  -挺好的
- Okay, stop that. - It's nice, okay.

261
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,180
他只是想做我的朋友  你知道的
He was just trying to be my friend, you know that.

262
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,760
但你是军乐队的大号手
But you played the tuba in marching band.

263
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,330
格温  如果你还跟朗尼玩
Gwen, hanging out with Lonnie

264
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,610
你在高中就算
would have been the final death nail

265
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,600
别想翻身了
in your high school shit coffin.

266
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,860
不客气
You're welcome.

267
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,020
为什么现在见面
So why now?

268
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,180
我想你了
You know, I miss you. 

269
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,370
你是我特别大脑的另一半
You're the other half of my very special brain.

270
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,330
得了
Come on.

271
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,790
我在这儿呢
I'm right here.

272
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,120
跟我说吧
Just talk to me.

273
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,230
是该死的互联网
It's the fuckin' internet.

274
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,360
你不能...
You can't...

275
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,790
我太容易针对了
I'm an easy target.

276
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,580
格温  你清楚的
Gwen, you know this, you know this.

277
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,810
我们已经尽可能地审查这些人了
We vet these people the best way we can,

278
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,390
但天呐  肯定要有人遭殃的
but, oh, God, heads are gonna roll.

279
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,630
相信我  敢惹公牛
Mark my words, you mess with the bull...

280
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,020
就被捅
You get the horns.

281
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,460
-知道了  -不  你不懂
- Got it. - No, you don't got it.

282
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,740
所以我们才三年没说话了
That's why we haven't spoken for three years, Gwen.

283
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,080
该死
Shit.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,050
我得接一下
I gotta take this.

285
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,290
好吧
Oh, okay.

286
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,360
安迪  什么情况
Andy, what have you got?

287
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,330
你饿了吗
You hungry? 

288
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,210
我们成农民了吗  艾格尼丝
Are we farmers, Agnes?

289
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,930
你说什么呢
What are you going on about?

290
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,870
那只魔鬼般的黑羊
I'm talking about Black Phillip

291
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,480
就在...
prancing about the...

292
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,960
好吧
Okay, well...

293
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,420
当我没说
never mind, but...

294
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,460
见到你很高兴  孩子
Good to see you, boy.

295
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,260
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

296
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,810
天呐  你真不会说谎
God, you are such a bad liar.

297
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,720
你会恨我的
You're gonna hate me.

298
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,130
"恨"是个强烈  不好摆脱的词
"Hate" is a strong and sticky word.

299
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,240
我得走了
I have to leave.

300
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,040
嗯  我双尸案的负责警探
Yeah. The, um, lead detective in my double homicide

301
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,340
刚抓了第二位枪手
just picked up the second shooter.

302
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,860
他们说他愿意开口
They're saying he's willing to talk,

303
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,560
但只肯对地检官说
but only to the DA,

304
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,430
而那是我
which happens to be me.

305
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,280
你吗
You?

306
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,690
难以置信
That's incredible.

307
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,560
那太难以置信了
That's fucking-- that's incredible.

308
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,660
什么时候
When, when?

309
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,020
-五个月了  -天呐
- Five months. - Oh my...

310
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,540
我想打给你的
Yeah, I wanted to call you, but--

311
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,490
我妹妹是地检官了
Shit, my sister is the DA.

312
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,900
你没开玩笑吧
You're not fucking kidding me?

313
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,800
我们得庆祝一下
We have to celebrate.

314
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,000
-我们庆祝吧  -我们会的
- Let's celebrate. - No, we will.

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,090
真的  我保证
We will, I promise, I promise.

316
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,650
我想陪你一周末的
Yeah, I wanted to spend the whole weekend with you.

317
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,040
没事
Okay, well, there's-- you know,

318
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,380
还有好多周末呢
there's endless weekends.

319
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,580
-是吗  -如果我说了算的话
- Really? - If I have my way, yes.

320
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,950
好
Okay.

321
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,000
我有新情况会告诉你
Well, I will call with updates.

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,940
那好
Please do. 

323
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,380
-再见  -嗯
- Okay, bye. - Oh, yeah.

324
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,580
-谢谢  -好
- Thanks. - All right.

325
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,190
艾格尼丝  这墙上之前挂的
Hey, Ags, whatever happened

326
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,150
鲍勃·罗斯先生画的温婉的
to the gentle, Bob Ross-esque Alaskan landscape

327
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,610
阿拉斯加景色呢
that used to adorn this wall?

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,900
你父亲取下来了
Your father moved it

329
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,860
因为他开始画画了
when he took up painting.

330
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,120
他最后就干这个
It's pretty much all he did towards the end.

331
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,560
那是他画的
That one's his.

332
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,950
好啊
Nice.

333
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,960
但这什么玩意啊
But also, what the actual fuck?

334
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,590
他画的都是
His pieces were all about

335
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,040
生命的脆弱
the fragility of life.

336
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,650
他的葬礼如何
How was his funeral?

337
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,320
冰冷
Cold.

338
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,290
合适
That's fitting.

339
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,200
艾格尼丝
Uh, hey, Ags?

340
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,650
无意冒犯  但你考虑过
I don't mean any offense, but have you ever thought about

341
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,890
找医生看看
having a doctor take a look

342
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,390
你的眼睛吗
at those... sweet peepers?

343
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,190
何必
What for?

344
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,590
是我忘不了的事情
It's the things I can't unsee

345
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,360
让我夜不能寐
that keep me up at night.

346
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,510
艾格尼丝  可以接下电话吗
Ags, could you get the phone, please?

347
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,880
该死
Shit!

348
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,920
去你的
Oh, fuck you, man.

349
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,770
该死
Shit.

350
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,890
-喂  -彼得
- Hello? - Hi Peter.

351
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,020
我是朗尼
It's Lonnie.

352
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,020
鱼饵和鱼线的
From Bait and Tackle.

353
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,400
我知道你是谁  朗尼
I know who you are, Lonnie.

354
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,110
但我不知道黄页上有我们的电话
Um, didn't know this number was listed, though.

355
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,820
之前也是你打来的吗
Was that-- was that you that was calling earlier?

356
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,940
-哥们  -之前
- Buddy? - Earlier?

357
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,170
没有  不是我
Mm, no that wasn't me.

358
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,340
你确定你之前没打给我吗  朗尼
You--you sure you weren't calling me before, Lonnie?

359
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,150
我只是想确认你还好
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

360
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,450
我挺好
Yeah, no, I'm okay.

361
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,620
谢谢  哥们
Thank you, man, I'm just--

362
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,820
我就小住一下
it's quick in, out, you know?

363
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,190
就拿几样东西
Pickin' up a few things, so...

364
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,060
朗尼  你还在吗
Lonnie, you still there?

365
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,330
你混得真不错  彼得
You did really good, Peter.

366
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,480
还上了电视什么的
On TV and everything.

367
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,040
我很为你高兴
I'm just really happy for you.

368
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,920
好吧
Okay.

369
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,460
好吧
Okay.

370
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,380
该死
Shit.

371
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,340
彼得  我是巴里
Yo, Pete, it's Barry.

372
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,520
听我说  我调查过后
Uh... look dude, after doing some more recon,

373
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,890
相信我们能解决这个问题
I'm confident we'll be able to settle this, okay?

374
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,280
基本上就是重复取证
It's basically rinse and repeat.

375
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,950
这次没必要搞得太难看
There's no reason to drag this one through the mud

376
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,080
除非你想被记录在案
unless you're willing to go on record,

377
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,880
我当然不建议你这么做
which I certainly wouldn't advise.

378
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
你可以给我回电话
Uh, you can holler back

379
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,880
{\an8}语音信箱
巴里·斯特恩布什先生

380
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,370
如果你想按照我的周末收费标准给钱的话
if you want me to bill you my weekend rate. Uh...

381
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,140
兄弟  放松一下
Look, dude, just try to relax.

382
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,870
别去网上探索未知世界  好吗
Don't go down any rabbit holes on the web, all right?

383
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,840
再见
Ciao.

384
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,360
你好  有什么事吗
Hi, can I help you?

385
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,320
你好
Hi.

386
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,440
我是不是在鱼饵和鱼线见过你
Didn't I see you back at the Bait and Tackle?

387
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,850
是的  我看见你了
Yes, yes, and I saw you.

388
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,550
有那么一瞬间
There--there was a-- there was a moment.

389
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,620
虽然很短暂  但我们四目相对了
It was brief, but we shared it.

390
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,110
你好  我是彼得
Hi, I'm Peter.

391
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:08,980
卡拉
Kara.

392
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,340
很抱歉打扰你
I'm-- I'm really sorry to bother you.

393
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,490
只是我们遇到了麻烦
We're just--we're in a pickle.

394
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,350
穿过峡谷之后车坏了
Cross the canyon lost power,

395
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,340
备用修理员珍妮筋疲力尽
back-up Jenny pooped out.

396
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,620
这就像是给单身女子的周末
It's putting a-- a big damper

397
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,850
装了个巨大的阻尼器
on bachelorette weekend.

398
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,520
-这真是...  -所以你需要手电筒
- So it's-- - You need flashlights,

399
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,050
蜡烛和午餐肉
candles, and SPAM.

400
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,820
-你读懂了我的心  -好吧  进来吧
- You read my mind. - Okay, come on in.

401
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,440
我们看看都有什么
Let's uh, see what we've got.

402
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,260
或者你就站在这儿
Or you stay right there

403
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,290
我把东西拿给你
and I will bring the items to you.

404
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,160
你不知道我是不是泰德·邦迪[连环杀手]  对吧
You don't know if I'm Ted Bundy, do you?

405
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,930
但我必须要警告你
Uh, but I have to warn you,

406
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,940
可能我需要花一分钟的时间
it might take me, like, a minute

407
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,840
去找我们刚刚说的物品
to find the items we're discussing

408
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,000
因为我自从锈根乐队解散之后
because I have not been home

409
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,050
就没来过这里
since Rusted Root was the shit.

410
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,940
你知道吗  彼得  很冷
You know what, Peter, it's-- it's cold.

411
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,230
我很冷  都怪我自己
I'm cold, and that's on me.

412
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,570
所以  带路吧
So lead the way.

413
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,330
好的
Okay.

414
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,340
我们可以把门开着
Uh, we can leave this door open.

415
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,120
你确实有他的颧骨
You know, you do have his cheekbones.

416
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,260
谁的颧骨
Whose cheekbones?

417
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,550
泰德·邦迪[连环杀手]
Ted Bundy.

418
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,370
你眼神真好
You are sharp.

419
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,800
只需要一点火花
It only takes a spark

420
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,980
但我们需要更多
but we need more.

421
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,450
这不是壁橱
That's not a closet.

422
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,590
确实不是
It's not.

423
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,350
很高兴知道
Good to know.

424
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,450
很高兴知道这不是
It's good to know.

425
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,310
我迷路了
I'm flying blind here.

426
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,950
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

427
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,970
没事的
That's all right.

428
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,530
这个地方真是...
This place is--

429
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,850
又脏又俗吗
Awful, tacky?

430
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,730
这点钱全都花错地方了
Everything that's wrong with old money?

431
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,860
品味是买不来的
There's just no accounting for taste.

432
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,700
你知道吗
You know what?

433
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,460
我本来想说"漂亮"的
I was gonna say "Beautiful."

434
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,680
这里的景色太美了
I mean, the views are incredible.

435
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,600
好吧
Okay.

436
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,620
所以你是一位音乐家  对吧
So, uh, you are a musician, huh?

437
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,140
我会读心啊
I read minds.

438
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,260
而且我注意到了你指尖上的老茧
Plus, I noticed the calluses on your fingertips,

439
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,790
这是这位女士弹吉他
which is a sure sign

440
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,040
确切的迹象
the young lady plays the six strings.

441
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,980
没错  我在咖啡店和二手书店
Yeah, I make the big bucks

442
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,880
弹琴赚了不少钱
playing coffee shops and used book stores, so...

443
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,380
吃了许多拉面
eat a lot of ramen.

444
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,760
我很欣赏这点
I can appreciate that.

445
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,660
就像你会很感谢这些一样
Just like you can appreciate these.

446
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,320
-彼得  -怎么了
- Peter? - Yes?

447
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,600
很多女士肯定会
I know a handful of ladies

448
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,430
认为你是真正的王子
who are gonna think you're a real prince.

449
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,620
那挺好
Ribbit.

450
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,300
如果事情变得更糟了  你有我的电话
Uh, you have my number if things deteriorate in a meaningful way.

451
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,730
我会的  邻居
I do, neighbor.

452
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,800
或者
Or, you know,

453
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,150
或许我只是牛奶喝完了
maybe I'll just run out of milk.

454
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,140
早上好  你这个老东西
Good morning, you old bastard.

455
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,140
讨厌的人得不到休息  是吧
No rest for the weary, huh?

456
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,310
我正处于盛年  混蛋
I'm in my prime, asshole.

457
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,840
拜托  拜托  不要
Please, please. No, no.

458
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,920
等等
Wait.

459
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,270
彼得
Peter!

460
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,110
彼得
Peter!

461
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,960
彼得
Peter!

462
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,160
-你好  -糟糕  抱歉
- Hey. - Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

463
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,590
我没看见你戴着耳机
I didn't-- I didn't see the ear buds.

464
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,840
-现在一切都说得通了  -是啊
- Everything makes sense now. - Yeah.

465
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,160
我当然没聋
No, I'm totally not deaf.

466
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,450
欢迎来到夏尔郡
Uh, welcome to The Shire.

467
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,860
是啊
Oh, yeah.

468
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,000
-树屋挺酷  -谢谢你
- Cool tree house. - Thank you.

469

非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

470
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,210
老天  真不敢相信它还没塌
Man, can't believe that thing is still standing.

471
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,850
以前我和我姐姐一到夏天就搬进去
Me and my sister used to basically move in there every summer.

472
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,780
现在有些混蛋在上面放了些奇怪的东西
Now, some jerk has put a weird thing on the thing,

473
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,100
你们最后怎么样了
but, hey, how did you guys make out?

474
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,770
你们的进展怎么样
How did you fare?

475
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,240
不是很好
Oh, not great.

476
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,650
电工要到星期一才能上班
The electrician can't get out till Monday.

477
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,690
-但是...  -糟糕
- But... - Shit.

478
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,680
世事无常  要勇敢面对
Lemonade out of lemons.

479
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,200
昨天晚上还是很愉快的
Last night ended up being really fun.

480
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,740
-挺好的  -是的
- Oh, nice. - Yeah.

481
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,210
-你好  乌龟  -这不是比赛
- Hi tortoises. - It's not a God damn race.

482
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,450
当你慢跑  把浑身弄得黏糊糊的时候
While you were jogging getting swamp ass,

483
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,580
我们在分享我们的希望和梦想
we were sharing our hopes and dreams.

484
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,760
没错  我们始终保持满分
That's right, we keep it on the 100.

485
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,670
玛丽  艾琳娜
Marie, Elena,

486
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,730
我们的好邻居彼得昨天帮了大忙
like a good neighbor, Peter was there.

487
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,460
那真是太棒了  老兄

488
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,350
谢谢你

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,780
谢谢你们  这是最起码的
Thank you very much. It's the least I could do.

490
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,190
如果我要盲猜一下
Uh, and if I were to take a shot in the dark,

491
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,750
我猜你马上要成为家庭主妇了
would presume that you are the soon-to-be kept woman.

492
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,520
你上网查过"家庭主妇"这个词吗
Have you ever Googled "Kept woman"?

493
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,330
你熟悉俚语词典吗
You familiar with the Urban Dictionary?

494
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,190
糟了
Oh shit.

495
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,630
对不起  我以为这是...
I'm sorry, I thought that was a--

496
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,260
这是一个好词
that was an okay phrase.

497
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,470
我没有要冒犯你的意思
Um, I--I did not mean to offend you and--

498
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,160
我跟你开玩笑呢
I'm just playing with you.

499
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,520
-好吧  -看见他的脸了吗
- Solid. - Saw his face?

500
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,180
都面无血色了
The blood just drained.

501
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,170
真是个不错的玩笑
That was nice.

502
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,730
我的天  我认识你
Oh my God, I recognize you.

503
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,800
不  我不是艾米·亚当斯[演员]
No, I'm not Amy Adams.

504
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,300
-人们确实...  -不不不
- People do-- - No, no, no.

505
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,280
你是那个主厨
You're that chef.

506
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,170
我在电视上见过你
I seen you on TV.

507
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,360
你有一个节目
You have that show that's, like,

508
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,480
是另一个更有名的厨师的节目的复制版
a facsimile of another show with a more famous chef?

509
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,690
如果你是好意的话  那就谢谢你了
Thank you if you meant that sweetly in any way.

510
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,570
虽然我不这么觉得
And I don't think you did.

511
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,100
但还是要谢谢你认出我来
But still, thank you for recognizing me.

512
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,670
所以你们打算干什么
Um, so what are you guys gonna do?

513
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,650
我们打算留下
We're gonna stay.

514
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,740
就像豪华露营
It's like glamping.

515
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,740
所以你打算勇敢面对了吗
Oh, okay, so you're gonna make some lemonade?

516
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,060
好吧  我们认输了
Okay, well, we thrown in the towel.

517
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,540
她的意思是说  如果我们不回去的话
Translation, if we don't get back,

518
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,390
妈妈和茉根会把我们所有的大麻都吸完
Mom and Morgan will smoke all of our weed.

519
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,120
感谢你的蜡烛  男厨神

521
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,320
来吧  别紧张
Come on up and take it easy.

522
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,190
为波多黎各祷告
Pray for Puerto Rico.

523
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,900
-好吧  -一会儿见
- Okay. - See you in a few.

524
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,560
男厨神

追人的时候会跑的
When chased, yes.

527
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,520
而且跑得很快
And quickly.

528
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,040
我觉得你在谦虚
I think you're being modest.

529
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,570
这个头巾是不是从你以前最喜欢的衬衫上剪的
That headband didn't cut itself off your favorite old tee.

530
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,110
-这个老东西吗  -是啊
- This old thing? - Mm-hm.

531
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,120
我有个疯狂的想法
Hey, I have a-- I have a crazy idea.

532
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,040
你想让湖结冰  周末我们能在上面打滚吗
You want to freeze the lake so we can curl all weekend?

533
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,270
我确实想这么做
I really do want to do that.

534
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,840
但首先  我想给你
That's a-- but first, I want to cook for you

535
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,000
和你的朋友做顿饭
and your friends.

536
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,100
在你开口之前
Uh, and before you say anything,

537
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,410
我想让你知道
uh, I just want to let you know

538
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,550
你会帮我一个大忙的
you'd be doing me a huge solid

539
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,320
因为在我最畅销的食谱书中
'cause I have, I don't know, three or four recipes I need to work out

540
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,130
有三  四个食谱我需要试验一下
for my new most likely bestselling cookbook.

541
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,280
不是吹牛
Humble brag.

542
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,750
你想让我们在你的大房子里
And you want us as your guinea pigs

543
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,670
-当你的小白鼠  -是的
- in your big fancy house? - Well.

544
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,590
这场理论的盛宴何时开始
What time would this theoretical multi-course feast kick off?

545
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,490
我确实发现
Um, well, I--I do find that

546
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,060
日落配上开胃小菜堪称完美
sunset pairs just perfectly with an amuse-bouche.

547
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,160
什么"小菜"都行  真的
Any "Bouche", really.

548
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,120
*艾格尼丝啊艾格尼丝*
*Ags, Ags, Ags, Ags, Ags, Ags*

549
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,260
*艾格尼丝拿着一个土豆*
*Ags got one potato*

550
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:50,830
我们得把鞋脱了
Gotta take our shoes off.

551
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,020
我不想把鞋脱了
I don't want to take our shoes off.

552
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,080
你知道我什么意思吗
You know what I mean?

553
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,820
或许这个房子
Maybe it's one of those houses

554
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,490
也是那种你需要脱鞋的房子
where you have to take your shoes off.

555
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,950
-你好啊  -欢迎  女士们
- Hi. - Welcome, ladies.

556
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,870
我想你们会找到充足的电灯
I think you'll find ample electric light.

557
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,820
看看这些白人特权
Oh, look at all this white privilege.

558
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
你们自便
Help yourself.

559
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,590
这是我的妈妈  莉莉丝
This is my mom, Lilith.

560
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,820
你好啊
Hello, you, again.

561
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,580
-毕竟你让我的生活充满光彩  -谢谢你
- Well, you lit up my life. - Thank you.

562

-你帮我戒了烟  -好吧
- You helped me quit smoking. - Oh, well.

563
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,150
你们两个长得真像
You know the family resemblance is striking, you two.

564
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,990
我知道
Oh, I know.

565
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,700
{\an8}南非大主教

566
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,700
和德斯蒙德·图图的一夜改变了我的生活
Well, one night with Desmond Tutu changed my life forever.

567
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,720
真好笑  你真幽默
That's fun, you're fun.

568
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,700
-我们都很幽默  -是的

570
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,980
我很抱歉  艾格尼丝
I'm sorry-- Agnes?

571
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,420
我让她拿下来  因为这太恐怖了
You know, I asked her to take that down because it is so morbid.

572
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,920
-我喜欢  -我也是
- Oh, I like it. - Me too.

573
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,650
我也喜欢  当你后退一步的时候
I like it. Once you step back, you know,

574
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,080
就好像你让这些层次变得平易近人了
and you kind of let the folksy layers--

575
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,270
你叫我吗
You rang?

576
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,890
艾格尼丝  认识一下我们的客人
Agnes, please meet our guests.

577
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,920
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

578
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,210
她有点像《功夫熊猫》里的阿宝
Ah, she's a bit like Master Po from Kung Fu.

579
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,010
这样可以吗  好的
Is that okay? Good.

580
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,560
你好彼得  我是茉根
Hi Peter, I'm Morgan.

581
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,960
你好
Hello.

582
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,820
玛丽和我在德文郡徒步旅行时相遇
Marie and I met backpacking across Devon.

583
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,290
吃完最后一袋混合干果  我就过来了
Bonded over the last bag of trail mix and here I am.

584
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,100
用高雅的品味来丰富我的婚礼
Supplementing the nups with a touch of class.

585
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,560
-高雅  -这挺好的
- Touch. - Oh, that's nice.

586
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,670
我猜你一定得到了许多
I bet you've got tons of that

587
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,750
尽管你的身材很脆弱
despite your--your fragile stature.

588
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,580
很温馨的家
Lovely home.

589
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,410
谢谢你
Thank you.

590
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,370
从建筑上说
Architecturally speaking.

591
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,020
就风格而言  我不能说我真的喜欢
Style wise, I can't say I really care for it.

592
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,620
充其量算混乱
Muddled at best.

593
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,040
首先  这房子蠢极了
First of all, this house is stupid.

594
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,180
其次  你打不打算给我们吃的
Second, are you gonna feed us or what, papi?

595
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,960
因为你一定不想看见我饥饿的样子
Because you don't want to see me hangry.

596
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,240
都是你们
It's all you guys.

597
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,710
我不行
I can't.

598
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,290
这小东西很好吃
This little things are delicious.

599
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,150
好了
All right.

600
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,170
我要把这发到照片墙上
I've gotta Instagram this.

601
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,530
我会弄一些
And, um, I'm gonna get, like,

602
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,260
椅子套
chair covers.

603
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,470
那叫椅子保温罩
They're called chair cozies.

604
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,440
不不  婚礼椅子保温罩肯定很难看
No, no, wedding chair cozies can't look great.

605
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,890
豆袋坐垫更好
Fuckin' bean bags would be better.

606
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,830
在你们眼里我像梅格汉·马克尔[英国王妃]吗
Do I look like Meghan Markle to y'all?

607
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,620
这就是你为什么应该把婚礼
I mean, that's why you should just have the wedding in,

608
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,780
开在谷仓里的原因
like, a barn of something.

609
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,140
-谷仓  -不  不是真正的谷仓
- A barn? - But not, like, an actual barn.

610
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,290
我的天  忘了我刚才说的
Oh my God, forget I said anything.

611
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,580
彼得  你怎么看待婚礼椅子保温套的
Peter, how do you feel about wedding chair cozies?

612
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,560
-我吗  -是的
- Me? Uh, well... - Yeah.

613
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,490
实话跟你们说
...to be honest with you guys,

614
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,990
我根本不知道你们在说些什么
I have no idea what the gentle fuck you're talkin' about.

615
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,130
但我想知道一下
I want to know more though.

616
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,130
我想知道更多  继续说吧
I want to know more. Keep sharing.

617
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,510
如果你们愿意的话
For those of you willing,

618
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,070
你们接下来要享用的
what you're about to enjoy...

619
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,990
是煎安康鱼
is a pan-seared monkfish.

620
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,750
你们将会看到一些英国豌豆
You'll see some English peas.

621
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,800
很新鲜
Those are fresh.

622
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,570
天啊  太好看了
Oh my gosh, this is beautiful.

623
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,350
看起来像是鳕鱼
I mean, it looks like cod.

624
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,040
它们有相似点
There's a similarity.

625
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,490
艾琳娜
Uh, Elena,

626
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,840
但是它更高端一些
but, um, it's much higher end.

627
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,770
吃吧  吃吧
Y'all, eat up, eat up also,

628
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,000
因为这在他的饭店里很贵
because this is super expensive at his restaurant.

629
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,160
我和他分手的主要原因是
The reason I broke up with him mainly

630
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,220
因为他觉得他有权决定
was because he thought he got to decide

631
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,960
我要不要以及什么时候要孩子
when and if I had babies.

632
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,410
还有盐  对吗
But also the salt, no?

633
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,720
他连培根都要腌制
Also he salted his bacon.

634
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,090
这太难吃了
Oh, that's always gross.

635
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,930
-不是吧  -确实很恶心
- Fuck no. - Yeah, it was grim.

636
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,800
但我爱的人想要决定
But it wasn't as bad as the man I loved

637
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,280
我的身体什么时候改变
wanting to determine

638
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,430
什么时候有新生命从我身体里破壳而出
when my body transforms and bursts forth with...

639
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,540
-这样也不坏  -我的天哪
- suckling young. - Goodness gracious,

640
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,020
你说得好像是《阿基拉》的最后一幕  茉根
you make it sound like the last act of Akira, Morgan.

641
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,260
也没有那么糟
It's not that bad.

642
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,730
抱歉  彼得  你有过孩子吗
I'm sorry, Peter, have you birthed many children?

643
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,150
很遗憾  我还没有
Um, I haven't, unfortunately,

644
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,320
但我见过别人生孩子
but I did see it happen.

645
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,300
我亲自近距离目睹过
Listen, I saw it happen up close and personal,

646
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,630
我感觉如果我有那个小玩意
and I feel like if I had the gadgetry,

647
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,030
我会要孩子的
I would have delivered.

648
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,130
小玩意  大伙儿
The gadgetry, you guys.

649
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,440
不只是生孩子  对吗
You know, it's not just the delivery, right?

650
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,630
是接下来发生的一切
It's everything that comes next

651
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,660
和在那之后的一切
and then everything after that.

652
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,740
你说得对  抱歉  我忘了你想办法
You're right, I'm sorry, I forgot that you managed

653
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,840
略去了分娩的部分
to avoid the pushing part,

654
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,860
你真是太好了  很棒
which is so sweet for you, it's rad.

655
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,450
但我也接受领养  所以...
But I'm also a fan of adoption, so...

656
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,000
我只是说  我不觉得抚养一个小孩
No, I was just saying I don't think raising a child

657
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,540
应该是我们需要优先考虑的一个事
should be another thing we have to prioritize, you know?

658
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,000
这不是负担或是任务
It's not a burden or a task,

659
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,980
只是很简单的一件事
it's just simply what is.

660
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,560
就像呼吸一样  只是你生活的一部分
Becomes as much part of your life as breathing.

661
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,630
但你生活的一部分
But then the parts of your life

662
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,440
你之前觉得是你的生活
that you thought were your life,

663
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,480
比如社交或是创业
like socializing or career building,

664
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,260
探索及表达艺术
and, you know, exploring or expressing art,

665
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,970
这些事驱动你  定义你
those things that drove you and defined you,

666
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,850
所有的这些选项都没被选中
all those boxes get left unchecked.

667
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,140
当然他们还是很重要
Of course they still matter.

668
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,030
你们希望你的孩子长大之后
And you want your child to grow up

669
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,130
不仅仅是想当一名母亲
and see more than just Mom.

670
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,190
你想让他们成为一名梦想家或是爱人
You want them to see a dreamer and a lover

671
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,560
或是企业家之类的
and an entrepreneur or whatever.

672
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,540
你想让他们成为
You want them to see...

673
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,340
你
you.

674
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,630
或许会受到鼓舞
And maybe be inspired.

675
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,690
我的天  母亲节是什么时候  五月吗
Oh my God, when is Mother's Day, May?

676
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,400
该死
Fuck.

677
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,580
我成为了你
I see you.

678
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,500
我爱你
I love you.

679
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,310
这真是温馨的一幕
Well, that is a cockle warmer.

680
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,080
没感觉吗
No, nothing?

681
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,870
气氛很僵硬啊
Tough room.

682
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,900
各位  拜托  我开玩笑的
Guys, come on, I'm kidding.

683
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,830
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

684
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,080
这是一段美妙的独白  莉莉丝
That was a beautiful soliloquy, Lilith,

685
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,710
我觉得我们应该为此喝一杯
and I think that we should all drink to it.

686
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,210
我的天  彼得
Oh my God, Peter.

687
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,640
我的老天
Oh my goshness.

688
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,700
我让自己变得尴尬了
I've just embarrassed myself.

689
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,640
-幸亏你抓住了  -没事的
- Well--well caught. - It's okay.

690
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
我也很好奇
I'm also very curious

691
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,510
这是什么东西
as to what is-- what is that about?

692
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,300
这有点吸引我
That's intriguing.

693
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,770
这是什么
What this is about?

694
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,860
姐妹情谊
Sisterhood.

695
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,000
凯尔特风格  我说的对吗女士们
Celtic style, am I right, ladies?

696
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,750
那是2015年的狂欢节
It was about Mardi Gras 2015.

697
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,680
当时是羊年
Year of the motherfuckin' goat.

698
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,180
我喜欢我们的纹身
Oh, I love our tattoos.

699
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,330
我也是
Yeah, me too.

700
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,890
天啊  有人也出汗吗  像偷了东西一样
Oh, whoa, is anybody else sweating like they stole something?

701
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,440
艾琳娜  你怎么这么热
Elena, how are you hot?

702
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,710
-我不知道  -她总是这样
- I don't know. - She always is.

703
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:17,290
*去睡觉吧*
*Go to sleep*

704
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,250
*在掩盖之下*
*Underneath the cover*

705
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,800
外面有你喜欢的吗
See anything out there you like?

706
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,070
作为雇主对女佣说
Well, uh, speaking man to matron,

707
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,800
我可以说
I-- I could say

708
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,450
外面没有我不喜欢的
there's nothing out there I don't like.

709
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,760
你可真是包容啊
How inclusive of you.

710
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,700
谢谢你
Thank you.

711
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,180
但是实话实说
Truthfully, though,

712
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,070
我感觉我有点不会使用厨具了
I am feeling kind of invisible to housewares.

713
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,760
明智而不含糊其辞的话可能会有所帮助
Huh, wiser words without slurring might help.

714
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,210
或许别再瞎说八道了
Maybe stop spilling shit.

715
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,970
你的诚实没有底线  艾格尼丝
Your honesty is boundary free, Ags.

716
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,040
而我是真的醉了
And I am tipsy.

717
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,940
天啊  吃点东西吧
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

718
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,180
好
Well, sure.

719
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,770
悠着点  我不会替你收拾你的烂摊子了
Go easy, I'm not gonna clean up any more of your messes.

720
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,400
-给你  -谢谢你
- Here. - Thank you.

721
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,280
谢谢你  又加热了一遍
Thank you, mm, reheated.

722
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,730
顺便说一句  我很喜欢你和你的粥
BTDubs, I'm a big fan of you and your porridge.

723
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,990
-我喜欢  -谢了
- I like that. - Yeah, thanks.

724
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,860
你上次正经和姑娘们一起潇洒是什么时候了
Yeah, when is the last time you had a solid girls' night out?

725
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,460
我觉得你该出去
I feel like you should get out there,

726
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,080
告诉她们关于埃莉诺·罗斯福的八卦
tell 'em some shit about Eleanor Roosevelt,

727
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,050
你懂我的意思吗
you know what I'm saying?

728
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,330
也许跟她们说说第一个吸尘器的故事
Maybe tell 'em the story of the first vacuum.

729
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,010
你真是个傻子
You're an idiot.

730
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,720
*面具之下*
*Underneath the cover*

731
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,940
真是太好听了
That's-- that's gorgeous.

732
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,300
谁想要奶油或牛奶
Anybody need cream or milk?

733
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,560
就告诉我
Just let me know.

734
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,600
我的天  艾格尼丝
My gosh, Agnes!

735
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,820
你都忙一天了
You've been on your feet all day.

736
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,230
不如你坐会歇歇
Why don't you sit down, take a load off?

737
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,310
也许传授点知识
Maybe drop some knowledge.

738
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,490
我太老了  传授什么都不好使了
I'm too old to be dropping anything.

739
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,870
我只是很享受看到姐妹们团聚
I'm just enjoying the festivities watching some sisters commune.

740
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,310
她来了
Oh, there she is.

741
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,900
选举权
Suffrage.

742
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,340
我的最爱
My day.

743
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,080
都不喜欢吗  好吧
No? Okay.

744
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,880
其实你们都很幸运
Truth is, you all are lucky.

745
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,810
女人互相依靠并不是件易事
Wasn't always this easy for women to lean on each other.

746
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,690
在那个时代
There was a time when it...

747
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,620
没有人在意女人的心声
wasn't about choosing to be heard,

748
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,980
因为你无法发声
because you had no voice.

749
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,680
如果不曾拥有  又如何使用
How can you use something you were never given?

750
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,650
女人遭受的痛苦都会在你们心中留下烙印
Something terrible happens to a woman and it just lives in you.

751
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,220
在她心中
In her.

752
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,180
首先侵蚀你的内心  然后蔓延至皮肤
Starts on the inside and then it becomes her skin

753
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,080
直到她死去  都会留有印记
and she wears it till she dies and that's that.

754
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,150
刚才她只是在热身  姑娘们
And that was just her tight five, ladies.

755
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,260
等着看今年秋天Hulu台特别节目上映吧
Wait, just wait until her Hulu special drops this fall.

756
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,580
我为女士们做了巧克力
I made chocolate things for women.

757
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,710
-请别一下子...  -谢了  老兄
- Please don't all just... - I'm good, bro.

758
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,000
-好  -也许等会吧  谢了  彼得
- Yeah. - Maybe later, Peter. Thanks.

759
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,820
看上去像野花
They look like wild flavors.

760
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,380
对  没错
Oh, yeah. Yes.

761
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,810
你还好吗  彼得
You all right over there, Pete?

762
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,290
还行
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,400
我就是  也许酒喝多了
I just-- I maybe had a little too much to drink

764
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,230
吃的太少
and not enough to eat.

765
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,320
这就是  就是厨师的诅咒
This is the-- this is the chef's curse.

766
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,460
恕我失陪一下
Hey, I'll bid you excuse me.

767
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,900
恕我不奉陪
I'll bid you adieu.

768
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,590
你们想待多久都行
Um, stay as long as you like, okay?

769
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,100
如果愿意可以住下来
Stay the night if you like.

770
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,830
午夜时分我可以来点侧卧相拥
I will be available for some light spooning during the witching hour,

771
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,380
只要我可以做外侧的那个人
as long as I can be the big spoon.

772
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,760
彼得  很感谢你的好意
Peter, your hospitality is greatly appreciated.

773

谢谢你和艾格尼丝做的美味晚餐
Thank you and Agnes for such a delicious meal.

774
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,360
我有重力
I had this gravity.

775
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,510
那里有台阶
There's a step there.

776
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,780
-晚安  -好

你好啊
Cheerio.

779
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,800
幸好还活着
Well, that's good.

780
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,630
我们喝了多少酒
Hey, how much did we drink?

781
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,470

我喜欢你的外套  但是
I do like your outfit, but...

797
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:15,790
你在这干什么
why are you here?

798
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,930
你是来借宿
Are you a boarder

799
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,590
还是只是探望艾格尼丝
or are you just visiting Agnes?

坚强点  哥们
Stiff upper lip, mate.

我没法想象
I just can't imagine

848
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,310
现在你心里的想法
what's running through your head right now.

849
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,490
无需想像  我可以直接告诉你
Oh, you don't need to, I can tell you, it's, uh,

850
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,660
"为什么我他妈的动不了"
"Why can't I move my fuckin' body"

851
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,400
还有"赶紧把这个项圈从我脖子上摘了"
and "Get this collar off me fuckin' now."

852
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,440
别爆粗口
Language!

853

你以为自己是谁
Who do you think you are?

854
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,580
我以为自己是谁
Who do you think I am?

855
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,050
我很意外你没认出我  彼得
I'd say I'm surprised you don't recognize me, Peter,

856
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,040
但说实话  上次见你时我还是个孩子
but to be fair, I was a child the last time you were around.

857
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,560
不过大家都说  我和我姐长得一模一样
Still, everyone says I'm the spitting image of my sister, and, well,

858
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,100
我知道你肯定记得她
I know you remember her.

859
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,640
我完全不知道你在说什么
I have no idea who you're talking about.

860
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,360
惠勒
Wheeler.

861
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,410
卡拉·惠勒
Kara Wheeler.

862
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,900
你是贝卡的妹妹
You're Becca's sister?

863
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:43,670
曾是
Was.

864
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,820
原来这些疯狂举动都是为了她
So that's what all this insanity is about.

865
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,420
她是自杀的
She took the easy way out.

866
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,820
这还是我的错
It's my fault?

867
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,760
你姐姐的死是一场悲剧
What happened to your sister is tragic.

868
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,490
真的
Truly.

869
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,720
也非常懦弱
It's also fuckin' cowardly.

870
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,690
不是吗  你的父母怎么办
Right? What about your parents?

871
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,550
你怎么办
What about you?

872
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,220
还有海洛因
And then the heroin.

873
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,980
海洛因  卡拉
The fuckin' heroin, Kara.

874
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,660
拜托  我知道你很生气
Come on, I know you're angry.

875
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,040
你想要些安慰  但这个
You want some closure, but this,

876
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,160
这样你得不到慰藉
this is not the way to get it.

877
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,920
这样你将面临十到二十年的牢狱之灾
This... this is how you get 10 to 20.

878
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,610
你知道是我发现了她的尸体吗
Did you know I was the one that found her?

879
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,020
她用了你的烹饪刀  彼得
She used a knife from your line of cutlery, Peter.

880
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,810
就是在你的狗屁电视节目上出售的那种
The very set you sell on your piece-of-shit TV show.

881
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,430
你以为那是个巧合吗
Do you think that was a coincidence?

882
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,880
当时我们只是青少年  卡拉
We were teenagers, okay, Kara?

883
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,910
无论你以为发生了什么
And whatever you're thinking,

884
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,260
该死  我保证
fuck, I guarantee you

885
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,970
事情不是那样  好吗
that's not what happened, all right?

886
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,080
时间正好
Right on cue.

887
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,140
-好样的  -该死
- All right. - Shit.

888
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,640
好
Okay.

889
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,060
那是什么玩意
Uh, what the hell is that?

890
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,000
别担心  还没装上弓呢
Don't worry, it's not loaded.

891
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,680
现在装上了
Right, then, now that it's loaded,

892
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,290
如果我是你  我就会担心
I would be worried, if I were you.

893
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,240
什么玩意
What the fuck?

894
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,460
我了个去
Holy shit.

895
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,890
你看上去很紧张  彼得
You seem tense, Peter.

896
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,300
说得好  老大
Way to represent, OG.

897
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,260
这样也不坏
Suckling young.

898
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,660
天啊
Oh my God.

899
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,230
好吧  你们都是疯子
Okay, okay, okay, so you are all crazy,

900
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,450
你们都疯了
you're all just crazy,

901
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,460
你们的大脑有问题
and your brains are sick,

902
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,930
你们会因此受到惩罚的
and you're not gonna get away with this,

903
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,190
你们这些愤怒的婊子
you... angry bitches!

904
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,160
彼得
Oh, Peter.

905
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,540
我们不是愤怒的婊子
We're not angry bitches.

906
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,950
我们是愤怒的女巫
We're angry witches.

907
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,700
艾格尼丝
Agnes!

908
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,520
艾格尼丝
Agnes!

909
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,020
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

910
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,590
瘫痪
The paralysis.

911
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,910
这是个补充咒  但总是很有效
It's a remedial spell but always quite effective.

912
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,620
容我失陪一下  彼得
Now, if you'll excuse me, Peter,

913
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,220
一个女人总有很多事要做
a woman's work is never, ever done.

914
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:04,800
艾格尼丝
Agnes!

915
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,540
救救我
Help me!

916
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,820
给自己留点自尊  小瘦子
Have some self-respect, Slim.

917
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,610
你们在干什...
What are you...

918
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,840
你们在计划什么
What are you planning?

919
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,560
你们在干什...
What are you...

920
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,880
你们怎么回事
Hey, what is your deal, even... huh?

921
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,810
那是什么  那是什么
Yeah? What is that-- what is that--

922
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,760
你们刚才交换的那个眼神
what is that nonverbal cue, huh?

923
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,700
你们根本没在帮我
You guys aren't helping me at all, please.

924
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,300
我们不能让你这样出来
We can't let you go out like this.

925
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:35,160
出门
Out?

926
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,930
别害怕
Don't sweat it.

927
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,210
我们要打理一下你
We're gonna tighten you up.

928
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,160
你们要帮我打理
You're gonna tighten me up,

929
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,980
什么打理  打理什么
what is tighten-- tighten what up?

930
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,140
所有一切
All of it.

931
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,530
拜托
Oh, come on.

932
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,790
别动
Shh, stay very still.

933
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,690
不  不不  不能这样了
No! No, no, this stops now.

934
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,240
*闭嘴闭嘴闭嘴闭嘴*
*Shut, shut, shut, shut*

935
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,430
*闭上你的臭嘴*
*Shut your fucking mouth*

936
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,300
*没人想听你的废话*
*No one wants to hear your bullshit*

937
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,920
*闭上你的臭嘴*
*Shut your fucking mouth*

938
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,780
-不  不  -天哪
- No! No. - Oh, boy.

939
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,750
不错
That's good.

940
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,350
不
No.

941
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,180
天哪
Oh, God.

942
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,770
操
Oh, f...

943
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,100
该死
Oh, shit!

944
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,160
毒蛇给蛇蝎
Snake for snake.

945
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,100
你们都不认识我
You don't even know me.

946
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,610
你们不认识我  你们只知道
You don't know me, all you know is

947
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,050
搜索引擎里读到的那些
what you read in the search engine.

948
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,000
非常感谢能给我这个独家采访
Thank you so much for this exclusive.

949
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,660
说实话  我是你的忠实粉丝
Confession? I'm a big fan,

950
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,460
但这采访只是工作
But this is just business.

951
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,150
阿谀奉承能给你开很多门
Well, flattery'll get you everywhere.

952
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,730
我的工作就是我的快乐之源
My business is my pleasure.

953
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,140
这是什么
What is this?

954
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,100
-好极了  -没错
- Um... great. - Yeah!

955
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,480
那我们开始吧
So let's get started, okay.

956
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,950
你与食物
When did your love affair

957
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,420
何时结下了情缘
with food start?

958
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,860
不如你直接问我你真正想问的问题
Why don't you ask me what you really wanna ask me?

959
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,160
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

960
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,070
好吧  我操了  别这样
Okay, fuck no, you guys, come on.

961
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,520
你们是一家人  老天
You're family, for Christ's sake.

962
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,580
这简直错得太离谱了  怎么
This is wrong on so many levels, what it--

963
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,370
怎么回事
what is happening?

964
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,610
别  我们能不能
Oh-- oh please, can we just,

965
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,430
能不能就专注采访
stick to the interview?

966
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,320
别装了  这就是采访
Come on, this is the interview.

967
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,740
听着  我...
Look, I--I...

968
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,820
我们能不能专业点
can we just keep it on the level?

969
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,040
-好啊  -我真的不喜欢
- Yeah, yeah. - I'm really not comfortable

970
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,980
-你这样...  -好吧好吧
- with where this is-- - Okay, okay, hey.

971
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,780
真的吗
Seriously?

972
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,320
你争取这个独家新闻多久了
How long you been chasing this exclusive?

973
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,430
你到底写给谁看
I mean, who the fuck do you write for?

974
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,880
有谁读你这玩意  拜托
Who's reading this shit? Come on.

975
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,120
不不  你们这些混蛋
No, no, no, no, you assholes.

976
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:10,560
我是你成名的机会  我是你成名的机会
I'm your brass ring. I'm your brass ring.

977
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,960
不不  事情不是这样的
No, that's not how it happened.

978
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,150
事情不是这样的
That's not how it happened.

979
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,150
你们能不能消停会
This-- can you please cut that out?

980
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,110
别演了
Cut--cut that out.

981
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,080
贱人
Ow! Cunt!

982
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,690
你他妈咬了我
You fucking bit me!

983
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,870
暂停
Unquote.

984
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,450
她根本不想和你上床  彼得
She don't wanna fuck you, Peter.

985
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,210
虽然她是你的粉丝
Just because she's a fan of your work

986
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,040
但不意味着你能碰她
doesn't mean you get to touch her.

987
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:38,890
这里  或者这里
Here, or here...

988
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,440
不可以
It's not okay.

989
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,880
从来都不可以
It's never been okay.

990
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:45,950
看看奶子
Look at the tits.

991
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,700
看看奶子  兄弟
Check the tits, bro.

992
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,410
不如我告诉你们疯女人
Hey, how about a giant obvious newsflash

993
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,280
一个显而易见的道理
for you two certifiable loony bins:

994
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,860
每个故事都有两面  懂吗
There's two sides to every story, okay?

995
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,500
她为了这个独家新闻争取了好几周
She chased that exclusive for weeks.

996
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,220
-她在酒吧和我见面  -是你让她去的
- She met me at a bar. - You told her to meet you there!

997
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,210
她带了一个录音笔
She brought a recorder

998
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,360
和一个笔记薄
and a fucking legal pad!

999
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,540
一整晚她都在拼命和我调情
She flirted her ass off with me the whole time.

1000
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,270
之后她竟然还有胆咬我
And then, she had the balls to bite me,

1001
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:09,980
因为她就是个疯婆子
because she was a crazy bitch!

1002
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:13,570
你想见识下真正疯狂的东西吗
You wanna see something really fucking crazy?

1003
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,370
老天
Oh boy.

1004
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,050
怎么回事
What's happening?

1005
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,130
你惹女巫生气了  彼得
You pissed off a witch, Peter.

1006
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,900
-而且玛丽还是伏都教  所以  -该死
- And Marie fucks with voodoo, so... - Oh, shit.

1007
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:40,430
天哪  天哪  救救我  救救我吧
Oh God. Oh God, help me. Please, please help me.

1008
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,230
还不行  玛丽
Not yet, Marie.

1009
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,510
时候未到
It's too soon.

1010
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,050
-他自找的  -我知道
- He fucking asked for it. - I have no doubt.

1011
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,280
你现在是真的时日无多了
You are officially on borrowed time.

1012
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,350
天哪  快看
Oh boy, look at that.

1013
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,210
看看你干的好事
Look what you did.

1014
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,060
你尿床了
You pissed yourself.

1015
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,960
现在你只能躺在自己的尿里
Now you're gonna have to lay there in your own sauce

1016
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,750
而我还得闻着
and I'm gonna have to smell it.

1017
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,730
但你还是很幸运
Still, you're lucky.

1018
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,260
我本不会阻止她
I wouldn't have stopped her.

1019
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,070
她的烈性子简直让我神魂颠倒
All that spitfire just makes me melt.

1020
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,110
不然我为什么向她求婚呢
Why do you think I asked her to marry me?

1021
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:43,130
她就是我的梦中情人
She checks all my boxes.

1022
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,090
-真恶心  -不好意思
- That is disgusting. - Oh, I'm sorry.

1023
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:46,910
这个对你来说太重口了吗
Is that a bridge too far?

1024
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,240
该死  所以一切都是谎言吗
Oh, shit! So it's just all lies, huh?

1025
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,380
天哪  你都没有孩子
God, you don't even have a kid.

1026
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,760
别傻了
Don't be ridiculous.

1027
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,270
我女儿去年以优异成绩毕业
My daughter graduated cum laude last year,

1028
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,910
还是在那次袭击之后
and that was after the assault.

1029
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,990
幸运的是  那个禽兽还能如鱼得水
Luckily, that monster was still able to play in a bowl game.

1030
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,470
丝毫没有受到任何影响
Hasn't seemed to have affected his draft status one bit.

1031
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,780
感谢上帝她有勇气站出来
Thank God she had the courage to come forward.

1032
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:13,850
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

1033
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,020
给你敷上
There we go.

1034
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,230
等待第二幕
Stick around for act two.

1035
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,460
到那时我们再阉了你
That's when we castrate you.

1036
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,270
不准偷看
No peeking!

1037
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:01,910
你好啊
¡Hola!

1038
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,400
真是个
That's a nice--

1039
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,230
这颜色真不错
that's a nice color.

1040
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,610
我很高兴你喜欢
Oh, I'm so glad you like it!

1041
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,920
我们觉得这颜色很配你的肤色
We thought it would look good with your skin tone.

1042
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,800
你准备好变身为漂亮彼得了吗
You ready to become Pretty Peter?

1043
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,270
你准备好戴着手铐脚链回菲律宾了吗
Are you excited to head back to the Philippines in shackles?

1044
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,000
这个混球  你知道我是波多黎各人
Wow. This motherfucker-- you know I'm Puerto Rican!

1045
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,960
你想谈谈手铐吗
You wanna talk about shackles?

1046
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,190
当波多黎各还是西班牙殖民地时
You know, when Puerto Rico was still a Spanish colony,

1047
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,170
根本没有女权这一说
women's rights were unheard of

1048
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,880
而她们对岛上的社会贡献非常受限
and their contributions to the island's society were limited,

1049
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,320
委婉地说
to put it mildly.

1050
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,070
尽管波多黎各女人积极参与
Even though Puerto Rican women were actively participating

1051
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,350
反抗西班牙人
in the revolt against the Spaniards,

1052
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:50,280
但没人比西班牙人更擅长强奸和掠夺
and nobody can rape and pillage like the Spanish,

1053
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,110
不是吗
am I right?

1054
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,440
放松
Relax.

1055
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,610
我在给你上妆
I'm just texturizing.

1056
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,720
-你能撅嘴吗  -你能食屌吗
- Will you pout, please? - Will you eat a dick?

1057
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,660
好粗鲁
That's rude.

1058
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,950
信不信由你
Believe it or not,

1059
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,450
我可是个正宗的美国人
I'm as American as apple-motherfucking-pie.

1060
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,150
我的曾祖母为国而战
My great-grandmother served our great country

1061
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,410
与希特勒和他的盟军打仗
in the war against Hitler and his allies.

1062
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,620
多么爱国啊
What a patriot!

1063
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,800
我很抱歉这份勇气没遗传给你
I'm sorry that the courage skipped your generation.

1064
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,120
但我感激她的奉献  真的
But I am grateful for her service, truly.

1065
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,190
是吗
Are you?

1066
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,050
就像你很感激
The way you're grateful for the service of,

1067
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,530
你的女性员工的付出吗
I don't know, your female kitchen staff?

1068
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,010
你听说过同工同酬吗
You ever hear of equal pay for equal work,

1069
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,800
你这个垃圾
you pasty piece of shit?

1070
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,850
你睡过多少个手下
And how many of them have you slept with, huh?

1071
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,710
包括你开除的那个
Including the one you fired.

1072
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,360
玛塔·多明戈斯
Marta Dominguez.

1073
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,680
单亲妈妈  两个孩子
Single mother of two,

1074
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,340
不过在你看来  这个世界已经有
and that was enough brown babies for this world,

1075
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,900
够多的棕色宝宝了
as far as you were concerned.

1076
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,110
这是我们共同的决定
Yeah, we came to that decision together.

1077
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:51,190
共同
Together?

1078
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,760
那为什么要给封口费
Then why settle?

1079
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,470
你给了她两万吧
That one cost you 20 grand.

1080
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,440
为一个员工花这么多钱可是大手笔
Big money for one of your employees.

1081
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,270
你不该这样做吧  茉根
Isn't this beneath you, Morgan?

1082
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,510
你们不是发明礼仪的吗
Didn't you people invent manners?

1083
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:07,890
他是说英国
He means the English.

1084
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,960
这些都不是从那儿传过来的
None of this shit flies across the Pond.

1085
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,020
这些都是美式最下作的手段
This is strictly American awfulness at its worst.

1086
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,640
首先  彼得
First of all, Peter,

1087
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,710
你这辈子做的下作事
the utter shite that you've been doing

1088
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,790
基本堪比全球性的霍乱了
your entire life is part of an international pandemic.

1089
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,990
-说得好  -第二
- Ooh, good word. - Yeah. And second,

1090
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:24,710
你知道该死的巫术
do you know a thing about fuckin' witchcraft

1091
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,080
和该死的起源吗
and its fuckin' origins?

1092
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,240
拜托  我...我想和你进行正常的交流
Nice. Come on, I'm... trying to talk to you like a human,

1093
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,430
但你却嘲讽我  还想个恶霸一样
and you're mocking me and you're wrapping your finger

1094
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,170
把手指扣在扳机上
around a trigger like a bully.

1095
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,380
你害怕的时候真的很无能
You're a real wanker when you're frightened,

1096
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,240
你知道吗
do you know that?

1097
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,590
我的确很害怕  茉根
Yeah, I'm frightened, Morgan.

1098
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,730
我很害怕  因为我被绑架了  而且
I'm scared, 'cause I've been kidnapped and...

1099
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,930
被陌生人
accused,

1100
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,060
指控  定罪  处刑  我...
and convicted and sentenced by strangers, and I--

1101
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,870
我有一个叫莱利的女儿
I have a daughter named Riley.

1102
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,280
但是  彼得
Yeah, but Peter,

1103
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:57,100
摧毁现有的规则就会带来巨大的改变
great change comes with the destruction of existing rules.

1104
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,030
什么
What?

1105
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:00,760
我妹妹的皮肤和我一样
My sister's skin is my own,

1106
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,340
我妹妹的心和我一样
my sister's heart is my own,

1107
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,560
我妹妹的未来和我一样
and my sister's future is my own.

1108
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,060
该死  她还是个新人
Oh, shit, she's in training, huh?

1109
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,830
这是你第一次  对吗
This is your first time, isn't it?

1110
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:17,120
做梦去吧
In your dreams.

1111
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,780
不  我现在可不是做梦
No, not in my dreams, right now.

1112
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,970
我了解你
I know you.

1113
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,870
我和你一起长大
I grew up with you.

1114
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,440
茉根
Morgan.

1115
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,050
你就像是我的妹妹
You're just like my sister.

1116
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,520
你渴望被人所接受
You're desperate for acceptance.

1117
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,660
我有个哥哥
I have a brother.

1118
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,850
他会做奶酪洋葱三明治
He makes cheese-and-onion sandwiches

1119
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,220
他们就爱到发狂
and they're the tits.

1120
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,490
他的鞋子就是擦不亮
You still couldn't shine his shoes.

1121
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,430
是谁摧毁了你的自尊
Who was it that destroyed your self-esteem so completely

1122
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,590
让你愿意
that you are willing

1123
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:46,990
加入有史以来都烂的姐妹会
to pledge the worst sorority in history?

1124
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,400
是你爸爸吗
Was it your dad?

1125
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,100
够了  蠢蛋
That's enough, pendejo.

1126
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,380
每个混蛋都会说
Every asshole says he's an asshole

1127
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,870
因为爸爸是混蛋所以自己才变成混蛋
because his father was an asshole.

1128
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,830
别被他的话迷惑了
No te dejes que te meta en la cabeza.

1129
01:01:58,830 --> 01:01:59,990
这只是他的把戏
It's just dead skin.

1130
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:01,780
茉根  拜托
Morgan, come on.

1131
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:03,910
这辈子为你自己
Make one decision for yourself

1132
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,270
-决定一次  -操你妈的
- in your life. - Fuck you!

1133
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,240
你对我的这辈子一点都不了解
You know nothing about my life!

1134
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,130
欢迎加入我们  贱人
Welcome to the fucking game, bitch!

1135
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:12,930
该死
Oh, shit!

1136
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,260
星号  六  九
Star... six... nine.

1137
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,650
-喂  -朗尼  我是彼得
- Hello? - Lonnie-- Lonnie, it's Peter.

1138
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,920
我被女巫们绑架了
I'm a hostage of witches.

1139
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,800
我报过警了  打不通  你能相信...
I tried 911 already, it's busy, can you believe--

1140
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,670
你这样只会让你自己更痛苦  彼得
You just made this a lot more painful for yourself, Peter.

1141
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,430
朗尼
Lonnie?

1142
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,770
我是叫这个名字  别忘了
That's my name, don't wear it out.

1143
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,740
天啊  这么晚了  你真是
God, it's so late, you freaked me out there

1144
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,690
吓了我一跳
for a second.

1145
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:31,530
没错
Right.

1146
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,410
我不住在这里的
I don't live here.

1147
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,660
彼得邀请我们几位女士来共进晚餐
Peter invited us ladies over for dinner.

1148
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,100
我们没电了  他可怜我们
Our power went out and he took pity on us.

1149
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,880
彼得给我店里打了个电话
Peter called me at the shop,

1150
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,640
他听起来很惊慌
he sounded pretty shook up.

1151
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,280
朗尼  彼得没事
Lonnie, Peter's fine.

1152
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,940
他只是骗你的
He was just yanking your chain.

1153
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,660
就像我们小时候那样
Like when we were kids?

1154
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,710
-但是我们不是小孩子了  -他是个恶霸  朗尼
- Oh, but we're not kids anymore. - He was a bully, Lonnie.

1155
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,460
我很遗憾  他之前一直都让你觉得你...
I'm sorry if he ever made you feel like you were--

1156
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,160
很蠢吗
Dumb?

1157
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,980
-我不蠢  -我知道
- I'm not dumb. - I know you're not.

1158
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:09,850
如果你真的指望我相信
Hmm, you probably should turned more lights on,

1159
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,220
你们在里面共进晚餐
if you really wanted me to believe

1160
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,170
那你们最好多开点灯
that you were inside having supper.

1161
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,220
我要进去看一看
I'll come in and take a look around.

1162
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,400
朗尼
Lonnie...

1163
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,920
回家吧  孩子
Go home, boy.

1164
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,140
-这与你无关  -母亲
- This doesn't concern you. - Mother...

1165
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,250
交给我吧  回床上去
I got this handled, go on back to bed.

1166
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,430
我和你怎么说的来着
What did I tell you about that thing, huh?

1167
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,340
我怎么说的
What'd I say?

1168
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,560
这里有点不对劲
Something's not right here.

1169
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,870
-你爱你的母亲吗  -当然了
- You love your mother? - 'Course I do.

1170
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,010
好吧
All right.

1171
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,780
那就收好这个  回家
Then you take this and you go home.

1172
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,110
一切都在掌控之中
Everything's under control.

1173
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,940
你忘记你自己来过这里
You just forget you were ever here.

1174
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:24,680
你出现的时机正好
Your timing is impeccable.

1175
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,460
彼得知道吗
Does Peter know?

1176
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:32,520
彼得和格温自己当时都只是孩子
Peter and Gwen were just babies themselves.

1177
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,730
你为什么要保守这个秘密
Why'd you have to keep it a secret?

1178
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,330
因为苹果不会落到离树很远的地方
Because the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

1179
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:43,520
天啊
Oh my God.

1180
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,800
彼得的父亲
Peter's father?

1181
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:55,050
回去了结你自己挑起的事
Go back in there and finish what you started.

1182
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,210
不要再搞砸了
And no more fuck-ups.

1183
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,030
伙计  搞什么
Hey, man. What the fuck?

1184
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,580
这可不大好
That was enlightening.

1185
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,140
把钥匙给我  交给我
Gimme the keys, I'll take care of it.

1186
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:14,790
猎枪给我
I'll call shotgun. 

1187
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,040
这都没必要
None of that will be necessary.

1188
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:16,850
真的吗
Oh, oh, really?

1189
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:18,320
跟我的额头说去
Tell that to my fucking forehead.

1190
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,650
我们应该施更强的咒语
We should've cast a stronger spell.

1191
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,990
我们低估了你
We actually underestimated you.

1192
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,970
笼内训练结束了
Crate training's over.

1193
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,720
布谷  布谷
Oh, cuckoo, cuckoo!

1194
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,830
-这配色真不错  -我喜欢
- What a beautiful color. - Yeah, I like the way

1195
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,260
你穿这件衣服后立起来的奶头  宝贝
your titties look in that top, baby.

1196
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:47,310
有必要吗
Look, really?

1197
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:48,800
穿你妹妹的衣服
Your sister's clothes?

1198
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,730
她不是已经入土了吗
I mean, isn't she rolling in her grave?

1199
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,140
我们要进行女巫捕猎
We're going on a witch hunt.

1200
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,380
你懂吗  层次不一样
You get it? Levels.

1201
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,240
应该是我们来捕猎你
It's really more of us hunting you

1202
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,790
而不是你捕猎我们
as opposed to you hunting us.

1203
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,650
对经典的反转
It's a twist on an old classic.

1204
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:02,670
走吧  外国佬
Vámonos, gringo. -

1205

快跑  彼得
Go, Pe-ter!

1207
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,120
我能直接射他吗
Can I just shoot him in the bollocks? 

1208
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,170
-快跑  彼得  -拜托
- Go Peter, go! Oh! Come on!

1209
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,730
拜托  拜托
Please, please.

1210
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,530
不要这样  她的在天之灵看着呢
Please stop this. She had a soul.

1211
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,850
-十  -你还是快跑吧  小伙子
- Ten... - You better run, boy.

1212
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,190
好吧  抱歉
Hey! Okay, sorry.

1213
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,190

1216

该死
Sh-- shit.

1217
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,850

{\an8}火焰亦是欲火

1221
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,240
彼得

1222
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,210
当时我们只是青少年
We were teenagers,

1223
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,030
好吗

1224
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,750

Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

1233
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,520
你穿的是什么东西

你知道卡拉吗  她的妹妹

她们一直在跟踪我
And they've been following me,

1247
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,410
她们知道我的一些非常非常深的秘密

操
Fuck!

1253
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,400
她们会修复好你  不是解决你
I said they could fix you, not "Fix" You.

1254
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,760
你刚刚说什么
What in the living shit did you just say to me?

1255
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:38,050
你听得很清楚
You heard me.

1256
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,420
这都是你干的
You did this to me?

1257
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,100
-格温  -我也不想的
- Gwen-- - I didn't want to!

1258
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,800
好吗  但是你让我别无选择
Okay? But you just-- you left me no choice,

1259
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,710
因为历史又一次重演了
because it's happening all over again, and--

1260
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,260
没错  你继续难受吧
Oh yeah, you better be upset.

1261
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,240
因为你让我留下了一辈子的阴影
'Cause you have scarred me for life

1262
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,850
你可是我的妹妹

1263
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,900
没错  你就是在我们的树屋里
Yeah, I was your sister when you raped my best friend

1264
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,900
强奸了我最好的朋友
in our fucking treehouse!

1265
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:05,050
强奸  你说我"强奸"
Rape? Did you just say "Rape" To me?

1266
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,710
上帝啊  格温  我都不知道
Holy shit, Gwen, I don't even know

1267
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:10,440
这个词到底是什么意思
what that fuckin' word means anymore.

1268
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,080
没有人知道  好吗
Nobody does, okay?

1269
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,210
我们当时还是孩子
We were kids.

1270
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,970
我才十几岁  我喝醉了
I was a teenager, I was drunk,

1271
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:18,130
我光着身子  那感觉都是上辈子的事了
I was fuckin' naked, it was a blurry mess

1272
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,510
一片模糊
that happened a lifetime ago!

1273
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,300
不  对你来说是一片模糊  彼得
No, it's a blurry mess to you, Peter.

1274
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,540
对你来说是上辈子的事
It's a lifetime ago to you!

1275
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:28,180
-我说了  我醉了  -不
- Like I said, I was drunk. - No!

1276
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:32,320
不  你永远有借口  彼得
No, you always have an excuse, Peter,

1277
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,470
你永远能逃脱
and you always get away with it,

1278
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,230
不仅仅是贝卡
and it is not just with Becca,

1279
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,670
因为还有太多其他受害者
because there have been too many others,

1280
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,890
那个几年前
what about the journalist that interviewed you

1281
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:42,080
采访你的记者呢  你对她做了什么
a few years ago, right? Hm, what did you do to her?

1282
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,660
彼得  或者你的那个员工
Huh, Peter? Or the women on your staff,

1283
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,320
或者你的律师
or the new one that your lawyer's

1284
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,020
最近在给你处理的那个  
fixing for you right now, what were the--

1285
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,560
这次的辞退令是怎么写的
what were the marching orders this time?

1286
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,010
"她来面试真人秀
Is it "Oh, she auditioned for a reality show,

1287
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,450
那她肯定是个拜金的婊子"  对吗
so she just must be a gold-digging whore," Right?

1288
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,250
这不是你们公司的信条吗
Isn't that the company line?

1289
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:03,120
你伤害了贝卡
You hurt Becca

1290
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,680
没有人相信她的说法
and no one believed her story,

1291
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,460
因为你那么完美  彼得
because you were perfect, Peter,

1292
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,290
你说她是骗子  于是她就变成了骗子
and you called her a liar, so that's what she was.

1293
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:16,470
后来  她就慢慢被吞噬了
And over time, it just ate her alive.

1294
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,260
我维护你
And I defended you

1295
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,190
是因为你是我的哥哥
because you're my brother,

1296
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,910
不是因为我相信你  我不信
not because I believed you, because I didn't.

1297
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,700
这就是我要背负的罪孽
And that's just my cross to bear.

1298
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,660
好吧  你...
Yeah, okay, you're...

1299
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,740
你说得对
you're right.

1300
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,560
对不起
I'm sorry.

1301
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,050
你得赶紧开车  赶紧开车走
You have to drive right now. You have to drive right now!

1302
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:58,040
她们是该死的女巫
They're fuckin' witches!

1303
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,470
-她们没告诉你她们是女巫吗  -彼得  别说了
- Did they tell you they're fuckin' witches?   -No, Peter! Stop it!

1304
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,830
听听你自己说的话
Listen to yourself!

1305
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:06,510
搞什么  好吧
What the fuck? Okay.

1306
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:08,210
她们没和我说过这个
They did not say anything about that.

1307
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,990
-我要打给卡拉  -不  不要
- I'm gonna call Kara, and-- - No-- no, don't!

1308
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:13,010
那就是卡拉
That's Kara!

1309
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,800
不  不
No! No!

1310
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:28,070
彼得  救我  彼得  彼得
Peter, help me! Peter! Peter!

1311
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,620
格温  格温
Gwen! Gwen!

1312
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,420
我...我的手
Oh, my... my hands...

1313
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,850
不  不
No! No!

1314
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,210
不
Ah! No!

1315
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,170
不
Noo!

1316
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,010
格温  你在吗
Gwen, are you here?

1317
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,770
早上好  亲爱的
Good morning, dear.

1318
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,390
-我妹妹呢  -你真好
- Where's my sister? - That's sweet.

1319
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:17,800
格温在自己的床上醒来
Gwen woke up in her own bed.

1320
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,710
她不会记得在这里发生的事  所以
She'll have no memory of what happened here, so

1321
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:23,610
除非你想让她或者其他人
unless you want her or anyone else, for that matter,

1322
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,700
认为你应该被送进精神病院
to think you belong in an asylum,

1323
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,650
我建议你把我们之间的小小冒险
I suggest you take our little adventure

1324
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,180
带入坟墓  永不再提
with you to the grave.

1325
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,200
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

1326
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:37,900
为了贝卡
For Becca.

1327
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,780
为了贝卡
For Becca.

1328
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,400
为了贝卡
For Becca.

1329
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:52,050
如果你再干坏事
You fuck up once,

1330
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,360
你再想要伤害任何人
you even think of hurting anyone ever again,

1331
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:58,610
我们就埋了你
we will bury you.

1332
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,930
你根本预料不到
You'll never see it coming.

1333
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,730
明白了吗
Are we clear?

1334
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,190
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

1335
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,060
谢谢
Thank you.

1336
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,120
我们会盯着你  彼得
We'll be watching, Peter.

1337
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,280
真简单
Well, that was easy.

1338
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,010
他斯德哥尔摩综合征了吗
Stockholm syndrome, anyone?

1339
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,260
他说谢谢
He said thank you.

1340
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:34,030
-真老套  -钉子
- That was clutch. - Stakes.

1341
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:36,810
电击器
Charges?

1342
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,390
绝对在白天就得喝一杯了
Definitely day drinking, right?

1343
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:51,330
上帝啊
Jesus!

1344
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,560
不错的派对小把戏
A hell of a party trick.

1345
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:54,640
的确很不错
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1346
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:56,950
保持手机开机
Keep your phone on.

1347
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,060
他会给你打电话
He'll call you.

1348
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,300
不是马上  但是
Not right away, but...

1349
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,620
-他会打来的  -好的
- he'll call. - Right.

1350
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:03,700
顺便  你做得很好
You nailed that, by the way.

1351
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,610
天啊
Oh my God.

1352
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,470
我真的超级担心他会
I was so nervous that he was gonna

1353
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,800
突然跳出车外  或者把我推出车外
jump out of the car or push me out of the car

1354
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,990
让我们没法演下去
before we got to the spot.

1355
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,500
然后我...我就失控了
Then I just... I lost my shit.

1356
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,270
我  我真的失控了
I mean, I really lost it.

1357
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:17,740
你是完美的压轴
You were the perfect closer.

1358
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,150
我真的很抱歉  卡拉
I'm so sorry, Kara.

1359
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,770
我每天都在想她
I think about her every single day.

1360
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:33,160
我也是
Yeah, me too.

1361
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,860
天啊  真的很对不起
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1362
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,670
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1363
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:23,580
这些床单一股尿味
These sheets smell like piss.

1364
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,420
对我们用的剂量的最终决定呢  女士们
Final verdict on the micro dosing, ladies?

1365
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:44,440
绝对得用曼陀罗
Well, the Datura was definitely the right species.

1366
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:46,330
真是调皮的小东西
It's a nasty little fucker.

1367
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,060
但是我们能再多加点
But we coulda used more.

1368
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,110
都怪我  我的炼金术还需要练习
That's on me. Yeah, I'm just growing into my alchemy.

1369
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,940
这个平衡很微妙  因为我们希望他瘸
It's a delicate balance, 'cause you want him to go limp

1370
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,270
出现幻觉  但不能死
and see shit but not die, right?

1371
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:56,470
我只是想说
Well, I just wanna say

1372
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,560
谢谢是肯定的
thank you, obviously.

1373
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,590
卡拉刚给我打电话时  我承认我有所怀疑
When Kara first called me, I admit I was skeptical.

1374
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:07,580
但是听起来你们真的改变了他
But it sounds like you really reached him.

1375
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:13,000
或者他只是怕了  以为我们给他的屌下了巫毒术
Or he's just scared and thinks we put voodoo on his dick.

1376
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,290
也许吧
Maybe.

1377
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:16,530
但也许不是
But maybe not.

1378
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:20,930
对我来说有区别
Well, it makes a difference to me.

1379
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:22,090
他是我全部的家人了
He's my whole family.

1380
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,240
你们不像我这么了解他
You don't know him like I do.

1381
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,930
我们齐集一堂都有各自的理由  对吗
Well, we all have reasons for being here, right?

1382
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,280
我的婚礼还有三小时就开始了  彼得
My wedding is in three hours, Peter.

1383
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,990
你怎么有脸来
How can you possibly justify coming here?

1384
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,600
就一分钟
For one minute.

1385
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,290
我想见见我们的女儿  拜托你
I need to see our daughter, please.

1386
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,290
一分钟
One minute,

1387
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,070
就行了
and that's it.

1388
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:49,610
-就行了  -天啊  你看上去一团糟
- Okay. - Jesus, you look like shit.

1389
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,230
爸爸  你干什么
Dad, what are you doing?

1390
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,120
-你没事吧  -没事...
- You okay? - Yeah, um...

1391
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,430
我们能去散散步吗
could we go for a walk?

1392
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,130
-嗯  -谢谢你
- Yeah. - Thank you.

1393
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,100
敬放干了沼泽
To draining the swamp,

1394
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,110
一次一个坏男人
one bad hombre at a time.

1395
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:19,940
我觉得我们都可以好好干一杯
I think we can all drink to that.

1396
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,320
这些小泡泡
Little stingy on the bubbly,

1397
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,060
我能连喝三杯
I'm gonna need three of these.

1398
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,240
太棒了
Amazing!

1399
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:39,600
我一直将你的可贵之处当做理所当然的馈赠
I've taken for granted how precious you are and...

1400
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,290
你每次也都原谅了我
and you let me get away with it every time,

1401
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:44,450
但我不希望你再那样做了
but I don't want you to do that anymore.

1402
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,660
不能为我  也不能为任何人这样
Not for me, not for any man.

1403
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:53,190
我们再也不说谎了  宝贝
No more lies, baby, okay?

1404
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:55,810
我不会再错过任何事
And I'm never gonna miss a thing.

1405
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,120
我会参加你的每一场足球比赛
And I'll be at every soccer game from here on out,

1406
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,050
我会跟其他父母一样背着
and I'm gonna be carrying one of those big plastic bags

1407

of orange slices like those other parents do, okay?

1408
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,000
天啊  爸爸
Oh my God, Dad.

Are you dying?

我觉得我也许该死
I think maybe I should have.

1412

但我还在这里
But I'm still here,

1413
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,650
所以我是全世界
which makes me the luckiest man

1414
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:22,700
最幸运的人
on the planet.

Not next weekend, tomorrow, okay?

1419
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:50,510
怎么回事
What is this?

1420
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,290
你要死了还是怎么着吗
What, are you dying or something?

1421
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:57,780
劳拉  我很抱歉  我在各个方面
Laura, I'm so sorry I failed you

1422
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,230
都辜负了你
on every conceivable level.

1423
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,650
不仅仅是我
It wasn't just me.

1424
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:34,920
彼得
Hey, Peter.

Hi-- hi, hello.

We do now.
