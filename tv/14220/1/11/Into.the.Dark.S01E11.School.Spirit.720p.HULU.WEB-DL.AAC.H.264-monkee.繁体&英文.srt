{\an8}深入黑暗  第一季 第十一集

18
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,820
{\an8}開學前一天

19
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,620
真不敢相信我要這么做
I can't believe I'm doing this.

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,040
誰畢業了還闖回學校里去
Who graduates and then breaks back into the school?

21
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,140
你最好別臨陣脫逃
You better not be backing out.

22
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,560
我在這監獄里還要蹲一年呢
I still have one more year left in this prison.

23
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,250
給我點光
Give me a light.

24
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,950
哥們  他們可能換了鎖了
Dude, they might have changed the locks, man.

25
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,850
我們做的事真的違法嗎
Is what we're doing actually illegal?

26
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,540
我不知道  反正肯定不好
I don't know, I mean, it's definitely not good.

27
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,730
要我老實說的話
I kind of think you're a fucking creep

28
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,900
我覺得你挺恐怖的
if you want me to be honest.

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,390
我們去拿梯子吧
Let's just get the ladder.

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,730
上將隊  真俗氣
The Admirals. How corny.

31
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,400
{\an8}赫布魯克

32
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,790
我們怎么不叫老虎隊  毒蛇隊
We could have been the tigers or the vipers.

33
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,850
你確定沒有校園保安嗎
Are you sure there's no one campus security?

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,610
確定  哥們
Yeah, dude, I'm sure.

35
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,220
這破地方連廁紙都買不起
This place can't even afford toilet paper.

36
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,020
{\an8}女生更衣室

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,010
好吧
All right.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,180
就在上面
Right up there.

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,780
好
All right.

40
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,450
如果你需要的話  我有螺絲刀
I got a screwdriver if you need it.

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
我在這里時
You know, I always thought

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,270
總覺得有什么在監視我們
something was watching us when I was here.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,320
好吧
All right.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,900
手機上能看到了嗎
You see it on your phone?

45
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,340
我去  成功了
Holy shit, it works.

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,100
哥們  這絕對是違法的
Dude, this is definitely illegal.

47
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,850
我可不會像個變態似的
I'm not gonna be a pervert about it.

48
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,030
反正這里的女生都很丑
The girls are ugly here anyway.

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,530
我只會在返校前進行直播
I'm just gonna livestream it before homecoming,

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,560
讓大家慌張
everyone's gonna freak out,

51
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,370
這樣一整個學年都會很好玩
and the whole school year's gonna be fun.

52
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,200
好吧  我來安完
All right, I'll secure it.

53
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,610
"我可不會像個變態似的"
"I'm not gonna be a pervert about it."

54
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,190
你什么毛病
What's wrong with you?

55
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,050
瘋子
Crazy.

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,780
陶德
Todd.

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,880
陶德
Todd?

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,370
陶德
Todd?

59
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,470
陶德
Todd!

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,160
陶德  這可不好玩  別鬧了
Todd, this isn't funny. Quit it.

61
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,980
搞什么
What the fuck?

62
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,000
該死
Oh, shit!

63
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,850
{\an8}校鬼

64
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,480
早上好  赫布魯克高中
Good morning, Helbrook High.

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,600
各位上將們  歡迎回到學校
Fellow Admirals, welcome back to school.

66
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,440
我是艾瑞卡·楊  高四班長
I'm Erica Yang, your Senior Class President.

67
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,330
我想首先向各位高四生
I'd like to start with a special message

68
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,810
傳達一條特別信息
for my fellow seniors.

69
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,370
各位  這是我們最后同校的一年了
Guys, this will be our final year together.

70
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,040
誰知道之后我們會有怎樣的際遇
After this, who knows what will happen?

71
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,000
我們可能再也見不到彼此了
We may never see each other again.

72
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,370
有時我會想  時間都去哪了啊
Sometimes I think, whoa, where did these years go?

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,780
我一直在學習
All I did was study...

74
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,510
所以我們盡量抓住這最后一年吧
So let's make the best of our last year.

75
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,910
去冒險  去認識那個
Take a risk, get to know that person

76
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,270
你一直好奇的人
you've always been curious about

77
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,370
趁還來得及去實現你的大計劃
and follow through on your big plans before it's too late.

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,590
但此外  提前大學申請
But also, early college applications

79
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,800
11月結束
are due in November.

80
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,130
我們做個強勢收尾吧
Let's finish strong.

81
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,420
加油上將們
Go Admirals!

82
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,180
{\an8}星期六

83
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,080
{\an8}一周后

84
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,730
該死
Fuck.

85
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
該死
Shit.

86
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,950
艾瑞卡
Erica!

87
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,890
艾瑞卡
Erica.

88
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,640
-杰森  -上不夠學啊
- Jason. - Just can't get enough of school, huh?

89
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,580
還是在跟蹤我
Or are you stalking me?

90
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,970
你居然這么說  明明是你來找我的
Funny you should say that 'cause I think you came to me.

91
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,570
你態度怎么這樣
Hey, what's with the attitude?

92
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,850
是你跟我分手的  記得嗎
You broke up with me, remember?

93
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,020
是啊  但你高二時跟我分手的
Yeah, well, you broke up with me sophomore year,

94
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,290
所以我大概是記仇
so, I guess I hold a grudge.

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,690
我知道你今年結束后
Look, I know after this year

96
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,000
大概會去哈佛大學
you're probably going off to Harvard

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,250
我就再也見不到你了
and I'll never see you again,

98
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,250
但我們現在能好好的嗎
but for now can we just be nice?

99
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,950
如果我當初很混蛋那抱歉了
I'm sorry if I was a jerk.

100
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,300
好吧
Okay.

101
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,390
好嗎
Okay?

102
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,660
你可以不再躲我了嗎
So you can stop ghosting me?

103
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,520
好啊  但你要害我遲到了
Sure, but you're gonna make me late.

104
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,280
遲什么到  你還有周末留堂嗎
Late for what? You got weekend detention or something?

105
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,210
不會吧
No fuckin' way.

106
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,530
真的假的
Seriously?

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,280
艾瑞卡·楊會是做了什么呢
What could Erica Yang have possibly done?

108
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,250
別告訴別人  好嗎
Hey, don't tell anyone, okay?

109
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,380
這事可能要瘋傳的
This may go viral.

110
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,580
我說真的
I'm serious.

111
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,450
你不能告訴任何人我今天留堂了
You can't tell anyone I had detention today.

112
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,230
走著瞧吧
We'll see.

113
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,140
或許等會兒我們去約會時你可以告訴我你做了什么
Maybe you can tell me what you did on our date later.

114
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,620
隨便吧
Whatever.

115
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,930
我死了
I died.

116
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,570
我知道
I know.

117
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,790
大概得在場才會覺得好笑
I guess you had to be there.

118
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,380
我更快  更強
I'm faster, I'm stronger.

119
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,470
我體力上并不更強
I mean, I'm not physically stronger,

120
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,340
但我...
but like I'm like, um...

121
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,830
看那是誰
Look who it is.

122
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,590
那不是學校的完美公主小姐嗎
Isn't that the Princess Miss Perfect of the school?

123
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,330
她要跟我們一起留堂
Is she having detention with us?

124
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,150
你不能坐那里
Hey, you can't sit there.

125
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,570
那是我的座位
It's my seat.

126
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,160
那是她的
That one's hers.

127
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,200
你迷路了嗎
Are you lost?

128
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,350
你知道這是留堂吧
You know this is detention, right?

129
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,250
我知道
I'm aware.

130
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,420
你幾乎什么都說錯了
You're wrong about like almost everything.

131
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,770
看看誰回來了
Hey, look who's back.

132
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,590
你們好啊
Hi, guys.

133
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,920
學年第一個周末
First weekend of the school year?

134
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,300
厲害了
I am impressed.

135
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,820
閉嘴  看前面
Mouths shut, eyes up.

136
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,620
都就坐
Everybody take a seat.

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,530
歡迎來到今年第一次周六留堂
Welcome to the first Saturday detention of the year.

I am your Vice Principal, Mr. Armstrong.

139
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,550

You know the drill.

140
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,750
手機放進桶里
Phones in the bucket.

麗莎·惠特莫爾

143
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,190
早  阿姆斯特朗老師
Morning, Mr. Armstrong.

144
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,800
伊麗莎白  你還是屢教不改
Elizabeth, I see you're still incorrigible.

145
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,780
什么
Incorrial what?

146
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,990
拉塞爾·瓊斯  阿姆斯特朗老師  你好嗎
Russel Jones, Mr. Armstrong, how are you?

147
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,880
夠了
That's enough.

148
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,510
名字就行
The name will do.

149
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,440
你已經知道我的名字了  寫下來就行
You already know my name, just write it down.

150
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,850
你這就要找我麻煩嗎
Are you messing with me already,

151
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,900
你個小混蛋
you little prick?

152
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,010
我覺得你是不能那么喊我的
I don't think you're allowed to call me that.

153
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,040
這有違規定
It's against the rules.

154
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,850
留堂的孩子還教訓我規矩的事
I got kids in detention telling me about the rules.

155
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,210
我跟你說清楚  維克多
I'm gonna make something really clear for you, Victor.

156
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,050
才沒人在乎你呢
Nobody gives a flying monkey turd about you.

157
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,910
我對你這種差生想說什么做什么都行
I say and do whatever I want to delinquents like you.

158
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,550
所以  報上姓名
So, say your name.

159
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,050
維克多·卡斯特羅
Victor Castro.

160
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,890
看
See?

161
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,510
沒那么難吧
That wasn't so hard.

162
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,110
布雷特·卡勒維
Brett Callaway.

163
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,550
我沒帶我的手機  老師
Oh, I don't have mine, sir.

164
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,250
你在騙我嗎
Are you messing with me?

165
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,460
你們這些孩子
You kids can't go two minutes

166
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,100
兩分鐘不看手機都做不到
without looking at one of these things.

167
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,420
這是種病
It's a disease.

168
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,030
我記得不讓帶手機
I remembered that phones aren't allowed

169
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,710
我就沒帶來  真的
so I didn't bring mine, honest.

170
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,600
如果我發現你在撒謊
If I find out you're lying to me,

171
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,050
我就停你的學  明白嗎
I'm gonna suspend you, you understand?

172
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,880
是  老師
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,170
你是個好孩子
You're a nice kid.

174
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,220
我不希望你再回來
I don't want to see you back again

175
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,390
跟這些白癡作伴
with these idiots.

176
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,960
-好吧  -拜托  我干什么了
- Okay. - Come on, what did I do?

177
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,440
最后同等重要的
And last but not least,

178
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,300
我們今天的特別來賓
our very, very special guest for the day,

179
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,530
艾瑞卡·楊小姐
Ms. Erica Yang.

180
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,610
很不幸要參加周末的留堂
Who lucked out with weekend detention

181
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,390
因為她那可恥的罪行
after her shameful, shameful crime.

182
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,100
天哪  她干什么了
Whoa, what did she do?

183
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,830
不關你們的事
Hey, that's nobody else's business.

184
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,850
-好吧  -我不能留著手機嗎
- Okay. - I can't keep my phone?

185
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,360
不  你不能留著手機
No, you can't keep your phone.

186
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,890
你正留堂呢  規矩不同了
You're in detention now, things are different here.

187
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,300
我得說你非常非常幸運
You know, I have to say that you're very, very lucky

188
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,420
摩根校長希望你這樣的年輕姑娘成功
that Principal Morgan wants young ladies like you to succeed

189
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,550
因為要換了我  你就被開除了
because if it were up to me you would have been expelled.

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,630
我會用你殺雞儆猴
I would have made an example out of you.

191
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,620
那是什么
What's this?

192
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,150
我想做些作業
I was going to do some homework.

193
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,010
這不是自習室
This isn't study hall.

194
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,970
他會讓我們寫檢討  反省自己有多糟糕
He's gonna make us write essays about how awful we are.

195
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,970
又錯了  伊麗莎白
Wrong again, Elizabeth,

196
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,450
因為顯然這沒屁用
since clearly it doesn't do shit.

197
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,300
從今天起
As of today,

198
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,890
在我監督留堂時
when you're in my detention...

199
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,530
你們要打掃學校
...you get to clean the school.

200
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,820
非常感謝
Hi, yes, thank you so much.

201
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,660
你不能讓我們干雜活
You can't make us do chores.

202
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,580
我能  是的  我能
Oh, yes, I can, yes, I can.

203
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,750
項目清單第一項
The first order of business

204
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,620
你們要除掉
is that you're going to be removing

205
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,140
這些桌子下面的
all of the gum from the undersides

206
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,600
所有口香糖
of all of these tables.

207
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,820
太惡心了
That's disgusting.

208
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,030
是的  是的  是很惡心
Yes! Yes, it is disgusting.

209
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,830
所以麻煩不要把你們口香糖隨便亂粘
So please don't stick your gum on things.

210
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,280
生命的循環
Circle of life.

211
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,420
還有  如果你們用漂白劑
Also, if you'd like to use this bleach,

212
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,740
你們也可以除掉
you can remove some of the graffiti

213
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,230
桌底下的一些涂鴉
that's under the tables as well.

214
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,690
這是違法的
This is illegal.

215
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,580
我不干
I'm not doing this.

216
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,910
會的  你會的
Oh, yes, you are.

217
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,380
你要欣欣然上來
You're gonna dance on up here,

218
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,430
拿一個工具
you're gonna grab one of those,

219
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,580
然后去干活
and you're gonna get to work.

220
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,460
你能把我怎樣
Make me.

221
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,790
老兄  算了吧
Dude, just let it go.

222
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,010
有人跟你說話了嗎
Was anyone talking to you?

223
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,240
我不知道這有什么誤會
I don't know what the confusion here is.

224
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,110
這里我負責  我下命令  你們都聽我的
I'm in charge and when I give you an order, you listen.

225
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,760
就像你求你妻子
Like how your wife listened

226
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,650
別離開時她聽你的嗎
when you begged her not to leave you?

227
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,960
不好意思  你的前妻
I'm sorry, your ex-wife.

228
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,120
大伙兒  別動手
You guys, please.

229
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,920
是啊  是啊  沒事
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

230
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,090
沒關系  你說得對
That's fine, yeah, you're right.

231
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,590
你說得對  你說得對
You're right, you're right.

232
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,760
我是副校長  我不該碰你
I'm the Vice Principal, I shouldn't be touching you.

233
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,890
我就再給你四個周六
I'll just give you four more Saturdays.

234
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,790
-干什么  -什么
- For what? - What's that?

235
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,870
什么  你想要八個
What's that? You want eight?

236
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,830
因為  因為就那么簡單
Because-because it's just that easy.

237
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,050
我只需要寫出來
All I have to do is write it out

238
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,730
讓你承受后果
and then you suffer the consequences.

239
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,540
如果你想做個混蛋
If you want to be a fuckup...

240
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,140
那我成全你
...I'm here to support you.

241
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,700
很好
Good.

242
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,400
大伙兒都干活
Everybody get to work.

243
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,430
我現在沒心情
Not in the mood.

244
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,530
好了
All right, uh,

245
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,310
我要去辦公室回些郵件
I'm gonna go to my office and work on some emails.

246
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,750
有誰敢離開這里  就被停學
Anybody who leaves this room is suspended.

247
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,230
因為那兩個失蹤的孩子  我們還在封鎖中
We're still on lockdown because of those two missing kids,

248
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,640
所以我很不幸要對你們的安全負責
so unfortunately for me I am responsible for you,

249
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,110
但我想這不意味著
but I trust that that doesn't mean

250
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,500
我要每時每刻盯著你們
that I have to babysit you the entire time.

251
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,900
對嗎
Right?

252
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,790
對  阿姆斯特朗老師
Yes, Mr. Armstrong.

253
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,960
老天  我以為他永遠不走呢
God, I thought he'd never leave.

254
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,830
今天他比平時待得更久
Took longer than he usually does.

255
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,050
真不敢相信陶德還失蹤著
I can't believe Todd is still missing.

256
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,350
我信  那家伙是個白癡
I can, that guy's an idiot.

257
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,570
他不在感覺怪怪的
Feels weird without him.

258
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,130
有多久了
How long has it been?

259
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,140
年初開始吧  我想
Since the beginning of the year, I think.

260
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,850
也許他被那個鬼抓了
Maybe the ghost got him.

261
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,050
我的天  別再說這個了
Oh, my god, please do not start with that.

262
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,670
我一直告訴別人
I keep trying to tell people.

263
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,580
赫布魯克鬧鬼
Helbrook is haunted.

264
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,580
你不會真相信吧
You don't actually believe that, do you?

265
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,940
信啊  如果我信呢
Yeah, what if I did?

266
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,720
你告訴我
You tell me.

267
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,300
為什么學校每年都有學生失蹤
Why do students go missing every year?

268
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,430
校鬼把他們抓走了
The School Spirit comes and takes them away.

269
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,410
你聽說過  對吧
You heard about that, right?

270
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,900
我聽過傳說
I mean, yeah, I've heard stories,

271
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,530
但我一直以為是個玩笑
but I always just assumed it was a joke.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,560
如果真有人失蹤就不算是玩笑了
It's not a joke if people are actually disappearing.

273
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,400
反正你不用擔心
Well, you don't have to worry.

274
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,240
為什么
Why is that?

275
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,770
傳說不是說那鬼只抓壞孩子嗎
I mean, isn't the legend like the ghost only takes bad kids?

276
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,710
那我們都死定了
Well, then we're all dead.

277
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,830
你什么意思  壞孩子
What did you mean, uh, bad kids though?

278
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,460
多壞算壞
Like how bad?

279
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,330
我聽說是個穿上將衣服的老女人
I heard it's an old lady in an Admiral costume,

280
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,140
她只抓男孩  好強奸他們
and she only takes boys so she can rape them.

281
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,420
這太蠢了
That is so stupid.

282
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,860
什么意思  強壯  性欲旺盛的
What do you mean, like, a strong old woman

283
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,150
老女人嗎
who's really horny?

284
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,120
就像是個死了的僵尸女士
It's like a dead zombie lady.

285
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,580
她是十多年前學校的一位緊張兮兮的老師
Apparently, she was some uptight teacher from like 10 years ago.

286
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,880
學生們對她使了個惡作劇
The kids pulled a prank on her.

287
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,550
他們倒了一盆涼水在她身上
They dumped a bunch of cold water on her.

288
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,350
具體怎么回事也不清楚
Nobody knows exactly.

289
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,700
但她突發心臟病  當場就死了
But she had a heart attack and died right there on the spot.

290
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,700
那些學生怕極了  于是用
The kids freaked out, so they covered her up

291
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,410
上將的吉祥物服裝將她掩蓋
by putting her in an Admiral mascot costume

292
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,080
然后把尸體藏在了學校里
and hid her body on campus.

293
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,650
從那以后  她就一直在學校陰魂不散
And since then, she's been haunting the school

294
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,410
向壞孩子報仇
and taking revenge on bad kids.

295
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,180
說到壞
Speaking of bad,

296
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,000
剛才他說的"你沒被開除已經很走運了"是怎么回事
what was all that "You're lucky to not be expelled" talk?

297
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,980
你干什么了
What'd you do?

298
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,970
我不太想說
I really prefer not to talk about it.

299
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,760
你擔心我們會評頭論足嗎
Are you worried we're gonna judge you?

300
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,810
你不說我們會越加評頭論足
We'll judge you more for not telling.

301
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,200
我覺得大家都有點感興趣
I think we're all a little intrigued.

302
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,320
我打賭她什么也沒做
I bet she didn't do anything.

303
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,470
是嗎
Yeah, right?

304
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,770
她也許是被派來打我們幾個小報告的
She's probably here to write some report on us fuckups.

305
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,090
你就扯吧  好嗎
Speak for yourself, okay?

306
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,670
我打算拿到A和B呢
I plan to get all As and Bs.

307
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,220
是真的嗎  你是來作業做研究的
Is that true? Are you just here doing research?

308
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,740
你們為什么都這么好奇
Why are you all so curious?

309
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,730
你做了什么讓你留堂
What did you do to get detention?

310
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,070
該問我沒做什么
What didn't I do?

311
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,230
喝酒  抽煙
Drinking, smoking.

312
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,570
違抗命令
Insubordination.

313
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,120
你聽上去很自豪
You sound like you're proud.

314
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,020
我只是好好享受生活
I'm just living my best life.

315
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,570
我們不是所有人都想上哈佛
Not all of us want to go to Harvard.

316
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,050
她故意留堂  這樣就不用回家
She gets detention on purpose so she doesn't have to go home

317
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,560
面對她那酒鬼媽媽了
and be with her alcoholic mom.

318
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,550
-去你的  -得了吧
- Screw you. - Oh, please.

319
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,260
不如我們回去干活吧
Why don't we just get back to work?

320
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,000
阿姆斯特朗老師隨時可能回來
Mr. Armstrong might come back any minute.

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,340
親愛的  不會的
Oh, sweetie, no.

322
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,680
他要離開好一會
He'll be gone for a while.

323
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,930
你們怎么知道
How do you know that?

324
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,140
是真的
No, it's true.

325
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,420
他正在自己辦公室喝酒呢
He's in his office right now getting drunk.

326
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,270
-連他都知道  -什么
- Even he knows. - What?

327
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,950
阿姆斯特朗是酒鬼
Armstrong's an alcoholic.

328
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,340
我就不能離開它們
I just can't get away from them.

329
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,920
說到這個
Speaking of which,

330
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,680
拉斯  你能再給我們來點那酒嗎
hey, Russ, can you get us that booze again?

331
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,900
-我該嗎  -當然
- Should I? - Yeah.

332
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,360
可以調節下這兒的氣氛
The vibe in here could use a little help.

333
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,680
你的儲物柜還有大麻嗎
still got that weed in your locker?

334
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,860
一直有
Always.

335
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,610
大伙  阿姆斯特朗老師今天看起來情緒不好
You guys, Mr. Armstrong seems pretty tense today.

336
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,110
也許我們該悠著點
Maybe we should just take it easy.

337
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,750
老兄  拜托  你總是掃興
Dude, come on, you're always such a buzzkill.

338
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,770
艾瑞卡
Erica...

339
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,750
你現在是我們中的一員了
You're one of us now.

340
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,500
你馬上就要開始了
You're about to get initiated.

341
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,080
沒錯
Fuck yeah.

342
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,200
我們先讓她嗨起來
We'll get her lit.

343
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,160
然后她就會告訴我們為什么來這了
Then she can tell us why she's here.

344
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,750
這些人太魯莽了
Those guys are so reckless.

345
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,610
你來這里后他們更猖狂了
They're even worse when you're here.

346
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,880
我理解
I get it.

347
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,620
大家都認為我是最棒的學生
Everyone thinks I'm this perfect student.

348
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,590
你就是啊
Well, you are.

349
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,000
其實我很驚訝我竟然
I'm actually really amazed that I'm speaking

350
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,850
現在正在和艾瑞卡·楊聊天
with the Erica Yang right now.

351
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,960
拜托
Please.

352
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,760
兩次獲得"年度最佳學生"
Yeah, two Time Admiral of the Year.

353
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,970
平均分最高  資深班長
Highest GPA, senior class president.

354
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,110
你是赫布魯克的黃金標準
You're the gold standard at Helbrook.

355
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,460
我并不知道這些
I don't know about that.

356
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,910
你的演講棒極了
And your speech was incredible.

357
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,790
我的演講
My speech?

358
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,630
是的  就在年初的時候
Yeah, at the beginning of the year.

359
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,340
非常振奮人心  我一直記在心上
It was inspiring, I really took it to heart.

360
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,970
你曾說  這是最后一年了  要勇于冒險
You know, about it being the last year and taking risks

361
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,300
不要留下遺憾
and not having regrets.

362
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,760
這也正是我來這里的原因
It's actually the reason why I'm here right now.

363
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,490
不  你干了什么
Oh, no, what'd you do?

364
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,210
其實無所謂
Actually, never mind.

365
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,630
我問你的語氣就像他們問我一樣
Now I'm doing to you what they were doing to me.

366
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,990
我很驚訝能在這里看到你
I was really surprised to see you here.

367
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,120
阿姆斯特朗老師說你差點被開除
Mr. Armstrong said that you almost got expelled.

368
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,270
這看起來是不可能的事
It just seems impossible.

369
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,760
他是認真的還是...
Was he being serious or was it...?

370
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,430
該死...
Oh, mother...?

371
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,870
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

372
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,430
老天  今天遭透了
Man, this day sucks.

373
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,770
或許我們應該和他們一起喝醉
Maybe we should just get drunk with them.

374
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,180
我去給你拿急救箱
I'll go get you a first aid kit.

375
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,110
我覺得木工房里有一個
I think there's one in woodshop.

376
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,950
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

377
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,480
你一個人在這沒事吧
Are you gonna be okay in here by yourself?

378
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,810
當然沒事
Yeah, of course.

379
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,610
好的
Okay.

380
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,210
鱷梨煙斗還是電子煙
Okay, so, avocado pipe or vape?

381
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,560
無所謂  我只想再來杯蘇格蘭酒
I don't care, I just want that scotch again.

382
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,420
還是叫威士忌  等等  這倆有什么區別
Or is it whiskey? Wait, what's the difference?

383
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,720
都是酒鬼們的最愛
All alcoholics.

384
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,710
校訓在我們頭上[校鬼在看著我們]
Hm, the School Spirit is upon us.

385
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,100
-我討厭你  -你們倆去拿酒
- I hate you. - You guys get the booze

386
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,040
我們一會在這里集合
and we'll meet back here?

387
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,350
等等  你要去哪里
Wait, where are you going?

388
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,230
你別擔心了
Don't worry about it.

389
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,520
怎么  你是無敵的
What, so you're invincible?

390
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,850
不會陷入麻煩嗎
You just can't get in trouble?

391
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,270
我要去拉屎
I need to take a shit.

392
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,370
這我就無話可說了
Can't argue with that.

393
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,210
-和以前一樣嗎  -是的  我來檢查一下
- Same as before? - Yeah, let me check.

394
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,060
好的
Okay.

395
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
好  別拿那些好的
Okay, don't get the good stuff.

396
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,250
他會注意到的  和我媽一樣
He'll notice that, it's the same as my mom.

397
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,790
她經常喝的酒不見的話
Like when the stuff she gets all the time is gone,

398
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,980
她只是認為她給喝了
she just assumes that she drank it.

399
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,960
好的
Oh... okay.

400
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,330
{\an8}阿姆斯特朗老師

401
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,200
{\an8}貝弗莉·阿姆斯特朗

402
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,300
{\an8}阿姆斯特朗老師

403
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,600
我的天...
Oh, my go...

404
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,210
拉斯
Russ?

405
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,130
小維
Vic?

406
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,740
我只能找到一些邦迪創可貼
Hey, I can only find a few BandAids.

407
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,230
我覺得已經止住了
I think it coagulated.

408
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,000
我能看一眼嗎
Oh, can I take a look?

409
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,550
當然
Sure.

410
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,600
你們為什么拉著手
Were you guys holding hands?

411
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,920
你不是在和籃球隊的那個人談戀愛嗎
Aren't you with that guy from the basketball team?

412
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,750
不  其實我們分手了
No, actually we broke up.

413
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,280
我知道了
Oh, I see.

414
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,400
你們為什么不明白
Oh, what don't you guys understand

415
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,880
我們是在你的儲物柜前集合
about meet back at your locker?

416
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,980
我像個傻子一樣在那里等著
I was waiting there like a dumbass.

417
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,040
拉斯呢
Where's Russ?

418
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,940
我不知道
I don't know.

419
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,340
我沒看見他
I didn't see him.

420
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,910
沒有  他沒回到過這里
Yeah, no, he didn't come back here.

421
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,350
糟了
Shit.

422
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,740
你們覺得他不會被抓吧
You don't think he got caught, do you?

423
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,750
不會  如果他被抓了
No, Armstrong would be in here

424
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,460
阿姆斯特朗會回到這里  像個瘋子一樣大喊
screaming like a maniac if he did.

425
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,950
所以你想抽電子煙
So, uh, do you want to hit the vape

426
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,140
還是你也決定變成一個酒鬼
or are you determined to become an alcoholic too?

427
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,460
如果我不喝酒  你會更開心嗎
Would it make you happier if I didn't drink?

428
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,570
會的
Yes.

429
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,570
那我們抽電子煙吧
Then let's just hit the vape.

430
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,820
好
All right.

431
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,450
你們一起來嗎
Are you two down?

432
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,220
我不覺得這是個好主意
I don't think this is a good idea.

433
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,480
我的天  你覺得任何事都是個壞主意
Oh, my god, you think everything is a bad idea.

434
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,170
如果阿姆斯特朗老師突然出現呢
Yeah, what if Mr. Armstrong surprises us?

435
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,800
他不會的  他根本不在乎我們
He won't, he doesn't care enough to.

436
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,180
等等  等一下
Wait, hold up.

437
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,530
你們兩個要去告密嗎
Are you two going to snitch?

438
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,140
不  我不告密
No, I don't snitch.

439
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,710
我不會說的
I won't tell.

440
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,880
我不知道是否該相信他們
I don't know if I trust 'em.

441
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,300
你們中的一個人要和我們一起抽
One of you needs to do this with us,

442
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,070
這樣我們才能知道你們不是"緝毒警"
so we know you guys aren't narcs.

443
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,760
我不能抽煙  真的
I can't use that stuff, really.

444
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,150
那只能是你了
Well, then it's gotta be you.

445
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,140
你以前磕嗨過嗎
Have you been high before?

446
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,580
她當然沒有過
Of course she hasn't.

447
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,050
-你可不知道  -好
- You don't know that. - All right,

448
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,000
那你就抽一個
well then hit it.

449
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,690
證明一下你不是警察
Prove that you're not a cop.

450
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,930
如果你們想抽  我們不會打小報告
If you want to do it, we won't tell,

451
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,350
但別強迫艾瑞卡抽
but just don't make Erica do it.

452
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,640
沒人強迫我做任何事
No one makes me do anything.

453
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,300
真棒  女性的力量  我喜歡
Fuck yeah, woman power, I like that.

454
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,570
讓我看看
Let me see it.

455
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,870
-我應該怎么做  -你只需要
- What do I do? - You just hold down

456
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,310
按著這個按鈕  然后吸氣
that button and inhale.

457
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,160
等等  我們來做個交易
Wait, let's make a deal.

458
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,630
如果我抽了  證明我不是"緝毒警"之類的
If I do this and prove that I'm not a narc or whatever,

459
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,800
你們就絕對不能告訴別人
then you guys absolutely can't tell anyone

460
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,410
我今天來過這里
that I was here today at all.

461
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,480
-好  -沒問題
- Yeah. - That's fine.

462
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,340
留堂期間發生的事就封存在這間圖書館里
What happens in detention stays in detention.

463
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,390
-保證  -我保證
- Promise. - I promise.

464
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,550
老天啊  我們要和艾瑞卡·楊一起嗑藥了
Holy shit, we're about to get high with Erica Yang.

465
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,770
太壯觀了
Epic.

466
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,170
他們以為我在社區服務
They think I have community service.

467
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,450
你確實藏了許多秘密
You really do keep a lot of secrets.

468
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,040
所以呢
So what?

469
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,810
你父母不讓你吃晚飯嗎
Your parents wouldn't let you eat dinner?

470
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,290
不讓
Nope.

471
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,850
除非我把所有作業都寫完
Not until I finished all my homework

472
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,690
而且要通過他們編的測試題
and passed their madeup prep quiz.

473
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,940
這太扯了
That's crazy.

474
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,090
我爸只會看體育比賽
All my dad does is watch sports.

475
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,090
我媽只會在他看比賽的時候  給他吃的
And all my mom does is feed him while he's doing it.

476
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,180
至少他們不管你
At least they leave you alone.

477
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,250
沒錯  但他們是失敗者
Yeah, but they're fucking losers.

478
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,590
這不意味著你也要當失敗者
Doesn't mean you have to be one.

479
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,100
你管我叫失敗者嗎
Are you calling me a loser?

480
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,150
什么  沒有
What? No.

481
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,730
我只是說  我們可以走自己的路
No, I was... was just saying we can make our own path.

482
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,810
我們可以選擇當贏家
You know, we can choose to be winners.

483
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,920
謝謝  兄弟
Thanks, buddy.

484
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,360
我已經知道了
I already know.

485
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,890
我上完高中之后
I'm gonna be a firefighter

486
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,790
我想去當一名消防員
when I'm done with this high school nonsense.

487
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,210
你知道嗎
You know what?

488
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,020
你不賴嘛  艾瑞卡·楊
You're not so bad, Erica Yang.

489
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,340
謝謝你
Thank you. I think.

490
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,520
我以為你就是個無聊的人
I thought you were this total square,

491
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,830
但怎么說呢  你自己至少知道這點
but like at least you're aware of it.

492
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,400
這是什么意思
What does that even mean?

493
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,070
意思是這不是她的錯
Like it's not her fault

494
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,900
她身上的壓力太大了
she's got all this pressure on her.

495
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,920
你懂什么壓力
What do you know about pressure?

496
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,940
我當然了解壓力
Hey, I know about pressure.

497
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,780
我們都有各種壓力
We all have pressure to be something.

498
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,980
所以  你到底干了什么  差點被開除
So, what did you do to almost get expelled?

499
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,500
我還是不告訴你們
I'm still not telling you guys.

500
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,210
該死  你在開玩笑嗎
Dammit, are you kidding?

501
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,760
真的不是什么很棒或者很有意思的事
It's really not something cool or interesting.

502
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,250
我也不有趣  也不棒
I'm not interesting or cool.

503
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,610
我周三很無聊  就拉響了防火警報
I got bored on Wednesday, so I pulled the fire alarm.

504
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,570
拉響防火警報很嚴重的
Pulling the fire alarm is kind of a serious thing.

505
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,350
我同意
I agree.

506
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,030
好吧  隨便了
All right, whatever.

507
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,450
我們那天因為這個而取消了一場測試
You know, we had to miss a test that day because of it.

508
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,830
-好吧  -謝謝你
- Okay. - Thank you.

509
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,050
不客氣
You are welcome.

510
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,670
你們應該把門打開
Eh, you guys should open the door.

511
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,350
好吧  我去
All right, I'll do it.

512
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,560
我來吧
I got this.

513
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,260
我們相信你
We believe in you.

514
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,340
你抽過大麻嗎
Have you ever smoked weed?

515
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,640
沒有
No.

516
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,130
-沒有  -你現在可能算接觸性吸毒了
- No. - You could be a little contact high right now.

517
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,940
-你得開心點  -我們得腐化他
- You need to lighten up. - We should corrupt him.

518
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,370
我覺得你們應該不要再對我指手畫腳
I think you should stop telling me what to do.

519
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,570
就是放松一下
It just takes the edge off, you know?

520
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,310
你們覺得你們的朋友去哪里了
Where do you think your friend went?

521
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,780
對了  拉斯
Oh yeah, Russ, uh...

522
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,170
我不知道
I don't know.

523
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,480
那笨蛋可能跑了
That dumbass probably ditched.

524
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,310
所以他才會被留堂
It's why he's in detention in the first place.

525
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,660
你沒事吧
Hey, are you okay?

526
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,410
你看上去  你看上去很擔心
You look...You look worried.

527
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,420
不  我只是
No, I'm just...

528
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,250
勁過了
Faded.

529
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,650
我只是在想校鬼的事
I was just thinking about the School Spirit.

530
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,610
天啊  哥們  看把孩子嚇成什么樣了
Oh, Jesus, come on, dude, look what you've done to her.

531
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,800
-等等  -好吧
- Wait, shh! - Okay.

532
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,580
你們聽到了嗎
Do you hear that?

533
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,410
她完全飄了
Dude, she's tripping.

534
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,990
好吧  現在你們真的嚇到我了
Okay, come on, now you guys are gonna freak me out.

535
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,550
-阿姆斯特朗  -該死
- Armstrong! - Fuck!

536
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,110
-你們能聞出來嗎  -我分辨不出來
- Can you smell it? - I can't tell.

537
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,920
真不知道你們為什么每次都選味道沖的
I don't know why you guys always get the scented ones.

538
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,740
這絕對能聞出來
You can definitely smell it.

539
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,800
該死
Oh, shoot.

540
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,790
怎么回事
What is going on here?

541
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,910
這門為什么開著
Why is this door open?

542
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,730
我們正打算用漂白劑清理桌子
We were just about to clean the desks with bleach

543
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,200
結果被我不小心弄掉在地上了
and then I accidentally dropped it.

544
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,780
別別別用手來收拾
Now, don't...don't...don't clean it with your hands,

545
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,210
這東西有毒
this stuff is toxic.

546
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,380
你們得拿個拖把和...
Now you need to get a mop and a...

547
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,060
和一個桶
and a bucket.

548
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,250
拖把和桶在哪里
Uh, where is the mop and the bucket?

549
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,720
是不是在門衛室
Is it in the janitor's closet?

550
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,210
等一下  等一下  不要動
Wait, wait, freeze, freeze.

551
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,670
你們在這里抽大麻嗎
Are you guys smoking in here?

552
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,590
你這是想要掩蓋嗎
Is this you trying to cover this up?

553
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,710
對不起
I'm sorry.

554
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,860
我只是覺得
It's just so funny,

555
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,700
我們會在留堂期間
the idea that we'd be smoking

556
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,370
抽大麻的想法太好笑了
while we're in detention?

557
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,050
你
You.

558
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,670
他們在抽大麻嗎
Are they smoking?

559
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,430
我覺得你聞到的是漂白劑的味道  先生
I think what you're smelling is the bleach, sir.

560
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,090
不然就是酒味
That or alcohol.

561
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,550
我覺得我好像聞到了酒味
I feel like I smell alcohol,

562
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,270
但我們都沒有喝酒
but we haven't been drinking.

563
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,310
你說什么
What did you say?

564
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,320
我不知道  我聞到了
I don't know, I smell it.

565
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,100
好吧
All right.

566
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,740
你們去門衛室拿桶來
You get the bucket from the janitor's closet

567
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,690
-把這里清理干凈  -好的  阿姆斯特朗老師
- and clean this up. - Yes, Mr. Armstrong.

568
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,530
等一下
Wait a minute.

569
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,250
-拉塞爾在哪里  -你沒有見到他嗎
- Where's Russel? - You haven't seen him?

570
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,850
我為什么會見到他
Why would I have seen him?

571
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,240
-他跑哪里去了  -我覺得
- Where the hell is he? - I mean, I...

572
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,220
我覺得可以說他跑了
I think it's safe to say he ditched.

573
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,070
什么
What?

574
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,440
我說了學校封鎖了
I told you guys we're on lockdown.

575
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,040
我根本無法信任你們這些廢物
I'm just gonna have to literally lock the building doors

576
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,190
能干好一件事  所以我必須
since I can't trust any of you twerps

577
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,590
真的把每扇門都給鎖上
to do a single goddamn thing.

578
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,650
該死
Fuck!

579
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,980
趕緊收拾干凈
Clean this up.

580
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,670
真是太厲害了
That was awesome.

581
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,230
-謝了  -天啊
- Thanks. - Oh, my god.

582
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,140
哥們  真不敢相信你真的那么說了
Dude, I cannot believe you said that.

583
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,100
你看到他臉上的表情了嗎
Did you see the look on his face?

584
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,570
他完全慫了
He totally backed down.

585
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,520
當然了
Of course he did.

586
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,790
好了  哥們  你不是警察了
All right, dude, you're not a cop.

587
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,130
謝謝你  真的
Thank you. Really.

588
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,290
不然我肯定會有大麻煩的
I would have been in so much trouble.

589
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
看吧  我就說我不會告密的
See, I told you guys I wasn't a snitch,

590
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,340
但是剛剛真的差點就被識破了
but did you see how close that was?

591
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,440
走吧  我們去拿拖把
Come on, let's go get the mop.

592
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,420
好吧
Okay.

593
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,610
好吧
Ooh, okay.

594
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,570
你們倆在學校里不許愛愛哦
Hey, you two, no sex on campus.

595
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,260
校鬼會來抓你們的
The School Spirit will come and get you.

596
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,000
成熟點
Grow up.

597
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,840
{\an8}高四規矩

598
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,650
我覺得我好像在慢慢地回流
I feel like I'm slowly doing a backflip.

599
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,210
真不敢相信我嗑嗨了
I can't believe I'm stoned.

600
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,300
布雷特  我們不能告訴任何人
Brett, we can't tell anybody about this.

601
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,650
我不會的
I won't.

602
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,900
但你不要再讓那些人
You really have to stop letting those guys

603
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,670
逼你做那些不是你會做的事
pressure you into doing things that aren't you.

604
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,540
他們也沒有那么壞
They're not so bad.

605
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,800
他們不是好學生
I mean, they're not great students,

606
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,870
但他們也不是壞人
but they're not bad people.

607
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,510
嗯
Yeah.

608
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,440
我們是不是一起上過課
Have we had a class together?

609
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,690
嗯  我們...我們一起上過課
Um, yeah, we've...We had class, um,

610
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,330
但我比較喜歡做人群中的一個路人甲
but I kind of just like to stay in the background.

611
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,470
我明白
I get that.

612
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,010
有時候我也會希望我是個無名小卒
Sometimes I wish I was a nobody.

613
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,130
不要那么說
Don't say that.

614
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,880
很多人都很崇拜你
A lot of people look up to you.

615
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,660
或者說應該崇拜你
Or they should.

616
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,150
也許我們不該嗑嗨
Maybe we shouldn't have gotten high

617
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,200
然后講鬼故事
and told ghost stories.

618
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,480
這世上沒有鬼
There's no such thing as ghosts.

619
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,520
我都分不清是我嗑嗨了還是真的聽到什么了
I can't tell if I'm high or if I'm hearing things.

620
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,220
你肯定會聽到些什么的
You're definitely just hearing things.

621
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,620
這幢樓有年頭了
It's an old building.

622
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,360
天啊
Oh, my god!

623
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,120
杰森  你嚇了我一大跳
Jason, you scared the shit out of me.

624
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,290
太好了  我就想嚇你呢
Great, that was the point.

625
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,910
你好
Sup.

626
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,610
你們在干什么
What are you guys doing?

627
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,960
你不是在留堂嗎
I thought you had detention?

628
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,230
是的
Oh, we do.

629
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,330
我們只是去拿拖把
We were just getting the mop.

630
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,670
你們要打掃什么的嗎
You gotta clean up or something?

631
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,200
差不多吧
Something like that.

632
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,570
你嗑嗨了嗎
Whoa, hey, are you stoned?

633
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,020
沒有  干什么
No, what?

634
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,970
你呢
Are you?

635
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,390
你在這里干什么
What are you doing here?

636
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,160
你是校鬼嗎
Are you the School Spirit?

637
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,090
什么  我剛剛結束籃球訓練
What? I just had basketball practice.

638
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,990
我只是來看看你是不是真的在留堂
I just came by to see if this was for real.

639
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,160
走吧  艾瑞卡  我們得去拿拖把了
Come on, Erica, we should go get the mop.

640
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,500
不  說真的  你嗑嗨了嗎
No, seriously, are you stoned?

641
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,360
這家伙逼你抽的嗎
Did this guy make you smoke?

642
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,590
什么  你說什么呢
What? How dare you?

643
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,630
沒人能逼我做任何事
No one makes me do anything.

644
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,470
好了  我們去走走
All right, well, let's go for a walk.

645
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,430
不行  我們得回去留堂
No, she can't, we have to get back to detention.

646
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,770
-她這樣子不行  -走吧  艾瑞卡
- Not like this she can't. - Come on, Erica,

647
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,910
我們真的該回去了
we really should get back now, okay?

648
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,030
沒事的  伙計
It's cool, bro.

649
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,950
好吧  我跟她可是一起很久了
Okay, we got a long history together.

650
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,240
非常非常久了
Way too much history together.

651
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,540
走吧  艾瑞卡
Let's go, Erica.

652
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,030
我們回頭圖書館見
I'll meet you back at the library.

653
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,720
我自己會走
I can walk!

654
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,020
這玩意真臭
That shit smells.

655
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
你覺得阿姆斯特朗真的要把我們都鎖起來嗎
You think Armstrong was serious about locking us in?

656
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,100
也許吧
Probably.

657
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,960
我先去我車上拿點東西
Let me get something from my car first.

658
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,100
我不懂了  誰盯著你們幾個
I don't understand, who's watching you guys?

659
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,840
阿姆斯特朗老師  但看來他是個酒鬼
Mr. Armstrong, but apparently he's an alcoholic.

660
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,720
別告訴別人
Don't tell anyone.

661
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,740
所以他給了你們大麻
So he's giving you guys weed.

662
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,890
不是
No.

663
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,390
不是
No, no.

664
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,350
說來話長
It's a long story.

665
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,140
我們在哪
Where are we?

666
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,650
我不知道
I don't know.

667
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,860
我們就是玩玩
We're just chilling.

668
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,790
我正準備告訴全校人
So, I was just getting ready to tell everybody at school

669
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,860
我看到你周六來留堂了
I saw you here at Saturday detention,

670
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,740
但我打算給你個機會阻止我
but I was gonna give you a chance to stop me.

671
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,080
我告訴你個秘密吧
How about I tell you a secret?

672
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,210
說吧
Go on.

673
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,630
雖然我一整個夏天都躲你
Even though I ghosted you all summer,

674
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,220
我還是每11分鐘看一次你的主頁
I was still checking your profile every 11 minutes.

675
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,550
好吧
Okay.

676
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,180
這下我們有進展了
Now we're getting somewhere.

677
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,150
你什么意思
So, what are you saying?

678
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,490
我不知道
I don't know.

679
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,140
怎么了
What, what, what?

680
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,880
我好
I'm so...

681
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,900
怎么
Yeah?

682
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,260
嗨
...high.

683
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,050
我好嗨
I'm so high,

684
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,100
而且好餓
and really, really hungry.

685
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,470
好吧  那...
All right. Well, hey, hey.

686
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,600
我們回頭給你找東西吃
We'll feed you later.

687
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:43,190
不  我要去找自動販售機
No. I'm going to the vending machine.

688
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,520
現在嗎
Right now?

689
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,860
我要昏過去了
I'm going to pass out.

690
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,450
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

691
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,200
那混蛋酒鬼把我們鎖起來了
That fucking drunk actually locked us in.

692
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,420
椒鹽餅  沒有嗎
Pretzels... maybe not.

693
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,820
薯片
Chips, chips, chips, chips.

694
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,450
巧克力  花生
Chocolate and peanuts.

695
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,040
那個不錯
That could be good.

696
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,670
好決定
That's a good call.

697
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,880
不錯
That's good.

698
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,760
誰想要一堆干果
Who wants a bunch of nuts?

699
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,850
巧克力
The chocolate.

700
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,560
那個不錯啊
That seems like that's the one.

701
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,030
好吧
All right.

702
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,030
好啦
Oh, there we go.

703
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,110
該死
Oh, shoot.

704
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,090
給我點時間
Just give me one second!

705
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,930
艾瑞卡
Erica?

706
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,940
艾瑞卡
Erica.

707
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,030
艾瑞卡  別鬧了
Erica, quit playing.

708
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,660
你是想報復我之前嚇唬你嗎
You just trying to get me back for scaring you earlier?

709
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,340
杰森·爾文自己控球
Jason Irving takes the ball himself.

710
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,590
他打斷了防守的腳踝
He breaks the ankle of the defender!

711
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,510
他又打斷了一個
He breaks another one!

712
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,220
誰去叫醫務人員
Somebody get a medic!

713
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,150
這怎么回事
What's this?

714
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,690
艾瑞卡·楊等在邊緣嗎
Erica Yang is waiting at the rim?

715
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,450
小心  艾瑞卡
Watch out, Erica.

716
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,160
你要被攔截了
You about to get crossed up!

717
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,290
搞什么
What the fuck?

718
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,240
杰森
Jason?

719
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,730
如果你是想嚇我
If you're trying to scare me,

720
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,960
我可以告訴你那很沒意思
I can tell you that's a turnoff.

721
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,470
這可不好玩
This isn't funny.

722
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,650
好吧  我給你兩分鐘
Okay, I'm going to give you two minutes

723
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,010
不出來我就回去留堂了
or I'm going back to detention.

724
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,230
我剛用廁紙清理過
I just cleaned it up with paper towels.

725
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,280
太好了
Fantastic.

726
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,400
艾瑞卡呢
Where's Erica?

727
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,380
你沒丟下她自己吧
You didn't just leave her by herself, did you?

728
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,620
她正嗨著呢
She's baked right now.

729
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,500
我不知道  她在自己玩呢
I don't know. She was doing her own thing.

730
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,790
那什么意思
What does that mean?

731
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,420
你沒見過艾瑞卡吧
You haven't seen Erica, have you?

732
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,380
沒有
Nope.

733
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,500
但阿姆斯特朗可把我們關在這里了
But Armstrong for sure locked us in.

734
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,800
好吧
All right.

735
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,130
我走了
I'm leaving.

736
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,350
杰森
Jason?

737
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,100
什么叫"她在自己玩呢"
What do you mean, "she's doing her own thing"?

738
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:30,490
我跟你說話呢
Hey, I'm talking to you.

739
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,100
你今天做的還不夠多嗎
Haven't you done enough for today?

740
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,370
如果你那么擔心她嗨大了
If you're so worried she's stoned,

741
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,400
你為什么要帶電子煙來
why did you bring the vape pen in the first place?

742
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,830
你什么毛病
The fuck is your problem, bro?

743
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,900
你把大家都拉低到了你的水平線
You're bringing everyone down to your level.

744
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,710
這讓你覺得不那么糟糕了嗎
Does it make you feel like less of a screw-up?

745
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,950
喂  別那么對她說話
Yo. Don't talk to her like that.

746
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,500
你不了解我
You don't know me.

747
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,540
你在這兒呢
There you are.

748
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,460
抱歉
Sorry.

749
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,900
我剛剛跟個朋友在一起
I was...with a friend.

750
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,440
這家伙企圖泡你了嗎
Did this guy try to make a move on you?

751
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,220
沒有
No.

752
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,720
我剛剛跟杰森在一起
I was...with Jason.

753
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,070
前男友
The ex-boyfriend!

754
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,770
你出現幻覺了嗎
Are you hallucinating?

755
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,450
因為樓里沒人
'Cause there's no one in the building.

756
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,440
已經封鎖了
It's locked.

757
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,440
那他肯定是在之前進來的吧
He must have gotten in beforehand, right?

758
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,290
嗯  我們本來在一起
Yeah. We were hanging out,

759
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,440
然后我離開了一下
and then I left for a second,

760
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,360
再回去時  他就不見了
and when I came back, he was gone.

761
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,360
他肯定在樓里
Well, he's gotta be here somewhere.

762
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,990
除非他被阿姆斯特朗逮到了
Unless Armstrong caught him.

763
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,160
那很奇怪
But that is really weird, 'cause...

764
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,510
因為拉斯也是突然就走了
Russ left without a word, too.

765
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,460
別那么多戲了
Stop being so dramatic.

766
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,680
他經常突然走人
He ditches all the time.

767
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,480
才不呢  我們在一起時不會
No he doesn't, not when we're together.

768
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,850
那學校鬼魂可能把他綁了起來
Okay, so then, the School Spirit probably has him chained up,

769
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,810
給他吸了一發  他可能正爽著呢
sucking him off. He's probably loving it right now.

770
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,480
哥們  為什么每次我想跟你說認真的事
Dude, why is it that every time I try to get serious with you,

771
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,320
你都自動說些蠢話
you automatically say something stupid

772
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,390
從不回答問題
and never fucking answer the question?

773
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,810
好奇怪  杰森居然那樣丟下我
It is really weird Jason would just ditch me like that.

774
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,770
你看到他了嗎
Did you see him?

775
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,210
我就拿了拖把然后回來了
I, uh, I just got the mop and came back here,

776
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,070
我以為你倆會想獨處
I assumed you guys wanted to be alone.

777
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,490
我們該告訴阿姆斯特朗老師嗎
Should we tell Mr. Armstrong?

778
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,780
說什么
For what?

779
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,090
他可能真逮到了誰
I mean, he probably did catch somebody,

780
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,170
只是不想出來
he's just staying low-key

781
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,790
因為這位預科生發現了他口里的酒氣
after preppy here called him out on his alcohol breath.

782
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,490
{\an8}8月24日  星期六留堂細節

783
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,790
{\an8}伊麗莎白·惠特莫爾
拉塞爾·瓊斯
小維·卡斯特羅  +8個星期六
布雷特·卡勒維
艾瑞卡·楊

784
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,590
好吧  聽著
Okay, look.

785
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,950
今天接下去的時間我們就待在這吧
Let's just stay in here for the rest of the day,

786
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,680
尤其是阿姆斯特朗老師已經醉了
especially if Mr. Armstrong's already drunk

787
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,800
而且發生了不少怪事
and weird things are happening.

788
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,970
沒發生什么怪事
Nothing weird is happening,

789
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,260
除了現在已過了午飯時間
other than it's past lunchtime

790
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,600
而那蠢貨還沒回來放我們休息
and that idiot isn't back yet to let us go on break.

791
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,680
不  我要去他辦公室拿我的手機
No, I'm gonna go grab my phone from his office.

792
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,390
也許我該跟你一起去找杰森
Maybe I should go with you and look for Jason.

793
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,880
我說話時到底有沒有人聽
Does anyone ever listen to me when I say stuff?

794
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,900
我們聽到你說的了
We hear what you're saying,

795
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,050
但你說的太沒勁兒
it's just that what you're saying sucks.

796
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:17,850
聽著
Look.

797
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,190
艾瑞卡不希望今天的事被人知道
Erica's trying to keep a low profile today,

798
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,770
學校又被封鎖了
and the school's on lockdown.

799
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,280
外面的一切看上去都很危險
Everything just seems dangerous out there.

800
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,410
老兄  我說的校鬼故事是鬧著玩的
Dude, I was playing around with the whole School Spirit stuff.

801
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,990
那個僵尸女老師是假的
The zombie teacher lady isn't real.

802
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,910
你現在變得像個膽小鬼  你知道嗎
You're starting to sound like a real pussy, you know?

803
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:37,950
是啊
Right.

804
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,540
你就勇敢了
And, what, you're the tough guy?

805
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,880
你說什么
What'd you say?

806
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,940
大聲點  你想讓別人聽到  我聽著呢
Speak up. You want people to listen, I'm listening.

807
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,570
各位
Guys!

808
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,860
我們沒時間吵架
We don't need this right now.

809
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,650
我承認我有點害怕
I can admit I'm a little scared.

810
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,510
也許還有點疑神疑鬼
Maybe I'm getting a little paranoid.

811
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,990
但我也知道你沒那么勇敢  維克多
But I also know you're not that tough, Victor.

812
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,850
你怎么不站起來當我面說
Why don't you stand up and say it to my face?

813
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,580
你可以肆意欺負我
You can bully me all you want.

814
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,660
我知道你為什么這么做
I know why you do it.

815
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,950
這話是什么意思
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

816
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:02,850
起來
Get up!

817
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,840
{\an8}歡迎回來  上將

818
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,070
你覺得自己比我強嗎
You think you're better than me?

819
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,150
你想見識下硬漢嗎
You wanna see a tough guy?

820
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,320
怎么回事
What is this?

821
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,740
維克多  坐下
Victor, sit your ass down.

822
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,370
我干什么了
What did I do?

823
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,470
去走廊站著
Out in the hallway.

824
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,520
我得打個電話
I need to make a phone call.

825
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,880
伊麗莎白  閉嘴
Elizabeth, shut your mouth.

826
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,440
拜托  我什么也沒做
Please, I didn't do anything!

827
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,220
等等  阿姆斯特朗先生
Wait! Mr. Armstrong!

828
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,870
我嗑藥的勁兒肯定過了
My high is definitely wearing off.

829
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,000
好了
All right.

830
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,410
我受夠了
I'm done with this shit.

831
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,270
我要找方法離開這里
I'm figuring out a way to get out of here.

832
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,730
老兄  你就不能冷靜會兒
Dude, can you just chill for one second?

833
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,510
我覺得我們該待在一起
I think we should stay together.

834
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,840
別誤會了  艾瑞卡·楊
Don't get it twisted, Erica Yang.

835
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,760
我們不是朋友
We're not friends.

836
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,900
我知道周一時
I know when Monday comes,

837
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,320
你還會一副不認識我的樣子
you're gonna act like you don't know me,

838
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,100
所以我打算按自己的想法辦事
so I'm gonna go do my own thing.

839
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,020
對了  別忘了
Oh, and don't forget.

840
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,150
我知道你今天留堂了
I know you were here today.

841
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,320
我知道你在留堂時嗑藥了
I know you got high in detention.

842
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,780
小維有自己麻煩
Vic has his own stuff.

843
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,780
他有時會這樣
He gets like this sometimes.

844
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,970
你覺得他會告訴別人嗎
You think he'll tell anyone?

845
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,540
不不  他不是這樣的人
No, no, he's not like that.

846
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,970
我覺得我們該去拿手機
I think we should go get our phones.

847
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,000
嗯
Yeah.

848
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,980
你跟布雷特怎么了
So what's up with you and Brett?

849
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,920
沒怎么
Nothing.

850
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:50,880
我今天剛認識他
I just met him today.

851
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,970
他很喜歡你
He's really into you.

852
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,930
他是個好人
He's a nice guy.

853
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,180
他看你時有那種迷戀  渴望的眼神
He's got that infatuated, yearning look when he sees you.

854
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,870
別假裝你沒注意到
Don't pretend you don't notice.

855
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,810
咱倆雖不一樣  但我們都是女孩
You and I are different, but we're both girls.

856
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,700
我知道你知道我知道布雷特喜歡你
I know you know that I know that Brett likes you.

857
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,440
你也可能喜歡他
And you like him too, probably.

858
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,160
那是什么
What the fuck is that?

859
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,600
姐們  你干什么  你去哪
Dude, what are you doing, where are you--

860
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,290
我們還是得拿手機
Shh! We still need our phones.

861
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,050
好吧
Okay.

862
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,380
好吧
Okay.

863
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,980
布雷特
Brett?

864
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,490
阿姆斯特朗老師
Mr. Armstrong?

865
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,330
好吧
Okay.

866
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,380
{\an8}阿姆斯特朗老師

867
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,350
我們是來拿手機
We're here to get our phones.

868
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,640
還有鑰匙
And the keys.

869
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,270
該死
Aww, shit!

870
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,820
媽的
Oh, fuck!

871
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,740
我沒見到我們手機或鑰匙
I don't see our phones or the keys.

872
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,200
不在他包理
It's not in his bag.

873
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,200
{\an8}8月24日  留堂詳情
以下學生將在學期首周留堂
請注意新規定  由于赫布魯克高中失蹤學生數量增加

維克多·卡斯特羅  破壞公物
拉塞爾·瓊斯  曠課
伊麗莎白·惠特莫爾  違抗命令
艾瑞卡·楊  作弊

874
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,450
你留堂是因為作弊
You're in detention for cheating?

875
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:46,950
什么
What?

876
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,510
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

877
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,750
在阿姆斯特朗老師的留堂郵件里寫著呢
It's on Armstrong's detention email.

878
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,420
這就是你的大秘密
That's your big secret?

879
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,880
{\an8}失蹤人口  內森·列維
梅麗莎·凱斯

880
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,270
你知道
You know...

881
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,690
布雷特被阿姆斯特朗老師
Brett had this worried look on his face

882
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,490
帶走時臉上有種非常焦慮的表情
when Mr. Armstrong was taking him away.

883
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,700
就像他知道自己要遭遇不好的事了
Like he knew something bad was going to happen to him.

884
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,810
{\an8}失蹤人口  邁克·斯萊特
杰茜卡·帕克
大衛·威爾遜
內森·列維
梅麗莎·凱斯

885
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,040
好吧
Okay.

886
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,630
那血  消失進墻里了
The blood. It disappears into the wall.

887
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,340
怎么了
What is happening?

888
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,340
這會我們該走了
This is when we get the fuck out of here.

889
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,760
所以是真的
So it's true.

890
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,560
確實有僵尸老師帶走壞學生
There's some zombie teacher lady taking bad students.

891
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,900
如果是真的  那阿姆斯特朗是什么角色
If that's true, then where does Armstrong fit in all this?

892
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,770
我們去找小維吧
Let's just find Vic.

893
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,570
那是...
Is that...

894
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,950
阿姆斯特朗老師
Mr. Armstrong?

895
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,410
是你嗎
Is that you?

896
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,450
你把杰森怎么了
What'd you do with Jason?

897
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,580
-拉斯在哪  -還有布雷特
- Where's Russ? - And Brett?

898
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,500
你不能把我們關在這里
You know you can't keep us here!

899
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,640
我們不是壞學生
We're not bad students!

900
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,010
學校這么爛也不是我們的錯
It's not our fault that this school sucks!

901
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:27,980
該死  跑  快點
Oh, shit. Run, go!

902
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:28,760
該死
Fuck!

903
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:31,970
該死
Fuck.

904
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,970
對不起  我總是閉不上嘴
I'm sorry, I can just never keep my mouth shut.

905
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,700
{\an8}回到學校

906
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,440
喂
Yo!

907
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,660
去這  去這
Okay, in here, in here.

908
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,410
好吧
Okay.

909
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,850
看  也沒那么傻
See? Not so dumb after all.

910
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,270
真不敢相信發生了這事
I can't believe this is happening.

911
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,980
我會永遠和這些聯系在一起
I'm forever going to be associated with this.

912
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,980
你知道嗎  我開始厭煩你的抱怨了
You know what? I'm getting really sick of you complaining.

913
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,300
你為什么這么在乎別人怎么想
Why do you care so much about what people think?

914
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,510
這里能出去嗎
Can we go out this way?

915
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,030
這里為什么有圍欄
Why are these bars here?

916
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,100
是為了防止我們出去還是不讓我們進來
Are they to keep us out or keep us in?

917
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,660
我們得離開這里
We need to get out of here.

918
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,310
我們不能一直躲在這里
We can't just hide here forever.

919
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:07,610
這是什么教室
What room are we in?

920
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,230
化學實驗室
The chemistry lab.

921
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,780
太好了  這樣我們就能做個炸彈之類的
Great. So we can, like, make a bomb or something.

922
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,320
他還在外面嗎
Is he still out there?

923
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,130
他們是不是說過
Didn't they say, like,

924
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,630
不要把什么東西和什么東西混在一起
don't mix something with something else,

925
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,910
否則后果很嚴重
or, like, it'd be really bad?

926
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,330
有硫酸嗎
Is there sulfuric acid?

927
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:16,130
{\an8}上將隊

928
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,880
太蠢了
So dumb.

929
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,150
我一直以為我會是赫布魯克第一位
I always thought I'd be the first student from Helbrook

930
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,550
考上哈佛的學生
to make it to Harvard.

931
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:45,560
這個鬼地方沒人考上過哈佛嗎
No one from this hell hole has ever gone to Harvard?

932
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,570
沒有
Never.

933
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,850
這正是我每年都刻苦學習的原因
That's why I slaved away every year,

934
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,620
創造了想讀哈佛大學的愿望
created this whole Harvard-bound image,

935
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:55,360
和每個老師搞好關系  這樣就能拿到推薦信
sucked up to every teacher so I could get letters of recommendation.

936
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,440
其實...
Well...

937
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:58,690
并沒有結束
it isn't over.

938
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,670
我們要離開這里
We're getting out of this.

939
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:01,360
不
No.

940
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,820
都結束了
It's over.

941
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,830
我不會從赫布魯克拿到一封推薦信
I'm not getting any recommendations from Helbrook.

942
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,310
只是因為你作弊被抓嗎
Just 'cause you were caught cheating?

943
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,040
其實...
Well...

944
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,480
我真正想做的是賄賂阿姆斯特朗老師
what I actually tried to do was bribe Mr. Armstrong

945
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,640
讓他進入教務系統
to go into the system

946
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:18,590
把一堆A-改為A
and change a couple A-minuses I had to As

947
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,220
來得到最高的平均分
to get the max GPA.

948
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:25,430
我猜他會收下的
I guess I assumed he'd take it.

949
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,560
我猜錯了
I was wrong.

950
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:29,890
他還真是個正派的人
The guy actually cares.

951
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,150
如果我知道會發生這一切
If I knew all this was going to happen,

952
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,400
我就不會那么努力了
I wouldn't have tried so hard.

953
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,010
振作起來  老兄  你能行的
Come on, man, you fucking got this,

954
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,080
你能行的  別像個娘們似的
you got this, don't be a fucking pussy.

955
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,920
該死
Fuck this, man!

956
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:17,520
抱歉  我只想找到我的朋友
I'm-I'm sorry, I was just trying to find my friend.

957
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,490
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

958
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,750
你聽到了嗎
Do you hear that?

959
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,790
什么
What?

960
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:42,550
那是...
Is that...

961
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,630
有人求救嗎
someone calling for help?

962
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,260
是小維嗎
Is that Vic?

963
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,280
聲音是從哪里傳來的
Where's that coming from?

964
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,890
我覺得是從天花板上傳來的
I think it's coming from the ceiling.

965
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,120
你在干什么
What are you doing?

966
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,100
幫我一把
Help me up.

967
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,370
你瘋了嗎
Are you crazy?

968
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,780
如果那東西在上面呢
What if that thing's up there?

969
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,200
小維
Vic?

970
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,990
麗莎
Lizzy!

971
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,440
該死
Fuck.

972
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,010
聽我說  拜托  我不是...
Look, please, I'm not...

973
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,310
不  不
No, no!

974
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,530
麗莎
Lizzy!

975
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,700
不  不
No! No!

976
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,200
麗莎  不
Lizzy, no!

977
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,680
我要離開這里
I'm going out there.

978
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,930
-什么 -我去拉響火警
- What?  - I'm gonna--I'm gonna pull the fire alarm,

979
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,520
然后消防隊就會來救我們
and then the fire department will have to come and save us.

980
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,520
好吧
Okay.

981
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,440
小心點
Be careful.

982
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,780
好的
Okay.

983
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:28,900
開門
Hey, open up!

984
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,670
天啊  開門
Oh my god, open the door!

985
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:32,420
是布雷特嗎
Is that Brett?

986
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,720
拜托  阿姆斯特朗老師在外面  他瘋了
Please, Mr. Armstrong's out here, he's lost his mind.

987
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,720
小維和你在一起嗎
Is Vic with you?

988
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,540
沒有  我不知道  讓我進去好嗎
No, I don't know, just let me in, okay?

989
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,510
先去拉響火警
Go pull the fire alarm first.

990
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,100
你在干什么  為什么把我鎖在外面
What are you doing, why are you locking me out?

991
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,430
去拉響火警  你已經在外面了
Pull the fire alarm, you're already out there!

992
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,430
我不想死
I don't want to die!

993
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,480
艾瑞卡  拜托
Erica, please.

994
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,900
-讓他進來吧  -好吧  好吧
- Just let him in. - Okay, okay,

995
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,210
讓我把這東西放下來
just let me put this down.

996
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:48,920
好
Okay.

997
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,370
你還是要把門鎖上
You still have to lock the door.

998
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,390
我能鎖
I can do it.

999
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,580
小維在哪
Where's Vic?

1000
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,750
你們知道小維關于校鬼沒說什么嗎
You know what Vic didn't mention about the School Spirit?

1001
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,350
那個被學生丟在地下室
The old teacher the kids left to rot

1002
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:26,800
任由其腐爛的老師
in the cellar on campus?

1003
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:29,840
那是...
It's that...

1004
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,630
她有個孩子
she had a son.

1005
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,450
我就知道有點不對勁
I fucking knew something was up.

1006
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,680
他的名字不在留堂名單里
His name wasn't on the detention list.

1007
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:40,730
我想告訴你們大伙留在教室里
I was trying to tell you guys just to stay in the classroom.

1008
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,980
我不理解你們為什么
I don't get why you guys can't just

1009
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,870
就不能尊重赫布魯克
treat Helbrook with respect.

1010
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:47,500
赫布魯克因為學生們的表現太差
You know, Helbrook doesn't receive the public funding it needs

1011
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,320
所以收不到資助基金
because of the students' poor performance.

1012
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,650
你們知道嗎
Did you know that?

1013
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,620
但是  如果有學生能考上哈佛大學
Although, if someone were to get into Harvard...

1014
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,120
這的確能改變現狀
that would really change things.

1015
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,790
但當我聽到你作弊
But when I heard that you cheated,

1016
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,460
我真的很失望
I was really disappointed.

1017
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,880
還有賄賂  是怎么回事
And what was that, bribery?

1018
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,680
艾瑞卡
Erica.

1019
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:17,350
你是赫布魯克最棒的學生
You're Helbrook's greatest student.

1020
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,220
年度最佳學生
The perfect Admiral.

1021
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,980
告訴我這不是你干的
Tell me you didn't do that!

1022
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,440
-布雷特  -告訴我你沒把事情搞砸
- Brett...  - Tell me you didn't screw it up.

1023
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,820
告訴我你不是壞孩子之一
Tell me you're not just one of the bad kids.

1024
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,380
告訴我
Tell me!

1025
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,150
混帳東西
Hey, fuck face!

1026
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,340
艾瑞卡
Erica?

1027
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,180
艾瑞卡
Erica!

1028
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,430
艾瑞卡
Erica!

1029
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,650
艾瑞卡
Erica!

1030
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,790
艾瑞卡
Erica?

1031
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,670
艾瑞卡
Erica!

1032
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:22,760
艾瑞卡
Erica!

1033
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,320
我在哪里
Where am I?

1034
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,490
你醒了
Oh, hey.

1035
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,120
抱歉  等一下
Sorry, just a moment.

1036
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,550
抱歉我之前有些生氣
Sorry if I was a bit angry earlier.

1037
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,180
今天真的很不順利
This day really didn't go well.

1038
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,180
我媽媽警告過我
My mom warned me.

1039
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,180
她教書的時候經常帶我來赫布魯克
She used to bring me to Helbrook when she was teaching.

1040
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:55,020
她帶我來這里  為了讓我遠離那些壞孩子
She kept me in here to protect me from the bad kids.

1041
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,950
我從小在家里受教育
I was homeschooled as a boy

1042
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:07,700
但最后這里卻成了我的家
but ended up making this place my home.

1043
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:10,620
這里很不錯吧
It's neat, isn't it?

1044
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:17,520
今天早上  我很震驚
This morning, I was shocked.

1045
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,300
我真是不敢相信我的眼睛
I... I couldn't believe my eyes.

1046
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,680
艾瑞卡·楊  參加周末留堂
Erica Yang, weekend detention?

1047
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,060
我本來只想袖手旁觀的  但后來我想
I was just gonna watch, but then I thought,

1048
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:36,520
"還記得艾瑞卡說的嗎
"Hey, remember that thing Erica said?

1049
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,400
"這是最后一年了
'It's the final year,

1050
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,480
以后我們可能就見不到彼此了  所以
and after this, we may never see each other again, so...

1051
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,740
不要留下遺憾"
let's not have any regrets.'"

1052
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,830
我一直很想和你說上話
I always wanted to talk to you.

1053
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,000
看
See?

1054
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,650
{\an8}赫布魯克的艾瑞卡·楊勇奪數學競賽冠軍

1055
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,760
我真的很喜歡你的臉
I just love your face.

1056
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,600
我從高一時就關注你了
I've been following you since freshman year.

1057
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:16,910
{\an8}赫布魯克的艾瑞卡·楊

1058
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,150
自從你代表赫布魯克贏下了那次數學競賽
Ever since you won that math contest for Helbrook.

1059
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:21,200
{\an8}赫布魯克  艾瑞卡·楊

1060
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,570
我和媽媽都很自豪
Mom and I were so proud.

1061
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,950
你是我們最耀眼的明星
You're the brightest star we ever had.

1062
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,830
你總是非常尊重和熱愛這所學校
You always treated the school with honor and respect,

1063
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:39,580
這是我們最想要的
and that's all we wanted.

1064
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,090
直到今天
Until today.

1065
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,110
艾瑞卡
Erica.

1066
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,450
你那么努力
You worked so hard!

1067
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:08,880
我們都很支持你
We were all rooting for you,

1068
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,570
你為什么背叛我們
why did you betray us?

1069
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:11,570
我沒有
I didn't.

1070
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,760
我犯了一個錯誤
I made a mistake.

1071
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,830
肯定是他引誘你的  對嗎
Well, he must have tricked you, didn't he?

1072
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,890
我想我是被壓力擊垮了
I guess the pressure was getting to me.

1073
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,520
不  你不能向壓力屈服  艾瑞卡
No, you can't succumb to pressure, Erica!

1074
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,550
特別是同輩壓力  好嗎
Especially peer pressure, okay?

1075
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,380
比如說今天
Take today, for instance.

1076
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,930
如果我沒有阻止拉斯
If I didn't stop Russ,

1077
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,800
他就會讓你在校園里未成年喝酒
he was gonna get you to commit underage drinking on campus.

1078
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:34,530
我無法阻止你抽煙
And I couldn't stop you from vaping,

1079
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,820
但我阻止了杰森趁你在那種情況下
but I did stop Jason from taking your virginity

1080
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,350
奪走你的童貞
while you were under the influence.

1081
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,230
幸好我今天來了
Thank god I came today.

1082
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:45,610
不然你這樣一個好女孩就被毀了
It would have ruined a good girl like you.

1083
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,780
你真好
That's so sweet.

1084
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:05,650
至少阿姆斯特朗先生不會再告訴任何人
At least Mr. Armstrong won't be telling anyone

1085
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:07,380
關于你賄賂的事了
about your bribe, huh?

1086
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,890
我一般不會干掉教職員
I don't usually remove faculty...

1087
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,850
但是今天出現了一些額外情況
...but there were some extenuating circumstances today.

1088
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,170
我去年和這些家伙一起留堂
I sat in detention with these guys last year

1089
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,490
想要說服他們變好  但是
and tried to convince them to be good, but...

1090
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,360
有的學生就是沒有希望
some students are just hopeless.

1091
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:36,990
真不敢相信有人會這么在乎
I can't believe anyone cares so much.

1092
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,870
我當然在乎了  我
Of course I care, I...

1093
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,500
我希望有更多學生會在乎
I wish more students cared.

1094
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:44,000
我同意
I agree.

1095
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:50,170
謝謝你  布雷特  這么照顧我
Thank you, Brett, for looking out for me.

1096
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:54,680
我很遺憾你住在天花板里
I'm sorry that you live in the cellar.

1097
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,470
你肯定很孤單吧
It must get lonely.

1098
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:00,490
我不介意
I don't mind it.

1099
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:03,560
我今天和你一起真的很開心
I really had a nice time with you today.

1100
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,730
我也是
I did as well.

1101
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:08,230
真可惜
It's a shame.

1102
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,070
我覺得我們真的很合得來
I felt like we were really getting along.

1103
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:14,070
我其實也這么感覺
I felt that too, actually.

1104
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,780
我覺得我們可以成為朋友的
I think we could have been friends.

1105
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,120
一起出去玩  一起學習
Hung out, studied together.

1106
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,580
也許我們可以
Maybe we could even have...

1107
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,980
一起去舞會
gone to a dance together.

1108
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,170
真的嗎
Really?

1109
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,810
你參加過舞會嗎
Have you ever been to a dance?

1110
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,300
沒有  我不能去  但是
No, I'm--I'm not allowed, but...

1111
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,170
很棒吧
Isn't this nice?

1112
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,630
是的
Yeah.

1113
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,760
我只能經常自己想象
I have to use my imagination a lot.

1114
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:17,680
你和我經常一起去參加舞會
You and I have gone to many dances together.

1115
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:22,180
你現在不用想象了
Well, you don't have to use your imagination.

1116
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,560
我就在這里
I'm right here.

1117
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,900
我媽媽不希望我和這些學生交流
Well, my mom doesn't want me interacting with the students.

1118
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:38,660
但我不是那些壞孩子
But I'm not one of the bad ones.

1119
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,580
是我
It's me.

1120
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,080
艾瑞卡·楊  年度最佳學生
Erica Yang, Admiral of the Year.

1121
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:48,370
為了進入哈佛努力學習
Studied hard so I can get into Harvard.

1122
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:01,760
好吧
Okay.

1123
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,680
我能和你跳一支舞嗎
May I have this dance?

1124
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,070
看
See?

1125
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,410
你做得很不錯
You're good.

1126
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,160
布雷特
Hey, Brett?

1127
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:07,910
嗯
Yeah?

1128
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:12,170
我知道你這些年來一直在
I know you've watched over the school

1129
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:14,920
注視著這所學校
all of these years, and...

1130
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:21,640
我知道你很懂好學生應該怎么做
...you're an expert on how students should be.

1131
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,260
你可以這么說吧
I guess you could say that.

1132
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,640
但是  你有沒有
But, do you ever...

1133
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,100
想過你自己
...think about yourself?

1134
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,940
你知道你最瘋狂的事是什么嗎
Want to know the craziest part about you?

1135
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:41,670
你竟然認為我真的  真的會想和
That you think I would ever, ever want to dance

1136
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,320
你這樣的瘋子跳舞
with a psycho like you.

1137
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,990
你在開玩笑嗎
Are you fucking kidding me?

1138
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,500
順便  我經常作弊
By the way, I cheat all the time.

1139
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,060
我恨學校  但我還是很棒
I hate school, but I do well anyway

1140
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,920
因為這對我來說生死攸關
because it is life or death for me.

1141
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,340
你不了解我的父母  布雷特
You don't know my parents, Brett,

1142
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,050
所以不要假裝你好像很了解我似的
so don't act like you know a thing about me.

1143
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:01,760
媽媽
Mama...

1144
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,220
還有一件事
One more thing:

1145
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:05,680
我不是你的天使
I'm not your angel.

1146
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:09,600
我和杰森做過27次了
I've had sex with Jason 27 times already,

1147
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,640
我給三個不同的家伙口過
and I've given three different guys blow jobs.

1148
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,480
我很抱歉
Sorry about it.

1149
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,350
你在流血嗎
Are you bleeding?

1150
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:49,890
-你受傷了嗎  -不
- Are you hurt? - No.

1151
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,060
不  這不是我的血
No, it-- it's not mine.

1152
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,100
你從哪里出來的
Where did you come from?

1153
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,060
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

1154
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:58,020
我叫艾瑞卡·楊
My name is Erica Yang.

1155
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:01,360
我在留...
I was in det...

1156
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,370
我在學校里進行我的周末社區服務
I was on campus for my weekly community service.

1157
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,700
然后我聽到我的朋友們
And that's when I heard my friends

1158
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,620
在樓里大喊救命
calling for help inside the building.

1159
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,710
我就想去救他們
I tried to help them.

1160
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,380
我盡力了
I did the best that I could.

1161
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:27,140
伊麗莎白和我想盡辦法想逃出來
Elizabeth and I did our best to escape,

1162
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:31,930
但我最終還是被一個精神病殺人狂抓住了
but I was ultimately held captive by a psychotic murderer.

1163
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:35,240
就算在那一刻
Even in that moment,

1164
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,810
我滿腦子里也只有
all I could think was,

1165
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:40,020
"我那么努力才走到今天
"I've worked so hard to get here.

1166
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:43,190
我快要完成我的哈佛申請了
I'm almost done with my Harvard application.

1167
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,070
我不能掉鏈子
I can't get derailed.

1168
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,990
求你了
Please.

1169
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:48,820
不要讓我死"
Don't let me die."

1170
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,410
但是
But...

1171
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:57,790
我堅持了下來  活了下來
I persevered and I survived.

1172
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,880
我覺得這次的經歷讓我更加的堅強
I think this whole experience has made me stronger.

1173
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:07,220
現在  我已經開始繼續準備我的大學申請
And now, I've gotta get back to my college applications.

1174
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:15,890
至少我現在的個人介紹有很多可以寫了
Hey, at least I've got one heck of a personal essay to write.
