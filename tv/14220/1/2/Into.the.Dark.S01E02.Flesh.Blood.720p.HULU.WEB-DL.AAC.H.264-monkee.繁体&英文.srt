Your mother's death was a terrible loss to endure at your age.

255

英年早逝是一回事
It's one thing when a person dies before their time,

256

遭遇后  怪自己也是很常的事
And it's common after a traumatic experience to blame yourself.

271
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,600
我槭裁匆那么做
Why would I do that?

272
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,950
又不是我⑺懒怂
I didn't kill her.

Am I cured now?

280
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,390
我X得你很害怕
I think you're afraid

281
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,910
是因榉赶逻@些罪行的人]有被抓住

你不能永h待在@里
You can't stay in here forever.

也S我可以慢慢
Maybe we could take our time with that.

1035
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:02,610
如果金伯利想要  那@是她的x
Uh, if Kimberly wants to talk about that, it's her choice.

1036

P于她的遭遇  有那
You know, about what happened to her, and the man--

1041
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,400
那⑺浪的人
the man who killed her.

1042
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,190
我想^很多如果我有C的
I thought a lot about what I would say to him 

1043
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,020
我λf什么
if I ever had the chance.

1044
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,590
你要f什么呢
And what would that be?

1045
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,680
我不他槭裁
I wouldn't ask him why.

1046
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,410

我知道槭裁
I know why.

1048
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,310
他@么做因樗是B
He did it because he's sick.

1049
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,910
因樗很享受
Because he enjoys it.

1050
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:43,210
他也So自己找理由
He probably justifies it to himself.

1051
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:47,940
那N人樽约旱乃作所檎胰魏谓杩
A man like that invents excuses to do what he does.

1052
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:52,460
解他的病B
To excuse his own sickness.

1053
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,840
你得你第一次告V我我是在一O里
Remember you first told me that I was in a cocoon?

1054
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,410
就像一只暝的蝴蝶
Like a butterfly struggling to get out?

1055

也S他也在O里
Maybe he's in a cocoon, too.

1056
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,960
只不^  他躲在他的O里
Except... he hides in his,

1057
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,750
那里黑暗
where it's dark...

1058
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,840
]人能看到
where no one can see him

1059
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,420
真正的他

1060
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:24,090
我告V他  他是禽F  懦夫
And I'd tell him he's a monster and a coward.

1061
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,150
你X得他δ阏f什么
And what do you think he would say to you?

1062
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:37,960
恐怕今天就到此橹沽
I'm afraid that's all the time we have for today.

I think we were breaking new ground here, Kimberly.

1067

Um, maybe at our next session, we can venture outside

1068
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,700
也S能去院子里
maybe into the yard?

the butterfly is at its most vulnerable state in its life cycle.

1100

在那之前  它w不了
Until that's done, it can't fly.

1101
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,890
它只成轼B和其他捕食者的C物
And then it's easy prey for birds and other predators.

1102
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,510
你的聿焕斫
Your mother never understood that.

Second place. So proud.

但是她lF...
But then when she found out...

1107
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:15,310
@直就像把破碎的玻璃杯拼回起
yeah, it was like trying to put broken glass back together.

1108
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,110
我能怎么k
What was I supposed to do?

1109
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,850
她只告V警察
She was just gonna tell the cops,

1110
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,010
然后他就永h地ё吣
and then they'd take you away from me forever.

1111

你不想c任
You don't want to take a little personal responsibility for this?

1115
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:40,630
是你干的  @都是你的e  金伯利
You did this. This is your fault, Kimberly.

1116
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,440
如果你能乖乖
Dr. Saunders would still be alive 

1117
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,750
桑德斯t生F在能活著

有一天  你走出那扇T
One day, you're gonna walk out that door,

你明白  我槟阕@世界更加安全
and you'll get that I made the world a safer place for you.
