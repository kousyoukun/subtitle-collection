1
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,570
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

2
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,490
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving!

3
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,990
萝丝  亲爱的  你想帮我切一下吗
Rose, honey, want me to carve that?

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,410
亨利  亲爱的  要是让我切的话
Henry, my love, if I let you carve,

5
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,910
你们到明天都吃不上饭
we won't eat until tomorrow.

6
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,040
但我喜欢事情十全十美
I like things to be, you know, precise.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,330
是啊  但是我们已经饿了
Yes, but we're hungry now.

8
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,960
- 是吗  金  - 我们现在就饿了
\Isn't that right, Kim? \Yeah. Hungry now, Dad.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,460
妈妈切我们就有得吃
Mom carves, we eat.

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,000
你切我们就有得等
You carve, we wait.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,670
好嘞  饿死鬼们
All right, savages.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,340
少来这套
Yeah, nice try.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,590
既然是感恩节
So, this being Thanksgiving,

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,640
我提议
I say we get real

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,140
我们认真分享一下想要感谢的东西
and share something that each of us is thankful for.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,680
萝丝  你先来
You go first, Rose.

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,850
我很感激在遇见那两个神经病之后
I am thankful that I have you two to come home to

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,070
能把你们叫回来一起吃饭
after the nutjobs I deal with across the not\so\friendly skies.

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,820
你的笑脸让一切事物都变得美好起来了
Your smiling faces make everything okay.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,610
Sleep in your nova heart

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,740
那你呢  金米
How about you, Kimmy?

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,870
很感谢现在的这一切
For this.

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,950
还有我们
For us.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,540
- 好了  爸爸  该你了  - 嗯  该你了
\All right Dad, your turn. \Yeah, your turn.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,710
我就是很感激我不用切火鸡
Well, I'm just thankful I didn't have to carve the turkey

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,210
不然我会反胃
'cause my stomach's grumbling.

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,920
你看看
See?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,960
但是主要的  说实话
But mostly, in all honesty,

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,880
我想要永远都不失去你们两个
I just would never want to lose you two.

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,090
你们是我生命中的挚爱
You're the loves of my life.

31
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,180
为了这句话干杯
Cheers to that.

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,180
- 爱你们  - 爱你们
\Love you guys. \ Love you.

33
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,810
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,100
噢  抱歉  我不是故意要吓你的
Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,980
我下班了  你吃药没
I'm off. You take your meds?

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,110
金伯莉  别这样
Come on, Kimberly.

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,030
我不喜欢它们给我的感觉
I don't like the way they make me feel.

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,570
但问题是  他们有用
The problem is, they're helping.

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,030
把你的手爪爪伸出来
Give me your paw.

40
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,620
真乖
Good girl.

41
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,000
我知道你今天不想大肆庆祝
I know you don't want to make a big deal out of this today,

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,790
- 不过  - 嗯我不想
\but\\ \No, I don't.

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,130
好吧
Yeah, okay.

44
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,920
我们也不会  但是你的姑姑简给你送了东西过来
We won't. But your Aunt Jane sent something.

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,340
应该今天会到  所以记得在它被小混混
It should come today, so it'd probably better to bring it in

46
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,260
偷走之前从门口拿回来
before the local thieves snatch it from the stoop.

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,810
- 没有人会拿走的  - 真的吗
\No one's gonna take it. \Really?

48
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,060
告诉隔壁那兄弟
Tell that to neighbor dude.

49
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,060
他那天才丢了一个包裹
He lost a package the other day right off the front porch.

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,560
还有隔壁的隔壁那家老太太也是
Same for the old lady two doors down.

51
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,480
我知道你想做什么
I know what you're trying to do.

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
是啊
You do, don't you?

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,610
你当然知道了
Of course you do.

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,070
反正记得拿回来  不拿也行  好吗
Well, bring it in or not, okay?

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,160
要是我回来之前被拿走了  那就不是我的错
It's not my fault if somebody hijacks it before I get home.

56
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,000
拜拜
Bye.

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,510
They'll be on their own

58
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,720
And I'll sleep

59
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,930
Sleep in your nova heart

60
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,270
As things

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,230
Come apart

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,750
They walk in and sit down

63
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,420
With their mood of the day

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,960
They read books over tea

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,880
And they give tips when they pay

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,590
Butter and bread

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,970
Diet Coke and cake

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,260
She takes notes

69
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,060
She makes no mistakes

70
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,350
While daylight is fading

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,270
While traders are trading

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,230
While the jukebox is playing

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,030
And lovers are dating The waitress is waiting

74
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,240
For a thing to explode

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,450
For a light to go on

76
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,450
\*For some sign to show *\

77
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,540
Her time is yet to come

78
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,920
She's counting the days

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,260
Until real life arrives

80
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,670
She's counting

81
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,930
Two, three, four, five

82
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,180
And every minute feels just like the one before

83
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,060
No surprise, no twist

84
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,150
She wants so much more

85
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,320
While daylight is fading

86
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,450
While traders are trading

87
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,360
While players are playing

88
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,160
And lovers are dating The waitress is waiting

89
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,460
For a thing to explode

90
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,380
For a light to go on

91
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,680
For some sign to show

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,970
Her best is yet to come

93
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,700
靠
Shit.

94
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
金伯莉  这个在门廊里
Kimberly, this was on the front porch.

95
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,500
你能拿一下吗  这样我就可以收一下伞
Can you take it so I can put my umbrella down?

96
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,830
金
Kim?

97
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,960
金
Kim?

98
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,590
谢谢
Thank you.

99
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,800
怎么了
What happened?

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,470
我想去拿包裹
I tried to get the package.

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,180
你真棒
Oh, good for you.

102
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,810
你愿意走出舒适区很棒
It's important to push your boundaries.

103
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,230
等治疗结束了我们可以再试一试
Maybe we'll try again at the end of the session.

104
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,610
就是去车道上走一走
You know, take a stroll down the driveway.

105
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,860
试一试你的极限
Test your limits.

106
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,200
你今天十七岁啦  生日快乐
You turned 17 today. Happy Birthday.

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,330
嗯  不  不过又是新的一天而已
Yeah. No, just another day.

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,830
和别的一样
Same as any other.

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,540
你的每一天都是怎么个一样法
How are your days the same?

110
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,090
我起床  然后穿衣服
Well, I wake up. Um, I kind of get dressed.

111
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,510
然后做做作业
Um, I do my home\school stuff.

112
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,390
在家里坐着  等我爸爸
Sit around the house. Wait for my dad.

113
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,140
然后我们吃晚饭看电视  上床睡觉
Then we eat dinner and watch TV, and go to bed.

114
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,730
你觉得舍曲林怎么样
How are you finding the Sertraline?

115
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,020
它让我感到麻木
It makes me feel numb.

116
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,820
那是好事还是坏事
Is numb a good thing or a bad thing?

117
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,910
我看见你爸爸在修整家里啊
I see your dad is still fixing up the place.

118
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,500
是啊  他有时间的时候就弄弄
Oh, yeah. When he has the time.

119
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,920
他最近一直下班晚
You know, he's been working a lot lately.

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,590
你觉得你母亲会怎么说这一堆东西
What do you think your mom would say about all the mess?

121
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,520
她会觉得还好  还是会觉得乱七八糟的很烦
Or was she okay with the home improvement chaos?

122
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,520
你  你今天想谈谈她吗
Do you, um, want to talk about her today?

123
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,770
你已经失去她快一年了
It's been almost a year since you lost her.

124
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,440
我知道节日还有生日
And I know that holidays and birthdays

125
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,450
总能带起许多感情
can bring up some really strong emotions.

126
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,830
我也知道感恩节
And I also know Thanksgiving was the last holiday

127
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,870
是你们一起过的最后一个节日
that you and your dad got to spend with your mom.

128
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,540
不  只是新的一天而已
No. Just another day,

129
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,380
和别的天都一样
the same as any other.

130
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:15,630
我的病人里有很多和你症状相似的
Um, I've worked with many people with similar conditions to yours, Kim.

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,060
有焦虑症的  恐慌症发作的
People with anxiety disorders, panic attacks.

132
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,310
他们把在即从这个世界隔离出去了
The ones who cut themselves off from the world.

133
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,810
但是区别是你还是个正在发展的年轻女性
But the difference in your case is you are a developing, young woman,

134
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,440
你需要和真实的人谈谈话
and you need talk to someone real.

135
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,320
现在的人
Someone present.

136
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,440
好
Yeah.

137
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
我有我爸爸呢
And I have my dad.

138
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,990
是啊
Yeah. You do.

139
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,630
这太蠢了
This is so stupid.

140
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,090
别当个扫兴鬼
Aw, don't be a party pooper.

141
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,390
睁眼
Okay, open your eyes.

142
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,560
继续吧  许个愿
Go on, make a wish.

143
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,190
你许了什么
What'd you wish?

144
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,780
我告诉你就不会成真了
If I tell you, it won't come true, so...

145
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,410
他们是这样说的  不管他们是谁
That's what they say, whoever "they" are.

146
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,370
是关于妈妈的
It was about Mom.

147
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,630
这样可以吗
Is that okay?

148
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,540
当然
Of course.

149
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,840
来
Here goes.

150
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,220
看上去不错是吗
Looks good, huh?

151
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,430
顺便一提
Oh, by the way,

152
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,140
我知道你不想大肆庆祝  但是
I know you didn't want me to make a big deal out of things this year, but...

153
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,690
来  打开它
Go on. Open it.

154
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,070
- 哇哦  - 嗯
\Oh, wow. \Yeah.

155
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,780
真漂亮
It's so pretty.

156
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,360
戴上试试
Try it on.

157
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,830
给
Here.

158
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,420
- 好了  - 我想看看
\All right. \I want to see.

159
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,710
很好看
It's pretty.

160
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
谢谢
Thank you.

161
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,010
生日快乐亲爱的
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

162
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,720
谢谢
Thank you.

163
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,690
你的感恩节菜单上都有什么
What's on your Thanksgiving menu?

164
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,530
汤姆・艾金斯  我们的常驻主厨  有点想法
Tom Elkins, our resident chef, has ideas.

165
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,700
好了  我要去睡觉了
All right, well, I'm headed to bed.

166
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,410
好的亲爱的
All right, sweetheart.

167
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,620
- 谢谢你的蛋糕  - 没事

168
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,240
还有这个
And\\ and for this.

169
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,990
你姑姑给你寄了什么
What'd you get from your aunt?

170
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
一些新的茶叶
Just some new teas.

171
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,540
白玫瑰和祁门茶
Um, White Rose and Keemun,

172
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,460
还有一本关于克服恐惧的书
and this book on conquering your fears.

173
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,000
你姑姑的礼物很微妙
Oh, very subtle, your aunt.

174
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,760
是啊
Yeah.

175
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,010
你是自己出去拿的吗
And you got outside to go get it?

176
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,220
是吗  那真是太棒了
Right? So that's great.

177
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,720
不是
Um, no.

178
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,810
噢
Oh.

179
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,180
桑德斯医生那进来的
Dr. Saunders had to bring it in.

180
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,020
不过至少不是本地混混拿走的
Well, at least the local thieves were denied, so...

181
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,100
是啊
Yeah.

182
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,060
你今晚上吃药了吗
Did you take your meds tonight?

183
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,530
吃了
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,540
她想把我送走吗
Does she want to send me away?

185
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,790
谁
Who?

186
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,210
桑德斯医生
Dr. Saunders.

187
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,960
我不知道  有的时候
I don't know, sometimes I feel like

188
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,460
我觉得她想把我送去什么医院
she wants to put me away in a hospital or something.

189
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,550
不  亲爱的  没有人想把你送到什么地方去
No, honey, no one's sending you anywhere.

190
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,430
她只是来帮你走出这一切的
Dr. Saunders is just here to help you through this.

191
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,800
我们都是
We both are.

192
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,100
好
Okay.

193
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,970
去吧  睡会儿觉
Go on, get some sleep.

194
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,100
- 晚安  - 晚安亲爱的
\Good night. \Night, sweetheart.

195
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,150
还有十三天就到感恩节了  是否需要囤货
With thirteen days until Turkey Day. Stock up on all...

196
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,300
啥
What... ?

197
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,820
Stone throwers living inside a glass cage

198
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,700
金
\Kim? \

199
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,870
金
Kim?!

200
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,910
咋回事啊
What? What?

201
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,460
你是不是应该来帮我一起装修
You think you could start helping me with the renovations?

202
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,080
为什么
Why?

203
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,540
我需要你帮忙
Honestly, because I need the help.

204
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,960
拜托了  今天帮帮我
Please, just help me for the day, yeah?

205
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,090
来吧
Come on.

206
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,850
- 别闹  - 对不起
\ Very funny. \ Oh, sorry.

207
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,060
不要紧
Yeah, no, that's okay.

208
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,310
阁楼里有一股风钻进来
There is such a draft coming down from that attic.

209
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,780
可能因为墙上被你砸了个大洞
Maybe it's because you just punched a huge hole in the wall.

210
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,610
那是为了把隔热材料放进去
Yeah? No, it's because I need to put some insulation in.

211
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,660
你妈妈的待完成计划
Mom's to\do list.

212
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,120
总是敦促着我去完成  所以
Always after me to get 'er done, so...

213
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,700
是时候动工了
high time I did.

214
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,000
我能试试吗
Can I?

215
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,630
当然可以
Oh, yeah, sure.

216
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,710
好极了
Cool.

217
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,090
把这个戴上  别吸进石膏粉
Put that on. For the plaster dust.

218
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,470
- 还有护目镜  - 谢谢
\ These, too. \ Oh. Thanks.

219
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,390
哇  我能一直看到屋顶
Whoa. I can see all the way up to the top of the house.

220
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,810
- 是吗  - 天哪
\ Yeah? \ It's crazy.

221
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,310
我在想
I was thinking, um,

222
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,820
感恩节的话  我可以烤一只火鸡  搭几道配菜
Thanksgiving I could make a turkey, pick up some sides.

223
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,700
虽然比不上你妈妈做的
Course, it wouldn't, you know... Wouldn't be as good as your mom's, but...

224
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,870
不过  我们可以试试看  做点花样
Um... we could try and make something special out of it.

225
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
行啊
Sure.

226
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,290
你要是能搞定的话
If you think you can handle it.

227
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,420
肯定可以  只要你帮我一把
Well, if you give me a hand, you bet.

228
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,590
好啊  你需要的话  我很乐意的
Yeah. If you want to, I'd... Yeah, I'd like that.

229
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,800
好的  在家里享用感恩节晚餐吧
All right, good. Thanksgiving dinner at home.

230
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
好极了
Great.

231
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,060
你给自己定下什么目标了吗
So, do you, um, have any goals?

232
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,190
比如什么
Like what?

233
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,820
比如  你想做什么工作
What would you like to do for a living,

234
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,070
在没有限制条件下
if you could do anything?

235
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,700
我不知道
I don't know.

236
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,990
也许和旅行有关
Something with travel maybe.

237
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,200
旅行吗
Travel?

238
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,950
想法很有趣
That's interesting considering

239
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,250
每天听着这些噪音生活一定很头疼吧
Must be a real headache living with this in the background every day.

240
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,420
我习惯了
I'm used to it.

241
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,380
我爸爸知道他在做什么
Okay, my dad knows what he's doing.

242
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,220
关于旅行
Um, travel?

243
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,430
你妈妈以前不就是做这个的吗
Isn't that what your mother used to do?

244
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,600
是个旅行代理商  对吗
She was a travel agent?

245
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,180
不  是一名空姐
Flight attendant.

246
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,230
空中的女招待
Waitress in the sky.

247
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,650
她总是这么称呼自己
That's what she used to call it.

248
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,490
我
I am...

249
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,910
我不是来评判你的
I'm not here to judge you,

250
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,910
而且我最不想做的事情就是扰你心烦
and the last thing I want to do is upset you.

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,880
但如果你一直假装你没有问题  我帮不了你
But I can't help if you keep pretending that there are no problems here.

252
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,880
你想要我说什么
What do you want me to say?

253
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,050
在你这个年龄  你妈妈的去世是难以承受的
Your mother's death was a terrible loss to endure at your age.

254
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,260
在时间未到时死去是一回事
It's one thing when a person dies before their time,

255
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,890
但被强行夺走生命是另一回事
but it is another thing for them to be taken.

256
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,270
你根本不知道你在说什么
No, you don't know what you're talking about.

257
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,020
因为你不愿意跟我谈
Only because you won't talk to me.

258
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,060
我只是厌烦不停回答你的问题
Because I'm tired of answering your questions!

259
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,770
别管我了  行吗
Okay? Just leave me alone!

260
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
就算我这么做
Say I did.

261
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,110
就算我不插手  再也不来
Say I left you alone and didn't come back.

262
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,360
然后呢
Then what?

263
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,360
你觉得  你的情况会好转还是变糟糕
I mean, do you think you'd be better or worse?

264
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,450
这一切都关乎信任  金柏莉
This whole thing is about trust, Kimberly.

265
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,290
你必须相信我
You need to trust me.

266
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,040
人们总是为了那些糟糕的事而怪罪自己
People beat themselves up all the time over the most awful things.

267
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,420
那些他们无法掌控的事情
Things that they had no control over.

268
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,010
在经历一场创伤后  责备自己也是很常见的
And it's common after a traumatic experience to blame yourself.

269
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,220
我怎么会责备自己
Why would I do that?

270
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,680
又不是我害死了她
I didn't kill her.

271
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,220
当然不是你
Of course you didn't.

272
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,600
但你得认清发生了什么
But you need to acknowledge what happened.

273
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,940
我能认清
I can acknowledge it.

274
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,650
某个混蛋谋害了我妈妈
Okay, some sick bastard murdered my mother

275
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,530
把她的尸体丢在了一块空地上
and dumped her body in a vacant lot.

276
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,950
我说出来了
There, I said it.

277
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,700
现在呢  我痊愈了吗
Am I cured now?

278
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,330
我觉得你很害怕  因为罪犯还没有被抓住
I think you're afraid because the man who did this was never caught.

279
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,500
或许也是你不愿意离开这座房子的原因
And maybe that's why you don't want to leave.

280
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,620
换做是你  你会吗
Well, would you?

281
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,500
我呆在这里很安全
I'm safe here.

282
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,590
我和爸爸在一起很安全
I'm safe alone with my dad.

283
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,380
他要是出了事怎么办
And what if something happens to him?

284
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,600
你不能永远都呆在这里
You can't stay in here forever.

285
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,930
世界在外面
The world is out there.

286
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,310
你藏在家里  就是让那个杀害你妈妈的人赢了
You hide in here, and you let whoever took your mom away win.

287
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,480
赢
Win?

288
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,650
天哪  你简直描述成了一场比赛
God, you make it sound like a game.

289
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,530
无意间听到了你们的谈话
Couldn't help overhearing the session.

290
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,910
有点争吵  是吧
Got a little heated, huh?

291
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,750
对抗性的治疗方式往往会使患者情绪激动
Well, confrontational forms of therapy tend to get patients worked up.

292
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,040
我已经习惯了
I'm used to it.

293
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,830
她和她妈妈一个脾气
She's got the same fire her mom had.

294
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,340
金柏莉的进展不是很好  托姆斯先生
Kimberly's, uh, not making very good progress, Mr. Tooms.

295
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,130
她只是需要再多和你聊聊
She just needs to spend more time with you.

296
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,810
金柏莉有没有对你显示出身体上的攻击
Has Kimberly ever displayed physical aggression toward you?

297
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,690
或是对她自己
Or herself?

298
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,100
没有  她不会这么做的
No. She wouldn't do that.

299
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,520
她对你的妻子发过火吗
Was she ever angry with your wife?

300
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,480
罗斯吗  没有
With Rose? No!

301
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,990
从来没有  只是正常母女间会有的争吵罢了
Never. I mean, no more than the usual mother/daughter spat.

302
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,360
怎么了
Why?

303
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,040
我只是想更全面地了解金伯莉
Well, I'm just trying to get a better picture of Kimberly and her mental state

304
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,790
和导致她焦虑的心理状态
leading to the onset of the anxiety.

305
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,620
不  她不可能伤害别人的
No, she couldn't... couldn't hurt anybody.

306
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,880
尤其不会故意伤害她妈妈
Especially not her mother. Not on purpose.

307
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,590
亨利  当你和家人在一起时
You know, Henry, it's easy to miss things

308
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,090
很容易忽略一些细节
when you're emotionally enrolled with a family member.

309
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,300
- 老生常谈了  - 好吧  医生
\ It's cliché. \ Yeah, okay, Doc.

310
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,890
- 家长往往是最后一个知情的  - 嗯
\ But parents are often the last to know. \ Yeah.

311
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,350
留意她的极端行为
So, keep an eye out for extreme behaviors.

312
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,350
在这个阶段  可能是药物治疗的迹象
Now, it could be a sign of the medication,

313
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,230
也可能是病情加重的迹象
but it could be a sign of a deeper pathology.

314
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,900
极端行为
Extreme behaviors?

315
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,360
金伯莉容易生气
Well, Kimberly's angry,

316
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,280
怒火会通过很多方式表现出来
and anger can manifest itself in many ways.

317
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,860
比如什么
Like what?

318
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,700
妄想症  强迫症  偏执症
Delusional, obsessive, paranoid.

319
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,280
听着  像她这样花很多时间独处
Look, spending as much time as she does alone,

320
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,120
逃避认清现实
refusing to acknowledge what happened to her\\

321
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,710
金伯莉经历太多糟糕的事了
No. Look, um, Kimberly's been through a lot.

322
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,750
她能走出来的  她会的
She'll pull through this. She will.

323
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,670
你也处在悲伤中
You're grieving,

324
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,170
我明白这对你俩来说都不容易
And I know it's not easy for either of you,

325
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,970
但要是金伯莉不直面现实
but if Kimberly doesn't confront what happened,

326
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,890
这座房子就会从避难所变成牢房
this house will turn from a sanctuary into a cell.

327
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,970
这是她家
This is her home.

328
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,180
不是监狱
It's not a prison.

329
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,470
亨利  拜托
Henry, please.

330
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,180
你不能过分溺爱她  你应该劝她多出门
You're coddling her when you should be coaxing her out,

331
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,440
打破她待在家里的怪圈
breaking the cycle that's keeping her inside.

332
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,560
我的女儿  我知道该怎么抚养
I know how to raise my own daughter.

333
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,570
下周见
I'll see you next week.

334
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,200
请你想想我说的话
Please, just, um, think about what I said.

335
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,630
对不起
Sorry.

336
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,840
怎么了
For what?

337
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,750
我搞砸了
For being a bitch.

338
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,460
宝贝  你尽力了  不是吗
Oh honey. You're doing the best you can, all right?

339
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,470
- 嗯  - 你还好吧
\ Yeah. \ You okay?

340
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,510
还好
Well, yeah.

341
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,430
我去趟奥马利那边  和他们喝点啤酒
I'm gonna head down to O'Malley's, get a beer with the guys.

342
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,510
好的
Okay.

343
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,470
我回来以后  我们可以看部电影  大口吃冰淇淋
When I get back, we can watch a movie, pig out on ice cream.

344
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,140
- 好的  - 嗯  听话
\ Great. \ All right. Be good.

345
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,060
好  你也是
Yeah. You, too.

346
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,360
一名来自加利福尼亚恩西诺的女孩至今下落不明
A teenager from Encino, California, is still missing

347
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,700
经过一周的搜查  没有发现任何新的线索或证人
after a one\week search has failed to turn up any new leads or witnesses.

348
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,910
警方怀疑索菲・泰勒在恩西诺的家附近被绑架
Police suspect Sophie Taylor was abducted near her Encino home.

349
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,950
在今天早上的新闻发布会上
At a press conference earlier this morning,

350
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,870
她的父母呼吁提供
her parents made an appeal for information

351
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,630
有关他们女儿失踪的消息
concerning their daughter's disappearance.

352
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,630
我想让大家知道
I just want everyone to know

353
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,680
我的女儿是多么的善良  美好
what a beautiful, kind, and wonderful person my daughter is.

354
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,300
苏菲  如果你正在看
If you're watching this, Sophie,

355
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,260
我们非常爱你
we love you very much.

356
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,470
我们只想确保你的安全
We just want to know that you're okay

357
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,930
尽快回家
and for you to come home.

358
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,640
我们呼吁所有能提供
We're appealing to anyone who knows any information

359
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,390
苏菲・泰勒下落的人
regarding Sophie Taylor's whereabouts

360
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,650
立即拨打这个电话
to contact this number immediately.

361
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,900
我的天
Oh, my God.

362
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
国内新闻  总统不断攻击穷忙族
In national news, the President is once again under fire

363
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,370
使他再次遭到舆论热议
for his continual attack on the working poor, while the\\

364
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,340
该死
Shit.

365
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,230
你还没睡吗  我以为你早就睡了
Oh, you're still up. I thought you'd be in bed by now.

366
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,110
说好有电影之夜的呢
Oh, I thought we had movie night.

367
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,440
比计划中花的时间更久了些
Yeah, it just took a little longer than I planned.

368
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,570
搭把手吗
Lend a hand?

369
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,740
好的
Oh, sure.

370
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,030
外面很冷吗
Oh. Is it cold outside?

371
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,830
不  货车里有点冷  你刚在做什么
Cold? No, well, it's a little chilly in the van. What have you been up to?

372
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,620
就看看电视
Um, just watching TV.

373
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,580
有什么好玩的吗
Anything good?

374
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,250
没什么
No, nothing really.

375
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,880
就随便上上网
Surfing mostly.

376
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,380
你在虚张声势  毕格罗先生
You're bluffing, Mr. Bigelow.

377
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,380
我不知道你想要什么  但你试图耍我
I don't know what you're after, but you're trying to trick me.

378
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,800
菲利普斯太太  你能否告诉我
Mrs. Phillips, can you tell me...

379
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,680
你不饿吗
You're not hungry?

380
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,930
可能只是没什么胃口
Uh, just lost my appetite, I guess.

381
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,770
冰淇淋吗
For ice cream?

382
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,230
我来收拾一下吧
Well, I'll clean up.

383
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
- 该死  - 别紧张
\ Shit! \ Easy there, jumpy.

384
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,610
对不起
Sorry.

385
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,860
没事
No, it's all right.

386
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,860
- 我可以收拾干净  - 给我吧
\ No, I can clean it up. \ Let me get it.

387
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,780
- 小心点  - 糟糕
\ Careful. \ Ow, shit.

388
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,780
告诉你小心点了
Damn, I told you to be careful.

389
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,830
给我看看
Come on, let me see.

390
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,080
- 手伸过来  - 没事的
\ Let me see. \ It's fine.

391
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
真没事
It's fine.

392
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,290
给我看看
Let me see.

393
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,040
你要是没什么想隐瞒的  最好开口讲吧
If you got nothing to hide, you better start talking.

394
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,540
- 或者也许你有罪  - 不
\ Or maybe you are guilty! \ No!

395
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,300
伤口不太深  我们去冲洗干净
No, it's not too deep, but, yeah, we should definitely wash up.

396
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
起来
Come on.

397
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,180
行了
Yeah. Okay.

398
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,720
好了
Here you go.

399
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,900
你身上蹭到我的血了
I got blood on you.

400
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,270
没关系
I don't mind.

401
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,690
好了
There we go.

402
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,240
这是我起码能做的
Yeah, that's the least I can do.

403
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,700
谢谢
Thanks.

404
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,730
嘿  老爸
Hey, Dad?

405
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,730
嘿  感恩节快乐  亲爱的
Hey, happy Thanksgiving, sweetheart.

406
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,860
是啊
Yeah.

407
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,570
呃  我今天得出去一下
Uh, I have to go out for a bit today.

408
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,490
我把火鸡的烹饪方法给你写下来了
I left instructions for the turkey.

409
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,570
你只需要把它烤一整天  偶尔涂点酱料就行
I think you just kind of bake it all day, baste every once in a while.

410
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,910
你能做得到吗
Can you handle that for us?

411
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,740
可以啊  呃
Uh, yeah, sure, um...

412
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,200
你是从哪儿给我买的生日礼物啊
Hey, where did you get my birthday present?

413
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,670
就是瓦利镇上一个珠宝店里  咋了
At a jewelry shop in the Valley. Why?

414
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,330
你确定这不是二手的吗
Are you sure it's not second\hand?

415
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,500
什么
What?

416
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,800
这个都生锈了  看见没
Well, it's tarnished. See?

417
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,340
- 生锈了  - 是的
\Tarnished? \Yeah.

418
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,140
哦  我买的时候都没看到
Oh. Didn't see that when I bought it,

419
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,390
但是  我猜这应该是制作的时候弄得
but, um, it's a manufacturing flaw, I suppose.

420
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,850
这也是难免的
It happens.

421
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,020
你可以去换一个新的吗
So then maybe you can exchange it for a new one?

422
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,690
这是他们唯一的存货了  抱歉  金
It's the only one they had in stock. Sorry, Kim.

423
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,820
给  这是你的早餐
Here, eat your breakfast.

424
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,150
趁热赶紧吃
Before it gets cold.

425
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,490
谢谢
Thanks.

426
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,750
呃
Ugh!

427
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,670
恶心死了
Disgusting.

428
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,380
啊
Aah!

429
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,140
糟了
Oh, shit.

430
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,370
这是  血吗
Is that... blood?

431
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,630
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

432
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,090
喂  简姨妈  我是金柏莉
Hey, Aunty Jane? It's Kimberly.

433
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,640
我知道今天是假期
I know it's the holidays,

434
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,430
但是  我真的真的需要到你那儿待几天
but I really, really have to stay with you for a few days.

435
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,430
呃  等见面的时候我再给你详细解释一下
Um, I'll explain more when I see you.

436
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,350
收到请给我回个电话  拜拜
Just give me a call back. Okay, bye.

437
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,330
好了  加油  金伯莉
Okay, come on, Kimberly.

438
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,510
加油  加油  加油
Come on, come on, come on.

439
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,720
你不能待着这里  金
You can't stay here, Kim.

440
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,710
好了
Okay.

441
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,600
那只是太阳而已
It's just the sun.

442
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,690
那只是几只鸟
That's just some birds.

443
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,820
你会没事的
You're gonna be okay.

444
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,530
会没事的
Gonna be okay.

445
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,990
你会
You're gonna be\\

446
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,200
我回家啦
I'm home!

447
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,450
我买到了最后一块南瓜饼
Think I found the last pumpkin pie.

448
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,450
火鸡烤的怎么样啊  你都没摆桌
How'd it go with the turkey today? You didn't even set the ta\\

449
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,580
这是什么  老爸
What is this, Dad?

450
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,920
你不需要担心这些
They're nothing for you to worry about.

451
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,960
这是你偷来的吗
Did you steal them?

452
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,340
你跑到阁楼上去干嘛
What were you even doing in the attic?

453
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,550
我只是想看一下你在做什么
I just wanted to see what you've been doing.

454
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,970
看什么  我一直在装修房子
See what? I've been working on the house.

455
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,770
说真的  金  我觉得你必须停止胡思乱想了
Honestly, Kim, I think you have to stop with these wild assumptions.

456
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,810
我能听到你在上面走动
I can hear you moving around up there.

457
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,430
晚上的时候
At night.

458
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,270
你就是在干这个吗
Is this what you've been doing?

459
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,980
藏这些东西
Hiding these?

460
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,650
老爸
Dad!

461
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,280
我也是有自己的私人物品的  金
I'm allowed to have my own private things, Kim.

462
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,410
但你为什么要这样藏着
But why would you hide them like that?

463
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,990
- 该死的  金  火鸡都要干了  - 老爸
\Damn it, Kim! It's gonna be dry! \Dad?

464
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,490
看见没  这就是为什么我和你妈从来不让你养猫
See, this is why your mother and I never got you a cat.

465
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,080
你为什么要把这些藏到妈妈旧的工作包里呢
Why would you hide them in Mom's old work bag?

466
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,960
我很想你妈妈  金
I miss your mom, Kim.

467
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,670
和你一样  我想要藏起这种思念
Same as you. I try to hide it,

468
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,300
但有时候  我需要花些时间
but sometimes I just need to spend some time alone

469
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,340
和她留下的东西单独待着
with the few remaining pieces that she left behind.

470
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,760
一些只属于我的东西  只属于我
Pieces that are mine. Just mine.

471
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,890
金
Kim?

472
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,430
听着  亲爱的  很抱歉让你这么难过
Look sweetheart, I'm sorry if it upset you,

473
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,060
但老爸不是完人
but Dad's not perfect.

474
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,230
这上面有血
There's blood on this.

475
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,650
那是油漆
That's paint.

476
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,820
你不接电话吗
You're not gonna answer that?

477
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,410
不  现在先不接
No, not right now.

478
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,200
你吃药了吗
Are you taking your meds?

479
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,410
怎么了
What?

480
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,500
桑德斯医生说过药可能有副作用
Well, Dr. Saunders said there might be side effects\\

481
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,710
行为不稳定  偏执
erratic behavior, paranoia.

482
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,550
这不是药的原因  别把矛头指向我
It's not the med\\ Don't turn this around on me!

483
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,260
金  我得跟你说实话  你又开始胡思乱想了
Kim, I gotta be honest with you. You're acting paranoid again.

484
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,760
- 毫无根据的  真的什么事都没有  - 别撒谎了
\Over nothing. Really nothing! \Just stop lying!

485
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,010
别用这种语气和我说话  我是你爸爸
Don't take that tone with me! I am still your father!

486
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,220
你是不是杀了她
Did you kill her?

487
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,600
什么  杀了谁
What?! Who?

488
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,180
索菲・泰勒
Sophie Taylor.

489
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,400
这是她的项链  对不对
This is her necklace, isn't it?

490
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,980
是不是
Well, isn't it?!

491
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,030
拜托了  老爸  给我说实话
Come on, Dad, the truth.

492
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,280
不说实话是吧  行
Not gonna tell the truth? Fine.

493
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,950
项链一模一样
They're the same.

494
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,870
同样的标记
Same mark.

495
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,250
是的  我问过商店了
Yeah, I talked to the store.

496
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,460
他们说这是一种款式
Yeah, but they said it's a style.

497
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,960
他们说  这叫做思苦项链
Distressed, they called it.

498
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,590
好吧
Okay.

499
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,800
那这些呢
Well, what about these?

500
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,970
这都是谁的东西
Who did they belong to?

501
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,220
这是你妈妈的
They belonged to your mother.

502
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,810
她这些年从飞机上捡到的东西
Pieces she picked up from flights over the years.

503
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,530
当然了  她应该还到失物招领处的  但是
She should've turned them in to lost and found or whatever, of course, but...

504
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,740
你知道的  你妈妈并不完美
you know, your mom was not perfect.

505
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,830
我也不完美
I'm not perfect.

506
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,910
你也不完美
You're not perfect.

507
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,910
我一直没有告诉你  是怕你
I didn't want to tell you in case you...

508
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,370
会崩溃
freaked out.

509
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,340
但这并不能解释
But that doesn't explain\\

510
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,170
你现在越来越像她了  你知道吗
You're turning into her, do you know that?

511
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,430
直到最后都那么神经质  那么偏执
Neurotic and paranoid until the end.

512
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,430
是你杀了她吗
Did you kill her?

513
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,390
不是  金
No, Kim.

514
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,730
我的天哪  你是不是杀了妈妈
Oh, my God, did you kill Mom?

515
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,570
杀死你妈妈的人
The person who killed your mother

516
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,400
还在逍遥法外
is still out there.

517
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,490
或者一直以来
Or he's been here with me

518
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,540
他一直就在我身边
the whole time.

519
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,250
金  拜托了
Kim, come on, now!

520
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,750
金  等等
Kim, wait.

521
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,380
- 金  - 不
\Kim. \No.

522
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,680
- 金  啊  - 不
\Kim? Ah! \No.

523
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,390
金  开门  快点  这么做太蠢了
Kim, open up. Come on now. This is silly.

524
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,970
我没做错什么
I didn't do anything wrong.

525
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,060
金伯莉  我爱你
Kimberly? I love you.

526
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,270
快开门
Now open up.

527
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,560
不管你在里面做什么  不要伤害你自己  亲爱的
Whatever you're doing in there, just don't hurt yourself, sweetheart.

528
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,020
金伯莉
Kimberly?!

529
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,150
我叫你把门打开
I said open this damn door!

530
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,240
打开这该死的门
Open the damn door!

531
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
好吧
All right.

532
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,290
我数三下  然后我就进去了
I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm coming in.

533
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,580

我要报警了
I'm calling the police!

537
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,020
这里是911紧急呼救  请问您有什么需要
911 Emergency. How may I direct your call?

538
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,600

544
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,200
你的紧急情况是什么性质的呢
What's the nature of your emergency?

545
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,160
你说你爸爸想进到你房间里去
You said your dad is trying to get into your room?

546
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,540
- 是的  我觉得他弄伤了别人  - 他弄伤了谁
\Yeah, I think he's hurt someone. \Who has he hurt?

547
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,790
我不知道  你能派人过来救我吗

我现在派一个警察到你家去
I'm dispatching a police unit to your address now.

有的  我已经锁上了

- 金伯莉  别挂电话  - 离门远点  亲爱的
\Kimberly, stay on the line. \Stand back from the door, sweetheart.

555
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,560
稍等一下
Just a second!

556
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,600

Okay?

563
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,590
你冷静下来了吗
Are you calm now?

564
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,510
我在问你问题呢  金  你现在冷静了吗
I asked you a question, Kim! Are you calm now?!

565
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,730
我们能不能理智又安静地谈谈呢  能吗
Can we please just talk about this quietly and sensibly? Can we do that?

566
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,900
我最近压力很大  仅此而已
It's just that I've been under a lot of stress lately. That's all.

567
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,200
每个人都会这样的
This just happens to everybody.

568
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,910
你刚给谁打电话了
Who did you call?

569
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,450
谁也没打
No one.

570
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,050
哦  亲爱的
Oh, sweetheart.

571
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,930
我真希望你没这么做
I really wish you hadn't done that.

572
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,930
没事  我们会解决好这件事的
It's okay. We'll sort this whole mess out.

573
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,440
那么  我们现在该怎么做呢
So, what are we gonna do now?

574
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,940
警察正在来的路上  你需要好好解释一下
Police are on their way, so you're gonna have a lot of explaining to do.

575
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,320
你也一样
So do you.

576
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,620
如果我不在的话  谁来照顾你呢
So, who's gonna take care of you when I'm not around?

577
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,830
你想过这一点吗
Did you think of that?

578
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,120
不  没有我  你都无家可归
No, without me, there's no roof over your head.

579
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,670
家  我得指出这一点
A roof, which I'd like to point out,

580
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,040
你太害怕了  都不敢从家里出去
that you're too afraid to get out from under anyway.

581
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,550
他们可能会把你送到疯人院里去
Probably just wind up in a damn nut house.

582
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,130
把你关在橡胶房间里  到处约束着你
Rubber rooms and straightjackets for you.

583
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,630
需要帮助的人是你
You're the one who needs help.

584
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,010
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

585
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,350
你表现的很偏执  胡思乱想
You're acting paranoid. Delusional.

586
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,430
我没有
That's not true.

587
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,970
好了  你听我说
All right, you listen to me.

588
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,570
你确定吗
Are you sure?

589
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,610
亲爱的  你从出生就和我待在一起
Sweetheart, you've known me your whole life.

590
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,860
我一直在陪着你
I've always been there for you.

591
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,330
我从来没有打过你
I never hit you.

592
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,200
也没有伤害过你
I never hurt you.

593
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,540
我几乎都没大声和你说过话
Barely even raise my voice.

594
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,840
有过吗
Have I?

595
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,260
我有吗
Well, have I?

596
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,050
因为我爱你  金柏莉  你是我的一切
Because I love you, Kimberly. You mean everything to me.

597
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,140
但是这首饰呢
But what about the jewelry?

598
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,100
我是说  我不信是妈妈的
I mean, I just don't believe it was Mom's.

599
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,770
你信不信没关系
Doesn't matter what you believe.

600
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,020
我很抱歉你找到了它
I'm sorry you found it.

601
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,110
我真的很抱歉
I really am.

602
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,150
这不容易
It hasn't been easy.

603
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,900
你妈妈遇到了糟糕的事情
What happened to your mother is an awful thing,

604
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,990
不过你不能怪在我身上
but you can't blame me for that.

605
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,280
我知道你恨我  我懂
I know you hate me, I get it.

606
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,580
我最近一直很疏远
I have been somewhat remote lately.

607
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,960
但我脑海里的事情太多了
But I've had so much on my mind.

608
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,510
我只希望你妈妈不在的第一个感恩节能够
I just wanted this first Thanksgiving without your mother to be...

609
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,510
我不知道
I don't know, somehow...

610
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,050
对你来说还行
okay for you.

611
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,890
对我们来说
For us.

612
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,470
但我是个杀人犯吗
But am I guilty of being a murderer?

613
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,440
你怎么能那么想
How can you even think that?

614
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,610
所以当警察们来的时候
So when those police officers show up,

615
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,700
你需要确定这一点
you need to be certain of that.

616
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,910
你心里要知道
You need to know in here,

617
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,040
脑海里也要知道
and you need to know in here.

618
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,080
确定无疑
Without any doubt.

619
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:35,550
否则  你会毁了我们家剩下的一切
Otherwise, you'd destroy what's left of our family.

620
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,090
所以  现在
So, now

621
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,300
你觉得你百分百确定
do you feel that you're one hundred percent positive

622
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,510
我是你觉得我是的那个人吗
that I am who you think I am?

623
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,730
好的
Good.

624
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:55,820
那么警察们来的时候  不要说任何话
Then when the police officers do show up, don't say anything.

625
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,030
是药物和现状扰乱了你的思维
It's the medication and your condition that's warping your thinking.

626
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,910
他们会理解的
They'll understand.

627
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,750
晚上好  先生
Evening, sir.

628
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,050
我是福斯特警官  这是班克斯警官  洛杉矶警察局
I'm Officer Foster, this is Officer Banks, LAPD.

629
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,090
晚上好
Evening.

630
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,380
我们半小时前收到此地址的报警电话
We received a 911 call from this address in the last half hour.

631
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,430
一位年轻女士说她遇到了危险
A young woman said she was in distress.

632
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,970
是的  那是我的女儿
Yeah, that would be my daughter.

633
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,680
- 你是房子的主人吗  - 是的
\Are you the homeowner? \Yes.

634
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,760
你的名字
And your name?

635
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,810
亨利・托姆斯
Henry Tooms.

636
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,730
托姆斯先生  基于这个电话
Mr. Tooms, on the basis of this call,

637
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,350
我们有正当理由进入你的房子展开搜查
we have just cause to enter your property to conduct a search

638
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,520
并且访问你和你的女儿  你对此有疑问吗
and to interview both you and your daughter. Do you have a problem with this?

639
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,320
没有  请  进来吧
No, please, come in.

640
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,110
不好意思一团糟
Apologies for the mess.

641
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:44,990
装修
Renovations.

642
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,700
你是金柏莉吗  是你打了报警电话吗
Are you Kimberly? Did you make the 9\1\1 call?

643
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
- 是的  - 这有点不好意思  事实上
\Yeah. \It's a bit embarrassing, actually.

644
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,460
金姆只是反应过度了
Kim just overreacted.

645
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,170
托姆斯先生  我们需要你去房间外待一会
Mr. Tooms, we're gonna need you to step outside the room for a minute.

646
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,250
为什么
Why?

647
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,920
我会跟金柏莉单独交谈  我的伙伴  她会
I'm gonna talk to Kimberly alone, and my partner, she's gonna take

648
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,390
- 在厨房录你的口供  - 好的
\your statement in the kitchen there. \All right.

649
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,350
你先
After you.

650
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,060
我是班克斯警官
I'm Officer Banks.

651
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,850
我能给你拿点什么吗
Can I get you anything?

652
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,560
不用
No.

653
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,400
你受伤了吗
Are you injured?

654
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,520
没有
No.

655
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,030
你爸爸在装修房子吗
So your dad's renovating, huh?

656
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,030
是的
Oh. Um, yeah.

657
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,530
已经有一段时间了
It's been taking a while.

658
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,200
- 我能  - 当然
\May I? \Sure.

659
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,040
- 不  不  - 抱歉
\Ooh! No, no. \Sorry.

660
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,620
不  不  我没事  这是我的
No, no, I got it. It's mine.

661
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,460
金柏莉  我需要你告诉我今晚这儿发生了什么
Kimberly, I'm gonna need you to tell me what happened here tonight.

662
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,300
觉得你能为我这么做吗
Think you can do that for me?

663
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,340
假期里你肯定会收到很多假的报警电话
You must get a lot of bogus domestic calls at the holidays.

664
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,050
你为什么这么说
What makes you say that?

665
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,640
我只是说  家人们在一起  脾气暴发
Well, I just mean, families together, tempers flare.

666
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,850
接下来  乔叔叔用叉子之类的东西伤了露表弟
Next thing you know, Uncle Joe stabs Cousin Lou with a fork kinda thing.

667
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,560
常常这样
It happens.

668
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:05,360
金柏莉  你爸爸现在不在这儿  这儿只有你和我
Kimberly, your dad's not here right now. It's just you and me.

669
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,660
你打电话是有原因的  告诉我  什么让你拿起了电话
You made the call for a reason. Just tell me what\\ what made you pick up the phone.

670
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,870
没什么
Nothing.

671
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,960
他是对的  我反应过度了
He's right. I overreacted.

672
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,370
所以  你女儿很容易做类似的事吗
So, your daughter's prone to this kind of behavior?

673
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,090
不  她
No, she's...

674
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,920
她是个非常好的姑娘  只是这一年比较艰难
She's such a good girl. It's just been a tough year.

675
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,430
去年她妈妈被谋杀了
Her mother was murdered last year.

676
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,680
- 罗斯・托姆斯  - 是的
\Rose Tooms? \Yeah.

677
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,600
节哀
Sorry for your loss.

678
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,940
嗯  警察还没有找到凶手
Yeah, well, the cops haven't found the guy yet.

679
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,860
所以你是在暗示这是她打电话的原因
So you're suggesting this is the reason she made that call?

680
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,940
警官  这件事发生之后我女儿就封闭了自己
Officer, my daughter's been a shut\in since this happened.

681
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,610
她甚至不能离开房子
She can't even leave the house.

682
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,740
前门一开她就会非常惊恐
She'll have a panic attack when the front door opens.

683
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,700
我打开窗户她就会头晕
I can't unlatch a window without her getting dizzy.

684
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,530
她在服药
She's taking this medication for, uh...

685
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,990
广场恐惧症
Agoraphobia?

686
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,290
好吧
Yep.

687
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:59,250
- 你在接受治疗吗  - 我爸爸给我找了个心理医生
\Are you seeking treatment for that? \My dad got me a therapist.

688
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,790
我们在家里治疗
We have sessions at home.

689
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,380
能告诉我你医生的名字吗
Can you tell me the name of your doctor?

690
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,590
海伦・桑德斯医生
Dr. Helen Saunders.

691
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,090
我跟她联系可以吗
And would it be okay with you if I contacted her?

692
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,590
我没能经常在她身边
I haven't been around as much.

693
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,260
工作  很  疯狂
And work's been, like, crazy.

694
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,850
试着支撑我们俩
Trying to support the both of us.

695
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,980
她只是孤独和愤怒
Uh, she's just lonely and angry.

696
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,730
我之前责备过她  她跑上楼了
I told her off earlier, she ran upstairs.

697
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,820
青少年
Teenagers.

698
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,660
你为什么责备她
Why'd you tell her off?

699
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,200
只是房子  东西到处都是  你知道吗
Well, the house is just\\ it's all over the place right now, you know?

700
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,160
好吧
All right.

701
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,210
她去了阁楼  我告诉过她  我不知道
She went up to the attic, and I told her\\ Well, I don't know.

702
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,250
她上去看她妈妈的旧东西
She was up there to see some of her mom's old stuff,

703
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,540
所以  你知道的
so, like, you know.

704
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,630
但她几乎摔断了脖子  所以我
But she practically broke her neck, so I got\\

705
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,130
我  我没控制住
I just\\ I lost it,

706
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,420
她跑去了她的房间  不肯出来
so she ran to her room, wouldn't come out.

707
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,800
你知道的  我声音大了些
You know, I raised my voice with her a bit.

708
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,180
我觉得她不适应
I don't think she was used to it.

709
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
她给你们打电话了
She called you guys.

710
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,440
托姆斯先生  家庭暴力是很严重的问题
Mr. Tooms, domestic abuse is a serious issue.

711
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,860
我们接到很多这类的电话
We get a lot of calls on it.

712
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,070
所以我必须问
So I have to ask...

713
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,400
你之前打过她吗
have you ever hit her before?

714
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,280
不  从没有
No. Never.

715
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,320
他从没有对你举手要打你吗
He's never raised his hand to you in any way?

716
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,540
不  我只是生气
No. I was just mad.

717
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,450
这  我不该说任何事
This is\\ I shouldn't have said anything.

718
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,540
我不
I don't\\

719
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,170
我不想给他惹麻烦
I don't want him to get in any trouble.

720
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,290
我明白  他是你爸爸
I understand that. He's your dad.

721
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,300
他  他没有做过任何错事
He\\ He hasn't done anything wrong.

722
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,800
你确定没有其他想告诉我的事吗
Are you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me?

723
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,560
是的  我确定
Yeah, I'm sure.

724
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,980
好吧  我想我们结束了
Okay then, I think we're done here.

725
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,730
是的  像是这样
Yeah, it appears so.

726
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,480
根据你爸爸说的  这都是些误会
According to your dad, this was all some sort of misunderstanding.

727
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,530
- 是这样的吗  - 对不起
\Is that correct? \I'm sorry.

728
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:53,490
这样的话  我得提醒你不要浪费警察的时间
In that case, I'm gonna have to caution you against wasting police time.

729
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,030
我们应该在真正紧急的情况下接到电话
We're only to be called in cases of genuine emergencies.

730
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,790
你明白吗
Do you understand?

731
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,080
是的  抱歉
Yes, I'm sorry.

732
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,460
好吧  如果没有别的
All right, if there's nothing else...

733
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,170
好的  我们出去了
Okay, then we'll head out.

734
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,840
爱你
Love you.

735
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,800
感谢你们的到来
Thanks for coming just the same.

736
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,840
- 晚安  - 谢谢
\ You have a good night. \Thank you.

737
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,390
等等
Hey, hold on one second.

738
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,640
听着  如果你想谈谈
Hey, listen, if there's anything that you want to talk about

739
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:25,440
任何你现在不想谈的事  直接给我打电话  好吗
that you feel like you can't talk about here, call me direct, okay?

740
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,400
- 好的  - 任何事
\ Okay. \Anything at all.

741
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,320
谢谢
Thanks.

742
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,610
晚安  再次感谢
Night. Thanks again.

743
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,950
节日快乐
Happy holidays.

744
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,330
去床上吧  明早我会修好你的门
Go to bed. I'll fix your door in the morning.

745
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,820
你去过我的房间
You were in my room.

746
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,820
如果我翻你的东西你会是什么感觉
How would you feel if I went through your personal things?

747
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,570
我该失望吗
Should I be disappointed?

748
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,700
生气
Angry?

749
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,790
或者因为没有把你养好而对自己愤怒
Or mad at myself for not bringing you up right?

750
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,460
我伤了自己
I hurt myself.

751
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,170
给我
Give me that.

752
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,880
为什么
Why?

753
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,920
因为它是我的
Because it's mine.

754
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,550
这不是你的收藏品
This wasn't in your collection.

755
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,680
- 给我  - 你知道什么很奇怪吗
\Just give it to me. \ You know what's weird?

756
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,890
什么
What?

757
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,850
那些失踪的女孩
All those girls that went missing?

758
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,520
她们看起来都差不多
They all kinda look the same.

759
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,940
她们都很像妈妈
They kinda look like Mom.

760
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,940
整个事情都失控了
This whole thing's getting out of hand.

761
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,110
我爱你  我爱你的妈妈  金姆
I love you, and I loved your mom, Kim.

762
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,660
我们的家  它曾是  现在也是我最重要的
Our family, it was and is the most important thing to me.

763
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,750
你妈妈失踪的那个晚上  我们吵架了
The night your mom disappeared, we fought.

764
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,670
罗斯临时改变了行程  再一次
Rose had a last\minute schedule change. Again.

765
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,590
而我对此很疲惫
And I was tired of it.

766
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,590
我厌倦了不在第一位
I was tired of not being first.

767
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,880
你和我不在第一位
Of you and me not being first.

768
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,880
我为那次吵架的每一个字后悔吗
Do I regret every word of that fight?

769
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,720
是的  每天的分分秒秒
Yes! Every minute, every second of every day.

770
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,810
但是警察发现你妈妈尸体的时候
But when the cops found your mom's body,

771
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:16,730
拜托  你要相信我  我的心永远碎了
please, you gotta believe me, my heart broke forever.

772
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:20,190
我希望我能拿走这些话和愤怒
I wish I could take those words and take the anger out of them

773
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:24,740
换上理解和耐心
and replace it with compassion and patience.

774
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,780
这就是我现在做的
Which is what I'm doing now.

775
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,030
你觉得我想失去你吗
Do you think I wanna lose you?

776
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:35,160
你觉得我会允许桑德斯医生让你坦白吗
Do you think I'm gonna let Dr. Saunders have you committed?

777
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,330
金柏莉  不
Kimberly, no!

778
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,790
我们是我的一切
All I have is us!

779
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,170
金姆  拜托  把它给我
Kim, please, please just give it to me,

780
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,760
去睡觉吧  明早一切都会变好的
go to sleep, and everything will be better in the morning.

781
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,220
金柏莉
Kimberly.

782
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,430
金姆
Kim.

783
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,810
- 把那个拿开  - 多少
\Put that away! \How many?

784
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,270
你会伤到你自己的
You're gonna hurt yourself.

785
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:01,690
多少
How many?

786
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:05,610
这就是桑德斯医生警告我的
This is exactly what Dr. Saunders warned me about.

787
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,450
她说你的药可能会引起攻击性
She said your medication might trigger aggression.

788
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,030
她让我注意这个  但我没听
She told me to look for this, and I didn't listen.

789
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,950
如果你伤到自己  如果你伤了我  你会被关起来
If you hurt yourself, if you hurt me, you'll be locked up.

790
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,200
站住别动  拜托
Stay where you are, please.

791
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,830
我不是那晚唯一和她吵架的人
I wasn't the only one who fought with her that night!

792
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,670
你不记得了  是吗
You don't remember that, do you?

793
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:24,300
你不记得那晚你多生她的气
You don't remember how angry you were at her that night.

794
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,090
- 那不是真的  - 不是吗
\That's not true. \It's not?

795
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,050
- 才不是这样  - 你确定吗
\That's not true. \Are you sure?

796
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:30,680
- 走开  - 金  不是你想的那样
\Go! Leave! \ Kim, it's not what you think!

797
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,470
- 你就相信我一次吧  - 相信你
\Just trust me for once! \Trust you?

798
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,100
我为什么要相信一个背叛我爸爸的人呢
Why would I trust someone who's cheating on my dad?

799
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,770
- 我没有  - 你抛弃了他  你抛弃了我
\ I'm not! \You leave him. You leave me.

800
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,640
你抛弃了我们  那就离开吧
You leave us! Leave!

801
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,270
- 以后也别回来了  - 金
\And don't bother coming back here! \Kim!

802
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,860
金伯莉  把刀子给我  以免发生你没法挽回的事情
Kimberly, just give me the knife before something happens you can't take back.

803
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:49,990
金伯莉
Kimberly.

804
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,570
- 放下刀子  - 我让你离我远点
\Put that down. \I said stay away from me.

805
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,580
走开
Stay back!

806
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,780
不
No.

807
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,450
不  不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

808
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:35,990
住手  不  不  不
Stop. No, no, no!

809
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,710
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

810
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,110
爸爸
Dad?

811
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,280
爸爸  你在外面吗
Dad?! Are you there?!

812
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,580
你在吗
Hello?!

813
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,660
爸爸
Dad.

814
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,410
爸爸  求你进来吧
Dad? Please come in.

815
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,420
不要这样对我
Don't do this to me!

816
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,380
嘿
Hey!

817
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,460
喂
Hey!

818
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,420
我对你与其说是愤怒  不如说是失望
It's more disappointment than anger.

819
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,130
你现在让我别无选择  金
You leave me no choice here, Kim.

820
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,050
你已经失去控制力了
You're out of control.

821
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,680
这不是永久的
This isn't permanent.

822
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,100
这也不是对你的惩罚
It's not punishment.

823
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,890
我甚至给你留了一些晚餐
I even left you some of the dinner,

824
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,730
我们应该吃的节日晚餐
the holiday dinner we were supposed to have,

825
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,980
包括那块馅饼
including the pie,

826
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,860
实际上  你没有资格吃的
which, frankly, you don't deserve.

827
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,860
这些应该能暂时帮你度过难关
That should tide you over for now.

828
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,280
在你镇定下来之前  你的手机和电脑都要没收了
Your phone and your laptop are off\limits until you settle down.

829
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,490
亲爱的  我需要出去一下
Honey, I need to go out for a little bit,

830
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,080
等我回来我们再继续说这件事
so we'll finish talking about this when I get back.

831
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
爸爸
Dad?

832
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,460
爸爸
Dad?!

833
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,470
喂  喂
Hey! Hey!

834
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,350
喂
Hey!

835
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:27,770
喂  你不能这样
Hey! You can't do this!

836
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,730
你不能这样
You can't do this!

837
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,450
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

838
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,390
妈的  妈的
Fuck. Fuck!

839
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,260
妈的
Fuck.

840
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,110
太棒了
Yes.

841
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,540
金伯莉
Kimberly.

842
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,880
你是怎么做到的
How did you do that?

843
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:35,140
你还记得在你小时候  我带你去看的魔术表演吗
Remember when I took you to that magic show when you were a kid?

844
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,060
他们让一个女人消失掉了
They made a woman disappear.

845
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:44,320
还记得他们把她锁定一个盒子里  然后砰的一下
Yeah. Remember, they locked her in a box, and poof!

846
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,320
她就消失了
She was gone.

847
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:50,120
你靠近我
You leaned over to me,

848
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,200
问我  “爸比  他们是怎么做到的”
you said, "Daddy, how'd they do that?"

849
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,670
还记得我怎么回答你的吗  记得吗
Remember what I said? Remember?

850
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,250
这是魔术
"It's magic.

851
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:00,960
这个女人会消失一会儿
The woman will disappear for a bit,

852
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,090
但她总会出现的
but she will always come out."

853
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:07,550
我们整个周末都在家里玩儿捉迷藏游戏
We spent the whole week playing hide\and\seek all over the house.

854
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,550
你知道吗
And you know what?

855
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,140
我总能找到你
I always found you.

856
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:21,690
你总会出来的
And you always came out.

857
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,530
拜托了  出来吧
Please, come out.

858
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,070
那行吧
Right, then.

859
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,730
金伯莉
Kimberly!

860
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,040
小心你的耳朵哟  亲爱的
Watch your ears, sweetheart.

861
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,480
快点
Come on!

862
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,410
再稍等一会儿  马上就弄好了
Just a little more, I'll be right there!

863
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,640
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

864
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,590
简  我是亨利
Jane? It's Henry.

865
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,380
我挺好的  你还好吗
Oh, I'm fine. Yeah, how are you?

866
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:40,010
呃  不  实际上  她现在正在忙别的事情
Uh, no, actually, right this second, she's in the middle of something.

867
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,850
等她忙完了我会让她给你回个电话的
So, uh, hey, I could get her to call you back when she's finished.

868
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,900
- 她给你打了电话  什么时候  - 救命
\She called you? When? \Help!

869
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,310
- 她现在有点幽居病的症状  - 救救我
\She is feeling a little cabin fever. \Help me!

870
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,820
- 这是个好现象  对不对  - 救救我  拜托了
\So, that's a good sign, right? \Help me, please!

871
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,820
- 救命  - 我觉得她有点
\Help! \I just think maybe

872
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,950
- 过于热心想去  - 救救我
\she was a little overzealous... \Help me!

873
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,530
你家住一下了
...about asking for a sleepover.

874
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:00,910
当然了  你应该来的
Absolutely, you should, yeah.

875
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,790
金伯莉肯定很想见你  你知道的
Kimberly would love to see you, you know.

876
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:07,000
听我说  再给我几天时间  说真的  家里太乱了
Tell you what, give me a couple of days. Honestly, the place is a mess.

877
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,420
等我把房子收拾好
If I can just get the house in order.

878
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,710
好的  照顾好自己
Yeah, take care.

879
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,800
他妈的
Jesus fucking Christ.

880
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,850
刚才是你简姨妈打来的
So that was your Aunt Jane.

881
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:28,770
她说你给她留过一个言  说要去她家住
She said you had left a message. Something about making a trip?

882
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,770
你这根本没帮上什么忙  亲爱的
You're not doing us any favors, honey.

883
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,030
金
Kim?

884
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,610
得了吧  我非得下去找你吗
Oh, come on, do I have to come down in there and get you?

885
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,030
妈的
Damn it!

886
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,660
金伯莉
Kimberly?

887
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,410
我知道你很害怕  金  但我觉得你没想明白
I know you're scared, Kim, but I don't think you get it.

888
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,540
我想帮你  我是你爸爸
I'm trying to help you. I'm your father.

889
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,090
我爱你
I love you.

890
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,670
不管你做了什么
Doesn't matter what you did.

891
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,940
你要给我保持安静  按照我说的做
You're gonna remain completely quiet and do exactly as I say.

892
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,940
否则  有人就会受伤
Otherwise, someone is gonna get hurt.

893
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,700
金伯莉
Kimberly.

894
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,250
金伯莉
Kimberly.

895
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,130
上去
Go.

896
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,650
桑德斯医生
Dr. Saunders?

897
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:55,520
嗨  抱歉我来晚了  今天真是个噩梦
Hi. I'm sorry I'm running a bit late. It's been a nightmare of a day.

898
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:59,190
到处都是假期造成的混乱  还有人们对黑色星期五的狂热
There's all this post\holiday chaos and Black Friday mania.

899
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,200
我应该打电话说一下我会晚一点到的
I should have called and said I was running behind.

900
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,240
你还好吗
Are you okay?

901
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,740
你是指什么
What do you mean?

902
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:09,710
你看起来  很脏
Well, you look... dirty.

903
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,210
哦  是的  我一直在装修房子
Oh. Yeah, I've been working on the house.

904
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
哦
Oh.

905
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,420
我能进来吗
May I come in?

906
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,800
实际上  我们得重新定个时间了
We're gonna have to reschedule, actually.

907
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,100
我有好多工作要做  现在实在不是时候
Yeah, I got a lot of work to do, and it's not a good time right now.

908
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,600
爸爸
Dad?

909
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,230
没关系
It's okay.

910
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,770
她可以进来
She can come in.

911
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:36,230
我觉得现在不太合适
I don't think it's a good idea right now.

912
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,240
桑德斯医生大老远跑过来
Dr. Saunders came all this way.

913
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:44,950
没事的
It's fine.

914
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,780
我们可以回头再弄完这件事  对吧
We could finish up later, right?

915
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,080
好吧
Okay.

916
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,590
- 哇  你真的没在开玩笑啊  - 是啊
\Oh, wow, you weren't kidding. \Yeah.

917
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,340
这儿看起来像被炸弹炸过一样
Looks like a bomb went off in here.

918
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,170
是啊  今天过得有点不大顺利
Yeah, it's kind of a rough day.

919
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,510
呃  今天最好在这里吧
Um, better in here today.

920
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,930
好的
Okay.

921
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:08,350
不过你爸爸能让你有事做是件好事
Well, it's a good thing your dad's keeping you busy, though.

922
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,600
是啊
Yeah.

923
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,560
呃  听我说  今天我想跟着旁听一下
Uh, listen, I'm gonna sit in on this one.

924
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,860
如果你觉得可以的话
If that's okay with you.

925
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,030
好的
Okay.

926
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:30,200
所以说  你还在吃药吗
So, um, are you still taking your medication?

927
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,700
没有
No.

928
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:33,870
为什么呢
Why not?

929
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,580
我应该是忘记吃了吧
I guess I forgot.

930
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,840
那不吃的话你是什么感觉呢
Then how are you feeling without it?

931
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,760
我的大脑更清醒了
My head's clearer.

932
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:47,090
那些恐慌症呢  他们是加剧了  还是减弱了呢
And have the panic attacks, have they increased or decreased?

933
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,390
我说不好  有时候我觉得自己被困住了
I don't know, sometimes I feel trapped.

934
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:53,520
困住了
Trapped?

935
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,270
困在这个房子里
In this house.

936
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,770
不完全是吧
Not literally.

937
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,780
怎么说呢
How so?

938
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,110
就像我想要出去
Like I want to get out,

939
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,990
但我出不去
but I can't.

940
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,780
好吧  那是什么阻碍了你呢
Okay. What's holding you back?

941
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,450
我不知道我爸爸会遇到什么事
I don't know what will happen to my dad.

942
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:16,670
所以你害怕如果你离开的话  你可能会见不到你爸爸了吗
So you're afraid if you leave, you might not see your dad again?

943
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:20,250
更像是我不会再回来了
More like I won't come back.

944
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,460
这叫做成长  金
Well, that's called growing up, Kim.

945
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,880
我们大家最后都会这样的
And it happens to all of us eventually.

946
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:30,100
孩子们总要离开父母
Children leave.

947
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,350
但是咱们一步一步来
But one step at a time.

948
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:35,560
首先  先让你离开前门  好吗
Let's just get you out the front door first, okay?

949
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,480
我忘记给你做杯喝的了
I never offered you a drink.

950
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:43,820
没事的  谢谢你
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

951
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,490
不  不  不  我沏的茶很好喝的
No, no, no, I make a great cup of tea.

952
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:50,240
我的简姨妈  也就是我妈妈的妹妹  她刚送了我一些新茶
And my Aunt Jane, she's my mom's sister, just sent me these new teas to try,

953
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,160
我想把它们混在一起  沏自己的配方
and I like to mix them together and make my own.

954
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,910
我这儿有仕女茶和黑加仑
I've got Lady Grey, Black Currant.

955
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:55,040
混在一起就像黑色仕女茶一样
Kinda like Black Grey, you know?

956
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,290
- 金  算了吧  - 你确定吗
\Kim, she's fine. \Are you sure?

957
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:57,370
别逼人家了
Stop pushing.

958
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,500
你知道吗  好吧
You know what? Um, yes.

959
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:04,800
好的  我想尝一下著名的金伯莉・托姆斯特酿
Yes, I would like to try the famous Kimberly Tooms brew.

960
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,800
太好了
Great.

961
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,380
我现在就去做
I will go make that now.

962
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,010
除非你想去做
Unless you'd like to make it.

963
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,020
不
No.

964
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,230
桑德斯医生肯定想要一杯你特制的茶
Dr. Saunders would like a Kim special.

965
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:22,520
如果你想喝的话  我也可以给你做一杯
I can make you one too if you want.

966
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,190
好的  别去太久
Sure. Just don't take too long.

967
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,310
- 一切还好吗  - 挺好的
\ Everything okay in there? \Fine.

968
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:57,100
感恩节过得怎么样啊
How was Thanksgiving?

969
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:18,330
好了  给你
Okay, there we go.

970
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,750
谢谢你
Thank you.

971
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,460
这一杯是什么呢
Which one is this?

972
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,830
我选了  祁门红茶
Uh, I chose the Keemun,

973
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,000
加了一撮白玫瑰
with a pinch of the White Rose.

974
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,250
有可能会不好喝
It could suck.

975
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,800
这是黑茶  也就是牛奶和糖
It's black tea, so just, you know, milk and sugar.

976
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,590
我觉得牛奶变质了
Think the milk turned.

977
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,970
我觉得挺好喝的  我明白你为什么这么执意推荐了
I think it's lovely. I see what all the fuss is about.

978
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,570
我想谈谈我妈妈的事
I want to talk about my mom.

979
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,410
好的  我们当然可以谈了  如果你愿意的话
All right. Um, we can certainly do that, if you feel up to it.

980
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,530
我愿意
I do.

981
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:58,080
这件事我们可以慢慢来
Maybe we could take our time with that.

982
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,290
呃  如果金伯莉想谈的话  这是她的选择
Uh, if Kimberly wants to talk about that, it's her choice.

983
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,540
她可以谈论任何她想谈的东西
She can go wherever she wants to in these sessions.

984
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,380
我确实想谈谈这件事
I do want to talk about it.

985
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,750
那就说吧
Go ahead.

986
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:14,130
我最近一直在想这件事
I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

987
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,560
在想发生在她身上的事情  还有那个
You know, about what happened to her, and the man

988
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,930
杀了她的男人
the man who killed her.

989
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:25,400
我考虑了很多  如果与他见面要说什么
I thought a lot about what I would say to him if I ever had the chance.

990
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,980
说什么呢
And what would that be?

991
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:29,070
我不会问他为什么
I wouldn't ask him why.

992
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,280
不
No.

993
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,320
我知道为什么
I know why.

994
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,870
他这么做是因为心理有病
He did it because he's sick.

995
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:39,410
他喜欢杀戮
Because he enjoys it.

996
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,870
他可能自己心里很平和
He probably justifies it to himself.

997
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:47,710
那样的人为自己的所有行为都能找理由
A man like that invents excuses to do what he does.

998
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,760
为自己的变态找理由
To excuse his own sickness.

999
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:57,300
还记得你第一次告诉我  我生活在茧中
Remember you first told me that I was in a cocoon?

1000
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:02,270
就像是想要逃脱的蝴蝶一样
Like a butterfly struggling to get out?

1001
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,350
也许他也生活在茧里
Maybe he's in a cocoon, too.

1002
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:07,400
只是他藏在了自己的
Except... he hides in his,

1003
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,320
阴暗的茧中
where it's dark...

1004
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,990
在那里没人能看到
where no one can see him

1005
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,570
他的真面孔
for what he really is.

1006
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,660
我想告诉他  他是禽兽  也是胆小鬼
And I'd tell him he's a monster and a coward.

1007
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,630
你觉得他会怎么回答你
And what do you think he would say to you?

1008
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,590
恐怕今天就进行到这里吧
I'm afraid that's all the time we have for today.

1009
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,930
家里有好多活没干完
So much work to do around the house.

1010
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,430
抱歉  医生
Sorry, Doctor.

1011
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,430
嗯  好吧
Right. Well, um,

1012
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,810
我们有了新的进展  金柏莉
I think we were breaking new ground here, Kimberly.

1013
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,900
也许下次再会面  我们可以冒险出去
Um, maybe at our next session, we can venture outside

1014
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,190
上院子里走走
maybe into the yard?

1015
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,070
我觉得可以
I'd like that.

1016
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:06,330
茶泡得很好
Great job with the tea.

1017
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,540
给你五颗星
Five stars.

1018
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,350
谢谢  医生
Well, thank you, Doctor.

1019
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:27,020
我其实要问你们俩一个问题
Um... I actually need to ask you both something.

1020
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,310
- 什么问题  -  昨晚我收到一通电话
\What's that? \I got a call last night

1021
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:33,980
班克斯警官打来的好像  她说被叫到了这里
from an Officer Banks, I believe? She said they were called to this address.

1022
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:37,490
她想确认我是金柏莉的医生
She wanted to confirm that I was Kimberly's doctor.

1023
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,280
有什么需要我知道的吗
Is there anything I should know?

1024
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,790
- 没有  - 没
\No. \No.

1025
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:45,910
没有
No.

1026
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,200
好的
All right.

1027
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:53,590
- 周末愉快  - 谢谢
\Oh, um, have a good weekend. \Thank you.

1028
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,210
好的
Okay.

1029
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,920
你麻烦大了
You are in so much trouble!

1030
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,430
你想知道
You wanted to know.

1031
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:47,680
现在就知道了
Now you know.

1032
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,450
我得把她弄走  小金
I'm gonna have to get rid of her, Kim.

1033
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,000
我不喜欢这么工作
I don't like to work like this.

1034
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,750
我喜欢小心  精准  不留痕迹
I like to be careful, precise, no traces.

1035
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:19,550
这些姑娘们需要受到惩罚
These girls need to be punished.

1036
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,260
我不能让她们影响你
I can't let them influence you.

1037
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,930
不能让你被她们的真面目上海
I can't risk you being exposed to what they are.

1038
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,560
我保护你  小金
I protect you, Kim.

1039
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,520
你知道的  对吧
You know that, right?

1040
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,730
这是我存在的理由  为了给你提供安全的环境
That's my purpose on earth, to make it safer for you.

1041
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,810
为了帮你蜕茧成蝶做准备
For when you come out of your cocoon.

1042
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,530
从蝶蛹变身后
Upon emerging from its chrysalis,

1043
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:46,160
蝴蝶会进入生命周期中最脆弱的状态
the butterfly is at its most vulnerable state in its life cycle.

1044
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,580
在那结束之前  它是没办法飞的
Until that's done, it can't fly.

1045
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,540
所以很容易被鸟儿等捕食者猎杀
And then it's easy prey for birds and other predators.

1046
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:56,580
你妈妈一直都不懂这一点  不过  她也从来
Your mother never understood that. But then again, she never helped us

1047
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:59,710
没帮你做锅5年级的科学展览项目  对吧
with your fifth\grade science fair project, either, did she?

1048
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,550
得了第二名  真骄傲
Second place. So proud.

1049
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,890
但是当她发现
But then when she found out...

1050
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,810
是啊  就像是破镜重圆一样
yeah, it was like trying to put broken glass back together.

1051
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:16,810
我能怎么做
What was I supposed to do?

1052
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,440
她本来要去报警
She was just gonna tell the cops,

1053
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,860
这样他们就永远把你从我身边夺走
and then they'd take you away from me forever.

1054
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,480
我除了爱你就是爱你
I never did anything but love you.

1055
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:26,320
我进了自己最大可能去了解情况
I did the best I could under the circumstances.

1056
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:30,780
你没有别的要说的了吗
Do you not have anything to add?

1057
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:34,910
你就不想负担点责任吗
You don't want to take a little personal responsibility for this?

1058
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:40,130
这是你的错  你做的  金柏莉
You did this. This is your fault, Kimberly.

1059
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:44,800
如果你听我的话  桑德斯医生就不会死
Dr. Saunders would still be alive if you just did as you were told.

1060
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,850
但是你就是不能  你就是不听话
But you couldn't do it. You couldn't toe the line.

1061
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,390
现在我们到了这里
And now this is where we are.

1062
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:07,320
如果你还像个孩子一样  那我就当你是孩子
If you act like a child, you'll be treated like one.

1063
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,990
我不是坏人  根本不是
I'm not a bad man. Not at all.

1064
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,660
总有一天  你会离开家门
One day, you're gonna walk out that door,

1065
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:17,290
然后明白我为你打造了一个安全的世界
and you'll get that I made the world a safer place for you.

1066
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,080
这些姑娘们
These girls...

1067
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,630
这些女人  他们都希望你去
these women, they all want you to...

1068
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:29,130
只是希望你向她们一样
Well, just want you to be like them.

1069
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,220
即使你没见过她们
Even if you haven't met them,

1070
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,260
她们带来的影响  她们的能量  都还在
their influence, their energy, it's out there.

1071
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,520
我决不允许你受她们影响
And I would never allow that.

1072
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,810
永远不允许
Ever.

1073
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:40,270
你是我的女儿
You're my girl.

1074
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:41,900
是我人生最辉煌的成就
The best thing I ever did.

1075
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,520
我做的一切事情都是
I always did everything for...

1076
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:44,650
为了你
for you.

1077
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:47,440
为了我们
F\For us.

1078
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,820
草泥马
Fuck you.

1079
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,250
嘿  你真是
Hey... you just...

1080
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,010
小金
Kim...

1081
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,720
异丙酚
Propofol.

1082
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,150
好的  好的
Oh, yes. Okay.

1083
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,910
该死  快点
Fuck, come on.

1084
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,670
好
Okay.

1085
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,860
接电话  接电话
\ \Pick up, pick up.

1086
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,860
是蒂姆・奥戴来电话了吗
Is that Tim O'Day calling?

1087
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:15,530
天啊  万一是呢
Oh, my God, what if it is?

1088
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,030
班克斯  喂
Banks. Hello?

1089
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,370
你好  我是金柏莉・托姆斯
Yeah. Hi, it's Kimberly Tooms.

1090
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:21,040
还记得你说  如果有任何事给你打电话吗
Remember, you said to call\\ to call you if something bad happened?

1091
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,120
我记得
Yeah, I remember.

1092
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:23,960
我爸爸有事  你快点过来吧  好吗
It's my Dad. You have to come now, okay?

1093
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,040
你快点带走他
You have to take him away.

1094
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,590
- 他伤害你了吗  - 他伤害了她
\Has he hurt you? \He killed her.

1095
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:29,460
索菲・泰勒  电视上说的那个失踪女孩
Sophie Taylor? You know, the missing girl from the TV?

1096
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,960
他应该还杀死了不少女孩
I think he's killed other girls.

1097
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:33,130
他在我面前杀死了我心理医生
I mean, he killed my therapist right in front of me.

1098
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:34,220
我没听错吧
Am I hearing you right?

1099
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,840
你是说你爸爸在你眼前杀人了
You're telling me your dad killed somebody in front of you?

1100
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,890
- 是的  - 你爸爸现在在哪  金柏莉
\Yes. \Okay, where's your dad now, Kimberly?

1101
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,640
他晕倒在地上了
Um, he's... he's passed out on the floor.

1102
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,730
我给他下药了
I drugged him.

1103
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:43,810
但是不知道能持续多久
But I don't know how much longer it's going to last.

1104
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:46,310
好吧  你快点从家里离开  好吗
Okay, I just need you to get out of the house immediately, okay?

1105
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,020
我感觉出不去
I don't know if I can, okay?

1106
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:50,530
他把所有地方都封死了  我被锁起来了
He boarded everything up. I'm locked in.

1107

1113
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,420
尽可能往外跑  好吗

1114
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,420

We've go units on the way, okay? Can you hear me?

1115

1116

有些事情不对劲
Something's wrong.

1117

但是白玫瑰茶喝起来挺舒服的
But the White Rose tea was very soothing.
