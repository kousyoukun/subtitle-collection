lot of stress lately. That's all.

644
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:32,200
This just happens to everybody.

645
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:39,998
Who did you call?

646
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,459
No one.

647
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,051
Oh, sweetheart.

648
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,930
I really wish you hadn't done that.

649
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,934
It's okay. We'll sort
this whole mess out.

650
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:05,524
So, what are we gonna do now?

651
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:09,027
Police are on their way, so you're
gonna have a lot of explaining to do.

652
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,321
So do you.

653
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,703
So, who's gonna take care
of you when I'm not around?

654
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:19,831
Did you think of that?

655
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:24,208
No, without me, there's
no roof over your head.

656
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,752
A roof, which I'd like to point out,

657
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:28,129
that you're too afraid to
get out from under anyway.

658
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,632
Probably just wind up
in a damn nut house.

659
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:33,217
Rubber rooms and
straightjackets for you.

660
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:34,638
You're the one who needs help.

661
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:37,096
I didn't do anything.

662
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:39,350
You're acting paranoid. Delusional.

663
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,518
That's not true.

664
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,979
All right, you listen to me.

665
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:49,570
Are you sure?

666
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:53,615
Sweetheart, you've
known me your whole life.

667
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:56,868
I've always been there for you.

668
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,330
I never hit you.

669
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,209
I never hurt you.

670
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,546
Barely even raise my voice.

671
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:09,840
Have I?

672
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,260
Well, have I?

673
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,058
Because I love you, Kimberly.
You mean everything to me.

674
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:23,226
[SOBS] But what about the jewelry?

675
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:25,186
I mean, I just don't
believe it was Mom's.

676
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:26,773
Doesn't matter what you believe.

677
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,107
I'm sorry you found it.

678
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,110
I really am.

679
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:32,905
It hasn't been easy.

680
00:43:32,908 --> 00:43:34,988
What happened to your
mother is an awful thing,

681
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,992
but you can't blame <i>me</i> for that.

682
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:41,870
I know you hate me, I get it.

683
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:45,584
I have been somewhat remote lately.

684
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,962
But I've had so much on my mind.

685
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:54,591
I just wanted this first Thanksgiving
without your mother to be...

686
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:56,512
I don't know, somehow...

687
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,055
okay for you.

688
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:01,892
For us.

689
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:06,479
But am I guilty of being a murderer?

690
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:14,445
How can you even think that?

691
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,618
So when those police officers show up,

692
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:21,703
you need to be certain of that.

693
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:23,914
You need to know in here,

694
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,043
and you need to know in here.

695
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,087
Without any doubt.

696
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,551
Otherwise, you'd destroy
what's left of our family.

697
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:39,095
So, now

698
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:43,389
do you feel that you're
one hundred percent positive

699
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,519
that I am who you think I am?

700
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,732
Good.

701
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:56,055
Then when the police officers
do show up, don't say anything.

702
00:44:57,155 --> 00:45:01,115
It's the medication and your
condition that's warping your thinking.

[HENRY] Evening.

709
00:45:18,176 --> 00:45:21,469
We received a 911 call from this
address in the last half hour.

710
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,513
A young woman said she was in distress.

711
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,056
Yeah, that would be my daughter.

712
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,766
- Are you the homeowner?
- Yes.

713
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:27,851
[FOSTER] And your name?

714
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:28,959
Henry Tooms.

715
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:31,813
Mr. Tooms, on the basis of this call,

716
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:34,440
we have just cause to enter
your property to conduct a search

717
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:37,611
and to interview both you and your
daughter. Do you have a problem with this?

718
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,322
No, please, come in.

719
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:43,118
Apologies for the mess.

721
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,709
Are you Kimberly? Did you
make the 9-1-1 call?

722
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:54,221
- Yeah.
- It's a bit embarrassing, actually.

723
00:45:54,224 --> 00:45:55,545
Kim just overreacted.

724
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:58,256
Mr. Tooms, we're gonna need you to
step outside the room for a minute.

725
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,340
Why?

No.

No.

00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:23,114
So your dad's renovating, huh?

735
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:25,116
[KIMBERLY] Oh. Um, yeah.

736
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:26,618
It's been taking a while.

00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,204
- May I?
- Sure.

- Ooh! No, no.
- Sorry.

No, no, I got it. It's mine.

tell me what happened here tonight.

Think you can do that for me?

742
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:46,429
You must get a lot of bogus
domestic calls at the holidays.

You made the call for a reason.

Just tell me what... what
made you pick up the phone.

Nothing.

He's right. I overreacted.

So, your daughter's prone

No, she's...

She's such a good girl.

So you're suggesting this is
the reason she made that call?

761
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:43,027
Officer, my daughter's been a
shut-in since this happened.

She can't even leave the house.

763
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,823
She'll have a panic attack
when the front door opens.

00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:49,784
I can't unlatch a window
without her getting dizzy.

- My dad got me a therapist.

Well, the house is just... it's
all over the place right now, you know?

00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:36,247
All right.

782
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:39,292
She went up to the attic, and I
told her... Well, I don't know.

783
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:41,335
She was up there to see
some of her mom's old stuff,

so, like, you know.

But she practically broke
her neck, so I got...

I just... I lost it,

00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:49,429
so she ran to her
room, wouldn't come out.

00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:53,890
You know, I raised my
voice with her a bit.

789
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,212
I don't think she was used to it.

have you ever hit her before?

No. Never.

No. I was just mad.

This is... I shouldn't
have said anything.

I don't...

800

I don't want him to get in any trouble.

00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:24,297
I understand that. He's your dad.

It could suck.

1110
01:14:28,343 --> 01:14:30,885
It's black tea, so just,
you know, milk and sugar.

01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:33,054
Think the milk turned.

1112

I think it's lovely. I see
what all the fuss is about.

I want to talk about my mom.

1114
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:54,492
All right. Um, we can certainly
do that, if you feel up to it.

1115
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,619

01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:58,162
Maybe we could take our time with that.

Uh, if Kimberly wants to talk
about that, it's her choice.

She can go wherever she
wants to in these sessions.

01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,462
I do want to talk about it.

01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:07,758
Go ahead.

1121
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:14,139
I've been thinking
about it a lot lately.

1122
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:18,560
You know, about what happened
to her, and the man...

1123
01:15:19,352 --> 01:15:21,019
The man who killed her.

1124
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:25,481
I thought a lot about what I would
say to him if I ever had the chance.
