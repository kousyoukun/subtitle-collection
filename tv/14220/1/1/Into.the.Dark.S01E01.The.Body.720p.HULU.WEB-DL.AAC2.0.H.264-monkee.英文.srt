20
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,550
Is it done?

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,490
He was eating Sardinian casu marzu.

22
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,440
I didn't realize it was still possible

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,010
to get casu marzu in this country.

24
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,580
The stomach acid of a thousand maggots

25
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,240
rotting the cheese from the inside out,

26
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,360
making it richer,

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,360
smoother.

28
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,830
But...for the whole thing to work,

29
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,670
you must eat all of it.

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,020
The maggots are what make the experience wonderful.

31
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,010
I didn't call you for

32
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,150
a Gordon Ramsay impression, Wilkes.

33
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,530
I ask again.

34
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,540
Is it done?

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,200
It's done.

36
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,110
I wonder what kind of a man gets casu marzu on demand.

37
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,970
You know who he is, don't you?

38
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,180
Of course I do.

39
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,720
The press are breaking a story on him in the morning.

40
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,020
No one does this better than you,

41
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,570
and I need him delivered before that happens.

42
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,610
Bring him to the usual place by 2am.

43
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,260
That's in four hours.

44
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,550
No delays.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,300
I trust you to help me make a statement with this one.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,110
Well, he's dead already.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,740
The rest shouldn't take too long.

48
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,670
Good.

49
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,150
Oh, and Wilkes?

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,570
I know you have your own methods and I respect that.

51
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,290
But maybe try and treat this like business,

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,770
just for once?

53
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,840
Great costume.

56
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,310
Happy Halloween, dick!

57
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,150
God dammit!

58
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,550
What is this shit?

59
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,540
Son of a bitch!

60
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,490
You've got to be kidding me!

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Holy shit, man!

62
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,860
Watch where you're going.

63
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,180
What the fuck?

64
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,710
Jesus Christ.

65
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,260
Did you make this?

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,750
This is unbelievable.

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,560
Oh my God, dude.

68
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,210
This looks so real.

69
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,410
Dot, look at this thing.

70
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,760
Don't call me Dot.

71
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,860
Wait a second.

72
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,430
What are you doing right now?

73
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,040
I know, I know that's a weird thing to ask a stranger, but, uh,

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,950
we're on our way to this party,

75
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,030
and it's gonna be outrageously cool

76
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,340
and, like, super sick,

77
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,700
and I was kind of hoping we can make a big entrance

78
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,750
at this thing, but, um,

79
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,060
as you can see...

80
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,030
we look pathetic, so...

81
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,630
I got off work, like, 30 minutes ago, so...

82
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,840
Still could have made an effort, Nick.

83
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,970
- Well, I... - What are you supposed to be?

84
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,030
- What are you dressed as? - This is steampunk.

85
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,240
- This and... - Goggles?

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,940
You're dressed as goggles?

87
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm sorry, who are you?

88
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,510
Oh, shit, sorry, Alan Morgan Adams

89
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,780
of the Massachusetts Morgan Adamses.

90
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,060
Hey, hey, buddy,

91
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,730
Where are we goin'?

92
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,950
Are you, like, uh,

93
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,290
the British American Psycho or something?

94
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,420
Whoa, Dorothy.

95
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,980
Sorry, you gotta forgive her.

96
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,710
She's from Westlake.

97
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,270
We're still workin' on her manners.

98
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,310
We're kind of a...

99
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,890
My Fair Lady type of deal.

100
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
He's the, uh, self-important drunk perv

101
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,230
who thinks that he's a big deal,

102
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,200
and I'm just the bad ass everyone wants to hang out with.

103
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,550
So is this, like, your...

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,100
latest victim or something?

105
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,900
Yes, for now.

106
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,590
Okay, dude, dude, dude, dude.

107
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,940
Uh, you gotta come with us.

108
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,840
What can I say

109
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,290
that is gonna get you there?

110
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,450
There's gonna be an open bar.

111
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,240
Does that do anything for you?

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,930
There's gonna be outrageously hot chicks,

113
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,620
like crazy hot chicks.

114
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,240
- Fucking gag me. - Okay, okay.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,700
Everybody is gonna be there, man.

116
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,940
I can assure you

117
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,360
that the party we're going to

118
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
is a million times cooler

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,950
than the party you were going to.

120
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,760
My buddy Jack,

121
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
he, uh, he's the host.

122
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,310
He always does this, like,

123
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,680
grand arrival,

124
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,810
and everyone flips out about his costume, but this thing,

125
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,290
this is gonna blow his cock off.

126
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,220
Look, uh, someone slashed my tires,

127
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,870
and I really need...

128
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,900
You need a ride.

129
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,590
Done.

130
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,340
That we can do.

131
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,370
We can get you a ride, man.

132
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,720
Consider it done.

133
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,960
Please walk away.

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,390
Yeah, no, there's...

135
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,840
there's no way you're gonna get a cab

136
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,090
with this thing, dude, so...

137
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,650
He's right, that's a good point, Nick.

138
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,010
Thank you for finally making a contribution.

139
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,330
No one's gonna let you in the back of a cab

140
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,540
with this thing, you'll make a mess.

141
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,410
Come with us for one drink.

142
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,650
Just one drink, you walk right back out,

143
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,960
you're out on the streets,

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,040
you're killin' all your victims in no time.

145
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,650
You know what?

146
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,020
That actually sounds like a really good idea.

147
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,130
Let's do it.

148
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,390
What?

149
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,360
I can't believe that worked.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,860
Wow, I did not see that coming.

151
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,960
It's the best night of my life.

152
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,190
This is exciting.

153
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,090
What an exciting turn of events.

154
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,430
Lift with your legs, Nick.

155
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,530
There's four of us.

156
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,780
If we all just, um...

157
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,890
Oh my gosh.

158
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,430
Slashed your tires, huh?

159
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,620
Bunch of fuckin' savages in this town.

160
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,550
Put your back into it, Nick.

161
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,620
It's pretty heavy.

162
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,010
Oh yeah, here we go!

163
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,990
This way, this way, come on!

164
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,800
Here we go again!

165
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,380
That ought to be good.

166
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,530
Prop him up there.

167
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,270
Do not move, okay?

168
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,010
Don't move, I'm gonna go find Jack.

169
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,180
Especially this guy.

170
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,450
Everybody raise your hands!

171
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,190
Where is this guy?

172
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,820
Girls and boys,

173
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,800
queer gender friends,

174
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,930
please turn your eyes to the dance floor

175
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,210
and welcome your host,

176
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,640
Jack Baker,

177
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,770
Monster Maker!

178
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,770
Oh, shit.

179
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,480
Hello Alan.

180
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,630
Unreal.

181
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,790
Dalmore neat, double.

182
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,050
Here.

183
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,910
Here, want it?

184
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,480
Excuse me.

185
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,090
Your costume is...

186
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,730
brilliant.

187
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,460
It's not a costume.

188
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,060
Uh, yeah, more of a prop, I guess, right?

189
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,810
The whole package really works.

190
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,820
The suit, the blood.

191
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,340
Maggie.

192
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,840
Let them eat cake.

193
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,320
She never said that.

194
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,370
You know, Marie Antoinette,

196
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,560
she never actually said,

197
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,340
"Let them eat cake."

198
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,820
It was just a thing that French like to attribute

199
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,760
to every foreign queen they didn't like the look of.

200
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,770
I mean, when things go wrong,

201
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,190
why blame the king when you can blame his bitch of a wife?

202
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,710
She's a very meaningful woman, I think.

203
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,690
Um, famous,

204
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,780
but as a caricature that confirms men's prejudices against women

205
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,050
frivolous, ditzy,

206
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,320
obsessed with buying shoes,

207
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,820
silly, pretty, tragic little bonbon

208
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,510
good for porn, good for scorn,

209
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,820
nothing in between.

210
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,400
Well, you have really thought about your costume.

211
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,530
Says the guy dragging a corpse around?

212
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,920
Did you not come here with friends, Maggie?

213
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,970
Just me.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,510
I hesitated to come, but tonight felt like

215
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,820
the kind of night something might happen.

216
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,020
Well, you certainly make that costume work.

217
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,010
A girl is expected to dress a little provocatively

218
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,970
when she's invited to one of these parties.

219
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,130
Why would a girl want to be

220
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,540
invited to one of these parties?

221
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,710
Oh, I don't know,

222
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,760
one of these parties,

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,570
one of these clubs,

224
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,790
one of these jobs.

225
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,110
It might be 230 years since the French Revolution,

226
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,130
but boys still need the illusion

227
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,170
of silly, tragic little bonbons.

228
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,080
Maybe that's not your problem.

229
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,780
Maybe that's obviously occurred to me before,

230
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,730
and I don't need it mansplained to me by a stranger.

231
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,870
So how long did it take you to stuff it?

232
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,740
You don't stuff it, it's more of, um...roll,

233
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,350
like a...pig in blanket.

234
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,830
Those are harder to roll cleanly than they look.

235
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,960
It gets easier every time you do it.

236
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,090
I do it this way every Halloween.

237
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,550
You have to be a lot more careful disposing of a dead body

238
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,090
on a normal evening.

239
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,610
Right.

240
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,630
Would you like me to, uh...

241
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,400
let you in on something?

242
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,800
People think that killing is the hard part.

243
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,520
They also assume that the necessary next step

244
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,500
is hiding the evidence,

245
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,520
but it's not.

246
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,240
You can't do it, not reliably.

247
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,720
You have to come up with an alternative story

248
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
for how this person died.

249
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,600
Needs its own narrative, its own evidence,

250
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,710
its own culprit.

251
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,490
Takes more effort,

252
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,530
but if you can do it correctly,

253
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,870
it works.

254
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,620
You can do anything,

255
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,370
as long as you don't give people the time to decide

256
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,360
it's something different from what you're telling them it is.

257
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,870
And that...is what makes this...

258
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,560
special.

259
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,090
That makes sense.

260
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,830
I'm not sure it all comes across in the costume, but...

261
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,530
that makes sense.

262
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,650
Okay, dude, a toast to every Friday the 13th movie.

263
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,480
Let's do this.

264
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,690
Friday the 13th.

265
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,390
Friday the 13th Part 2. Part 2.

266
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,130
"Midway upon life's journey,

267
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,550
I found myself within a forest dark."

268
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,600
"For the straightforward path had been lost."

269
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,680
Hell's empty and all the devils are here.

270
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,480
Jason Takes Manhattan.

271
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,360
Are you leaving?

272
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,320
I've been promised a ride to work.

273
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,470
You came with that guy Alan, right?

274
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,060
He's friends with Jack.

275
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,350
I work for Jack.

276
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,300
Um, he's designing this horror virtual reality thing,

277
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,270
and I'm the coder who has to do all the damn work.

278
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,710
It's really...

279
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,810
really makes you feel good about those student loan debts.

280
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,510
Worth it.

281
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,800
Um, I can, uh,

282
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,450
get you a car and drive you.

283
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,110
Is anybody expecting you home tonight, Maggie?

284
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,430
Not a soul.

285
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,490
Well, all right then.

286
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,860
I'll be right back.

287
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,740
Hey, what's up, girl?

288
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,100
Hey, sexual harassment is a crime, shithead.

289
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,860
- Whatever. - Criminal!

290
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,270
Uh, we're almost ready.

291
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,910
I just...the body thing is huge.

292
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,390
I was just...figured we could use

293
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,180
some help getting it downstairs.

294
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,250
There is no "We."

295
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,720
What?

296
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,030
I agreed to one drink. I've had three.

297
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,890
Car, now.

298
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,780
- Dude, chill. - What, no.

299
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,060
I already told Maggie you can borrow my car.

300
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,590
Now come on!

301
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,110
Enjoy yourself for a bit, huh?

302
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,230
Take me to your car now

303
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,740
or I will kill you at your own party.

304
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,050
You really got this killer thing down.

305
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,500
You nailed it.

306
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,740
I like it.

307
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,310
All right, all right.

308
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,660
I'll take you downstairs.

309
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,460
But first, shots!

310
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,840
Finally we get to the good shit.

311
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,070
Dude, he never lets anyone in there.

312
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,270
This night's gonna be epic. Okay?

313
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,970
Hey, don't break anything.

314
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,610
Come on, one shot won't kill you.

315
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,350
Every single one of those

316
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,640
literally cost thousands of dollars.

317
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,580
Yeah, I got money

318
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,900
and talent.

319
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,950
So I'm gonna need those car keys now.

320
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,310
Yeah, we should probably get back to the party.

321
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,940
Aw, not yet, guys.

322
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,930
Come on.

323
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,090
Hey, where are you going in such a hurry anyway?

324
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,990
Can we come?

325
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,810
Yo, dude,

326
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,720
this is your party.

327
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,180
You got Sasha Grey DJing.

328
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,610
You can't leave...he can't leave the party.

329
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,500
I can do whatever I want.

330
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,790
Guys, this...this is what tonight is all about.

331
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,440
All Hallow's Eve,

332
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,430
the night we put our masks on

333
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,950
and let our dark, unpredictable sides fly.

334
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,630
This guy, man, look at him.

335
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,420
The costume, woo!

336
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,660
The performance.

337
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,930
I'm telling you, bro,

338
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,150
next level commitment.

339
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,150
Think about it, guys.

340
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,460
How do we usually end the night?

341
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,350
Me, sittin' at home

342
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,140
watching Plan 9 from Outer Space,

343
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,350
mixing cocktails,

344
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,100
sending unsolicited dick pics to Dorothy.

345
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,310
Or, guys, we keep the party goin', right?

346
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,470
Keep the party goin',

347
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,710
lookin' for somebody,

348
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,370
like this guy right here.

349
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,550
I don't know what's goin' down tonight,

350
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,440
but I am feeling so,

351
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,840
what's the word? Alive.

352
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm feelin' so alive right now, guys.

353
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,750
Yeah, he, um...

354
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,780
he occasionally, uh...

355
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,970
does that.

356
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,510
Wait.

357
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

358
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,680
This animatronic too?

359
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,210
Woo, that is amazing!

360
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,210
Give it a kick, it'll stop.

361
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,310
You can do better than that.

362
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,980
Oh, really?

363
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,920
All right.

364
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,660
Shit!

365
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,590
Did I fix it?

366
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,960
I don't know.

367
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,390
Did you?

368
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,280
Jesus!

369
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,820
Shit! That's an actual body!

370
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,720
That's an actual body.

371
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,030
Okay, okay, okay.

372
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,990
That's a dead person for real.

373
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,110
Put your fucking hands down.

374
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,990
Sorry.

375
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,070
Ugh, accepting a ride from strangers

376
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,120
is always such a bad idea.

377
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,360
So, uh...

378
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,630
did you kill this guy?

379
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,940
Well, he wasn't dead a minute ago.

380
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,400
If he is now, then technically

381
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,580
you killed him.

382
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,410
Are you, uh, are you a hitman

383
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,080
or something, or...

384
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,030
Jesus Christ, man.

385
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,680
You can't just kill people!

386
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,500
Course you can.

387
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,410
Oh shit!

388
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,960
Oh shit, man!

389
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,120
I was just on VentureBeat's list of 40 under 40,

390
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,820
I can't die like this!

391
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,960
Okay, what's your name?

392
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,990
It's Jack, right?

393
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,630
And what do you do, Jack?

394
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,400
Uh, I'm an artist.

395
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,540
I have a trust fund, okay?

396
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,480
Please!

397
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,060
And would you define yourself as "Sane"?

398
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,990
I...I...

399
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,270
Anything you do other than

400
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,900
eat, sleep, shit, fuck, and kill

401
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,840
is a symptom of insanity.

402
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,200
You see, there was a point

403
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,170
during human evolution where something,

404
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,930
some neuron pathway misfired,

405
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,420
and we all became self-ware.

406
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,580
That is to say, we became insane.

407
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,620
We are balls of flesh and bone

408
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,290
on a rock of ice

409
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,880
spinning through a dark, random universe

410
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,470
designed only to survive,

411
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,130
but then something happened in our DNA

412
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,940
where we went, "Hey, wait, wait, wait.

413
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,000
What if I matter?

414
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,970
What if it's all about me?"

415
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,500
Did you ever watch those, um...

416
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,590
the David Attenborough shows?

418
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,580
They're magnificent, right?

419
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,890
Full of death.

420
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,000
And yet in a way, it makes sense.

421
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,990
And then you try and watch the news and it's crazy.

422
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,430
There's no sense at all.

423
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,430
And I will answer that other question for you.

424
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,140
Does a crazy person know they're crazy?

425
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,060
Yes, it's called a conscience.

426
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,850
Jiminy Cricket,

427
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,020
that's just the part of our brains

428
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,360
screaming at the psychic tear

429
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,510
caused by the gulf between what we are

430
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,640
and what we pretend to be.

431
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,130
You think the world needs your doodles, artist?

432
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,420
There's no art in the natural world.

433
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,900
There is murder.

434
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,200
Do you really think

435
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,710
it made a difference to the world

436
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,980
if he lived or died?

437
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,360
That was the most amazing thing i've ever heard.

438
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,510
Do you know how often

439
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,590
I've wanted to do that to somebody?

440
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,410
That's a...

441
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,540
Car keys, now.

442
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,170
Jack, he's gonna fucking kill us.

443
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:38,930
He is right.

444
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,960
He is right.

445
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,900
However, if you agree to help me,

446
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,850
I promise I'll make it quick.

447
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,880
Top drawer.

448
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,620
You.

449
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,970
Close the drawer.

450
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,120
What the hell was that?

451
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,270
I rigged it as an escape route.

452
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,430
I thought it would be a fun way to impress girls.

453
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,130
That is so rapey.

454
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,650
Oh my God!

455
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,960
Go, go, go, go.

456
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,980
- Jack, Jack, what are you - Jack!

457
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,840
Stop, stop the music!

458
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,460
Please, somebody call the police!

459
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,610
One of my guests is trying to kill us!

460
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,090
What the fuck?

461
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,070
Come on!

462
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,070
Jesus Christ.

463
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,950
Go, go, go.

464
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,970
I didn't know about the drawer, I swear.

465
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,340
What's wrong with you?

466
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,300
I know Jack.

467
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,930
If there's a shortcut way out of this room,

468
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,150
it's gonna be revealed by some smug, nerdy

469
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,660
inside joke onanism.

470
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,590
I can figure it out.

471
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,890
Thank you.

472
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,540
Hurry up, come on!

473
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,030
Guys, what the hell are we doing, huh?

474
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,710
But why did we take this thing?

475
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,180
Dude, this thing is a person.

476
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,970
Dude, there's probably a reward out on this guy.

477
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,190
- What? - What?

478
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,400
There's always a reward when you turn in a murderer.

479
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,950
They're gonna give us a pile of money.

480
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,140
Everyone's gonna love us.

481
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,840
We're gonna be heroes!

482
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,100
Oh my, what are you,

483
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,640
Dog the Bounty Hunter?

484
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,060
Is that not why you picked it up?

485
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,860
Uh, it is not an it,

486
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,820
it is a person

487
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,900
that might still be alive.

488
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,630
Yeah, but that guy's gonna want him - back.

489
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,780
Wait.

490
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,720
Why is this suddenly our problem?

491
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,020
Okay.

492
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,620
We're gonna give him to the cops

493
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,340
and then he stops being our problem. Okay?

494
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,810
Jack, keys?

495
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,800
What?

496
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,810
You were giving that guy a ride.

497
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,670
Yeah, but he went all psycho

498
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,180
before I could grab the keys.

499
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,910
Then why the fuck are we down here?

500
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,930
I thought you guys drove!

501
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,850
Oh my God!

502
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,160
Nick drove us, you jackass.

503
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,570
He parked three blocks away.

504
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,160
Okay, so where are his keys?

505
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,020
Aw, shit.

506
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,880
He wasn't wrong about you, was he?

507
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,550
You are a hitman, right?

508
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,250
Could be in here for a really long time, you know?

509
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,450
- Dude, Uber, right? - Yes.

510
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,890
- Yes. - Are you kidding me?

511
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,230
Call 911.

512
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,700
Okay, uh...

513
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,830
Shit, I left my phone upstairs.

514
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,050
Oh my God, okay, fine.

515
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,910
I'll get the car.

516
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,670
No one is gonna let us

517
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,940
get into the car with a body.

518
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,890
No, no, they can be heroes with us.

519
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,170
Are you serious?

520
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,160
Look, call the cops.

521
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,860
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

522
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,610
When we came in here,

523
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,600
there were cops outside.

524
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,430
Uh, yes, uh, go, go now.

525
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,170
Go.

526
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,270
What did you say you wanted, Randy?

527
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,680
A cinnamon raisin bagel, toasted, half butter--half

528
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,750
otherwise it gets all drippy.

529
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,310
Two creams, two sugars in the coffee.

530
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,640
Oh, what the hell is this?

531
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,540
Central, this is Unit 1-Alpha-7-8.

532
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,490
Think I got another drunk and disorderly.

533
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,290
He's possibly on drugs.

534
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,740
- Please! - Definitely on drugs.

535
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,750
Please, I need you.

536
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,250
Hey, what the hell are you doin'?

537
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,360
Jesus Christ, I'm so happy to see you.

538
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,660
Step back from the window.

539
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,470
Now.

540
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,240
Sir, um,

541
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,700
my friends, they're down there,

542
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,100
and in the building over there.

543
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,710
We--we need--we need you to come.

544
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,170
I need you to come with me, please.

545
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,310
Hey West, I got a couple of drunks to deal with.

546
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,460
You need me to come back?

547
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,390
Nah, I got it.

548
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,970
All right, son.

549
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,070
Show me.

550
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,910
Come on, come on, come on!

551
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,400
Please hurry up, come on!

552
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,520
He's coming back!

553
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,490
Okay.

554
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,660
No...

555
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,870
Count of Monte Cristo.

556
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,210
Classic prison escape scene.

557
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,720
Code is probably the release date

558
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,210
for The Exorcist or THX1138 or...

559
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,060
We work pretty well together.

560
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,470
There is no "We."

561
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,200
Guys!

562
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,530
Guys!

563
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,220
- Oh, yes! - Yes, yes, yes!

564
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,730
Yes!

565
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,080
Oh, thank God.

566
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,540
Come on, guys.

567
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,970
Look, I know it's Halloween and everything,

568
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,600
but you could really scare the hell

569
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,830
out of somebody with this thing.

570
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,700
Oh, no, no, please, uh, we need your help.

571
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,260
Stay where you are, miss.

572
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,010
Uh, officer, please

573
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,880
Hey, stay where you are!

574
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,630
No, no, no, please,

575
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,680
you don't understand.

576
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,820
Command, I got a code 6A,

577
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,230
three intoxicated persons, one hysterical female.

578
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,860
You fucking asshole!

579
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,850
Stand down!

580
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,070
Female is possibly armed.

581
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,610
Stand down from what, you fucking moron?

582
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,430
Someone is dead here

583
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,020
and we need your help.

584
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, okay.

585
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,010
It's gettin' away from us here.

586
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,110
I know this doesn't look good.

587
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,890
Just listen to me. My name is Alan Morgan Adams.

588
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,100
Of the Massachusetts Morgan Adamses.

589
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,450
Okay, uh, we are not the ones you're looking for.

590
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,280
He is going to be here any fucking second,

591
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,020
No, freeze right now!

592
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,930
No, wait!

593
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,760
Look, it's a real person.

594
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,370
Wait, is that who I think it is?

595
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,260
He's famous.

596
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,640
And rich.

597
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,500
And beautiful.

598
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,820
All right, so wait, just walk

599
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,100
walk me through all this again.

600
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,830
No, no, you need to call for backup right now

601
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,900
or we are all going to die.

602
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,290
You tell me who did this.

603
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,780
Guys.

604
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
He did it.

605
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,470
Hey you, stop right there!

606
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,700
- Oh, shit. - Freeze!

607
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,830
Just shoot the bastard!

608
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,840
Miss, you stay back,

609
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,240
you let me take care of this.

610
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,130
Now this is your last warning.

611
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,910
What are you doing?

612
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,130
Do you really think Chief Wiggum's

613
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,370
gonna save the day?

614
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,840
Good point.

615
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,430
Put your hands where I can see them.

616
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,330
I said put your hands up!

617
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,750
Ooh, wait.

618
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,760
Oh God...

619
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,110
Hey, stop!

620
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,170
Come on, stop!

621
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,910
Don't go anywhere!

622
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,070
You stop right now!

623
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,390
What the hell!

624
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,570
I...

625
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,580
Hey Randy.

626
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,570
They're out of cinnamon raisin, buddy.

627
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,270
Can you believe that?

628
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,110
You're a murderer, they're thieves,

629
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,410
I'm the one who gets shot.

630
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,040
Okay, I can find them.

631
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,460
I just need a computer.

632
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,610
If they have a cell phone,

633
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,580
I can track them.

634
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,100
A flesh wound.

635
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,280
Talk and walk.

636
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,670
Guys, what the fuck are we gonna do now?

637
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,560
Oh my God, I've never been

638
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,370
this close to a famous person before.

639
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,530
Dude, put that thing down, man!

640
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,780
No, we're not putting him down!

641
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,430
Are you kidding me?

642
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,440
You guys know who this is

643
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,880
and we get to be the ones that rescued him.

644
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,740
Wait a second.

645
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,900
Hey, you know what?

646
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,080
We're not rescuing him

647
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,750
because he's dead!

648
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,720
Okay, whatever.

649
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,270
We need to get off the street, okay?

650
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,130
And why couldn't he just kill,

651
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,720
like, Elijah Wood or someone small?

652
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,900
We could just take that.

653
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,380
Yeah, you want to rip off a homeless guy?

654
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,140
Do you want to shoot a puppy

655
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,040
while we're at it too, hmm?

656
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,300
Oh, I'm sorry, would you rather

657
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,790
that the fucking psychopath catches up with us, Dot?

658
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,880
- Okay, okay. - That's right.

659
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,520
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Thank you.

660
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,790
Yep, right, right, right.

661
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,850
Hi, we just need to borrow this.

662
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,070
Over my dead...

663
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,400
body.

664
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,540
Yeah, that, that exactly, yes, um...

665
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,520
Uh, that's good enough, right?

666
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,620
Yup.

667
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,390
So sorry, we're gonna take really good care of it.

668
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,090
Thanks so much.

669
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,010
Nice to meet you.

670
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,320
Hey, I know homelessness is a complex issue

671
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,810
that can't be solved by charity alone,

672
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,910
so I, uh, I hope this helps the situation just a little.

673
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,070
Sorry, man.

674
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,860
Thank you.

675
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,500
God bless you.

676
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,720
Jack, come on!

680
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,090
You're very calm

681
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,330
for someone who's just lost

682
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,120
the bodily evidence that he's a murderer.

683
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,010
Yes, remind me how that happened again.

684
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,910
This might come in handy.

685
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,060
Just doing what you said.

686
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,360
New evidence, new culprits,

687
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,520
new narrative, right?

688
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,520
Could you...

689
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,650
could you just take that jumpsuit off?

690
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,460
- Wait, what, out here? - Yes, yes.

691
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,380
We need somebody to help us, you guys.

692
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,230
We're trying to be discreet, okay,

693
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,430
and he can see you from a mile off with that, so...

694
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,610
I could be naked under this.

695
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,620
Is that discreet?

696
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,220
Hey, dude,

697
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,440
why are you texting me right now?

698
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,740
I'm not, I don't have my phone.

699
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,910
Then what's...

700
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,890
Oh no.

701
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,470
Alan?

703
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,490
Wait, is that the cop?

704
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,340
Oh shit.

705
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,270
Dude, he has your fucking phone.

706
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,270
That's bad, right?

707
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,410
Wait, I don't get it, why is...

708
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,040
I--I don't know,

709
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,270
but I feel like that can't be good.

710
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,200
There's, like, emojis.

711
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,570
Are you kidding me?

712
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,830
He is framing us, hello!

713
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,650
Fuck!

714
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,300
- Fuck, fuck! - Shit!

715
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,310
That's exactly what he's doing.

716
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,130
Fuck me!

717
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,710
Oh God, oh my God.

718
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,830
Fucking be kidding me.

719
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,050
Fuck my life, shit!

720
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,770
Fuck that shit, man!

721
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,990
Okay, this can't be happening right now.

722
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,160
He doesn't know where we are.

723
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,040
- That's true. - Right?

724
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,750
That's a good point.

725
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,810
We can ditch the dead guy

726
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,010
and just go our separate ways.

727
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,790
We can leave it anywhere.

728
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,500
No, that is not a good idea.

729
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,660
He killed Nick, and you stomped on this fucking guy's head.

730
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,030
I am not the one

731
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,460
who fuckin' brought that lunatic into my house.

732
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,920
Okay, that costume was amazing.

733
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,350
- It wasn't a costume! - It wasn't a costume!

734
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,250
Oh my God, oh my God, it was Halloween!

735
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,280
How was I supposed to know?

736
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,490
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

737
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,040
Okay, that dead cop

738
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,240
took my name, man.

739
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,720
He radioed in about us.

740
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,600
You know why?

741
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,300
Because you're always throwing your name around.

742
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,940
Oh, look, you dropped something.

743
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,460
Your fuckin' name.

744
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,370
Oh, yeah, that's my fault.

745
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,400
That's on me, okay.

746
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,350
Oh yeah, it is.

747
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,060
You know what?

748
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,290
Good luck with it.

749
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,830
I'm fuckin' done.

750
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,590
- I'm out. - You're done?

751
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,560
Oh, you're gonna go?

752
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,090
You're gonna walk away from here?

753
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,290
Oh, this is really something coming from you.

754
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,480
Hey, by the way, quick question.

755
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,130
How you doin' with the very first problem

756
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,860
in your entire life

757
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,490
that you couldn't just throw money at, huh?

758
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,630
How's that goin' for you?

759
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,450
You didn't mind my money

760
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,380
when you were hooverin' up my fuckin' drugs, right?

761
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,460
Oh yeah,

762
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,610
and you were pitchin' me

763
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,630
your stupid fuckin' apps.

764
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,870
My stupid fucking apps?

765
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,940
Shut the fuck up,

766
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,750
both of you, oh my God!

767
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,520
Nick, Nick is dead in your studio.

768
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,980
The cop, dead in your garage.

769
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,030
There's photos on both of your phones.

770
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,340
All right, maybe if...

771
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,360
maybe if we just give the body back,

772
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,090
and I'll say sorry.

773
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,730
Oh, wake up!

774
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,380
We know nothing about this guy.

775
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,240
He has our names, your address.

776
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,790
I mean, Alan gave him his fucking résumé.

777
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,590
Okay, we don't need to keep putting each other down, you guys.

778
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,920
Okay, that psycho, he wore gloves.

779
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,690
Our prints are all over it.

780
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,540
He's gonna kill us

781
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,470
whether or not we have this thing.

782
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,450
It's a person.

783
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,060
Fuck all that noise, okay?

784
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,410
And the cops, when the cops come looking for us,

785
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,460
they're gonna shoot me,

786
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,400
and then he's gonna lock you both up.

787
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,210
Do you want to risk that,

788
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,980
is that what you want to do?

789
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,630
What the fuck do we do?

790
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,290
We make it go away.

791
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,980
No body, no evidence.

792
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,050
We gotta bleach him.

793
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,710
Pulverize the teeth.

794
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,130
Burn off the fingerprints.

795
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,550
We disfigure the face.

796
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,740
We melt him down.

797
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,970
We drain the blood and the bodily fluids.

798
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,120
We mix those with bleach.

799
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,350
We also bleach the inside.

800
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,130
We chop him into pieces small enough

801
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,570
that they can't be recognized as human

802
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,960
in case somebody finds one of 'em.

803
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,730
Vinegar to soften the bones.

804
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,840
We put each part in a different plastic bag,

805
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,440
fill 'em with lye, tie the tops, and we bury them

806
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,380
as far away from each other as possible.

807
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,590
Uh, that is why you're single.

808
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,630
Oh, okay.

809
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm the only one of us that watched Breaking Bad?

810
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,490
Are you kidding me?

811
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,180
That show redefined television.

812
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,250
Okay, uh...

813
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,910
where exactly are we meant to do all this?

814
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,830
I don't know, but you know what?

815
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,210
Not here, so let's...let's just go.

816
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,560
Let's go, yeah.

817
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,900
Oh, okay, no, I'll get it.

818
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,950
Thanks, guys, thanks for all of your help.

819
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,680
Appreciate it.

820
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,890
You dumb dicks.

821
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,060
Son of a bitch.

822
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,540
Why do you have a gun?

823
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,400
Why wouldn't I?

824
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,130
What if I go to the movies

825
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,830
or my local Planned Parenthood

826
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,720
and some asshole comes in with a gun to shoot everyone?

827
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,130
Nobody would've gotten hurt tonight

828
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,400
if everybody had a gun.

829
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,070
I work long hours,

830
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,240
I go running early.

831
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,020
It makes me feel safer.

832
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,350
Have you ever had to use it?

833
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,180
I just killed two people right in front of you.

834
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,440
I know, who's gonna be next?

835
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,010
You're not grasping the reality of what I'm saying.

836
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,230
I kill people.

837
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,720
You haven't killed me.

838
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Come on.

839
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,770
Let's get you cleaned up.

840
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,800
*No one knows who I am*

841
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,800
*No one knows who I am*

842
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,970
*Nobody recognizes me*

843
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:29,220
*No one knows who I'm supposed to be*

844
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,310
*For Halloween*

845
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,560
Dalmore neat, and a slightly burnt, perfect,

846
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,070
Sipsmith and Cokey martini,

847
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,420
straight up with a twist,

848
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,410
12 year Coal Ila for the scotch.

849
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,270
What?

850
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,970
A drink order shouldn't have 25 words in it.

851
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,330
Look at these two.

852
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,810
Hold that for a sec.

853
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,410
Uh, I'm gonna go...

854
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,030
take care of this.

855
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,680
That booth when you get back.

856
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:15,390
*This year for Halloween*

857
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,280
*I'll just be me*

858
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,180
Thank you.

860
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,830
Maggie, what are you doing?

861
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,650
Is this crazy?

862
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,560
No.

863
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,870
You don't meet guys like this every day.

864
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,420
He's...he's smart, he's strong,

865
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,050
he's employed.

866
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,540
He can handle you.

867
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,130
Timing's a bit off, but that's okay.

868
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,010
Grow through conflict.

870
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah, yeah, this is it.

871
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,290
All right, what now?

872
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,040
Uh, well, padlock is shit,

873
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,980
and we need what's in there, so.

874
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,690
Never paid for a bike in my life.

875
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,990
Okay, let's do this.

876
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,600
So this doesn't feel like much of a plan.

877
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,460
You said you could track him with a computer.

878
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,000
Can you get into this?

879
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,190
I'm a data engineer, not a hacker.

880
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,880
Yes.

881
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,470
Just take me a minute to get around this guy's password.

882
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,720
I'm gonna find those assholes for you.

883
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,610
What?

884
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,640
Is this everything?

885
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,280
I guess we're about to find out.

886
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:44,950
Seriously?

887
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,850
Don't deny me this, Dorothy.

888
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,690
Tonight isn't really what I was expecting, okay?

889
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,010
So, yeah,

890
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,230
I want a machete.

891
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,610
All right.

892
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,400
It says we start with the face.

893
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,470
I still can't believe it's him.

894
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,330
I know.

895
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,770
Doesn't he have like 20 million Twitter followers?

896
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:14,720
Not anymore.

897
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,290
Okay.

898
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,530
I'm in.

899
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,220
You can track pretty much anybody's smartphone

900
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,410
as long as a single one of their apps

901
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,290
has live location in the background.

902
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,700
Code's running.

903
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,320
So I gotta say,

904
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,800
seeing you do what you do,

905
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,880
hearing you talk.

906
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,420
Suddenly so much makes sense.

907
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,580
How?

908
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,820
I'll answer one of yours

909
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,710
for each one you answer of mine.

910
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,930
Come on.

911
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,980
All the secrets, the deceptions.

912
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,220
You must be dying to just talk straight to someone.

913
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:00,920
Why are you here?

914
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,940
Because I wanna be.

915
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,380
Why?

916
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,430
My turn.

917
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:06,870
Who paid you?

918
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,630
I don't know.

919
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,230
I never meet him.

920
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,600
Do you know what the dark web is?

921
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,510
Yes.

922
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,710
The part of the internet that's encrypted and untraceable...

923
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,900
where you would go if you want someone killed.

924
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,470
It's one of the many places you can go to do that, yes.

925
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,910
The visible world is so bright and reassuring,

926
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,590
but it needs the dark.

927
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,690
The man who pays me owns the dark.

928
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,900
You don't know him, he doesn't know you.

929
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,730
You get paid in electronic currency.

930
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,280
Completely anonymous.

931
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,440
How much did you get for the guy in the bag?

932
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,030
More than anyone, ever.

933
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,720
And I thought you were hot

934
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,350
before I knew you were rich.

935
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,830
Your turn.

936
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,300
Do you know why I like Halloween, Maggie?

937
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,550
The candy?

938
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,720
People.

939
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,320
They wear masks their whole lives,

940
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,790
pretending that life has meaning.

941
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,760
When you kill somebody,

942
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,930
all of that's gone.

943
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,520
Halloween is the closest people come to admitting

944
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,970
that we are defined by death.

945
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,890
How do you come to do what you do?

946
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,320
Choose a job you love,

947
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,010
you never have to work a day in your life.

948
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,570
I want that choice.

949
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,810
Life carries most people along.

950
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,740
So much happens,

951
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,760
so little is made to happen.

952
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,830
But life is consequence.

953
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,800
You throw a glass, it breaks.

954
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,910
You cut someone, they bleed.

955
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,010
You kill someone, they're gone.

956
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,370
I was always taught that consequences are to be feared.

957
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,330
Every decision I make,

958
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,070
every second of my life

959
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,710
is based on what someone else wants or needs,

960
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:17,670
it's like a fucking straitjacket.

961
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,990
And then there's you,

962
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,960
saying consequences are proof of power.

963
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,400
You can do anything you want.

964
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,870
All of it's good, do it.

965
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,990
Because none of it means anything.

966
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,600
Was it hard

967
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,490
to kill someone the first time?

968
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,690
Maggie...

969
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,750
None of it's hard.

970
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,750
Dead cops aren't good for business.

971
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,800
Find them.

972
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,510
There was a complication.

973
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:14,920
Small.

974
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,180
So?

975
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,220
So nothing.

976
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,540
I've got it under control.

977
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,310
This isn't like you, Wilkes.

978
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,720
One complicated night in a decade

979
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,430
isn't a bad track record.

980
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,300
I hope you know where my body is.

981
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,240
You're watching me.

982
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,210
Maybe.

983
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,160
On and off.

984
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,260
That wasn't part of the deal.

985
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,670
Neither is lying to me.

986
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,850
Even great white sharks have their predators, Wilkes.

987
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,370
Two hours.

988
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,700
Sort your mess out.

989
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,960
Don't let me down.

990
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,690
Fuck me!

991
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,360
Don't touch your face, Jack.

992
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,670
It's basically acid.

993
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,170
Okay.

994
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,080
What's next?

995
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,990
Burn off his fingerprints.

996
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,390
You, it's your turn.

997
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,050
Now.

998
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,260
Okay.

999
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,720
Okay.

1000
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:41,930
Oh, shit.

1001
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,200
The skin is coming off!

1002
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,620
- Oh, God. - Fuck, ahh!

1003
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,950
Okay, ahh!

1004
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,760
Oh, fuck.

1005
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,890
He's leaking.

1006
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,930
He's leaking, he's leaking. Okay.

1007
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,130
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1008
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,050
Why isn't Alan doing any of this gross shit, huh?

1009
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,920
He's the one that got us into this mess.

1010
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,630
Hey! One of us has to keep our eye

1011
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,220
on the bigger picture, okay?

1012
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,660
I will look up the instructions,

1013
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,320
and you two carry them out.

1014
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,280
Thank you.

1015
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,330
Chop, chop.

1016
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,390
We need to find that body, now.

1017
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,190
You said "We."

1018
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,470
Okay, this is them.

1019
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,650
They're at a hardware store 10 blocks from here.

1020
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,310
Alan is doing a Google search.

1021
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,630
Trying to destroy a body,

1022
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:44,920
by the looks of it.

1023
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,600
Now I can tap into any camera in the area

1024
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,370
with a built-in sensor or actuator.

1025
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,270
There they are.

1026
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,650
Is this live?

1027
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,800
It was 10 minutes ago.

1028
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,930
If I connect Alan and Jack using Find My Friends,

1029
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,530
we can track them with Jack's phone.

1030
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,960
Body cam footage is instantly uploaded to a cloud server.

1031
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,780
Can you access that server?

1032
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,710
It'll be traceable to this computer.

1033
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:18,220
I'm okay with that.

1034
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,180
Me too.

1035
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,700
Find the video we're in and delete it.

1036
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,350
We should send it to them.

1037
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:32,520
We've already sent the photos.

1038
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,750
Let's have a little fun.

1039
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,470
Hey, Officer.

1040
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,600
Trick or treat, motherfucker.

1041
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,330
Yeah, what's up, boy?

1042
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,840
You guys look great.

1043
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,610
Dunder Mifflin for the win!

1044
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,990
Oh, shit.

1045
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh, shit, get over here.

1046
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,050
Guys.

1047
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,190
Look, we have a dead body here.

1048
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:44,830
We need your help.

1049
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,770
Someone has been murdered.

1050
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,150
Okay, okay, it's gettin' away from us here.

1051
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,610
This isn't what it looks like, Officer.

1052
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,000
Just listen to me, my name is Alan Morgan Adams.

1053
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,820
What is this guy's problem?

1054
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,090
Oh, my God!

1055
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,180
Oh, my God.

1056
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,590
Oh, my God, oh my God.

1057
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,400
- What do we do? - Focus, focus, focus.

1058
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,590
No, what do we do, what do we do?

1059
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,920
There is no footage of us killing the cop

1060
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,820
because we didn't actually do it.

1061
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,250
He's just trying to freak us out.

1062
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,040
He's trying to make us crack,

1063
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,110
that is all he's doing.

1064
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,130
- Oh, my God. - Yeah, well, it's working.

1065
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,760
I'm cracked.

1066
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,890
Alan, I need you to log on to Jack's Apple account,

1067
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:18,940
Find My iPhone,

1068
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,370
and then delete all the messages.

1069
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,250
That's it.

1070
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,850
Wait, how do I do any of that?

1071
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:25,660
Are you kidding me?

1072
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,810
You do it then, Jack!

1073
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,640
- I don't know how! - Exactly!

1074
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,080
I pay nerds to do that for me.

1075
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,100
All right?

1076
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,300
Maggie.

1077
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,410
Maggie's helping him.

1078
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,390
Oh, wait, the blonde that was with him tonight?

1079
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,300
Yeah, the one that was dressed as, um...

1080
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,310
uh, Elsa from Frozen.

1081
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,200
Marie Antoinette, you dipshit!

1082
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,340
Do you know anything about anything

1083
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,230
that's not been made into an action figure?

1084
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,960
I'm so sorry, professor.

1085
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,110
I'm not an expert in Civil War history, okay?

1086
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,040
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1087
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,080
hold on, you guys, it says here

1088
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,260
the lye is gonna take like hours to work.

1089
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,170
Oh, shit. We have to heat it

1090
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,650
to almost a thousand degrees?

1091
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,200
You didn't think to tell us that before we started?

1092
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,990
You could've looked it up your fucking self, Dot!

1093
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,560
Call me Dot one more fucking time.

1094
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,480
What you gonna do?

1095
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,740
- Do something. - I surrender and I let go,

1096
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,750
I surrender and I let go.

1097
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,860
Do that.

1098
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,200
It says here we could also

1099
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,960
burn the entire body, that would work.

1100
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,720
What website are you on?

1101
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,770
Wikipedia.

1102
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,910
What?

1103
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,930
Okay, you know what,

1104
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:27,050
it's not as if we can start a fire in here anyway, so.

1105
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,280
Oh, yeah, actually, never mind

1106
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,290
because it has to be hot enough

1107
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,150
to turn him into ash,

1108
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,090
not just a bubbly stew person.

1109
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,480
That's great.

1110
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,690
So...

1111
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,630
Hospitals, clinics, mortuaries,

1112
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,120
they...they have incinerators.

1113
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,690
My mom, she used to work at a hospital,

1114
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,950
and they'd also discard

1115
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:46,040
like the old placentas and the foreskins and stuff,

1116
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,880
they burn them at the end of the night.

1117
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,060
Right, right, right, right, right, okay.

1118
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,170
I can work with that.

1119
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,610
Is the real world too gory for you, Monster Maker?

1120
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,730
Yes.

1121
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,640
Yes, it is, actually.

1122
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,150
- That's the whole point. - Hold on.

1123
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,680
Would a funeral home work?

1124
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,630
There's one on Hooper Street.

1125
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,320
Yes, yeah, that's perfect.

1126
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,980
Uh, I don't know about that, Dot.

1127
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:05,890
Rothy.

1128
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,150
Uh, think about it.

1129
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,800
We already broke into this building.

1130
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,210
Now you want us to break into other buildings?

1131
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,740
There's...there's more bodies.

1132
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,410
Yes!

1133
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,700
The faster that we feed this fucker to the incinerator,

1134
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,390
the faster that this is done.

1135
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,710
We take your trust fund money,

1136
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,200
we buy plane tickets to Jamaica,

1137
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,870
and we spend the rest of our miserable year drinking mojitos

1138
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,510
and having threesomes on the beach.

1139
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,080
Okay, yeah.

1140
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,900
Lead us to a funeral home.

1141
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,170
Okay, great.

1142
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,580
Clear your browser history,

1143
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,330
put him back in the cart.

1144
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,880
You, clean this shit up.

1145
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,640
You know neither one of us

1146
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,970
is gonna be in that threesome, right?

1147
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,120
Yeah, I know.

1148
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,800
- Now! - Yeah, okay.

1149
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,790
Ah, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1150
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,120
Come on, let's cut through here.

1151
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,200
Can you hurry up?

1152
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,880
I don't understand you,

1153
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,290
but I feel like you might be the first person I've met

1154
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,780
in a very long time...

1155
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,490
that understands me.

1156
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,890
After you kill them,

1157
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,770
after tonight,

1158
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:44,510
you can teach me some things.

1159
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,270
I can teach you some things.

1160
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,000
We can be together,

1161
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:51,420
just the two of us,

1162
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,070
doing anything we want.

1163
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,980
There is no "We."

1165
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,660
This is it.

1166
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,050
Let's do this.

1167
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,500
Can I help you, ma'am?

1168
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,420
Um, hi, yes,

1169
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:36,280
we need your help.

1170
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,790
We have a dead body, and there's this guy,

1171
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,470
and he's trying to kill us--

1172
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,010
Please press the button

1173
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,330
before speaking, ma'am.

1174
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:42,040
Oh, my God!

1175
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,710
We have a dead body, someone is trying to kill us.

1176
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,440
Open the fucking door!

1177
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,370
Come, come.

1178
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:57,790
Is that--

1179
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,310
Yeah, yes, yes.

1180
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:00,600
Well, shit.

1181
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,800
Where are his goddamn teeth?

1182
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,320
Oh, my God, why does everyone keep pulling guns on us?

1183
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,170
We don't got time for this, all right?

1184
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,080
He's gonna kill us.

1185
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,000
Who?

1186
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,250
Oh, shit, I knew that was gonna happen!

1187
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,790
- Get in! - I'm coming!

1188
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,950
No. No.

1189
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:37,830
No, no.

1190
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,530
No!

1191
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,260
I'm sorry, guys.

1192
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:42,520
I can't fuckin' do this.

1193
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:43,760
I am out!

1194
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,110
What?

1195
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,110
Come back, you asshole!

1196
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,590
Jack! Fuck!

1197
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:50,990
Okay.

1198
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,020
- Where'd he go? - I don't know.

1199
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,980
God, what is my deal?

1200
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,260
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

1201
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:04,840
I'm sorry I got us into this.

1202
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,820
I'm sorry I'm always up in everyone's face,

1203
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,000
I'm always pressuring people into doing shit.

1204
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,360
I'm sorry I can never stop running my fucking mouth.

1205
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,810
Calm down, it's fine.

1206
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,120
Um, what the--

1207
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,530
what the fuck are you doing?

1208
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,180
Somebody's trying to kill us right now.

1209
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,390
- Are you-- - Right, no, I--

1210
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,150
Fuck you. Go.

1211
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:28,750
Go to the incinerator please.

1212
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,660
Yeah, okay.

1213
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,050
Wait, what am I supposed to do once I find it?

1214
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,100
It's an oven, Alan.

1215
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,510
Do you know how to turn on an oven?

1216
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:38,810
Okay.

1217
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,370
Where the fuck are you?

1218
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:57,950
Fuck.

1219
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,950
Good luck getting in here.

1220
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,260
Fuck!

1221
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,650
Shit.

1222
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,980
Shit.

1223
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,150
What is wrong with you?

1224
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,180
Keep it together.

1225
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:25,680
You fuckin' pussy.

1226
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,790
You got this.

1227
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:31,660
You got this.

1228
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,550
Jack!

1229
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,130
Alan!

1230
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:09,760
Seriously, that's all you have?

1231
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,240
It was all I could find, Dorothy.

1232
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,980
Oh, my God, you scared the shit outta me.

1233
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,460
Is this it, this is it?

1234
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,960
Yeah, it's gonna take a minute to heat up.

1235
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,280
We don't have a minute, Alan.

1236
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,780
The son of a bitch is in the building.

1237
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,140
- What? - Yeah.

1238
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:20,930
Are you serious?

1239
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,370
It has to get to like 1400 degrees or it's not gonna work.

1240
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,690
Oh, my God.

1241
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,830
Oh, my God, we're gonna die tonight.

1242
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,180
We're gonna die tonight.

1243
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,280
We're gonna fucking die tonight.

1244
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,140
No, no, okay, don't check out on me now.

1245
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,110
Just get this thing going,

1246
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:32,950
I have an idea.

1247
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,020
Oh, fuck.

1248
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,490
Shit.

1249
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:11,470
Please, God.

1250
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,590
Please let me live.

1251
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,430
Please, little sweet baby Jesus.

1252
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,740
Please let me live.

1253
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,640
I'll give all my money to kids.

1254
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:22,980
I promise.

1255
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:25,800
I'll live my life like it's Christmas every day.

1256
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,470
I'll live my life in the past, the present, and the future.

1257
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:32,000
I will never do any drugs,

1258
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,450
and I won't disrespect women.

1259
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,590
Oh please, sweet Jesus, let me live.

1260
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,990
Okay, okay.

1261
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:57,700
No, no!

1262
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,580
Shit.

1263
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:25,810
Don't worry.

1264
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,060
I'm just gonna take the body,

1265
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,020
and then you can go home.

1266
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,000
I'm sor--

1267
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:41,040
I am so sorry,

1268
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,960
I really did think I could do that with a straight face there.

1269
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,120
Where's the girl?

1270
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,080
Okay.

1271
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:03,750
Careful now.

1272
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:04,610
You don't want to miss me

1273
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,170
and hit your boyfriend there.

1274
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,860
Fucking shoot him!

1275
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,990
Fucking hold him still!

1276
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,140
Fuck!

1277
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,430
Find the goddamn gun!

1278
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,650
I can't reach it!

1279
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,180
I got it.

1280
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:18,920
This is what death looks like, boy.

1281
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,530
I hope that one drink was worth it.

1282
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,070
How does death look now, asshole?

1283
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,860
Jesus Christ.

1284
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,430
I only asked you to deliver him.

1285
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,490
You said you wanted to make a statement.

1286
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,510
There's your statement.

1287
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,380
The money is transferred.

1288
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:07,690
I trust if you're satisfied

1289
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:11,260
we can put tonight's... difficulties behind us.

1290
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,170
Have all the complications been dealt with?

1291
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,230
No loose ends.

1292
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,200
You hear that BS?

1293
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,000
The phone is dead.

1294
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:52,950
Even the phone is dead!

1295
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,290
I killed you.

1296
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,060
Hell is empty,

1297
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,030
and all the devils are here.

1298
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,670
I just wanted a little bit of what you had.

1299
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,530
But I'm a fast learner.

1300
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,940
Stabbing me wasn't very nice.

1301
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:16,540
Maggie!

1302
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,920
But can I tell you a secret?

1303
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:23,520
I'm so happy to be rid of any delusions.

1304
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,810
No, no.

1305
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,510
Costume.

1306
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,810
Amazeballs.
