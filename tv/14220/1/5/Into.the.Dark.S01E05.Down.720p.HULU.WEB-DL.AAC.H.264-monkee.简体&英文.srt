It's like the perfect storm, right?

39
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
你太客气了
You shouldn't have.

40
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,580
是啊  忍不住嘛
Oh, well, you know, couldn't help myself.

我们是停下了吗
Did we just stop?

51
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,410

你要按下警报吗
You wanna hit the alarm?

60
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,100
不就是干这个用的吗
I mean, that's what it's there for, isn't it?

61
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,000
好吧
Yeah, I...

62
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,080

Okay, I'm just gonna hit it.

63
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,080
没反应
Nada.

64
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,160
那个不是应该嗡鸣的吗
That supposed to, like, buzz or something?

65
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,550
我不知道
I don't know.

66
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,590
现在是毫无反应
They're not doing anything.

67
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,680
喂
Hello?

68
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,140
喂  我们被困在了电梯里
Hello, we're stuck in the elevator.

69
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,070
天呐
Oh, God.

70
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,440
我不知道  似乎是...
I mean, I don't know, looks like something is, uh...

71
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,850
肯定是电力问题
Must be something electrical or something.

72
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,100
这怎么可能
How's that even possible?

73
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,360
灯还亮着  电视屏也是
The lights are still on and so's the TV screen.

74
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,950
嗯
Yeah.

75
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,120
我们应该挺接近
I think we're pretty close to the, uh...

76
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,130
好吧  不行的
Yup, that's not gonna work.

77
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,050
看来我是没有超人力量了
So much for my superhuman strength.

78
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,450
看  有摄像头
Oh look, there's a camera.

79
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,340

But mine rarely works in elevators, you know,

90

或许我们就安静等会儿
I mean, maybe we just wait a minute or two

94
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,850
肯定有人在解决呢
and I'm sure someone's working on it.

95
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,110
希望如此
God, I hope so.

96

我真的不想在这里困到周二早上
I'd rather not be stuck here till Tuesday morning.

Are you claustrophobic?

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,930
反正不太喜欢被困在狭小空间里
I'm not not claustrophobic.

00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,380
你要完全上来啊
Oh, you're going all the way.

156
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,470
-嗯  准备好了吗  -好
- Yup, ready? - Okay.

157
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,220
-等等  行吗  -没问题
- Wait, ready? - No, I got it, I got it.

158
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,440
-没问题  -抱歉
- You're good. - Sorry.

159
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,510
-行的  准备好了  -嗯
- Got it. Ready? - Yeah.

160
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,870
好
Okay.

161
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,850
好
Yup.

162
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,230
我就知道当初该去做男拉拉队员的
I knew I should have been a male cheerleader.

163
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,790
追逐梦想永远不晚
Well, it's never too late to chase your dreams.

164
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,910
有动静吗
Anything?

165
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,540
怎么会没有逃生口
How is there no escape hatch?

166
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,600
就是啊  如果真发生了紧急情况
Yeah, I mean, what are people supposed to do

167
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,730
让人怎么办啊
when there's an actual emergency, right?

168
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,570
这还不算紧急吗
Is this not an emergency?

169
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,500
好吧
Okay.

170
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,100
你没事吧
What, you okay?

171
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,130
-嗯  -你没事吧
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You okay?

172
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,920
-可以把我放下吗  -好  抱歉
- Yeah, can you just put me down, please? - Yes, I'm sorry.

173
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,390
你没事吧
Are you okay?

174
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,270
-嗯  -让我看看
- Yeah, I just-- - Let me see.

175
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,570
真的没事
Honestly, it's fine, I just--

176
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,160
我的自尊受伤更重
I bruised my ego more than anything.

177
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,080
好吧
Okay.

178
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,680
天呐
Oh my God.

179
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,680
我的航班
My flight.

180
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,390
过去多久了
How long has it been?

181
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,480
15分钟
Fifteen minutes.

182
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,230
感觉好像一小时
Okay, it feels like an hour.

183
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,900
现在真过一小时了
Now it's been an hour.

184
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,990
嗯  我是赶不上了
Yeah, I'm never gonna make it.

185
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,670
真遗憾
I'm so sorry.

186
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,250
-我好想哭  -不  千万别哭
- I feel like crying. - Oh no. Please don't cry.

187
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,580
-为什么  -我没带纸巾
- Why? - I don't have any Kleenex.

188
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
抱歉  我就是想活跃下气氛
Sorry, I'm just trying to lighten a shitty situation.

189
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,700
这简直太扯淡了
It's fucking bullshit is what it fucking is.

190
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,460
-阿门  -混蛋
- Amen. - Fucking motherfucker.

191
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,730
破烂玩意
Fucking piece of shit.

192
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,900
你个死破烂玩意
You fucking dick-sucking piece of shit!

193
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,530
你们这群白痴混蛋
You fucking mouth-breathing assholes,

194
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,970
人都哪去了
where are they?

195
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,470
说得对
I agree.

196
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,650
对了  我叫詹妮弗
I'm Jennifer, by the way.

197
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,560
我不...
I don't-- 

198
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,060
怎么了
What?

199
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,190
按说我们早该
You would have thought that we would have already

200
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,220
交换过名字了
exchanged names by now.

201
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,010
但  盖门
But... Guymon.

202
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,180
叫我盖就行
Guy.

203
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,430
认识你很高兴  盖
Nice to meet you, Guy.

204
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,310
我也很高兴认识你  詹妮弗
It's really nice to meet you, Jennifer.

205
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,150
很遗憾是在这样的情况下
I'm sorry it isn't under different circumstances.

206
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,640
真的  如果是换了人类史上
Actually, literally any other possible circumstance

207
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,400
任何其他的情况都比这样好
in the history of humankind would have been better.

208
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,310
真的吗
Really?

209
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,310
我可开心了
I mean, I'm having such a great time.

210
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,620
你常来这里吗
You come here often?

211
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,940
盖  我不知道
You know, Guy, I don't know

212
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,370
我能不能允许你问我这个
if I can let you ask me that right now.

213
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,140
我不是...
No, I'm not--

214
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,370
我一般先从
I mean, it's usually backed up with, like,

215
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,410
"可以请你喝点东西吗"开始
"Hey, can I buy you a drink?"

216
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,130
而实际上  我的保温杯是空的
and honestly, my thermos is empty

217
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,900
而我要渴死了
and I'm dying of thirst, so.

218
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,780
那...
Well...

219
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
不用多说了
say no more.

220
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,650
-不了  -我没长虱子的
- Oh no, I'm-- - I don't have cooties.

221
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,330
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean that.

222
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,790
我不会用喝你的水的
I'm not gonna take your water.

223
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,900
我坚持
I insist.

224
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,020
要不我就得开酒了
It's either this or I pop open the wine.

225
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,010
是旋盖的吗
Is it screw top?

226
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,200
不是
No.

227
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,320
但
But...

228
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,910
恰巧了  相信吗
It just so happens, believe it or not--hang on.

229
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,660
等等  你会笑的
You wait, you're gonna laugh.

230
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,580
看
Hup.

231
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,440
天呐
Oh my God.

232
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,200
是啊  难说呢  是吧
I mean, hey, you never know, right?

233
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,450
真的是啊
Yeah, truly.

234
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,050
我不知道这表明了我们的什么问题  但...
I mean, I don't know what it says about us, but...

235
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,060
表明我们是好童子军
Well, it says that we're good scouts.

236
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,800
时刻准备着
We're always prepared.

237
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,070
詹妮弗  请吧
Jennifer, please.

238
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,850
就喝一口
Just a sip.

239
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,280
给你了
Keep it.

240
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,560
随你喝
Have however much you want whenever you want it.

241
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,380
天呐  谢谢
Oh my God, thank you.

242
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,140
-不错吧  -太棒了
- Is it good? - So good.

243
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,410
如果你包里还有双份奶酪汉堡
Now if you had like a double cheeseburger in the bag.

244
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,810
我往常都在裤子里塞一个的
You know, I usually keep one stuffed down my pants

245
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,980
但  作为安慰奖
but... as a consolation prize,

246
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,200
给你点好时[吻]吧
why don't you have some Kisses?

247
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,000
抱歉  这太唐突了
Oh, I'm sorry, that's just very forward,

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,950
但我接受
but I do accept.

249
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,840
帮帮忙  别让我靠近那瓶酒
Just do me a favor and keep the wine away from me.

250
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,560
我是个自带开瓶器的姑娘
I mean, I am a girl who's packing her own corkscrew.

251
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,500
而且我们应该省着来
Plus I think we should definitely save our rations. I mean...

252
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,760
谁知道我们要困多久
who knows how long we're gonna be stuck in here.

253
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,600
我觉得最糟的情况
No, I would say worst case scenario--

254
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,550
最糟情况  到周二之前
Worst case scenario, we're stuck here

255
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,140
我们要被困80小时
80 hours until Tuesday.

256
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,760
相信我  我算了
Yeah, trust me I've done the math.

257
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,370
你考虑过做会计吗
Have you ever considered a career as an accountant?

258
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,420
因为菲尼根-哈特曼或许
'Cause Finnegan Hartman might be

259
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,760
-是正合适你的地方  -拜托  别逗我笑
- just the institution for you. - Please, don't make me laugh.

260
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,180
会让我想尿尿的
It's gonna make me wanna pee.

261
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,960
没事  我保证  我不介意的
It's okay, I promise, I don't mind.

262
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,000
不要
No.

263
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,600
太丢人了
So embarrassing.

264
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
詹妮弗
Jennifer.

265
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,330
看着我
Look at me. 

266
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,940
这就是一件你完全不能自控
It's just something that you have to do

267
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,070
而且你非做不可的事
that's completely out of your control.

268
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,420
我们都困了几小时了
We've been here for four hours,

269
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,200
很快  我也得做了
so pretty soon it's gonna be something I have to do too.

270
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,750
天呐
Oh God.

271
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,560
你肯定是那种完全不介意
You know, I'm sure you're one of those people

272
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,150
裸奔的人
that are super comfortable walking around naked

273
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,250
什么的
or whatever, but...

274
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,940
但我是个很注重隐私的人
I'm an extremely private person.

275
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,740
好吧
Okay, I just...

276
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,660
天呐  我需要空间
Oh God, I need my space.

277
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,240
我完全理解  所以我才要跟你说
I completely understand and that is why I'm telling you,

278
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,670
在那边占据你的空间
take your space over there

279
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,910
标记你的领地吧
and go mark your territory.

280
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,500
哪里
Where? Where?

281
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,470
就在那个角落里撒  我在这边
Go over there in the corner, i'll go over here,

282
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,560
转过去
turn my back,

283
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,810
你拿我大衣撒好了
and you can just go on my coat.

284
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,380
什么
What?

285
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,040
这大衣挺旧了  我不在乎的  真的
What, it's an old coat, I don't care. Honestly.

286
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,540
我回头再洗干净  或烧了
I'll get it cleaned or incinerated.

287
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,940
我不会在你大衣上撒尿的
I'm not gonna pee on your coat.

288
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,190
好吧
Okay.

289
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,180
那...
Well then...

290
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,620
用你的空保温杯吧
why don't you go in your empty thermos?

291
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,680
闭上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

292
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,880
捂上你的耳朵
Cover your ears.

293
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,770
你尿了吗
You going?

294
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,230
现在我尿不出了
Great, I can't now.

295
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,190
-什么  -现在我尿不出了
- What? - I can't now.

296
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,910
想想尼亚加拉大瀑布
Just think about Niagara Falls

297
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,660
或是别人撒尿
or someone else peeing.

298
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,250
什么都听不到
Can't hear anything.

299
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,950
完事了
Well, that just happened.

300
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,380
嗯
Yup.

301
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,280
是啊
Yup, it did.

302
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,130
好丢人
That was embarrassing.

303
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,440
不
No, no.

304
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,260
记住  我们是一个阵线的
Remember, we're all in this together.

305
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,490
这里所有人
Everyone in here.

306
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,640
这下妥了
Well, it's official.

307
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,040
我错过了航班
I've missed my flight.

308
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,390
还有下个情人节嘛
Well, there's always next Valentine's Day.

309
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,420
盖  我真的感激你的努力
You know, Guy, I really appreciate your efforts.

310
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,140
虽然你的笑话都很冷
Even though your jokes are really bad.

311
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,010
那你得怪我老爸
Well, you can blame my dad for that.

312
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,140
我就是想
I guess I'm just trying to...

313
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,870
避免我们都疯掉
keep us from going completely insane.

314
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,820
我觉得你已经来不及了
I think you're too late on that one.

315
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,710
这样就行了
That'll do it.

316
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,540
我不撒谎...
I'm not gonna lie...

317
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,390
我起初还不确定
I wasn't sure at first.

318
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,340
给
Here.

319
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,680
但你是个好
But... you are a very good

320
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,690
困在电梯里的伙伴
stuck-in-the-elevator buddy.

321
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,580
谢谢
Thank you.

322
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,880
你还有别的伙伴吗
Do you have any other buddies?

323
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,820
你结婚了吗
Like are you married?

324
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,190
男友  女友
Boyfriend? Girlfriend?

325
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,660
有人会来救我们吗
Anyone who'd come and save us?

326
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,040
没有  全都没有
No, actually, none of the above.

327
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,520
我跟我的工作有种
I am in a kind of all-encompassing

328
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,850
无所不包的扭曲关系
dysfunctional relationship with my job

329
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,510
这对我们不是好消息  因为都没人知道
which is not good news for us because nobody knows

330
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,580
我今晚加班了
that I even worked late tonight

331
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,240
或是我有任何理由还在楼里
or that I would still be here for any reason at all.

332
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,700
这么说
And saying that--

333
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,480
这么大声说出来
saying that out loud is...

334
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,470
真的好让人郁闷  好可悲
kind of very, very depressing and pathetic.

335
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,630
你呢
You?

336
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,670
一样
Same.

337
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,950
那...
Well...

338
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,600
你非要赶的那趟
what about this, like, super important flight

339
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,920
超重要的航班呢  肯定有...
that you had to catch? I mean, there must have been--

340
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,360
我有
What, that I had someone

341
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,900
在等着我的人吗
just waiting for me?

342
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,530
发现我不见了的人
Someone who would know I'd be missing?

343
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,880
没有
No.

344
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,440
其实是一时兴起
It's kind of a spur of the moment thing.

345
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,730
说来话长
It's complicated, it's a long story.

346
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,170
如果你想谈谈这个
Well, if you wanna talk about it,

347
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,980
或任何事的话
or anything at all for that matter,

348
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,390
我反正哪都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

349
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,580
没什么好谈的
There's really nothing to talk about.

350
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,130
挺蠢的
I mean, it's stupid.

351
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,310
我就是想去给一个人惊喜
I was just gonna go surprise someone.

352
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,440
一个
Someone who...

353
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,490
都不知道我要来的人
didn't even know I was coming.

354
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,240
或许都不希望我去
Probably didn't even want me to come.

355
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,190
我们真登对  是吧
Quite the pair we are, huh?

356
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,640
等等  我以为...
Wait, I thought...

357
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,580
你要打开你的酒
You're gonna open your bottle of wine?

358
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,620
我觉得是时候了
Well... I figured it's about that time.

359
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,190
你确定吗
You sure?

360
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,850
反正都开了
Well, it's already done now.

361
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,090
我恐怕本来也只会再转送出去
I was probably just gonna re-gift this anyway, so.

362
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,700
再说  我们不要再自怨自艾了
Besides, we're done feeling sorry for ourselves.

363
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,810
那好
All right.

364
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,730
女士优先
Ladies first.

365
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,290
不赖
It's not bad.

366
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,630
虽然不好  但也不赖
I mean, it's not good but it's not bad.

367
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,080
我说了  还算有档次的客户
Hm, like I said, fairly classy client.

368
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,340
我们在庆祝什么
So what are we celebrating?

369
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,840
没死如何
How about not being dead yet?

370
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,310
这我愿喝
I'll drink to that.

371
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,120
不许看
No peeking.

372
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,440
怎么回事
What is that?

373
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,690
有人吗
Hello?

374
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,230
喂
Hello!

375
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,460
希望不是坏现象
I hope that wasn't a bad thing.

376
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,950
几点了
What time is it?

377
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,310
你真想知道吗
You really wanna know?

378
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,220
不想  但说吧
No, but yes.

379
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,950
几点了
Just what time is it?

380
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,580
周六凌晨1点
It's 1:00 a.m. Saturday.

381
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,730
周末开始了
The weekend's begun.

382
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,150
我们派对吧
Let's party!

383
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,670
我们会出去的  别担心
Hey, we're gonna get out of here, don't worry.

384
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,910
我们没事的
We'll be fine.

385
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,970
我知道
I know.

386
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,220
-好吧  -好
- So. - So.

387
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,450
可以告诉你件事吗
Can I tell you something?

388
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,210
嗯
Yeah.

389
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,530
我有事没跟你说实话
I wasn't completely honest with you about something

390
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,990
我有点不安
and it's been bugging me

391
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,130
所以我想跟你说实话
so I really wanna be straight with you.

392
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,330
好
Okay.

393
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,800
我之前暗示说我之前没在楼里
When I implied earlier that I'd never seen you before

394
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,710
见过你
around the building,

395
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,860
这其实不完全准确
um, that wasn't completely true.

396
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,750
因为我们当时...现在的
Given the circumstances that we were in--

397
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,050
情况
that we are in--

398
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,520
我就是不想
I just didn't wanna say anything

399
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,220
让你对这种情况  或对我
that might have made you feel even more uncomfortable

400
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,580
感到
than, you know, you already were

401
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,480
更加不安
with the situation or with me.

402
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,090
当时  我觉得如果我说
At the time, I thought that if I told you

403
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,750
我记得在楼里见过你
that I did recognize you from the building,

404
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,380
我怕你以为我是个
I didn't want you to think I was some kind of, like,

405
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,600
跟踪狂什么的
stalker or something.

406
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,320
好吧  你是说你见过我
Okay, so when you say you've seen me...

407
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,050
嗯
Yeah?

408
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,290
到什么程度
To what extent do you mean?

409
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,820
我在走廊里见过你几次
I just--I've seen you a couple times in the halls

410
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,270
主要是在大堂
and just in the lobby mostly.

411
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,000
我不觉得你是跟踪狂  盖
I don't think you're a stalker, Guy.

412
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,020
嗯
Yeah.

413
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,950
好吧
Well, right.

414
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,570
但是  再坦诚一件事
However, to be even more honest...

415
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,480
我之前看到你时
when I've seen you,

416
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,030
还注意到了你
I've noticed you.

417
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,320
我记得我还想
I just remember thinking to myself,

418
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,690
"她看上去挺阳光的
"Hey, you know, she seems like a pretty upbeat person

419
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,280
或许她人挺不错"
and she--perhaps she's even really nice."

420
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,680
"而且
"And...

421
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,230
她很漂亮
she's very pretty.

422
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,230
我真想认识认识她"
She's definitely someone I'd like to know."

423
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,290
好吧
Well...

424
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,250
现在你认识了
now you do.

425
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,310
而且
And...

426
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,380
我可以
I can...

427
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,930
证实  你确实是个
confirm that you are indeed

428
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,810
很不错的人
a very nice person.

429
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,780
谢谢
Thank you.

430
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,950
而且你还很漂亮
And you're also very pretty.

431
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,440
好了  准备好了吗
Okay, ready?

432
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,790
没有
No.

433
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,580
好吧
Okay.

434
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,270
-准备好了吗  -嗯
- Ready? - Okay.

435
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,170
你来
You go.

436
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,750
-一起吧  -好
- Together. - Okay.

437
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,610
-一  -二
- One... - Two...

438
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,530
三
Three.

439
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,610
糟了
Oh shit.

440
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,240
老天  对不起
Oh man, I'm sorry.

441
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,640
真的对不起
I'm so sorry.

442
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,920
-不  我很喜欢  -画得真好
- No, I love that. - This is so good.

443
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
-你捕捉到了...  -谢谢
- You have captured-- - Thank you.

444
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,450
其他人没见过的我
A side of me that literally no one has ever seen.

445
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,650
你知道吗
You know what?

446
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,310
你要打电话了
Oh, you're just gonna make a phone call.

447
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,980
不是
No.

448
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,660
如果我们活着出去
If we survive this...

449
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,760
我要用这个当头像
I'm gonna make this my profile picture.

450
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,800
我太荣幸了
Wow, I'm honored.

451
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,390
能知道人们对你真正的想法很有趣
It's kind of amazing to see how people really see you.

452
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,380
是啊  你就告诉我了
Yeah, you're telling me.

453
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,990
拜托  这个一点也不准确
Come on, that is not accurate at all.

454
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,950
我现在太饿了  根本没法正常思考
I'm like barely functioning right now from how hungry I am.

455
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,980
我也是
Oh, me too.

456
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,690
我脑子想的全是
All I can think about is, like,

457
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,700
大份多汁的甘蓝沙拉
a big juicy kale salad.

458
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,940
甘蓝沙拉
A kale salad?

459
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,080
我现在想的是厚厚一叠薄煎饼
Like, I'm thinking about a fat stack of pancakes.

460
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,930
浸润在枫树糖浆里
Like, smothered in syrup and--

461
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,640
一盘纯肉披萨
Deep dish meat pizza.

462
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,250
-天哪  -塔可餐车里的墨西哥煎饼
- Oh God. - Taco truck burrito--

463
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,810
好了  别说了别说了  不说吃的
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop. No more food.

464
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,590
拜托  没得吃已经很难熬了
Come on, this is already painful enough as it is.

465
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,460
那我们聊一些
Yeah, we'll talk about something

466
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,670
没那么让人向往的东西
that is definitely much less desirable.

467
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,690
你想聊什么
What do you wanna talk about?

468
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,140
随便你
Whatever you wanna talk about.

469
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,610
橄榄球
Um...football.

470
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,720
不
No!

471
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,780
棒球  汽车
Baseball? Cars?

472
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,890
性爱
Sex?

473
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,930
机器人
Robots?

474
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,400
行  那我们聊聊性爱
All right, let's talk about sex.

475
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,970
不
No.

476
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,250
-你提的  -我在开玩笑
- You called it. - I was joking.

477
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,010
好吧  你想聊聊性爱
All right, you wanna talk about sex?

478
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,550
那我们说点有趣的
Let's make it interesting.

479
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,280
看着镜头
Okay, now look into the camera.

480
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,150
不
No.

481
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,660
我想让你说出你最狂野的做爱地点
And I want you to tell me the dirtiest place that you've had sex in.

482
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,040
好吧
Um, okay.

483
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,600
我的天  你想让我先说吗
Oh my God, do you want me to go first?

484
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,810
好啊
Sure.

485
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,890
好吧  拿着  你来录我
All right. Here, record me.

486
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,430
好
Okay.

487
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,020
拿好了
Got it.

488
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,580
好的
Okay.

489
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,720
图书馆
The library.

490
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,620
什么
What?

491
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,620
那是在大学
It was college.

492
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,910
我的男友和我
I mean, so my boyfriend and I--

493
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,220
我那时的男友
my boyfriend at the time--

494
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,590
想了个有趣的主意  我们每人选一本
had a brilliant idea that we'd each go get--

495
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,910
你知道那种烂俗的浪漫小说吗
you know those cheesy romance novels?

496
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,520
知道
Yeah.

497
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,310
我们每人选一本  然后念出来
So we'd get one of those and read out, like,

498
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,940
念书里最淫荡的部分给对方听
the raunchiest section to each other.

499
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,260
然后  一开始是开玩笑
And... it started off as a joke,

500
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,440
但我不知道
but I don't know,

501
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,090
后来让我来了性致
it ended up turning me on.

502
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,990
我不  我猜以前我没读过这种小说  所以
I don't--I guess I never read trashy novels before, so.

503
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,140
即使是含有那种
Even ones that include lines like,

504
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,480
-"紫色脑袋的战士"和...  -没错
- "Purple-headed warrior" and... - Exactly!

505
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,850
比如"她急促地喘息着  胸部被汗水浸湿"
Like, "Her heaving, sweat-glistened breasts."

506
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,820
好吧  停
Okay, stop.

507
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,790
你太擅长这个了
You're way too good at this.

508
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,920
好吧
All right.

509
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,400
来  轮到你了
Go, your turn.

510
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,240
好吧  我不知道自己怎么才能超过你
Okay, I don't know how I'm gonna top,

511
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,010
你的大学男友
you know, your college boyfriend

512
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,800
给了你一场传统的杜威十进图书分类性爱
giving you the old Dewey Decimal System.

513
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,760
说嘛
Come on!

514
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,300
很不幸  我只能说我真的没有
Unfortunately, I hate to say that I really don't have a...

515
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,650
一个能和你媲美的故事
a story that is comparable to that.

516
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,130
-我不信  -是真的
- I don't believe you. - It's the truth.

517
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,070
我为什么要撒谎
Why would I lie about that?

518
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,220
我应该在这编一个
I should be standing here making up

519
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,690
最淫秽  最刺激的
the raunchiest, most fucking amazing--

520
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,880
行  那就这样
All right, so then do that.

521
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,210
编一个在你无话可说的生活中你能想到的
Make up the most bullshit sex tale that you can come up with

522
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,860
最胡扯的性爱故事
of your unstoried sex life.

523
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,130
好吧  你真的想让我说
Okay, you really want me to?

524
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,460
好吧  我说到哪了
Okay, well, where am I?

525
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,640
我正在做一个项目
So I'm working on a new project

526
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,730
然后有这么个姑娘
and, uh, there's this girl

527
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,780
她也在项目里
who's involved in the project

528
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,690
而且她美极了
and she's fucking gorgeous,

529
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,000
绝对是个十分
ten out of ten,

530
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,150
简直就是行走的亚马逊女神
Amazon goddess walking the face--

531
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,510
我很着迷她  所有人都是
I'm obsessed with her. Everybody--

532
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,850
她是公司最性感火辣的人
she's the hottest fucking person at work

533
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,320
我整天对着她流口水
and I'm like drooling over her.

534
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,600
然后
And, um--

535
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,620
但我什么也没做  直到公司聚会
but I don't do anything about it until this big work picnic.

536
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,160
她简直美炸了  我们开始喝酒
She just looks banging and we start drinking,

537
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,480
大家都在喝酒
everybody's drinking,

538
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,870
然后突然  她靠近了我
and suddenly, she approaches me

539
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,960
我们喝了点酒
and we have some drinks

540
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,020
然后我们回到我的车
and then we kinda sneak back to my car

541
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,070
我们又玩闹了一会
and we're partying some more.

542
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,570
然后我们开始开车
And we're driving now

543
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,960
然后她说  "你的挡杆"
and she's--she's like, "Your stick shift--"

544
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,600
不  等等  这太明显了
No, wait, that's so obvious.

545
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,780
等等  等等
Hang on a second, hang on a second.

546
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,060
她就说
She's like,

547
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,640
"为什么这东西叫手套箱"
"Why do they call them glove boxes?"

548
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,680
她就是这么说的
She talks like that.

549
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,420
然后我回答"我不知道  如果你有手套
And I go, "I don't know, if you had some gloves,

550
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,230
可以把手套放那吧"
we'd put 'em on in there, I guess."

551
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,980
然后她看着我说
And then she looks at me and she goes,

552
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,620
"但我没有手套"
"Well, I don't have any gloves."

553
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,370
然后她慢慢地脱下
And then she slowly slides off

554
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,810
极度性感诱惑的
the most incredibly sexy

555
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,320
一条内裤
pair of underwear...

556
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,000
然后
And, uh...

557
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,680
她就  把内裤放进了手套箱
She just like, she puts 'em in the glove box and--

558
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,560
这太蠢了  我感觉好奇怪
This is so stupid, I feel so weird

559
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,250
很不舒服  这不是
and uncomfortable, it's not--

560
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,890
等等  什么  你可不能现在停
Wait, what? You can not stop there.

561
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,130
我的天  你脸红了
Oh my God, you're blushing.

562
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,520
这不是唯一一件
Well, that's not the only thing

563
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,980
现在我不由自主的事
that is starting to do something involuntary right now.

564
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,450
好吧  感觉涉及到隐私了
Hm, all right. That's pretty personal.

565
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,080
这是你
Well, that's...

566
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,340
你想听的  对吧
what you wanted, right?

567
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,550
本着坦诚相见的原则
In the spirit of being intensely honest,

568
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,700
这是  我们现在是在玩真心话吧
that's--I mean, that's what we're doing now, right?

569
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,140
-没错  -好吧
- That is correct. - Okay.

570
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,840
怎么了
What?

571
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,470
没什么  你就是
Nothing, you're just, you know.

572
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,340
你刚才说的
What you're saying is is that...

573
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,820
你说你现在来了性致
you're telling me that you're aroused right now.

574
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,080
是的
Yes.

575
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,940
靠  我真是
Oh, fuck, I'm so--

576
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,520
我过分了  对不对
So, I crossed a line, right?

577
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,440
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

578
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,970
这  我  天哪  真抱歉
It's-- I-- oh my God, I'm so sorry.

579
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,900
我想的不是这个意思
Wasn't what I was thinking.

580
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,960
我只是  你对我很诚实
I just--you know, you were being honest

581
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,060
我就想...
and I was just thinking...

582
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,230
没关系
that's cool.

583
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,410
没关系吗
It's cool?

584
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,900
你知道
You know...

585
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,990
还有句实话
another true statement.

586
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,850
我现在很想吻你
I'd really like to kiss you.

587
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,880
这也许不是个好主意
That's probably not a good idea.

588
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,610
是吗
Right?

589
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,000
好吧
Okay.

590
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,190
好吧
Okay.

591
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,340
停
Stop.

592
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:56,960
好吧
Okay.

593
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,000
好吧
Okay.

594
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,990
天哪
Oh God.

595
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,200
操
Fuck.

596
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,800
你太棒了
You are amazing.

597
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,050
我觉得自己会爱上你
I could fall in love with you.

598
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,400
你还好吗
Are you all right?

599
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,290
嗯
Yeah.

600
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,290
好吧
Okay.

601
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,030
我得知道你的想法
I need to know what you're thinking

602
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,370
因为说真的
because, personally,

603
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,050
我自己现在有好多想法
I'm having... A lot of thoughts

604
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,760
还有情感  然后
and feelings and, uh...

605
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,930
我想先听听你的
I'd really like to hear yours first.

606
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,630
好吧
Okay.

607
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,070
我在想
I was thinking that

608
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,130
昨天本该是我修复一切的一天
yesterday was gonna be the day that I fixed everything.

609
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,570
我打算周末飞到纽约
I was gonna fly to New York for the weekend,

610
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,730
给我前未婚夫一个情人节惊喜
I was gonna surprise my ex-fiancé for Valentine's Day,

611
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,390
然后复合
and get back together.

612
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,970
你懂的  原谅忘记过去
You know, forgive and forget everything

613
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,160
破镜重圆
and...patch things up.

614
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,840
重修于好
Make everything okay.

615
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,390
那现在呢
And now?

616
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,460
我还是要这么做
Now I'm still gonna do that.

617
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,690
别误会我
I mean, don't get me wrong,

618
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,390
在这发生的一切
what happened here was--

619
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,750
很有趣  考虑到现在的情况
it was fun and considering the circumstances...

620
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,350
非常地美好
it was surprisingly nice.

621
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
但我爱他
But I love him.

622
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,140
而且他和我所拥有的
And what he and I have,

623
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,100
是真情实意
it's real.

624
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,670
而这个
And this...

625
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,360
这也是真情
This--this is real.

626
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,000
我是说
I mean...

627
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,930
我是真的  你知道吗
I'm real, you know?

628
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,700
这一切  是真的
This is... real.

629
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,990
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say

630
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,780
这一切都是偶然
is that this, this was casual.

631
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,290
拜托
You know? I mean, come on.

632
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,470
我们只认识了一天
We've only known each other for one day.

633
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,240
听着  盖  我只是想对你坦诚相告
Look, Guy, I'm just trying to be honest with you.

634
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,130
这很棒
Which is--it's great.

635
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,060
其实感觉很自由
It's actually freeing.

636
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,460
其实每一段
You know, it's actually what

637
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,130
稳定的关系都该这样
every committed relationship should be like.

638
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,620
完全的坦诚
Just complete transparency.

639
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,190
你和你前任也是这样吗
Is that what you had with your ex?

640
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,370
完全的坦诚
I mean, complete honesty?

641
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,040
没有
No.

642
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,770
其实这就是问题
That was exactly the problem.

643
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,450
那你为什么要跟他复合
So then why are you going back with him?

644
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,010
如果你们关系真的不好
I mean, if it was really that bad.

645
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,720
就像
Like...

646
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,000
刚才发生的事
with what just happened.

647
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,040
我们俩的事
With us.

648
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,390
我们有很多过去
We have history.

649
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,370
而这
And this is--

650
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,210
这只是某种幻想
this is some weird fantasy.

651
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,860
詹
Jen...

652
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,340
我们有感觉
we connected.

653
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,130
你知道
You know...

654
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,420
他配不上你
he doesn't deserve you.

655
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,050
他都不想让你去  不是吗
He didn't even want you there, right?

656
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,250
盖  首先
Whoa, whoa, Guy, first of all,

657
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,820
你不认识他  好吗
you don't know him, okay?

658
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,910
你都不认识我
And you don't even know me.

659
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,550
是啊
Yeah.

660
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,070
听着  我不想太无礼
Look, I'm not trying to be rude,

661
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,700
但我们之间没什么
but we're not a thing.

662
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,940
嗯
Yeah.

663
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,090
你说得对
You're right, and...

664
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,990
等我们出去  我要带你约会
when we get outta here, I'm gonna take you out--

665
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,430
等我们出去
When we get outta here, okay,

666
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,830
你回你的生活
you're gonna go back to your life

667
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,020
我回我的生活
and I'm gonna go back to mine.

668
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,990
装作这一切都没发生吗
And just act like none of this ever happened?

669
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,810
很显然发生了啊
Obviously it happened.

670
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,870
拜托  我们不能当作这没发生
Come on, I mean, we can't erase that.

671
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,970
这也没关系  没事
And that's fine, really, all right,

672
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,470
但这不能改变我现在的感觉
but it's not gonna change the way that I feel now

673
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,840
也不会改变我之后的感觉
and it's definitely not gonna change anything later.

674
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,010
听着
Look...

675
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,610
不如我们这样想
why don't we think about it like this?

676
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,800
你现在有个狂野疯狂的性爱故事可说
All right, now you have this crazy sex tale that you can share.

677
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,050
好吧  但是
Okay, but like...

678
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,070
你难道不觉得这一切是
Don't you believe that this somehow, like,

679
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,000
这一切是
that all this was some sort of like...

680
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,150
命运吗
fate?

681
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,110
真有趣  就仿佛
It's so funny, it's like...

682
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,330
我们被锁在这小小的铁盒子里
Like we're locked in this tiny little box

683
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,000
但我们仍好像隔着千万里
but we're still a million miles apart.

684
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,490
盖  拜托
Guy, come on.

685
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,410
不
No.

686
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,480
没关系
It's fine.

687
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,400
都没关系了
Doesn't even matter.

688
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,260
我们会没事的
We'll be fine.

689
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,260
因为我们对彼此坦诚
Because we're honest with each other.

690
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,850
这是最重要的  对吗
And that's the most important thing, right?

691
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,850
在所有稳定的关系里
In every committed relationship?

692
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,610
就好像
You know, it's just...

693
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,350
你身上有某种气质
there's just something about you

694
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,920
让我想要对你坦诚相告
that makes me want to be so honest with you.

695
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,010
我想告诉你一切
I want to tell you everything.

696
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,560
我想告诉你比如说
I want to tell you things like...

697
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,070
我不是楼里新来的
I'm not new to the building.

698
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,190
我不是会计
I'm not an accountant.

699
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,240
我的名字不叫盖
My name isn't Guy.

700
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,750
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

701
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,420
而且
And...

702
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,220
我早就注意到你了
I certainly have noticed you,

703
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,940
詹妮弗·罗宾斯
Jennifer Robbins.

704
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,050
我没告诉你我的姓
I didn't tell you my last name.

705
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,520
我注意你也不是一两次
But not just a couple of times.

706
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,670
而是几十次
Try dozens of times.

707
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,110
几百次
Hundreds of times.

708
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,010
比如
Like...

709
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,510
其实是每一天
every single work day, in fact.

710
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,110
让我看看
Let me see. Hm.

711
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,490
早上九点到
Arriving at 9:00 A.M.

712
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,190
总是最后一个走
Always the last one to leave.

713
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,250
晚上七点  或者八点
7:00, sometimes 8:00.

714
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,380
这个
This.

715
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,770
比如今晚
You know, like tonight.

716
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,460
就在你进电梯之前
Right before you got into this elevator.

717
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,060
我怎么会知道这些呢
And how do I know all that?

718
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,010
因为
Because...

719
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,140
大楼保安能看到所有人
building security guard sees everyone.

720
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,070
注意并观察着所有人
Notices everyone, watches everyone,

721
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,520
知道他们的行踪
knows all their comings and goings

722
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,940
每一天
every fucking day,

723
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,160
但没有人看见我们
but nobody ever fucking sees us

724
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,110
因为我们是一群
because we're fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking,

725
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,610
隐形人
fucking, fucking invisible!

726
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,900
你是保安
You're a security guard?

727
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,790
前台
Front desk.

728
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,590
楼里最繁忙的职位
Busiest place in the building.

729
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,580
地球上最孤独的工作
Loneliest job on the planet.

730
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,440
但我知道我不是一个人
But I know I wasn't alone in here.

731
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,270
我知道我能看到另一个人眼里
I know I was looking into the eyes of another human being.

732
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:34,930
是不是
Right?

733
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,980
我知道我和你共同经历过
I know I was sharing an experience with you.

734
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,990
我就在那
I was there.

735
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,560
在你身体里
Inside of you.

736
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,720
我们抱着对方
We were holding each other.

737
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,420
不是吗
Right?

738
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,590
这不是我编的
I'm not making that up.

739
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,140
我了解你  詹妮弗
I know you, Jennifer.

740
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,740
比戴瑞克了解的多了
More than fucking Derek knows you.

741
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,160
但很显然这对你还不够
But that's not enough for you, clearly.

742
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,010
这对你来说还不够
This wasn't enough for you, right?

743
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,460
我为你计划了整个周末
Everything that I planned this weekend, for you!

744
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,370
为你  詹妮弗
For you, Jennifer.

745
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,710
为我们
For us.

746
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,310
发生的这一切
Everything that happened.

747
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,220
但是  但是
But... but...

748
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,740
如果你想走
if you wanna go,

749
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,900
你可以走
you can go.

750
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,060
我的天
Ugh... oh my God.

751
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,830
你有钥匙
You've had a key.

752
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,450
是我疯了吗
Am I insane?

753
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,100
你把我锁在了电梯里
You had me locked in an elevator?

754
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,070
没错  我糟糕透了  没错
Mm, yeah, I'm fucked up, yeah.

755
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,790
我是个混蛋  对吧
I'm a fuckin' asshole, right?

756
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,690
我的天  我们还做了爱
Oh my God, we fucking had sex.

757
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,970
你以为自己是谁
Who the fuck do you think you are?

758
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,310
我要叫警察来抓你
I'm gonna fucking call the cops on you.

759
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,190
你要去坐牢
You're gonna go to fucking jail.

760
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,670
你要为这事坐牢
You're going to fucking jail for this,

761
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,540
你听见了吗
do you hear me?

762
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,970
你要坐穿牢底
You're gonna rot in fucking jail!

763
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,830
那可不行
I can't have that.

764
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,230
不
No!

765
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,510
不  不要  不要
No, don't... don't...

766
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,650
停  停
Stop... stop...

767
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,840
不  操
No... fuck...

768
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,000
操  天哪
Fuck... no!

769
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,920
你弄断了
You broke it?

770
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,500
不不不
No, no, no.

771
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,900
我操
Fuck!

772
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,600
我操  你个臭傻逼
Fuck you, you fuckin' piece of shit!

773
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,790
我要杀了你
I'll fucking kill you!

774
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,190
欢迎回来
Oh, hi, welcome back.

775
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,290
我敢肯定
Safe to say,

776
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,400
你不喜欢我刚才活跃气氛的方法
you didn't like my little icebreaker.

777
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,150
为什么
Why?

778
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:25,940
为什么
Why?

779
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,280
拜托  詹
I mean, come on, Jen.

780
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,320
这难道不是认识姑娘
What better way to meet a girl

781
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,520
最好的方法吗
than to set up a situation

782
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,930
困在一个地方让她了解你
where she has time to get to know you?

783
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,490
没有分心事和发短信
Away from distractions and text messages,

784
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,520
去和别人联系
to connect with another human being.

785
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,940
而现在  看看我们
And now, here we are.

786
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,940
我不仅成功了
And not only have I achieved that,

787
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,910
还跟你展开了一段感情
we practically had an entire relationship.

788
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,470
我们认识了  聊了天
We... we met, we talked,

789
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,620
了解了对方  做了爱
we got to know each other, we fucked.

790
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,450
吵架  还分手了
We fought, we broke up.

791
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,070
都在一个周末  一个房间
All in a weekend, all in a room.

792
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,100
你逃不掉的
You're not gonna get away with this.

793
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,130
-会有人来的  -不不
- Someone's coming. - No, no, no-- no.

794
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,330
没人会来的  詹
No one's coming, Jen.

795
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:12,100
其他的保安呢
What about the other security guards?

796
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,510
-肯定有好几个  -既然你问了
- There has to be several. - Well, since you asked,

797
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,550
本来这周末有三个保安值班
there were three of us scheduled for this holiday weekend,

798
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,160
首先我告诉菲利普我替他代班
so first I told Phillip that I would take his shift,

799
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,510
然后我告诉艾迪一样的事
and then I told Eddie the same thing,

800
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,300
艾迪交了个新女友
and Eddie's got a hot new girlfriend,

801
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,820
自然他迫不及待答应了
so, naturally, he jumped at the chance,

802
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,910
所以詹  周二之前没人会来
so, no, Jen, no one is coming until Tuesday.

803
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,850
你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do?

804
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,970
你也跟我困在这了
You're stuck in here with me too.

805
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:39,560
是啊  没错
Yeah, that's right.

806
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,710
你让我们俩都陷入了困境  不是吗 
You really fucked it up for both of us, didn't you?

807
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,960
所以我该想想该怎么办
So I've gotta figure out what to do with you.

808
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,270
因为我告诉你
Because I'll tell you right now,

809
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,280
我宁愿杀了你  也不愿回去坐牢
I'd rather kill you than go back to prison.

810
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,490
你个怪物
Fucking monster.

811
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,230
-你个怪物  -不
- You're a fucking monster. - No.

812
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,720
不  我不是
No, I'm not.

813
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,120
你看  我没逼迫你做任何事
See, I never forced you to do anything.

814
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,790
没逼你做你不想做的事
Anything you didn't want to do.

815
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,830
我只是营造了这个氛围
All I did was encourage the situation.

816
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,350
营造了这个氛围
Encourage the situation?

817
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,560
你他妈绑架了我
You fucking kidnapped me!

818
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,800
不  我没有绑架你
No! I did not kidnap you!

819
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,850
你之前喜欢我的
You liked me!

820
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,090
我们有感觉了  你个婊子
We connected, you bitch!

821
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:37,790
但之后你搞砸了
But then, you fucked it up!

822
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,650
我感觉好多了
I feel better.

823
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,480
感觉好多了
I feel better.

824
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,080
我们拆礼物吧
Let's open some gifts.

825
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,940
介意我猜猜这是什么吗
Mind if I take a stab at what this is?

826
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,630
我们看看  这是同意了吗
Let's see, was that a yes?

827
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,520
什么
What?

828
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,100
我觉得不是乐高
Well, I'm not going with Legos.

829
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,070
我不知道
I don't know.

830
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,380
我们看看
Let's see.

831
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,450
"给戴瑞克  爱你的J"
"To Derek, love, J."

832
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,410
简短温馨
Nice and simple.

833
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,680
拆开看看
Mm, let's see.

834
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,150
詹妮
Jenny!

835
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,830
你不该破费的
You shouldn't have.

836
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,570
是大号  大号
Is this a large-- it's a large!

837
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,710
不会吧
No fucking way.

838
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,960
我有个想法也许...
I got an inkling that maybe...

839
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,830
你知道吗
you know what?

840
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,330
让我试试
Let me see.

841
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:49,790
看上去怎么样
How's it look?

842
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,230
谁能知道
Who knew

843
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,410
我和戴瑞克的尺码一样呢
that me and Derek were the same build?

844
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,960
看来你现在知道了
Well... I guess you know now, right?

845
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,790
好了  轮到你了
All right, your turn.

846
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,210
快点
Come on, please.

847
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,320
把盒子给我打开
Open the fucking box.

848
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,720
好吧
All right.

849
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,370
那我就来帮你一下
I'm just gonna help you a little bit,

850
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,940
剩下的可得你自己来
you gotta do the rest yourself.

851
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,040
把礼物打开  詹
Open the fucking present, Jen,

852
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,690
打开
Open it!

853
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,300
今天可是爱的日子
It's the day of fuckin' love.

854
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,240
快点
Come on, go ahead.

855
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,730
里面有什么
What is inside?

856
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,580
细支雪茄
Stogies!

857
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,050
这是什么
What's this?

858
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,840
我一直都很想试试这种
I've always wanted to try one of these guys.

859
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,510
还有一个很棒的打火机
And a really cool lighter.

860
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,850
怎么样
How 'bout that?

861
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,260
别一副我会伤害你的样子
Stop acting like I would fucking hurt you!

862
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,900
男人和雪茄到底是怎么回事
What is it about cigars and guys?

863
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,360
我们就是这么爱雪茄  它们不是...
We just fuckin' love them, aren't they--

864
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,310
它们就像
they're just like,

865
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,870
它们好像就有一种魅力
there's like a fascination with them, you know?

866
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,760
它们如此充满生殖器幻想
They're just like so phallic.

867
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,720
就像...
It's like...

868
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,560
就像你在吸一根冒烟的大屌  对吧
It's like you're sucking on a big, smoking dick, right?

869
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,510
你有什么淫秽的性爱故事吗
You have any, um, raunchy sex stories?

870
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,470
和雪茄有关的  你肯定有吧
With cigars? I bet you do, right?

871
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,720
没有
No!

872
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,520
来放进你嘴里
Put it in your mouth.

873
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,930
你看上去好他妈难过
You look so fuckin' sad!

874
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,610
詹  真的很可惜
Jen, it's really a shame, 

875
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,790
因为我觉得这些礼物这么笨
because I do think with all these nice gifts,

876
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,390
你本来可以挽回戴瑞克的
you would've gotten Derek back.

877
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,230
情人节快乐  詹
Happy fuckin' Valentine's Day, Jen.

878
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,320
我很抱歉  詹
I'm so sorry, Jen.

879
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,470
我有时生气的时候会失去控制
I lose it sometimes when I get mad

880
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,210
我吓到了你
and I scare you.

881
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:03,630
我不想再吓到你了
And I never wanna scare you again.

882
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:07,920
你还能再给我们一次机会吗
You think you can give us another chance?

883
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,360
你不用现在就着急下什么决定
You don't have to make any decisions right now,

884
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,380
好好考虑一下  好吗
just--just think about it, okay?

885
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,840
看看这两个人
Look at these two.

886
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:24,870
{\an8}你为什么不来

887
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,930
他们手牵着手
They're holding hands

888
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,720
漫步在夕阳下
in the sunset.

889
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:25,420
穿着浴袍微笑着指着我
Just pointing and smiling in their bathing suits.

890
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,780
看上去好开心
Look so happy.

891
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,710
阳光天空度假村
Sunny Sky Resort.

892
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,890
真美
So beautiful.

893
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,020
我想带你去那里
I wanna take you there.

894
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,910
而现在我们在这里
Yet here we are,

895
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:46,100
头顶上闪着讨厌的荧光灯
under these obnoxious flickering fluorescents.

896
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,280
除了这家伙  这家伙罢工了
Except for this guy, this guy's not workin'.

897
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,300
喂
Hello?

898
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,820
我们得跟人说说
Have to tell someone about that.

899
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:02,750
我们应该
We should...

900
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,270
让人来修修
point this out to maintenance.

901
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,530
现在又正常了
Now they're working.

902
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,130
他们这下不得不换掉那些灯泡了
Now they're definitely gonna have to replace that light bulb.

903
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,880
除非他们想换掉整个...
Unless they wanna replace the whole...

904
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,510
没有螺母
There's no screws.

905
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,070
这边没有螺母
There's no screws on this side.

906
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,230
我给你说个笑话
I got a joke for you.

907
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:42,560
换灯泡需要多少名保安
How many security guards does it take to change a light bulb?

908
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,540
一个都不用  因为我们不是门卫
None, because we're not fuckin' janitors.

909
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,700
但是门卫
But janitors

910
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,060
肯定也得换这些灯泡
have to be able to change these lights.

911
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,700
电梯顶的这一边
There can't be a solid ceiling 

912
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,350
不可能是封死的  对吧
on the other side of this panel, right?

913
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,340
如果我能打破这块板
If I could just break through this panel.

914
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,020
等等
Hang on.

915
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,200
来吧
Here we go.

916
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,250
太好了
Oh yes.

917
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,360
天啊
Oh my God!

918
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,200
詹
Jen!

919
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,380
上帝啊
Holy shit!

920
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,080
我们自由了
We're free.

921
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,370
为什么我之前没想到呢
Why the fuck didn't I think of that before?

922
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:37,500
好了
Okay.

923
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,840
你能顶我上去吗
Can you give me a boost?

924
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,190
我从上面爬出去
I'm gonna climb up through the shaft.

925
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,110
我到大厅里后
When I get to the lobby,

926
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:43,780
再下来从外面把门打开
I'll come back down and open the doors from the outside,

927
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,030
我会把你救出去的  好吗
I'll get you outta here, okay?

928
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,070
不  我觉得还是你顶我上去比较好
No, I think it's gonna be easier if you boost me.

929
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:49,880
-不不不  -你好好想想
- No, no, no. - Think about it,

930
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,860
我没有足够的力气把你顶上去  而且
I don't have enough strength to push you up, and...

931
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,060
我会完全照你说的做
and I'll do anything that you say,

932
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,750
你只要教我就行了
you just talk me through it.

933
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,710
什么  不行  那上面太高了  听着
What? No, that's a real climb. Look.

934
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,610
我知道该去哪里  你...
I know where everything is already, so just--

935
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,580
我会救我们出去的  好吗
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

936
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:04,820
我相信  但我就是担心等你出去了
I believe you but I'm just worried that when you get out,

937
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,210
你会改变主意
you're gonna change your mind,

938
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,010
你不会回来救我了
you're not gonna wanna come back for me.

939
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,210
你会把我扔在这里
You'll just leave me in here 

940
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,320
然后你会报警什么的
and you'll call the cops Or something.

941
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,880
我们只能互相信任了  好吗
We're just gonna have to trust each other, okay?

942
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,830
我不会报警的
I'm not gonna call the cops.

943
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,340
谁会这么做
Who would even do that?

944
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,270
我们经历了这么多
After everything that we've been through?

945
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,170
-我就想离开这里  -我真的很想  我...
- I just wanna get out of here. - I really want to, and I...

946
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:21,960
我...
and I...

947
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,380
我不希望你进监狱
I don't want you to go to jail.

948
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:25,970
你说得对
You know, you're right.

949
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,150
这都是一场误会
It was all a misunderstanding.

950
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:29,890
我会救我们出去的  然后
I'll get us out of there, and then...

951
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,480
然后我们可以去那个度假村
and then we can go to the resort.

952
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:32,730
你知道吗
You know?

953
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,430
阳光天空度假村
Sunny Sky Resort?

954
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,630
拜托
Please.

955
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,840
把你的左脚放上来  好了
Put your left leg right here, here we go.

956
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,140
好了  完美
Okay, perfect.

957
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,880
跨一大步  上去
Big step, up!

958
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,380
你可以的  你可以的  你可以的

959
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,260
太好了  完美
Yes, yes, perfect!

960
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,510
抓稳了  我要把你的脚放在...
Okay, hold on tight, I'm gonna put your foot...

961
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,620
抓稳了  准备好了吗
Okay. Hold on tight, ready?

962
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,700
把右脚放在我的肩膀上
Now, right foot on my shoulder.

963
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,450
完美  好了
Perfect, okay.

964
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,450
准备好了吗  准备好了就踩上去
Ready? And step up when you're ready.

965
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,750
太好了  很好  很好
Great. Good, good, good.

966
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,590
很好  继续  很好
Okay, keep going, nice.

967
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,990
完美  太好了  太好了
Perfect! Yes, yes, yes!

968
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,700
好了
Okay.

969
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,920
上面有一扇门  对吧
There's a door up there, right?

970
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:12,940
对
Yep.

971
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,980
好
Okay, good, okay.

972
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,450
你身后有一架梯子
There's a ladder behind you.

973
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,760
你应该能直接把那扇门推开
Should be able to just push that door right open.

974
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,440
那架梯子能爬上去  你看到了吗
Okay, that ladder goes all the way up, you see it?

975
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,350
去吧  爬上去
Go! Straight up.

976
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,270

00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,720

Fuck, fuck you, you fucking bitch!

你这个贱人
You fucking bitch!

982
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,690
我要杀了你  詹
I will fucking get you, Jen!

983
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,870
我就应该杀了你
I should've killed you!

984
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,600
我就应该杀了你
I could have killed you!

985
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:01,640
你
You.

00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,520
太好了
Yes. Yes!

987
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,020
詹
Hey, Jen, hey!

988
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:16,340
你最好快跑
Oh, you better run...

989
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,050
因为  你要死了
'cause now, you're gonna die.

990
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:30,950
该死
Oh, shit!

991
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,410
你最好赶紧跑
You better fuckin' run!

992
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,610
救命
Help!

993
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,900
拜托
Come on.

994
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,560
拜托
Come on.

995
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,140
你在干什么
What are you doing?

996
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:16,880
后退
Get back.

997
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,530
退回去
Get back.

998
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,100
你踢断了我的鼻子
You broke my nose!

999
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,950
滚开  你这个疯女人
Get off, you crazy bitch!

1000
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:39,470
操
Fuck!

1001
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,990
你难道准备游出去吗
What are you, gonna fucking swim outta here?

1002
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,210
你只会让我们弄得浑身是水或者被电死
All you're gonna do is get us soaked or electrocuted!

1003
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,300
你听到我说话了吗  你明白吗
Are you listening to me? Do you get it?

1004
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,260
没用的
It's not going to work!

1005
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,930
这样应该能通知消防局了
That should cue the fire department.

1006
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,500
混蛋
Fucking asshole.

1007
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:12,050
不久就能出去了
It's not gonna be long now.

1008
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,070
那现在呢
Well, what now?

1009
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,640
你有什么计划
What's the plan?

1010
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,320
不  詹
No, Jen.

1011
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,070

No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Jen.

1013
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,500
詹  看着我  不不不
Jen, look at me, no, no, no.

1014
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,350
停下  停下  停下
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1015
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,790
不不不
No, no, no. No.

1016
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,460
不
No!

1017
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,870
我从来没听过一个成年男人这么求人
I've never heard a grown man beg like that before.

1018
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,250
你有什么想对我说的吗
Did you have something to say to me?

1019
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,250
-谢谢你  -谢什么
- Thank you. - For what?

1020
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,300
谢你没有阉了我
Thank you for not disfiguring me.

1021
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,150
你知道我们要怎么做吗
You know what we're gonna do?

1022
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,420
我们要约法三章
You and I are gonna make a deal.

1023
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,340
最后绝对不能变成
This is not gonna be one of those times when

1024
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:24,040
我们获救后
they finally find us,

1025
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,560
我报警
and then I call the cops,

1026
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,360
我们俩各执一词
and it's your story against mine.

1027
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,380
不可能
No.

1028
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,430
我要确保你要为你对我做的事
I want guarantees, 'cause you're gonna go to 

1029
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,020
而进监狱
fucking jail for what you've done to me. 

1030
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,230
好吧  不要阉了我就行  求求你了
Okay, okay, please, just please don't do it, okay?

1031
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:44,630
现在是2月115日  周日
It's Sunday, february 15th, and...

1032
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,270
我还知道日期的唯一原因是
the only reason why I know this is because

1033
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,650
我在我的手机上看到的
I saw it on my phone.

1034
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,710
我跟一个自称是
I have been trapped in a elevator

1035
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,760
大楼保安的人
with a man who claims to be

1036
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,580
被困在电梯里了
the building security guard.

1037
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,120
他说他的名字叫盖
He says his name is Guy.

1038
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,600
其实不是  对吗
That's not right, is it?

1039
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,240
是的
No.

1040
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:07,710
你叫什么名字
What is your name?

1041
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,120
约翰
It's John.

1042
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,210
你的全名
Your full name.

1043
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,270
约翰·迪金斯
John Deakins.

1044
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,110
这位迪金斯
So Deakins here,

1045
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,700
他会告诉我们到底发生了什么
he's gonna tell us the truth about exactly what happened.

1046
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:21,420
是我让我们被困在电梯里的
I caused us to get stuck in this elevator.

1047
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,520
这不是意外吗
It wasn't an accident?

1048
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,840
是的  是我故意造成的
No, I did it on purpose.

1049
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,410
{\an8}第49楼

1050
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,310
太好了
Yes.

1051
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,280
我趁你不注意时用我的钥匙关停了电梯
I used my key to stop the elevator when you weren't looking.

1052
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:37,370
看看这个
Check out this guy.

1053
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,060
计划不错
Nice plan.

1054
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,940
我觉得有用吗
How did that work out for you?

1055
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,460
我有自愿参与这一切吗
Now, was I a willing participant in any of this?

1056
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,640
没有
No.

1057
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,140
是你把我困在这里的吗
Did you trap me in here?

1058
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,010
-我没有困住你  -说实话
- I didn't trap you. - Tell the truth!

1059
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,550
是的  是的  是我困住了你
Ow! Yes, yes, yes, I trapped you.

1060
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,030
你绑架了我  对吗
So you kidnapped me, right?

1061
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,230
是的  我...我绑架了你
Yes.Yes, I kid... I kidnapped you.

1062
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,990
-坐起来  -不行  我的背
- Sit up. - I can't. My fuckin' back.

1063
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:17,310
-坐起来  -好吧  好吧
- Sit up. - Okay, okay, okay.

1064
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,190
好吧  干什么
Okay, okay, what?

1065
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,610
-你受伤了吗  -是的  是的
- You hurt? - Yes. Yes!

1066
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,730
你伤害了我吗
And did you hurt me?

1067
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,350
在我被困在这里的时候
When I was trapped in here?

1068
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,650
是的
Yes.

1069
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,090
怎么伤害的
How so?

1070
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:36,460
我把你的头撞向地板
I hit your head on the ground...

1071
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:39,760
我掐你
and I choked you.

1072
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,410
然后呢
And?

1073
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,920
然后我把你撞向墙
And I threw you against the wall.

1074
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,150
所以你绑架了我
So you've kidnapped me.

1075
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,040
并进行殴打
Assault and battery.

1076
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,550
为什么
Why?

1077
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,530
你为什么要这么做
Why do all of this?

1078
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,870
因为我想见你  詹
Because I wanted to meet you, Jen.

1079
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,540
那你为什么不像个普通人一样约我出去
So then why didn't you just ask me out like a normal human being?

1080
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,210
因为你不会搭理我的
Because you wouldn't have given me the time of day.

1081
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:03,580
你会拒绝我  我想
You woulda turned me down, and I wanted

1082
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,190
你能好好和我进行对话
a guaranteed conversation with you,

1083
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,550
我希望你能全神贯注
I wanted your undivided attention.

1084
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,590
我觉得我值得你这么对我
I think I deserve that,

1085
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,840
但其实呢  我只是一个保安
but no, I'm just a security guard,

1086
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,750
但是你猜怎么着  我其实也不是保安
but guess what, no, I'm not, I'm not, actually.

1087
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,830
那就是曾经的我
This was me.

1088
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,920
那就是我曾经的人生
This was my fucking life.

1089
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:21,160
约翰·迪金斯  菲尼根的执行副总裁
John Deakins, EVP at Finnegan's,

1090
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,300
所以你才从来没听说过
that's why you've never heard of it,

1091
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,890
因为根本不在这幢楼里
because it's not in this fucking building.

1092
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:27,130
我曾经吹嘘公司里所有男的都想成为我
I used to brag the guys wanna be me at the company,

1093
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,150
所以女的都想上我
the girls wanna bed me at the company.

1094
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,180
你还记得吗  你还记得我和你说的那个性爱故事吗
You remember? You remember that sex story I told you

1095
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,810
把内裤放进手套箱的那个
with the panties in the glove box?

1096
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:34,560
那是真的  詹
That was true, Jen.

1097
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,090
我的那个性感同事
That, that hot coworker of mine?

1098
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,100
她想要我
She wanted me.

1099
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,510
约翰·迪金斯
John Deakins.

1100
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,580
人人都想巴结
Number one with a fuckin' bullet.

1101
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:49,280
但其实故事不仅仅是那样  完整的故事是...
But it's not the whole story, the whole story is that...

1102
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,350
也许是因为酒精
maybe it was the alcohol,

1103
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,980
也许是因为她在车里突然发疯
maybe it was her being freaky in the car,

1104
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,870
我完全没看到高速出口
but I missed that exit entirely

1105
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:01,210
直接开出了车道
and I drove right clean off it,

1106
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,940
冲进了峡谷
right into a ravine.

1107
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:05,210
我的奥迪车翻滚了七圈
I flipped my Audi seven times.

1108
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:09,250
要不是被那棵树挡住了  还会继续往下滚
It would've been more if it wasn't for that tree.

1109
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:15,920
撞击撕裂了她的身体
The impact just obliterated her body.

1110
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,300
当场死亡
Just killed her.

1111
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,980
我的前额撞到了  我只受到
I had a bump on my forehead, that was

1112
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,100
这点伤  然后
my only injury, and then later,

1113
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,020
多亏了我请的超厉害律师
thanks to my fucking amazing lawyer

1114
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,880
还因为我是约翰·迪金斯
and because I'm John fucking Deakins,

1115
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,740
我只在监狱里蹲了六个月
I only got six months in jail.

1116
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,470
但是等我出来以后
But when I got out,

1117
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,770
由于我犯过罪
because I was a convicted felon,

1118
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:39,360
我找不到工作
I couldn't buy myself a job.

1119
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,410
我的积蓄终于用完了  于是
My savings finally ran out, and then,

1120
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,010
我终于委身
I finally bent over

1121
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,800
找了份保安的工作
and got this security gig,

1122
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:49,440
原来的约翰·迪金斯可是根本看不上这种工作的
not something that John Deakins 1.0 would've ever done.

1123
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,400
干了几个月后
After a few months of this shit,

1124
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,240
我受不了了
it was fucking time.

1125
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,580
我想再找回自己的感觉
I wanted to feel like me again,

1126
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,880
我想成为他  好吗
I wanted to be him, right?

1127
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,750
做回我自己
To be me again.

1128
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,010
我曾经那么努力
I worked my whole fucking life for it.

1129
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,820
我就想再找回那种感觉  一会儿也好
I just wanted to feel it, just for a little while.

1130
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:18,900
为什么
Why?

1131
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,420
为什么选我
Just why me?

1132
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,360
因为是你不自觉中
Because you light up the entire building,

1133
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,200
照亮了整幢大楼
you don't even know it.

1134
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,160
你走进大堂
You walked into the lobby

1135
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,930
穿着橘红色的大衣  我恨橘红色
in an orange jacket, I fuckin' hate orange,

1136
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,620
这是世界上最难看的颜色
it's the worst fuckin' color in the world,

1137
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,690
但是这也无所谓
but it didn't matter,

1138
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,810
因为那根本比不上你带来的光亮
'cause it can't compete with you.

1139
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,320
这就是原因
Anyways, that's why.

1140
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,440
{\an8}周一  2月16日  凌晨1点15分

1141
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,620
等你看到这风景后就都值了
It's gonna be worth it when you see this view.

1142
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,580
到了吗  我们快到了吗
Is this it? Are we almost there?

1143
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,500
就快了
So close.

1144
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,970
你最好别骗我
It better be.

1145
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,190
你到底还来不来
Are you comin' or what?

1146
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,110
拜托  宝贝  这里又潮又冷  我累坏了
Come on, baby, it's cold and wet and I'm exhausted!

1147
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,740
我们不能直接回你家去吗
Can't we just go back to your place?

1148
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,970
不不不  你肯定会喜欢的
No, no, no! You're gonna love this!

1149
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:39,960
来吧
Come on.

1150
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,190
这里真的没有人吗
There's really no one here?

1151
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,740
我和你说了
Already told you,

1152
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,810
只有一个我的同事
just one of the dudes I work with.

1153
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,710
没什么好担心的
Nothing to worry about.

1154
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,930
