你不是上帝

33
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,750
我们为什么停下了
Why have we stopped?

34
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,850
有种奇怪的东西叫人类
There's these weird things called human beings

35
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,870
我们午餐时会饿的

36
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,750
就这破地方吗
Here, this shithole?

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,460
算了吧  我就不去了

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,630
爸爸说五分钟内进去

关上门
Close the door!

40
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,810

How nice is this?

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,020
我们三个一起上路
Three of us on the open road.

42

我们有三个人吗
There's three of us?

43

她不恨我们
She does not hate us.

46
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,070
她就是到青春期了
She's just a teenager.

47
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,120
这年纪就这样
Kind of goes with the territory.

48
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,580
等你到了她的年纪时就会理解了
You'll understand one day when you're her age.

49
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,080
如果我那么情绪化就杀了我好了
Kill me if I ever get that moody.

50
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,710
你俩啊
I swear

51
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,800
真是太不一样了
you two couldn't be more different,

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,510
但你们又都像你们的妈妈
and yet you're both just like your mama.

53
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,390
她会喜欢这样的
She would have loved this.

54
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,600
爸爸
Dad?

55
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,020
我不希望你死
I don't want you to die.

56
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,780
我哪都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

57
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,630
如果发生了坏事呢
What if something bad happens?

58
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,740
不会发生坏事的
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

59
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,370
我保证
I promise.

60
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,450
拉钩发誓
Pinky swear?

61
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,210
来吧
Come on.

62
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,060
{\an8}父亲节特餐免费

63
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,980
要我给你续杯吗
Would you like me to top it off?

64
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,170
安静
Be quiet.

65
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,680
灵力需要最大程度的精神集中
Psychic powers require maximum focus.

66
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,760
你举着
You're holding up...

67
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,680
三根手指
Three fingers!

68
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,890
错了
Wrong.

69
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,620
-你作弊了  -你才作弊了
- You cheated! - You cheated!

70
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,210
你本来举着三根手指  但你放下了一根
You had three fingers and you put one down.

71
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,230
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

72
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,000
你肯定是透过手指偷瞄了
That means you were peeking through the fingers then.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,170
我才没透过手指偷瞄
I was not peeking through my fingers.

74
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,880
-那你怎么知道的  -你变了
- Then how did you know? - You switched it.

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,450
你怎么知道的  你有灵力吗
How do you know, are you psychic?

76
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,010
你是说你真有灵力
So you're saying that you're actually a psychic.

77
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,130
或许是呢
Maybe I am, maybe I am.

78
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,880
好吧  那告诉我
All right, then I need to know

79

非常感激
Thank you so much.

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,660
你真不想要点吗
You sure you don't want anything?

83
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,750
-不  -薄煎饼呢
- Nope. - Want some pancakes?

84
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,460
不要  我不饿
Nope, I'm not hungry.

85
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,920
你还好吗
You feel okay?

86
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,340
嗯
Yup.

87

你打算吃点薄煎饼
You gonna have any pancake

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,470
就那么多的糖浆  还是...
with your syrup, or you're just...

89
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,110
直接喝糖浆了
gonna go straight liquid?

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
别乱说我  我喜欢糖浆
Don't judge me. I like syrup.

91
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,580
要不要我打开盖子
Do you just want me to take the lid off

92
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,380
你好直接都倒在上面
so you can just pour it all directly straight on there?

93
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,740
那或许会简单些
Might be easier.

94
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,280
怎么了
What?

95
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,660
你是怕有人偷走它吗
Are you afraid someone's gonna steal it?

96
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,850
怎么  让你不爽吗  茜茜
Why, does it bother you, Sissy?

97
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,020
首先  内森
Firstly, Nathan,

你可以别喊我"茜茜"吗  我不是7岁了
can you not call me "Sissy" because I'm not seven.

99
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,300
父亲节这天你都不能喊他爸爸吗
Can't you call him "Dad" even on Father's Day?

100
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,190
你还记得
You remembered!

101
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,300
好了  你给我准备了什么

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,450
-你想抱吗  -天呐

105

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,320
我们的容器选择很多
we have a wide range of receptacles.

115
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,370
你们觉得呢  孩子们
What do you think, girls?

116
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,460
都好难看
They're ugly.

117
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,840
我觉得她一个都不会喜欢的
I don't think she'd have liked any of them.

118
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,180
她有什么特别喜欢的颜色吗
Is there a particular color that she was fond of?

119
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,270
她一向喜欢好红酒

I like it back here.

130
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,510
不颠吗
Isn't it bumpy?

131
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,340
你给我买棉花糖了吗
Did you get my marshmallows?

132
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,180
这里安静
It's quiet.

133
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,740
但不怎么安全
But it's not that safe.

134
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,660
谢谢你的理解
Thank you so much for your understanding.

135
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,060
我觉得这样不合法
I don't think it's legal.

136
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,360
别撞到路上的坑了

137

就是这里了
So this is the-- the spot.

139
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
真美丽  是吧
It's really something, isn't it?

140
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,130
没有信号
There's no service.

141
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,130
你要给我们讲那个故事吗
Are you gonna tell us the story?

142
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,470
17年前  我认识你们妈妈时
So, 17 years ago, when I met your mama,

143
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
我们一起公路旅行
we took a road trip

144
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,810
就走的我们现在走的这条路
following the same path we're on now.

145
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,730
一样的加油站  一样的餐馆
Same gas station, same diner.

146
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,500
妈妈吃薄煎饼了吗
Did Mom have the pancakes?

147
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,690
当然了
You know she had the pancakes.

148
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,650
我们不知道我们要去哪
See, we didn't know where we were goin',

149
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,010
我们就是想这样
and that was kind of the idea.

150
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,120
我们只想在开阔公路上
We just wanted to be on the open road,

151
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,870
自由自在
total freedom.

152
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,950
我们停在了这里
So we stopped here.

153
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,080
一起喝了一瓶酒
We drank a bottle of wine together.

154
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,710
然后我带你妈
And then I walked Mom...

155
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,050
站在了克莱尔站的那个地方
right there where Claire's standing...

156
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,680
我没有戒指什么的  但
I didn't have a ring or anything, but...

157
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,260
我向她求婚了
I asked her to marry me.

158
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,970
没有
So, no,

159
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,430
这里本来没什么特别的
there wasn't anything special about this place.

160
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,190
但现在它特别了
But there is now.

161
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,650
我们就让她在这里安息
And this is where we'll lay her to rest.

162
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,820
迟了一年
Yeah, about a year late.

163
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,530
好了
All right.

164
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,660
我们收拾行李吧
Let's get unpacked.

165
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,470
小玛  你去拿上外套吧
Mags, why don't you grab your jacket

166
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,870
这里有点冷了
since it's gettin' a little chilly?

167
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,870
也拿我的外套来
Grab mine too, would you?

168
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,870
亲爱的
Hi baby.

169
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,960
我要六点之后才能下班回家
I'm not gonna be back from work till after six,

170
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,300
所以你可以给玛姬做点晚饭吗
so can you please make Maggie some dinner?

171
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
冰箱里有意面
There's pasta in the fridge.

172
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,280
你只需要加热就行
All you have to do is literally just heat it up.

173
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,010
我睡觉前会回去的
I will be back for bedtime.

174
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,620
爸爸也会回去  但你知道他的厨艺什么样
Dad'll be home, but you know what his cooking is like.

175
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,250
还有
And...

176
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,130
昨晚的事抱歉
I'm sorry about last night.

177
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,390
我们吵得毫无意义
That was a stupid fight.

178
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,060
我知道你爱我的
I know you love me.

179
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,810
我也爱你
And I love you.

180
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,060
好了  我得走了
Okay, I gotta go.

181
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,600
我爱你  亲爱的
I love you, sweetheart.

182
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,440
快点  你在里面待一小时了
Hurry up, you've been in there an hour!

183
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,400
等一下  玛格特
One second, Maggot!

184
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,860
{\an8}无网络服务

185
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,940

Oh, fuck.

187
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,430

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,390
妈妈
Hey Mom.

189
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,020
我们来到你和爸爸最爱的地点了
We made it to you and Dad's favorite spot.

190
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,650
好想你
Miss you.

191
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,920
你还好吗
You okay?

192

帮我做晚饭啊
Help me make dinner?

194
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,840
好  就去
Sure, in a second.

195
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,090
好
Okay.

196
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,080
你是电影里的吗
Are you in a movie?

197
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,540
你是女人吗
Are you a woman?

198
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,250
不是  等等
No. Wait.

199
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,880
不是
No.

200
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,430
你是人类吗

不是
Nope.

202

你是机器人吗

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,600
是的
Yes.

204
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,520
你最好的朋友也是机器人吗
Is your best friend a robot?

205
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,440
可能吧
Maybe.

206
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,990
你最好的朋友
Does your best friend

207
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,740
会指使你吗
boss you around?

208
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,090
-是的  -天呐
- Yep. - Oh my God.

209
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,090
快说出来吧
Just say it already!

210
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,050
你...
Are you...

211
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,800
R2D2吗
R2-D2?

212
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
爸爸又赢了
Dad wins once again!

213
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,460
震惊啊
Shocker...

214
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,430
你就是大姨妈了才这么尖酸
You're just bitter 'cause you're on your period.

215
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,500
好了
All right.

216
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,690
天呐  我不知道
Oh God, I don't know

217
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,320
你和妈妈怎么受得了这里
how you and Mom could stand it out here.

218
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,340
六月份还这么冷
It's freezing and it's June.

219
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,350
是啊
Well...

220
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,640
我们还有彼此嘛
We had each other

221
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,350
我们偎依在了一起
and we snuggled.

222
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,190
爸爸
Hey Dad?

223
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,610
我能闻闻你的啤酒吗
Can I smell your beer?

224
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,160
你能闻闻我的啤酒吗
Can you smell my beer?

225
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,840
别激动  我只是好奇

闻起来像克莱尔
It smells like Claire.

227
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,180
闭嘴  玛格特
Shut up, Maggot.

228
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,980
茜茜
Hey Sissy?

229
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,740
内森
Nathan?

230
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,280
你在写什么
What you writing?

231
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,950
可能是给她傻逼男朋友的信
Probably a letter to her stupid boyfriend.

232
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,470
你来到这世上
Were you put on this earth

233
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,880
就是逼我自杀的吗
to make me wanna kill myself?

234
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,260
如果是的话  你会自杀吗
If I was, would you do it?

235
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,720
你的睡觉时间是不是过了
Isn't it past your bedtime?

236
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,430
我没有睡觉时间  你的睡觉时间是不是过了
I don't have a bedtime. Isn't it past your bedtime?

237
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,850
你有睡觉时间  因为我没有
Yeah, you do, No, 'cause I don't have one.

238
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,770
-我没有睡觉时间  -你有
- I don't have a bedtime.  - Yes you do!

239
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,190

- Yes-- no I don't! - Don't!

240
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,460
我没有睡觉时间  你承认了
I don't have a bedtime, you admit it!

241
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,040
这个男孩
So this boy.

242
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,120
他很特别吗
Is he special?

243
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,590
对我来说是的
To me he is, yeah.

244
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,170
那为什么不让我们见见
Then why haven't we met him?

245
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,340
因为我想让他喜欢我
Because I want him to like me.

246
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,770
怎么了
What?

247
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,490
我的嘴唇很干  我还没有唇膏
My lips are dry and I don't have any chapstick.

248
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,950
你妈妈和她的口红
Your mom and her lipstick.

249
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,750
我不知道你还记不记得  你当时还小
I don't know if you remember. You were little.

250
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,580
但你以前经常和你妈妈坐在一起
But you used to sit with your mom,

251
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,890
你们俩都坐在镜子前
both of you plopped down in front of the mirror,

252
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,040
然后一起化妆
and you guys would put on your makeup together.

253
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,710
是的  我记得
Yeah, I remember.

254
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,970
妈妈看起来很漂亮
Mom looked so beautiful.

255
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,020
但是...
And...

256
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,850
我看起来像个小丑
I looked like a clown.

257
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,150
可爱的小丑
Cute clown.

258
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,280
妈妈真是太美了
Mom was gorgeous.

259
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,000
是的  她是
Yes, she was.

00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,730
克莱尔

261
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,040
-茜茜  -别碰我

262
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,750
我也不想让她走  克莱尔
I didn't want to let her go, Claire.

263
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,710
你必须知道这点
You have to know that.

264
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,670
我不想谈论这个
I don't wanna talk about this.

265
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,720
你怎么知道她已经没救了
How do you know that there's no way to save her?

266
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,230
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

267
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,220
这是我这辈子做的最艰难的决定
It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make

268
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,650
我知道你们俩...
knowing that you two girls--

269
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,450
我说了  我不想谈论这个
I said that I don't want to talk about this.

270
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,390
你不是上帝  内森
You're not God, Nathan!

271
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,650
是你杀了她
You're just the one who's killing her!

272
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,690
克莱尔
Claire.

273
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,570
我们得谈谈这事
We have to talk about it.

274
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,880
她当时已经很痛苦了  亲爱的
She was in so much pain, honey.

275
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,780
这不是这趟旅途的目的
That's not what this trip is about.

276
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,990
我只想让你...
I just want you to...

277
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,700
亲爱的  别进去
Sweetheart, don't go inside.

278
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,580
克莱尔
Hey Claire.

279
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,290
克莱尔
Claire!

280
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,500
我不知道如何弥补  瓦尔
I don't know how to fix this, Val.

281
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,680
茜茜
Sissy?

282
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,180
你在干什么
What are you doing?

283
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,390
宝贝
Honey?

284
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,730
你还好吗

没事的
Hey, shh, it's okay.

286
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,320
来  躺下吧
Come on, let's lie down.

287
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,530
你没事的  睡吧
You're okay. Come on.

288
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,940
怎么了  宝贝
What is it, honey?

289
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,920
有人在车顶上
There's somebody--there's someone on the roof!

290
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,110
-什么  -我看见...

宝贝  没人能上去  什么...
Baby, nobody can get up there. What--

295
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,000
爸爸
Dad?

296
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,180
-出什么事了  -我不知道
- What is that? - I don't know.

297
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,260
过来坐在你姐姐旁边
Come over and sit down next to your sissy.

298
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,940
有人吗
Hello?

299
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,030

请让我们进去
Please let us in.

301
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,010
谁在外面
Who's out there?

302
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,640
爸爸
Dad?

303
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,150
没事的  宝贝  没事的
It's okay, honey, all right?

304
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,450
天哪
Jesus.

305
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,240
请你们开开门吧
Please will you open the door?

306
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,580
有什么事
What's the problem?

307
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,370
我们想给你们看个东西
We want to show you something.

308
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,540
他们看起来好奇怪
They look really weird.

309
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,890
别开门
Don't.

310
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,450
如果他们真的需要帮助怎么办
What if they really need help?

311
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,140
闭嘴  玛姬
Shut up, Maggie!

312
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,530
别开门
Don't...don't open it.

313
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,810
我在加油站见过她
I saw her at the gas station.

314
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,940
我觉得她在跟踪我们
I think that she followed us.

315
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,150
那里离这里有80公里
That was like 50 miles back!

316
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,090
听着...
Listen, um...

317
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,130
我们不能让你们进来
We can't let you in.

318
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,720
因为已经很晚了
You know, it's late.

319
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,100
如果你们需要电话
If you guys need a phone,

320
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,720
你们可以去高速上
uh, you might want to make your way up to the highway.

321
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,600
我们最终会让你们出来的
We'll make you come out eventually.

322
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,980
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

323
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,420
我觉得她们走了
I think they're gone.

324
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,670
你又不知道
You don't know that.

325
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,730
-她们只是孩子  -闭嘴  你个小...
- It's just kids.  - Shut up, you little--

326
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,640
-克莱尔  -怎么了
- Hey, Claire! - What?

327
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,570
你把我们带来这里
You dragged us all the way out here,

328
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,570
而现在我们被困在一个不知名的地方
and now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere

329
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,180
还不知道外面有什么
with who knows what outside.

330
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,080
只是想告诉你
Just so you know,

331
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,150
没人想来这趟旅行
nobody wanted to go on this trip.

332
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,960
克莱尔  这趟旅行是为了妈妈
Claire, this trip was for Mom.

333
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,280
是啊  可是你猜怎么着
Right, well, guess what?

334
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,610
妈妈死了
Mom's dead.

335
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,170
小玛  你可真行
Mags-- real nice.

336
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,410
小玛
Hey Mags.

337
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,620
宝贝
Honey.

338
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,050
你在干什么
What are you doing?

339
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,400
我得确定她们走了
I'm gonna go make sure they're gone.

340
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,900
-别去  -你为什么不过去
- Don't go-- - Why don't you go back there

341
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,470
向你的妹妹道歉
and apologize to your sister?

342
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,450
玛姬  你能出来吗
Maggie, can you come out?

343
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,870
玛姬
Maggie...

344
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,530
走开
Go away!

345
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,690
玛姬  对不起
Maggie, I'm sorry.

346
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,030
玛姬
Maggie.

347
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,370
我觉得她们走了
Think they're gone.

348
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,340
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

349
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,970
好了  二位
All right, guys.

350
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,260
希望我们把她们吓跑了
Hopefully we scared 'em off.

351
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,470
我们回去睡觉吧
Let's go back to bed.

352
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,520
那里吗  不行
There? No.

353
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,440
绝对不行
No way.

354
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,600
你想睡床吗
Do you want to take the bunk?

355
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,980
那你呢
What about you?

356
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,440
我继续放哨
I am gonna keep watch.

357
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,900
以防那些混蛋再来敲门
In case those punks come knocking again.

358
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,450
我们要打得她们满地找牙
We'll give 'em a mouthful of teeth.

359
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,580
休息会儿吧
Get some rest.

360
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,540
明天是个重要的日子  对吗
Tomorrow's a big day, okay?

361
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,000
好了
All right.

362
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,390
克莱尔
Hey, Claire.

363
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,600
来吧
Come on.

364
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,980
没事的  来吧
It's okay, come on.

365
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,200
是那两个孩子干的
The kids?

366
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,660
还能是谁
Who else?

367
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,830
-操他妈的  -注意言辞
- Fuck! - Watch your mouth.

368
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,290
好吧
All right.

369
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,670
高速路就在几公里外
Highway's just a few miles back.

370
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,810
我一有信号  就打电话叫人来帮忙
Soon as I get reception I'll call for help

371
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,300
否则我就叫人来帮我们
or I'll flag somebody down.

372
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,760
你要把我俩留在这里吗
You're leaving us here?

373
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,720
小玛走不了那么远
Mags can't make that hike.

374
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,780
车的事别告诉她
And don't tell her about the truck.

375
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,560
希望我能在她醒来之前回来
Hopefully I'll be back before she wakes up.

376
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,730
我需要你在这里陪你妹妹
I need you to stay here with your sister.

377
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,570
如果她们回来了怎么办
What if they come back?

378
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,210
那你要跑进拖车把门锁上
You're gonna get in that trailer and you're gonna lock the door

379
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,200
在我回来之前待在里面
and you're gonna stay in there till I get back.

380
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,280
好吗
Okay?

381
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,830
测试测试
One, one, one, one, one.

382
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,830
好的
Okay.

383
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,370
好  你们俩待在拖车里
All right, you guys just stay in the trailer.

384
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,250
我会在早饭前回来  好吗
I'll be back before breakfast, okay?

385
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,050
怎么了
What is it?

386
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,550
没什么
Um, it's, uh, nothing.

387
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,970
-你确定吗  -确定
- You sure? - Yeah.

388
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,680
好
Okay.

389
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:53,310
{\an8}致妈妈
你过得怎么样  我们正在旅行

390
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,060
{\an8}我现在很困惑

391
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:05,240
{\an8}这趟旅途太悲伤了
如果你能回来的话
这是最蠢的一次旅行

392
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:11,200
{\an8}我想你了  妈妈

393
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,360
你在干什么
What are you doin'?

394
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,900
不关你的事
None of your business.

395
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,070
告诉你男朋友  没有他你活不下去吗
Telling your boyfriend you can't live without him?

396
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,830
你想干什么
What do you want?

397
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,950
爸爸在哪里
Where's Dad?

398
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,430
他去爬个山
Uh, he went for a hike.

399
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,540
他说他会在早饭的时候回来
He said he'll be back for breakfast.

400
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,130
我饿了
Well, I'm hungry now.

401
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,350
他为什么不叫醒我
And why didn't he wake me up?

402
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,550
我就会和他一起去了
I would have gone with him.

403
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,230
他说他想让你留在这里
He said that he wanted you to stay here,

404
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,970
而且是他说了算  所以...
and he's the boss, so...

405
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,760
你向我隐瞒了什么事情
Something's going on you're not telling me.

406
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,970
我不是小孩子
I'm not a kid.

407
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,600
你就是个小孩子
Yes, you are a kid.

408
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,980
你想用对讲机联系他吗
Okay, do you want to try him on the walkie?

409
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,150
我想
Yeah.

410
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,740
就...
Just...

411
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,610
爸爸  你收到了吗  完毕
Dad, do you read? Over.

412
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,740
我是玛姬
It's Maggie.

413
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,160
试着再说一次"完毕"
Try saying "Over" again.

414
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,250
我是玛姬  完毕
It's Maggie. Over.

415
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,550
他为什么不回答
Why isn't he answering?

416
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,970
你在吗  完毕
You there? Over.

417
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,120
他肯定走出范围了
Uh, he must be out of range.

418
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,190
你不知道
You don't know that.

419
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,900
如果他迷路了呢
What if he got lost?

420
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,980
或摔倒了
Or fell?

421
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,840
或被蛇咬了
Or got bit by a snake?

422
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
你知道响尾蛇一秒就能
Did you know rattlesnakes can strike up to three meters

423
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,090
窜出三米多吗
in under one second?

424
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,420
-玛姬  -那比爸爸跑得快多了
- Maggie-- - That's way faster than Dad can even move.

425
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,490
玛姬
Maggie, it...

426
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
会没事的  好吗
It'll be fine, okay?

427
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,080
去穿衣服吧
Just go and get dressed.

428
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,810
内森  你在吗
Nathan, you there?

429
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,130
还担心吗
Still worried?

430
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
你觉得呢
What do you think?

431
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,090
他马上会回来的
He'll be back soon.

432
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,350
我能玩吗
Can I play?

433
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,640
这不是玩具
It's not a toy.

434
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,820
没有妈妈的人偶吗
No figure of Mom, huh?

435
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,940
做得很好
It's really nice.

436
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,400
你这么认为吗
You think so?

437
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,660
你一直带在身边吗
Do you keep it with you all the time?

438
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,240
嗯  那又怎样
Yeah, so?

439
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,870
我觉得这很机智
I think that's really smart.

440
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,040
这样妈妈就能一直照顾你了
That way Mom can always look out for you.

441
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,410
想帮我在院子里做个狗屋吗
Want to help me make a dog house for the yard?

442
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,290
我们没有狗
We don't have a dog.

443
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,330
是的  但小女孩能做梦
No, but a girl can dream.

444
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,000
好吧
Okay.

445
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,300
已经做好了狗的脸

532
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,300
过来  过来

533
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,170
我以为听到了你的声音  所以出去了
I thought I heard you outside and I went out there.

534
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,090
我还丢了一个人偶

535
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,320
听着  你不能离开拖车

Do you understand?

538
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,350
这是你的娃娃
Here's your doll.

539
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,250
你说过你不会离开我  你保证过的

540
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,990
玛姬  我正在回来的路上
Maggie, I was coming back.

541
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,030
我只是想找信号
I was just trying to go find signal.

542
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,420
对不起
I'm sorry.

543
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,470
没关系
It's okay.

544
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,450
听着  除非和我在一起  否则不许离开拖车
Listen, you cannot leave this trailer unless you're with me.

545
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,010
你俩都是
That goes for both of you.

546
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,940
我们现在怎么办
What do we do now?

547
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,280
我们走不了
We can't leave.

548
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,990
卡车发动不起来
Truck won't start.

549
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,070
所以我们在这过夜
So, we'll stay here tonight.

550
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,160
明天一早
And then tomorrow morning,

551
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,960
我们三人一起走到大路上去
all of us will hike up to the road.

552
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,880
那和妈妈道别呢
What about saying goodbye to Mom?

553
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,970
她得等等了
She's gonna have to wait.

554
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,570
我今天之前出去时
When I went on the hike earlier today,

555
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,200
找到一辆拖车
I found a trailer

556
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,410
里面有个死人
and there was a dead man inside of it.

557
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,700
他怎么了
What happened to him?

558
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,710
他  他自杀了
He, uh, he killed himself.

559
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,090
但我觉得他是被那些孩子害死的
But I think those kids made him do it.

560
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,630
好像那些孩子在刺激他出去
It's like they were daring him to go outside.

561
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:05,180
{\an8}我们能进去吗

562
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,510
她们想要什么
What do they want?

563
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,270
我不知道
I don't know.

564
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:21,980
你为什么去垃圾场
What made you go to the junkyard?

565
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:25,860
玛姬不见了  我听见那边传来她的声音
Maggie was missing and I heard her voice up there.

566
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,860
我找到了她的娃娃
I found her doll.

567
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,910
我不知道这是怎么回事
I don't understand what's going on.

568
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,540
我觉得她们想引我们出去
I think they're trying to lure us out.

569
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,210
如果她们今晚来敲门
If they come knocking again tonight,

570
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,040
你俩别离开拖车
you two do not leave this trailer.

571
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,460
无论如何都不行
No matter what.

572
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,560

573

579
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,340
她肯定会喜欢的
Oh, yeah, she'd love that.

580
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,680
这些是灯吗
Are they the lights?

581
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,440

粉色的  我想她会喜欢
It's pink, I thought she would like it.

583
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,910
你觉得这些太闪了吗
Do you think these are too sparkly?

584
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:37,620
有"太闪了"这种说法吗
Is there a such thing as too sparkly?

585
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,630
这是个惊喜  所以别说漏了
And it's a surprise, so don't say anything.

586

快到睡觉时间了
It's almost bed time.
