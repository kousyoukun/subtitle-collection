1
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,350
走开
Get the fuck off me.

2
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,990
你怎么知道没办法救她
How do you know that there's no way to save her?

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,160
你不是上帝
You're not God!

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,460
内森
Nathan!

5
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,800
就是你害了她
You're just the one who's killing her!

6
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,560
让她在这等着我*
*Tell her to wait right here for me

7
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,480
我想尽快回来*
*I'll try to get right back

8
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,110
现在我就只能看到她的拒绝*
*Right now her no is all I see

9
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,370
像是活在陷阱里一样*
*Like living in a trap

10
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,170
告诉她我需要自己一个人静一静*
*Tell her I need some time alone

11
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,300
花点时间理清头绪*
*Some time to work things out

12
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,050
告诉她等我回到家*
*Tell her when I come back home

13
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,180
我会把我们过去的快乐时光带回来*
*I'll bring our good times back

14
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,560
我明白*
*I get it

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,940
你是认真的*
*You meant it

16
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,820
没关系  我们不会后悔*
*That's cool, we'll never regret it

17
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,700
在悲伤中我们已度过了风暴*
*By morning this storm had moved on

18
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,960
毫无预警*
*Gave me no warning

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,590
一切都会好起来*
*It's gonna be all right

20
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,610
只需要一晚安宁*
*Oh, but it's gonna take all night

21
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,450
一切都会好起来*
*It's gonna be okay

22
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,590
今天就会出现转机*
Today is not that day

23
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,610
我们怎么停下来了
Uh, why have we stopped?

24
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,650
有种奇怪的生物叫做人类
There's these weird things called human beings

25
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,910
我们时不时会饿
and we get hungry at lunch time.

26
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,250
这  就这个破地方
Here, this shithole?

27
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,500
算了  我这次就算了
Yeah, no thanks, I'll sit this one out.

28
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,380
爸爸让你
Dad said be inside

29
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,840
五分钟之内进去
in five minutes.

30
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,010
把门关上
Hey, close the door!

31
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,780
这样多好
How nice is this?

32
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,120
我们三个一块出来公路旅行
Three of us on the open road.

33
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,410
我们三个
There's three of us?

34
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,920
态度好点
Be nice.

35
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,550
爸  她讨厌我们
Dad, she hates us.

36
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,260
他不讨厌我们
She does not hate us.

37
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,260
她就是到了叛逆期了
She's just a teenager.

38
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,060
该到了不听话的时候了
Kind of goes with the territory.

39
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,440
等你到了她那个年纪你就明白了
You'll understand one day when you're her age.

40
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,820
如果我那么反复无常就杀了我吧
Kill me if I ever get that moody.

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,000
我发誓你们俩
I swear you two

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,250
天差地别
couldn't be more different,

43
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,170
但是你们都像你们的妈妈
and yet you're both just like your mama.

44
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,060
她肯定会喜欢一起出来旅行的
She would have loved this.

45
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,820
爸
Dad?

46
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,860
怎么了
Huh?

47
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,330
我不希望你死
I don't want you to die.

48
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,590
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

49
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,510
要是出了什么坏事呢
What if something bad happens?

50
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,100
不会出什么坏事
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

51
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,270
我保证
I promise.

52
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,400
拉勾勾
Pinky swear?

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,780
来吧
Come on.

54
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,830
需要加满吗
Would you like me to top it off?

55
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,100
安静
Be quiet.

56
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,390
心灵感应需要精神高度集中
Psychic powers require maximum focus.

57
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,520
你举着
You're holding up...

58
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,900
三根手指
Three fingers!

59
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,860
错了
Wrong.

60
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,530
- 你作弊  - 你才作弊
\ You cheated! \ You cheated!

61
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,030
你之前举着三根然后放下来了一根
You had three fingers and you put one down.

62
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,040
你是怎么知道的
How do you know that?

63
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,910
那意味着你透过手指缝
That means you were peeking

64
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,040
偷看了
through the fingers then.

65
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,290
我没偷看
I was not peeking through my fingers.

66
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,670
- 那你是怎么知道的  - 你变手了
- Then how did you know? - You switched it.

67
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,300
你怎么知道  你能心灵感应
How do you know, are you psychic?

68
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,430
你是说你真的能读心
So you're saying that you're actually a psychic.

69
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,760
也许就是呢  没准就是这样
Maybe I am, maybe I am.

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,680
那我需要知道
All right, then I need to know

71
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
这周末的比赛谁会赢
who's gonna win the game this weekend.

72
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,060
- 给你  亲爱的  - 谢谢
- Here you go, honey. - Thank you.

73
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,320
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

74
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,900
你确定什么都不要
You sure you don't want anything?

75
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,070
- 不要  - 不来点煎饼吗
\ Nope. \ Want some pancakes?

76
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,830
不了  我不饿
Nope, I'm not hungry.

77
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,540
你还好吗
You feel okay?

78
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,630
没事
Yup.

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,930
你到底还吃不吃兼并了
You gonna have any pancake

80
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,810
还是说
with your syrup, or you're just...

81
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,940
你打算直接喝糖浆
gonna go straight liquid?

82
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,900
别说我
Don't judge me.

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,190
我喜欢糖浆
I like syrup.

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,580
用不用我给你把盖子拧开
Do you just want me to take the lid off

85
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,330
好让你直接倒出来
so you can just pour it all directly straight on there?

86
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,420
那样还容易点
Might be easier.

87
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,730
怎么了
What?

88
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,730
你担心有人偷车吗
Uh, are you afraid someone's gonna steal it?

89
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,610
怎么了  你担心了吗  茜茜
Why, does it bother you, Sissy?

90
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,950
首先  内森
Firstly, Nathan,

91
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,120
你能不能别叫我茜茜了  我又不是小孩子了
can you not call me "Sissy" because I'm not seven.

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,960
你就不能在父亲节叫他爸吗
Can't you call him "Dad" even on Father's Day?

93
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
你还记得
Hey, you remembered!

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,090
你给我准备了什么
All right, what'd you get me?

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,600
一个大大的拥抱
A super big hug.

96
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
起开
Get out of here.

97
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,350
- 你想要拥抱吗  - 天呐
- You want a hug? - Oh my God.

98
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,600
你  别过来
You\\ oh\\ no!

99
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,560
你们太奇怪饿了
You guys are so weird.

100
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,940
父亲节快乐
Happy Father's Day.

101
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,610
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

102
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,110
瞧
Look at that.

103
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,830
父亲节奶昔
A little Father's Day milkshake.

104
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,840
如你所见
SALESPERSON: As you can see,

105
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,760
我们由很多种类的花座
we have a wide range of receptacles.

106
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,220
你们觉得怎么样  姑娘们
What do you think, girls?

107
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,270
这些丑死了
They're ugly.

108
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,740
我觉得他哪个都不喜欢
I don't think she'd have liked any of them.

109
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,010
她生前有没有特别喜欢的颜色
Is there a particular color that she was fond of?

110
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,900
她一直很喜欢红色
She always loved a good red.

111
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,310
女士
Miss?

112
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
不用找了
Keep the change.

113
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,670
你为什么不和我们一起到前面来坐
Why don't you ride up front with us?

114
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,420
我喜欢在后面呆着
I like it back here.

115
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,720
不颠吗
Isn't it bumpy?

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,220
你给我带了棉花糖吗
Did you get my marshmallows?

117
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,650
后面安静
It's quiet.

118
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,690
但是不安全
But it's not that safe.

119
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,450
多谢你们的理解
Thank you so much for your understanding.

120
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,660
我觉得这样不合法
I don't think it's legal.

121
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,080
我们尽量不碰到陷坑
We'll try not to hit any potholes!

122
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,040
别闹了
Cut it out!

123
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,030
这里就是  目的地了
So this is the\\ the spot.

124
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,780
别有风味  不是吗
It's really something, isn't it?

125
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,500
这没信号
There's no service.

126
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,380
你打算给我们讲故事吗
Are you gonna tell us the story?

127
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,050
17年前
So, 17 years ago,

128
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,060
我遇到了你们的母亲
when I met your mama,

129
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,310
我们当时沿着现在走的这条路
we took a road trip

130
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,690
进行公路旅行
following the same path we're on now.

131
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,200
一样的加油站  一样的晚餐
Same gas station, same diner.

132
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,290
妈妈吃了煎饼吗
Did Mom have the pancakes?

133
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,210
你知道她吃了
You know she had the pancakes.

134
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,550
我们不知道要去向何方
See, we didn't know where we were goin',

135
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,720
但我们有意如此
and that was kind of the idea.

136
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,600
我们就想行驶在公路上
We just wanted to be on the open road,

137
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,430
享受自由
total freedom.

138
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,730
我们在这里停下
So we stopped here.

139
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,690
一起喝了一瓶葡萄酒
We drank a bottle of wine together.

140
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,200
然后我走到你们母亲身边
And then I walked Mom...

141
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,960
就在克莱尔站的地方
right there where Claire's standing...

142
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,840
我当时都没准备戒指
I didn't have a ring or anything,

143
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,930
但是  我要她嫁给我
but... I asked her to marry me.

144
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,730
所以说
So, no,

145
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,570
当时这个地方确实没什么特别的
there wasn't anything special about this place.

146
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,110
但是现在不一样了
But there is now.

147
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,580
我们就在这里让她安息
And this is where we'll lay her to rest.

148
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,750
都一年过去了
Yeah, about a year late.

149
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,510
好了
All right.

150
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,140
把行李拿下来吧
Let's get unpacked.

151
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,270
小玛  天气有点凉了
Mags, why don't you grab your jacket

152
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,230
你去把你的夹克拿出来
since it's gettin' a little chilly?

153
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,360
把我的也拿出来  好吗
Grab mine too, would you?

154
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,120
亲爱的
Hi baby.

155
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,410
我六点之后
I'm not gonna be back from work

156
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,750
才能回家
till after six,

157
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,920
你能不能帮小玛做点晚餐
so can you please make Maggie some dinner?

158
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,300
冰箱里有通心粉
There's pasta in the fridge.

159
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,930
你只需要热一下就行了
All you have to do is iterally just heat it up.

160
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,690
我在睡觉前就回来了
Um, I will be back for bedtime.

161
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,900
爸爸会先回去  但是你也知道他的厨艺
Dad'll be home, but you know what his cooking is like.

162
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,920
And...还有

163
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,670
昨晚的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about last night.

164
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,180
那场架吵的毫无意义
That was a stupid fight.

165
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,520
我知道你爱我
I know you love me.

166
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,060
我也爱你
And I love you.

167
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,190
得走了
Okay, I gotta go.

168
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,280
我爱你  亲爱的
I love you, sweetheart.

169
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,290
快点  你都在里面
Hurry up, you've been in there

170
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,460
呆了一个小时了
an hour!

171
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,210
等一下  小麻烦
One second, Maggot!

172
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,490
该死
Oh, fuck.

173
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,390
有人吗
Hello?

174
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,560
妈妈
Hey Mom.

175
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,700
我们到了你和爸爸最喜欢的地方了
We made it to you and Dad's favorite spot.

176
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,590
我想你
Miss you.

177
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,070
你还好吗
You okay?

178
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,370
我很好
\ I'm good.

179
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,590
帮我来做晚餐吗
Help me make dinner?

180
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,210
没问题  等我一会儿
Sure, in a second.

181
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,800
好的
Okay.

182
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,770
你是电影里的角色吗
Are you in a movie?

183
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,480
是
Un huh

184
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,410
你是女人吗
Are you a woman?

185
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,410
不是
No.

186
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,920
等等
Wait.

187
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,130
不是
No.

188
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,010
你是人类吗
Are you human?

189
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,260
不是
Nope.

190
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,980
你是机器人吗
Are you a robot?

191
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,650
是
Yes.

192
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,370
你最好的朋友是机器人吗
Is your best friend a robot?

193
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,540
也许是
Maybe.

194
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,300
你最好的朋友
Does your best friend

195
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,670
对你指手画脚吗
boss you around?

196
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,050
- 没错  - 老天爷
\ Yep. \ Oh my God.

197
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,300
直接说出来吧
Just say it already!

198
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,930
你是不是
Are you...

199
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,810
R2D2
R2\D2?

200
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,900
爸爸又赢了
Dad wins once again!

201
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,190
真吃惊
Shocker...

202
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,070
你之所以会这么刻薄
Ah, you're just bitter

203
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,330
是因为你来大姨妈了
'cause you're on your period.

204
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,660
行啦
All right.

205
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,540
天呐  真搞不明白
Oh God, I don't know

206
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,050
你和妈妈是怎么受得了待在这外面的
how you and Mom could stand it out here.

207
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,050
六月份就已经要冻死了
It's freezing and it's June.

208
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,020
这个嘛
Well...

209
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,900
我们有彼此
We had each other

210
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
互相依偎在一起
and we snuggled.

211
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,130
- 老爸  - 咋了
- hey,dad?  - hm?

212
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,840
我能闻一下你的啤酒吗
Can I smell your beer?

213
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,220
你能闻一下我的啤酒吗
Can you smell my beer?

214
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,410
别激动  我就是好奇它的味道
Don't get excited, I'm just curious.

215
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,590
闻着像克莱尔
It smells like Claire.

216
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,140
闭嘴吧  小麻烦
Shut up, Maggot.

217
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,670
嘿  茜茜
Hey Sissy?

218
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,170
怎么了  内森
Nathan?

219
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,800
你在写什么
What you writing?

220
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,680
也许是在给她愚蠢的男朋友写信
Probably a letter to her stupid boyfriend.

221
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,390
你生来就是为了
Were you put on this earth

222
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,690
逼我去自杀的吗
to make me wanna kill myself?

223
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,190
如果是这样的话  你会自杀吗
If I was, would you do it?

224
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,570
是不是过了你的睡觉时间了
Isn't it past your bedtime?

225
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,700
我才没有睡觉时间  是不是过了你的睡觉时间了
I don't have a bedtime. Isn't it past your bedtime?

226
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,660
不  你有的  我没有睡觉时间
Yeah, you do,No, 'cause I don't have one.

227
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,780
我没有睡觉时间
I don't have a bedtime.

228
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,790
不  你有的
Yes you do!

229
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,910
- 不  我没有  - 住手
- Yes-- no I don't!  - Don't!

230
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,000
我没有睡觉时间  你就承认吧
I don't have a bedtime, you admit it!

231
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,230
所以说  这个男生
So this boy.

232
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,480
他很特别吗
Is he special?

233
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,750
对我来说  他很特别
To me he is, yeah.

234
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,170
那你怎么不带来让我们见见
Then why haven't we met him?

235
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,090
因为我不想让他讨厌我
Because I want him to like me.

236
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,720
扎心啊
Ouch.

237
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,750
怎么了
What?

238
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,130
我的嘴唇很干  但是我没有带唇膏
My lips are dry and I don't have any chapstick.

239
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,760
你妈妈和她的那些口红
Your mom and her lipstick.

240
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,640
我不知道你还记不记得
I don't know if you remember.

241
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,610
你那时候还小
You were little.

242
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,860
但你经常和你妈妈坐在一起
But you used to sit with your mom,

243
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,620
你们俩坐在镜子前面
both of you plopped down in front of the mirror,

244
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,990
然后一起化妆
and you guys would put on your makeup together.

245
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,580
我记得
Yeah, I remember.

246
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,890
妈妈看起来好漂亮
Mom looked so beautiful.

247
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,010
而我
And...

248
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,780
看起来像个小丑
I looked like a clown.

249
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,280
可爱的小丑
Cute clown.

250
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,260
老妈是个大美人儿
Mom was gorgeous.

251
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,150
没错
Yes, she was.

252
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,590
克莱尔
Claire!

253
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,480
小丫头
Sissy.

254
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,190
走开
Get the fuck off me.

255
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,080
我不是故意让她死的  克莱尔
I didn't want to let her go, Claire.

256
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,960
你得明白这一点
You have to know that.

257
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,580
我不想讨论这件事
I don't wanna talk about this.

258
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,800
你怎么知道
How do you know

259
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,050
没有拯救她的办法了
that there's no way to save her?

260
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,740
- 你怎么知道的  - 那是我做过的
- how do you know that?  - It was the hardest decision

261
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,060
最艰难的决定
I've ever had to make

262
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,430
知道你们姐妹俩
knowing that you two girls--

263
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,690
我说了我不想
I said that I don't want

264
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,360
讨论这件事
to talk about this.

265
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,240
你不是上帝  内森
You're not God, Nathan!

266
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,620
你只是杀死她的凶手
You're just the one who's killing her!

267
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,580
克莱尔
Claire.

268
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,750
我们必须谈谈这件事
We have to talk about it.

269
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,630
她当时非常痛苦  亲爱的
She was in so much pain, honey.

270
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,960
这不是这次旅行的
That's not what this trip

271
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,010
目的
is about.

272
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,140
我只是想让你
I just want you to...

273
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,350
亲爱的  别进去
Sweetheart, don't go inside.

274
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,400
克莱尔
Hey Claire.

275
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,400
克莱尔
Claire!

276
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,190
我不知道该怎么办了  瓦尔
I don't know how to fix this, Val.

277
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,890
茜茜
Sissy?

278
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,520
你在做什么
What are you doing?

279
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,610
亲爱的
Honey?

280
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,120
你没事吧
Hey, you okay?

281
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,790
嘘  没事的
Hey, shh, it's okay.

282
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,910
来吧  躺下来
Come on, let's lie down.

283
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,390
你没事了  来吧
You're okay. Come on.

284
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,080
你怎么了  亲爱的
What is it, honey?

285
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,580
有人  有人在房顶上
There's somebody-- there's someone on the roof!

286
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,080
- 什么  - 我看见了一个人
- What?  - I saw someone.

287
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,210
我看见了一个人  就在

刚才在房
Just now on the...

289
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,220
什么
What?

290
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,560
- 宝贝  没有人能爬到那上面去的  - 什么
- Baby, nobody can get up there. - What--

291
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,120
老爸
Dad?

292
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,220
- 这是怎么回事  - 我不知道
\ What is that?  - I don't know.

293
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,930
过来坐到你姐姐旁边
Come over and sit down next to your sissy.

294
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,110
是谁
Hello?

295
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,000
我们有枪
We've got a gun in here.

296
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,510
请让我们进去
Please let us in.

297
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,880
谁在外面
Who's out there?

298
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,650
老爸
Dad?

299
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,860
没关系  亲爱的  没事的
It's okay, honey, all right?

300
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,500
天呐
Jesus.

301
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,810
请你把门打开好吗
Please will you open the door?

302
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,690
你有什么事
What's the problem?

303
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,190
我们想给你看个东西
We want to show you something.

304
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,290
他们真的好奇怪
They look really weird.

305
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,930
别开门
Don't.

306
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,390
万一他们真的需要帮助呢
What if they really need help?

307
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,560
闭嘴  玛姬
Shut up, Maggie!

308
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,280
别  别开门
Don't... don't open it.

309
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,450
我在加油站看见她了
I saw her at the gas station.

310
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,040
我觉得她是跟踪我们过来的
I think that she followed us.

311
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
那儿距这里有50英里
That was like 50 miles back!

312
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,710
听着
Listen, um...

313
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,340
我们不能让你进去
We can't let you in.

314
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,350
你知道的  现在太晚了
You know, it's late.

315
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,060
如果你们想打电话
If you guys need a phone,

316
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,610
最好到高速公路上
uh, you might want to make your way up to the highway.

317
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,320
我们迟早会让你们出来
We'll make you come out eventually.

318
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,870
那是绝对不可能的
That's not gonna happen.

319
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,230
三只瞎眼的老鼠
Three blind mice

320
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,650
三只瞎眼的老鼠
Three blind mice

321
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,040
看他们往哪儿跑
See how they run

322
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,420
我觉得他们走了
I think they're gone.

323
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,880
这可不一定
You don't know that.

324
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
只是几个孩子而已
It's just kids.

325
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,510
闭嘴  你个小
Shut up, you little--

326
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,890
- 喂  克莱尔  - 怎么了
\ Hey, Claire!  - What?

327
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,270
你非要把我们带到这里
You dragged us all the way out here,

328
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,400
现在我们困在荒郊野外
and now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere

329
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,980
谁知道外面有什么
with who knows what outside.

330
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
你知道吗
Just so you know,

331
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,910
没有人想参加这次旅行
nobody wanted to go on this trip.

332
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,870
克莱尔  这次旅行是为了妈妈
Claire, this trip was for Mom.

333
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,410
是的  但你知道吗
Right, well, guess what?

334
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,920
妈妈已经死了
Mom's dead.

335
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,050
玛姬  这下好了
Mags-- real nice.

336
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,760
嘿  玛姬
Hey Mags.

337
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,890
亲爱的
Honey.

338
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,010
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

339
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,180
我要去确定一下他们走了
I'm gonna go make sure they're gone.

340
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,300
- 不要去  - 你不如
- Don't go  - Why don't you go

341
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,270
过去向你妹妹道个歉
back there and apologize to your sister?

342
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,470
玛姬  你能出来吗
Maggie, can you come out?

343
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,350
玛姬
Maggie...

344
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,730
走开
Go away!

345
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,460
嘿
Hey!

346
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,710
玛姬  对不起
Maggie, I'm sorry.

347
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,260
玛姬
Maggie.

348
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,400
我觉得他们走了
Think they're gone.

349
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,260
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

350
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,510
好了  孩子们
All right, guys.

351
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,230
但愿我们把他们吓跑了
Hopefully we scared 'em off.

352
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,270
回床上继续睡觉吧
Let's go back to bed.

353
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,650
回去  不
There? No.

354
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,240
绝对不行
No way.

355
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,780
那你想睡这张床吗
Do you want to take the bunk?

356
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,040
那你呢
What about you?

357
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,370
我要继续守着你们
I am gonna keep watch.

358
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,170
以防那帮混蛋又来敲门
in case those punks come knocking again.

359
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,010
我们会把他们打得满地找牙
We'll give 'em a mouthful of teeth.

360
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,900
休息吧
Get some rest.

361
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,440
明天是个大日子  好吗
Tomorrow's a big day, okay?

362
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,580
好吧
All right.

363
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,100
嘿  克莱尔
Hey, Claire.

364
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,930
嘘
Shh.

365
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,860
起来吧
Come on.

366
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,830
没关系  来吧
It's okay, come on.

367
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,720
是那些孩子干的吗
The kids?

368
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,850
还能是谁
Who else?

369
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,650
- 他妈的  - 不许说脏话
- Fuck! - Watch your mouth.

370
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,910
好吧
All right.

371
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,530
这儿距离高速路只有几英里
Highway's just a few miles back.

372
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,620
只要我找到信号  我就打电话求救
Soon as I get reception I'll call for help

373
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,420
或者在马路上拦下别人
or I'll flag somebody down.

374
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,130
你要把我们留在这里
You're leaving us here?

375
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,220
玛姬没法走那么远
Mags can't make that hike.

376
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,550
不要把车的事告诉她
And don't tell her about the truck.

377
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,310
但愿在她醒来之前我就能回来了
Hopefully I'll be back before she wakes up.

378
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,810
嘿
Hey.

379
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,490
我需要你在这儿陪着你妹妹
I need you to stay here with your sister.

380
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,330
如果他们回来怎么办
What if they come back?

381
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,330
那就跑到拖车里面
You're gonna get in that trailer

382
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,880
把门锁上  在我回来之前  你们要
and you're gonna lock the door and you're gonna stay in there

383
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,590
一直待在里面
till I get back.

384
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,040
他们来敲门

385
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:21,180
咚咚  是谁在那

386
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:21,180
黑眼珠的孩子  在你巢穴

387
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,180
他们在夜晚潜伏  寻找不幸

388
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:36,320
像小偷一样窃取灵魂

389
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:36,320
但他们会预先发出警告  一旦被拒绝

390
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:36,320
他们便会将你诱出来  这便是他们的把戏

391
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,320
佚名

392
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,640
失踪人口

393
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,100
我受不了了

394
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,100
好了宝贝  我保证

395
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:53,270
嘿  妈妈
你过得怎么样  我们在路上不知道走了多长时间

396
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:59,020
爸爸做主 我快冻死了
我现在很迷茫

397
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:05,320
整段旅程都很压抑  真希望你在这
如果这次旅行能让你回到我身边哪怕只有一天
我也认了

398
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,290
我想你妈妈

399
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,620
救救我

400
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,180
我们能进去吗

401
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,840
好吗
Okay?

402
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,020
1  1  1  1  1
One, one, one, one, one.

403
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,190
给你
Okay.

404
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,320
好了  你们俩待在拖车里面
All right, you guys just stay in the trailer.

405
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,820
我会在早餐前回来的  好吗
I'll be back before breakfast, okay?

406
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,920
嘿
Uh, hey?

407
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,000
怎么了
What is it?

408
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,310
没什么
Um, it's, uh, nothing.

409
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,650
- 你确定吗  - 是的
\ You sure?  - Yeah.

410
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,190
好的
Okay.

411
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,290
你在干嘛呢
What are you doin'?

412
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,630
不关你的事
None of your business.

413
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,550
告诉你男朋友
Telling your boyfriend

414
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,930
没有他你活不下去吗
you can't live without him?

415
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,020
你有何贵干
What do you want?

416
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,440
老爸呢
Where's Dad?

417
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,190
他去远足了
Uh, he went for a hike.

418
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,650
他说他会在早餐前回来
He said he'll be back for breakfast.

419
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,200
可我现在饿了
Well, I'm hungry now.

420
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
他为什么不叫醒我
And why didn't he wake me up?

421
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,040
我会和他一起去的
I would have gone with him.

422
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,130
他说他要你待在这
\ He said that he wanted you to stay here,

423
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,430
他说了算
and he's the boss, so...

424
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,680
出什么事了你不告诉我
Something's going on you're not telling me.

425
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,520
我不是小孩了
I'm not a kid.

426
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,440
可你就是
Yes, you are...

427
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,700
小屁孩
a kid.

428
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,330
你要不用步话机联系一下他
Okay, do you want to try him on the walkie?

429
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,670
好
Yeah.

430
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,460
这样
Just...

431
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,680
爸爸  你能听到吗  完毕
Dad, do you read? Over.

432
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,550
我是玛姬
It's Maggie.

433
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,190
再说一遍完毕试试
Try saying "over" again.

434
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,110
我是玛姬  完毕
It's Maggie. Over.

435
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,840
他怎么不回答
Why isn't he answering?

436
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,190
你在吗  完毕
You there? Over.

437
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,990
一定是超出距离了
Uh, he must be out of range.

438
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,450
你怎么知道
You don't know that.

439
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,000
要是他迷路了怎么办
What if he got lost?

440
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,960
或者失足跌落了
Or fell?

441
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,630
或者被蛇咬了
Or got bit by a snake?

442
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,880
你知不知道响尾蛇能在一秒之内
Did you know rattlesnakes can strike up to three meters

443
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,890

不会有事的  好嘛

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,780
去把衣服换了
Just go and get dressed.

449
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,850
内森  你在吗

能让我玩玩嘛
Can I play?

454
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,980
这不是玩具
It's not a toy.

455
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,340
没有妈妈的娃娃
No figure of Mom, huh?

456
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,910
做得很不错
It's really nice.

457
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,290
你真这么觉得
You think so?

458
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,800
你一直都带在身边吗
Do you keep it with you all the time?

459
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,550
是  怎么了
Yeah, so?

460
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,770
我觉得这样很聪明
I think that's really smart.

461
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,570
这样妈妈就能一直守护你了
That way Mom can always look out for you.

462
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,350
想来帮我做条狗放在院子里吗
Want to help me make a dog house for the yard?

463
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,180
我们没养狗

有点梦想又不为过

465
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,240
好吧
Okay.

狗的脸做好了
Made the dog's face so far.

467
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,250
狗是蓝色的

468
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,090
- 没错  - 好的

然后我的一个娃娃就不见了

我只想找信号
I was just trying to go find signal.

557
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,100
对不起
I'm sorry.

558
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,320
没关系
It's okay.

559
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,330
听着  除非你和我一起否则你不能离开拖车
Listen, you cannot leave this trailer unless you're with me.

560
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,460
这对你们俩都一样
That goes for both of you.

561
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,190
我们现在该怎么办
What do we do now?

562
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,730
我们不能离开
We can't leave.

563
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,190
卡车打不着
Truck won't start.

564
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:06,120
我们今晚在这过夜
So, we'll stay here tonight.

565
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,830
明天一早
And then tomorrow morning,

566
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,260
我们所有人一起走到公路上
all of us will hike up to the road.

567
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,770
跟妈妈告别怎么办
What about saying goodbye to Mom?

568
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,240
她得等等了
She's gonna have to wait.

569
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,980
我今天出去的时候
When I went on the hike earlier today,

570
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,280
发现一辆拖车
I found a trailer

571
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,780
里面有一个男人的尸体
and there was a dead man inside of it.

572
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,410
他怎么了
What happened to him?

573
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,550
他自杀了
He, uh, he killed himself.

574
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,430
我觉得是那些孩子干的
But I think those kids made him do it.

575
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:03,690
好像是他们在外面守着等他出去
It's like they were daring him to go outside.

576
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,620
他们想要什么
What do they want?

577
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,300
我不知道
I don't know.

578
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,180
你为什么跑到垃圾场里去了
What made you go to the junkyard?

579
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,400
玛姬不见了  我在那里听到了她的声音
Maggie was missing and I heard her voice up there.

580
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,030
我找到了她的娃娃
I found her doll.

581
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:31,950
我不明白是怎么回事
I don't understand what's going on.

582
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,090
我想他们是想把我们引出去
I think they're trying to lure us out.

583
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:39,090
如果他们今晚来敲门
If they come knocking again tonight,

584
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,350
你们别离开拖车
you two do not leave this trailer.

585
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,730
不管发生什么
No matter what.

586
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,600
你在准备什么
What you workin' on?
