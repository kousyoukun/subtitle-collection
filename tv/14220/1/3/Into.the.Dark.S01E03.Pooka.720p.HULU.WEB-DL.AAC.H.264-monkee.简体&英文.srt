00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,620

你看起来口渴

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,530
可能会很危险
It can be dangerous.

52
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,710
其实
Well...

53

自己一个人住也很危险

我刚刚还在担心自己一个人过圣诞

我不是
I'm not.

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,220
那你来城里干什么
Oh, well, what brings you to town?

63
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,590
我也不知道
I'm not really sure.

64
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,550
我是来重新开始的吧
I'm...starting over, I guess.

65
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,350
白纸一张
Blank slate.

66
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,300
你有工作了吗
Are you employed?

67
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,520
算吧
Sort of.

68
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,080
算是吧
Sort of...

69
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,740
我猜  我是个演员
I'm an actor, I guess,

70
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,140
所以我猜我在演戏
so I--I guess I'm acting.

71
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,840
一位演员
Oh, an actor!

72
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,420

75
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,890
像醉汉一样晕眩

76
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,400
你也是吗
You too?

77
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,570
我也辉煌过
I had my moment.

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,580
可早就逝去了
It's long gone now.

79
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,250
我对你很有好感
I have a good feeling about you,

来自隔壁的威尔逊

81
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,840
现在是你的时代
This is your moment.

82
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,780
还没有逝去
It's not gone for you.

83
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,430
在我面前的
"Am I in the presence

84
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,510
是未来的圣诞节鬼灵吗
of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?"

85
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,040
你是我见过的最让人...
"I fear you more than any spec...?

86
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,750
让人恐惧的怪物
specter I have seen."

87
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,270
这么说很蠢
No, that's shit.

88
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,230
蠢极了
It's fucking shit. Okay, um...

{\an8}查尔斯·狄更斯《圣诞颂歌》

I fear you more than any specter I have seen.

93
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,110
但当我知道你并无恶意
But as I know your purpose is to do me good,

94
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,930
我准备好接受你的陪伴

并怀有一颗感恩之心

96
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,240
但在我走近
But before I draw nearer

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,080
你指的那块石头之前
to that stone to which you point,

98
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,800
回答我一个问题
answer me one question."

99
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,750
这将是未来的影子
"Are these the shadows of the things that will be

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,830
还是独一无二的影子
or are they the shadows of the things that may be only?

101
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,940
人们走的路将预示着他们的结局
Men's courses will foreshadow

102
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,310
如果坚持下去
certain ends to which, if persevered in,

103
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,230
他们必须主导
they must lead,

104
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,660
但如果路线偏离
but if the courses be departed from,

105
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,460
结局将被改变
the ends will change.

106
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,590
你所指示我的
Say it is thus

107
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,880
我也要这样说
with what you show me.

108
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,820
我是那个躺在床上的男人吗
Am I that man who lay upon the bed?

109
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,120
我是那个躺在床上的男人吗
Am I that man who lay upon the bed?

110
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,490
我是那个躺在...

119
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,090
好的  可以了  谢谢你
Okay, that's fine, thank you.

120
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,810

121
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,440
已经可以了
It's fine.

122
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,260
我做错什么了吗
Did I do something wrong?

123
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,100
我...
I'm...

124
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,190
我可以换一种形式
I can do it differently.

125
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,000
没这个必要了
That won't be necessary.

126
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,590
你...确定吗
Are you...sure?

127
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,410
把胳膊举起来

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,680
摆一个供奉的姿势
Out like an offering.

158
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,940
-摆一个飞机的姿势  -再快点
- Fly like a plane. - Faster!

159
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,690
把胳膊举起来
Raise your arms up.

160
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,830
摆成一个三角形
Together like a triangle.

161
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,640
摆一个供奉的姿势
Out like an offering.

162
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,900
摆一个飞机的姿势
- Fly like a plane. - Faster!

163
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,390
把胳膊举起来  摆成一个三角形
Raise your arms up, together like a triangle.

164
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,750
摆一个供奉的姿势  摆一个飞机的姿势
Out like an offering, fly like a plane.

165
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,160
好了好了  够了
All right, all right, all right, that's enough.

166
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,230
停停停
Stop, stop, stop.

167
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,730
就选他了
He's the guy.

168
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,190
让其他人回家
Send everyone else home.

169
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,360
就是他了
It's him.

170
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,690
天呐
Wow.

171
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,910
恭喜你
Ah, congratulations.

172
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,510
跟我来
Come with me.

173
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,860
这样...
So...

174
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,620
这是迷怪
This is Pooka.

175
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,420
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

176
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,730
它...
It's, um...

177
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,780
可爱
Cute?

178
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,100
拜托
Come on!

179
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,410
这个玩意儿不止是可爱  好吗
This motherfucker's more than cute, baby.

180
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,420
拜托
Come on!

181
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
这个玩意儿不止是可爱  好吗
This motherfucker's more than cute, baby!

182
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,140
对吧
Right?

183
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,310
太棒了
It's amazing.

184
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,140
这是主要的功能
It's a main feature.

185
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,720
它会重复你说过的话
He listens to what you say and repeats it.

186
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,450
但是有意思的在于
But here's the hook.

187
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,090
他是无法预料的
He's unpredictable.

188
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,110
迷怪选择录下并重复的话
You don't choose what Pooka's gonna record

189
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,030
不是由你选择  而是由它自己
and repeat, Pooka does.

190
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,660
他有调皮的设定和乖巧的设定
He's got a naughty setting and a nice setting,

191
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,770
但是你无法选择它的心情
but you don't choose what mood he's gonna be in.

192
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,950
迷怪才能选
Pooka does.

193
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,230
但是你无法选择它的心情
But you don't choose what mood he's gonna be in.

194
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,560
迷怪才能选
Pooka does.

195
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,480
我告诉你  测试下来
I'm telling you, this thing tested

196
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,950
这玩意完美翻了
through the roof.

197
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,410
它绝对能让圣诞节翻个天
This is gonna rip Christmas a new asshole.

198
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,640
我不明白这和我有什么关系
I don't understand what this has to do with me.

199
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,990
我是个演员
I'm an actor.

200
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,120
伙计  你的人生要彻底改变了
Buddy, your life is about to change forever.

201
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,420
伙计  你的人生要彻底改变了
Buddy, your life is about to change forever.

202
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
调皮的迷怪
Naughty Pooka.

203
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
这是不是很棒
Is this thing fucking amazing

204
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,220
还是说太他妈棒了
or is this thing fucking amazing?

205
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,590
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

206
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,510
看起来和那个玩具一样
Looks just like the toy.

207
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,450
不不不  说反了
No, no, no, no, other way around.

208
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,210
是那玩具看起来和这个一样
The toy looks like this.

209
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,560
是这个先来的
This came first.

210
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,870
你要我穿着这个吗
So you want me to wear this?

211
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,640
伙计  我要你成为它
Buddy, I want you to be him.

212
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,610
我觉得肯定是误会了
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

213
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,030
我是一名专业的演员
See, I am a professional actor.

214
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,890
所以你才会在这里
That's why you're here.

215
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,550
我们需要一个
We need somebody who can be

216
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,490
不仅仅只是穿着服装的家伙
more than just a guy in a suit.

217
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,860
我们需要一个
We need somebody

218
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,900
能赋予他生命的人
who can bring him to life.

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,020
没有你
Without you,

220
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,770
他什么都不是
he's nothing.

221
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,410
你都没有量我的身材
You didn't take my measurements.

222
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,560
你怎么知道穿着能合适
How did you know it'd fit?

223
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,670
当然能合适了
Of course it fits!

224
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,610
这属于你
It belongs to you.

225
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,330
感觉怎么样
How does it feel?

226
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,970
感觉
It feels...

227
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,400
还行
okay.

228
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,260
还行
Well, okay.

229
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,640
看来你们俩是天造地设啊
Seems like you two were made for each other.

230
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,320
转过来让我看看
Let's see you move around.

231
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,690
我怎么动
Uh, how do I move?

232
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,030
记得要你在试镜时做的动作吗
Remember the thing you did in your audition?

233
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,320
你试试
Try that.

234
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,120
把胳膊举起来
Raise your arms up.

235
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,730
摆成一个三角形
Together like a triangle.

236
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,840
供奉的姿势
Out like an offering.

237
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,790
摆一个飞机的姿势
And then you fly like a plane.

238
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,120
把胳膊举起来
You raise your arms up.

239
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,800
摆成一个三角形
Together like a triangle.

240
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,220
供奉的姿势
Out like an offering.

241
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,520
摆一个飞机的姿势
Fly like a plane.

242
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,730
把胳膊举起来
Raise your arms up.

243
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,730
摆成一个三角形
Together like a triangle.

244
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,460
供奉的姿势
Out like an offering.

245
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,220
摆一个飞机的姿势
And then you fly like a plane.

246
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,830
你没事吧
You okay?

247
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,740
怎么了  伙计
What's goin' on, man?

248
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,660
你没事吧
You okay?

249
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,460
怎么了
What's goin' on?

250
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,460
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

251
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,150
小心点  伙计
Watch it on that, man.

252
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,760
这玩意是要推销给孩子的
We're trying to market this thing to children.

253
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,690
这个太紧了吗
Is this too tight for you?

254
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,260
这算是什么测试
What the fuck kind of test was that?

255
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,360
-什么意思  -算了
- What do you mean? - Forget about it!

256
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,830
什么算了
Forget about what?

257
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,320
我没有感觉
I'm not feeling it, okay?

258
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,420
你在做出最终决定前
Do you want to talk about numbers

259
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,740
要不要先讨论一下酬劳
before you make your final decision?

260
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,170
我觉得你应该会对酬劳有感觉
I feel like you're gonna feel these numbers.

261
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,150
这有...
There's this, um...

262
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,030
匿名条款
There's this anonymity clause.

263
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,410
标准保密条款
Standard nondisclosure.

264
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,580
你不能说你是谁
You don't say who you are,

265
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,560
我们不会说你是谁
we don't say who you are.

266
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,880
这样能保护我们双方
Protects us both.

267
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,160
没人会知道是我
No one'll know it's me?

268
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,610
绝对不会
No, never.

269
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,520
这都是信任问题
It's about trust.

270
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,070
其他推销这些玩具的人
And, um, everyone else who promotes these toys,

271
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,040
都要签一份这个吗
they sign one of these?

272
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,640
什么意思
What do you mean?

273
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,640
其他演员
The other actors.

274
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,950
什么其他演员
What other actors?

275
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,540
我以为
I thought you said this was gonna be huge.

276
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,900
完美翻了
Tested through the roof.

277
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,070
就是圣诞大促销吧
It's a Santa' n' the all thing, right?

278
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,920
还有几个迷怪
How many other Pookas are there?

279
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,180
威尔逊
Wilson,

280
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
只有你  好吗
this is all you, okay?

281
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,620
一个迷怪  一个你
One Pooka, one you.

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
这是一个梦想
This is a dream.

283
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,720
太好了  太好了
Yes, yes!

284
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,740
公司绝对会爱上你  所以
Corporate is gonna love you, so...

285
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,690
休息去吧
get comfortable,

286
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,100
接下来就回去好好休息  给
take the rest of the day off. Here you go!

287
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,450
不不不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

288
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,980
不不不不
No, no, no, no.

289
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,750
什么都没有丢
And nothing's missing,

290
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
什么都没有吗
nothing at all?

291
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,760
是的
No.

292
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,570
你知道他们是怎么进来的吗
Do you have an idea how they got in?

293
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,250
门上着锁  窗户关着
The door was locked, the windows were closed.

294
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,360
我完全不知道
I have no idea.

295
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,720
我告诉你  亲爱的
I'm telling you, darling,

296
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,070
你应该报警
you should call the police.

297
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,450
没有东西被偷
Nothing was stolen.

298
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,590
很多破碎的东西是无法弥补的
A lot was broken that you can't un-break.

299
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,720
这楼里以前发生过这种事吗
Has this ever happened in this building before?

300
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,990
在我印象里
First time I can remember.

301
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,110
这是个安静的地方
It's a rather quiet place.

302
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,600
我明天去找个邻居
I'll borrow a vacuum tomorrow

303
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,520
借一个吸尘器
from one of the neighbors

304
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,250
处理掉被我们遗漏的玻璃碎渣
for any bits of glass that we've missed.

305
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,670
你在房间里就穿着鞋子吧
Meanwhile, you keep your shoes on inside.

306
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,050
放松点  亲爱的
Relax, love.

307
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,270
我知道有人闯入很可怕
I know, break-ins can be scary.

308
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,730
让你在自己的家里感到害怕
They make you feel scared in your own home,

309
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,080
但是没人会回来的
but no one is coming back.

310
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,360
结束了
It's over.

311
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,210

313
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,590
这样就算我不在
That way you won't feel alone,

314
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,290
你也不会感到孤单了
even when I'm not here.

315
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,140
好了  我要去工作了
All right, off to work.

316
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,770
你的新工作是什么
What is this new job?

317
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,410
你都没怎么和我提过
You've hardly told me anything about it.

318
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,720
是得穿着头套的
Uh, it's just this thing in a costume.

319
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,370
相信我  没什么意思的
Trust me, there's nothing interesting about it.

320
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,200
回头见了
I'll see you.

321
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,180
{\an8}迷怪

322
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,690
{\an8}调皮还是乖巧

323
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,970
{\an8}你永远不知道迷怪会怎么做

324
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,830
{\an8}警告  非常好玩

325
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,980
圣诞老人列了一张单子
He's making a list,

326
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:48,250
{\an8}迷怪  圣诞节的新宠

327
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,800
反复核查
he's checking it twice,

328
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,140
但就算他也分不出
but even Santa won't be able to tell

329
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,850
今年最火爆的玩具
if this year's new hottest toy

330
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,220
到底是调皮还是乖巧

331
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,310
认识一下迷怪
Meet Pooka,

332
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,780
一个有点调皮的

333
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,710
可爱迷人小熊
with a bit of a naughty side.

334
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,530
还是说应该是有点可爱的调皮小熊
Or is it the other way around?

335
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,390
{\an8}你说什么我就说什么
挠挠我的肚子
警告  非常好玩

The company won't say how the toy was conceived,

341
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,670
{\an8}贾斯汀下一个能见迷怪

342
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,840
或者其获利情况
or how many units have been made,

343
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,120
只表示他们期望

这不是我给你的哦
This didn't come from me.

我只是想来看看房子
I, uh, was just hoping to have a look at the house

381
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,710
如果你不忙的话

382
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,290
没问题  我能带你转一圈

383
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,260
你是第一个
You will be the first.

384
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,680
这幢房是1966年建成的
The house was built in '66.

385
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,580
中世纪中的翘楚
It's a mid-century gem.

386
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,750
现代  明亮
Modern, bright.

387
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,710
光线非常充足
Filled with tons of light.

四间卧室  四间浴室

389
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,760
如果你有需要的话还有很多公用空间
with plenty of communal space if you need it.

390
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,270
说到这个
Speaking of which,

391
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,330
这里是家庭活动室
this is the family room.

392
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,380
你在这市场里多久了
How long have you been in the market?

393
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,570
什么市场
The...the market?

394
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,400
房地产市场
Real estate market.

395
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,400
你找房子多久了
How long you've been looking.

396
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,220
对
Right.

397
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,960
我应该不算在市场里
Yeah, I'm not sure I am in the market.

398
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,960
我...我只是突然感兴趣
The...the listing just caught my eye,

399
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,840
而已
I think.

400
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,020
就是有时候突然看到一个地方
You know how you just see someplace and...

401
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,630
想想自己住在里面
you picture yourself living there.

402
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,070
我的确喜欢想象我自己
I do like to see myself

403
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,450
住在我推销的房子里
in all the places that I show.

404
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,160
就算是不好的房子吗
Even the bad ones?

405
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,180
没有不好的房子
There are no bad ones,

406
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,000
只有适不适合
only right or wrong fits.

407
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
这话说得好
That's very good, um,

408
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,660
说得非常专业
that's very...professional.

409
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,130
你很擅长
Was nicely done.

410
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,230
那么你是干什么的
So, what do you do?

411
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,820
我是一名演员
I'm an actor.

412
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,690
真棒
Oh, nice.

413
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,360
这里可是洛杉矶
Well, it's LA.

414
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,270
我其实只能算得上群演
I'm not much more than a walking cliche.

415
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,040
你看上去很眼熟
You look familiar.

416
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,730
你不用这么说的
Well, you don't have to say that.

417
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,200
不  真的
No, it's true!

418
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,400
你有演过什么我看过的角色吗
Uh, anything I would have seen you in?

419
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,280
有可能吗
Yeah. Maybe.

420
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,110
那你觉得这个厨房怎么样
So, what do you think of this kitchen?

421
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,910
全新的花岗岩和碎石装饰台面
Brand new granite and Caesarstone countertops,

422
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,170
全新的设备
new appliances,

423
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,060
还有这风景
and the view.

424
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,980
还不赖
Not too bad.

425
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,730
你好像已经在心里规划
You look like you're having a vision.

426
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,490
这房子能装修成什么样子
Seeing how this house could be.

427
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,110
对
Yeah.

428
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,430
那么
So, uh...

429
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,960
这里应该是客厅吧
I guess this is the living room.

430
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,880
对吧
Right?

431
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,450
我要在这个角落
Yeah, I'd put a big leather couch

432
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,080
放一张大皮沙发
in the corner over there.

433
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,390
艾墙上挂一张巨大的画
A...huge piece of art on the wall,

434
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,950
要...现代的
something...modern,

435
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,570
抽象的
abstract,

436
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,760
奇怪的
strange.

437
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,550
没错
Yeah.

438
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,100
住在这里
Someone could...

439
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,870
肯定能过上幸福的生活
could really make a nice life here.

440
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,360
一个人住会不会太空旷了
It is kind of big for one person, you know?

441
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,970
希望不会永远是一个人
Hopefully it won't always be just one.

442
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,600
你想出价吗
Do you want to make an offer?

443
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,960
也许吧
Maybe.

444
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,830
但是  听着
But listen,

445
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,480
我一般不会这么做
I don't normally do this.

446
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,530
我发誓  但是
I swear, but...

447
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,620
我能请你一起吃个晚餐吗
could I maybe ask you out for dinner?

448
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,930
有点过了
That's a little forward.

449
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,150
我知道
I know,

450
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,490
但是你不是经常能碰到
but it's not always that you meet someone

451
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,810
让你惊艳的人
that you think might be amazing.

452
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,820
认识你真的很高兴  威尔逊
It was really nice meeting you, Wilson.

453
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,800
我就不送你出去了
I'll let you see yourself out.

454
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,140
联系我
Call me sometime.

455
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,580
她真的好棒  雷德
Oh, she's amazing, Red.

456
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,210
你知道那种你遇见了一个人却觉得
You know that feeling when you meet someone

457
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,210
你早就和她相识的感觉吗
and it's like you've known them forever?

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,420
天啊  她很风趣
Oh, God, she's funny

459
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,020
她是那么...美
and she's so...beautiful,

460
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,050
我...我感觉好棒
and...and I just feel amazing.

461
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,040
我感觉一切都走上正轨
I feel like everything is working out.

462
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,390
我感觉我能做到我想做的人和事
I feel like I can do anything I want.

463
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,540
那是什么声音
What's that?

464
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,290
什么什么声音
What's what?

465
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,790
那种撞击的声音
That pounding noise.

466
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,790
我什么都听不到
I can't hear anything.

467
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,570
我想起来我把什么东西落在我的房间了
I just remembered I...I left something in my room.

468
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,010
我去拿一下  好吗
I'm gonna go and grab it, okay?

469
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,340
我马上回来
I'll be back in just a sec.

470
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,470
好的
Okay.

471
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,830
我
Uh, I, um,

472
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,020
我做饭烧伤了我的手
I burnt my hands, uh, cooking.

473
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,490
我得把手包起来
I've got to keep them covered for a while

474
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,880
才能痊愈
to allow them to heal.

475
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,700
真帅气
Handsome.

476
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,720
他会做饭
He cooks.

477
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,030
我真幸运
Lucky me.

478
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,830
我...我是在煮意大利面时
Well, I, uh...I burnt my hands

479
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,050
烧伤了自己的手
cooking a pot of spaghetti,

480
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,160
但是  我是说
but, I mean...

481
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,320
我喜欢你
I like the way

482
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,470
诠释的样子
that you're spinning it

483
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,460
听起来好多了
much, much better.

484
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,620
我还需要了解你的什么呢
What else should I know about you?

485
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,430
你在笑什么
What are you smiling about?

486
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,030
真是太好了
This has been nice.

487
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,490
认识你
Meeting you.

488
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,930
如此意外
Unexpected.

489
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,070
对吧
Right?

490
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,930
目前为止都很棒
So far so good.

491
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,850
我想亲吻你
I want to kiss you,

492
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,730
但是
but...

493
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,500
我觉得我需要许可
I think I might need permission.

494
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,360
许可了
Permission granted.

495
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,180
不是你的
Not from you.

496
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,490
那祝你好运了
Good luck with that.

497
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,580
这是今天的最后一个了
It's the last one today.

498
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,220
实在是太感激你了  伙
Really appreciate this, man.

499
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,090
谢谢
Thank you.

500
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,660
{\an8}给泰

501
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,140
你们家真温馨
Wow, this is, uh, this is a nice home.

502
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,510
谢谢你
Thank you.

503
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,770
过不了多久就乱了
It's temporary, though.

504
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,200
你的圣诞树呢
Where's your tree?

505
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,900
我们没有
We don't have one.

506
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,730
也许今年就不摆了
Maybe we'll skip it this year.

507
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,250
我以为我在哈尔彭的圣诞集市上看到你了呢
I thought I saw you at the Christmas lot on Halpern.

508
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,450
不  你看错了
No, not us.

509
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,120
这是给我的吗
Is this for me?

510
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,270
不  不
Uh, nah, um, no.

511
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,580
这是
This is, uh...

512
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,340
这是给守门人的
This is for the gatekeeper.

513
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,510
是吗
Ah, is that right?

514
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,450
泰
Ty?

515
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,640
过来一下
Come here for a sec.

516
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,340
泰  这是威尔逊
Ty, this is Wilson.

517
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,070
你好  先生
Hello, sir.

518
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
很有礼貌
That's...that's good manners.

519
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,670
我不干涉
I don't mess around.

520
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,000
你好  泰
Hello Ty.

521
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,690
我有东西要给你
I have somethin' for you,

522
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,930
如果你想要的话
if you want it.

523
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,770
我现在打开吗  还是
Can I open it now, or?

524
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,040
对
Uh, yeah.

525
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,500
它说
It says it, uh,

526
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,500
它现在就想被打开
it wants to be opened now.

527
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,530
我觉得你说得对
I think you're right, it does.

528
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,940
就这一次
Just this one.

529
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,030
我操  妈妈  是迷怪
Holy crap, Mom, it's a Pooka!

530
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,040
我操  妈妈  是迷怪
Holy crap, Mom, it's a Pooka!

531
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,020
不许说脏话  你们俩都是
Watch your mouth, both of you.

532
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,770
你该说什么
What do you say?

533
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,930
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir!

534
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,040
威尔逊
Wilson.

535
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,850
叫我威尔逊
Call me Wilson.

536
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,580
叫我威尔逊
Call me Wilson.

537
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,820
这种
Yeah, they, uh,

538
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,380
这种玩具会不按套路出牌
they can be a little unpredictable.

539
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,910
怎么了
What?

540
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,290
你很好  威尔逊
You're kind, Wilson.

541
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,210
他爸爸就绝对不会想到这种方面
Something his dad never would have thought of.

542
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,780
是吗
No?

543
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,500
他不是那种爸爸
Not that kind of dad.

544
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,190
那他是那种爸爸
What kind of dad was he?

545
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,320
就是我不想提及的那种爸爸
Not the kind I want to talk about.

546
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,180
我不想提及他
I don't want to talk about him.

547
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,830
我不想再让他毁了我的生活
I...don't want him to spoil my life anymore.

548
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,580
在这里等着
Wait here.

549
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,010
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

550
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,800
别担心
Don't worry.

551
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,020
我哪儿也不会去的
I'm not goin' anywhere.

552
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,550
今天干得不错
Good job today.

553
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,390
你也是
You too.

554
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,690
要去喝一杯吗
You want to get out of here, get a drink?

555
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,480
你...你去吧
Uh, you...you go ahead.

556
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,560
我...我就
I'll...I'm just gonna

557
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,010
在这儿待一会
hang out here for a bit.

558
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,610
好吧
Okay.

559
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,030
好吧
All right.

560
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,030
保重
Take care.

561
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,260
谢谢你
Thank you.

562
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,790
不仅仅是今天
Not just for today,

563
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,180
或者这工作  而是...
or the gig, but...

564
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,180
为这一切
for everything.

565
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,990
没事
Of course.

566
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,270
保重
Take care.

567
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,960
不  那...不
Oh...that the...no, no!

568
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,500
不
No!

569
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,020
不
No!

570
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,150
不
No!

571
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,200
不
No!

572
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,370
天啊  你...你怎么了
Dearie me, what-- what's wrong with you?

573
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,750
亲爱的  进来
Oh, love, come in.

574
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,090
进来
Come in.

575
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,210
我去烧水
I'll put the kettle on.

576
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,380
我妈妈经常说
There's nothing in the world

577
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,490
没有什么事是一壶好茶
that a good cuppa can't fix,

578
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,140
解决不了的
as my mum used to say.

579
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,680
不过这当然是个谎言了
Of course, that's a lie, though, isn't it?

580
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,560
有的谎言反而能帮助你度过一些难关  对吧
Some lies help you get through things, don't they?

581
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,230
毕竟她就是靠浓茶安稳度过了闪电战
Good, strong tea got her through the Blitz, after all.

582
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,450
我觉得我有点问题
I think there's something wrong with me.

583
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,210
我们都有问题  亲爱的
there's something wrong with all of us, love.

584
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,540
不  雷德  我...
No, Red, I'm...

585
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,250
我的记忆出现空白
I'm losing time, and...

586
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,670
我失控了
I'm losing control.

587
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,630
一切都没事
Things are all right...

588
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,800
对吧
right?

589
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,640
我有工作
I have this job,

590
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,060
遇见一个女孩
and this girl, and...

591
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,400
感觉
and it feels...

592
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,110
真的很棒
really good.

593
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,650
但是  这个东西  这...
But then, there's this-- this thing, this...

594
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,620
另一个东西...
this other thing, this...

595
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,290
这么危险
danger.

596
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,290
我觉得我记起为什么搬过来了
I feel like I remember why I moved here.

597
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,000
我是为了逃离
So I could get away.

598
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,590
逃离...痛苦
Away...from pain.

599
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,310
逃离给人造成痛苦
Away from causing pain.

600
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,900
每个人都有后悔的事  亲爱的威尔逊
Everyone has regrets, Wilson darling.

601
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,940
生活很艰难
Life is hard.

602
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,860
我们都会犯错
We make mistakes.

603
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,120
从现在起做出正确的决定
Make good choices now.

604
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,660
这是你的一切
That's all you have.

605
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,060
来啊
Come on!

606
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,610
来啊  来啊
Come on, come on!

607
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,170
太好了
Good, aw.

608
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,290
来啊  伙计们
Come on, guys!

609
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,700
迷怪  来啊
It's Pooka, come on!

610
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,030
来啊
Come on!

611
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,410
你今天玩的开心吗
So did you have fun today?

612
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,630
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're up to.

613
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,800
我想干什么
What am I up to?

614
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,980
你想讨好我
Trying to get on my good side

615
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,550
让我妈妈更喜欢你
so that my mom will like you more.

616
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,350
你不用给我买礼物或者给我们买圣诞树
You don't have to buy me things or get us a tree.

617
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,350
你只要陪着我们  对我们好
You just have to stick around and be nice.

618
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,730
我可以的
I can do that.

619
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,940
你不喜欢圣诞节吗
You don't like Christmas?

620
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,690
对我们来说很复杂
Tricky time for us.

621
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,860
也许我能让泰再爱上圣诞节
Maybe I can make Ty love Christmas again,

622
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,740
所以那周末我要给他办个小圣诞派对
so I'm throwing him a little Christmas party at the end of the week.

623
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,130
叫很多他的朋友
Get a lot of his friends together,

624
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,880
放音乐啊  交换礼物啊
play some music, exchange gifts.

625
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:35,950
你妈妈
So your mom,

626
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,220
她和我说了你们下周要办个圣诞派对
she told me about your Christmas party next week.

627
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,760
你高兴吗
Are you, uh, excited?

628
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,640
没错  肯定会和迷怪一起
Yeah. It's gonna be a Pooka thing.

629
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,710
多棒啊
How cool is that?

630
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,550
那你告诉我
Well, tell me this, now...

631
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,180
你想见见真正的迷怪吗
would you like to meet Pooka for real?

632
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,260
-靠  当然了  -我听到了
- Hell yes! - I heard that!

633
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,720
就是这棵了
This is it.

634
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,180
就这棵吗
That's it.

635
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,020
对  就是这棵了
Yeah, this is the one.

636
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,240
泰
Hey, Ty!

637
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,650
过来看看这棵
Come and have a look at this one.

638
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,080
不好意思  伙计
Excuse me, pal.

639
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,790
你能帮我们拍一张照吗
Do you mind taking our picture?

640
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,790
当然了  伙计
Yeah, of course, man.

641
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,710
谢谢
Thank you.

642
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,500
好的
Okay.

643
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,220
看看这璀璨的灯光
Look at all the pretty lights...

644
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,930
你会伤害我妈妈吗
Are you going to hurt my mom?

645
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,310
你会伤害我吗
Are you going to hurt me?

646
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,150
梅拉尼
Melanie?

647
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,370
{\an8}迷怪

648
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,940
你不用跟他保证的
You know, you didn't have to promise that.

649
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,840
他一整个早上都在和朋友们
He's been telling all his friends all morning

650
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,660
吹嘘那东西会来参加他的派对
that that thing is coming to his party.

651
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,410
我知道你是好意  但是
I know you meant well, but...

652
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,430
到时候如果没有来的话
he's going to be really embarrassed

653
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,620
他会感觉很丢脸
when it doesn't happen.

654
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,160
为什么会没有来呢
Why wouldn't it happen?

655
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,540
-拜托  -不  我和你说了
- Come on. - No, I told you.

656
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,040
我有关系
I have connections.

657
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,550
我和你说了  你为什么不相信我
I told you, why-- why wouldn't you trust me?

658
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,380
我相信你  只是
I trust you, it's just...

659
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,180
你确定吗
are you sure?

660
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,820
你不用为了我而承诺太多
You don't have to overpromise to impress me.

661
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,640
不  我知道
No, I know!

662
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:32,690
我不是想要给他空欢喜
I'm not trying to put things in his head.

663
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,150
好吗  绝对会来的
Okay? It's going to happen.

664
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,070
好的
Okay.

665
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,380
迷怪
Pooka!

666
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,700
妈妈  迷怪来了
Mom, Pooka's here!

667
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,700
你敢信吗  他在我家呢
Can you believe he's here at my house?

668
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,510
真是太棒了
Pretty awesome.

669
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,970
对吧
Right?

670
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,410
我觉得还行吧
Yeah, it's okay, I guess.

671
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,290
你...你跟他说过话吗
Have you--have you gotten to talk to him?

672
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,520
它是给小孩玩的  有什么大不了的
He's for little kids, what's the big deal?

673
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,990
你爸爸不在这里
Your dad isn't here.

674
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,160
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

675
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,330
就...谁都知道你爸爸的事
Just--everybody knows about your dad.

676
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,170
救...
Help...

677
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,390
我不知道
Yeah, I don't know.

678
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,520
我不是很能理解发生了什么
I really don't understand what happened.

679
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,400
不
No.

680
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,780
他也不说什么
He's not saying much either.

681
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,910
你没事吧  伙计
You okay, buddy?

682
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,960
很抱歉我今天没有来
I'm sorry I wasn't able to make it today.

683
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,370
没事
It's okay.

684
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,670
我习惯了
I'm used to it.

685
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,090
你能告诉我发生了什么吗
Can you tell me what happened?

686
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,130
威尔逊
Wilson.

687
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,180
我看到了他做的事
I saw what he did.

688
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:10,010
我知道他是谁
I'm pretty sure I know who he is.

689
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,610
我真的太害怕了
I was really scared.

690
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,530
他们吓坏了
They're livid.

691
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,370
我应该过来的
I should have been there.

692
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,620
-真希望你当时能在场  -我很抱歉
- I wish you had been. - I'm sorry...

693
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,580
变成了这样
that it went so wrong.

694
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,140
我们都希望泰能觉得那个派对很特别
We both wanted the party to be special for Ty.

695
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,380
那家伙是谁啊
Who was that guy?

696
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,920
-什么  -穿那身衣服的家伙
- What? - That guy in the costume?

697
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,320
我真是不明白怎么会让这种家伙
I just don't understand how someone like that

698
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,550
-跟小孩一起  -你是在怪我吗
- could be around kids. - Are you blaming me?

699
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,350
不  我只是不明白怎么会发生这种事
No, I just don't understand what happened.

700
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,310
仅此而已
That's all.

701
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,710
威尔逊  你看上去非常冷淡
Wilson, you just seem kind of passive,

702
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,540
当时真的很可怕
and it was really awful,

703
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,940
我只是不明白  好吗
and I just don't understand, all right?

704
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,170
孩子们很喜欢那个玩具
The kids love that toy.

705
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,970
我只是以为请那个玩偶来
I just thought that having the character there

706
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,240
和孩子们互动会非常特别
interacting with them, that it would be special.

707
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,750
-我明白  -我只想为泰做一些好事
- I get that. - I just wanted to do something nice for Ty.

708
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:20,100
我怎么知道会发生这种事
How was I supposed to know something like that would happen?

709
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,270
-我不是那个意思  -我只是想
- That's not what I meant. - I just wanted to do

710
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,550
为你和泰做一些好事
something nice for you and Ty!

711
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,130
我只想那样
That's all I want.

712
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,860
在哪里
Where is it?

713
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,280
什么在哪里
Where is what?

714
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:53,910
那棵树
The tree.

715
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,080
-什么树  -上帝啊  梅拉尼
- What tree? - Christ, Melanie!

716
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,430
如果你不喜欢那棵该死的树
If you didn't like the goddamned tree,

717
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,220
你可以直接告诉我
you could have just told me.

718
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,470
别这样跟我说话
Don't talk to me like that!

719
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,590
-你到底怎么回事  -我感觉
- What has gotten into you? - I feel like...

720
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,920
这是信任问题  我感觉
like it's about trust, I feel like

721
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,210
你不信任我
you don't trust me.

722
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,150
你没有告诉我真相
You don't tell me the truth.

723
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,180
-我没有告诉你什么的真相  -一切
- What don't I tell you the truth about? - Everything!

724
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,110
关于那棵树  泰的爸爸
About the tree, Ty's dad...

725
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,530
他和这一切有什么关系
What does he have to do with any of this?

726
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,810
他还在你们生活中吗[照片上]
Is he still in the picture?

727
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,660
他是泰的爸爸  他不在我们生活中
Well, he's Ty's dad, he's not in the picture

728
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,540
但他在照片上
but he's in the picture.

729
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,660
事情就是这样  没有那么简单
That's the way it works, it's not that simple.

730
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,780
没错  人人都知道泰的爸爸
Right, everybody knows about Ty's dad.

731
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,010
除我之外人人都知道他
Everybody knows about him but me!

732
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,990
请你马上离开这里
You need to leave now.

733
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,830
我
I'm...

734
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,250
别碰我
Don't touch me.

735
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,090
离开
Leave.

736
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,090
快点
Now.

737
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:17,150
{\an8}迷怪

738
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,410
{\an8}迷怪故障导致大范围回收

739
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,060
本季度最热的玩具
The hottest toy of the season

740
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,690
带来了最深的失望

741
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,310
洛杉矶各地
Countless malfunctioning Pookas

742
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,270
{\an8}没用

743
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,520
返厂了无数出故障的迷怪

744
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,640
{\an8}垃圾
去他妈的迷怪

745
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,610
父母们抱怨原先大热的

746
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,430
"调皮或乖巧"的玩具突然坏了
"Naughty or Nice" toys are suddenly broken,

747
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,020
{\an8}最大的失望

748
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,740
它们全都只会用奇怪的声音
all of them saying nothing but

749
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,240
重复一段原先录好的话
one bizarre prerecorded phrase.

750
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,980
看看这璀璨的灯光
Look at all the pretty lights,

751
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,150
看看这璀璨的灯光

752
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,370
先生  你觉得迷怪怎么样
Sir, how do you feel about Pooka?

753
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,940
简直就是一个废物
It was a total rip-off.

754
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,190
日日夜夜
All day, all night,

755
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,750
只会重复
it just kept saying the same thing

756
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,610
一样的话
over and over.

757
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,920
我退回了我的钱
Yeah, I-- I got my money back,

758
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,800
那我浪费的时间呢  这简直是胡扯
but where's my time? This is bullshit!

759
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,260
-没错  -这简直是胡扯
- Yeah! - This is bullshit!

760
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,710
我的时间呢
Where is my time?

761
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,240
我们要我们的钱
We want our money back!

762
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:50,500
{\an8}迷怪中心  停止营业

763
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:55,000
{\an8}迷怪中心  停止营业
直到有新的消息

764
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:13,690
伙计

765
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,280
谢谢你把这个带过来  非常感激
Thanks for bringing this by, appreciate it.

766
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,080
{\an8}迷怪
调皮还是乖巧

767
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,070
你看上去不大好  怎么了
You don't look so good, man, what's going on?

768
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:24,660
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

769
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,140
我觉得公司搞错了
Listen, I think corporate has got it wrong

770
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,460
我们得继续下去
and we just need to keep going.

771
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,920
你在说什么  伙计
What are you talking about, man?

772
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,350
都回收了  公关危机
There's been a recall, the PR's terrible.

773
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,920
已经回不去了
There's no coming back from that.

774
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,690
你不能让几个小小的意外毁了一切
You can't just let a few fucking incidents ruin everything!

775
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,620
那不仅仅只是几个小意外  威尔逊
It's more than a few incidents, Wilson.

776
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,300
那些玩具完蛋呢
The toys are busted.

777
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,510
已经没有人想买了
Nobody wants to buy them anymore.

778
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,160
事实上  还好你把这些带过来
In fact, I'm glad you brought this,

779
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,620
因为我可得拿回去了
'cause I gotta take it back.

780
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,640
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

781
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,310
怎么了  伙计
What's going on, man?

782
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:57,280
这不属于你
This doesn't belong to you.

783
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,200
已经完了
It's done!

784
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:03,490
伙计
Hey, man.

785
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,660
好好休息休息
Take some time for yourself.

786
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,080
出城玩玩什么的
Get out of town or something.

787
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,080
过好你的日子
Go live life.

788
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,380
找兄弟们喝几杯
Go have some beers with your bros.

789
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,010
我必须穿上这个
I need to be inside it.

790
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,550
你得控制你自己
You gotta get a grip.

791
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,930
接受一切的结束  伙计
It's okay for this to be over, man!

792
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,150
别来烦我  走开
Leave me alone, just go away!

793
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,970
小梅  拜托  我需要解释一下
Mel, please, I need to explain!

794
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,930

Mel?

797
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,060
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

798
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,480
你好  亲爱的

799
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,480
上帝啊  雷德

800
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,700
我很抱歉  亲爱的
I'm sorry, love.

801
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,280
你来晚了
You're too late.

802
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,040
你该离开了
It's time for you to go.

803

真正的道歉

我明白你为什么把我推开
I understand why you pushed me away

811
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,400
你为什么会害怕

812
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,700
但我想告诉你  从今以后一切都会不一样了
But I want you to know that things are gonna be different now.

813
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,740

我很担心你  而且

我准备好成为一个更好的人了

818
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,240

你什么毛病  伙计

那是我
That's me!

839
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:13,210
{\an8}去他妈的迷怪

840
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,040
上帝啊
Holy shit.

841
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:34,670
威尔逊
Wilson.

842
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,210
发生了什么
What happened?

843
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,460
你做了什么
What did you do?

844
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,220
他们拿走了  伙计

846
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,970

They took what?

847
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:44,470
我的头
My head!

848
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,720
上帝啊  做些什么
Jesus Christ, do something.

849
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,430
我感觉不到迷怪了
I can't feel Pooka.

850
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:49,850
威尔逊
Wilson?

851
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:51,230
伙计
Buddy?

852
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,350
根本就没有迷怪
There is no Pooka.

853
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,540
这是用来卖玩具的噱头
It's an invention to sell toys.

854
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,290
这套衣服里的是你
It's you in a costume.

855
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,690
只有你
It's just you.

856
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:03,490
一直以来都只有你
It's always been just you.

857
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,460

不
No!

859
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,800
住手
Stop!

860
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:24,220
不  不
No, no!

861
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,770
老实说  每年这种时候都经常会有这种事
We see it a lot this time of year, to be honest.

862
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,810
有没有...
Was there a...

863
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,230
打斗的痕迹
was there a struggle?

864
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,240
唯一的打斗是跟她的酒瓶
The only struggle was with the bottle

865
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,400
还有五层高楼
and five floors.

866
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,700
你们必须查出是谁干的
You need to find who did this to her.

867
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,250
我想我现在就看着她呢
Pretty sure I'm looking at that person right now.

868
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,210
不  你错了
No, you're wrong.

869
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,430
我知道你是谁
I know exactly who you are!

870
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:57,770
不
No...

871
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,310
不  不要动他们
no, not them!

872
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,070
不要动他们
Not them!

873
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,450
操
Oh, fuck!

874
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:37,690
喂
Hello?

875
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,620
泰  你没事吧
Ty, are you okay?

876
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,020
我们要去木场
We're going to the tree lot.

877
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,540
-我们需要一棵新的圣诞树  -泰  听我说
- We need to get a new tree. - Ty, Ty, listen to me.

878
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,710
有东西去找你们了
Something is coming for you, okay?

879
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,610
你们有危险  听我说
You're in danger, all right? Listen to me.

880
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,070
泰
Ty?

881
01:09:50,470 --> 01:10:01,100
{\an8}迷怪时间到

882
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:58,870
梅拉尼
Melanie?

883
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:07,630
泰
Ty?

884
