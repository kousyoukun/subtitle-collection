43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,440
我就要提醒你  你可以的
I am here to remind you that you are.

我希望你成为新的你  最好的你
I want you to become the new you, the best you,

58
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,840
你一直想成为
the you that you have always wanted to be

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,860
但不敢成为的你
but have been too afraid to become.

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,780
多一秒都不要耽搁了
Don't put it off for a second longer.

61
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,990
好了  你妈很快要回家了

-你就很漂亮很酷了  凯拉  -她是我的启迪
- You are, Kara. - She's my inspiration!

67

等我长大  我要像她一样
When I grow up, I wanna be just like her.

68
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,640

Actually, Kara, can you not jump on the couch?

69

我真的很怕你会伤到自己

那些饼干里不含糖
Those cookies didn't have sugar,

75
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,940
是含有枫糖浆  是原始饮食
they had maple syrup, they're paleo.

76
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,210
那是丹妮尔的食谱
They were Danielle's recipe.

77
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,610
凯拉  可以帮我收拾吗

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,180
但你们一起出演学校戏剧了
But you did school plays together.

88
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,330

That's true.

我本想去做演员的
I thought I was gonna be an actress,

92
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,650
我还赢过奖项

93
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,350
看来大家觉得我挺不错的
I guess people thought I was pretty good.

94
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,630
你为什么不再演戏了
Why'd you stop acting?

95
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,890
是因为你的疤吗
Is it because of your scar?

96
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,220
不是
No.

97
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,110
我就是决定去做
I just thought that I wanted to do something that would

我有种强烈的感觉  他们都一种
And I got the distinct vibe they were like,

113
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,970
"我们都可以上你"的意思
"We could both fuck you,"

114
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,690
我就想"还是算了吧"

看  所以我们不会买五千美元的靴子
You see? This is why we don't buy $5,000 boots.

146
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,880
天呐  拿着拿着
Oh, my gosh, here, take these, take these.

147
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,570
天呐
Oh, my fucking God.

148
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,280
外面下得好大
It's fucking pouring out there.

149
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,780
基拉的破车又坏了
Kaela's shitmobile broke down again.

150
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,620
你们怎么不打给我
Oh, you should have called me,

151
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,890
我会去接你们的
I would have come pick you up.

152
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,330
你能不能别侮辱莎狄
Um, can you not insult Sadie?

153
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,660
它可是陪伴我多年了
She's been with me for years.

154
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,770
好吧  随你  至少你还有车
Fine, whatever, at least you have a car.

155
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,650
天呐
Oh, my God.

156
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,480
这里看上去一点没变
Wow, it looks exactly the same here.

157
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,650
我好喜欢
I love it.

158
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,820
天呐  你父母居然要
God, I can't believe your parents

159
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,320
卖掉这里吗
are selling this place.

160
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,270
我们在这里度过了多少开心时光啊
We had so many good times here.

161
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,910
我不知道
I don't know, I just--

162
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,040
我一想到...还觉得心惊
it still freaks me out just thinking about...

163
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,070
好了  我要上谁才能
Anyway, who does a girl have to fuck around here

164
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,190
喝到杯酒啊
to get a drink, hm?

165
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
她今天都想要些怪怪的东西
Oh, she has odd wants today.

166
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,040
等等  我们不等丹妮尔了吗
Wait, shouldn't we wait for Danielle?

167
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,870
你真觉得她会来吗
You really think she's gonna come?

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,890
她不是说她会来的吗
Well, she said she would, didn't she?

169
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,950
你给她发短信时她怎么说的
What did she say when you texted her?

170
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,640
她说...
She said...

171
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,480
"那就太棒了
"That would be so amazing.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,620
好久没见过你们了
I haven't seen you girls in so long

173
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,700
而且也很想"  用的数字
and would be gr8," With an eight,

174
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,390
"跟房子道个别
"To say goodbye to the house.

175
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,220
把具体安排用电邮发给我
Just LMK the deets via email

176
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,780

178
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,310
她还有助理呢
Ooh, she has an assistant.

179
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,210
好了  我觉得她八成不会来
Anyway, I think she'll probably flake.

180
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,760
我觉得她会来的
I think she'll come.

181
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,940
真美味
Yes, yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.

182
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,760
你拿香槟酒了吗
Do you have the Champagne?

183
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,330
我还想要好多
I want so much more.

184
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,890
天呐  你们看到那张
Oh, my God, did you guys see

185
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,530
她和莱昂纳多的合照了吗

186
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,860
-谁  -迪卡普里奥
- Who? - DiCaprio.

187
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,650
莱昂纳多・迪卡普里奥  天呐  基拉
Leonardo DiCaprio, Jesus, Kaela.

188
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,960
抱歉  我肯定是没看到
Oh, sorry, I must have missed it.

189
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,840
抱歉什么
What are you sorry about?

190
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,810
错过了一张
That you missed a picture

191
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,970
丹妮尔和莱昂纳多・迪卡普里奥的合照吗
of Danielle and Leonardo DiCaprio?

192
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,780
-谁在乎啊  -天呐
- Who cares? - Oh, my God,

193
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,330
我好在乎的
I care so deeply.

194
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,550
她现在都能跟莱昂纳多谈笑风生了
She's just like hanging out with Leo now.

195
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,100
这多疯狂啊  多不可思议啊
You guys, it's insane, like, it's amazing.

196
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,690
另外
Mm, also,

197
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,620
你们看到她新节目的宣告了吗
did you see the announcement about her show?

198
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,570
春季播出
It's coming out in the spring.

199
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,530
嗯  等着瞧吧
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.

200
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,570
-气球  -嗯
- Oh, the balloons. - Yes.

201
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,770
不  我都没问你
Oh, no, I didn't even ask you

202
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,020
你的面试怎么样了
how your interview went.

203
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,150
没什么好说的
Oh, um, it-there's nothing much to tell.

204
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,600
-就是谈完了  -天呐
- It happened. - Oh, my God,

205
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,480
你要回学校了
you're going back to school.

206
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,390
或许吧  最终吧
Maybe, eventually, you know?

207
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,530
我很想完成学业
I'd love to finish my degree,

208
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,670
或许再回研究生院什么的
maybe go back to grad school or something.

209
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,710
那很好
That's great.

210
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,790
嗯  但这个是为了伊甸园酒吧的女招待工作
Yeah, but this was for a hostess job at Eden's Pub.

211
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,130
嗯
Yeah.

212
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,760
我那天好像看到了招工启事
I saw the help wanted sign there the other day.

213
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
我没想到你会想去那里工作
I just didn't think you'd want to work there.

214
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,410
我不想
I don't,

215
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,870
但我需要钱来偿还我的学生贷款
but I need to pay my student loans

216
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,540
我毕竟还去了两年
for the two years of college I did go to

217
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,520
然后精神崩溃
before I had a nervous breakdown

218
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,330
辍学了
and dropped out.

219
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,970
不是精神崩溃
It wasn't a nervous breakdown.

220
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,080
就是的
No, it was.

221
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,710
你们觉得丹妮尔一年能
You guys, how much money do you think

222
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,050
挣多少钱
Danielle makes in a year?

223
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,170
如果再算进她能获得的那些免费的东西
I mean, like, if you factor in all the free stuff she gets.

224
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,720
我读到她光是被动收入
I read somewhere she makes like $200,000

225
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,260
就有二十万
in passive income alone,

226
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,910
光是广告什么的
like just from ads and stuff.

227
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,110
肯定可多了
It's gotta be that much.

228
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,970
她家简直...
Her house is fucking--

229
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,490
就是我的梦想之家
it's literally my dream home.

230
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,970
简直像她钻进我脑子里
It's like she went into my brain

231
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,160
把我的梦想之家拿了出来
and plucked out my dream home

232
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,310
拿给了一个建筑师看
and showed it to an architect.

233
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,340
简直疯了
It's insane.

234
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,190
天呐  她肯定一年
God, she's gotta be making

235
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,180
能挣一百万了吧
like a million a year, right?

236
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,250
我真的不知道  克洛
I really don't know, Chlo.

237
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,770
真希望我有钱
I wish I had money.

238
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,560
有名
I was famous.

239
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,230
或者两者都有
Or both.

240
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,290
该死  她来了
Shit, she came.

241
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,680
-准备好了吗  -丹妮尔  你来了
- You ready? - Danielle, you made it!

242
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,460
-不会更好了  -我们都不确定你会来
- As I'll ever be. - ...we weren't sure I was gonna come.

243
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,590
等等  请进
Wait, come on in!

244
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,280
天呐  克洛
Oh, my God, Chlo!

245
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,870
你看上去好棒
You look amazing.

246
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,280
才不啦
Oh, no.

247
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,030
我觉得...算了
I feel like a...whatever.

248
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,140
-哪里  -好了  你看上去也好棒
- Oh, please! - Anyway, so do you, of course.

249
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,080
少来了
Stop.

250
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,990
各位  真抱歉我迟到了
You guys, I am so sorry I'm late,

251
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,900
好无礼
it is so rude.

252
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,370
莱克斯
Lex,

253
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,060
我好感激你今晚请了我来
I am so grateful you invited me tonight.

254
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,290
我本来特别怕被
I was really dreading whatever, like,

255
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,260
拉去洛杉矶的一个讨厌派对
awful party I was gonna be dragged to in LA,

256
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,200
结果...
and...

257
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,830
这样好多了
This is--this is so much better.

258
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,940
是啊  我们怎么可能
Yeah, well, we couldn't imagine

259
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,160
不带上你一起在这个房子里度过最后一个新年
spending the last New Year's in the house without you.

260
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,250
谢谢
Aw, thank you.

261
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,090
天呐
Oh, my God.

262
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,130
你们装饰得太棒了
You guys, this looks amazing.

263
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,320
气球好可爱
These balloons are so cute.

264
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,200
不是吧
Oh, come on,

265
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,440
我太喜欢这种数字气球了
I am obsessed with these number balloons.

266
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,420
是吧
Right?

267
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,530
基拉买的
Kaela bought them.

268
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,770
没什么的
Yeah, it was-- it's nothing,

269
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,870
就一元店淘的
they're like from the 99 cent store.

270
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,950
当然了
Of course.

271
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,150
你的品位一直最好了  基拉
You always have the best taste, Kaela.

272
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,800
记得我妈以前还问我
Do you remember my mom used to ask

273
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,380
我怎么不能穿得像你那么酷
why I didn't dress more funky like you?

274
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,120
是啊  她那么说挺怪的
Yeah, that was weird of her.

275
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,530
-是吧  -是啊
- Right? - Yeah.

276
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,190
我带了礼物来
Oh, I brought presents.

277
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,190

Cruelty free.

281

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,860
-我们在乎的  -全天然

艾斯特和塔米  好高档
Esther and Tammy, that's so fancy.

284
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,660
给我的好闺蜜什么都不嫌贵

-谢谢  -我觉得这颜色会特别火
- Thank you. - I think that color will go perfect.

286
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,590
这会特别轰动的
This is making a big splash.

287
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,460
还没发布呢  但会...
Not out yet, but like bright--

288
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,140
是一抹亮色
brightens-- brightens everything up.

289
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,520
好啊  谢谢
Cool, thanks.

290
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,480
嗯
Yeah.

291
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,080
不客气
Of course.

292
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,540
天呐  各位
Oh, my God, you guys,

293
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,480
我可以记录下一切吗
can I document this?

294
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,220
你们在意吗
Do you care?

295
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,360
没问题
Sure, yeah.

296
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,330
天呐  我包里都放了什么啊
Jesus, what do I have in here?

297
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,220
简直像辆小丑车
It's like a freaking clown car.

298
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,100
我要往外掏
I'm just gonna be pulling out

299
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,110
兔子和鸭子了
like rabbits and ducks.

300
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,950
好了  大家凑过来
Okay, everybody scrunch in.

301
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,120
莱克斯  来
Lex, come on.

302
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,600
我在中间
I'll be in the middle.

303
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,920
凑过来
Gather 'round.

304
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,690
好了
All right.

305
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,800
挤过来
Scrunch in.

306
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,250
准备好了吗
Ready?

307
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,640
该死  我眨眼了
Oh, shoot, I'm blinking.

308
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,410
再来一张吧
One more, okay?

309
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,970
好
Okay.

310
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,230
大家说"茄子"
Everybody say "Cheese."

311
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,110
健康起来  丹妮尔
Get Well Danielle.

312
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,550
健康起来  丹妮尔
Get Well Danielle!

313
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,450
我就是想说
Well, I'm just saying that I just feel like

314
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,600
有女人参与的事
just because a woman is involved in something

315
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,420
未必就女权了
doesn't make it inherently feminist,

316
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,890
我觉得我们需要注意这个
and I think that's something we have to watch out for,

317
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,160
你得警醒
like you've gotta be aware

318
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,300
钱和社会机器
that money and this whole machine

319
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,600
会让一切变质
co-opts everything, right?

320
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,620
-好吧  -你们每次希望我闭嘴
- Okay. - You guys always just say okay

321
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,650
都会说"好吧"
when you want me to shut up.

322
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,810
不  我赞同你  基拉
No, I'm with you, Kaela.

323
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,110
我太醉了  不能聊这个
I'm too drunk for this conversation.

324
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,380
基拉
Oh, Kaela,

325
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,540
可以别放多脂奶油吗
do you mind leaving out the heavy cream?

326
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,550
我DF
I'm DF.

327
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,800
什么
DF?

328
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,880
不吃乳制品
Dairy-free.

329
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,220
等等  你有意不吃乳制品吗
Wait, you're dairy-free by choice?

330
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,220
是啊  这对你没什么好处的
Yeah, it's really bad for you.

331
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,920
我才不管呢
I do not care.

332
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,930
我是永远不可能放弃奶酪的
There's no way I could give up cheese.

333
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,550
相信我  我知道
Ugh, trust me, I know,

334
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,880
我好想念奶酪的
I miss cheese so freaking much.

335
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,370
你不吃乳制品多久了
So like how long have you been DF?

336
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,930
四年了吧
Like four years now?

337
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,510
我的一个粉丝发私信说
Yeah, one of my subscribers sent me a message

338
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,360
她脑袋上长了很痛的疖子
saying she had these like terrible painful boils on her head.

339
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,190
疖子
Boils?

340
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,420
是啊  她试了各种药
Yeah, and she tried all of these different medicines

341
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,160
-都不好使  -恶心死了
- and nothing worked. - Oh, that's so gross.

342
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,930
可吓人了
It was really fucked up.

343
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,500
她求着我帮忙
And she was like begging me for help.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,040
但她知道你不是医生吧
But she knew you weren't a doctor though, right?

345
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,350
那无所谓的
Yeah, it didn't matter.

346
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,620
她找过医生了
She had tried doctors

347
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,100
但什么都不好使
and nothing was working.

348
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,710
我就研究了一下
So I did some research

349
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,700
发现乳制品能引起发炎
and found that dairy can cause inflammation issues.

350
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,100
我还读到了其他
And then I started reading about all this other, like,

351
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,170
乳制品对身体的可怕影响  我就想
horrible stuff dairy does to your body and was like,

352
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,110
"我真不该吃乳制品的"
"Whoa, I should not be eating dairy."

353
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,660
听上去你真的产生了积极影响
Wow, it sounds like you're really making a difference.

354
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,430
是啊  这很有满足感
Yeah, I mean, it's totally rewarding,

355
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,350
但是
but, um...

356
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,930
也很辛苦的
it's also a lot of hard work

357
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,530
压力很大
and a ton of pressure.

358
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,270
有时候我会希望
You know, sometimes I just wish

359
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,420
我还跟你们在这里
I was back here with you guys,

360
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,600
像以前那样傻乐呵
just goofing off like we used to.

361
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,130
相信我  你不想的
Believe me, you don't.

362
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,950
相信我  我想的
Believe me, I do.

363
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,530
月亮总是别人家的圆嘛
Well, I think the grass is always greener, you know?

364
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,520
是啊  你说得对
No, you're right, you're right.

365
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,350
我该对我所拥有的感到感激
I should be grateful for what I have.

366
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,900
我是对我所拥有的感到感激
I mean, I am grateful for what I have,

367
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,360
但是
it's just, you know,

368
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,640
有时候你很容易适应了新的平衡
it's sometimes so easy to get accustomed to a new equilibrium

369
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,380
而忘记了自己多么幸运
and forget how lucky you are.

370
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,060
人性吧
Human nature, I guess.

371
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,410
该死
Ah, fuck.

372
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,460
该死  你没事吧
Shit, are you okay?

373
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,240
该死
Ah, fuck.

374
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,230
来
Here.

375
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,440
我没事的
Hey, I'll be fine, I just...

376
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,240
真没事吗
Are you sure?

377
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,980
阿莱克西斯  你真会做饭
Alexis, you are such a good cook.

378
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,330
这些看上去好棒
This all looks so amazing.

379
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,020
嗯  谢谢  莱克斯
Yeah, thank you, Lex.

380
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,900
好香啊
Smells incredible.

381
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,620
谢谢
Thank you.

382
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,560
美味
Yummy.

383
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,470
等等  我们开始前
Wait, um, before we start,

384
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,640
你们能迁就我一下吗
would you guys humor me with something?

385
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,280
当然
Yeah, sure.

386
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,300
我知道这挺俗的
Okay, I know this is a little corny,

387
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,000
但毕竟我们要跨年了
but it is the end of the year, after all,

388
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,820
我觉得如果我们能围坐在桌边
and I think it would be really productive

389
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,040
夸夸自己这一年来
if we just like went around the table

390
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,890
最骄傲的成就
and celebrated ourselves

391
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,570
会很有好处
by acknowledging our proudest accomplishments of the year.

392
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,290
是啊  挺傻的
I know, it's silly,

393
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,380
就是提醒一下自己  我们有怎样的能力嘛
it's just, you know, to remind ourselves of what we're capable of.

394
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,730
好啊  挺好的
Yeah, sure, that's nice.

395
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,880
-好吗  -好
- Yeah? - Okay.

396
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,430
-你先来吧  -我先来
- You go first. - I'll go first.

397
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,510
我志愿  我先来
I volunteered, so I'll go first.

398
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
你请
All you.

399
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,270
好吧
Okay, um,

400
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,110
我想我今年最骄傲的成就
I guess my proudest accomplishment this year

401
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,680
就是我接纳了一个情况特别艰难的孩子
would be that I had a really challenging kid come in,

402
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,740
她耳聋  还自闭
um, she was deaf and autistic,

403
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,300
她有...
and, you know, she has like--

404
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,810
很多感官问题
she had a lot of sensory issues.

405
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,360
然后...
And, um,

406
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,660
我不想说得太多愁善感
I don't want to get too mumbo-jumbo-y,

407
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,440
但真的
but it was just-- it was really--

408
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,110
感觉很棒
it's really cool to just--

409
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,140
看到一个人在这么短的时间
to watch a person develop so much

410
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,380
成长这么多
over such a short period of time.

411
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,610
所以
So...

412
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,170
基拉  真是太棒了
Kaela, that is incredible.

413
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,180
你绝对完爆我们所有人
You definitely put the rest of us to shame.

414
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,560
-不  -是的
- No. - Oh yeah.

415
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,070
你真是位出色的女人
You are a fucking amazing woman.

416
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,150
好吧  谢谢
Okay, well, thank you,

417
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,470
我觉得不是  但随便吧
I don't think so, but, you know, whatever.

418
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,710
-换别人换别人  -我觉得你就是
- Someone else, someone else. - Well, I think you are.

419
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,190
克洛
Chlo?

420
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,710
-随你怎么想吧  -好吧
- Whatever you want. - All right, well, okay,

421
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,120
尽管我妈生病了
even though my mom's sick

422
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,100
我没有工作
and I don't have a job

423
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,270
我还破产了
and I'm broke

424
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,460
而且我网上约会了两百次
and I've been on over 200 internet dates

425
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,960
但还是单身
and I still don't have a boyfriend,

426
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,570
我今天没有自杀
I didn't fucking kill myself this year,

427
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,490
敬这个  对吧
so cheers to that, huh?

428
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,570
我开玩笑呢
I'm kidding.

429
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,560
老天  丹妮尔  这是个玩笑
Oh, my God, Danielle, I'm joking.

430
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,560
好吧  放开所有玩笑
Okay, well, all jokes aside, um...

431
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,480
你看起来很受伤  克洛
it seems like you're actually really hurting, Chlo,

432
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,080
我想让你知道
and I want you to know

433
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,280
如果你需要我  我就在这
that I'm here for you if you ever need me.

434
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,650
谢谢
Thank you.

435
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,270
-我爱你  -我爱你
- I love you. - I love you.

436
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,410
莱克斯
Lex?

437
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,170
好吧  克洛和基拉知道
Um, well, as Chloe and Kaela know,

438
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,820
今年其实
this year was actually

439
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,610
对我来说很艰难
especially challenging for me.

440
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,750
天哪
Fuck.

441
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,190
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

442
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,060
你想跟大家分享一下吗
Is it--is it something you want to share or...?

443
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,980
就是有很多后悔的事
Just a lot of, you know, um... regrets?

444
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,810
感觉我没有活出最好的自己
Feeling like I didn't live my best life.

445
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,650
浪费了很多时间
I wasted a lot of time.

446
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,770
我不知道  只是
I don't know, I--I just had

447
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,920
我有很多愿望和梦想和幻想
all these um, hopes and dreams and visions,

448
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,010
但我只是
but I just, um...

449
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,230
嗯
Yeah, so,

450
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,190
其实没完成什么事情
I didn't actually accomplish a lot this year.

451
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,740
其实好多年都这样了
Actually, for a lot of years.

452
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,800
我觉得自己在过去停滞不前
I feel like I've kind of been bogged down by the past.

453
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,260
紧紧抓着那些
Holding onto things that really I--

454
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,370
我本该放手的东西
I should have let go of.

455
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,640
所以
So...

456
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,280
总之
Anyway, um,

457
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,730
我知道今年快要结束了
I know it's almost the end of the year,

458
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,920
但我真的觉得我最大的成就
but I really feel like my biggest accomplishments

459
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,310
还没有到来
have yet to come.

460
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,870
莱克斯
Wow, Lex.

461
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,070
我喜欢这态度
I loved that.

462
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,500
没错  总归还是时间
Yes, there is always more time,

463
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,320
干杯
so cheers.

464
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,430
干杯
Cheers.

465
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,950
敬我们自己
Cheers to us!

466
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,600
等等  你那时在哪
Ha, wait, where were you?

467
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,570
我在看《等待古夫曼》
I was watching Waiting for Guffman.

468
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,370
什么
What?

469
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,650
对啊  我都不知道发生了什么
Yeah, I had no idea that was going on.

470
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,910
你有没有  他射在裤子了
Did you--he jizzed in his pants?

471
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,450
是啊  太疯狂了
Yeah, dude, it was crazy.

472
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,500
他就  他要来亲我
He like--he went in to kiss me

473
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,010
他喊了一声
and then he was like ugh,

474
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,340
然后往后退
and he backed up.

475
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,210
我就问他  "发生什么了"
And I was like, "What's happening?"

476
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,520
然后他不想让我靠近他的裤裆
And like he just didn't want me anywhere near his crotch.

477
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,350
然后我意识到他射在裤子里了
And then I realized it was because he had jizzed in his pants.

478
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,880
我真不敢相信你从没告诉过我
I can't believe you never told me that.

479
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,280
你们知道吗
Did you guys know that?

480
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,530
知道
Yeah.

481
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,640
青春期的男孩真变态
Teenage boys are so weird.

482
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,380
真恶心
So gross.

483
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,060
莱克斯  你还记得
Lex, do you remember the night

484
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,780
你和诺亚・斯皮瓦克亲热的那晚
that you were making out with Noah Spivak

485
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,370
我从地板上爬过去
and I like crawled across the floor

486
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,650
把灯的开关拔了吗
and unplugged the light?

487
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,980
当然记得
Yes, I do.

488
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,850
等等  那是不是他说"小穴"的那晚
Wait, was the same night he said "VJ"?

489
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,080
-是的  -我的天
- Yes. - Oh, my God,

490
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,480
如果你让我摸你的小穴
I'd bet you'd feel really good

491
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,220
我相信你肯定会感觉很好
if you let me touch your VJ.

492
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,550
谁说的
Who says thats--

493
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,630
真恶心
It's so gross.

494
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,890
等等  阴道是这么拼的吗
Wait, is vagina spelled with a J?

495
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,600
难道我一辈子都拼错了
Have I been spelling it wrong my whole life?

496
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,840
-不是  -我觉得
- No. - I feel like...

497
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,110
等等  他后来摸你了吗
Wait, so--so, did he touch your VJ?

498
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,640
那晚没有
Um, not that night.

499
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,610
我觉得我来大姨妈了
I think I had my period.

500
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,770
然后还有个女孩
Also there was a girl

501
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,750
在地板上爬着
crawling around on the floor

502
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,190
想拔了开关
unplugging lights.

503
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,540
不客气
You're welcome,

504
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,810
我是在营造气氛
I was trying to set the mood.

505
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,150
-我那时很爱诺亚  -我的天
- I loved Noah. - Oh, my God,

506
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,690
你简直是为他着迷
you were so obsessed with him.

507
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,240
他很可爱
He was very cute.

508
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,040
很可爱
He was cute.

509
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,380
好了  该谁了
Okay, whose turn is it?

510
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,080
等等  你呢  基拉
Wait, okay, what about you, Kaela?

511
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,040
我感觉自己完全不知道你的感情生活
I feel like I know nothing about your love life.

512
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,280
她正热恋着呢
Oh, she's hot and heavy with someone.

513
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,770
他叫什么名字
What's his name?

514
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,200
不是男人
Not a man.

515
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,010
其实是她
It's a woman, actually.

516
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,160
她叫弗兰基
Her name's Frankie.

517
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,170
我的天  太棒了
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

518
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,690
我都不知道你喜欢女孩
I didn't know you were into girls.

519
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,250
是啊  我喜欢姑娘
Yeah, yeah, I am.

520
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,940
我是说
Um...I mean,

521
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,620
高中时候我就喜欢姑娘
I--I was in high school too,

522
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,660
但太害怕不敢出柜
I was just too scared to come out.

523
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,280
抱歉
I'm sorry.

524
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,300
你们怎么认识的
How'd you guys meet?

525
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,030
工作
At work.

526
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,670
她在儿科工作
She works in the pediatric department,

527
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,200
所以
so, yeah,

528
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,810
我们已经在一起一年了
it's been almost a year now.

529
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,440
其实我还没告诉你们
Oh, actually, I didn't even tell you guys this.

530
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,780
等她租期到了我们打算同居
We are gonna move in together when her lease is up.

531
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,550
-天哪  太好了  -恭喜啊
- Oh, shit, that's awesome. - Congratulations.

532
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,010
天哪  太棒了
Oh my God, that's amazing!

533
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,160
我们之前在讨论新年
We were just talking about like the new year

534
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,450
新计划什么的
and like goals and stuff,

535
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,670
然后就觉得应该
and it makes sense.

536
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,880
等等  先别说
Wait, save it.

537
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,410
我有个好主意
I have a really good idea.

538
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,660
大家好  我是丹妮尔
Hey, guys, it's Danielle.

539
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,090
我正和我高中最好的朋友在一起
I'm here with my high school besties

540
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,940
我们在分享各自的新年计划
and we were just talking about New Year's resolutions.

541
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,190
这是基拉
This is Kaela.

542
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,720
你的新年计划是什么
Okay, what are your resolutions?

543
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,620
好的  你知道吗
Okay, you know what,

544
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,780
我想多去户外走走
I would like to spend more time outside,

545
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,920
少盯着手机
less time on my phone.

546
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,020
我感觉自己一辈子都盯着屏幕
I feel like I spend like my entire life staring at a screen.

547
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,710
而且你知道吗  我真的很想
And you know what, I really want to be better

548
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,260
更好地帮助别人
about helping people, you know,

549
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,140
现在世界上
with all the stuff that's going on

550
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,950
发生了这么多事  我就感觉

我们得重新录
We need to start over.

553
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,440
我不想搞得有政治倾向
We try not to get like too political,

554
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,180
这样会让人们觉得无聊
'cause it tends to bum people out

555
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,840
或疏远那些与我政治倾向不同的人
or can alienate anyone that doesn't have my same politics.

556
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,490
你就说说感情生活吧
Um, maybe just like stick to your love life.

Get that fucking camera out of my face, Danielle.

606
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,620

607
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,810
什么鬼  阿莱克西斯
What the hell, Alexis?

608
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,810
我只是
I was...

609
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,790
我只是不想让你落单
I was just trying to include you.

610
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,870
我去检查下保险丝
I'll go check the fuse box.

611
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,200
哎呀
Yikes.

612
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,050
我以为窗户会碎
I...thought the window was gonna shatter

613
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,580
手机也会坏
and my phone was gonna be totally screwed.

614
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,940
我还在颤抖
I'm still shaking.

615
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,360
是啊  自从那次事故后
Yeah, um, Alexis's parents

616
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,720
阿莱克西斯的父母把这里
had the whole place like hermetically sealed

617
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,610
封得严严实实的
after the accident and...or whatever.

618
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,170
操
Fuck...

619
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,010
抱歉  我不想吓你一跳
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

620
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,540
我只想下来和你说
I just wanted to come down here and say I'm...

621
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,820
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry, I...

622
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,630
我都不知道事故后你是第一次回来
I had no idea you hadn't been back since the accident.

623
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,930
对你来说肯定很难
That must be really hard for you.

624
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,000
听着
And, look,

625
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,160
我知道咱俩很久没见了
I know I haven't seen you in a while,

626
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,100
我不知道
and, I don't know,

627
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,690
也许感觉有点怪
maybe things feel weird

628
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,410
因为你都是从我的视频上了解的我
because you only get this idea of me from my videos,

629
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,370
但我还是我
but it's just me.

630
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,600
说真的  莱克斯
Like, seriously, Lex,

631
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,700
是我啊
it's me.

632
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,030
跟你一起去美容院做除毛手术
The same girl who you went to electrolysis with

633
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,630
除去下巴毛的那个女孩
to get her chin hair zapped off.

634
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,160
每周五晚上都和你
Same girl who you'd go into food comas with

635
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,650
暴饮暴食的那个女孩  只因为没人愿意和我们玩
every Friday night because no one wanted to hang out with us.

636
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,010
天哪
Oh, my...

637
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,270
你还记得吗
Do you remember that?

638
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,710
-记得  -我们管那叫什么
- Yeah. - What did we call it?

639
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,660
我的天
Oh, my gosh, uh,

640
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,970
厨师快车

641
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,830
我一直都在想你
I think about you all the time.

642
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,910
你是我最好的朋友
And you're my best friend.

643
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,210
你认识我的时间比其他人都久
You've known me longer than anyone,

644
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,430
你看见过我身上其他人没见过的地方
you've seen parts of me no one else has,

645
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,950
真的
like, literally,

646
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,320
你检查过我有没有痔疮
you checked my butt for hemorrhoids.

647
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,260
而且我不想
And there's no one else

648
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,430
和其他人一起过新年
who I'd rather ring the new year in with.

649
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,310
我很感激你请我过来
I'm so grateful you invited me back here.

650
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,160
而且你是一个
And you're just

651
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,070
出色坚强的女人
such an amazing, strong woman,

652
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,230
我非常敬佩你
and I admire you so much.

653
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,980
我为你感到骄傲

-快说  -我从来没有
- Come on. - Never have I ever...

683

685
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,040
等等  什么是"轮流性爱"
Wait, what the hell is "Taking turns"?

686
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,580
就是三人行
It's a threesome where it's like

687
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,610
克洛伊称之为棕榈泉三人行
what Chloe calls her Palm Springs Threesome.

688
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,510
-什么  -没错
- What? - Yeah.

689
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,320
也不算是三人行
Yeah, no, it's not exactly a threesome,

690
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,720
更像是
it's more like, um,

691
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,350
轮流做爱
well, taking turns.

692
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,170
就好比睡了一个人
Like sleeping with one guy

693
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,080
之后再睡另一个
and then another?

694
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,710
没错  就是这样
Exactly, yeah.

695
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,410
不仅仅是啪啪啪
It's not just fucking,

696
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,290
他们还轮流给我下面口
like they take turns going down on me.

697
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,760
-天哪  -不  挺好的
- Oh, my God! - Yeah, no, it's fine,

698
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,640
如果你问我  我觉得很有礼貌
it's very polite, if you ask me.

699
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,330
好吧  你在轮流之前你认识这些人吗
Okay, did you know these guys before you took turns?

700
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,460
-差不多认识吧  -我的天哪
- Sort of. - Oh, come on!

701
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,610
克洛伊  你得说完整的故事
Chloe, you have to tell the full story.

702
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,080
好了好了  我们称这个家伙叫点头男
Okay, okay, so we call this guy The Nodder.

703
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,070
-点头男  -快说快说
- The Nodder? - Tell her, tell her.

704
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,680
好吧  我和一些朋友出去开生日派对
Okay, so I was on a birthday trip with some friends,

705
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,150
然后我们租了个房子
and we rented this house.

706
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,300
然后我和其中一个小伙子搞上了
And I had started hooking up with this one guy.

707
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,330
他是一个朋友的朋友
He was like a friend of a friend.

708
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,070
-没错  -然后有个男人进屋了
- Right. - But then this other guy came into the room,

709
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,460
我们一直在亲热
and we were like getting going,

710
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,200
他就站在门口看着
and he kind of just stood in the door.

711
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,330
你懂的  盯着看
You know, just watching.

712
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,700
然后他慢慢地靠近
And then he kind of came a little closer.

713
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,320
最后坐在了床边
And then he sat on the edge of the bed,

714
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,620
然后我看了他一眼
and then I kind of looked at him

715
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,250
之后他朝我点了点头
and he nodded at me.

716
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,950
我朝他点了点头
And I nodded back at him.

717
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,420
然后我又朝床上的男人点了点头
And then I nodded at the guy I was in bed with.

718
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,230
然后他朝我点了点头
And then he nodded back at me.

719
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,210
然后一切就顺其自然地发生了
And then it sort of just happened.

720
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,080
是不是很疯狂
Isn't that crazy?

721
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,820
我还是不知道
I still don't understand

722
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,440
大家怎么都知道点头意味着做爱
how everyone knew that a nod means sex.

723
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,990
那还能是什么意思
What the fuck else is it supposed to mean?

724
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,440
-打招呼吗  -谢谢
- Hello? - Thank you!

725
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,110
但当你裸着时  就很明显啊
But when you're naked, it's pretty obvious.

726
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,800
这就像是一个暗号表示
I mean, it's kind of like code for like...

727
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,220
-让我加入  -没错  让我加入
- Let me get in there. - Yeah, let me get in there.

728
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,900
-是不是很疯狂  -每次听都觉得精彩
- Isn't that wild? - Never gets old.

729
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,870
总之
Anyway, okay, um...

730
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,700
我从来没有
Never have I ever...

731
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,250
初中毕业舞会时尿裤子
Peed my pants at junior prom.

732
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,760
-都没有人注意到  -就是你
- No one even noticed that! - You!

733
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,120
所以不算
So it didn't count.

734
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,270
说真的  幸亏有你们
Actually, thanks to you guys.

735
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,540
-没错  不客气  -你们还记得雅奈尔老师吗
- Yeah, right, you're welcome. - No, Mr. Yarnelle, you remember?

736
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,590
我的天
Oh, my God.

737
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,720
水洒在地上了
There has been a spill.

738
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,730
各位我重复一遍
Everyone, I repeat,

739
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,960
潘趣酒碗旁水洒在地上了
there has been a spill by the punch bowl.

740
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,130
他真是太奇怪了
He was so fucking weird.

741
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,600
-我觉得他很可怜  -为什么
- I feel bad for him. - Why?

742
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,550
因为他看起来很孤独
Because he seemed like a lonely guy.

743
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,660
好吧  我从来没有
Okay, never have I ever

744
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,980
忘记刷牙
forgotten to brush my teeth.

745
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,010
什么
What?

746
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,120
真无聊
So boring.

747
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,120
随便了  好吧
Whatever, okay.

748
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,930
大家都该喝酒
Everyone should be drinking,

749
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,330
你们肯定都忘记刷牙过
you've all forgotten to brush your teeth.

750
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,350
-我知道  -我没有
- Yeah, I know. - I haven't.

751
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,660
但我知道如果不说些限制级话题
But I knew you wouldn't drink at all

752
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,580
你们都不会喝酒
if we didn't do some PG ones.

753
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,330
-没错  -我也做过坏事
- That's true. - I've done stuff.

754
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,850
-比如  -还没轮到我
- Like what? - Well, it's not my turn,

755
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,660
所以我没必要说
so I don't have to say,

756
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,290
但我能告诉你我做过坏事
but I'm just saying I've done stuff.

757
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,580
-读书和织毛衣  -随便吧
- Reading and knitting. - Whatever.

758
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,490
我有个好问题
I have a really good one.

759
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,500
我从来没有
Never have I ever

760
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,530
跟名人上过床
hooked up with a celebrity.

761
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,320
谁
Who?

762
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,340

00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,710
谁
Who?

765
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,110
丹妮尔  快告诉我
Danielle, fucking tell us.

766
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,730
我签了保密协议
I signed an NDA.

767
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,830
我不能
I literally,

768
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,300
法律不允许我告诉你们
legally cannot tell you who.

769
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,420
开什么国际玩笑
Are you fucking kidding me?

770
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,140
是我们啊  我们还能告诉谁
It's us, who the fuck are we gonna tell?

771
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,610
我们只认识彼此
We only know each other.

772
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,880
快告诉我  求你了求你了
Fucking tell me, please, please.

773
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,680
给我个提示  小小的提示  拜托
Just a hint, a little one, please.

774
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,320
-拜托  -好好好
- Please. - Okay, okay, okay, okay.

775
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,020
-一个小小的提示  -好
- A tiny hint. - Okay.

776
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,570
电动
Electric...

777
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:13,330
汽汽车车
caaarrrss.

778
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,670
电动汽车
Electric cars.

779
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,540
我的天
Holy shit.

780
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,930
他差不多是全世界
He is like the richest man

781
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,260
最富裕的男人
in the entire world.

782
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,810
-真的吗  -是啊
- He is? - Yes!

783
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,750
你们怎么认识的
How did you meet him?

784
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,840
他给我打电话
He called me.

785
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,150
等等  什么
Wait, what?

786
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,810
我知道  很疯狂
I know, it was crazy.

787
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,260
我坐在马桶上
Um, I was sitting on the toilet

788
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,840
剪着脚趾甲
clipping my toenails,

789
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,350
然后接到一个电话
and I got this call.

790
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,940
他助手给你打的吗
Like from an assistant?

791
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,750
不  直接找我
No, directly.

792
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,030
什么  他直接打电话给你的吗
What, he just called you on the phone?

793
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,340
是的  我想
Yeah, I guess, um,

794
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,080
应该是我的经纪人给他我的号码
he got my number from my manager and...

795
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,700
等等  好吧
Okay, wait, okay,

796
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,300
他直接给你打了电话
so he just called you on the phone

797
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,300
问你要不要一起来一炮吗
and asked you if you wanted to hook up or?

798
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,230
不  他没有问我要不要来一炮
No, he didn't ask me if I wanted to hook up.

799
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,520
他45岁左右
He's like 45.

800
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,850
他约我出去
He asked me out.

801
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,210
上帝啊
Thank God.

802
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,670
他怎么知道你的
How did he even find out about you?

803
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,780
和大家一样
Same way everyone else does.

804
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,430
少来了
Get the fuck out of here.

805
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,220
他看你的视频吗
He watches your videos?

806
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,120
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

807
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,440
怎么
What?

808
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,040
他看上去那么...睿智
He just seems so...smart.

809
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,390
对啊
I know, right,

810
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,930
他不是第一个
I mean, he's not the first person

811
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,470
我没想到是我粉丝的人
who I would think is a fan,

812
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,290
但是他应该和一个我经常帮忙调配果汁的演员
but this actor who I, like, give juices to

813
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,360
是朋友
is a mutual friend,

814
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,280
我想应该是他给他看了我的视频
and I guess he showed him my videos.

815
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,900
等等  所以你的演员朋友
Wait, okay, so the actor friend,

816
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,230
是莱奥吗
is that Leo?

817
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,380
是莱昂纳多  对吗
It's Leonardo, isn't it?

818
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,530
是莱昂  你和莱昂睡了吗
It's Leo, did you sleep with Leo?

819
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,550
-你走火入魔了  -丹妮尔
- You're obsessed. - Danielle,

820
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,330
你和莱昂睡了吗  -没有  算了
- did you sleep with Leo? - No! Okay, you know what,

821
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,410
我们还是继续玩游戏吧
let's just get back to the game.

822
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,960
别跟我说你和他也签了什么该死的
Don't tell me you have some fucking bullshit NDA

823
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,510
-保密协议  -我没有和莱昂睡
- with him too. - I did not sleep with Leo.

824
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,250
但你的确是他的朋友  对吗
Okay, but you're friends with him, right?

825
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,150
-关系很铁  -是的  差不多吧
- Like you're tight? - Yeah, I mean kind of.

826
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,270
他很喜欢我的果汁
He likes my juices.

827
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,280
我想也是
I bet he does.

828
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,870
你好恶心
Ew, that is so gross.

829
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,720
太疯狂了
This is insane!

830
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,880
那他带你去了哪里
Okay, so where did he take you?

831
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,370
我刚告诉你们我从来没有和他一起出去约会
I just told you I never went out with him.

832
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,660
不  她说的是电动汽车先生
No, she's talking about Mr. Electric Car.

833
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,120
其实不算是真正的约会
Well, it wasn't exactly like a date.

834
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,920
这简直跟拔牙一样痛苦  丹妮尔
Okay, this is like pulling teeth, Danielle.

835
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,370
上帝啊  你最好赶紧说
Jesus Christ, you better dish.

836
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,070
我要杀了你
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

837
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,590
没什么好说的
There's not much to tell.

838
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,750
很短  而且
It was brief and...

839
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,510
我不知道
I don't--I don't know,

840
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,190
有点奇怪
kinda weird.

841
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,400
怎么奇怪
How was it weird?

842
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,050
伙计们  我真的
Okay, you guys, I'm like really

843
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,170
不应该说这些事
not supposed to talk about this.

844
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,890
拜托  伙计们
Yeah, come on, guys,

845
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,090
如果她不想说
if she doesn't want to talk about it,

846
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:26,710
她就不用说
she doesn't have to talk about it.

847
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,190
拜托
Oh, come on.

848
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,920
如果她说她不能说  那她就是不能说
If she says she can't talk about it, she can't talk about it.

849
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,560
基拉  拜托
Kaela, give me a break.

850
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,890
她都不肯老实说她
She can't just like drop that she's fucking

851
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,130
上了硅谷的王
the king of Silicon Valley,

852
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,890
还想让我们就这么
and expect us to be like,

853
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,030
"好吧  那我们就不提了"
"Oh, okay, we'll just drop it."

854
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,790
她可以  伙计们  因为
She can because, guys, we're playing a game.

855
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,770
我们继续回到游戏上
Let's just get back to the game.

856
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,020
-我继续来  -好吧
- I'll take my turn again. - All right.

857
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,960
好吧  我从来没有...
Okay, so, never have I ever...

858
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,170
不  这游戏就是这样  基拉
No, this is the game, Kaela.

859
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,110
我们得谈谈
We're supposed to talk about

860
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,550
我们的经历
the experiences that come up.

861
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,110
这才是重点
It's the whole fucking point.

862
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,140
是丹妮尔不遵守规则
Danielle's the one who's not playing it.

863
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,360
你不理解保密协议的概念吗
Do you not understand the concept of an NDA?

864
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,580
看来我们档次太低
I guess we're just too provincial

865
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,200
理解不了这么高端的概念
to understand such sophisticated concepts.

866
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,370
好吧  我们休息一下
Okay, let's take a break.

867
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,070
我们就
Let's all just--

868
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,370
不  这真是胡扯
No, it's fucking bullshit.

869
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,950
我以为我们都是你最好的朋友
I thought we were your best friends.

870
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,190
你以为我们会告诉谁
I mean, who do you think we're gonna tell?

871
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,440
反正没人会在乎你和
Nobody gives a shit what you did

872
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,970
电子汽车先生干了什么
with Mr. Electric Car anyway.

873
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,870
差点就信了
Well, you could have fooled me.

874
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,560
好好玩这个游戏
Just play the fucking game.

875
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,970
我们度过了一个漫长的周末
We spent a long weekend together.

876
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,670
是吗
Yeah?

877
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,550
然后呢
And what?

878
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,490
他开加长汽车来接你
He picked you up in a limo?

879
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,170
他的确派车来接我
He sent a car for me, yeah.

880
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,660
然后呢
And?

881
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,810
然后呢
Then what?

882
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,910
然后他带我上了他的私人飞机
Then he took me on his private plane.

883
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,860
然后我们飞到了他在希腊的小岛
And then we flew to his island in Greece

884
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,740
在那里共度了一个周末
and spent the weekend.

885
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,070
就是这样
That's it.

886
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,080
那我来理一理
So, let me get this straight,

887
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,330
一辆加长汽车开来接你
a limo picked you up

888
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,880
送你上了飞机
and took you to a plane.

889
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,050
飞机里是一个你完全不认识的人
Inside that plane was a perfect stranger

890
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,320
带你去了他的私人岛屿  上了你
who took you to his private island, fucked you,

891
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,120
然后你就再也没有他的消息
and then you never heard from him again.

892
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,250
莱克斯  够了
Lex, I think that's enough.

893
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,970
是这样吗  丹妮尔
Does that sound about right, Danielle?

894
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,980
我们继续吧
Let's move on.

895
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,150
那你基本上就是一个妓女
So you're a whore, basically.

896
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,670
轮到我了
My turn.

897
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,900
我从来没有
Never have I ever

898
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,600
欺负过一个温柔无辜的小女孩
bullied a perfectly sweet and innocent girl

899
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,390
导致她自杀
until she committed suicide.

900
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,030
喝吧  丹妮尔
Drink, Danielle.

901
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,820
给我喝
Fucking drink.

给我喝

903
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,340
承认你自己做的事  丹妮尔
Admit what you did, Danielle.

904
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,920
承认你折磨凯尔西
Admit you tortured Kelsey

905
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,710
导致她从窗户跳了出去
until she jumped out of a window.

906
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,500
那并不是什么该死的意外
It wasn't a fucking accident.

907
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,700
承认吧  你这个该死的贱人
Admit it, you fucking bitch.

908
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,680
十  九  八  七

911
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,810
新年他妈的快乐
Happy fucking New Year.

912
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,850
住手
Stop!

913
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,710
快点  把她绑起来
Now, quick, tie her up!

914
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,140
去拿气球  把她绑起来
Get the balloons, tie her up!

915
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,920
基拉  你在干什么
Kaela, what are you doing?

916
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,300
你同意这么做的
You agreed to do this.

917
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:31,990
救命
Help!

918
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,830
去拿椅子
Get the chair.

919
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,240
-喝  -给我喝
- Drink! - Fucking drink.

920
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,990
-天啊  -该死的凯尔西
- Oh my God, - Fucking Kelsey.

921
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,170
你们干什么
What the fuck are you guys doing?

922
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,450
好了  我开始拍了
Okay, I'm rolling.

923
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,980
不  还不行
No! Not yet.

924
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,280
怎么回事
What is going on, you guys,

925
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,700
你们在干什么
what are you doing?

926
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,430
时钟过了12点
Clock struck 12.

927
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,930
我要采纳《健康起来  丹妮尔》的建议
I'm taking Get Well Danielle's advice.

928
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,360
新的一年  新的我
It's a new year and this is the new me.

929
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,430
该把真相公之于众了
It's time to tell everybody the truth.

930
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,350
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

931
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,880
当我们发现
When we found out

932
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,150
你要上电视了
that you were gonna be on TV,

933
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,840
我们就知道我们要阻止你
we knew we had to stop you.

934
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,100
我们不会让你站在
We're not gonna let you stand

935
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,410
几百万人面前
in front of millions of people

936
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,710
假装自己是完美的小公主
and pretend to be this perfect little princess

937
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,070
健康骗子女王
Queen of Wellness psychotic phony.

938
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,960
全世界都应该知道真相
The whole world deserves to know the truth.

939
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,010
我会告诉他们
And I'm gonna tell them.

940
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,040
我会告诉全世界
I'm gonna tell the whole fucking world.

941
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,150
我要毁掉你的人生
I'm gonna ruin your life.

942
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:45,110
你那完美的小人生都是基于谎言的
Your whole perfect little life is based on a lie.

943
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,490
你是个骗子  你是个烂人
You're a fraud, you're a terrible person.

944
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,600
你很邪恶  你霸凌所有人
You're evil, you bullied everyone.

945
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,730
你一直说克洛伊胖
You called Chloe fat all the time.

946
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,200
她患了两年的暴食症
She was bulimic for two years.

947
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,420
你说基拉
You called Kaela...

948
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,100
是个丑陋的女同性恋
an ugly lesbian.

949
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,460
她受到深深的伤害  到了二十多岁
She was so traumatized she didn't come out

950
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,100
才敢出柜
till her mid-fucking-20s.

951
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,450
-基拉  -闭嘴
- Kaela-- - Shut up!

952
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:13,510
凯尔西只是想要成为我们的朋友
All Kelsey wanted was to be our friend,

953
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,700
而你折磨她
but instead you tortured her.

954
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,700
你杀了她
You killed her.

955
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,790
然后你继续你的生活
And then you just moved on.

956
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,970
我知道那晚很痛苦
I know that night was traumatic.

957
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,700
我们俩都在场
We were both there.

958
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,340
我们俩都想成为她的朋友
We were both trying to be her friend.

959
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,950
不  我们没打算成为凯尔西的朋友
No, we weren't trying to be Kelsey's friend!

960
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,210
我们折磨她
We tortured her!

961
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,930
你告诉我们那样对她
You told me that fucking with her

962
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,200
是为了她好
was for her own good,

963
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,160
她是个又胖又丑的废物
that she was a fat, ugly loser

964
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,210
需要我们帮助她变好
who needed our help to become cool.

965
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,310
我从来没有这么说
Guys, I never said that.

966
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,850
我听了你的话
And I fucking listened to you.

967
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,740
我相信你
I believed you

968
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,110
因为你的权力凌驾于我
because you had power over me.

969
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,880
就像你统领着这一大群
Just like you've got power over this army

970
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,310
自恋的混蛋
of narcissistic little fucking brats

971
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:52,710
占领全世界
who are taking over the world,

972
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,990
传播并迷恋你的一派胡言
spreading and liking your bullshit

973
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,570
跟传染病似的
like it's a fuckin' disease.

974
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,850
你不配告诉人们要自爱
You do not deserve to tell people to love themselves

975
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,070
你这一辈子明明
when you've spent your entire life

976
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,900
都在让别人受尽折磨
making people feel like shit!

977
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,240
但以后再也不会了
But not anymore.

978
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,030
该告诉全世界
It's time to tell the world

979
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,910
你是一个多么恶劣的人
what a terrible person you are.

980
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,000
我觉得那...
I think that's, um...

981
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,190
我觉得那是个好主意
I think that's a good idea.

982
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,350
大家好
Hey guys.

983
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,860
我是丹妮尔
It's Danielle.

984
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,870
我在和我的朋友们一起
I'm just here with my friends

985
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,150
我们在聊一些非常深层次的事
and we were talking about some pretty deep stuff.

986
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,100
这个话题我在工作上
Stuff that actually speaks to an issue

987
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,020
也遇到过好多次
I keep coming back to in a lot of my work

988
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,890
我觉得我们都有这种困扰
that, um, I think all of us struggle with.

989
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,670
过去的罪孽
The sins of the past.

990
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,460
当我们执迷于
When we hold onto bad things

991
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,440
我们过去所做的坏事  那能...
we've done in the past, it can--

992
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,260
能对我们的身体
it can have all sorts of...

993
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,710
产生各种有害的影响
deleterious effects on our body.

994
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,570
痤疮
Acne,

995
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,640
肥胖
weight gain,

996
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,560
失眠
insomnia.

997
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,720
为了避免这些
So in order to avoid

998
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,040
可怕的生理反应
these terrible physical ailments,

999
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,420
我们需要放下我们的罪孽
we need to move through our sins.

1000
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,990
我们需要忏悔
We need to confess.

1001
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,030
我16岁时  我的一个朋友死了
When I was 16 a friend of mine died.

1002
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,370
她叫凯尔西  她...
Her name is Kelsey, and she was...

1003
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,370
是一名优秀的女孩儿
an amazing young person

1004
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,560
拥有着光明的前景
with so much life ahead of her.

1005
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,920
但是她的同学们却对她进行无情的嘲笑
But her classmates teased her mercilessly.

1006
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,410
他们会叫她丑女
They would call her an ugly bitch,

1007
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,100
废物
a loser.

1008
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,100
她每天都会哭着从学校回家
She would come home from school every day crying.

1009
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,040
当我想到
When I think about a...

1010
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,790
一个可怜有无辜的女孩
poor innocent girl

1011
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,320
遭遇这种事
going through something like that,

1012
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,360
我就...
it just...

1013
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,240
天啊  我就觉得恶心
gosh, it just makes me sick.

1014
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,280
但我也有参与
But I was complicit.

1015
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,830
我的罪
My sin...

1016
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,220
我的罪
My sin...

1017
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,950
是我根本没有去阻止他们
Is that I didn't do anything to stop them.

1018
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,370
天啊
God.

1019
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,690
天啊  这样说出来的感觉真是太好了
God, that feels good to get that off my chest.

1020
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,300
那根本不是忏悔
That wasn't a fucking confession.

1021
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,460
谢谢你给我的机会
Thank you for that opportunity.

1022
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,420
天啊
God.

1023
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,250
你对着镜头有点紧张吗
You feeling a little camera shy?

1024
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,070
得用镜头对你进行特写吗
Gotta get camera ready before your close-up?

1025
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,430
你喜欢吗
You like that?

1026
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,830
别担心  这是无动物产品
Don't worry, it's all cruelty free.

1027
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,500
阿莱克西斯  冷静点
Alexis, honey, calm down.

1028
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,160
愤怒是一种垃圾情绪
Anger is a junk emotion,

1029
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,980
放下吧
okay, let it go.

1030
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,880
轮不到你来告诉我冷静
Don't you tell me to calm down.

1031
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,940
我受够了听你说要爱自己
I'm fucking tired of feeling like shit

1032
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,480
听得我自己都恶心
because you tell me to love myself.

1033
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,770
爱你自己是全世界
Loving yourself is the most natural thing

1034
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,920
最自然不过的事  亲爱的
in the world, sweetie.

1035
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,750
人们在童年就忘记了
People unlearn it in childhood.

1036
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,130
你知道他们为什么会忘记吗
You know why they unlearn it?

1037
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,120
因为是被像你这种人给摧毁的
Because people like you torment them.

1038
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,010
不
No.

1039
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,630
莱克斯
Lex.

1040
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,570
阿莱克西斯
Alexis!

1041
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,570
阿莱克西斯
Alexis!

1042
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,490
你到底怎么回事
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1043
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,470
你要去哪里
Where the fuck are you going?

1044
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:23,750
盯住她
Watch her.

1045
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:42,660
克洛
Chlo.

1046
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,130
我不知道
I have no idea

1047
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,760
莱克斯说的关于凯尔西的事
what Lex is talking about with Kelsey.

1048
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,080
但她的确说了一些
But she did say something...

1049
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,390
我曾经忽视的事
I may have overlooked in the past.

1050
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,480
很抱歉我以前在高中
I am so sorry about the way I treated you

1051
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,490
那样对你
in high school.

1052
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,460
如果我可以收回我所做的一切
If I could take it all back,

1053
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,320
我肯定会的
I would.

1054
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,990
我已经不是当初的那个我了
I'm not that person anymore,

1055
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,710
虽然说再多遍也不够
and I can't say it enough,

1056
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,820
但我还是要说对不起
but I'm sorry.

1057
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,090
非常感谢你这么说
Well, I appreciate you saying that.

1058
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:27,900
谢谢
Thank you.

1059
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,850
宝贝
Lovebug.

1060
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,250
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

1061
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,610
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

1062
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,790
-我想你  -我也很想你
- I miss you. - I miss you too.

1063
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:37,900
你今晚怎么不回来
Why don't you come back tonight?

1064
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,480
你要睡在那里吗
Do you have to sleep over?

1065
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,540
嗯  我的车坏了  所以我得...
Yeah, my car broke down, so I have to--

1066
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:42,690
我被困在这边了
I'm just kind of stuck here.

1067
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:43,640
我得等阿莱克西斯
I gotta wait for Alexis

1068
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,160
把我捎回去  所以
to give me a ride back down, so...

1069
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,700
你要我来接你吗
Do you want me to come get you?

1070
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:47,500
不用
No.

1071
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,880
不用  我准备直接去休息了
No, I'll just go to sleep

1072
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,770
我们明天见
and I will see you tomorrow.

1073
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,260
基拉  开门
Kaela? Open the door.

1074
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,140
我就是不知道为什么
I just don't know why

1075
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,500
有人会做出这种事
someone would do something like this.

1076
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,960
即使我根本没有那样做
Like, setting aside the fact

1077
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,700
也要到处宣扬
that telling people

1078
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,970
是我霸凌凯尔西
I bullied Kelsey to death

1079
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,410
而导致她的死亡
could destroy my career,

1080
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,650
根本不管这样会毁掉我的事业
even though it's something I didn't even do,

1081
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,900
那样不仅仅会伤害到我  克洛
it wouldn't just hurt me, Chlo.

1082
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,200
还会伤害到很多其他人
It would hurt a lot of other people too.

1083
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,470
很多年轻的女性来找我求助
Young women rely on me for help.

1084
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,010
寻求我的鼓励
For inspiration.

1085
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,720
我真的很为她感到难过
I feel really bad for her.

1086
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,560
她对未来抱有么多的
Like, she had all of these hopes and dreams

1087
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,060
希望和梦想  但是
about the future, but...

1088
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,220
她就是什么都做不成
she just has nothing going for her,

1089
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,980
没有潜力
and no potential.

1090
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,720
是吗
Yeah?

1091
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,540
我也是
Well, neither do I.

1092
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,030
所以去你妈的
So fuck you.

1093
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,820
什么
What?

1094
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,900
克洛伊  不是那样的
Chloe, that is not true.

1095
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,770
-这只是你自己这么告诉自己而已  -随便吧
- That is a story you tell yourself. - Whatever.

1096
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,720
你很风趣
You're funny,

1097
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,670
真诚
honest,

1098
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,280
性感
sexy.

1099
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,960
你能成为你想成为的任何样子
I mean, you can be whatever you want.

1100
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,970
你根本不知道你自己有多么优秀
You have no idea how good you are.

1101
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,220
-你好  -怎么了
- Hey. - What's up?

1102
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,250
没什么  我上个厕所
Nothing, I just had to pee.

1103
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,270
莱克斯  我从来没同意过这么做
Look, Lex, I never agreed to this, okay?

1104
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,210
你本来说只是想吓吓她
You said that the plan was just to spook her

1105
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,500
让她承认自己对凯尔西做的事
into admitting what she did to Kelsey,

1106
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,010
但她说自己没有做过
but she said she didn't do that stuff.

1107
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,120
基拉  当然是她做的了
Kaela, of course she did that stuff.

1108
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,210
怎么  你觉得是我编的吗
What, you think I'm making it up?

1109
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,590
上帝啊
Jesus Christ.

1110
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,480
我们绝对会逼问出来
Look, we're gonna get it out of her,

1111
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,280
只需要再给她一点压力
we just need to push her a little further.

1112
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,280
我感觉不是很好
I'm not comfortable with that.

1113
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,780
我不会折磨人的
I'm not gonna torture someone.

1114
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,510
你说什么呢
What the fuck?

1115
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,010
我们没有折磨她
We're not torturing her.

1116
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,690
好吧  随便吧
Fine, whatever.

1117
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,630
我只是
I just--

1118
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,370
我没有同意事情进行到这种程度
I didn't agree for it to go this far.

1119
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,990
这种程度  你本来指望怎么样
This far? Well, what did you expect?

1120
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,380
那房间里的那个女人是个疯子
The woman in that room's a psychopath

1121
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,420
她害死了一个无辜的人
responsible for the death of an innocent person,

1122
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,010
我们需要保护其他女孩不遭她的毒手
and we need to protect other girls from her evil.

1123
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,900
丹妮尔不邪恶
Danielle's not evil.

1124
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,650
听着  我本来
Look, I wasn't gonna--

1125
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,750
我本来不想
I wasn't gonna bring this up

1126
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,390
在其他女孩面前提这件事  但是
in front of the other girls, obviously, but...

1127
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,720
杰西在找人
Jesse is looking for someone

1128
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,180
来接替我的频道空缺出的位置
to take over my segment on their channel,

1129
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,980
我可以来选择我的接班人
and I get to be the one to pick my replacement.

1130
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,670
老实说
And to be honest,

1131
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,360
我今晚来这里的一大原因
the main reason I came here tonight

1132
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,530
是因为我感觉
was because I had a feeling

1133
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,990
你可能很合适
you might be a good fit.

1134
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:31,660
真的吗
Really?

1135
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,870
我是认真的  克洛
I'm serious, Chlo.

1136
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,240
你最好别耍我
You better not be fucking with me right now.

1137
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,930
我为什么要耍你
Why would I be fucking with you?

1138
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,130
你不如来洛杉矶
Look, why don't you just come out to LA

1139
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,790
和我住一段时间
and...stay with me for a little bit?

1140
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,900
我们可以一起
We can come up with a pitch

1141
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,360
给你想个适合你的环节
for your segment together.

1142
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,380
我能带你转转
I can bring you around,

1143
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,670
把你介绍给别人
introduce you to people.

1144
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,570
男人们
To guys.

1145
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,440
肯定会很有趣
I mean, it'll be really fun.

1146
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,510
嗯
Yeah.

1147
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:09,920
克洛伊
Chloe.

1148
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,600
我知道你很受伤
I know that you're hurting.

1149
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,250
我知道你用你的玩笑来掩盖你的痛苦
I know the pain you're covering up with your jokes.

1150
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,070
我知道你很孤单
I know you're lonely.

1151
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,630
我知道你很担心你的母亲
I know you're worried about your mother.

1152
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,150
但我可以为你改变这一切
But I can change all of that for you.

1153
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,000
我们可以改变那一切
We can change all of that.

1154
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,080
一起
Together.

1155
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,240
我们只需要先解决眼前
We just gotta deal with this situation first.

1156
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,190
她专门挑
She's preying on people

1157
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,210
跟凯尔西一样没安全感的人下手
who are as insecure as Kelsey was.

1158
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:50,920
如果那还不算邪恶
If that's not evil,

1159
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,260
我不知道什么还算
then I don't know what is.

1160
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,480
也许她没有直接说他们是没用的废物
Maybe she doesn't call them vile losers,

1161
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,020
但她绝对让他们将自己与她对比时
but she sure as hell makes them feel like that

1162
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,470
有这种感觉
when they compare themselves to her.

1163
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:59,500
而且她还会
And she's doing it all

1164
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,280
披着帮助人的外衣
under the guise of helping people.

1165
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,930
-也许她是在帮助人  -不要有这种想法  基拉
- Maybe she is. - Don't start, Kaela.

1166
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,260
你之前同意这么做的
You agreed to do this.

1167
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,310
不能中途放弃
You're not bailing.

1168
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,510
阿莱克西斯  阿莱克西斯
Alexis--Alexis!

1169
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,140
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1170
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,680
绑得更紧点
Tightening the ties.

1171
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,170
真相早晚会浮出水面  丹妮尔
The truth is gonna come out, Danielle.

1172
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,010
不管用什么办法
One way or another.

1173
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,730
我们不会放过你
We're not gonna leave you alone

1174
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,310
除非你承认
until you admit

1175
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,190
你对凯尔西做了什么
what you did to Kelsey.

1176
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,700
莱克斯
Lex.

1177
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,410
那道疤不是我给你留下的
I didn't give you that scar.

1178
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,890
而是凯尔西
Kelsey did.

1179
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,010
克洛伊  住手
Chloe, stop!

1180
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:20,900
伙计们  你们要受到惩罚
Guys, you're being punished.

1181
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,570
怎么回事
What's going on?

1182
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,830
她们把我们锁在了这里
They locked us in here.

1183
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,080
我们出不去
We can't get out.

1184
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,590
伙计们  拜托
Guys, come on, please.

1185
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,940
伙计们
Guys.

1186
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,230
她不会让我们离开这儿的
Fuck, she's not gonna let us out of here.

1187
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,040
她疯了
She's fucking insane.

1188
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,360
她他妈的疯了
She's out of her fucking mind.

1189
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,090
她们不会来的  基拉
They're not gonna come, Kaela.

1190
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,000
好吧  但是克洛伊会来的  克洛伊
Fine! But Chloe will come. Chloe!

1191
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,840
不  她们俩都不会来的
No, neither of them are gonna come.

1192
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,920
我告诉你  她疯了
I'm telling you, she's fucking insane.

1193
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,040
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1194
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,980
你才疯了  阿莱克西斯
You're insane, Alexis!

1195
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,890
拜托  拜托
Come on, guys, please, please!

1196
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,280
别浪费体力了
Stop wasting your energy.

1197
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:20,640
那怎么办
So what?

1198
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,330
就这么死在蒸汽房里吗
Just gonna die in a steam room?

1199
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,030
我当初是想如果我同意这样做的话
I thought if I just went along with this,

1200
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,540
你可以结束这一切
you could get some closure

1201
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,390
开始新的生活
and move on with your life.

1202
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,510
所以呢
So what?

1203
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,110
她取笑我是同性恋
So she made fun of me for being gay.

1204
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,200
我不在乎
I don't care.

1205
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,690
我有一个很棒的女朋友
I have a great fucking girlfriend

1206
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,730
我可能再也见不到她了
who I'm maybe never gonna see again

1207
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,860
因为我要死在蒸汽房里了
because I'm gonna die in a steam room.

1208
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,760
这太蠢了
This is so stupid.

1209
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,030
你不想想起她吗
You don't want to think about her?

1210
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,480
那就别上"照片墙"
Don't go on Instagram.

1211
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,790
谁会在乎她是不是网红呢
Who cares if she's some dumb internet celebrity?

1212
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,230
你不必看她的动态
You don't have to look at her stuff.

1213
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,480
你为什么不走出去  或者找条狗
Why don't you go outside or get a fucking dog?

1214
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,030
像你一直说的那样  完成你的学业
Finish your degree like you're always talking about.

1215
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,810
你们这些人太愚蠢了
You guys suck so fucking much.

1216
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:05,070
你们是全世界最蠢的人
You're the stupidest fucking people in the entire world.

1217
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,710
操
Fuck.

1218
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,560
操他妈的
Jesus fuck.

1219
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:20,500
弗兰基来电

1220
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,510
吸气
Inhale.

1221
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,800
然后说一遍咒语
And now repeat the mantra.

1222
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,580
没有什么能够阻挡我的向往
Nothing stands between me and all of my desires.

1223
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,080
没有什么能够阻挡我的向往
Nothing stands between me and all of my desires.

1224
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,720
很好
Perfect.

1225
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:52,670
当你感到思绪神游或是焦虑的时候
So any time you feel your mind wandering or you're getting anxious,

1226
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,750
反复多念几遍这句咒语
just repeat that mantra as many times as you need

1227
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:00,210
然后你会对接下来发生的事感到惊讶的
and you will be amazed at the things that start to happen for you.

1228
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:06,970
没有什么能够阻挡我的向往
Nothing stands between me and all of my desires.

1229
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,180
没错
Yes.

1230
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,400
还要多久
How much longer?

1231
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,570
我觉得几个小时就好
Um, I think a couple hours should be fine.

1232
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,170
然后呢
What then?

1233
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,680
然后我们报警
Then we'll call the cops,

1234
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,990
告诉警察  在我们看电影的时候
tell them that they got stuck in the steam room

1235
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,480
她们被困在了蒸汽房里
when we were watching a movie,

1236
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:36,450
我们找到她们的时候  她们已经死了
and they were dead when we found them.

1237
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:38,520
等等  什么
Wait, what?

1238
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,080
怎么了
What?

1239
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,320
我以为我们的计划只是
I--I just thought the plan was, like,

1240
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,810
吓唬她们
to scare them, you know,

1241
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,350
这样她们就不会散播谣言之类的了
so they wouldn't spread lies or whatever.

1242
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,240
是的  是这样
Oh yeah, no, it was.

1243
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,800
如果我相信她们不会散播那些
I mean, if I trusted that they wouldn't spread

1244
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,720
足以毁掉我们的谣言的话
these terrible rumors that could ruin us,

1245
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,350
我就会放她们走  但是...
I would let them go, but...

1246
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,480
在这方面你比我更了解她们
I mean, you know them better than I do at this point.

1247
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:06,610
记住  你有权掌控生活中的一切
And remember, you have utter power over everything in your life.

1248
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,710
你可以完全放心地拒绝任何事情
You can say no to anything with complete ease and trust.

1249
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:14,790
如果你觉得吓唬她们就能让她们闭嘴
If you think scaring them is enough to shut them up,

1250
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,490
那我们就吓唬她们
then we'll just scare them.

1251
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,690
我觉得可能可以
I mean, probably, yeah.

1252
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,300
好  那我们就吓唬她们
Okay, then we'll just scare them.

1253
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,150
好
Okay.

1254
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,640
我只是...
I mean, I would just...

1255
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,970
很担心如果我们放她们走了
be nervous that if we let them go

1256
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,320
她们会继续传播那些可怕的谣言
and they spread these terrible rumors,

1257
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,100
你知道网上的喷子都是什么心态吧
I mean, you know how it is with mob mentality on the internet, right?

1258
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,140
在被证明有罪之前都不是无辜的
It's not innocent until proven guilty.

1259
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:42,660
好吧
Right.

1260
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,960
或许她们会告诉警察  我们想杀了她们
Or they would tell the cops we were trying to kill them

1261
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,890
尽管我们只想吓唬吓唬她们
even though we were just trying to scare them.

1262
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,670
但说实话  无论你怎么想
But honestly, whatever you think.

1263
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,400
我不想做一些让你感觉不舒服的事
I don't want to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.

1264
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,580
你相信她们会闭嘴吗
Do you trust them not to say a word?

1265
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,880
没有什么能够阻挡我的向往
Nothing stands between me and all of my desires.

1266
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,860
该死
Shit.

1267
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,000
拜托  基拉  继续
Please. Kaela. Go on.

1268
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,240
没有什么能阻挡你的欲望
Nothing stands between you and all of your desires.

1269
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,010
好吧
Okay.

1270
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,010
糟糕  门被锁上了
Shit, shit, it's locked.

1271
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:52,990
坏了  坏了
Fuck! Fuck!

1272
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,260
她们肯定拿走了钥匙
They must have taken the key.

1273
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,290
糟糕
Shit.

1274
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:09,980
在搞我吗
Fucking me?

1275
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,180
糟糕  打不开
Shit, it won't open.

1276
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,560
操
Fucking--

1277
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,300
再试试
Try it!

1278
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,660
我打不开
I can't get it!

1279
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,920
我打不开
I can't get it.

1280
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,760
操
Fuck.

1281
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:39,330
快点  克洛伊  你在搞什么
Come on, Chloe! What the fuck?

1282
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,240
快走
Let's go!

1283
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,360
等等
Wait.

1284
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,850
克洛伊  快点
Chloe, come on!

1285
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:58,930
去找到她们
Go find them.

1286
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,330
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1287
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,820
很抱歉我把你卷了进来
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

1288
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:09,870
没事
All right.

1289
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,120
我不知道这是怎么了
I don't know what's going on.

1290
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,160
她真是疯了
She's totally crazy.

1291
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:12,950
我要把我们弄出去
I'm gonna get us out of this.

1292
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,780
-怎么弄  -我不知道
- How? - Fuck, I don't know.

1293
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,890
我需要时间想一想
I just -- I need a second to think.

1294
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,890
所有的窗户都被封死了
All the windows are sealed.

1295
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,450
如果我能拿到我的手机
If I can just--if I can just get to my phone.

1296
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,320
她们拿走了我们的手机
They took our phones.

1297
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,050
我知道  但肯定就在楼下
I know, but they must be somewhere downstairs.

1298
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,920
如果我能拿到手机  我就能报警
If I can just get to my phone then I can call the cops.

1299
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,470
不  阿莱克西斯  听我说
No, Alexis, Alexis, listen,

1300
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,450
听我说  别一个人出去
listen to me, do not go out there alone.

1301
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,440
-我要去补救这一切  -别
- I'm gonna fix it. - No.

1302
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,280
阿莱克西斯  别  阿莱克西斯
Alexis, no, no, Alexis.

1303
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,700
没有什么能够阻挡我的向往
Nothing stands between me and all of my desires.

1304
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,250
你们在里面吗
Are you in here?

1305
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,660
基拉
Kaela?

1306
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,780
阿莱克西斯
Alexis?

1307
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,490
没事的  就我一个人
It's okay, it's just me.

1308
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,360
-就我一个人  -阿莱克西斯呢
- Okay, it's just me. - Where's Alexis?

1309
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,160
她不在这里
She's not here, okay?

1310
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,560
我们都是孤身一人
We're all alone.

1311
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:33,980
听我说  克洛
Listen, Chlo.

1312
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,880
我不知道丹妮尔跟你说了什么
I don't know what Danielle said to you,

1313
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,330
但我们可以从这一切中脱身
but we can still walk away from this.

1314
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,730
好吗
Okay?

1315
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:45,580
你和我
You and me,

1316
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,680
我们可以离开这里
we can just walk away.

1317
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,460
我们需要做的
All we need to do is just...

1318
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,390
就是打电话报警  告诉警察她疯了
just call the cops and tell them that she went nuts.

1319
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,580
我不可能打电话报警
There's no fucking way I'm calling the cops.

1320
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,800
不可能
No fucking way.

1321
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,410
克洛伊  我不会告诉警察你参与到其中
Chloe, I would never tell them that you were part of this.

1322
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,820
我不会这么做的
I would never do that.

1323
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,260
克洛伊  拜托
Chloe, come on.

1324
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,180
你相信我  对吗
You trust me, right?

1325
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:12,850
听我说  我们可以...
Look, we can just...

1326
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,840
我们可以离开这里
We can just leave.

1327
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,780
我们现在就得走了
We gotta go right now.

1328
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:23,730
你现在就可以转身离开
We can just walk away right now.

1329
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:26,350
好吗
Yeah?

1330
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,670
拜托  克洛伊  就咱们两个
Come on, Chloe, you and me.

1331
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:30,300
相信我
Trust me.

1332
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,890
我们可以回家
We'll just go home

1333
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:36,820
然后回到我们的正常生活
and we can go back to our normal lives, okay--

1334
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,660
我不想回到正常生活
I don't want to go back to my normal life.

1335
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,070
克洛伊  拜托  别这么想
Chloe, come on, stop it.

1336
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,280
我的正常生活像屎一样
My normal life is shit.

1337
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,350
放开我  你弄疼我了
Let go of me, you're hurting--

1338
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:43,950
-你就想让我继续不起眼下去  -放开我
- You just want me to stay small. - Stop it!

1339
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,180
你不想让我成功
You don't want me to succeed!

1340
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,310
放开我
Let go of me!

1341
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,270
操
Fuck!

1342
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:28,140
出来吧  莱克斯
Come out, Lex!

1343
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,910
我们不想伤害你
We weren't trying to hurt you.

1344
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,690
我们只是想吓唬你
We were just trying to scare you.

1345
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:52,180
如果你保证不再说凯尔西的那些事
And if you promise not to say anything about this Kelsey stuff,

1346
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,080
我们可以当这一切没发生过
we can just let all of this go.

1347
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:13,760
基拉
Kaela.

1348
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,630
基拉
Kaela!

1349
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,340
不
No.

1350
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:23,400
不
No.

1351
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,490
糟糕
Ow, fuck!

1352
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,310
操
Fuck!

1353
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,240
怎么了  克洛
What's wrong, Chlo?

1354
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,610
我...
I...

1355
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,190
我杀了基拉
I killed Kaela.

1356
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,580
天呐  克洛
Wow, Chlo.

1357
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:26,800
那是意外
It was an accident.

1358
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,050
我抓住了她
I--I went to grab her

1359
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,290
然后她...我的老天
and she just--oh my God.

1360
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,130
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1361
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,640
你终于把你自己放在第一位了
You're finally putting yourself first.

1362
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,490
这样才能实现你的梦想
That is how you achieve your dreams.

1363
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,980
我感到很骄傲
I'm really impressed.

1364
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,510
你在争取你一直想要的一切
You're really manifesting everything you've always wanted.

1365
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,110
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1366
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,780
是一场意外
It was an accident.

1367
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,100
意外难免会发生
Accidents happen.

1368
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,520
我们唯一能控制的
The only thing we can control

1369
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,320
就是如何处理我们现有的情况
is how we handle our given circumstances.

1370
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,580
而你处理得很好
And you handled it so beautifully.

1371
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:37,110
没有什么能够阻挡我的向往
Nothing stands between me and all of my desires.

1372
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,050
是谁在按门铃
Who the fuck is that?

1373
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,410
糟糕  是弗兰基  基拉的女朋友
Shit, it's Frankie, Kaela's girlfriend.

1374
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,750
她来干什么
What the fuck is she doing here?

1375
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:57,350
我他妈怎么会知道
How the fuck should I know?

1376
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:58,300
我们怎么办
What do we do?

1377
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,180
好吧
Okay. Um...

1378
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,890
有人吗
Hello?

1379
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,090
我有办法了
Okay, I've got it.

1380
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,180
我们放她进来
We let her in.

1381
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:06,930
当她走神的时候
When she isn't looking, you get the knife

1382
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,490
你拿把刀  把她处理了
and you take care of her, okay?

1383
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,830
警察来了之后
Then when the cops come,

1384
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:12,580
我们就说她来这儿是因为
we'll say that she showed up in a fit of jealousy

1385
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:15,390
基拉和她分手了  她很嫉妒  想报仇
because Kaela broke up with her and she wanted revenge.

1386
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,880
天呐  你真擅长撒谎
God, you're good at this.

1387
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,100
这个故事编得很完美
And it's kind of an amazing story

1388
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,250
因为我可以为自己辩称正当防卫
because then I can do a whole segment on, like, self defense.

1389
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,730
你同意这么做吗
You okay to do this?

1390
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,480
好吧
Mm-hm. Okay.

1391
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,470
让她进来
Let her in.

1392
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:36,840
好
Okay.

1393
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,720
弗兰基  你好
Frankie, hey!

1394
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,970
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1395
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,560
基拉之前打电话给我
Um, Kaela called earlier, so I...

1396
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,820
天呐  你就是弗兰基
Oh my God, you're Frankie!

1397
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:53,490
我的天
Oh my God.

1398
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,550
见到你很高兴
It is so nice to meet you.

1399
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:57,350
我久仰你的大名
I have heard so much about you.

1400
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:00,240
基拉特别爱你
Kaela is absolutely in love with you.

1401
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,540
我也特别爱她
Well, the feeling is mutual.

1402
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,850
我是丹妮尔
I'm Danielle.

1403
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,520
-很高兴见到你  -我也是
- Nice to meet you. - You too.

1404
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,560
久仰大名
Heard a lot about you.

1405
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:08,920
真好
That's sweet.

1406
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:09,950
基拉还好吗
Is Kaela okay?

1407
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,200
不然呢
Yeah, why wouldn't she be?

1408
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:12,260
当然还好啦
Of course.

1409
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,060
这话是什么意思
What do you mean?

1410
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,690
她看起来很心烦
She just seemed upset and...

1411
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,920
而且她不接电话
uh, she's not answering her phone.

1412
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,880
她很想你啊
Oh, she just missed you.

1413
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,150
她已经睡着了
She already fell asleep.

1414
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,190
女生都会闹小脾气  对吧
I mean, classic K, right?

1415
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,650
没错  她沾枕头就着
Yeah, she's pretty much head to pillow.

1416
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:33,000
我忘了点事  失陪一下
Oh, shit, I forgot something. sorry.

1417
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,730
她坚持到了12点吗
Did she make it to midnight?

1418
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,660
是的
She did.

1419

其实我们都坚持到了

1420
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:48,190
我妹妹为你痴迷
My sister is obsessed with you.

1421

她看你所有的视频  做锻炼

1422
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:55,520
不吃奶制品  不吃麸质
Um, no dairy, no gluten,

1423
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:59,230
她对你宣传的果汁很感兴趣
and she got really into the juices you advertise,

1424
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,620
就是那个  有很多蔬菜的那个
the, uh... Very Very Vegetables.

1425
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,660
-是的  -没错

1426
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,920
没错  有很多蔬菜的那个
Yes, the Very Very Vegetables.

1427
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,030
你需要我看一下保险丝盒之类的吗
Do you want me to take a look at the fuse box or anything?

1428
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,300
你人真好
Oh, you're so sweet.

1429
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,190
不用了  没事的
No, it's okay.

1430
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:13,360
反正我们也要去睡觉了
Um, we're heading to bed soon anyway.

1431
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,700
好吧
All right.

1432
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:36,360
天啊
Holy shit.

1433
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,780
干得漂亮  克洛
Good job, Chlo.

1434
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,520
过来
Come here.

1435
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:54,650
你还好吗
Okay?

1436
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,670
你干得很漂亮
You did so good.

1437
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,090
我们会把你送到洛杉矶
We're gonna get you to L.A., okay?

1438
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:04,260
我们今晚就把你送走
We're gonna get you out of here tonight.

1439
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,500
你会得到你想要的一切
You are gonna get everything you've always wanted.

1440
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:17,670
没有什么能够阻挡我的向往
Nothing stands between me and all of my desires.

1441
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,510
是时候向前看了  阿莱克西斯
It's time to move on, Alexis.

1442
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:02,080
是时候治愈你自己了

1443
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,210
是时候放下过去了
It's time to say yes to letting go.

1444
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,470
你的生活不必太紧张
Your life doesn't need to be tight.

1445
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,400
可以很轻松的
It can be messy.

1446
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,470
-不要再克制和遵守规矩了  -没有什么能够
- Let go of control and order. - Nothing stands between me...

1447
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,640
-你只是大海中的一根针  -阻挡我的向往
- You're just chum in the water. - ...and all of my desires.

1448
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,550
放弃吧
Give up.

1449
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,230
从容接受你的命运吧
Relax into your destiny.

1450
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:24,900
克洛
Chlo!

1451
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,670
我的天
Oh my God!

1452
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:58,020
别再以自我为中心了
It's time to stop doing the ego dance.

1453
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:02,040
别再向外界寻求认可了
Time to stop looking to the outside world for validation.

1454
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,530
我感觉你内心充满了力量  阿莱克西斯
I see so much strength in you, Alexis.

1455
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:06,880
你只是被误导了
You're so misguided.

1456
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,180
让我来帮帮你吧
Let me help you.

1457
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,820
我们不应该是敌人
We're not supposed to be enemies.

1458
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,680
莱克斯  如果你真的以为
Lex, if you thought for one fucking second

1459
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,700
我会承认凯尔西是因我而死
I was gonna admit Kelsey died 'cause of me,

1460
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:20,010
那你真是比我想的更蠢
you were a bigger fucking idiot than I thought.

1461
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,880
我是个富婆
I'm fucking rich.

1462
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,350
你明白吗
Do you get that?

1463
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:26,910
人们崇拜我
People worship me.

1464
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,580
而这只是个开始
And this is just the beginning.

1465
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,760
我会上杂志  上电视  演电影
I'm gonna have magazines, tV shows, movies.

1466
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,810
我要去拍电影
I'm gonna be in movies

1467
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,700
你觉得我会让这个机会溜走吗
and you think I'd throw that all away?

1468
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,450
你毁了我的生活
You ruined my life!

1469
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,440
你夺走了一切
You took everything!

1470
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,760
我受够了
I got stuck with this.

1471
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,940
本来是我
It should have been me.

1472
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:44,960
应该是我的
It was supposed to be me.

1473
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,850
我那么努力
I worked so hard!

1474
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:48,730
你觉得应该是你
You think it was supposed to be you,

1475
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:50,220
你这个可悲的傻蛋
you pathetic piece of shit?

1476
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,560
你是个废物
You're a fucking loser!

1477
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,330
你狗屁不是
You are nothing!

1478
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,490
你这个透明人
You're invisible!

1479
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,390
你这个可悲的傻蛋
You pathetic piece of shit!

1480
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:05,590
你永远达不到我的高度
You could never achieve what I've achieved.

1481
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,700
你永远得不到我所拥有的
You could never have what I have.

1482
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:09,320
你狗屁不是
You are nothing!

1483
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,200
我掌管我自己的命运
I control my destiny!

1484
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,640
我掌管着我所拥有的
I control what I hold onto,

1485
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:21,500
我掌管着我所放弃的
and I control what I let go!

1486
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:25,290
各位好
Hey guys.

1487
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,770
正如你们所得知的那样
As I'm sure many of you heard,

1488
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,560
我们亲爱的朋友和播主
our dear friend and contributor

1489
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,050
《健康起来  丹妮尔》在新年当天
Get Well Danielle passed away

1490
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,230
去世了
on New Year's Day.

1491
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,930
今天和我们一起纪念她的
And here with us today to help us remember her

1492
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,320
是她最好的朋友  阿莱克西斯
is her best friend, Alexis.

1493
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,520
感谢你今天前来  阿莱克西斯
Thank you for joining us, Alexis.

1494
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:40,130
谢谢你们邀请我
Thank you for having me.

1495
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:43,840
我看了新闻报道
So, I read on the news,

1496
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,300
我不想讲得太可怕
and I don't want to get too gruesome here,

1497
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:50,080
但是是你们一个朋友吃醋的恋人干的吗
but it was a jealous lover of one of your friends?

1498
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,540
是的  丹妮尔鼓励我们的朋友基拉
Yes, Danielle had encouraged

1499
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,090
她值得拥有更好的生活
our friend Kaela that she deserved better,

1500
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,210
她应该开始全新的一年
that she should start the new year fresh

1501
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:00,550
找一个真正爱她的人
and find someone who really loved her.

1502
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:06,280
我猜基拉的爱人很伤心  失去了理智
And I guess Kaela's partner just took it really hard and lost it.

1503
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,950
你最想让全世界记住丹妮尔的什么
What do you want the world to remember most about Danielle?

1504
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,680
很难挑出一件事
It's hard to just pick one thing.

1505
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:15,570
她是个完美的人
She was a wonderful person.

1506
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:21,170
我知道她不想让我沉浸在悲痛之中
And I know she'd just want me to move through this

1507
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,520
她想让我过充实的生活
and live my fullest life.

1508
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:28,160
这段经历教会了我许多
This experience has taught me so much,

1509
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:32,330
特别是正当防卫的重要性
especially the value of self defense.

1510
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,090
没错  今天你要教我们
That's right, you're gonna teach us today

1512
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:37,040
没错
Yes, I am.

1513
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,660
包中要常备一样东西
Now there's one thing that you always need in your bag,

1514
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,140
那就是防狼喷雾
and that's pepper spray.

1515
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,350
我将给大家演示如何用日常材料
I'm gonna show you how to make your own pepper spray

1516
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:44,700
制作防狼喷雾
using household ingredients.

1517
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,630
太好了
Wow!

1518
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,110
在我们开始之前
Now before we get started,

1519
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,290
请确认你戴上了护目镜
please make sure you're wearing your protective glasses

1520
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:50,240
和橡胶手套
and your Latex gloves,

1521
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,440
因为这东西很辣
because this stuff is spicy!

1522
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,430
我的天
Oh my gosh.

1523
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:56,410
好的  我们需要醋  辣椒面
Okay, so we're gonna need vinegar, chili flakes,

1524
01:22:56,410 --> 01:23:00,970
红辣椒粉  油  一个碗和喷雾瓶
red chili powder, oil, a bowl, and a spray bottle.

1525
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,670
别惹我哦  杰西
So don't cross me, Jess.

1526
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:04,450
天呐  别喷我哦
Oh my gosh, stop it!

1527
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:05,790
你要小心啦
You watch out!
