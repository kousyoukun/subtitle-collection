{\an8}深入黑暗  第一季 第八集

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,400
你沒事吧  還好吧
You okay? It's all right?

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,740
我在哪
Where am I?

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,450
你在我的房間里
You're in my room.

20
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,370
我好冷
I'm cold.

21
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,090
你是誰
Who are you?

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,070
演奏我們的歌曲
Play our song.

23
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,340
你喜歡紅酒的
You like wine.

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,380
是嗎
Do I?

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,390
我在努力
I'm trying.

26
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,680
但是...
But, um...

27
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,480
什么都記不得
There's nothing.

28
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,650
一點也不嗎
Nothing?

29
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,200
不記得
No.

30
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,420
我們相遇的那晚也不記得嗎
Not even the night we met?

31
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,880
我們相遇的那晚
The night we met?

32
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:17,980
{\an8}我們摧毀的一切

33
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,060
完事了
It's done.

34
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,670
{\an8}斯賓塞

35
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,870
我回頭寫
I'll get to it.

36
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,590
感覺有什么不同嗎
Did it feel any different?

37
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,260
好吧
Fine.

38
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,840
我給你寫下來
I'll write it down for you.

39
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,890
沒有
And no.

40
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
感覺完全不像她
Didn't feel anything like her.

41
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,390
{\an8}呼入  帕克
地點未知

42
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,010
怎么樣了
How's it going?

43
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,110
我在盡我所能幫他
I'm doing everything I can to help him

44
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,430
他卻毫無反饋
and he gives me nothing.

45
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,310
你還要再做嗎
So are you going to do it again?

46
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,320
他需要幫助
He needs help.

47
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,330
我就是在幫他
That's what I'm doing.

48
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,610
臨床治療
Clinical help.

49
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,670
他們會把他奪走
They'll take him from me.

50
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,910
那就很糟嗎
Would that be so terrible?

51
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,030
我擔心  小維
I'm worried, Vic.

52
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,120
-我可以保護他  -那你呢
- I can protect him. - What about you?

53
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,460
你要為他做到什么程度
I mean, how far are you willing to go for him?

54
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,720
你在他的那本日記里是永遠找不到全部真相的
He'll never give you the whole truth in that journal of his.

55
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,630
你得親眼看到他那么做才能理解
You need to see him in the act to understand.

56
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,800
我不能
I can't.

57
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,610
你知道我觀察實驗
You know I can't observe the experiment

58
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,150
會影響結果
without altering the results.

59
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,150
扯淡的借口
Bullshit excuse.

60
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,610
就算有觀察偏倚
Even with observation bias,

61
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,030
親眼觀察也能比轉述獲取更多準確數據
the firsthand accounting yields more accurate data than hearsay.

62
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,970
怎么觀察
How?

63
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,060
錄下他
Record him.

64
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,600
留下證據鏈嗎
And create a chain of evidence?

65
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,310
用直播信號
Start a live feed.

66
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,860
只有這樣才能真正知道
It's the only way to really know.

67
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,640
你是她嗎
Are you her?

68
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,060
你是別人嗎
Are you someone else?

69
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,060
-我是我吧  -你確定嗎
- I'm me? - Are you sure?

70
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,610
我不知道
I don't know.

71
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,160
你還記得我嗎
Do you even remember me?

72
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,410
-不  -記起我
- No. - Remember me!

73
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,540
演奏我們的歌曲
Play our song.

74
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,660
我想走
I want to go.

75
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
{\an8}信號丟失

76
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,560
滾下我的車
Get the fuck out of my car.

77
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,540
-滾出來  -你不能丟下我
- Get the fuck out of here.  - You can't fucking leave me!

78
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,570
-滾開  -我都不知道我在哪
- Fuck off! - I don't know where the fuck I am!

79
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,900
湯米
Tommy!

80
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,700
去你的
Fuck you!

81
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,290
你個混蛋
You piece of shit.

82
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,580
搞什么
What the fuck?

83
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,500
該死
Fuck!

84
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,560
{\an8}媽媽在追蹤你的位置

85
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,550
{\an8}你要接近半英里地標了  你在散步嗎

86
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,320
{\an8}對

87
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
{\an8}我要工作到很晚  我希望你天黑前回家

88
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,040
把我丟在這荒無人煙的地方
Left me out here in the middle of nowhere

89
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,690
還不給我電話
without a fucking phone.

90
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,340
我發誓  如果我再見到你
I swear to God if I ever see you again,

91
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,160
我一定要殺了你
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

92
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,660
該死的混蛋
Fucking dick!

93
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,080
混蛋  我發誓
Piece of shit. I swear to God.

94
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,760
該死
Shit.

95
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,580
抱歉
Sorry.

96
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,830
無意嚇到你的
Didn't meant to startle you.

97
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,590
你知道你走錯路了吧
You know you're goin' the wrong way?

98
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,340
你怎么知道我要往哪走
How do you know which way I'm going?

99
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,360
你在步行  如果你繼續往那邊走
Well, you're on foot, so... if you keep goin' that way,

100
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,930
你要在黑夜里走一宿了
you're gonna be walking in the dark all night.

101
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,100
好吧  但你怎么走到這兒的
Yeah, but how'd you get here?

102
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,890
我住在那邊半英里的地方
I live about half mile that way.

103
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,890
那邊還有什么東西嗎
Is there anything else that direction?

104
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,160
有個小鎮
I mean, there's a town,

105
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,560
但那要走六個小時
but that's, like, a six-hour walk.

106
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,520
你有車嗎
You got a car?

107
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,730
沒有
No.

108
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,240
那看來我們得去你家了
Well, I guess we're going to your place then.

109
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,450
不行嗎
Is that a problem?

110
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,120
沒事
That's all right.

111
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,500
好
Okay.

112
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,130
凍死我了
It's fucking freezing.

113
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,940
你要把你的外衣借給我嗎
You gonna give me your jacket or?

114
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,390
好  抱歉
Oh, yeah, sorry.

115
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,680
給
Here.

116
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,270
你叫什么
You got a name?

117
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,480
斯賓塞
Spencer.

118
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,070
我是艾什莉
I'm Ashley.

119
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,170
這樣不行
This isn't working.

120
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,690
感覺不...
It just doesn't feel--

121
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,720
為什么
Why?

122
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,890
-為什么不行  -因為這太扯了
- Why isn't it working?  - Because it's bullshit.

123
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,600
是假的
It's fake.

124
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,410
我在努力了  斯賓塞  真的
I am trying, Spencer, I really am,

125
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,160
但如果你不幫我  我就不能幫你
but if you don't help me, I can't help you.

126
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,660
這才是第四次嘗試
This is only our fourth attempt,

127
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,040
我并不想一直把你關在這里
and I don't want to keep you locked up in here,

128
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,740
但如果你再出去
but if you go out again and...

129
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,620
我不想失去你
I don't want to lose you.

130
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,250
再給我點時間吧
Just give me a little more time.

131
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,790
好
Okay.

132
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,200
你個該死的
God damn you.

133
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,450
我不需要看到那個
I didn't need to see that.

134
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,980
你需要
Yes, you did.

135
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,900
你想幫忙滿足他的需要
You want to help satisfy his needs.

136
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,650
以免他真殺掉什么人
Keep him from killing anybody real.

137
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,610
那你就需要看到他那么做
Then you need to witness him in the act.

138
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,240
你只是想讓我有負罪感
You just wanted to make me feel guilty.

139
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,830
像個共犯
Complicit.

140
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,800
-你不是嗎  -我需要你的建議
- Aren't you? - I need your advice.

141
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,660
他也是你的責任
He's your responsibility too.

142
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,870
你了解到了什么
What did you learn?

143
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,830
你看到了什么
What did you see?

144
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,590
他是對的
He's right.

145
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,170
不夠真實
It's not real enough.

146
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,940
能達到那個真實度嗎
Will it ever be enough

147
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,800
讓他不去再殺別人
to keep him from killing someone else?

148
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,940
{\an8}泰勒  呼入

149
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,860
你要怎么
What are you going to do

150
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,890
讓下一個更真實
to make the next one more real?

151
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,240
我要多花點時間陪她
I'm going to spend more time with her,

152
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,020
給她關注  同情心
give her attention, compassion.

153
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,750
你能在模擬物上投入多少時間
How much time can you give the analogue

154
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,370
而不影響你的工作
without interfering with your work?

155
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,870
這就是我的工作
This is my work.

156
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,750
我是指哈里斯基因的工作
I mean Harris Genetics.

157
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,320
你的公司
You know, your company?

158
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,800
我的公司就要推出
My company is about to roll out

159
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,160
世界首個定制克隆器官了
the world's first custom-grown cloned organs.

160
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,870
我們將完全占有器官移植行業
We're going to own the transplant business.

161
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,330
但他們發現了你的缺席  是吧
But they have noticed your absence, yes?

162
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
如果我是個男人
If I were a man,

163
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,420
他們就會說我是古怪或天才
they'd call me an eccentric or a genius.

164
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,920
而不是一個保護欲過度的母親嗎
Instead of an overprotective mother?

165
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,740
我們能說句話嗎
Can we have a word?

166
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,490
她好了嗎
Is she done?

167
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,040
它...她在客臥
It-- she's in the guest bedroom.

168
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,420
我想讓她在那里待會兒
And I'd like to keep her there for a while,

169
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,290
與你隔絕開
away from you.

170
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,630
我覺得那會大有幫助
I think it would be really helpful.

171
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,190
這房子很大
It's a big house.

172
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,070
跟她保持距離應該不難
It shouldn't be too hard to stay away from her.

173
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,970
但我想給她到處走動的
But I want her to have the freedom

174
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,470
自由
to move around.

175
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,680
你乖乖在屋里待著
So stay put here in your room.

176
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,530
你可以畫畫  看電影
You can draw, watch movies.

177
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,910
你可以去散步
You can go for walks.

178
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,520
只要給我點時間
Anything to give me a little time

179
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,860
讓艾什莉
to help Ashley be...

180
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,400
更真實
more real for you.

181
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,030
好
Okay.

182
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,240
難以置信
I can't believe that.

183
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,500
不好意思
Excuse me.

184
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,220
你就打算傻站在那里嗎
Are you just gonna stand there?

185
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,940
好吧  抱歉
Right, yeah, sorry.

186
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,780
康奈爾夫婦搬走了嗎
Did the Cornells move out?

187
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,950
我父母嗎  沒
My folks? No.

188
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,670
他們去歐洲避暑了
They're just in Europe for the summer.

189
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,420
嚴格講我在替他們看房
Technically I'm watching the place for them

190
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,280
不是搬回家住
and not moving back home.

191
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,580
但感覺起來就是這樣
But that's exactly what it feels like.

192
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,510
我剛離開學校
I just left school.

193
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,850
我上了法學院
I was in law school.

194
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,750
我本以為我很想幫助他人
You know, I thought that I really wanted to help people,

195
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,170
但我覺得我其實只想做點有創意的事
but I think actually I just want to do something creative.

196
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,460
知道嗎
You know?

197
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,760
嗯
Yeah.

198
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,400
我真混蛋
I'm such a jerk.

199
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,440
你在幫我
Here you are helping me,

200
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,410
我還沒問你的名字呢
and I haven't even asked you your name yet.

201
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,680
我是瑪麗莎
I'm Marissa.

202
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,390
斯賓塞
Spencer.

203
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,120
好  你住這附近嗎
Cool, do you live around here?

204
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,370
嗯  在那邊半英里的地方
Yeah, I live about half mile that way.

205
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,560
好
Oh, good.

206
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,040
我很高興有人住這里
I'm glad somebody lives out here.

207
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,210
我本來還有點慌張
I was getting a little freaked out

208
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,860
這里會只有我
that I'd be here by myself.

209
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,380
你要接嗎
You need to get that?

210
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,220
不
No.

211
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,490
就是我媽
It's just my mom.

212
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,180
她每天打來查崗
She calls every day to check in.

213
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,450
挺煩人的
It's kind of annoying.

214
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,000
我沒耽誤你什么吧
I'm not keeping you from anything, am I?

215
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,400
沒有
No, I'm-- no.

216
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,840
你可以幫我
Would you maybe be able to help me

217
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,070
把剩下的東西搬進屋里嗎
get the rest of this stuff in the house?

218
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,550
嗯  當然
Yeah, that's-- that's fine.

219
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,900
好啊
Okay, cool.

220
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,430
你可以搬下那個嗎
If you could just grab that stuff.

221
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,400
你是斯賓塞的媽媽吧
You must be Spencer's mom.

222
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,480
是的
Yes.

223
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,900
怎么了
Why?

224
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,150
他在嗎  我為他做了這些餅干
Is he here? I made these cookies for him.

225
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,740
抱歉  我無意失禮  但...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but--

226
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,660
他今天幫我搬家來著
He helped me get moved in today.

227
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,750
我是瑪麗莎·康奈爾
I'm Marissa Cornell.

228
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,410
我父母的房子就在路那邊
My folks own the place down the road.

229
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,000
斯賓塞
Spence!

230
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,560
我并不想占用
Well, listen, I don't want to take up

231
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,020
你們太多時間
a bunch of your time or anything.

232
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,710
我只是想以此感謝你幫我忙
I just made these to show my appreciation for all the help.

233
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,760
你兒子太好心了
Your son's awfully nice.

234
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,590
多謝你這么說
That's very nice of you to say.

235
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,640
那好吧
Okay, well,

236
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,160
我還要收拾東西
I've got some boxes to unpack,

237
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,770
那我就不打擾了
so I'll leave you be.

238
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,660
回見了  斯賓塞
See you later, Spence.

239
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,850
認識你很高興
It was nice to meet you.

240
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,870
你怎么想的
What the fuck are you thinking?

241
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,300
就是幾個箱子  媽媽
It was just a few boxes, Mom.

242
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,080
沒什么大不了的
It's no big deal.

243
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,580
她還給他做了餅干
She made him cookies.

244
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,710
看來別想讓他遠離世界了
So much for keeping him away from the world.

245
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,220
她什么樣
What's she like?

246
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,050
話癆
Bubbly.

247
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,100
你覺得他盯上她了嗎
And you think he's fixating on her?

248
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,850
他在畫她
He's drawing her.

249
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,560
新的模擬物怎么樣了
How's the new analogue?

250
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,860
我本來在糾結怎么讓它感覺更真實
I was struggling with how to make it feel more real

251
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
然后我想到了
when it occurred to me

252
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,030
她已經有背景故事了
she already has a backstory.

253
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,830
我可以給她看她此前生活的部分片段
I can show her select pieces of her previous life.

254
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,040
整理好的歷史
A curated history.

255
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,350
很有效
And it's working.

256
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,310
她看上去像人了
She seems human.

257
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,320
斯賓塞
Spencer!

258
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,360
真是好驚喜
What a nice surprise.

259
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,780
來還你的盤子的
Just came to return your plate.

260
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,340
好啊
Cool.

261
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,240
進來吧
Come on in.

262
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,500
來吧
Come on.

263
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,290
你喜歡餅干嗎
Did you like the cookies?

264
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,880
喜歡  挺好吃的
Yeah, they were-- they were good.

265
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,260
你拿了什么
What you got there?

266
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,760
就是給你的回禮
Uh, it's just a little something for you.

267
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,980
我畫的
I drew it.

268
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,780
你喜歡嗎
Do you like it?

269
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,780
喜歡
Yeah.

270
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,410
畫得太好了
This is amazing.

271
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,120
你說想要做些有創意的事  所以
You just said you wanted to do something creative. So...

272
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,970
嗯
Yeah.

273
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,580
我看出來了
Yeah, I totally see it.

274
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,260
太酷了
This is so cool.

275
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,090
謝謝
Thank you.

276
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,800
我都不知道你這么有才
I had no idea that you were so talented.

277
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,200
你應該為我設計一個紋身
You should design a tattoo for me.

278
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,660
我一直想紋一個
I've always wanted one.

279
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,890
我想紋在這里
I think I want to do it, like, right here.

280
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,150
這樣就能隨時藏起來
So I can hide it if I want to.

281
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,860
也許我會紋這個蝴蝶
Maybe I'll do that butterfly.

282
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,160
因為我總在改變
You know, 'cause I'm always changing.

283
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,990
蝴蝶只蛻變一次
A butterfly only changes once.

284
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,160
沒錯
Oh yeah.

285
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,710
你說得對
You're right.

286
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,250
我喜歡你
I like you.

287
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,010
你好奇怪
You're weird.

288
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,810
你去哪了
Where have you been?

289
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,730
你知道的
You know where.

290
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,320
瑪麗莎家
Marissa's.

291
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,840
我以為之前說清楚了
I thought I made myself clear.

292
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,760
你不能去見她
You are not to see her.

293
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,820
你想要我怎么樣
What do you want me to do?

294
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,380
你想要我正常點
You want me to act normal?

295
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,950
這就是我正常的樣子
This is-- this is me acting normal, okay?

296
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,200
我在交朋友
I'm makin' friends.

297
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,710
你不希望我出現在你眼前  又不想我出門
You don't want me around, you don't want me to go out.

298
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,230
我不是不希望你出現在我眼前
It's not that I don't want you around.

299
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,590
斯賓塞  我在她身上下的功夫都是為了你
Spencer, I'm doing all of this work on her for you!

300
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,090
你想見她嗎
Do you want to meet her?

301
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,390
好吧
Fine.

302
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,810
明天
Tomorrow.

303
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,980
我幫你準備一下她
Let me get her ready for you.

304
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,960
老天  這地方真不錯
Shit, this place is great.

305
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,130
你一個人住嗎
You, uh, live here alone?

306
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,000
不  我和我媽一起
No, I live here with my mom.

307
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,270
她在家嗎
Is she home?

308
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,340
不  她去工作了
No, she's at work.

309
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,220
是嗎
Yeah?

310
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
她是干什么的
What does she do?

311
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,720
基因學家
She's a geneticist.

312
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,680
你不能進去
Hey, you can't go in there.

313
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,970
這是她的實驗室
That's her lab.

314
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,310
好吧
Okay.

315
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,290
你認識之前和你在一起的那人嗎
Hey, you know that guy you were with?

316
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,190
認識
Yeah.

317
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,500
去他的
Fuck him.

318
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,730
他對我來說已經死了
He's fucking dead to me.

319
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,660
我能去廁所嗎  需要小便
Can I get a bathroom? Need to piss.

320
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,660
就在那邊
It's right over there.

321
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,850
我能來點嗎
Can I?

322
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,020
當然
Yeah, sure.

323
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,070
那么
So...

324
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,160
就我們倆了
We're alone.

325
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,460
你不來點嗎
Aren't you gonna join me?

326
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840
當然  我...
Yeah, I-- I...

327
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,140
我也來點
I can do that.

328
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,230
有什么
So is there, like...

329
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,330
你能聯系的人或什么的嗎
anybody you need to call or anything like that?

330
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,540
沒有
No.

331
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,790
我就需要到城鎮上就行
I just need to get to town.

332
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,610
任何城鎮都行
You know, any town, really.

333
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,120
等我媽回來了我能載你一程
But I can give you a ride when my mom gets back home.

334
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,830
你媽媽什么時候回來
When can we expect Mom?

335
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,180
大概再有幾個小時吧
Probably not for another hour or so.

336
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,750
我們該怎么打發這段時間
So how should we kill a few hours?

337
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,880
你有音樂嗎
Do you have any music?

338
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,050
直接說就行
Just ask.

339
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,430
播放寶貝們的歌
Play The Babys?

340
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,440
我喜歡這首歌
I... I love this song.

341
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,730
我奶奶以前
My grandma, she used to, uh--

342
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,320
以前經常放這歌
she used to play it all the time.

343
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,990
我覺得她想  我也說不好
I think she wanted to, I don't know,

344
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,870
想睡了樂隊的主唱吧
fuck the lead singer or something?

345
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,170
你的房間在這邊嗎
Is your room down here?

346
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,170
是的
Uh, yeah.

347
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,300
你還記得我提起過我兒子吧
You remember me mentioning my son, yes?

348
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,010
是他找到我的
He's the one who found me.

349
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,180
我覺得你倆該見見了
I think it's time the two of you met.

350
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,620
斯賓塞很害羞
Spencer is very shy.

351
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,040
能使他敞開心扉的
The best way to get him to open up

352
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,820
最好方法就是談談他喜歡的事物
is to talk to him about things he enjoys.

353
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,650
他喜歡什么
What does he like?

354
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,670
他喜歡藝術和音樂
He likes art and music.

355
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,910
喜歡紅酒和自然
He's fond of wine and nature.

356
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,000
告訴他你們愛好相同
Tell him you like the same things.

357
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,000
問問他畫的畫
Ask him about his art.

358
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,250
好的
Okay.

359
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,030
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

360
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,220
我挺好的
I'm fine.

361
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,850
我們去見他吧
Let's go meet him, shall we?

362
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,710
艾什莉  我想讓你見見我兒子斯賓塞
Ashley, I'd like to introduce you to my son Spencer.

363
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,260
你想喝點紅酒嗎
Would you like some wine?

364
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,100
樂意至極  謝謝
Yeah, I'd love some. Thank you.

365
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,360
我讓你倆好好熟悉熟悉吧
Well, I will leave the two of you to get better acquainted.

366
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:47,170
你媽媽說你喜歡藝術音樂之類的
Your mom told me that you like art and music and stuff like that?

367
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,950
是的
Yeah.

368
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,040
我也喜歡音樂
I like music too.

369
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,750
演奏我們的歌曲
Play our song.

370
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,490
這是你畫的嗎
Did you do this?

371
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,070
是的
I did.

372
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,610
很美
It's beautiful.

373
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,660
謝謝
Thank you.

374
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,330
你還有其他的作品嗎
Do you have more you could show me?

375
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,110
這些太棒了
These are great.

376
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,320
你認識我多久了
How long have you known me?

377
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,280
在你變成你之前
Since before you were even you.

378
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,440
你沒有寫
You're not writing.

379
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,810
怎么了
What is it?

380
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,570
每天早上我起來  感覺周圍一切都很假
Every morning I get up and everything seems fake.

381
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,200
我看到  摸到的一切都很...
It's like everything I see and everything I touch just...

382
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,080
感覺不真實
doesn't feel real.

383
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,460
彷佛我和世界之間隔著一層膜
Like there's a membrane between me and the rest of the world.

384
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,030
有時膜慢慢逼近
And sometimes that membrane closes in

385
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,680
我都無法呼吸
and I feel like I can't breathe.

386
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,060
就好像我被這種
Like I'm being smothered by this...

387
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,560
恐怖無形的虛空扼住了喉嚨
horrible invisible nothingness.

388
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,820
但今天我覺得自己能呼吸了
But today I felt like I could breathe.

389
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,250
我已經很久沒感覺這么好
And I haven't felt this good,

390
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,250
這么自由  自從...
this free, since...

391
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,790
這是頭一回
well, the first time.

392
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,930
我...
Well, I...

393
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,970
我不想寫下來
I didn't want to write that down.

394
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,230
我想告訴你
I wanted to tell you.

395
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,940
你知道我有多感激
You know how thankful I am.

396
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,370
他真的抱了你
He actually hugged you?

397
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,520
身體接觸
Real physical contact?

398
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,250
他已經很多年沒擁抱我了
It's been years since he's done that.

399
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,850
奏效了
It's working.

400
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,060
這個突破可能帶來
This breakthrough could lead to

401
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,400
一種全新的行為矯正法
an entirely new kind of behavior modification therapy.

402
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,650
而應用將會
The applications could be--

403
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,980
你的公司花費了數年
The years it took your company

404
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,780
才批準了一個克隆器官的移植項目
to gain approval simply to clone organs for transplant.

405
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,410
-我知道  -原教旨主義者已經
- I know. - Fundamentalists still want

406
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,410
想為此把你燒了
to burn you at the stake for that.

407
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,530
我很清楚還沒有人準備好
I'm well aware that nobody is ready to debate

408
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,620
為人類克隆的合法性和倫理性辯護
the legalities and ethics of human cloning,

409
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,270
但這效果太好了
but the effects!

410
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,110
那現在怎么辦
So what now?

411
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,360
先等一段時間
Now, we let some time pass,

412
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,130
看這個良效能持續多久
see how long the positive effects last,

413
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,630
然后再做一次  做得更好
then do it again, better.

414
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,220
他們相處的時間越愉快
The more satisfying the event,

415
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,490
就能持續地更久  然后
the more time can pass between them, and then...

416
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,560
也許他能搬出去
maybe he can move out.

417
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,960
去念大學
Go to college.

418
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,460
擁有自己的生活
Have a life.

419
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,970
等他癮復發時再回來
Return home whenever he needs his fix.

420
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,950
你好  斯賓塞
Heya, Spence.

421
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,250
瑪麗莎
Marissa.

422
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,210
你在慢跑
You're jogging.

423
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,750
是啊  我討厭慢跑
Yeah, I hate it.

424
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,130
那你為什么跑
Then why do you do it?

425
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,940
因為在這無事可做
'Cause there's nothing else to do out here

426
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,010
所以我想保持下體型
so I figured I might as well get in shape.

427
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,300
你怎么能受得了
How do you stand it?

428
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,930
受得了什么
Stand what?

429
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,140
這種安靜
The quiet.

430
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,400
我喜歡安靜
I like it.

431
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,810
能讓我思考
Lets me think.

432
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,650
我思考得太多
I think too much.

433
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,730
我總是沉浸在自己的想法里
I'm always in my head and...

434
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,740
過度分析
overanalyzing and...

435
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,860
我的心理醫生以前常這么說
That's what my therapist used to say.

436
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,930
你去看心理醫生嗎
You see a therapist?

437
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,490
是啊  現在人人都去
Yeah, doesn't everybody?

438
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,180
那你  那你都說些什么
What do you-- what do you talk about?

439
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,790
就是  你為什么去看心理醫生
Like, what do you-- what do you see her for?

440
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,840
我以前有飲食紊亂癥
I had an eating disorder.

441
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,550
無法接受自己的身體什么的
Poor body image, stuff like that.

442
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,890
我以前覺得自己
I used to think that I was, like,

443
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,240
活得很糟糕而且很古怪
like, really messed up and weird,

444
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,780
但我去了學校
but then I went to school

445
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,120
發現所有人都有嚴重的毒癮
and everybody there has, like, a crazy drug problem,

446
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,020
我就覺得自己其實還挺正常
so I was like, "I'm actually-- I'm okay."

447
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,610
然后我就不去了
And I just stopped going.

448
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,030
我也是
Yeah, me too.

449
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,750
你也有飲食紊亂癥
You had an eating disorder too?

450
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,490
不是  我不再去見心理醫生了
No, I--I stopped going to therapy.

451
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,040
你受了什么創傷
What's your damage?

452
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,140
斯賓塞  抱歉  你無需
Spence, I'm sorry, you don't--

453
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,610
不  對不起  我不是故意
No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

454
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,780
不不  是我的錯
No, no, no, no, it's my fault.

455
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,180
我不該打探
I shouldn't have pried.

456
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,400
其實  我想問你些事情
I actually-- um, I wanted to ask you something.

457
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,520
我正四處找事做  因為太無聊
I was looking for things to do because, you know, bored,

458
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,860
城里的畫廊有一場新的展覽
and, uh, the gallery in town has a new exhibit coming, and...

459
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,720
我想既然你是位出色的藝術家
I thought that since you're such an amazing artist,

460
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,450
也許你想去看看
that maybe you would wanna go.

461
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,120
你懂的
You know,

462
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,120
和我一起
with me.

463
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,130
考慮下吧
Think about it.

464
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,380
告訴我你的決定
Let me know how you feel.

465
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,300
拜拜
Okay, bye.

466
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,580
這些真的很酷  哥們
These are really cool, dude.

467
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,870
你畫的嗎
Did you do these?

468
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,790
是的  是我畫的
Yeah, those are mine.

469
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,500
我喜歡藝術
I love art.

470
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,620
看
See?

471
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,750
烏洛波洛斯
Ouroboros.

472
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,420
什么
What?

473
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,050
這是它的名字
That's what it's called.

474
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,840
真的嗎
Really?

475
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,670
酷
Cool.

476
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,850
不  我不會跳舞
No, I-- I don't dance.

477
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,230
你當然會
Oh, sure you do.

478
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,860
你不經常帶女孩來這  是吧
You don't bring a lot of girls up here, do you?

479
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,160
你是第一個
You're the first.

480
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,620
我覺得自己從沒成為過誰的第一個
I don't think I've been anyone's first anything before.

481
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,670
放松  小子
Easy, tiger.

482
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,460
別太激動了
Don't wanna get too worked up.

483
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,010
不
No!

484
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,300
操
Fuck!

485
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,430
該死
Fuck.

486
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,600
放開我
Let go of me!

487
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,980
我們這次要耐心點  好嗎
We're going to be patient again, right?

488
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,070
好的
Right.

489
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,650
好的
Right.

490
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,950
我想讓她對你來說更真實
I want her to be real for you,

491
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,130
更像是真的人
to feel like the real thing

492
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,910
延遲你
so you can go longer

493
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,710
沖動爆發的時間
before feeling these urges.

494
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,080
我知道
I know.

495
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,340
-是嗎  -我知道  媽媽
- Do you? - I know, Mom.

496
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,260
我明白  我知道我們在做什么
I get it, I understand what we're doing here.

497
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,260
謝謝
Thank you.

498
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,020
早上好
Good morning.

499
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,400
你今天感覺怎么樣
How are you feeling today?

500
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,370
如果你感到暈頭轉向  這是正常的
It's okay if you're feeling disoriented.

501
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,160
你經歷了許多事
You've been through a lot.

502
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,540
我在哪里
Where am I?

503
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,920
你出了一場意外
You had an accident,

504
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,940
但我把你修好了
but I patched you up,

505
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,460
你現在應該和新的一樣了
and you should be as good as new.

506
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,010
我叫維多利亞
My name is Victoria.

507
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,590
我是基因學家  但我也是結構工程師
I'm a geneticist, but I'm also an MD.

508
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,640
我叫什么
What's my name?

509
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,650
艾什莉
Ashley.

510
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,480
艾什莉
Ashley.

511
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,190
你餓嗎
Are you hungry?

512
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,570
我給你做了點湯
I made you some soup.

513
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,460
我什么時候能回家
When can I go home?

514
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,670
你記得你的家在哪里嗎
Do you remember where your home is?

515
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,970
別擔心
Don't worry,

516
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,200
你的記憶會恢復的
your memories will come back,

517
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,680
只要一恢復
and just as soon as they do,

518
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:44,270
你就可以回家了  好嗎
you can go home, okay?

519
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,020
好的
Okay.

520
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,730
吃得應該差不多了
Well, that's probably enough for now, hmm?

521
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,820
你先休息一下
Why don't you get some more rest,

522
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,910
我們等會兒再聊
and we can talk more later.

523
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,490
好吧
Okay.

524
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,370
維多利亞
Victoria.

525
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,540
怎么了
Yes?

526
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:04,750
謝謝
Thank you.

527
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,250
不客氣  艾什莉
You're very welcome, Ashley.

528
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,190
給你
Here.

529
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,500
你給我買了條狗嗎
You got me a dog?

530
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,400
謝謝  媽媽  我愛你
Thanks, Mom, I love you.

531
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,210
我也愛你  寶貝
Oh, I love you too, sweetie.

532
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,190
這是誰
Who is that?

533
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,570
這是我兒子  斯賓塞
That's my son, Spencer.

534
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,380
他當時七歲
He was seven years old there.

535
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,620
他現在已經長大了
He's grown up now.

536
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,050
他在和他的第一條狗  馬克斯玩
Here, he's playing with our first dog, Max.

537
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,210
你有狗嗎
You have a dog?

538
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,620
在哪里
Where is he?

539
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,510
它在這里
He's right here.

540
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,800
{\an8}馬克斯

541
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,260
馬克斯死了
Max died.

542
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,510
發生了什么
What happened?

543
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,470
它出了場意外
He had an accident.

544
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,900
它傷得很重
He was hurt very badly,

545
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:14,020
但它很想活著
but he really wanted to live,

546
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,360
它掙扎了一個星期才去世
and he fought hard for a week before he passed away.

547
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,030
我們把它埋在了這里
We buried him here.

548
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,490
{\an8}幸運

549
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,250
幸運也死了嗎
Lucky died too?

550
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,420
萬物都會死
Everything dies.

551
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,210
總有一天  我也會死
One day I'll die.

552
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,010
你也會死
You'll die.

553
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,900
然后呢  會發生什么
And then what, what happens?

554
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,760
沒什么
Nothing.

555
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,970
總有一天  你的心臟會停止跳動
One day, your heart will stop beating,

556
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,450
你的大腦得不到
your brain will no longer get the oxygen that it needs

557
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,480
維持工作所需要的氧氣
to continue functioning, and...

558
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:55,820
你身體里的所有東西都會消失
everything that made you you will be gone.

559
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,000
你所有的記憶  經歷
All your memories, experiences,

560
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,570
將和你一起死去
will die with you.

561
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,740
為什么
Why?

562
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,700
萬事就是這樣
It's simply the way things are.

563
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,830
馬克斯很清楚
Max knew that.

564
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,040
他為了存活在這個世上而努力掙扎
He fought so hard to stay alive.

565
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,920
每一口呼吸
Every breath

566
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,630
都是珍貴的
is precious.

567
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,130
每場死亡都是悲劇
Every death a tragedy.

568
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,580
誰在和你在一起
Who's here with you?

569
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,560
我以為你變好了
I thought you were better.

570
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,980
你為什么不跟我說說
Why couldn't you talk to me about this?

571
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,690
你為什么對我撒謊
Why did you lie to me?

572
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,360
我不...
I didn't--

573
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,030
我不想讓你恨我
I didn't want you to hate me.

574
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,300
她從哪里來的
Where did she come from?

575
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,080
她被困在了路邊
She was just stranded on the side of the road.

576
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,290
該死  斯賓塞
Damn it, Spencer.

577
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,710
抱歉
I'm sorry.

578
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,510
我們得讓她消失
We have to make this go away.

579
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,100
怎么弄
How?

580
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:50,390
我不知道
I don't know.

581
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,030
你什么意思  我們該做什么
What do you mean, what are we supposed to do?

582
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,690
讓我想想
Just-- just... let me think.

583
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,330
沒人知道她在這里嗎
Nobody knows that she's here?

584
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,940
沒有  沒有
No, no.

585
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,860
好吧
Okay.

586
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,200
好
Okay.

587
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,370
我可以去實驗室
I can go to the lab,

588
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:15,410
取一個裝滿吡哆醇的還原罐
get a reduction tank full of pyridoxine,

589
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,880
把她完全分解了
break her down to raw materials.

590
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,010
不會留下任何可以識別的蹤跡
There won't be anything recognizable left.

591
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,780
我以為你會喜歡
I thought you'd like this.

592
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:58,250
穿上吧
Oh, here.

593
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,840
真貼心  謝謝你
That's so sweet, thank you.

594
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,170
我其實應該謝謝你
I should be thanking you actually.

595
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,510
我之前從沒親眼看過藝術品
I've never seen real art in person before.

596
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,220
你在開玩笑嗎
Are you joking?

597
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,640
沒有
No.

598
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,610
我只是難以相信
That's just so hard for me to believe.

599
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,140
你是個很棒的藝術家
You're such an amazing artist.

600
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,890
你真的可以開自己的畫展
You could seriously have your own gallery show.

601
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,000
我不知道  我只看過
I don't know, I've seen virtual tours

602
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,040
羅浮宮和古根海姆博物館的虛擬游
of the Louvre and Guggenheim,

603
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,280
但僅此而已
but that's about it.

604
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,960
真的嗎  你的班級旅行
Really, you never took a class trip

605
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,740
從來沒去過博物館之類的嗎
to a museum or anything?

606
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,420
我只上到了小學六年級  所以...
I was only in school till sixth grade, so...

607
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,780
為什么
Why?

608
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,830
自此之后  我媽都在家里教我
Mom home-schooled me after that

609
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,580
然后我們搬到了這里
and moved us out here,

610
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,210
一直把我關在家里
kept me on a leash.

611
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,460
大家都說這樣最好
Everyone said it was for the best.

612
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,960
他們為什么這么說
Why would they say that?

613
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,720
我在課間做了一些錯事
I did something wrong at recess.

614
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,490
我們當時都在攀爬架上玩"山中之王"
We were all playing King of the Mountain on the jungle gym,

615
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,520
你記得那游戲嗎
you remember that game?

616
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,810
記得
Yeah.

617
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,990
我一般不會經常和其他孩子們玩
I didn't really play with the other kids that much.

618
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,020
并不是他們...
It's not that they--

619
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,040
他們不想讓我玩  或是怎么樣
they didn't want me to or anything like that.

620
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,080
只是我不想玩
It's just I didn't feel like it.

621
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,530
我總是看書或是在書上畫畫
You know, I'd always read or draw in my books.

622
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,800
但當時我覺得那個游戲我好像也可以玩
But I don't know, it seemed like a game that I could get into.

623
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,240
因為很簡單
You know, it's simple.

624
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,540
它不需要團隊協作
It didn't require any team effort

625
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,010
或是依賴其他人
or dependency on other people.

626
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,370
你只需要爬到頂上  你就是"王"了
You just... climb to the top and you're king, and...

627
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,460
我想當"王"
I wanted to be king.

628
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,960
所以我爬到了攀爬架的頂上
So I climbed to the top of the jungle gym, and...

629
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,050
特蕾西·海因茨就在我的后面
That's when Tracey Heinz got up behind me, and...

630
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,110
我知道這么做不對  但出于某種原因
I knew it was wrong, but for some reason,

631
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,180
那并不重要
that didn't matter.

632
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:40,850
時間好像靜止了一樣
It was like time stopped.

633
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,560
這一瞬間...
I was given this moment to...

634
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,110
我能自己做決定
make a decision all on my own, and...

635
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,610
我是唯一掌控一切的人
I was the only one in control.

636
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,820
所以我用力推了她
So I shoved her, hard.

637
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,530
她摔下去了
She fell.

638
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,540
幾天之后她死了  他們就
She died a couple days later, and they just

639
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,040
不讓我回學校了
didn't let me go back to school, so.

640
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:07,500
天哪  你當時只是個孩子
God, you were just a kid.

641
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:12,800
從那之后你就遠離你的同齡人嗎
And you've been away from people your own age ever since?

642
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,220
我媽說這樣最好
My mom said it was for the best, so.

643
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,390
過來  我想給你看點東西
Come here, I want to show you something.

644
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,480
驚喜
Surprise!

645
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,800
這家畫廊的老板是我朋友的朋友
The gallery owner is a friend of my folks,

646
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,820
我給他看的時候  他嚇了一跳  斯賓塞
and he freaked out when I showed it to him, Spence.

647
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,630
他說如果你有更多的作品
He said that if you have more like this,

648
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,580
你可以辦自己的畫展了
then you can have your own show.

649
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:45,870
斯賓塞
Spencer!

650
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,100
我沒有送給他
I didn't give it away to him,

651
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,540
這不是拿來賣的
and it's not for sale.

652
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,100
我永遠不會把它送人的
I would never give this piece away.

653
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,590
我沒讓你這么做
I didn't ask you to do this.

654
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,590
我不明白在你這么做之前
I-I don't understand why you'd do this

655
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,150
為什么不問問我
without asking me.

656
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,760
為了給你個驚喜
To surprise you.

657
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,160
斯賓塞  你是個藝術家
Spencer, you're an artist.

658
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,020
你屬于這里
You belong here.

659
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,650
我只是想讓你看到這點
I just wanted you to see that.

660
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,150
我為你驕傲
I'm proud of you.

661
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,460
斯賓塞  你還沒睡嗎
Spencer, you still up?

662
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,290
斯賓塞
Spencer?

663
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,230
{\an8}你想定位誰
斯賓塞

664
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,150
{\an8}正在定位斯賓塞

665
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,370
{\an8}媽媽
手機已定位

666
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,580
我決定了
I've decided something.

667
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,250
你要跟我多出去玩幾次
You are going out more, with me.

668
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,250
我強迫你去
I'm gonna force you.

669
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,690
因為你被關在那房子里太久了
Because you've been cooped up in that house for way too long,

670
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,760
而你需要多體驗世界
and you need to have more experiences.

671
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,300
你知道的
And, you know,

672
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,300
我需要干點事情
I need things to do.

673
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,700
很高興我能緩解你的無聊
Well, I'm glad I can assuage your boredom.

674
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,320
不是  不是這個
No, stop it, no, it's not just that.

675
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,180
我覺得你真的很棒
I think that you're really cool.

676
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,060
以前從來沒人這么說過
No one's ever called me that before.

677
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,070
晚安
Good night.

678
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,610
你去哪兒了
Where have you been?

679
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,330
我們在美術館里  媽媽
We were at an art gallery, Mom.

680
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,960
我還要跟你說幾遍...
How many times do I have to tell you--

681
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,630
我現在不能有朋友嗎
I can't have friends now?

682
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:22,820
不  你不能
No, you can't.

683
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,120
你能嗎
Can you?

684
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:32,040
斯賓塞
Spencer,

685
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,540
我是唯一一個
I am the only one

686
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,650
曾經在你身邊
who has ever been there for you,

687
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:41,840
以及一直都會在你身邊的人
who will always be there for you.

688
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,680
沒人會像我這樣照顧你
No one will take care of you the way that I do.

689
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,770
你真的想為了她而毀掉
Do you really want to throw all that away...

690
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,690
這一切嗎
for her?

691
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,570
和她在一起感覺不一樣
It just feels different with her.

692
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,650
艾什莉
Ashley?

693
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,160
艾什莉
Ashley?

694
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,470
你在外面干什么
What are you doing out here?

695
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,010
我睡不著
I couldn't sleep.

696
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,390
我做了噩夢
I had bad dreams.

697
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,680
真的嗎
Really?

698
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,520
夢到什么了
What about?

699
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,730
我無法呼吸
I couldn't breathe.

700
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,830
就像溺水似的嗎
Like you were drowning?

701
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:22,940
不  我...
No, I, um,

702
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,250
我不在水下  只是無法呼吸
I wasn't underwater, I just-- I couldn't breathe,

703
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,910
有雙手...
and then there were hands, and...

704
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,700
有人和你在一起嗎
Was someone with you?

705
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,710
我不記得了
I don't remember,

706
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,500
但我在另一間臥室
but I was in a different bedroom, and...

707
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:44,520
我無法呼吸  非常疼痛
I couldn't breathe, and then everything hurt,

708
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,590
然后我就暈過去了
and-- and then it just went black.

709
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,090
只是個夢而已
It's just a dream.

710
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,180
你兒子為什么躲著我們
Why is your son hiding from us?

711
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,270
斯賓塞
Spencer?

712
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,360
他只是很害羞
He's just very shy.

713
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,030
在意外之后
He was the one who found you

714
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,990
是他找到了你
after the accident.

715
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,530
是他照顧了你
He was the one who took care of you.

716
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,120
我不記得了
I-- I don't remember any of that.

717
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,990
你身上肯定發生了什么事
Something must have happened to you.

718
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,000
你當時很混亂  很冷
You were... confused and cold.

719
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,380
你不記得了嗎
You don't remember any of that?

720
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,380
不記得了
No.

721
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,380
我什么時候才能好起來
When am I gonna get better?

722
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,690
我在這里做的所有事
Everything I'm doing here

723
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,850
都是為了幫助你恢復
is to help you recover your past.

724
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,430
你只需要耐心一點
You just have to be patient.

725
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,390
需要多久
For how long?

726
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,870
你不能管這叫記憶
You can't call it a memory.

727
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,150
這是場夢
It was a dream.

728
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,130
一個無法呼吸的夢
A dream about not being able to breathe.

729
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,860
她說她就在那個
She said she was in his room

730
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,210
他把她掐死一次又一次的房間里
right where he has choked her to death

731
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,510
她無法呼吸
over and over again, and she couldn't breathe.

732
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,090
-別這樣  小維  -要是你能親眼
- Come on, Vic. - If you were there,

733
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,500
看看她的眼神  她很害怕
if you had seen her eyes, she was so afraid.

734
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,720
我知道她想起來了之前的肉身
I know she is remembering a previous incarnation.

735
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,730
你對模擬物投入的感情太深了
You're growing too attached to the analogue.

736
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,520
它不是模擬物  它是艾什莉
It's not an analogue, it's Ashley.

737
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,520
我跟你說
I'm telling you.

738
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,360
她要想起來她是誰了
She's remembering who she was.

739
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,300
-怎么想  -我不知道
- How? - I don't know!

740
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,900
也許還原過程有凈化作用
Maybe there's something purifying in the reduction process.

741
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,700
也許記憶編碼在她的DNA中
Maybe memory is encoded in her DNA.

742
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,240
也許上帝因為我們殺人
Maybe God is punishing us

743
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,330
而懲罰我們  創造了這個怪物
for taking a life and creating this abomination.

744
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,910
我不知道  我不知道事情會發展成什么樣
I don't know, I don't know how this can be.

745
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,160
沒有對照組
There's no control group,

746
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,330
沒有先例
there's no precedent for this.

747
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,190
我只知道
All I know is...

748
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,740
她不僅只是一個復制體
she is more than just a copy.

749
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,990
她對你來說更像是真人
She's more real to you?

750
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,050
是的
Yes.

751
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,840
你愿意將她
And you're okay with giving her--

752
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,660
將艾什莉給他
with giving Ashley to him?

753
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,620
我愿意為我的兒子做一切
I would do anything for my son.

754
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,920
你是暗指我不會嗎
You're implying that I wouldn't?

755
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,250
畢竟你根本不在這里  對嗎
Well, you're not here, are you?

756
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:48,550
我無法在那里
I can't be there.

757
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:50,720
你知道的
You know that.

758
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,030
沒關系
It's all right,

759
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,220
反正他從來就不需要他的父親
he's never really needed his father anyway.

760
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:20,030
艾什莉  我給你做了點午餐...
Ashley, I made you some lunch if--

761
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,120
你沒事吧
Are you all right?

762
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,200
沒事
Fine.

763
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,660
我沒事
I'm fine.

764
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:26,790
我只是
I just...

765
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:28,660
又做了一個夢
had another dream.

766
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,000
別擔心  噩夢傷不了你
Don't worry, dreams can't hurt you.

767
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,170
你可以好好休息
You can rest all you like.

768
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,760
我待會兒再來看你
I'll come check on you later.

769
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,270
好嗎
Okay?

770
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,890
好  謝謝你
Great, thank you.

771
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,530
她在嗎
Is she around?

772
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,290
她在她的房間里
She's in her room.

773
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,050
我們能談談嗎
Can we talk for a second?

774
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:24,680
關閉音樂
Music off.

775
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,900
好的
Okay.

776
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,520
我覺得我不想再這樣下去了
I don't think I wanna do this anymore.

777
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,530
怎樣
What exactly?

778
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:42,130
這一切  她
Just this, her,

779
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,780
這所有的...所有的一切
just the whole-- the whole thing.

780
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,830
你想和我說什么
What are you trying to tell me?

781
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,000
我只想做個正常人  我想和其他人一樣
I just want to be normal, I want to be like everybody else

782
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,600
我想擁有普通的人生
and I wanna have a normal life.

783
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,520
我想去交朋友  和他們一起玩
I wanna go make friends and hang out with them.

784
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,670
斯賓塞
Spencer.

785
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,420
你做不到
You can't.

786
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,270
為什么
Why not?

787
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,840
你都看過了多少醫生
How many doctors have you seen?

788
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,010
你的冷漠
The detachment,

789
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,320
虐待動物
the animal cruelty,

790
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,470
操場意外
the playground.

791
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,580
這不是一天兩天的事了  也不會就此結束
This didn't just start, and it won't just end.

792
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,350
但是為什么不行呢  我...
Okay, but why not? Like, I--

793
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,540
這不就是你一直希望我做到的嗎
Isn't this what you want for me?

794
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,670
你就不能至少信任我一次  讓我試試嗎
Can't you at least trust me enough to go try?

795
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:22,070
你難道想...和這個女孩離開嗎
What, do you want to... run away with this girl?

796
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,240
我喜歡她
I like her.

797
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,950
你會殺死她的
You'll kill her.

798
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,610
我什么時候能見斯賓塞
When am I gonna meet Spencer?

799
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,670
快了  很快了
Soon. Very soon.

800
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,870
是他救了我  對嗎
He's the one who saved me, right?

801
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,160
那他為什么怕見我
Why is he afraid to see me?

802
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,370
他不是害怕
Oh, he's not afraid.

803
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,470
斯賓塞只是...
Spencer is just--

804
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,330
害羞嗎
Shy?

805
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:20,920
你說過了
Yeah, you said that.

806
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,760
我見過他和另一個女孩一起
I saw him with another girl.

807
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:26,680
他看上去
He doesn't, um,

808
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,260
他看上去好像并不害羞
he doesn't seem that shy.

809
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,220
是嗎
Is that so?

810
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:53,950
她是誰
Who is she?

811
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,660
另一個女孩
The other girl.

812
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,290
沒誰
Nobody.

813
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,750
只是一個鄰居
Just a neighbor.

814
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,600
我保證
I assure you,

815
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,800
斯賓塞嘴里說的全是你
all Spencer does is talk about you.

816
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,760
等你記起了你是誰  你就明白了
You'll understand when you remember who you are.

817
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,720
是他幫助了你
He's the one who helped you.

818
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:15,220
那我們應該見一見
Then we should meet.

819
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,140
我想謝謝他
I-I wanna thank him.

820
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,610
什么聲音
What was that?

821
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,240
我不知道
I don't know.

822
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:47,340
什么東西
What was it?

823
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,120
{\an8}呼入  泰勒

824
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,910
這個會議一個月前就安排好了
This meeting has been on the books for over a month.

825
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,920
如果你今天不來  董事會會很...
If you don't come in today, the board is seriously--

826
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,050
這個大樓都是以我命名的
My name is on the building.

827
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,140
我肯定能有一些個人空間吧
Surely that gives me a little leeway here.

828
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,510
董事會的人已經到齊了  都在等你
The board is assembled and waiting for you.

829
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,560
-看上去情況不妙  -我的克隆組織
- It doesn't look good. - My cloned organs

830
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,590
將會給移植市場帶來巨大的變革
are going to revolutionize the transplant market

831
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,560
為哈里斯基因帶來巨大的財富
and make Harris Genetics wealthy beyond imagining.

832
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,980
你自己來和他們說
Come tell them that.

833
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,050
他們想當面和你談
They want to see you face-to-face,

834
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:34,110
也許你能和我們說說你在你的家庭實驗室里
and maybe you could give us a hint of what you're working on

835
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:36,280
都在做些什么  接下來我們...
in that home lab of yours, the next big thing we--

836
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,660
不  還不行
No, not yet.

837
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,120
趕緊過來
Come in, now.

838
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,370
和董事會聊聊
Talk to the board.

839
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,250
向他們保證我們公司的門面代表
Reassure them that the face of our company

840
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:45,400
會確保新產品的發布
will be there for the new product launches.

841
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,440
我馬上來
I'm on my way.

842
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,540
{\an8}結束通話

843
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,530
操
Fuck!

844
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,180
媽媽  你看到我的素描本了嗎
Mom, have you seen my sketchbook?

845
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,100
別離開家  我要出去一趟
Don't leave the house, I need to go out.

846
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:07,980
-去哪里  -這不重要
- Where? - It doesn't matter.

847
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,550
在我回來之前  我會把艾什莉鎖在她的房間里
I'm locking Ashley in her room until I get back.

848
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:11,590
為什么
Why?

849
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,510
因為我不信任你單獨和她一起
Because I can't trust you alone with her.

850
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,290
我要去處理一些事
I need you to stay put for a few hours

851
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:24,690
你乖乖在這里待著
while I deal with something.

852
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,010
{\an8}通緝
如果你看到此人  請聯系我們

853
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,110
上帝啊  斯賓塞
Jesus Christ, Spencer,

854
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,220
你和這女孩在一起做什么
what the hell are you doing with this girl?

855
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:11,490
{\an8}哈里斯基因

856
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,410
我已經盡量為你掩護了
I've been covering for you the best I can,

857
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,370
但是董事會關注的不僅僅是這個項目  還有你
but the board didn't just back this project, they backed you.

858
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:25,620
我知道  很抱歉我離開了這么久
I know, I'm sorry I've been gone.

859
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:38,810
{\an8}瑪麗莎·康奈爾

01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,980
很好  那你去和他們說
Great, now go tell them.

864
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,910
{\an8}信息監控
信息來自  瑪麗莎·康奈爾
你家里的這個女孩子有故事

865
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,880
能不能稍等我一下
May I have just a moment?

866
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,530
-他們在等你  -就一會...
- They're waiting for you. - Just one quick--

867
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,600
你和她說了什么
What did you tell her?

868
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,750
我什么都沒和她說
I didn't tell her anything.

869
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,170
我和你說了她是個麻煩  你就是不聽我的
I told you she was trouble, you just wouldn't listen to me.

870
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,010
我知道
I know.

871
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,470
我馬上回家
I'm coming right home.

872
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,680
我們不能再讓他們繼續等著了
We can't keep them waiting any longer.

873
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:20,800
對不起

你沒有回我信息
You didn't answer my text.

878
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,690
斯賓塞  我知道有人和你一起住在這里

我跟你說了不要去接近她

我們得找到她
Well, we have to find her.

It's okay, I'll take the heat.

941
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,270
我們就說都是我一個人干的
All right, we'll just say it was all me

942
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:12,010
這一切和你都沒有關系
and you had nothing to do with any of this.

947
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,460
然后我們去找艾什莉
and then we will find Ashley.

948
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,320
她根本不熟悉這個地方
She doesn't know where she is.

949
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,930
她跑不了多遠

一個影子
a shadow.

954
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:12,370

958
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,720
-是我創造了你  -你不是我的母親
- I made you. - You aren't my mother.

你看到你自己是一名罪犯了嗎
Did you read the part about being a criminal?

964
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:34,940
如果我兒子沒有帶你來
If my son hadn't taken you in,

965
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:38,730
你就會在監獄中腐爛  而不是...
you would be rotting in a cage instead--

966
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:39,760
而不是什么
Instead of what?

967
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,060
他殺了我多少次
How many times has he killed me?

968
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,310
你真的記了起來
You do remember.

969
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,370
我記得有手
I remember hands

970
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,120
還有窒息  還有他的臉
and choking and his face,

971
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,190
他變態的笑容
his sick fucking smile.

972
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,050
你們倆都是禽獸
You are monsters, both of you.

973
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,030
等等
Wait.

974
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,670
你是一個奇跡  你知道嗎
You're a miracle, do you know that?

975
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,130
你是這個世界上
You are the rarest thing

976
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:21,380
最珍貴的東西
on this earth.

977
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,720
獨一無二
Completely one-of-a-kind.

978
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,560
你不知道你有多么特別
You have no idea how special you are.

979
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:32,690
媽媽
Mom!

980
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:00,630
艾什莉
Ashley!

981
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,430
艾什莉
Ashley!

982
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,690
艾什莉
Ashley!

983
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:41,050
艾什莉  住手
Ashley, stop.

984
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:27,570
你要知道結局只能是這樣的  對嗎
You had to know it had to end this way, right?

985
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,410
你做了你力所能及能保護他的一切
You did everything you could to protect him.

986
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,720
他一開始就是破碎的
He was broken from the beginning.

987
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,120
我只是希望你能像我一樣明白
I just wish you could've seen it as clearly as I did.

988
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,710
你需要放下
You need to put it to rest.

989
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,880
放下他吧  維多利亞
Let him go, Victoria.

990
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,840
就像你當初一樣嗎
Like you did?

991
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,770
我受夠了
I'm done with this.

992
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:48,800
我要取出我的遣散費  賣掉房子
I'm taking my severance, selling the house.

993
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,230
你不會再聯系到我了
You'll never hear from me again.

994
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,640
別這樣  別...
Don't do this, don't--

995
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,540
你給我買了條狗嗎
You got me a dog?

996
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,850
謝謝  媽媽  我愛你
Thanks, Mom, I love you.

997
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:21,920
我也愛你  寶貝
Oh, I love you too, sweetie.
