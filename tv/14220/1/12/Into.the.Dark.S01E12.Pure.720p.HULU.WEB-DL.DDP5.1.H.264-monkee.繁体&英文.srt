她真是對你過敏
She is literally allergic to you.

20
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,390

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,540

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,690
交出來
Hand them over.

28
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,280
叛徒
Traitor.

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,490
別找麻煩  喬

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,110
凱爾  我的朋友  見到你真高興
Kyle, my friend, it is good to see you.

31
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,530
見到你很高興  牧師
Good to see you, Pastor.

32
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,720
-你還好嗎  -很好  先生
- How you doing, my man? - Oh, very good, sir.

33
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,590
女士們  容我來做迎賓隊
Ladies, allow me to be your welcoming committee.

34
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,950
{\an8}女兒節快樂

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,870
喬  看看你  長這么大了
Jo, look at you, all grown up.

36
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,940
這是第幾次了
How many is this now?

37
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,330
第五次
Number five.

38
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,110
老天爺啊  這是誰
Praise the Lord. And who is this?

39
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,730
這是謝伊
This is Shay.

40
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,530
我的另一個女兒
My other daughter.

41
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,550
很高興你能來  謝伊
Well, it is wonderful to have you, Shay.

42
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,840
我是賽斯牧師
I am Pastor Seth.

43
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,240
認識你很高興
Nice to meet you.

44
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,490
謝伊是第一次來
This is Shay's first time,

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,510
她來的途中還有點暈車
and she got a little carsick on the way up.

46
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,930
沒事的
Listen, don't worry,

47
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,410
我們會教你怎么做
we will tell you what to do.

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,420
但我有個問題  你祈禱嗎  謝伊
But I do have a question: Do you pray, Shay?

49
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,800
沒怎么祈禱過
I haven't much.

50
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,800
沒事
Well, that's okay.

51
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,020
喬肯定能教你
I'm sure that Jo can help show you how.

52
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,980
是啊  我的確
Yes, I have been known

53
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,690
時不時會采取跪姿
to get on my knees every now and then.

54
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,850
-喬  -為了祈禱
- Jo. - To pray.

55
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,910
你來這里很勇敢  謝伊
You are very brave, Shay, for being here.

56
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,790
這條路可不好走
This is not an easy path to walk in.

57
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,120
很多人一路上磕磕絆絆
Many have stumbled along the way,

58
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,230
但別擔心
but do not worry.

59
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,860
我們不會讓你摔倒的
We will not let you fall.

60
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,570
現在上帝會照顧你了
You're in God's hands now.

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,820
謝謝
Thank you.

62
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,720
謝伊
Shay!

63
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,430
快點
Hurry up.

64
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,430
喬  你到了
Jo, you're here!

65
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,790
對  永遠的4號小屋
Yeah, cabin 4 for life.

66
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,890
我爸爸好慌
My dad's freaking out.

67
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,680
他每年都緊張得要死
Literally every year, he's a nervous wreck

68
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,710
直到我們到這里
until we get up here.

69
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,550
喬
Hi, Jo.

70
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,970
我是萊西
Hi, I'm Lacey.

71
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
凱利安
KellyAnn.

72
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,890
伙計們  這是謝伊
Guys, this is Shay.

73
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,890
我們是姐妹
We're sisters.

74
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,660
你覺得牧師會講話嗎
Do you think the pastor will do the speech?

75
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,080
可能吧
Probably.

76
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,450
什么講話
What speech?

77
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,750
莉莉絲
Lilith.

78
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,390
喬很喜歡莉莉絲的講話
Jo loves the Lilith speech.

79
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,500
我覺得你可能沒聽懂
I feel like you might be missing the point.

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,460
你是不該喜歡那個故事的
You're not supposed to love that story.

81
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,510
拜托告訴我你周日不會戴那個面紗
Please tell me you're not gonna wear that veil on Sunday.

82
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,650
跟裙子一起的
Came with the dress.

83
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,050
不  絕對不要
No! Definitely no.

84
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,740
我為舞會買了兩件裙子
I bought two dresses for the ball.

85
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,310
-為什么  -因為
- Why? - Well,

86
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,540
我爸替我挑裙子  每年
my dad picks out my dress for me, and every year,

87
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,750
他挑的都基本一樣
it's like he picks out the exact same one.

88
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,940
無聊
Boring.

89
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,370
所以今年  我去了商場
So this year I was at the mall

90
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,690
看到了一件完美的裙子
and I saw the perfect one and...

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
我就沒忍住
I couldn't help myself.

92
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,950
你不會穿的
You'll never wear it.

93
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,280
爸爸的小天使
Daddy's little angel.

94
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,370
你穿什么  謝伊
What are you wearing, Shay?

95
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,670
真美
Oh, that's gorgeous.

96
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,040
是你爸爸選的嗎
Did your dad pick it out?

97
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,170
我試了一堆我喜歡的  但是他挑的
I tried on a bunch that I liked, but yeah.

98
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,860
凱爾說這件最好
Kyle said this one was the best.

99
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,220
你喊你爸凱爾
You call your dad Kyle?

100
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,180
她兩個月前才認識他的
She only met him two months ago.

101
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,960
每年女兒節
Every year on Daughter's Day,

102
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,730
我們都齊聚于此
we gather together here

103
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,070
談論一個年輕姑娘人生中兩段
to talk about the two most important relationships

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,780
最重要的關系
in a young girl's life:

105
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,370
她跟天父的關系  阿門
Her relationship with her Heavenly Father, amen...

106
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,300
-阿門  -以及她跟
- Amen. - And her relationship

107
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,260
人間父親的關系  阿門
with her earthly father, amen.

108
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,790
-阿門  -阿門
- Amen. - Amen.

109
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,810
我的女兒  萊西
My own daughter, Lacey,

110
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,580
這是她第十屆舞會
this is her 10th ball.

111
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,190
這是她第十次的貞潔起誓
This is her 10th pledge of purity.

112
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,190
感謝上帝
Woo, thank you, Lord!

113
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,090
父親們都理解我的
You fathers know what I'm talking about, I bet.

114
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,590
我真幸運
Man, am I blessed.

115
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,890
十年前  我開始推動父女們的關系
When I started bringing fathers and daughters together a decade ago,

116
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,390
建立了這間教堂
I built this church,

117
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,810
我做了這些彩窗
and I had these windows made

118
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,830
因為我覺得我必須
because I felt compelled

119
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,250
講述一個不常被講述
to tell a story that is not often told

120
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,990
但如今非常重要的故事
but is vitally important nowadays.

121
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,510
女士們先生們  夏娃并非第一個女人
You see, ladies and gentlemen, Eve was not the first woman.

122
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,660
不是的  你們肯定不知道
No, no, she was not, I bet you didn't know that.

123
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,970
上帝彎下身  拿人間的黏土
When God bent down and made Adam

124
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,080
塑造了亞當時
out of the dust of this earth,

125
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,380
他還拿一樣的黏土做了個女人
he also made a woman out of that same clay,

126
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,380
她叫莉莉絲
and her name was Lilith.

127
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,850
莉莉絲很獨立
Now, Lilith was independent.

128
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,100
很固執
She was strong-willed,

129
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,100
但她也很淫蕩
but she was lustful.

130
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,370
莉莉絲被逮到
Lilith was caught

131
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,810
跟一個天使通奸
fornicating with a member of the heavenly host.

132
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,480
你可以說有個天使吻了她  是的
You might say she was kissed by an angel, yes, she was,

133
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,170
但當我們的主和天父上帝得知后
but when Lord, our God and Father, found out,

134
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,050
他立刻施以了嚴厲的懲罰
his punishment was swift and it was severe.

135
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,470
因為在天上的主  上帝
You see, because our Lord, God above,

136
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,260
把莉莉絲直接送進了地獄
sent Lilith straight to hell.

137
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,450
阿門
Amen.

138
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,910
去地獄
To hell.

139
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,020
然后  天父又為亞當造了個女人
Then, our Father set out to create another woman for Adam,

140
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,170
但這次
but this time,

141
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,400
他是用亞當自己的身體做的
he did so by using a rib from Adam's own body.

142
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,340
是的
Yes, he did.

143
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,230
他說她是個更好的女人
He said she was a better woman,

144
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,550
是的  她是更好
and yes, she was better,

145
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,270
但她也很脆弱
but she was also fragile.

146
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,870
她需要指引
She needed guidance.

147
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,790
我們的主上帝告訴我們
Our Lord God tells us

148
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,040
如果沒有強大的男人提供指引
that without a strong man to offer guidance,

149
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,940
我們的女兒也可能淪落成莉莉絲
our daughters may end up just like Lilith!

150
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,860
她可能會落入地獄
She may end up in hell.

151
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,580
瞧  各位  這是生死大事
See, folks, this is life or death we are talking about here.

152
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,870
生死大事
This is life or death.

153
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,600
這就是我們本周齊聚于此的原因
And that is why we are here this week.

154
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,710
我們祈禱吧
Let us pray.

155
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,090
親愛的天父
Dear Heavenly Father...

156
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,730
我們這周也要拍一張這個
And we're gonna take one of these this week.

157
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,770
其中有你和喬的嗎
Are there any of you and Jo?

158
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,370
她第一年是12歲
Well, her first year she was 12,

159
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,740
她可能翻出來燒了
so she probably found it and burned it.

160
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,030
我每年都滿懷希望地帶她來
I bring her every year hoping, but, uh,

161
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,990
但她就是似乎不怎么喜歡
she just doesn't seem to like it very much.

162
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,490
向我保證
Make me a promise?

163
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,200
這周末
This weekend,

164
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,580
對我非常重要
it's really important to me.

165
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,880
好好試試  謝伊
Give this a shot, Shay.

166
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,090
真正去嘗試
A real shot.

167
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,550
我保證
I promise.

168
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,940
謝伊  來一口嗎
Shay, want a hit?

169
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,360
-好  -怎么了
- Yeah, sure. - What?

170
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,250
等等  怎么回事
Wait, so, what's the deal?

171
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,790
繼姐妹嗎
Half-sisters?

172
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,120
一個爸爸  不是一個媽媽
Uh, same dad, different moms.

173
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,480
但你們是同齡
But you're the same age?

174
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,140
對
Yeah.

175
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,060
凱爾之前不知道我的存在
Kyle didn't even know I existed

176
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,480
直到今年夏天
until, like, this summer,

177
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,200
但他現在想要彌補
but he's trying to do the right thing now,

178
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,630
所以我才來了
so that's why I'm here.

179
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,800
看吧
See?

180
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,030
所以我們今晚不能邀請她
This is why we can't invite her tonight.

181
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,240
她一心想巴結他  她會告密的
She is so far up his ass, she'll just tell him.

182
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,270
告什么密
Tell him what?

183
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,230
穿衣服
Get dressed.

184
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,060
但該睡覺了
But it's bedtime.

185
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,700
我們要去冒險
We're going on a little adventure.

186
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,860
不了  謝謝
Oh, no, thank you.

187
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,730
不  你是個風險
No, you're a liability.

188
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,750
說真的
Seriously,

189
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,360
你的人生也需要點樂子  來吧
you could use a little fun in your life, come on.

190
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,190
我不怎么喜歡冒險
Adventure isn't really my thing, guys,

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,050
我還是留下吧
so I'm gonna stay back here.

192
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,590
你真以為我們會留下你
You really think we're just gonna leave you here

193
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,430
讓你跑去告訴你爸嗎
so you can just run and tell Daddy?

194
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,640
拜托  萊西  凱莉安和我每年
Please, Lacey, this is KellyAnn and I's one time

195
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,680
就這么一次機會相見
to see each other all year.

196
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,080
給條活路吧
Let us live!

197
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,590
-好吧  -好嗎
- All right, fine. - Yeah?

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,760
我也去
I'm going with you.

199
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,640
好
Cool.

200
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,620
我們去哪
Where are we going?

201
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,080
每年的儀式
The yearly ritual.

202
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,540
你們每年都這么干
You do this every year?

203
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,810
對  我們一般不會跟
Yeah, we're not usually rooming

204
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,550
牧師的女兒同寢
with the pastor's daughter.

205
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,090
什么儀式
What's the ritual?

206
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,860
喬的莉莉絲儀式
Jo's Lilith ritual.

207
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,680
我們不是總住4號小屋
Okay, you know how we always stay in cabin 4.

208
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,950
突然之間
Out of the blue,

209
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,660
書架上出現了一本
this book shows up on this bookshelf,

210
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,620
關于莉莉絲的書
and it is all about Lilith.

211
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,450
我讀了
And I read it,

212
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,450
莉莉絲太厲害了
and Lilith is a total badass.

213
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,610
她是個惡魔
She's a demon.

214
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,290
-不  萊西  -她在地獄里
- No, Lacey. - She's in hell.

215
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,130
在地獄里的人就是惡魔  喬
That's what you call people who are in hell, Jo.

216
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,000
不對  她是被誣告的天使
False, she was a wrongfully accused angel

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,300
書里都寫了
and it is all in the book.

218
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
別挑話頭
Don't get her started.

219
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,550
聽著  事情是這樣的
Listen, this is how it went down.

220
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,800
亞當不喜歡莉莉絲是與他平等創造的
So Adam didn't like that Lilith was created equal,

221
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,970
所以他編造了她上了個天使的謠言
so he made up this whole rumor that she fucked an angel

222
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,140
還說她是婊子
and he called her a whore

223
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,390
好騙上帝送她下地獄  他真那么做了
so that God would send her to hell, and He did.

224
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,770
《圣經》里都沒寫莉莉絲
Yeah, well, Lilith isn't even in the Bible,

225
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,190
我們就別提她了
so we shouldn't be talking about her.

226
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,710
《圣經》就是男性修正主義歷史
The Bible is male revisionist history.

227
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,550
莉莉絲是男人的受害者
Lilith was a victim of men,

228
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,230
就像我們
kinda like us.

229
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,930
你好夸張
You are so dramatic.

230
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,080
謝伊
Shay?

231
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,580
你是處女嗎
Are you a virgin?

232
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,470
該死  凱莉安  直入主題
Damn, KellyAnn, just gettin' right to it.

233
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,250
這...
Well...

234
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,590
是啊  你們不是嗎
Yeah. Aren't you guys?

235
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,710
當然
Of course.

236
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,760
你在學校受欺負嗎
Do you get shit at school?

237
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,150
我為此受了好多欺負  我就說
I get so much shit for it, and I'm like,

238
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,660
我不需要性來知道自己被愛
I don't need sex to know that I am loved,

239
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,180
因為上帝愛我
because I'm loved by God.

240
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,540
阿門  說得好
Amen! Yes.

241
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,980
但是
But what about, like...

242
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,230
接吻呢
like kissing?

243
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,360
兩個男孩
Two boys.

244
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,080
但我跟他們定了界限
But I set like boundaries with them

245
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,920
不讓他們越雷池
so they wouldn't go too far.

246
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,290
這是不對的
It's--it's wrong.

247
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,280
萊西  你沒吻過男孩嗎
Lacey, you've never kissed a boy?

248
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,740
沒  我想等到婚后
No, I'm--I'm waiting until marriage.

249
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,910
不然我會感到羞恥的
I'd be ashamed.

250
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,930
那就像在吻別人的丈夫
Really, it's like kissing somebody else's husband.

251
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,720
多惡心
It's gross.

252
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,210
真胡扯
That's such bullshit.

253
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,570
-天啊  -怎么了
- Oh, my God. - What is it?

254
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,050
你們得來看看這個
You guys have to come see this.

255
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,600
太完美了
It's perfect.

256
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,430
別碰那個
Don't touch that!

257
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,350
是個啟示
It's a sign.

258
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,560
莉莉絲愛動物
Lilith loves animals.

259
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,710
好吧  我們現在干什么
Okay, well, now what do we do?

260
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,570
這些東西看上去很酷
Okay, all this stuff, it looks really cool.

261
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
喬從一開始就
Jo's been collecting offerings

262
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,220
一直在為莉莉絲收集祭品
for Lilith since the very beginning.

263
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,790
你還缺氣元素
You're missing an air element.

264
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
你不是需要全部四種元素嗎
Shouldn't you have all four elements?

265
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,460
繼續說
Go on.

266
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,000
好吧  你有土了
Okay, well, you have earth...

267
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,800
水
Water.

268
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,340
我偷的圣水
Holy water, that I stole.

269
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,800
還有火
And you have fire.

270
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,070
你需要氣
You need air.

271
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,970
我看像恐怖的黑魔法
Looks like creepy black magic to me.

272
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,740
就好像你想召喚惡魔
Like you're trying to summon a demon.

273
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,770
萊西  莉莉絲不是惡魔
Lacey, Lilith is not a demon.

274
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,600
我是要嘗試召喚她
And I am trying to call her.

275
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,440
我想把她救出地獄
I wanna raise her from hell!

276
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,690
那是誰
Who's that?

277
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,630
伙計們  這是我男友杰克
Guys, this is my boyfriend Jack.

278
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,310
你帶酒了嗎
Did you bring the wine?

279
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,520
你說你會拿酒來的
You said you would bring wine!

280
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,770
我爸真會殺了我的
My dad will literally kill me.

281
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,790
你怎么認識他們的
How do you even know them?

282
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,370
我去年夏天認識他的
I met him last summer.

283
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,620
我從小團體溜出來
I snuck out of Small Group,

284
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,290
那周末我們一起玩了幾次
then we hung out a couple times that weekend

285
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,340
此后我們每天都發短信
and we've texted every day since.

286
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,160
怪不得你今年又回來了
Well, now we know the reason why you came back this year.

287
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,170
他好性感
He's hot.

288
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,160
而且也是個處男
And he's a virgin too.

289
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,300
伙計們  我們不能跟他們一起玩
Guys, we can't hang out with them.

290
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,160
萊西  放松
Lacey, relax.

291
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,120
謝伊
Shay?

292
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,250
我們做儀式吧
Let's do the ritual.

293
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,510
你離開群體了
You strayed from the herd.

294
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,390
我在找東西
I'm looking for something.

295
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
什么東西
Yeah, what's that?

296
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,910
我看到時就知道了
I will know it when I see it.

297
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,060
我是謝伊
I'm Shay.

298
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,230
蓋布  杰克的親戚
Gabe, Jack's cousin.

299
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,450
你是個《圣經》狂嗎
So, uh, you a crazy Bible-thumper or what?

300
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,260
幾個月前  我都沒
Couple months ago, I didn't even know

301
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,080
進過教堂
what the inside of a church looked like.

302
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,910
所以你是第一次參加貞潔舞會
So you're new to this purity ball drill.

303
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,410
那當然了
It's a lot.

304
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,290
"當然"有很多意思
"A lot" can mean a lot of things.

305
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,650
很棒  很無聊
Awesome, boring,

306
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,130
很蠢  很可怕
stupid, creepy?

307
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,720
我不知道
I don't know.

308
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,220
我覺得會很有趣  但是...
I mean, I think it could be cool, but...

309
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,620
自從我決定來這里之后
I'm having these awful nightmares, every night,

310
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,020
我每天都做噩夢
since before we even decided to come up here.

311
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,870
找到了
Found it.

312
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,620
空氣
Air.

313
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,450
現在四種元素都齊了
Now we have all four elements.

314
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,020
莉莉絲
Lilith...

315
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,430
各位  我不喜歡這樣
All right, guys, I don't like this.

316
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,040
莉莉絲  我知道你在
Lilith, I know you're here.

317
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,460
給我們個征兆
Give us a sign.

318
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,430
謝伊  你能陪我回去嗎
Shay, will you go back with me?

319
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,320
我想留下
I kinda wanna stay.

320
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,490
萊西  放松
Lacey, chill.

321
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,770
我要走了
All right, I'm leaving.

322
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,200
等等
Just wait.

323
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
你不能一個人走
You can't go alone.

324
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,520
瑞恩陪她
Ryan will take her.

325
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,270
對嗎  瑞
Won't you, Ry?

326
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,860
-陪她走回去  -沒問題
- Walk her back. - Cool.

327
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,990
你知道你們要去哪里  對吧
You know where you're going though, right?

328
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,340
-好  -太好了  再見  走吧
- Okay. - Great, bye, go.

329
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,910
好  我們手拉手
Okay, join hands.

330
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,210
莉莉絲
Lilith.

331
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,840
崛起  歸來
Rise. Return.

332
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,840
審判的時刻到來了
It's time for the Reckoning.

333
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,430
出現吧
Show yourself.

334
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,010
凱利安
KellyAnn?

335
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,600
莉莉絲
Lilith.

336
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,600
崛起  歸來
Rise. Return.

337
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,770
審判的時刻到來了
It's time for the Reckoning.

338
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,730
謝伊
Shay?

339
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,200
莉莉絲  在今晚
Lilith, on this night,

340
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,380
匯集泥土  狂風  火苗以及水源
gather earth, wind, fire, and water,

341
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,700
來恢復萬物的平衡
to restore balance to all things.

342
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,200
崛起  歸來
Rise. Return.

343
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,330
審判的時刻到來了
It's time for the Reckoning.

344
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,470
黑暗將至  莉莉絲
The darkness is coming, Lilith.

345
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,380
如果你在這里  給我們個征兆
Give us a sign you're here.

346
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,700
什么情況
What the hell?

347
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,350
這是假的  對嗎
Those are... those are fake, right?

348
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,940
那是什么
What's that?

349
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,400
-有人來了  -該死  你得走了
- Someone's coming. - Shit, you gotta go.

350
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,900
-快走  快走  -什么情況
- Go, go, go, go. - What's going on?

351
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,240
快走
Go, go, go!

352
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,610
等等  凱利安
Wait, KellyAnn.

353
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,530
這些東西怎么辦
What about all this stuff?

354
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,300
快點  快點
Come on, come on.

355
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,920
萊西  你錯過了好戲
Lacey, you missed it.

356
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,260
發生了什么
What happened?

357
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,390
那太奇怪了  對嗎
That was so creepy, right?

358
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,030
那些蠟燭  喬把它們都吹滅了
Those candles, Jo blew them all out,

359
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,030
然后它們又著了
then they lit back up.

360
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,740
或許沒有完全熄滅
Okay, but maybe they weren't out all the way.

361
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,690
-不  就是莉莉絲來了  -別說了  喬
- No, it was Lilith. - Stop, Jo.

362
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,080
你們在耍我
You guys are messing with me.

363
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
為什么每次都沒成功
Why would it work this time

364
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,410
而這次卻成功了
when it's never worked before?

365
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,730
或許是因為謝伊
Maybe it was Shay.

366
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,670
謝伊是新加入的
Shay's new.

367
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,280
謝伊有什么特別的
What's special about Shay?

368
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,000
-抱歉  謝伊  -沒事
- Sorry, Shay. - No, no.

369
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,990
我確實沒什么特別的
There's nothing special about me.

370
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,990
你們最好祈禱不會有壞事發生  喬
You better pray you didn't make something bad happen, Jo.

371
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,040
壞事已經發生了  萊西
Bad things are already happening, Lacey.

372
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,140
崛起
Rise.

373
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,260
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

374
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,180
我沒事
Yeah, I'm fine.

375
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,060
不餓嗎
Not hungry?

376
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,900
餓  但我要穿得上我的裙子
Starving, but I need to fit into my dress.

377
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,370
那是怎么回事
What's that about?

378
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,970
感謝  早上好  瑪麗
Appreciate it. Good morning, Mary.

379
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,250
我知道那女孩
Oh, I know that girl.

380
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,340
你能跟我來嗎
Could you follow me?

381
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,590
他們要把她帶到哪里去
Where are they taking her?

382
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,050
賽斯牧師有時喜歡這種
Pastor Seth likes to have these, uh,

383
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,090
和女生一對一的談話
personal chats with the girls sometimes.

384
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,220
你彩排過了嗎
Did you get your run in?

385
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,990
我睡過頭了
Uh, I, I overslept.

386
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,520
我們談過的
We talked about this.

387
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,080
我知道  爸爸  對不起
I know, Dad, I'm sorry.

388
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,400
別跟我道歉
Don't apologize to me.

389
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,730
痛苦的是你
It's you who suffers.

390
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,490
周日就是女兒節了
Now, Sunday is Daughter's Day.

391
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,330
會是美好的一天
It is going to be a beautiful day.

392
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,180
事實上  這一天可能會成為
As a matter of fact, it may well be

393
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,630
你們女兒一生中最重要的一天
the most important night in your young daughter's life.

394
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,020
整個周末最重要的環節
See, the most important part of this entire weekend

395
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,480
就是簽署那份契約
is the signing of that contract.

396
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,610
父親和女兒  在上帝的見證下  阿門
Father and daughter, with God as our witness, amen.

397
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,220
-阿門  -契約
- Amen. - Contract?

398
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,030
希望你們今天讀《圣經》了
Hope you did your Bible reading today.

399
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,560
如果你們沒讀  我現在給你們讀
If you didn't, I'll do it for you right now.

400
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,950
《新約·希伯來書》第十三章第四節
Hebrews Chapter 13, Verse 4.

401
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,790
在書中  祂說道
And in the book, he says,

402
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,250
"人人都應該尊重婚姻
"Marriage should be honored by all

403
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,540
婚床也要保持圣潔"
and the marriage bed kept pure."

404
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,320
還是這個詞  "圣潔"
There's that word again, "Pure."

405
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,090
"因為茍合行淫的人  神必要審判"
"For God will judge all of the sexually immoral."

406
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,630
神必要審判
God will judge.

407
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,510
"賽斯牧師  什么是茍合行淫"
"Pastor Seth, what is sexually immoral?"

408
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,960
我們來舉幾個例子好嗎
Let's take a couple of softballs on this one, okay?

409
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,790
自慰
Masturbation.

410
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,920
是罪惡嗎
Is that a sin?

411
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,340
是的  尷尬
Yes, it is. Awkward.

412
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,980
同性戀
Homosexuality.

413
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,050
是罪惡嗎
Is it a sin?

414
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,840
是的
Yes, it is,

415
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,150
因為《圣經》就是這么說的
because the Bible tells us so.

416
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,320
婚前性行為是罪惡嗎
Is sex before marriage a sin?

417
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,260
當然是
Absolutely, yes, it is!

418
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,820
你們可能會說
You might say,

419
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,990
"我們如何才能在婚前避免性行為
"How do I avoid having sex before marriage?

420
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,830
這太難了
It's so difficult.

421
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,290
性欲是如此強大的力量"
Lust is such a powerful force."

422
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,210
猜猜什么比它更強大  愛更強大
Well, guess what's stronger than that. Love is stronger.

423
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,250
什么更強大  上帝更強大
Guess what's stronger than that. God is stronger.

424
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,460
那個陪你走過這一切的男人
The man walking beside you through all this thing

425
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,500
他更強大
is stronger than that.

426
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,960
我們這周末歡聚于此
We are here this weekend

427
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,570
是為了讓你們免受自己的傷害
to protect you from yourselves.

428
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,460
天吶
Wow.

429
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,560
親愛的主  非常感謝你
Lord God, thank you so much.

430
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,190
他真的很擅長
You know, He has-- He has a great way

431
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,310
搶奪舞臺上的焦點
of always taking the spotlight back.

432
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,690
所以讓我們抬頭注視祂
So let's focus upward to Him

433
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,400
我們今天下午再見
and I'll see you a little bit later this afternoon.

434
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,440
-阿門  -阿門
- Amen? - Amen.

435
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,640
好  我們走
All right, let's go.

436
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,190
這些契約是什么
So what are these contracts?

437
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,440
就是
It's just like,

438
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,320
一些爸爸不在身邊  你不能干的事
don't do anything you wouldn't do if your dad was watching.

439
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,320
很有用的
It's helpful.

440
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,040
她怎么了
What happened to her?

441
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,670
或許她在檢查它們的處女膜
Maybe he's checking for their hymens or something.

442
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,020
你在開玩笑嗎
You're joking?

443
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,380
你真惡心
You're sick.

444
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,090
他可能帶她去了"魔盒"里
He probably just took her to The Box.

445
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,400
什么是"魔盒"
What's The Box?

446
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,760
喬  你的白內衣呢
Jo, where are your whites?

447
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,740
手冊上說你要穿白色的內衣
The handbook says that you need to wear all white undergarments.

448
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,540
手冊上說任何東西都要是白色的
The handbook says all white everything.

449
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,600
胸罩  內褲  襪子  我知道
Bras, panties, socks. I know.

450
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,320
你又要告訴你爸嗎
You gonna tell your dad... again?

451
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,820
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

452
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,400
昨晚嗎
Last night?

453
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,300
不  我什么都沒說
No, I didn't say anything.

454
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,920
在你們回來之前  我一直在和瑞恩聊天
I was talking to Ryan until right before you guys got back.

455
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,870
天吶  萊西觸電了
Ooh, Lacey has a lady boner.

456
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,960
我沒有
I do not.

457
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,330
如果你不能談戀愛的話  你怎么辦
If you can't date, what do you do?

458
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,380
我爸會從教堂里挑一個人給我
My dad will choose somebody from the church for me.

459
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,360
或者我喜歡上了某個人
Or if I like somebody,

460
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,400
我讓我爸視察一下
I'll, uh, bring them to my dad for inspection.

461
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,430
視察  聽起來挺性感的
Inspection? Sounds sexy.

462
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,100
好吧  但你不好奇那是什么感覺嗎
Okay, but aren't you curious about what it's like?

463
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,430
牽手
Hold hands.

464
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,560
或許親吻
Maybe kiss.

465
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,360
好奇
Yeah.

466
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,110
我就知道  就是有感覺了
Knew it. Lady boner.

467
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,580
喬  你為什么不認真對待這一切
Jo, why don't you ever take this seriously?

468
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,220
我只是覺得男人不應該控制
I just don't think men should control

469
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,430
我們做的每件事
everything that we do,

470
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,620
特別是關于我們的肉體
especially when it comes to our bodies.

471
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,520
凱爾只是想讓我們有個愉快的周末
Meanwhile, Kyle just wants us to have a good weekend,

472
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
你能認真做完嗎
so can't you do that?

473
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,340
天吶  你真戀父  謝伊
God, you have such daddy issues, Shay.

474
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,180
很惡心
It's gross.

475
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,950
說真的  你為什么喜歡他
Seriously, why do you like him?

476
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,490
-太難聽了  喬  -這不是凱爾的錯
- Harsh, Jo. - It's not Kyle's fault.

477
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,950
他根本就不知道我
He never knew about me.

478
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,580
他根本不知道我媽媽懷孕了
He never even knew my mom was pregnant.

479
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,290
他在我剛出生的時候背叛了我媽
He was cheating on my mom when I was a newborn.

480
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,290
要是我會很生氣
I'd be so pissed.

481
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,960
我就是很生氣
I am pissed.

482
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,080
你為什么不生氣  謝伊
Why aren't you, Shay?

483
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,280
因為我終于有爸爸了
Because I finally have a dad!

484
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,280
我不會就這樣讓他離開
I'm not just gonna give him up.

485
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,620
好吧
Okay.

486
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,910
喬
Jo.

487
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,790
我們又回來了
And we're back!

488
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,190
在這個下午
You know what though, this afternoon,

489
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,840
我想做一些完全不同的事
I think I want to do something completely different.

490
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,470
我需要一個人自愿上臺來
I'm going to need a volunteer to come up on stage.

491
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,220
讓我看看
Let's see.

492
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,970
謝伊
Shay.

493
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,980
你能到臺上來和我一起嗎
Would you do me the honor of joining me on stage?

494
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,580
大家見過謝伊嗎  跟她打個招呼
Has everybody met Shay? Say, "Hello, Shay."

495
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,120
你好  謝伊
Hello, Shay.

496
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,210
這是謝伊第一次來
This is Shay's first time,

497
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,530
她來了
and here she is,

498
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,800
準備好完成這周末的任務
ready to do the work on fire this weekend.

499
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,420
快看
Look at that.

500
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,030
謝伊  我有個問題問你
Shay, I got a question for you.

501
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,570
你喜歡...
Do you like...

502
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,410
口香糖嗎
gum?

503
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,830
-喜歡  -喜歡  好的
- Yes. - Yes, okay.

504
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,830
看看這塊口香糖
Take a look at this piece of gum.

505
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,130
現在  這塊口香糖應該是
Right now, it is as it should be.

506
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,630
新的  很好吃的
Brand new and fresh.

507
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,380
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh.

508
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,590
真好吃
Oh, that's the one.

509
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,600
但是現在
But now,

510
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,520
謝伊  你愿意把這塊放到嘴里嗎
Shay, would you put this in your mouth?

511
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,280
-不  -不  你不愿意
- No. - No, you wouldn't,

512
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,940
因為它被嚼過了
because it's been chewed!

513
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,690
沒人想要這塊
And nobody wants that,

514
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,020
因為它被用過了
because it's been used.

515
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,550
你們女士必須明白
See, it is imperative that you ladies understand

516
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,570
你們有義務
you have an obligation.

517
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,580
上帝要求你們  要保持圣潔
It is a requirement of God that you remain untouched.

518
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,880
抱歉各位  稍等一下
I'm so sorry, everybody, uh, just one second.

519
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,690
抱歉大家  等我一下
Sorry, folks. Just stick with me one second.

520
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,800
我來解決這個問題
We'll figure this out.

521
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,860
很明顯大家已經明白我的意思了
Okay, clearly everybody's had enough of me.

522
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,950
你們知道我們要干什么  我們去大廳里
You know what we'll do, we'll go to the lodge,

523
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,560
再次小組討論  謝謝大家
Small Group once again, thank you all very much.

524
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,850
謝謝你  謝伊  非常感謝
Thank you, Shay, thank you so much.

525
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,860
喬
Jo.

526
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,990
事情不對勁
Something's going on.

527
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,570
當然了  他剛拿我們和嚼過的口香糖比較
Yeah, he just compared us to chewed-up gum.

528
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,660
我是說...
I mean...

529
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,950
我覺得昨晚成功了
I think it worked last night.

530
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,830
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

531
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,230
我不知道  好嗎
I don't know, I don't know, okay,

532
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,460
但剛才  那個話筒
but just now, with the speakers,

533
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,170
還有十字架
and the cross.

534
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,920
聽起來很愚蠢
It sounds stupid,

535
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,180
但如果我們昨晚真的召喚出了什么東西呢
but what if we really did, like, call something last night?

536
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,180
萊西的惡魔論對你影響很大啊
Lacey's demon talk is really getting to you, huh?

537
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,390
你要放松
You need to relax.

538
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,770
真的
Seriously.

539
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,110
所以我要去見杰克
That's why I'm gonna go meet Jack.

540
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,230
小組討論的時候幫我打掩護  好嗎
So, cover for me in Small Group, yeah?

541
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,780
告訴他們我肚子疼
Tell them I have cramps.

542
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,610
還是告訴他們我瘋了
Tell them I was possessed.

543
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,660
我一直在找你
I've been looking for you.

544
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,080
你不該來這里
You should not be here.

545
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,660
你要去哪里
Where are you goin'?

546
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,100
我們要去小組討論
We have these... Small Group things

547
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,730
一起討論什么之類的
where we just talk about stuff.

548
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,420
聽起來不錯
Sounds like a lot.

549
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,800
確實
It is.

550
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,260
我有個想法
I have a proposal.

551
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,590
走吧
Come on.

552
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,420
你的童貞舞會怎么樣了
So how's it going with your...virginity ball?

553
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,910
是貞潔舞會
Purity ball!

554
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,620
差不多
Same thing.

555
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,120
我一直在想我媽
I keep thinking about my mom,

556
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,500
她會怎么看待這件事
like what she would think about the whole thing.

557
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,050
我知道她不會喜歡牧師的那番話
I know she wouldn't love the way the pastor talks.

558
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,550
這是肯定的
That's for sure.

559
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,730
只有爸爸們來感覺很奇怪
And it's weird that only the dads come.

560
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,020
喬的媽媽非常想來
Jo's mom really wanted to come.

561
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,010
喬說她每年都大發雷霆
Jo says she throws a fit every year.

562
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,220
你媽媽怎么樣
What about your mom?

563
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,520
她幾個月前去世了
She died a couple months ago.

564
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,900
所以他們替我找到了凱爾
That's why they found Kyle for me.

565
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,450
他是我爸爸
He's my dad.

566
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,080
我之前都不知道他
I didn't know him before.

567
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,790
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

569
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,400
我差點忘了
I almost forgot. I, uh, 

570
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
我給你帶了點東西
I got you something.

571
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,850
你之前說你做噩夢
You, uh, you said you were having nightmares.

572
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,270
謝謝你
Thank you.

573
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,210
賽斯牧師說許多女孩
You know, Pastor Seth says a lot of girls

574
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,530
和她們的父親都沒有良好的關系
don't have good relationships with their fathers.

575
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,080
她們開始在錯誤的地方尋找驗證
They start looking for validation in the wrong places,

576
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,790
最后總會惹上麻煩
end up in trouble.

577
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,420
你打算現在從我身上尋求驗證嗎
Are you looking for validation right now from me?

578
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,630
我不知道
I don't know.

579
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,170
我會惹上麻煩嗎
Am I gonna end up in trouble?

580
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,050
或許吧
Maybe.

581
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,020
-等等  -怎么了
- Wait. - What?

582
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,660
我要去游泳
I'm going swimming.

583
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,640
別用那處女眼看我
Don't look at me with those virgin eyes.

584
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,620
來呀
Come on!

585
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,250
我來了  我來了  我來了
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

586
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,150
我喜歡你  謝伊
I like you, Shay.

587
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,750
崛起
Rise.

588
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,460
怎么了
What's wrong?

589
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,750
有人在那
Someone's there.

590
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,720
沒人呀
Nobody's there.

591
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
謝伊
Hey, Shay!

592
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
你怕什么
What are you afraid of?

593
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,360
對不起  我該
Sorry, I should, um,

594
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,570
我該走了
I should go.

595
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,490
蓋布
Gabe!

596
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,450
怎么了
What?

597
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
沒事的  你看
It's okay, see?

598
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,790
我身上有嗎
Are there any on me though?

599
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,750
沒有
No.

600
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,130
你很完美
You're perfect.

601
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,350
今晚來見我
Come see me tonight?

602
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,190
也許吧
Maybe.

603
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,630
你來了  我沒想到你會來
You came. I didn't think you were gonna come.

604
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,300
我也是
Me neither.

605
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,010
我好緊張
I'm so nervous.

606
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,640
我想吻你
Look, I want to kiss you.

607
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,070
-你看起來像天使  -謝謝
- You look like an angel. - Thank you.

608
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,130
你去哪了
Where've you been?

609
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,740
去游泳了
I went for a swim.

610
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,010
你錯過了小組討論
You missed Small Group.

611
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,890
讓我很難堪
It makes me look bad.

612
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,450
也許你比我想的更像你的姐姐
Maybe you are more like your sister than I thought.

613
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,980
這不公平
That is not fair.

614
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,740
你得再努力點  謝伊
You need to try harder, Shay.

615
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,950
對不起
I'm sorry.

616
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,580
洗洗干凈
Get yourself cleaned up.

617
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,710
一小時后去大廳見我
Meet me at the lodge in an hour.

618
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,050
打扮得漂亮點
Try and look nice, please.

619
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,120
崛起  歸來
Rise. Return.

620
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,160
{\an8}莉莉絲

621
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,840
{\an8}莉莉絲

622
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,550
{\an8}謊言

623
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,390
{\an8}罪與女性性欲

624
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,310
{\an8}召喚

625
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,630
{\an8}歸來和審判

626
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,840
{\an8}當星星排成直線  莉莉絲會歸來大地

627
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,030
{\an8}她需要一副嘗過禁果的肉體

628
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,840
我有東西給你
I got you something.

629
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,180
我希望這個貞潔戒指能提醒你
I want this purity ring to remind you

630
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,770
我會一直在這指引你的路
that I'll always be here to show you the way.

631
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,850
但如果你不珍惜自己
But I'm not gonna give it to you

632
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,900
我不會給你
if you're not gonna value yourself.

633
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,290
我不確定你今天下午去干什么了
I'm not sure what you were up to this afternoon,

634
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,130
但我覺得我花費了這么多時間
but I don't think it's fair that I'm putting my time into this

635
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,110
但你卻自己去玩了是很不公平的
and you're off doing your own thing.

636
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,740
你覺得公平嗎
Does that seem fair to you?

637
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,160
如果你媽有個堅強的父親
If your mom had a strong father figure,

638
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,870
如果她也許過這樣的諾言
if she had taken a pledge like this,

639
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,920
如果她尊重自己
if she had respected herself,

640
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,840
一切都會不同  對吧
things would've been different, right?

641
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,430
我能給你戴上
Can I put this on you

642
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,510
告訴別人你很特別嗎
as a sign to others that you're special?

643
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,270
堅定
Committed.

644
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,400
我能
I can, um...

645
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,340
你沒替我打掩護
So you didn't cover for me.

646
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,410
抱歉
Sorry.

647
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,330
我本該是這里的害群之馬
You know, I'm supposed to be the black sheep around here.

648
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,190
爸爸習慣了我搞砸一切
You know, Dad is used to me fucking up,

649
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,670
但你也沒去  他真的很驚訝
but really threw him when you didn't show up either.

650
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,760
超有趣
Super entertaining.

651
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,140
但真正令人意外的是小萊西
But the biggest upset was little Lacey over here.

652
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,430
你沒來時塞斯牧師差點瘋掉
Pastor Seth almost lost his mind when you didn't show.

653
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,820
我說了  我肚子疼
I told you, I had cramps.

654
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,730
這是我的臺詞
Nuh-uh, that's my line.

655
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,490
我們以為他也許把你關進魔盒了
We thought maybe he put you in The Box.

656
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,790
沒有什么魔盒  喬
There is no Box, Jo.

657
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,910
什么是魔盒
What is The Box?

658
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,460
塞斯牧師的秘密房間  用來懲罰
Pastor Seth's secret room...for punishment.

659
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,360
用來祈禱  但這只是個傳說
For prayer, but it's just a myth.

660
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,950
我得去幫忙布置了
I gotta go help set up.

661
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,910
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

662
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,000
那么
So...

663
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,130
杰克怎么樣
how's Jack?

664
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,390
他很好
He's good.

665
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,930
他想要
He wants to, um,

666
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,990
你們懂  但我們還沒做
you know, but we-- we haven't yet.

667
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,560
你知道我們來這是為了承諾貞潔  對吧
You know we are literally here to pledge purity, right?

668
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,860
你想嗎  和他做
Do you want to, with him?

669
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,330
同齡的男孩想做愛
Boys our age want to bone,

670
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,740
我們的爸爸想讓我們保持童身
and our dads want us to stay virgins.

671
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,710
我怎么想真的重要嗎
So, does it really matter what I want?

672
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,450
當然
Yeah.

673
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,160
重要
It does.

674
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,430
下一個是我們  你的戒指呢
We're next. Do you have your rings?

675
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,680
其實我丟了
Actually, I lost mine.

676
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,770
我真的到處都找了
I promise I looked everywhere.

677
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,360
我和謝伊拍吧
I'll take it with Shay.

678
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,620
好
Okay.

679
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,040
完美
Perfect.

680
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,170
近一點
Little closer.

681
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,740
很美
Beautiful.

682
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,850
下一對
Next.

683
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,160
凱利安  我們說好的那條裙子呢
KellyAnn, what happened to the dress we talked about?

684
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,360
還太緊嗎
Still too snug?

685
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,950
笑一個  寶貝
Smile, baby.

686
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,490
你笑的時候美多了
You're so much prettier when you smile.

687
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,380
爸爸  你還好嗎
Dad, are you okay?

688
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,260
你爸爸還好嗎
Is your dad okay?

689
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,610
他說他感到有東西推他
He says he felt something push him down.

690
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,800
是不是很可怕
Isn't that freaky?

691
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,310
我也見了些東西
I mean, I've seen things too.

692
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,890
聽見聲音
Heard things.

693
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,770
我以為我看見莉莉絲了
I thought I saw Lilith.

694
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,750
她要來找我  我不知道該怎么辦
She's coming for me, I don't know what to do.

695
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,830
謝伊  別說了  你和喬一樣壞
Shay, stop, you're as bad as Jo.

696
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,380
萊西說她是個惡魔
Lacey said she's a demon.

697
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,570
我以為你們相信惡魔
I thought you all believed in demons.

698
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,700
我相信
I mean, I believe in them, but...

699
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,910
但他們不在這
they're not, like, here now.

700
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,080
你知道這聽起來很瘋狂  對吧
You know how crazy that sounds, right?

701
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,190
想讓我幫你切肉嗎  爸爸
Want me to cut your meat, Dad?

702
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,340
謝謝  親愛的
Thanks, honey.

703
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,680
各位晚上好
Hi, everyone.

704
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,270
如果你們不認識我  我叫萊西
If you don't know me, my name is Lacey,

705
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,410
如我爸爸所說
and as my dad said,

706
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,830
這個周日是我第十個貞潔舞會
this Sunday will be my tenth purity ball.

707
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,560
感謝主  感謝主
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord.

708
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,450
我對上帝充滿了感激
I am so filled with gratitude to God

709
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,040
帶我走這么遠
for getting me this far.

710
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,910
這路并不容易
It is not an easy road.

711
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,170
很多人不理解
People, they don't understand.

712
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,340
她們取笑我們  覺得我們瘋了
They make fun of us and they think we're crazy.

713
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,930
但她們永遠無法理解
But they will never understand the joy

714
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,660
當告訴未來丈夫
of telling their future husbands

715
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,950
自己為其留童身時的快樂
that they waited for them.

716
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,950
這些幻想中的未來丈夫
Are these imaginary future husbands

717
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,350
也為婚姻保守貞潔嗎  萊西
also saving themselves for marriage, Lacey?

718
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,650
他們是處男嗎
Are they virgins?

719
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,570
喬  坐下
Jo, sit down.

720
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,050
對于年輕男性來說
well, um, it's much... it's much harder

721
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,760
保持貞潔更難
for young men to remain pure.

722
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,200
我們都知道
I mean, we-- we all know that.

723
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,580
我想我們只能
I think that all we can do is

724
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,750
讓我們的父親保護我們
ask our fathers to protect us.

725
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,170
我想給我未來的丈夫
I want to give my future husband

726
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,470
最好的禮物
the greatest gift,

727
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,470
這個禮物一輩子只能給一次
and that is a gift that you can only give once.

728
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,360
非常感謝你的問題  喬
Thank you so much for your question, Jo,

729
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,820
一直如此
as always.

730
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,690
我能告訴你答案
And I do have an answer for you.

731
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,710
我有兩個兒子
You see, I have two young sons.

732
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,590
但對年輕男性來說
But purity looks a little different

733
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:43,530
貞潔略有不同
for young men.

734
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,880
你瞧  他們不需要像女性一樣
See, they don't need to be monitored

735
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,590
接受相同的標準
the same way women do.

736
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,160
他們不容易上當
They are not as easily fooled.

737
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,710
喬
Jo?

738
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,960
愚蠢的萊西
Stupid Lacey.

739
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,840
我不該提問
I shouldn't have done that.

740
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,010
媽的
Shit.

741
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,510
至少那是個好問題
At least it was a good question.

742
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,850
我為什么總這么混蛋
Why am I always such a dick?

743
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,940
當你剛來時
When you first showed up here,

744
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,230
當
when, um...

745
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,490
當爸爸把你從機場帶回來時
when Dad brought you home from the airport,

746
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,700
我很同情你
I felt really bad for you.

747
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,450
因為他一直在我身邊
Because it's not fair that

748
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,670
卻不在你身邊  顯得很不公平
I had him my entire life and you didn't.

749
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,890
但之后我意識到我從未擁有過他
But then I realized I never actually had him.

750
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:52,310
他一點也不了解我
He doesn't know anything about me.

751
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,600
他不關心我
He doesn't care about me.

752
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,900
像我媽嗎
Like my mom?

753
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,130
她總是打兩份工
She always had to work two jobs,

754
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,250
我知道她是為了我
and I know she was doing it for me,

755
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,990
但我從沒機會見她  所以
but I never really got to see her, so...

756
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,760
我就一直醒著躺在床上
I would just lay awake in bed at night

757
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,370
想著我爸爸
and think about my dad.

758
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,210
他什么樣
What he looked like,

759
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,890
聲音如何
what he sounded like,

760
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,500
他喜歡做什么
what he liked to do.

761
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,880
很抱歉  謝伊
I'm sorry, Shay.

762
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,500
我看見他們之前帶走了她
I saw them take her earlier today.

763
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,300
也許他們給手術縫起來了
Maybe they're, um, surgically stitching them up.

764
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,700
認真點
Be serious.

765
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,910
你聽見了嗎
Do you hear that?

766
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,720
直訴自己意愿之人
He who's speaking will...

767
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,240
你看見桌子后面的門了嗎
Do you see that door behind the desk?

768
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,270
我們心中有恨意
There's hate in our hearts...

769
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,440
我賭那就是魔盒
I bet that's The Box.

770
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,460
女士們  背挺直
Ladies, backs nice and straight.

771
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,710
很好
Very good.

772
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,000
漂亮
Nice.

773
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,260
女士們  讓男士領舞
Ladies, let the men lead.

774
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:58,930
一  二  三  沒錯
And one, two, three, yes.

775
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,810
你和你媽長得真像
You look just like your mom.

776
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,320
以前經常有人這么說
I used to get that a lot.

777
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,570
她很美  對吧
She was beautiful, wasn't she?

778
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,660
對
Yeah.

779
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,740
你明晚要穿我們挑的那條裙子嗎
Are you going to wear the dress that we picked out tomorrow night?

780
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,620
嗯
Yes.

781
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,290
把頭發盤起來
Wear your hair up.

782
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,790
我喜歡你頭發盤起來
I like your hair up.

783
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,590
好
Okay.

784
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,090
你真是個好姑娘  謝伊
You're such a good girl, Shay.

785
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:43,400
崛起  歸來
Rise. Return.

786
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,360
謝伊
Shay?

787
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,200
抱歉  我不舒服
I'm sorry, I don't feel well.

788
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,530
你想干嗎
What do you want from me?

789
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,660
-你來了  -你嚇我
- You came. - You scared me!

790
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,980
對不起  對不起  跟我來
I'm sorry, I'm sorry-- hey, come with me.

791
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,030
以為你會放我鴿子
Thought you might leave me hanging.

792
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,660
我得離開那里
I really had to get out of there.

793
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,360
你有音樂嗎
Do you have any music?

794
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,360
-有  -我們上了舞蹈課
- Yeah. - We had a dance class.

795
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,240
是嗎
You did?

796
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,510
你們是和老爸一起跳嗎
What were you, like, dancing with your dads?

797
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,550
別鬧
Shut up!

798
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,200
好  手放這  慢點  好  好
Okay, hand here-- hold on, okay, okay.

799
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,370
我們要有點距離
We need space.

800
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,170
現在好了
Now we're good.

801
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,210
一  二  三
One, two, three,

802
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,520
一  二  三
one, two, three.

803
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,550
沒錯  就這樣
There you go, there you go!

804
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,400
等等  等等  等等  來這
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait--here, here.

805
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,220
好
Okay.

806
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,140
-先生  -女士
- Sir. - Oh...ma'am.

807
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,560
二  三
Two, three.

808
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,810
我要來點花式舞蹈了  好嗎
I'm going to get fancy on you, okay?

809
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,610
審判
The reckoning.

810
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,280
你聽到了嗎
Did you hear that?

811
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,950
聽到什么
Hear...what?

812
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,410
這里就我們
Hey, we're here alone.

813
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,250
謝伊
Hey, Shay.

814
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,930
那是誰
Who's that?

815
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:17,520
搞什么  混蛋  我想上床呢
Yo, come on, pricks, I'm trying to get laid here!

816
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,590
你是為了這個嗎
Is that what this is?

817
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,750
不是  拜托  那是
No, come on, it was--

818
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,200
只是開玩笑的
it was just a joke.

819
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,660
沒事的
It's okay.

820
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,910
滾開
Yo, fuck off!

821
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,640
你該離開這里
You should get out of here.

822
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,680
謝伊
Shay!

823
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,080
她不在這里
She's not here.

824
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,480
怎么回事
What's going on?

825
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:54,760
你在想什么
What were you thinking?

826
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,950
你們在說什么
What are you talking about?

827
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,560
你剛和一個男孩在一起  喬
You were with a boy, Jo.

828
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,770
我在睡覺
I was sleeping,

829
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,950
去上了個廁所
and I just had to pee.

830
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,230
別撒謊
Stop lying.

831
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,660
她告訴你的嗎
Did she tell you this?

832
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,220
她是個騙子
She's the liar.

833
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,260
-你覺得是我說的  -對
- Like, you think I told them? - Yes!

834
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,160
喬
Jo.

835
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,210
你得跟我們走
We just need you to come with us.

836
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,620
-我什么也沒做  -照做
- I didn't do anything. - Do as you're told!

837
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,860
去睡覺吧  姑娘們
Go to bed, ladies.

838
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,500
貞潔舞會快樂
Happy purity ball.

839
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,670
女兒節快樂
Happy Daughter's Day.

840
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,680
我小時候對這些事特別興奮
I used to get so excited for this when I was a little girl.

841
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,180
現在我只覺得疲憊
Now I just feel exhausted.

842
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,980
你可以對他說不  知道嗎
You can tell him no, you know?

843
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,980
勇敢面對他
Stand up to him.

844
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,650
對他說什么不
Tell him no what?

845
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,480
我不想再數著卡路里吃飯
I don't want to count calories anymore?

846
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,590
每天早上五點起來晨跑
Run at 5 A.M. every morning,

847
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:17,950
每周五稱體重
weigh-ins every Friday?

848
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,740
他是我爸爸
He's my dad.

849
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,160
你聽起來像喬
You sound like Jo.

850
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,120
她在哪
Where is she?

851
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,460
你管她呢
Why do you care?

852
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,810
昨晚是你讓她惹上麻煩的
You're the one who got her in trouble last night.

853
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:32,960
不是我
I didn't.

854
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,590
我不會那么做
I wouldn't do that.

855
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,300
誰告發的不重要
Well, it doesn't matter who told on her.

856
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,130
她在魔盒里  謝伊
She's in The Box, Shay.

857
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:05,130
{\an8}牧師
塞斯·麥克弗遜

858
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,290
謝伊
Shay.

859
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:12,710
請進
Come on in.

860
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,300
你有什么煩惱  謝伊
What is troubling you, Shay?

861
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,130
喬在哪
Where is Jo?

862
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,640
你爸也許知道昨天你去游泳了
Your dad may know that you went swimming yesterday.

863
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,810
但我沒告訴他你和一個男孩去的
But I didn't tell him it was with a boy.

864
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,690
他只是個朋友
He's just a friend.

865
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,650
你想懷孕嗎
Do you want to get pregnant?

866
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,030
你想死于艾滋嗎
Do you want to die of AIDS?

867
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,550
因為這是你現在走的路
Because that's the path you're on.

868
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:47,330
你真的想這樣讓你父親失望嗎
Do you really want to disappoint your father like this?

869
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,450
不想
No.

870
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,120
謝伊  你
Shay, you...

871
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:53,040
潛力無限
have so much potential.

872
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,960
你能成功
You can be good,

873
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,900
或讓喬毀了你的一切
or you can let Jo ruin everything for you.

874
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,270
因為現在就是如此
Because that is what is happening.

875
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,690
萊西違抗了上帝時
Look, when Lacey disobeys the Lord,

876
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:07,720
我沒有懲罰她  因為那不是我該做的事
I do not punish her, that is not my place.

877
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,360
但是我會確保
But I make absolutely sure

878
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,740
不會再出現那種事
that it does not happen again.

879
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,600
你知道我是怎么做到的嗎
Do you know how I do that?

880
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,520
這就是魔盒嗎
Is this The Box?

881
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:21,960
喬
Jo?

882
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,650
謝伊
Shay.

883
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,570
謝伊
Shay.

884
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:34,600
求你了  喬在哪里
Please, where's Jo?

885
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,130
那不重...
That's not imp...

886
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,850
走
Go.

887
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,190
離開這里
Get out of here.

888
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,030
快走
Go!

889
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:04,860
走
Go.

890
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,750
你找到喬了嗎
Any sign of Jo?

891
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,420
沒有
No.

892
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,590
等舞會開始  大家被分散注意力后
At the ball, when everyone's distracted,

893
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,590
我會找到她
I'm going to find her.

894
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:36,850
這是我爸爸給我挑的裙子
This is the dress my dad picked out for me.

895
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:45,070
但這是你喜歡的嗎
Is this the one you liked, though?

896
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,120
受喬的啟發
Inspired by Jo.

897
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,990
你應該穿上
You should wear it.

898
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,670
萊西
Lacey.

899
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,790
出什么事了
Hey, did something happen?

900
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,130
他對你做了什么嗎
Did he do something to you?

901
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,550
我看到你和萊安在樹林里
I saw you in the woods with Ryan.

902
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,050
你也在嗎
You were there?

903
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,510
發生了什么
What happened?

904
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,850
他親了我
He kissed me.

905
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,370
好吧  但是...只是這樣嗎
Okay, but is that... is that all?

906
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:18,290
因為你可以告訴我們的
Because you can tell us.

907
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,310
只是這樣嗎
Is that all?

908
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,730
這是我的一切
That's everything!

909
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,030
你想要來一片嗎
You want one?

910
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,230
緩解焦慮的
For anxiety.

911
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:28,400
沒事的
It's going to be fine.

912
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,320
好嗎
Okay?

913
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,820
你沒事的
You're okay.

914
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,300
他會原諒你的
He'll forgive you.

915
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,340
-不  他不會的  -他會的
- No he won't. - Yes, yes, he will.

916
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:36,550
上帝寬恕人們
God forgives.

917
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,870
我說的不是上帝
I'm not talking about God.

918
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,300
沒有人會想要垃圾
Nobody wants garbage.

919
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:48,220
我現在是垃圾了
I'm trash now.

920
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,530
不不不
Oh no, no, no, no.

921
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:53,430
好了  好了
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

922
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:33,170
但是說真的
But really?

923
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:34,590
-我和你說了...  -我覺得我一直
- I told you... - I feel like I always

924
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,780
在照你說的做
do what you want!

925
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,040
你看上去很好
You look incredible.

926
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:55,760
歡迎來到你的貞潔舞會  謝伊
Welcome to your first purity ball, Shay.

927
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,350
這將是一個難忘的夜晚
It's a night you'll never forget.

928
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,060
賽斯牧師
Pastor Seth!

929
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,340
她們很漂亮吧
Lovely, aren't they?

930
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,680
感謝大家今晚的到來
Thank you all so much for coming this evening.

931
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,470
你們看到這把鑰匙了嗎
You see this key?

932
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,370
這把鑰匙代表了你女兒的貞潔
This key represents your daughter's purity.

933
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,830
愿上帝保佑你好好保管
May the Lord help you keep it safe.

934
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,360
父親們  請來領取你們的鑰匙
Fathers, please come and get one.

935
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,040
但是你們要知道一旦領取
But know that when you do,

936
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,510
就相當于是宣誓你們將會永遠將這把鑰匙
you make a pledge to carry this key with you

937
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:41,780
帶在身邊
always.

938
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,450
因為你們的女兒無力獨自承受這重擔
For your daughter cannot bear this burden alone.

939
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,620
但是你不用永遠保管著這把鑰匙
You will not have it forever, though.

940
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,250
不會的
No, you won't.

941
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,380
在她婚禮的那一天
On her wedding day,

942
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,290
你將取下這把鑰匙
you will take this key

943
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:54,900
交給她的丈夫
and you will give it to her husband,

944
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,300
那將非常美好
and that will be beautiful.

945
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:00,590
外界有些人說
You know, some people out there say that

946
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:03,220
我們想要控制我們的女性
we try to control our women here.

947
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,140
但事實根本不是這樣的
That could not be farther from the truth.

948
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,680
不是的
No.

949
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,690
我們愛我們的女性
We love our women.

950
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:14,940
我們只是想盡我們所能
And we are just trying to protect our women

951
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:17,780
保護我們的女性
to the best of our ability.

952
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,360
多虧了像你們這樣穩重的男性
Thank you to steadfast men like you.

953
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,120
你不能離開
You can't leave.

954
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,670
你來這里干什么
What are you doing here?

955
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,500
我認識你嗎
Do I know you?

956
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:24,430
喬
Jo?

957
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,850
我到處在找你
I've been looking for you everywhere.

958
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,230
你沒事吧
You okay?

959
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:34,620
我沒事
I'm fine.

960
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,310
好吧  那你都去哪里了
Okay, then where have you been?

961
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,110
我要祈禱
I had to pray.

962
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,880
我知道不是你告發我的
I know you're not the one who told on me

963
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,150
對不起
and I'm sorry.

964
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,710
沒事的
It's okay.

965
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,280
我要和你說一些事
I have to tell you something.

966
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,220
凱爾和我說他之前不知道你的存在
Kyle told you that he didn't know about you

967
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,290
但他其實知道
but he did.

968
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,880
他一直都知道你
He knew about you the whole time.

969
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,350
你媽媽一直在懇求幫助
Your mom was constantly begging for help.

970
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:01,510
她總是和我的父母吵架
It was always a fight with my parents.

971
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,090
我應該早點告訴你的
I should have told you sooner.

972
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,300
但是我不...
But I didn't--

973
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,850
我不想惹他生氣
I didn't want to make him mad.

974
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,060
我想我們都還是希望我們的父親能愛我們
I guess we all just want our dads to love us.

975
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,810
這不是愛
This is not love.

976
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:22,860
大家注意了
Well, everyone,

977
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,630
讓我們歡迎今晚的
it's the time of the evening where we turn our attention

978
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,660
貴賓
to our guest of honor,

979
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,490
我的嬌花  萊西
my very own blossoming flower, Lacey,

980
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,910
這是她今年第十次參加
who is dedicating herself to me for the tenth time this year.

981
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:42,100
感謝上帝  感謝上帝  對嗎
Woo! Thank the Lord, thank the Lord, right?

982
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,770
她一次又一次地
She has turned away temptation

983
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:45,900
拒絕了誘惑
time and time again,

984
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,030
你們知道這不是易事
and you know that isn't easy.

985
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,940
先生們  看看她
Gentlemen, take a look at her.

986
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,240
你們肯定知道追求者
You know what kind of line I have

987
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,680
在我家門外肯定是排起了長隊
outside my front door, I'm telling you.

988
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,810
但是她這么做都是因為對上帝的愛
But she's done it all for the love of God.

989
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:00,000
她這么做  只是為了在她婚禮當天
She's done it all so that on her wedding day,

990
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,280
她能給她的丈夫最好的禮物
she can give her husband the single greatest gift.

991
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:08,300
一份能讓大家都知道
The one gift that will show everyone

992
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,740
她是上帝的女人的禮物
that she is a woman of God.

993
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,000
她的心靈和身體都是純潔的
That she is pure of body and mind.

994
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,250
她是干凈的  正義的
That she is clean and correct.

995
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,360
來襲  我每天都感謝上帝
Lacey, I thank the Lord every single day

996
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,070
你是屬于我的  我非常
that you are mine, and I love you

997
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,030
非常愛你
so very, very much.

998
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,090
我能說幾句嗎
Can I say something?

999
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,970
親愛的  我們沒有時間
Actually, sweetheart, we don't really have the time.

1000
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:39,740
終于到了  我們萬眾期待的這一刻
And now, it's that moment that we have all been waiting for.

1001
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,770
這也是我們本周末來此的原因
The reason we are here this weekend.

1002
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,040
女士們先生們  找到你們的位置
Ladies and gentlemen, find your seats,

1003
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,360
找到你們的契約  該簽署了
find your contracts, it is time to sign them.

1004
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,990
找到你們
I found you girls.

1005

希望你們跟著我說
I want you to repeat after me,

1007
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,750
但是記得換上你們自己女兒的名字

1008
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:58,910
我  萊西的父親

我  謝伊和喬的父親
I, Shay and Jo's father,

1012
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,190
在上帝面前選擇

1013
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,070
保護我女兒的貞潔

1014
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:12,490
我將成為一個正直  強大的人

1020
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:26,020
女士們
Ladies.

1021
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,780
請跟著我說
Please repeat after me.

1022
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,500
我  說出你的名字
I, state your name,

1023
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,630
向上帝  我的父親和我自己

保證將會保持我的思維和肉體的純潔  干凈和圣潔
to keep my mind and body clean, pure, and chaste.

1025
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,640
我  萊西
I, Lacey...

1026
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,100
凱利安  向上帝  我的父親

1027
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,020
和我自己保證

將會保持我的思維和肉體的純潔  干凈和圣潔
to keep my mind and body clean, pure, and chaste.

1029
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,060
我保證將會在步入婚姻之時
I pledge to enter the marriage covenant

1030
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,440
將完整的自己交給我的丈夫
prepared to give myself to my husband completely.

1031
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,650
我保證將會在步入婚姻之時
I pledge to enter the marriage covenant...

1032
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:58,100
將完整的自己交給我的丈夫
Prepared to give myself to my husband completely.

1033
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,060
并保證擁有一顆純潔的心

1035
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,080
阿門
Amen.

1036
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,250
阿門
Amen!

1037
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:08,920
父親們和女兒們
Fathers and daughters,

1038
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,990
請簽署你們的契約
please sign your contracts.

1039
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,720
在這里簽字  謝伊
Sign right there, Shay.

1040
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,730
簽在這里
Sign there.

1041
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:55,070
謝伊  簽字
Shay...sign.

1042
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:58,580
大家都為自己鼓鼓掌
Everyone give yourselves a round of applause.

1043
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,240
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1044
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:01,720
我們今晚所做的事是...
For what we are able to do here this evening is...

1045
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,620
你在干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

1046
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,790
爸爸  我要告訴你一些事
Dad, I have to tell you something.

1047
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,300
我不能簽署我的契約
I can't sign my contract

1048
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,880
因為我不是處女
because I'm not a virgin.

1049
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,190
我也拒絕以此為恥
And I refuse to feel shame about that.

1050
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:19,860
我覺得不該有任何人以此為恥
I don't think anybody should ever feel ashamed about that.

1051
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,680
所以才成功了
That's why it worked.

1052
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:23,180
儀式
The ritual.

1053
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,190
我也沒有簽署我的
I didn't sign mine either.

1054
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:28,940
我愛上帝
I love God.

1055
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,960
這承諾是我和祂之間的
This promise is between me and Him,

1056
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,110
這是私人的
it's private.

1057
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,790
他會對此很失望的
He'd be disappointed in this.

1058
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:35,290
凱利安  你太丟人了
KellyAnn, you're embarrassing yourself.

1059
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,250
趕緊坐下
Now, sit down!

1060
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,450
不  爸爸
No, Dad!

1061
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:39,620
是你感到丟人
I'm embarrassing you.

1062
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:43,410
我很為自己自豪
I'm proud of myself.

1063
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,960
我只想讓你也能為我自豪
All I ever wanted was for you to be proud of me too.

1064
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,130
你是我花園中的毒蛇  謝伊
You are a snake in my garden, Shay,

1065
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,440
我不會容許你的
and I will not allow this,

1066
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,140
上帝不會容許的
God will not allow this.

1067
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,600
你需要時間  謝伊  來禱告
You need time, Shay, to pray.

1068
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,480
你早就知道我
You knew about me?

1069
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:16,000
你一直都知道我的存在
All along, you knew about me,

1070
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,990
但是你根本就不想來了解我
you never wanted to get to know me?

1071
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,200
回答我
Answer me!

1072
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,510
你為什么要相信她  謝伊
Why would you believe her, Shay?

1073
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,560
喬是個騙子
Jo's a liar.

1074
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,390
你覺得你能糊弄我
You think just because you messed up with me,

1075
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:32,210
也能糊弄謝伊嗎
you get to try again with Shay?

1076
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:35,670
不可能了
That's not how this works.

1077
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,980
你是個懦夫  偽君子
You are a coward and a hypocrite.

1078
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,300
我和你的媽媽說她應該流掉你
I told your mama that she should get rid of you.

1079
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:48,640
這樣對我們家好
It would have been better for our family.

1080
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,940
你應該為你自己而感到羞恥
You should be ashamed of yourself

1081
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,820
你拋棄了我們
for abandoning us.

1082
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,280
我說我媽媽是婊子
You called my mom a slut?

1083
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,990
你像放逐莉莉絲一樣把她打入地獄
Banished her to hell just like Lilith?

1084
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,910
就像喬一樣嗎
Just like Jo?

1085
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,500
蓋布
Gabe.

1086
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:16,340
是杰克告發我的
Jack's the one who told on me.

1087
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,380
是他讓我惹上麻煩的
He's the one who got me in trouble.

1088
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,280
蓋布
Gabe...

1089
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,470
他是我們的人  謝伊
He's one of us, Shay.

1090
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:31,100
順便  你的確通過了測試  很勉強
You did pass that test, by the way, just barely.

1091
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,440
和你的姐姐不一樣
Unlike your sister.

1092
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:43,370
希望大家都看好了
Now, I want you to pay attention,

1093
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,260
因為現在這里有些女孩子
because, clearly, some girls in this room

1094
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,800
不知道怎么過好自己的人生
have no clue how to live their lives.

1095
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,250
她在這里  對嗎
She's here, isn't she?

1096
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,930
接納她  她要完成她要做的事
Let her in, she has work to do.

1097
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:53,330
-你在說什么  -拜托
- What are you talking about? - Please!

1098
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,400
如果我們沒有信仰上帝的這些父親
If we did not have these fathers of God

1099
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,900
指引這些女孩
to guide these girls,

1100
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,900
為這些女孩做好一切
to do everything for these girls,

1101
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,300
她們就會墮落
they would fail.

1102
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,730
看看她們
I mean, just look at them.

1103
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,940
她們如此渴望
They want it so badly,

1104
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:19,570
但是如果我們沒有這些上帝的勇士
but if we did not have these warriors of God

1105
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:23,380
為保護她們的貞潔
battling to protect their virgin souls

1106
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:26,050
她們未來命定的丈夫而戰
for their future righteous husbands,

1107
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,290
她們就會變成妓女
they would all be whores!

1108
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,790
萊西  你做了什么
Lacey, what did you do?

1109
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,100
當我們發現了她們的缺陷
And when we find a weakness in them,

1110
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,340
我們就要加以修正
we must fix that.

1111
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,510
可憐的孩子
Poor things.

1112
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:48,970
請保護我們
Please protect us.

1113
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,730
請將我們從惡魔手中救出來
Deliver us from this evil, please.

1114
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,360
她們根本不懂真正的珍貴
They have no sense of value.

1115
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:09,780
-她們根本就不尊重自己  -閉嘴
- They have no self-respect! - Shut up!

1116
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,560
-萊西  -我也沒有通過你的測試  爸爸
- Lacey. - I failed your test too, Dad,

1117
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,580
你知道嗎
did you know that?

1118
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:28,260
我在那個盒子里度過了那么長的時間
I've spent so much time inside of that box,

1119
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,560
我還是讓你失望了
and I still failed you.

1120
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:34,990
我知道我已經不好了
And I know I'm not really good anymore,

1121
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,140
是我搞砸了
I messed up.

1122
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,370
但是我不想讓你失望
But I didn't want to disappoint you,

1123
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,900
現在  我...
and now, I'm just...

1124
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:45,400
我很抱歉  爸爸
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

1125
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,830
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry!

1126
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:53,040
不不不不
No, no, no, no.

1127
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,290
莉莉絲  求你了  我是你的  我是你的
Lilith, please, I'm yours, I'm yours!

1128
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:57,930
你真的覺得我沒有你
You honestly thought I couldn't make

1129
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:00,090
就做不了任何決定嗎
a single decision without you, didn't you?

1130
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:02,920
我可以的
Well, I can.

1131
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,680
萊西  不不不
Lacey, no--no, no, no!

1132
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:10,140
萊西  趕緊把槍給我
Lacey, you give me that gun right now.

1133
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:15,180
不
No!

1134
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,450
崛起
Rise!

1135
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,620
歸來
Return!

1136
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:36,960
你就是審判
You are the reckoning!

1137
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,590
謝伊
Shay.

1138
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,050
不要
Don't...

1139
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,430
碰她
touch her.

1140
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,200
不要
Don't...

1141
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:17,450
教我們該怎么做
tell us what to do.

1142
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,280
你們認為我們
You believe that we

1143
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,300
比你們劣等
are less than you.

1144
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:39,560
