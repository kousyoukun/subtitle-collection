24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,330
I'm just fucking with you.

43
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,400
Larry, you coming or what?

44
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,000
I already made the reservation.

46
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,210
Well, I reserve the right to tell you to cancel it.

47
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,910
Stop.

48
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,570
Mom and Dad are here at the hotel.

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,230
Everyone knows how hard this is for you,

50
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,160
but we just want to see you.

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,190
Look, you're the only one that I want to see.

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Holy fucking shit.

53
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,930
Get on Cindy's Twitter feed now.

54
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,840
Oh my God.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,630
Some genius just totally flamed her.

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,580
Who the hell is ProgrammingFlaw, anyway?

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,730
- What?  -Someone needs to give that guy a medal.

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,650
Okay, so, you're coming, right?

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,930
I just-- I just don't want to.

62
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,370
Well, then I'll come to you then.

63
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,630
Let me guess: You're staying in some

64
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,970
flamboyantly vile place, right?

65
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,020
Tell me. Come on, tell me.

66
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,300
Ugh, fine.

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,980
I'm staying at the...

68
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,290
Pink Motel and Lounge.

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,230
Ooh, sounds so very.

70
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,630
I'll leave here in a minute.

72
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,630
Ciao, Lar-Bear.

74
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,690
Hello?

75
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:19,540
Hello?

76
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,090
Oh, man, I had you going there.

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,450
Yeah, man.

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,230
You got me good, that was good.

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,640
You got a problem?

80
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,570
What? No.

81
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,470
Yeah, you do.

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,430
XYZ
X-Y-Z.

83
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,090
- I can't believe you. - I'm just fucking with you!

84
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,110
April Fools, big boy!

85
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,390
That was a good one.

86
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,480
Let's try that again.

87
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,910
How can I help you?

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,970
I'm just looking to check in.

89
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,850
- Are you the owner? - Nope.

90
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,270
I'm Chester.

91
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,100
Uh, Larry.

92
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,200
Oh, hey, I'm Gerald.

93
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,080
You can call me Gerry, Larry, pleasure's all mine.

94
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,750
Yeah, um...

95
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,510
So can I just check in with you, or?

96
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,820
Yeah, I'm pulling double duty tonight.

97
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,540
It's off-season,

98
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,660
so the owners are cutting costs.

99
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,910
Can't stay mad at them.

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,770
They're real sweet old-timers.

101
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,270
Huh, I hear you.

102
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,800
Well, I've had kind of a long drive, so

103
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,040
just love to get to bed.

104
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,220
Oh yeah, of course.

105
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,820
Room's 75 bucks.

106
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,590
No tax if you've got it in cash.

107
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,960
Great, great, yeah.

108
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,020
It's an insult to leave a beverage a man's given you.

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,320
- Gerald... sorry. - Here you go.

110
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,010
It's common courtesies.

111
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,960
I mean, I can have... uh, sure.

112
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,560
Attaboy, attaboy.

113
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,320
Thanks.

114
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,430
Okay, what are we drinking to?

115
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,580
To the beautiful sound of laughter.

116
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
- Okay. - Amen, to the beautiful

117
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,830
sound of laughter, God bless you!

118
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,470
Now.

119
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,020
Chester, it has been great getting to know you.

120
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,220
Larry, nice.

121
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,060
I know.

122
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,830
I'll wipe that up.

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,920
Huh. Nice guy, huh?

124
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,630
Aw, he's a teddy bear.

125
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,690
Great sense of humor.

126
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,520
Oh, really?

127
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,940
So what are you in for?

128
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,270
Oh, just this family wedding thing, it's...

129
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,740
Oh. Those are the worst.

130
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,710
Maybe you'll get your bone buried.

131
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,400
Oh, yeah.

132
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,580
What's going on with you, man?

133
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,940
Sit down, come on.

134
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,140
Vent to Chester, sit down.

135
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,220
Uh, um...no, it's, it's...

136
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,410
I don't know, it should be fine, actually.

137
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,930
Wah, wah! Wrong answer.

138
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,400
No, I mean, it's just...

139
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,290
there's a lot of people I haven't seen in a while,

140
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,260
so that's...

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
There's more to it than that.

142
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,140
Okay, okay, um...

143
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,230
I don't know, I hate dancing,

144
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,010
first of all.

145
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,060
The food's always a letdown.

146
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,530
The food, really? Come on.

147
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,880
All right. I had to shell out 75 bucks

148
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,960
for cookie sheets because they were

149
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,670
the last thing on the registry.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Aw, cookie sheets!

151
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,440
Like Miss Piggy's ever gonna bake her own cookies, right?

152
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,790
That's, I mean... I'll tell you what, though.

153
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,530
I hope that she likes those cookie sheets,

154
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,940
because, honestly, they're gonna last

155
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,090
a lot longer than her marriage.

156
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,820
That sounds like a girl that you wouldn't marry.

157
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,630
Nah, marriage is just not my thing.

158
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,140
To lone wolves forever.

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,580
Yeah!

160
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,320
Yeah.

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,120
So I really am just really tuckered out,

162
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,360
- so could I get the key? - No sweat.

163
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,170
All I need is your credit card

164
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,650
and we'll sign you right in.

165
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,790
I already gave you the 75 bucks for the room.

166
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,110
Oh, I get it.

167
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,100
Tit-for-tat, right?

168
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,480
No, I'm just gonna need that credit card.

169
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,510
Are you serious?

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,790
Afraid so, man, I mean, I ain't operating a halfway house here.

171
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,490
No, I'm not saying that,

172
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,530
it's just that when I first came in,

173
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,660
you remember, like, a minute ago,

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,170
you said if I give you cash,

175
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,000
then you wouldn't charge tax?

176
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,830
And then, I took out the cash

177
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,120
and I handed you the cash.

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,020
I mean, that guy, that biker guy, he--

179
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,230
First of all, his name is Gerald,

180
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,230
and second, I never check in anyone

181
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,060
without proper paperwork for this reason.

182
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,350
I understand that, but this is crazy.

183
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,810
I mean, what are you trying to pull here?

184
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,600
Look, man.

185
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,830
You came in here, we had some drinks,

186
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,500
we had some laughs,

187
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,180
and if you want a room, that's great.

188
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,860
I'll just need a photo ID and a credit card.

189
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,750
All right, well, empty your pockets, then.

190
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,830
Excuse me?

191
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,430
You empty your pockets

192
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,410
and you'll see my money in there.

193
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,440
You put the money-- this is ridiculous.

194
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,590
I mean, do I have to call the cops?

195
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,050
Go ahead, call the cops.

196
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,180
And while you're at it, I got another idea.

197
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,110
Put out your goddamned hand,

198
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,070
because I got your room key right here.

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,710
Oh, man, you should have seen yourself.

200
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm just fucking with you, man.

201
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,150
- Oh, okay. - You should have

202
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,310
seen yourself, "This is ridiculous! Do I have to call the cops?"

203
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,250
- No, you know... - Sorry, man.

204
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,750
You want me to call the bellman?

205
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,440
No.

206
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,660
Good, because we don't have one.

207
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,470
Okay.

220
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,420
Take me, big boy.

221
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,100
Here's our viewer video of the week,

222
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,810
straight from Marshall.

228
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,770
That's right, Chuck, it is still chaos out here

229
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,570
on South Citrus at that multi-car pileup

230
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,390
that has caused gridlock in both directions.

231
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,160
Details are still trickling in,

232
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,460
but witnesses report seeing the pickup truck

233
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,520
swerving erratically before veering into

234
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,460
oncoming traffic, causing this chain reaction

235
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,670
which left one young woman dead

236
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,110
and several people in critical condition,

237
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,030
including an infant.

238
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,570
The driver, who witnesses say

239
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,520
was visibly intoxicated,

240
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,080
then fled the scene.

241
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,250
Sheriffs found the suspect's vehicle,

242
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,130
a late-model white pickup,

243
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,650
a few blocks away from the scene of the accident,

244
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,620
where it appears as if the sus--

245
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,440
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

246
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,460
Hi, you've reached Rachel.

247
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,970
I'm away from the phone right now,

248
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,200
but I'll call you back if you leave a message.

249
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,150
Where the fuck are you?

250
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,910
Hello, Pink Motel and Lounge.

251
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,200
Hi, uh, Chester?

252
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,460
The one and only.

253
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,080
Oh, um, hey, this is Larry in Room 6.

254
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,710
Yeah, Larry, I know who you are.

255
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,930
Yeah, I was just wondering if anyone checked in

256
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,930
since I got here.

257
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,480
My sister is supposed to come meet me,

258
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,390
and, I don't know, she's pretty late.

259
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,890
I don't know if she came in

260
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,670
or called, or anything.

261
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,270
Oh, well, uh...

262
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,960
no one's come in but let me check the messages.

263
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,430
- Maybe I missed a call. - Great, thanks.

264
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,870
Hey, Larry, I got some bad news.

265
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,060
Yeah?

266
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,900
It's about your sister.

267
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,070
There was a message.

268
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,900
I hate to be the one to tell you this, man.

269
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,590
She's not coming, Larry.

270
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,810
She found a big cock to suck on,

271
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,640
then she died and went to heaven.

272
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,790
What the fuck?

273
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,310
Come on, man, it doesn't even make sense

274
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,630
that someone would call me

275
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,010
if something happened to her.

276
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,760
Jesus, Chester.

277
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,680
Just call if you need anything.

278
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,690
Unbelievable.

280
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Let old Gerry help you out, buddy.

281
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,660
Thank you.

282
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,710
Did you just touch me, peckerwood?

283
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,960
No, no, I didn't, sir.

284
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,990
Yeah, you did, didn't you,

285
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,840
little man?

286
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,470
You know what this says?

287
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,650
No, sir.

288
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,020
Lone wolf!

289
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,480
Do you know what it represents?

290
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,080
- No. - It represents my armor.

291
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,880
And you don't touch a road warrior's armor

292
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,250
unless you're ready to fight

293
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,370
or fuck.

294
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,150
You ready to fight?

295
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,100
Uh, no.

296
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,940
Oh, no.

297
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,610
Oh. Well, cool.

298
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,930
You just narrowly avoided an ass pounding, dude.

299
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,760
Room 7 if you feel lucky.

303
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,450
I'm just gonna need that credit card.

305
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,620
"Do I have to call the cops?"

306
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,980
Big cock to suck on.

308
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,810
Lone wolf!

314
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,500
Very funny, Chester.

320
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,540
Rachel...

321
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,380
Hey, yeah, I'll be right there.

322
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,900
Hello?

323
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,270
No, I'm okay, just come back later, please.

324
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,260
No, I'm in the shower, can you come back?

325
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,900
Larry, you okay in there?

326
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,490
Chester?

327
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,100
Yeah, man, of course it's me.

328
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,900
Not all cleaning people speak Spanish.

329
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,710
That's kind of a racist assumption.

330
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,620
Listen, man, I was hoping to get to you

331
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,140
before you used the bathroom.

332
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,270
It's got a tricky door that's been giving guests

333
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,970
some problems, I meant to tell you this before

334
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,440
but we were having such a good time.

335
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,390
Just stop joking around, man.

336
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,220
What? No, come on, man, I like to joke around

337
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,950
but I wouldn't mess with you like this.

338
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,170
Just say that my sister is, like,

339
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,860
sucking a big dick or whatever and just let me out, man.

340
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,150
Larry, I swear I could lose my job

341
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,730
over something like this, man.

342
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,860
Sherrie and Johnny made it very clear

343
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,440
that I had to tell guests in Room 6 about this door.

344
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,950
You got to help me out, man.

345
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,800
Just let me out and then I won't say anything, okay?

346
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,870
All right. Geez, you're a good man.

347
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,070
Okay, I think‐‐ I'm gonna need you

348
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,710
to put a lot of pressure on the door.

349
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,470
What?

350
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,850
That is the oldest trick in the book, man,

351
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,760
I'm not gonna fall‐‐

352
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,680
Okay, I understand why you think that,

353
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,570
but I'm not fucking with you, Larry.

354
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,870
Are you putting pressure?

355
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,300
Yes, I'm doing it.

356
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,860
Okay, good, now you're gonna need a lot of leverage, okay, man?

357
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,060
You've got to really do it,

358
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,460
put all your weight against it.

359
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,860
‐ I'm doing it! - All right, just do it at the same time,

360
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,610
you ready, on three. One‐‐

361
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,880
Oh, man, we did it, buddy.

362
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,160
What the hell is wrong with you?

363
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,400
Okay, okay, I see you're not laughing.

364
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,910
But look at it from my perspective.

365
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,840
I mean, yes, I was holding the door shut.

366
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,040
Bad on me.

367
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,930
But honestly, I never thought you'd fall for it.

368
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,500
And once we were in the middle of it,

369
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,900
how could I stop?

370
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,370
Come on, man, it was just a joke.

371
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
It's me, Chester.

372
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,270
You are pathetic.

373
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,050
Do you know that?

374
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,610
Nobody likes people like you, you just‐‐

375
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,910
you never get the hint.

376
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,340
You just push and you push

377
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,610
and you push and you push.

378
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,150
Well, let me tell you something.

379
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,030
Nobody thinks that you're funny!

380
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,950
Just...

381
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,820
You don't think I'm funny, huh?

382
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,480
Well, what do you think is funny, then?

383
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,000
Come on, tell me a joke.

384
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,640
Chester, we're both tired,

385
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,190
it's been a long day, so can‐‐

386
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,360
Tell me a joke.

387
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,610
Come on.

388
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,670
What do you call a man with no body and no nose?

389
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,500
What?

390
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,340
Nobody knows.

391
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,630
That's a great one, Larry.

392
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,880
I knew you had it in you, Larry.

393
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,080
That was great, man.

394
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,590
‐ Okay. ‐ All right.

395
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,150
Have a good night, man.

396
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,490
Hey, Rachel, uh,

397
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,910
I don't know where you are,

398
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,840
but I've got to leave this motel,

399
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
it's just weird here,

400
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,400
and I don't know why you're not getting my messages,

401
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,530
but if you just want to call me back,

402
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,690
maybe I'll just wait in my car

403
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,380
down the road and see if you come by or...

404
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,820
It's just so stupid.

405
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,360
Just please, please, I hope you get these messages, and...

406
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,170
I'm kind of concerned you were in a car crash.

407
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,100
I hope not.

408
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,000
Aww, shit.

409
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,760
I really let things get out of control earlier.

410
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,130
I don't know what came over me.

411
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,040
You're probably a good sport, but you know,

412
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,240
you give a moose a cookie and he asks for milk.

413
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,260
I was asking for milk.

414
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,150
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah.

416
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,920
Well, I can't stop you from leaving, but

417
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,950
if you have to,

418
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,150
please accept my apology and part as my friend.

419
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,590
Okay, then.

420
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,230
If Rachel shows up,

421
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,220
I'll tell her you had to leave.

422
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,900
Enjoy the wedding.

425
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,900
How did he know her name?

426
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,950
How did he know her name?

427
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,090
911, what's your emergency?

428
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,840
Hi.

429
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,720
I'm at the Pink Motel and Lounge,

430
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,890
and there's the owner

432
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,310
or a guy who's‐‐ who's looking after‐‐

434
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,980
I need you to send someone out...

435
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,610
*honey bee*

436
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,830
*Guess there's nothing else to know*

437
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,910
*Except I love you so*

439
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,220
You know, so I'm in my car.

440
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,710
I had to check out because, I mean, he's been messing with me all night.

441
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,590
But he had said "Rachel," which is my sister,

442
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,680
and there's no way that he knows what‐‐

443
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,590
that's him.

444
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,140
That's‐‐ that's him.

445
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,310
Sir, can I talk to you for a minute?

446
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,310
Found out about my kiddie porn, huh, sheriff?

447
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,600
Aw, just kidding.

448
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
They're all legal, barely.

449
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,320
Don't even joke about that, sir.

450
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,190
How'd you know her name, Chester?

451
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,900
What are you talking about?

452
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,030
Rachel.

453
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,370
I never told you her name,

454
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,700
so if she hasn't been here, then how do you know it?

455
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,330
Because you told me her name, you dope.

456
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,420
I mean, did you seriously call the cops because

457
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,580
you forgot you told me your sister's name?

458
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,050
I...

459
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,390
All right. I'll handle this, sir.

460
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,670
Where's Johnny and Sherrie?

461
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,020
I'm just covering for them.

462
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,260
Step into my office.

463
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,570
All right.

464
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,310
Let's just calm down here.

465
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,850
I want you over there.

466
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,230
You, other room.

467
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,610
You and me gonna talk, sir.

468
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,430
So what can I do?

469
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,430
I mean, I'm just keeping the place open,

470
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,850
I can't be in charge of the crazies.

471
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,560
Right, well, listen, it's a full moon out here

472
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,680
so you're not the only one with crazy people tonight.

475
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,670
Sir‐‐ sir!

476
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,550
Please step away from there, that's private property.

477
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,720
Yeah, man, that stuff's confidential.

478
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,300
- No‐‐ look. ‐ I think.

479
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,020
This. You see?

480
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,260
That's her name right there.

481
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,850
That's her name, she's checked in.

482
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,520
Where is she, Chester, what'd you do with her?

483
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,850
Is something wrong, Larry?

484
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,320
‐ Huh, you see? ‐ Just relax and just‐‐

485
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,560
wait, why you making a fist here, Larry?

486
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,490
Oh! Oh, man! Ow, God!

487
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,320
What did you do?

488
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,690
I didn't touch him!

489
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,150
Sir, you all right?

490
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,820
I didn't do anything!

491
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,530
- Sir, are you all right? ‐ I didn't see that coming.

492
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,580
Sir, are you okay? What happened?

493
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,540
Larry. He hit me.

494
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,210
Did you seriously just punch him?

495
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,990
‐ Where the fuck is‐‐ ‐ Not again.

496
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,710
Sir, I'm gonna have to take you in.

497
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,670
Larry?

498
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,210
Rachel?

499
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,970
Larry! What the‐‐

500
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,560
Ma'am, stay there.

501
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,890
He's coming with me.

502
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,510
Officer, let him go.

503
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,640
It's my fault.

504
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,730
This man just assaulted you.

505
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,160
Oh, I... I pushed him too far,

506
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,320
I've been winding him up all night.

507
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,240
Quite frankly, I've been a dick and

508
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,960
I deserve a lot worse than getting sucker‐punched.

509
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,660
So you're not gonna press charges?

510
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,250
If anyone's guilty of anything here, it's me,

511
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,330
of bad taste and shenanigans.

512
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,010
You gonna behave, son, hm?

513
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,960
Yes.

514
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,520
Thank God he's okay.

515
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,470
Now, I don't know what's going on with you two,

516
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,940
but if I got to come back here tonight,

517
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,640
I'm taking you both in.

518
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,940
- Ma'am. ‐ Uh, goodnight.

519
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Is he giving you a hard time?

520
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
Yeah, he's been playing these jokes on me all night.

521
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,070
Larry, that was great, that was great.

522
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,620
What the hell was that about, huh?

523
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
Well, Larry was really worried about you,

524
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,030
and then he freaked out and called the sheriff,

525
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,500
and then I pulled this great April Fools prank

526
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,790
and got him to leave.

527
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,540
You called the sheriff on him?

528
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,830
Yes, I thought that he did something to you.

529
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,830
What do you mean, did something to me?

530
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,220
- I'm right here, okay? - Okay, well,

531
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,100
he knew your name, I didn't know that he‐‐

532
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,220
it's just...

534
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,600
Well, Larry, it's an online reservation.

535
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,770
You know, I had to put my name down to book the room.

536
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,810
It prints out by itself.

537
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,610
I guess I should do a better job of keeping an eye on that, huh?

538
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,400
Humph. Hey, relax.

539
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,730
This is...

540
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,190
Hey, relax.

541
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,030
Look at me.

542
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,350
‐ What took you so long? ‐ Oh, God, there was a big accident,

543
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,910
I got stuck on the freeway and I tried to do a detour.

544
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,840
Got really lost, and then I tried to text you

545
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,170
and it wouldn't send through.

546
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,250
We're gonna forget this whole thing ever happened, you hear me?

547
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,460
And you're gonna get some sleep.

548
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,420
Recharge and enjoy the room on me,

549
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,180
even though you sucker‐punched me.

550
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,050
I didn't.

551
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,480
You don't have to shake my hand,

552
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,510
we're way beyond handshakes, buddy.

553
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,900
And you could have a room for free too,

554
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,270
just for being so beautiful.

555
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,740
Wow, okay, I don't really know what's happening,

556
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,860
but I like it.

557
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,330
‐ I'm gonna go to my room. - Uh, wait, um.

558
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,950
It was really upsetting meeting you at first,

559
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,700
but you seem lovely now.

560
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,200
A common refrain.

561
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I wonder if this is actually him.

562
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,080
No, it's sexual harassment is what it is.

563
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,630
Ha ha.

564
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,350
I just don't think that he's funny.

565
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,430
Well, he could say the same thing about

566
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,800
you calling the cops on him, you know?

567
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,430
No, look, I mean, I kind of apologized.

568
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,270
Okay, maybe he's not as bad as I thought.

569
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,640
This wedding's really just messing with my head, you know?

570
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,940
I know. Here.

571
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,020
It's gonna be all right, okay?

572
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,570
And you should give Cindy this.

573
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,960
- Take it. ‐ Should we invite him to the wedding?

574
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,710
The Three Amigos?

575
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,950
Go away!

576
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,750
"Hey, Cindy.

577
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,630
This is my giant cocked friend Chester.

578
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,130
You cousin‐fucking bitch."

579
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,930
Go! Go get it!

580
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,690
It's Chester.

581
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,400
Well, open it.

582
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,610
‐ No, shut off the lights! ‐ He'll see, dude!

583
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,190
Maybe he'll get the hint.

584
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,110
We're coming!

585
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,500
Sorry for interrupting, just dropping off a couple drinks.

586
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,170
Thought you might need them after the night you've had.

587
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,380
On the house.

588
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,880
Have a good night.

589
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,920
Say thank you, he's going.

590
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,590
Um, hey, hey, Chester?

591
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,720
Thanks, man, this is‐‐ it's really nice.

592
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,650
And... listen,

593
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm sorry again about...

594
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,650
Calling the cops?

595
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,070
Punching me in the face?

596
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,110
Don't worry about it.

597
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,410
Okay. Uh...

598
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,870
Hey, why don't we join you for a drink?

599
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,420
Nah, it's late.

600
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,080
Come on, dude, just one drink.

601
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,590
All right, one drink!

602
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,130
Just one, though, not two.

603
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,300
Maybe nine.

604
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,640
I'm just fucking with you.

605
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,060
We could have 12 if you want,

606
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,220
I'm all set up.

607
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,510
All right.

608
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,220
You want to meet there?

609
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,480
- Aw, so you had to leave him. ‐ Yeah.

610
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,400
Hercules had to stay with our mom.

611
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,070
It wasn't very zen out there.

612
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,870
I was basically the least zen person in Tibet.

613
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,950
I've never been much for meditation.

614
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,370
I had an ex try to steal my mind once,

615
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,290
so I had to steal her body.

616
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,800
It was a joke.

617
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,710
Come on, guys, lighten up!

618
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,630
I just watched her dog last week.

619
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,760
She's a big bitch.

620
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,140
Dog was fat, too.

621
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,690
So are you ever serious, or...

622
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,850
Oh boy, the doctor's in.

623
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,980
Let me just lay on the couch.

624
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,860
I'll take two hand jobs and call you in the morning.

625
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,450
The structure of that joke doesn't even make sense.

626
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,650
Like, if I'm the doctor, I should be the one prescribing the hand jobs.

627
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,040
Now we're getting somewhere.

628
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,470
So what's this guy's deal, Rach?

629
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,170
Has he always been, you know, uptight?

630
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,800
Oh, you should have seen him when he was a kid.

631
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,390
He was the funniest, happiest little guy.

632
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,890
Couldn't go two minutes without laughing.

633
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,640
And everyone adored him.

634
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,350
So what happened to him?

635
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,700
Well, that Larry is still there,

636
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,320
it's just that I'm the only one that gets to see it sometimes.

637
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,530
Or maybe he's just an asshole.

638
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,780
Maybe.

639
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,420
Whoa! He got it.

640
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,790
Okay, you two.

641
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,170
I wish I had that kind of closeness with somebody.

642
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,880
So what is your story, Chester?

643
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
No story.

644
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,010
I'm just a good‐time guy.

645
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,140
A few drinks, a few laughs.

646
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,650
I'm a maker of cocktails

647
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,940
and a purveyor of jokes.

648
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,900
To be honest, I'm not fucked up at all.

649
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,030
To new friends.

650
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,590
*We'll be holding hands*

651
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,120
*Until the end of time*

652
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,300
This is a very special batch.

653
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, I can't do another one.

654
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,510
No, no, no, no!

655
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,770
So what's the real story with this wedding, man?

656
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,100
Uh... like, how do you mean?

657
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,650
You got a real heaviness about you.

658
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,740
Your aura is all fumbled.

659
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,280
Feel like you're dying to let something out.

660
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,580
Level with me.

661
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,960
It's just... it's just this girl.

662
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,590
What's her name?

663
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,340
Cindy Hughes.

664
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,930
She's the only girl I ever wanted to marry.

665
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,230
But she dumped me

666
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,360
the day before I was gonna propose.

667
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,780
And now, she's getting married tomorrow.

668
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,200
Who's she marrying?

669
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,330
You're never gonna believe this.

670
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,830
My first cousin.

671
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,090
You know, I keep wondering,

672
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,000
like, what's more humiliating to

673
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,310
to go and know that everyone knows

674
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,050
or to not go,

675
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,560
knowing that everyone there is gonna be secretly laughing at me?

676
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,060
What you need to do is have the last laugh.

677
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,280
That's the end game, man.

678
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,030
That's how the loser... wins.

679
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,370
You know,

680
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,130
actually I was thinking about doing something.

681
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,510
After Cindy dumped me,

682
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,430
I wrote the letter to end all letters.

683
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,400
Just never had the guts to give it to her,

684
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,640
but tomorrow,

685
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,270
tomorrow I will.

686
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,480
Right before she says, "I do."

687
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,780
Can I see it?

688
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,450
Come on, Larry, let me see it.

689
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,200
We're having a moment here, Larry.

690
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,920
Come on, Larry, let me see it.

691
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,830
You're never gonna see me again.

692
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,540
I'll tell you if I think you...

693
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,510
captured the right energy.

694
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,680
I've never let anyone read it.

695
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,600
Not even Rachel.

696
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,400
"Dear Cindy, words are really not my thing.

697
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,820
Cindy, I love you, I've never loved anyone..."

698
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,290
Ah, I love you, Lar.

699
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,040
That's fucking beautiful, man.

700
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,710
It's gonna crucify her.

701
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,300
What time is it?

702
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,060
Uh, I don't know, it's late.

703
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,690
Well, uh, bedtime for Bonzo.

704
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,910
Yeah, I should probably be getting back to the desk.

705
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,070
Who knows how many customers I've missed.

706
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,610
All right, good night.

707
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,070
Oh, wait one sec.

708
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,910
I need to get a picture of you, can you come here?

709
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,790
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

710
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,280
I look like a scrub muffin.

711
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,920
Shut up, you look amazing.

712
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,160
Smile, babies.

713
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,430
Okay, all right.

714
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,210
Good night.

715
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,090
That's a great picture of me.

716
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,380
But... just...

717
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,010
Good night, Lar‐Bear.

718
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,900
I love you, Larry.

721
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,490
What... the fuck?!

722
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,700
What the hell, come on, no!

723
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,830
Jesus!

724
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,960
Who would do this to you?

725
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,980
‐ Who is‐‐ oh, ah. ‐ Jesus.

726
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,520
- Oh, no, Betty! ‐ Who is this guy?

727
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,940
- He's just this biker guy. ‐ Betty, no!

728
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,610
It looks like Chester went too far this time.

729
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,200
Who would‐‐ who would do this to you?

730
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,200
Not‐‐ not Betty!

731
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,620
You goddamn son of a bitch!

732
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,990
Is there a problem, Gerald?

733
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,540
I swear to fucking Christ,

734
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,540
I'm gonna tear someone's fucking head off.

735
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh, someone put a crotch on your crotch rocket.

736
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,590
Did you do this?

737
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,470
You think this is funny?

738
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,970
Oh, at least you won't mix it up with anyone else.

739
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,640
Jesus.

740
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,490
- Not funny, man. - Guys.

741
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,780
- Fuck you! - Guys, guys, stop it.

742
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,730
- Who would do this? ‐ Can we just talk about this?

743
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,770
You want some of this, little man?

744
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,320
I'm gonna cut you up, man.

745
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,790
What's he doing?

746
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,670
Chester.

747
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,310
I... was... just...

748
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,720
fucking... with... you!

749
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,470
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

750
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,900
Gerald, are you okay?

751
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,950
Gerald, things got carried away, man.

752
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,320
Are you okay, man?

753
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,370
Are you okay?

754
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,370
You okay?

755
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,910
You okay, man?

756
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,500
Please, Chester, please.

757
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,460
You need to learn to take a joke.

758
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,340
Chester.

759
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,640
You okay, Gerald?

760
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,930
Are you okay?

761
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,100
You guys, I don't think he's all right.

762
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,240
Gerald, Gerald!

763
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,230
What happened?

764
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,610
Ｏh, no.

765
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,490
Oh, fuck, no.

766
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,240
He had a knife.

767
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,830
You saw, right?

768
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,290
He was gonna kill me.

769
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,290
Gerald!

770
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:55,960
He's dead.

771
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,670
I killed him.

772
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,470
Holy fuck, I fucking killed someone.

773
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,970
We have to call the police.

774
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,140
No.

775
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,490
Everything's gonna be all right.

776
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,440
No, it won't.

777
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,780
I'll take care of it.

778
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,030
What are you‐‐

779
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,610
what‐‐ what are you doing?

780
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,370
- No, no no no -- - No, please.

781
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,330
I'll call.

782
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,420
Once I make this phone call, it's gonna change my life.

783
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,340
Larry, can I ask you to do something for me?

784
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,510
O‐okay.

785
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,470
Will you go get me some vodka?

786
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,600
Some vodka?

787
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,810
Okay, okay.

788
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,600
One last drink before the long walk.

789
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,980
All right, okay.

790
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,330
Hello, Sheriff's Department?

791
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,370
There's been a tragedy at the Pink Motel.

792
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,960
My friend is dead.

793
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,630
It was an accident.

795
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,020
Holy shit, I can't believe what the hell is happening right now.

796
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,190
We have to call the cops.

797
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,680
Now.

798
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,060
He said that he was calling them already.

799
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,230
You think he really made that call?

800
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,910
I don't know. I don't know.

801
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,120
Give me your phone.

802
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,360
Give me your phone.

803
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,700
God, come on.

804
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,660
‐ Call, call, call, call, call. ‐ I am, I am.

805
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,420
9‐1‐1, what's your emergency?

806
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,960
Hello, hi, uh, yeah,

807
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,130
I'm calling from the Pink Motel and Lounge.

808
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,000
‐ I wanted to report‐‐ - Um, yes,

809
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,550
the sheriff's already on his way.

810
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,760
Are you currently in danger?

811
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,590
No, not this second, no, but, um, uh,

812
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,420
can you just make sure that he‐‐he's quick?

813
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,220
Yes, I'll let him know.

814
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,380
Okay, thank you.

815
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,590
I guess you were right, he, uh, he made the call.

816
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,760
What are you doing?

817
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,970
I'm‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm getting him that‐‐ that vodka.

818
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,140
What?

819
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,440
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

820
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,900
Looks like it's Johnny and Sherrie.

821
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,960
Now I know you're probably thinking

822
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,880
this elderly couple was horrendously murdered

823
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,830
in the motel that they owned and operate.

824
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,380
And you're right, they were.

825
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,050
But not by me.

826
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,140
Turns out Johnny here was a world‐class pervert.

827
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,980
I like to watch 'em fuck.

828
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,270
He had hidden cameras installed in every room.

829
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,810
Dumb fucks don't know I'm watching.

830
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,240
And he was getting away with it for years

831
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,320
until good old Chester came along

832
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,120
and realized that something was rotten in the state of Denmark.

833
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,530
I figured it out!

834
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,790
So I confronted him about it!

835
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,660
You're a bad man, John!

836
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,590
And when I did, Sherrie felt the years of betrayal

837
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,090
of not knowing that her husband was a pervert

838
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,920
and she took out a knife.

839
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,800
I'm gonna kill you!

840
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,590
And she started stabbing Johnny.

841
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,430
Not if I kill you first, bitch!

842
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,420
And he started strangling her.

843
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,430
And there they were, both of them,

844
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,680
intertwined in this... embrace of death.

845
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,970
Killing each other.

846
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,950
It was the most honest expression of marriage

847
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,520
I've ever seen in my life.

848
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,660
But you gotta believe I didn't have anything to do with it.

849
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,870
Do you believe me?

850
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,130
Yeah, I believe you, Chester.

851
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,000
Let's get you that drink, huh?

852
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,630
I knew there was a reason I liked this girl.

853
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,390
Shots all around.

854
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,940
Well, you're not gonna make me drink this by myself.

855
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,780
I was right.

856
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,950
What was it that Gerald said?

857
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,450
It's rude to leave a drink that...

858
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,740
someone poured for you.

859
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,750
Oh, by the way, you never told me your sister's name.

860
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,670
I looked on your Facebook page.

861
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,710
Run!

862
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,060
Fuck, my keys are in the room.

863
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,260
Mine too.

864
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,810
My room, my room.

865
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,350
Over here.

866
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,640
Oh my God.

867
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,140
Fuck, where the fuck are they?

868
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,370
How am I supposed to know?

869
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,740
- Fuck. - No!

870
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,160
Oh, shit.

871
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,130
Oh my God, oh my God!

872
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,020
No, no, no, no, no.

873
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:20,960
What are you doing?

874
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,990
What?

875
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,550
He's still there.

876
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,190
Oh, God.

877
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:40,900
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

878
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,070
Oh, God.

880
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,100
We have to warn the sheriff.

881
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,080
Fuck that, that sheriff hates me.

882
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,700
Sheriff, you have to help us!

883
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,750
Don't move.

884
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,840
What? No.

885
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,420
No, no, no, it's just us from before, remember?

886
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,690
The two of you on the ground now.

887
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,100
You don't understand.

888
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,250
He is crazy.

889
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,910
All right, you've got to the count of three.

890
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:32,950
One.

891
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:35,640
- Two. - Okay.

892
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,340
- Three. - Thank you for coming, Sheriff.

893
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,650
My God, sir, are you all right?

894
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,480
What happened?

895
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,630
She hit me in the head with a bottle.

896
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,630
Did you hit him in the head with a bottle?

897
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,420
Yes.

898
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,220
But... he killed those people in the diner,

899
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,970
aAnd he killed a guy, the body's just...

900
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,380
God damn it.

901
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:05,920
Oh, God.

902
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,850
I knew it was a bad idea not to take you in earlier.

903
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,730
Face down.

904
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,990
Right now, on the ground, now!

905
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,710
Officer, it wasn't us.

906
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,190
I'm taking you in for aiding and abetting an idiot.

907
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,290
Hey, hey, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!

908
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,560
Larry!

909
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,330
Stop it, stop!

910
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,350
Please stop!

911
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:39,850
What are you laughing at?

912
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,230
I'm just fuckin' with you.

913
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,220
That was priceless.

914
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:46,880
What are you talking about?

915
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,760
I mean, it took a lot of work to set this up.

916
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,380
I told you, he's a psycho!

917
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,550
Hey, shut up.

918
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,350
You're gonna get your chance, all right?

919
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,810
Sheriff, are you okay?

920
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,490
Are you okay, Sheriff?

921
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,890
Are you okay, are you okay?

922
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:08,030
Are you okay?

923
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,750
Sheriff, Sheriff, I'll help you.

924
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,440
You're okay, man.

925
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,950
Sheriff, are you okay?

926
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,030
It's okay.

927
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,380
It's okay, it's okay.

928
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,340
It's all right, it's gonna be okay.

929
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,140
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay.

930
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,200
Well, I never killed anyone like that before.

931
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,090
Larry, you gotta see this

932
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,350
Get up, Larry.

933
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,720
What the fuck are you doing?

934
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,810
- My bad. - Larry, Larry, get up!

935
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,630
- Larry, get up. - Well, Larry, I'm sorry.

936
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,360
This trigger's loose, man.

937
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,480
Leave him alone!

938
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,120
Stop it, stop it!

939
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,330
No, you stop it!

940
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,450
Leave him alone.

941
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,120
Larry, can I help you to the car, man?

942
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,790
Here, I'll open the door for you.

943
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:10,560
Larry.

944
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,850
No! Stop!

945
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,830
Now you.

946
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,490
Oh, God, please.

947
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,710
Bang!

948
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,090
Please.

949
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,000
No.

950
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,740
The surgery was a success.

951
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,940
Get the fuck away from me!

952
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,190
Get away!

953
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,590
Rachel, where you going?

954
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,730
I'm just trying to get you to the wedding on time.

955
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,730
You need your keys.

956
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,180
I'm trying to get you to the wedding on time.

957
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,380
Oh, God.

958
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,560
Larry, are you okay?

959
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,600
Oh, God.

960
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,750
Oh, my God.

962
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,250
- Go, go, go, go, go. - Oh, my God.

963
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,880
Go, go, go, go, go.

964
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,530
Go, go, go, go, go.

965
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,680
Are you okay?

966
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,490
Drive safe.

967
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,150
- Fuck you, Chester! - Go, go, go, go, go, go.

968
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:45,990
Oh God.

969
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,780
He's a fucking serial killer.

970
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:48,810
Oh, my God.

971
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,520
What the fuck is that noise?

972
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,560
What's happening?

973
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,830
Come on!

974
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,520
Oh, come on!

975
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,980
What the fuck.

976
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,750
Oh, God, oh, God.

977
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,300
Come on, come on.

978
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,330
Oh, no, come on!

979
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,900
Okay, okay.

980
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,080
Larry, get out.

981
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,500
Come on, come on.

982
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,210
- I got you. - Oh my God.

983
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,550
I can't believe it fucking worked.

984
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,570
Come on, Larry.

985
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,570
Oh, get up, Larry, get up!

986
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,440
I'm on fire.

987
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,210
Oh, God, Larry!

988
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:36,970
Go.

989
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,440
I'm sorry.

990
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,060
Hey, guys, wait up!

991
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,380
Go, go, go.

992
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,700
I'm sorry.

993
01:00:58,590 --> 01:00:59,970
What the fuck are you giving him?!

994
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,940
Laughing gas, of course.

995
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,640
No, no, no, no, no, don't, no, no, no!

996
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,020
Don't you fucking move!

997
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,230
No!

998
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,950
No! No, no.

999
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,650
One, two, three.

1000
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,200
Four.

1001
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,430
You fucking...

1002
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,950
- Five. - ...monster!

1003
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:28,730
One more is six.

1004
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,190
Get off me!

1005
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,580
*Hush, little baby, don't say a word*

1006
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,440
*Chester's gonna buy you a mockingbird*

1007
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,470
You should know by now, Rachel.

1008
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:54,290
I was just fucking with you.

1009
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,690
Am I dead?

1010
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,960
My friends, our guest of honor is awake.

1011
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:28,650
Ladies and gentlemen, Larry Adams!

1012
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,480
Larry, if you fall in,

1013
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,020
you're gonna drown.

1014
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,580
You can't move your arms yet.

1015
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,810
It's too soon.

1016
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,610
Just relax, my man.

1017
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,320
I won't be able to save you.

1018
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,560
I can't swim!

1019
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:44,930
Who are you?

1020
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,120
I am Judgment.

1021
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,340
I am Wrath.

1022
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,530
And you, Larry Adams,

1023
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,620
have been judgmented.

1024
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,580
- That's not a word. - How do you know, Larry?

1025
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,070
Do you have a thesaurus on that raft?

1026
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,670
I don't feel well.

1027
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,150
God help me.

1028
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,440
God is helping you, Larry.

1029
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,630
He loves you!

1030
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,800
This is the way He wants you to be.

1031
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,120
Welcome to my Hawaiian luau, Larry.

1032
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,310
You are my guest of honor.

1033
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,070
Here's your golden lei.

1034
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,770
Oh, God.

1035
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,400
Listen, Larry.

1036
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,390
I'm not gonna lie to ya,

1037
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,780
I gave you a mega dose of ayahuasca...

1038
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,000
and some other things.

1039
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,090
You're gonna be feeling a little woozy.

1040
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,460
You okay, man?

1041
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,160
Who am I?

1042
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,230
That's why we're all gathered here tonight,

1043
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,860
to find out who you really are.

1044
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,070
You're in a very safe space, man.

1045
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,270
I'm a trained shaman.

1046
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,830
Where's Rachel?

1047
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:48,030
Oh, Rachel's fine, man.

1048
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,020
She's just changing into her bathing suit.

1049
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:51,650
Perhaps we can go check on her.

1050
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,370
Let's put the ceremony on pause.

1051
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,760
Listen, Lar-Bear,

1052
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,250
there's one more thing I need for you to do.

1053
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:02,180
It's very important for your transition.

1054
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,860
Okay, what is it?

1055
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,620
You kinda fucked things up for me tonight,

1056
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,070
if I'm being honest.

1057
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,930
I had a fun evening planned,

1058
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,580
and then you came along.

1059
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,200
You're the rarest of things.

1060
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,320
What do you mean?

1061
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:23,760
Understand this:

1062
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,840
You're a man completely devoid of a sense of humor.

1063
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,020
You're a dour curmudgeon with a scorpion sting.

1064
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,850
You're the April Fool.

1065
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,740
I am.

1066
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,270
I know I am.

1067
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,930
I want you to tell me,

1068
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,720
in all your newfound, drug addled glory,

1069
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:51,810
who you really are.

1070
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,620
Tell me who Larry Adams is.

1071
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:58,370
Not the bullshit duality that you hide behind,

1072
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,040
not the mask you present to the world,

1073
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,570
but the real you.

1074
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,430
The real you.

1075
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,610
Okay.

1076
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,030
Good boy.

1077
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,340
What do you think?

1078
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,730
On the bed?

1079
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,590
I don't know.

1080
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,160
Yeah, on the bed.

1081
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,590
Sorry, I'm not much of a camera guy.

1082
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,440
Okay.

1083
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,640
Okay, I'm ready, I think.

1084
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,330
So, let the truth surge through you.

1085
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,260
Tell us both who you really... are.

1086
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:59,340
And action.

1087
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,390
I'm a troll.

1088
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:07,500
I...

1089
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:11,470
Literally, I'm a troll.

1090
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,110
I mean, on the outside,

1091
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:22,760
I'm I'm nice, I'm... meek,

1092
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:24,920
I'm affable,

1093
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,530
but on the inside,

1094
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:34,030
my heart is full of bitterness.

1095
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,270
I've never fit in.

1096
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,980
I'm on the other side of the glass,

1097
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,290
always looking in.

1098
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,290
This is fantastic, man.

1099
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,410
Let it out.

1100
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:51,980
Continue.

1101
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,150
You know, when I was young,

1102
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,430
I just...I never had the ability to talk to other kids.

1103
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,380
I never knew what to say.

1104
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,220
It's like I'm a prisoner in my own head,

1105
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,570
and it makes me hate people.

1106
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,280
So...

1107
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,960
I created ProgrammingFlaw.

1109
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,760
He could do all the things that I never could.

1111
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,630
I could be free.

1112
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,640
He can destroy people with a single push of a button.

1113
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,150
Sounds like a hell of a guy!

1114
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,310
Oh, he is.

1116
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,130
He's formidable.

1118
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,680
He's everything that I'm not,

1119
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,500
and he's the only one who ever had my back,

1120
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,900
Rachel aside.

1121
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,240
Thank God you have her.

1123
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,130
Deep down in my soul,

1124
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,190
I know who I am.

1125
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,530
So who are you?

1126
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,560
I'm ProgrammingFlaw.

1127
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:23,140
Scene.

1128
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,150
Lay it on me, man.

1129
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,200
We're beyond handshakes.

1130
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:52,090
You fully embrace the real powerful you.

1131
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,750
I'm proud of you, Flaw.

1132
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,450
You did it!

1133
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,670
Hey, can I see Rachel now?

1134
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,900
Here's the deal.

1135
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,330
For every action,

1136
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,110
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

1137
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,030
Newton's third law of motion.

1138
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,840
Rachel would call it karma,

1139
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,350
Larry would call it payback,

1140
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,740
I'll just call it fucking funny, man.

1141
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,730
Rachel, come on out!

1142
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,420
She's just in there.

1143
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:10,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1144
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,790
No, no, no.

1145
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,650
No!

1146
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:17,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1147
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,660
No, no, no, no, no!

1148
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,720
Rachel!

1149
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,660
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

1150
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,770
No!

1151
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,170
You said she was okay.

1152
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:39,980
You promised me.

1153
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,930
The transition wouldn't have worked otherwise, PFlaw.

1154
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,860
You wouldn't have learned anything.

1155
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,760
Why?

1156
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,920
Why not?

1157
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:12,690
You want to know what's even funnier than this?

1158
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:15,520
I just posted your pathetic confession

1160
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,350
and sappy letter to Cindy on the wedding forum.

1162
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,560
Comment highlights:

1163
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,430
"Pathetic note, bitch.

1164
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,380
Of course she'd never marry you.

1165
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,110
Get a life, freak.

1166
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,960
What's wrong with you?"

1167
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,140
"You're just really pathetic."

1168
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,830
Oh, here's a good one.

1169
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,160
It just says, "Die."

1170
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,290
And here's one from Cindy herself.

1172
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,190
Ready?

1174
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,440
"You are a monster..." ...A monster.

1176
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,320
I never even liked you. "You're pathetic."

1177
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,060
She really hates you, Lar-Bear.

1178
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:14,730
What?

1179
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,440
Do you know what?

1180
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:30,970
I was wrong about you.

1181
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,610
Oh my God, you are funny.

1182
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,860
I mean, I...

1183
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,810
I mean, I...I see it, man, I get it all now.

1184
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:46,390
All of this was genius.

1185
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:51,010
I mean, you're like Mozart, man.

1186
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,970
You're like the Mozart of comedy.

1187
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,190
I've been waiting all night for you to say that.

1188
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,540
You're hilarious.

1189
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,150
I mean, you're a funny fucker.

1190
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,630
I mean, those guys, Gerald and the Sheriff,

1191
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,900
what is wrong with them?

1192
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,250
They should've been laughing too, man.

1193
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,430
Oh my God, that dead couple?

1194
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,780
I mean, they just flat-out deserved it.

1195
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:26,190
Oh, wait, are you filming this right now?

1196
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,360
Oh, we serial killers like to keep souvenirs.

1197
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,730
PFlaw, you're a breath of fresh air

1198
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,720
in a slaughterhouse.

1199
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,300
But all good things must come to an end.

1200
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:48,980
Any last requests?

1201
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,890
I don't want to die here.

1202
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,720
I mean, I don't want to live anymore.

1203
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,390
I don't want to die here.

1204
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,390
Let's go to the wedding.

1205
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,270
All three of us.

1206
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,450
I mean, there's...There's a hill

1207
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:21,490
overlooking the festivities.

1208
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,420
I mean, imagine the look on their dumbass faces

1209
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,680
when we rock up.

1210
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,820
I mean, just me and Rachel, dead,

1211
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,850
just tumbling down a hill towards them.

1213
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,880
Now that...

1216
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,500
That would be fucking hilarious.

1217
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,430
Are you just fucking with me?

1218
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:50,790
You tell me.

1219
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,520
Where you going?

1220
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:08,590
Let's take Rachel's car.

1221
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,070
I'll drive.

1222
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,220
- You want to drive? - Oh, come on, Chester.

1223
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:19,130
Rachel would never let you drive her car.

1224
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:21,850
Rachel! Rachel!

1225
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,870
Would you let Chester drive your car?

1226
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,390
Rachel says, "No fucking way."

1227
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,210
Come on, Chester.

1228
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:31,400
Your aura seems a little jumbled.

1229
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:37,370
Look, man, I just wanted to say,

1230
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,750
thank you for everything.

1231
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:42,420
Keys.

1232
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:45,650
Let's roll.

1233
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,590
I'll fuck anything that moves!

1234
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,250
Or doesn't move.

1235
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,410
Sorry, Rachel.

1237
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,660
Rachel, do you have to pee?

1238
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:29,060
Chester, can I tell you a joke?

1239
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,830
Absolutely, man.

1240
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,600
So there's these two idiots,

1241
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,190
and they're driving down the road.

1242
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,340
And?

1243
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,620
Okay, and they're called Larry and Chester.

1244
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,280
And Larry's sister is sittin' in the back,

1245
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,410
woop, not sayin' a word.

1246
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,290
I like it already.

1247
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,000
Rachel, be quiet for the punchline, okay?

1248
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,990
And then Larry says to Chester,

1249
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,940
"If you could be anything in the world right now,

1250
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,600
what would you be?"

1251
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,590
And...And Chester replies,

1252
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,200
"Well, I don't know, what would I be?"

1253
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,260
I don't know, what would I be?

1254
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,600
"Well," Says Larry,

1255
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,830
"You'd be Rachel's dog."

1256
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,210
Rachel's dog?

1257
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:27,900
Yeah, that's right.

1258
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,430
Chester would be Rachel's dog, Hercules.

1259
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,170
Now Chester says,

1260
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,300
"Why would I be Hercules?"

1261
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,890
Why would I be Hercules?

1262
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,650
"Well," Says Larry,

1263
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,120
"Rachel just loved Hercules so much

1264
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,520
that she had him ride up front with her

1265
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,880
in the passenger seat."

1266
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,420
In fact, just right there in your seat right there.

1267
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,540
Oh, you're so thoughtful, Rachel.

1268
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,290
I mean, it wasn't exactly legal,

1269
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:05,430
but she just loved that dog so much.

1270
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,780
Almost as much as she loved me.

1271
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,720
She always wanted to keep him safe.

1272
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:19,330
So, she made an alteration to the car!

1274
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,080
What's the punchline, Larry?

1275
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,330
What's the punchline?

1276
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,290
Oh, Chester.

1277
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,670
The punchline is that because of Hercules

1278
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,600
Rachel disabled the airbags on one side of the car,

1279
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:45,380
Chester's side of the car.

1280
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,790
Now I'm gonna drive us into a fucking wall.

1281
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:52,960
You wouldn't, Larry.

1282
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,450
You're right.

1283
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,140
Larry wouldn't have the balls.

1284
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,730
But I'm ProgrammingFlaw.

1285
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,040
To the beautiful sound of laughter.

1322
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,320
I'm just fuking with you.
