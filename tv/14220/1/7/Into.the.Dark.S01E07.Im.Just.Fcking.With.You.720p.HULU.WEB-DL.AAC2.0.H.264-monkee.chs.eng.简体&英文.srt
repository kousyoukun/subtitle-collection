1
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,130
我就是在耍你
I'm just fucking with you.

2
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,270
Actually bought a hatchet

3
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,980
I don't sleep with a ratchet

4
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,900
I move drugs in batches

5
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,150
Hopped off that like hatchet

6
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,780
The bitch snatched it

7
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,370
Met her sister, smashed it

8
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,660
Fucked her once then dashed it

9
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,560
I'll take that machete to a mosh pit

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,900
I don't give a fuck

11
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,530
I don't give a damn

12
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,150
I don't give a fuck about you pussy motherfuckers

13
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,200
I'm gonna hit you with a stick like that

14
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,380
嘿
LARRY: Hey.

15
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,760
拉里  你到底来不来
RACHEL: Larry, you coming or what?

16
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,600
我已经预定了
LARRY: I already made the reservation.

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,150
行吧  我还是建议你别来
RACHEL: Well, I reserve the right to tell you to cancel it.

18
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,520
- 别说了
\ Stop.

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,900
爸妈都在宾馆了
RACHEL: Mom and Dad are here at the hotel.

20
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,280
我们都知道这很难接受
Everyone knows how hard this is for you,

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,660
但我们都想见见你
but we just want to see you.

22
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,410
- 听着  你是我唯一想见的人
\ Look, you're the only one that I want to see.

23
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,920
我的天哪
RACHEL: Holy fucking shit.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,550
快去看辛迪的推特
Get on Cindy's Twitter feed now.

25
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,670
我去
Oh my God.

26
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,020
有个天才彻底羞辱了她
Some genius just totally flamed her.

27
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,690
不过这个编程错误是谁啊
Who the hell is ProgrammingFlaw, anyway?

28
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,070
什么
\ What?

29
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,820
得给这家伙发块奖牌啊
RACHEL: Someone needs to give that guy a medal.

30
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,580
行了  那你要过来是吧
Okay, so, you're coming, right?

31
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,420
我只是  我又不想去了
\ I just\\ I just don't want to.

32
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,040
也行  那我去找你
RACHEL: Well, then I'll come to you then.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,420
我猜猜看  你应该在什么
Let me guess: You're staying in some

34
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,760
特别阴暗的小角落吧
flamboyantly vile place, right?

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,010
告诉我  讲讲呗
Tell me. Come on, tell me.

36
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,930
- 那好吧
\ Ugh, fine.

37
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,560
我会住在
I'm staying at the...

38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,690
桃色汽车旅馆休息室
Pink Motel and Lounge.

39
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,160
哦  听起来还真是
RACHEL: Ooh, sounds so very.

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,080
我一会就去
I'll leave here in a minute.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,700
拜拜了  大熊猫
Ciao, Lar\Bear.

42
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,360
你好
Hello?

43
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,310
有人吗
Hello?

44
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,350
天哪  是我让你去的
Oh, man, I had you going there.

45
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,740
是啊
Yeah, man.

46
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,370
你让我好过  那很不错
You got me good, that was good.

47
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,970
有什么事吗
\ You got a problem?

48
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
啊  没有
\ What? No.

49
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,130
不  你有
Yeah, you do.

50
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,890
X\Y\Z
X\Y\Z.

51
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,530
- 这事你都干得出来  - 我耍你的啊
\ I can't believe you. \ I'm just fucking with you!

52
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,540
愚人节快乐  哥们
April Fools, big boy!

53
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,750
这个有意思
GERRY: That was a good one.

54
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,890
再试试看
CHESTER: Let's try that again.

55
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,900
有什么要帮忙的
How can I help you?

56
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,910
- 我想登记入住
\ I'm just looking to check in.

57
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,030
你是老板吗  - 不是
Are you the owner? \ Nope.

58
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,040
我叫切斯特
I'm Chester.

59
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,290
拉里
\ Uh, Larry.

60
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,170
你好  我叫杰拉尔德
GERRY: Oh, hey, I'm Gerald.

61
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,050
可以叫我格里  拉里  很荣幸认识你
You can call me Gerry, Larry, pleasure's all mine.

62
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,680
嗯
\ Yeah, um...

63
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,700
所以  我能在你这登记吗
So can I just check in with you, or?

64
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,660
可以  我今晚负责这事
\ Yeah, I'm pulling double duty tonight.

65
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,670
现在是淡季
It's off\season,

66
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,380
老板在节约开支
so the owners are cutting costs.

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,260
也不能怪他们
Can't stay mad at them.

68
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,050
他们都上了年纪了
They're real sweet old\timers.

69
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,810
行  知道了
\ Huh, I hear you.

70
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,690
我刚开了一大段路  所以
Well, I've had kind of a long drive, so

71
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,530
现在只想上床
just love to get to bed.

72
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,280
当然当然
CHESTER: Oh yeah, of course.

73
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,700
房费75
Room's 75 bucks.

74
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,450
现金的话不用交税
No tax if you've got it in cash.

75
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,080
- 嗯  行
\ Great, great, yeah.

76
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,540
不理别人送的饮料
\ It's an insult

77
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,420
完全是种侮辱
to leave a beverage a man's given you.

78
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,480
- 杰拉尔德  - 抱歉  - 给你
CHESTER: Gerald... sorry. LARRY: Here you go.

79
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,610
这可是基本的礼貌
\ It's common courtesies.

80
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,450
- 我是说  我喝了吧  好的
\ I mean, I can have... uh, sure.

81
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,450
好啊  好小子
GERRY: Attaboy, attaboy.

82
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,250
- 谢谢
\ Thanks.

83
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,590
那我们敬点什么呢
Okay, what are we drinking to?

84
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,840
就敬这爽朗的笑声吧
\ To the beautiful sound of laughter.

85
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,590
- 行  -  干
\ Okay. \ Amen, to the beautiful

86
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,060
敬爽朗的笑  祝你们好运
sound of laughter, God bless you!

87
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,360
现在
Now.

88
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,990
切斯特  很高兴认识你
Chester, it has been great getting to know you.

89
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,250
拉里也是  很高兴
Larry, nice.

90
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,330
知道了
I know.

91
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,090
我待会去擦吧
I'll wipe that up.

92
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,040
是个不错的人  是吧
\ Huh. Nice guy, huh?

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,430
嗯  跟泰迪熊似的
\ Aw, he's a teddy bear.

94
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,630
幽默感十足
Great sense of humor.

95
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,140
真的吗
\ Oh, really?

96
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,780
你呢  为什么住进来
\ So what are you in for?

97
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,500
就是个家庭婚礼吧  它
\ Oh, just this family wedding thing, it's...

98
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,710
- 天哪  这种事糟糕透了
\ Oh. Those are the worst.

99
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,590
说不定能让你粉身碎骨的
Maybe you'll get your bone buried.

100
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,390
嗯  是啊
\ Oh, yeah.

101
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,770
你怎么回事  小老弟
\ What's going on with you, man?

102
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,400
过来坐下
Sit down, come on.

103
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,980
坐下  跟我说说看
Vent to Chester, sit down.

104
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,280
算了  它  就是
\ Uh, um...no, it's, it's...

105
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,870
我也不知道  其实还好吧
I don't know, it should be fine, actually.

106
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,000
打住打住  回答错了
\ Wah, wah! Wrong answer.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,510
我的意思是  这事只是
\ No, I mean, it's just...

108
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,300
有一群人我没见过
there's a lot of people I haven't seen in a while,

109
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
然后就
so that's...

110
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,140
不止这点事吧
\ There's more to it than that.

111
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,450
行吧行吧
\ Okay, okay, um...

112
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,030
我也不懂  首先呢
I don't know, I hate dancing,

113
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,450
我不爱跳舞
first of all.

114
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,170
东西也不太好吃
The food's always a letdown.

115
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,510
就因为吃的吗  不会吧
\ The food, really? Come on.

116
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,300
好了  我得再出75
\ All right. I had to shell out 75 bucks

117
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,890
买点曲奇饼
for cookie sheets because they were

118
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,640
毕竟这是能买到的最后一点东西
the last thing on the registry.

119
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,150
啊  曲奇饼啊
\ Aw, cookie sheets!

120
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,150
好像那某某小姐从来没有
Like Miss Piggy's ever gonna bake

121
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,400
自己做过曲奇吧
her own cookies, right?

122
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,660
我是说  我跟你说吧
\ That's, I mean... I'll tell you what, though.

123
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,290
我更希望她会喜欢那些曲奇
I hope that she likes those cookie sheets,

124
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,870
毕竟  老实说  曲奇
because, honestly, they're gonna last

125
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,800
都会比她的婚姻还长久
a lot longer than her marriage.

126
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,940
听起来那女的你不太会娶啊
\ That sounds like a girl that you wouldn't marry.

127
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,570
不是  我压根就不太会结婚
\ Nah, marriage is just not my thing.

128
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,580
敬永远的单身狗
\ To lone wolves forever.

129
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,370
干杯
\ Yeah!

130
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,800
我真的累得不行了
So I really am just really tuckered out,

131
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,390
钥匙能给我吗  - 别着急
so could I get the key? \ No sweat.

132
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,930
还要用下你的信用卡
All I need is your credit card

133
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,310
然后就能入住了
and we'll sign you right in.

134
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,700
不是已经付了75房费了吗
\ I already gave you the 75 bucks for the room.

135
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,710
哦  我知道
\ Oh, I get it.

136
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,710
那也不行啊
Tit\for\tat, right?

137
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,090
我还是得要你的信用卡
No, I'm just gonna need that credit card.

138
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,430
- 你认真的吗
\ Are you serious?

139
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,100
当然了  我可不是什么
\ Afraid so, man, I mean, I ain't operating

140
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,360
开过渡教习所的
a halfway house here.

141
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,230
不  我不是这意思
\ No, I'm not saying that,

142
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,090
只不过  我一开始进来
it's just that when I first came in,

143
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,450
还记得吗  就几分钟前
you remember, like, a minute ago,

144
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,120
你说如果我付现金
you said if I give you cash,

145
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,710
就不用交税了
then you wouldn't charge tax?

146
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,590
然后我拿出现金
And then, I took out the cash

147
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,840
递给你了啊
and I handed you the cash.

148
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,720
我是说  那个摩托手  他
I mean, that guy, that biker guy, he\\

149
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,930
首先  他叫杰拉尔德
\ First of all, his name is Gerald,

150
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,980
其次  我不会给任何
and second, I never check in anyone

151
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,990
没有合法证件的人登记
without proper paperwork for this reason.

152
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,990
这我懂啊  但这不合理啊
\ I understand that, but this is crazy.

153
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,620
我是说  你到底想干嘛
I mean, what are you trying to pull here?

154
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,630
听着  伙计
\ Look, man.

155
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,510
你进门  我们喝了点酒
You came in here, we had some drinks,

156
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,390
讲讲笑话
we had some laughs,

157
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,890
但如果你想找房间休息  那很好
and if you want a room, that's great.

158
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,770
给我张身份证和信用卡就行了
I'll just need a photo ID and a credit card.

159
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,740
好吧  那么把口袋里的东西都拿出来吧
All right, well, empty your pockets, then.

160
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,880
你说什么
Excuse me?

161
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,340
掏掏你的口袋
You empty your pockets

162
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,260
我的钱在那
and you'll see my money in there.

163
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,910
你把钱放在  这太荒谬了
You put the money\\ this is ridiculous.

164
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,660
我是说  要报警吗
I mean, do I have to call the cops?

165
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,170
去吧  叫警察吧
Go ahead, call the cops.

166
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,000
在你打电话的时候  我还有新主意
And while you're at it, I got another idea.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,260
伸出你那该死的手
Put out your goddamned hand,

168
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,010
因为你房间钥匙在我这
because I got your room key right here.

169
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,690
伙计  你该看看你自己
Oh, man, you should have seen yourself.

170
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,400
我在跟你开玩笑呢
I'm just fucking with you, man.

171
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,450
- 好吧  - 你该
\ Oh, okay. \ You should have

172
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,950
看看你自己  这太荒谬了
seen yourself, "This is ridiculous!

173
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,710
我要叫警察吗
Do I have to call the cops?"

174
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,080
- 不  你知道  - 对不起
\ No, you know... - Sorry, man.

175
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,670
你要我打电话给行李员吗
You want me to call the bellman?

176
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,070
不用了
No.

177
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,010
行吧  看毕竟我们也没有
Good, because we don't have one.

178
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,430
好的
Okay.

179
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,360
带我走吧
Take me, big boy.

180
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,980
这是本周从马歇尔直播
Here's our viewer video of the week,

181
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,360
的记者视频
straight from Marshall.

182
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,260
没错  查克  外面依然一片混乱
That's right, Chuck, it is still chaos out here

183
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,100
在南部柑橘区发生了多车相撞事件
on South Citrus at that multi\car pileup

184
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,770
这导致了两个方向的交通堵塞
that has caused gridlock in both directions.

185
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,900
具体细节还在调查
Details are still trickling in,

186
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
但有目击者称小货车
but witnesses report seeing the pickup truck

187
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,030
在转向前发生了不寻常的
swerving erratically before veering into

188
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,040
摇摆  导致了连锁反应
oncoming traffic, causing this chain reaction

189
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,290
一位年轻女士死亡
which left one young woman dead

190
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,010
有多人受重伤
and several people in critical condition,

191
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,800
其中包括一个婴儿
including an infant.

192
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,560
目击者说司机
The driver, who witnesses say

193
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,020
明显是酒驾
was visibly intoxicated,

194
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,900
然后逃离了现场
then fled the scene.

195
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,020
警方发现了嫌疑犯的车
Sheriffs found the suspect's vehicle,

196
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,820
是一辆新款白色小卡车
a late\model white pickup,

197
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,410
距离事故现场只有几个街区
a few blocks away from the scene of the accident,

198
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,040
看起来嫌疑犯
where it appears as if the sus\\

199
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,270
快点  快点  快点
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

200
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,190
你好  我是瑞秋
Hi, you've reached Rachel.

201
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,690
现在我接不了电话
I'm away from the phone right now,

202
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,950
你留言的话我会打给你的
but I'll call you back if you leave a message.

203
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,590
你在哪呢
Where the fuck are you?

204
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,860
你好  这里是粉红招待所
Hello, Pink Motel and Lounge.

205
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,370
你好  是切斯特吗
Hi, uh, Chester?

206
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,500
如假包换
The one and only.

207
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,170
我是6号房间的拉里
Oh, um, hey, this is Larry in Room 6.

208
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,340
拉里啊  我知道你是谁
Yeah, Larry, I know who you are.

209
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,690
我只是好奇是否有人在我来这之后
Yeah, I was just wondering if anyone checked in

210
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,610
登记了
since I got here.

211
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,230
我妹妹应该来见我的
My sister is supposed to come meet me,

212
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,110
我不知道什么情况  她还没到
and, I don't know, she's pretty late.

213
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,700
我不知道她有没有来这
I don't know if she came in

214
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,500
或者打电话什么的
or called, or anything.

215
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,630
这个
Oh, well, uh...

216
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,760
没人来  我去看看留言
no one's come in but let me check the messages.

217
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,270
- 可能我忘了接电话  - 好的  谢谢你
\ Maybe I missed a call. \ Great, thanks.

218
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,630
拉里  我有坏消息告诉你
Hey, Larry, I got some bad news.

219
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,510
什么
Yeah?

220
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,520
关于你妹妹的
It's about your sister.

221
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,150
有条消息
There was a message.

222
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,870
我不想告诉你这些的
I hate to be the one to tell you this, man.

223
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,460
她不会来了拉里
She's not coming, Larry.

224
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,600
她找了一大爬次
She found a big cock to suck on,

225
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,610
然后她死了升天了
then she died and went to heaven.

226
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,990
什么鬼
What the fuck?

227
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,240
摆脱伙计  要是她出了什么事
Come on, man, it doesn't even make sense

228
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,450
讲道理没人会
that someone would call me

229
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,580
给我打电话吧
if something happened to her.

230
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,670
天啊  切斯特
Jesus, Chester.

231
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,470
有什么需要打电话给我
Just call if you need anything.

232
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,080
真是难以置信
Unbelievable.

233
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,340
让老格里帮帮你吧  伙计
Let old Gerry help you out, buddy.

234
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,770
谢谢
Thank you.

235
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,610
你刚是碰我了吗  小弱鸡
Did you just touch me, peckerwood?

236
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,780
没  没  我没有  先生
No, no, I didn't, sir.

237
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,990
是的  你碰我了  不是吗
Yeah, you did, didn't you,

238
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,120
小伙计
little man?

239
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,300
你知道这上面写的什么吗
You know what this says?

240
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,800
不知道  先生
No, sir.

241
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,930
独狼
Lone wolf!

242
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,150
知道它代表什么吗
Do you know what it represents?

243
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,950
- 不知道  - 它代表我的盔甲
\ No. \ It represents my armor.

244
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,170
你不能碰马路战士的盔甲
And you don't touch a road warrior's armor

245
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,130
除非你准备要战斗
unless you're ready to fight

246
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,770
或者大干一场
or fuck.

247
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,140
准备要打一架了吗
You ready to fight?

248
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,400
这个  没有
Uh, no.

249
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,410
没有
Oh, no.

250
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,950
行吧
Oh. Well, cool.

251
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,350
你刚刚勉强免遭一场暴揍  伙计
You just narrowly avoided an ass pounding, dude.

252
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,230
要是觉得可以走运  那就来7号房
Room 7 if you feel lucky.

253
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,380
我只需要那张信用卡
I'm just gonna need that credit card.

254
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,590
我要报警吗
"Do I have to call the cops?"

255
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,880
有大盼
Big cock to suck on.

256
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,260
独狼
Lone wolf!

257
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,180
真有意思  切斯特
Very funny, Chester.

258
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,200
瑞秋
Rachel...

259
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,870
我马上来
Hey, yeah, I'll be right there.

260
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,380
谁啊
Hello?

261
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,140
我没事  拜托你过会再来吧
No, I'm okay, just come back later, please.

262
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,150
不行  我洗澡呢  你能一会再回来吗
No, I'm in the shower, can you come back?

263
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,370
拉里  你还好吗
Larry, you okay in there?

264
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,620
切斯特吗
Chester?

265
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,170
是啊  伙计  当然是我了
Yeah, man, of course it's me.

266
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,800
不是所有的清洁工人都说西班牙语
Not all cleaning people speak Spanish.

267
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,010
这是种族歧视的言论
That's kind of a racist assumption.

268
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,180
听着  我本 想在你去浴室之前
Listen, man, I was hoping to get to you

269
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,930
能找到你
before you used the bathroom.

270
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,690
这个破门给客人们带来了
It's got a tricky door that's been giving guests

271
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,560
一些问题  我之前就想告诉你的
some problems, I meant to tell you this before

272
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,030
但我们玩得太开心了
but we were having such a good time.

273
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,410
别再开玩笑了  伙计
Just stop joking around, man.

274
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,700
什么  不是  拜托伙计  我喜欢开玩笑
What? No, come on, man, I like to joke around

275
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,540
但我不会这么玩弄你的
but I wouldn't mess with you like this.

276
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,170
就像你说我妹妹
Just say that my sister is, like,

277
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,380
吸着大攀裁吹  放我出去
sucking a big dick or whatever and just let me out, man.

278
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,640
拉里  我发誓我因为这种事情
Larry, I swear I could lose my job

279
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,560
会丢了工作的
over something like this, man.

280
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,400
雪莉和约翰尼说的很清楚
Sherrie and Johnny made it very clear

281
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,070
我得把这门的情况告诉6号房间的客人
that I had to tell guests in Room 6 about this door.

282
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,820
你得帮帮我
You got to help me out, man.

283
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,700
让我出去然后我什么都不会说  好吗
Just let me out and then I won't say anything, okay?

284
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,830
好吧  天啊  你真是个好人
All right. Geez, you're a good man.

285
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,710
我觉得  我需要你
Okay, I think\\ I'm gonna need you

286
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,590
非常使劲地推门
to put a lot of pressure on the door.

287
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,970
什么
What?

288
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,810
这是书上最古老的把戏
That is the oldest trick in the book, man,

289
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,310
我是不会
I'm not gonna fall\\

290
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,850
好吧  我理解你为什么这么想
Okay, I understand why you think that,

291
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,570
但我没跟你开玩笑  拉里
but I'm not fucking with you, Larry.

292
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,940
你在使劲吗
Are you putting pressure?

293
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,610
是啊  我在推
Yes, I'm doing it.

294
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,950
很好  现在你需要杠杆作用
Okay, good, now you're gonna need a lot of leverage,

295
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,120
好吗
okay, man?

296
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,080
你得真的使劲
You've got to really do it,

297
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,250
把你所有的力气都使在上面
put all your weight against it.

298
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,960
- 我在使劲了  - 好的
\ I'm doing it! - All right, just do it

299
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,800
同时进行  你准备好  我数三声
at the same time, you ready, on three.

300
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,220
一
One\\

301
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,320
我们成功了  伙计
Oh, man, we did it, buddy.

302
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,860
你这个人到底什么毛病
What the hell is wrong with you?

303
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,240
好吧  好吧  我没看见你笑
Okay, okay, I see you're not laughing.

304
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,950
但是从我的角度看
But look at it from my perspective.

305
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,620
我是说  没错  是我把门按住了
I mean, yes, I was holding the door shut.

306
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,130
是我不好
Bad on me.

307
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,680
但老实说  我没想过你会上当
But honestly, I never thought you'd fall for it.

308
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,760
我们玩笑都开到一半了
And once we were in the middle of it,

309
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,470
我怎么能停呢
how could I stop?

310
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,150
拜托  伙计  这只是个玩笑
Come on, man, it was just a joke.

311
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,790
我是切斯特啊
It's me, Chester.

312
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,000
你真可悲
You are pathetic.

313
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
你知道吗
Do you know that?

314
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,710
没人喜欢你  你不过是
Nobody likes people like you, you just\\

315
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,750
你从来看不懂别人的暗示
you never get the hint.

316
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,960
你就会说让你推  再推
You just push and you push

317
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,010
再推  再推
and you push and you push.

318
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,140
让我来告诉你
Well, let me tell you something.

319
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,770
没人觉得你有意思
Nobody thinks that you're funny!

320
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,610
不过是
Just...

321
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,920
你觉得我没意思是吧
You don't think I'm funny, huh?

322
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,310
那你觉得什么是有意思
Well, what do you think is funny, then?

323
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,570
来  给我说个笑话来
Come on, tell me a joke.

324
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,450
切斯特  我们都累了
Chester, we're both tired,

325
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,040
今天都不容易  我们能不能
it's been a long day, so can\\

326
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,540
给我说个笑话
Tell me a joke.

327
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,670
算了吧
Come on.

328
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,940
一个人没有身体没有鼻子  他是什么
What do you call a man with no body and no nose?

329
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,540
是什么
What?

330
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,590
没人知道(没有身体鼻子)
Nobody knows.

331
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,860
这个笑话真好笑  拉里
That's a great one, Larry.

332
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,360
我就知道你有幽默感的  拉里
I knew you had it in you, Larry.

333
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,120
这个笑话不错
That was great, man.

334
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,750
- 行了  - 行吧
\ Okay. \ All right.

335
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,250
睡个好觉
Have a good night, man.

336
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,840
嗨  瑞秋
Hey, Rachel, uh,

337
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,100
我不知道你在哪
I don't know where you are,

338
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,560
但我必须要离开这个旅店
but I've got to leave this motel,

339
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,850
这太奇怪了
it's just weird here,

340
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,110
而且我不知道你为什么没有收到我的信息
and I don't know why you're not getting my messages,

341
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,240
但如果你想给我打回来
but if you just want to call me back,

342
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,370
也许我会在路尽头的
maybe I'll just wait in my car

343
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,370
车里等你  看你是不是过来或者
down the road and see if you come by or...

344
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,210
这太蠢了
It's just so stupid.

345
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,340
拜托  我希望你收到这个消息
Just please, please, I hope you get these messages, and...

346
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,140
我有点担心你出车祸了
I'm kind of concerned you were in a car crash.

347
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,470
我希望不会
I hope not.

348
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,000
见鬼
Aww, shit.

349
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,220
我之前真的让事态失控了
I really let things get out of control earlier.

350
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,010
我不知道我是怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

351
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,730
你也许是个好人  但你知道吗
You're probably a good sport, but you know,

352
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,820
有的人就是得寸进尺
you give a moose a cookie and he asks for milk.

353
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,160
我就是得寸进尺了
I was asking for milk.

354
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,750
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

355
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,630
是的
Yeah.

356
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,050
我没法阻止你离开  但是
Well, I can't stop you from leaving, but

357
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,260
如果你一定要离开
if you have to,

358
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,190
请作为朋友一样接受我的道歉和分别
please accept my apology and part as my friend.

359
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,790
好吧
Okay, then.

360
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,800
如果瑞秋过来了
If Rachel shows up,

361
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,890
我会告诉她你非要走
I'll tell her you had to leave.

362
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,530
享受婚礼去吧
Enjoy the wedding.

363
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,500
他怎么知道她的名字
How did he know her name?

364
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,130
他怎么知道她的名字
How did he know her name?

365
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,160
这里是911  请问有什么需要帮助的
911, what's your emergency?

366
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,620
你好
Hi.

367
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,000
我在粉红汽车旅店这
I'm at the Pink Motel and Lounge,

368
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,720
这的店主
and there's the owner

369
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,890
或者说是看管着的人
or a guy who's\\ who's looking after\\

370
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,980
我需要你派人来
I need you to send someone out...

371
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,130
小可人 *
* Honey bee

372
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,180
我猜没人会知道 *
* Guess there's nothing else to know

373
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,020
除了我如此的爱你 *
* Except I love you so

374
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,440
你知道  我一直在我的车里
You know, so I'm in my car.

375
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,450
我必须要退房  因为他一整晚
I had to check out because, I mean, he's been messing

376
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,280
都在打扰我
with me all night.

377
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,040
但是他刚刚说了瑞秋  那是我妹妹
But he had said "Rachel," which is my sister,

378
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,550
而且他不可能知道
and there's no way that he knows what\\

379
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,300
就是他
that's him.

380
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,260
就是  就是他
That's\\ that's him.

381
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,440
先生  我可以跟你聊几句吗
Sir, can I talk to you for a minute?

382
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,320
找到我的儿童色情片了  是吧  警长
Found out about my kiddie porn, huh, sheriff?

383
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,530
我开玩笑的
Aw, just kidding.

384
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,580
这都是合法的  差不多吧
They're all legal, barely.

385
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,330
不要拿这个开玩笑  先生
Don't even joke about that, sir.

386
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,580
你是怎么知道她名字的  切斯特
How'd you know her name, Chester?

387
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,920
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

388
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,800
瑞秋
Rachel.

389
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,960
我没告诉过你她名字
I never told you her name,

390
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,220
如果她没来过这  那么你是怎么知道的
so if she hasn't been here, then how do you know it?

391
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,480
因为你告诉过我她的名字了  你个傻帽
Because you told me her name, you dope.

392
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,110
我说  因为你忘了你告诉过我你妹妹的名字
I mean, did you seriously call the cops because

393
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,110
你还真给警察打电话啊
you forgot you told me your sister's name?

394
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,330
我
I...

395
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,250
好吧  我来处理这件事  先生
All right. I'll handle this, sir.

396
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,590
约翰尼和雪莉呢
Where's Johnny and Sherrie?

397
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,960
我就是在帮他们看店
I'm just covering for them.

398
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,840
来我的办公室吧
Step into my office.

399
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,480
好吧
All right.

400
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,310
咱们都冷静下来
Let's just calm down here.

401
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,820
我需要你站在那
I want you over there.

402
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,990
你去另一间屋子
You, other room.

403
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,620
你跟我要聊一下  先生
You and me gonna talk, sir.

404
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,040
我能为你做些什么
So what can I do?

405
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
我只是想让这里继续营业
I mean, I'm just keeping the place open,

406
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,960
我可不想被指控这里有疯子
I can't be in charge of the crazies.

407
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,260
好吧  今天是月圆之夜
Right, well, listen, it's a full moon out here

408
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,720
所以你不会是今晚唯一一个遇见疯子的人
so you're not the only one with crazy people tonight.

409
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,530
先生  先生
Sir\\ sir!

410
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,450
请从那离开  那是私人物品
Please step away from there, that's private property.

411
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,580
是啊  哥们  那是机密文件
Yeah, man, that stuff's confidential.

412
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,580
不  你看  我认为
No\\ look. \ I think.

413
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,880
这里  看见了吗
This. You see?

414
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,050
她名字就在这
That's her name right there.

415
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,260
那就是她的名字  她住过这里
That's her name, she's checked in.

416
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,300
她在哪  切斯特  你对她做了什么
Where is she, Chester, what'd you do with her?

417
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,890
有什么问题吗  拉里
Is something wrong, Larry?

418
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,140
- 你没看见吗  - 放松
\ Huh, you see? \ Just relax and just\\

419
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,190
慢着  你干嘛握着拳头  拉里
wait, why you making a fist here, Larry?

420
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,070
哦  我的天呐
Oh! Oh, man! Ow, God!

421
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,160
你做了什么
What did you do?

422
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,950
我根本没碰他
I didn't touch him!

423
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,080
先生  你没事吧
Sir, you all right?

424
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,540
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything!

425
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,670
- 先生你没事吧  - 我没看见他挥拳过来
- Sir, are you all right? \ I didn't see that coming.

426
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,470
先生  你没事吧  发生了什么
Sir, are you okay? What happened?

427
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,470
拉里  他打了我
Larry. He hit me.

428
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,350
你真的动手打他了吗
Did you seriously just punch him?

429
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,930
- 她在哪  - 绝不会让你再这么做了
\ Where the fuck is\\ \ Not again.

430
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,730
先生  我必须把你带到局里去
Sir, I'm gonna have to take you in.

431
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,230
拉里
Larry?

432
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,370
瑞秋
Rachel?

433
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,040
拉里  什么
Larry! What the\\

434
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,340
女士  待在那
Ma'am, stay there.

435
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,280
他必须跟我走
He's coming with me.

436
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,310
警官  放开他吧
Officer, let him go.

437
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,980
是我的错
It's my fault.

438
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,950
这个人刚才攻击了你
This man just assaulted you.

439
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,950
是我逼他的
Oh, I... I pushed him too far,

440
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,750
我一整晚都一直在烦他
I've been winding him up all night.

441
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,380
坦白说  我一直是个混蛋
Quite frankly, I've been a dick and

442
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,640
我挨这一拳算是轻的
I deserve a lot worse than getting sucker\punched.

443
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,760
所以你不准备起诉他了
So you're not gonna press charges?

444
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,850
如果这里非要给人定罪  那个人就是我
If anyone's guilty of anything here, it's me,

445
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,860
恶品味和恶作剧
of bad taste and shenanigans.

446
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
你要表现得老实点
You gonna behave, son, hm?

447
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,870
是的
Yes.

448
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,510
谢天谢地他没事
Thank God he's okay.

449
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,700
我不知道你俩发生了什么
Now, I don't know what's going on with you two,

450
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,850
但如果我今晚再来这
but if I got to come back here tonight,

451
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,350
我就要把你俩都抓进去
I'm taking you both in.

452
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,490
- 走了  女士  - 嗯  晚安
- Ma'am. \ Uh, goodnight.

453
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,240
他让你不好受了吗
Is he giving you a hard time?

454
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,030
是啊  他一整我都在开我的玩笑
Yeah, he's been playing these jokes on me all night.

455
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,410
拉里  那挺好的  挺好的
Larry, that was great, that was great.

456
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,170
刚才是怎么回事
What the hell was that about, huh?

457
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,670
拉里一直在担心你
Well, Larry was really worried about you,

458
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,920
然后他吓坏了  打电话报警了
and then he freaked out and called the sheriff,

459
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,260
然后我搞了个愚人节恶作剧
and then I pulled this great April Fools prank

460
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,930
- 让他离开了  - 等等  慢着
- and got him to leave. \ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

461
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,690
你报警说他有问题
You called the sheriff on him?

462
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,020
是的  我以为他对你做了什么
Yes, I thought that he did something to you.

463
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,700
你什么意思  对我做了什么
What do you mean, did something to me?

464
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,200
- 我就在这  好吗  - 好了
- I'm right here, okay? - Okay, well,

465
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,910
他知道你的名字  我不知道
he knew your name, I didn't know that he\\

466
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,040
我就是
it's just...

467
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,130
拉里  这是网上预约
Well, Larry, it's an online reservation.

468
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,560
你知道  我必须把我的名字告诉他才能订酒店
You know, I had to put my name down to book the room.

469
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,870
它自己打印的
It prints out by itself.

470
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,220
我想我应该更敬业一点
I guess I should do a better job

471
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,670
多盯着点那个
of keeping an eye on that, huh?

472
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,700
哼  放松
Humph. Hey, relax.

473
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,700
这真是
\ This is...

474
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,040
嘿  放松
Hey, relax.

475
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,340
看着我
\ Look at me.

476
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,550
- 怎么那么久  - 哦天呐
\ What took you so long? \ Oh, God, there was

477
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,470
遇到了超大一次事故  我在高速上被堵住了
a big accident, I got stuck on the freeway

478
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,060
我试图绕路
and I tried to do a detour.

479
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,850
结果又迷路了  我本来想发短信告诉你
Got really lost, and then I tried to text you

480
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,110
但是发不出去
and it wouldn't send through.

481
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,570
我们就忘记这一切
\ We're gonna forget this whole thing

482
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,070
曾经发生过吧  听到了吗
ever happened, you hear me?

483
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,370
你需要休息
And you're gonna get some sleep.

484
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,580
回回神  然后享受这房间  费用我出
Recharge and enjoy the room on me,

485
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,340
虽然你在我给我一拳
even though you sucker\punched me.

486
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,300
我没有
LARRY: I didn't.

487
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,640
你不用和我握手
CHESTER: You don't have to shake my hand,

488
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,510
我们已经过了那个阶段了
we're way beyond handshakes, buddy.

489
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,900
你也可以免费住一个房间
And you could have a room for free too,

490
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,400
因为你漂亮
just for being so beautiful.

491
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,660
呃  好  我不太明白这是怎么回事
\ Wow, okay, I don't really know what's happening,

492
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,200
不过我喜欢
but I like it.

493
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,040
- 我要回房间了  - 等等
\ I'm gonna go to my room. RACHEL: Uh, wait, um.

494
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,840
刚遇见的时候情况有点糟
It was really upsetting meeting you at first,

495
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,970
但是现在感觉你还挺不错的
but you seem lovely now.

496
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,100
大家都这么说
\ A common refrain.

497
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,730
我在想着是不是真的是他
RACHEL: I wonder if this is actually him.

498
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,610
不  这叫性骚扰
\ No, it's sexual harassment is what it is.

499
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,700
呃
\ Eh...

500
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,620
哈  哈
LARRY:  Ha ha.

501
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,120
我只是不觉得他很有趣
I just don't think that he's funny.

502
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,460
对于你报警找他麻烦这件事
\ Well, he could say the same thing about

503
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,840
他也不觉得搞笑
you calling the cops on him, you know?

504
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,720
不  毕竟  我都道歉了啊
\ No, look, I mean, I kind of apologized.

505
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,730
也许他也没有我想的那么坏
Okay, maybe he's not as bad as I thought.

506
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,850
这次婚礼搞得我
\ Hm. \ This wedding's really just

507
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,860
心神不宁的  你知道不
messing with my head, you know?

508
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,240
我知道  来
\ I know. Here.

509
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,120
会没事的  好吗
It's gonna be all right, okay?

510
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,380
你应该把这个给辛迪
And you should give Cindy this.

511
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,640
- 拿着  - 我们该不该
Take it. \ Should we invite him

512
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,270
请他来婚礼啊
to the wedding? \ Ohh...

513
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,770
- 这三个伙计  - 呃
\ The Three Amigos? \ Ugh!

514
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,400
滚开
Go away!

515
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,520
嘿  辛迪
"Hey, Cindy.

516
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,160
这是我的大鸡鸡朋友切斯特
This is my giant cocked friend Chester.

517
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
你的这个操表亲的婊子
You cousin\fucking bitch."

518
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,010
去  开门啊
Go! Go get it!

519
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,650
是切斯特
\ It's Chester.

520
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,780
打开吧
\ Well, open it.

521
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,660
- 不  把灯关上  - 他会看见的啊  兄弟
\ No, shut off the lights! \ He'll see, dude!

522
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
没准儿他会明白的
\ Maybe he'll get the hint.

523
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,160
马上来
\ We're coming!

524
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,430
抱歉打扰了  我只是来
\ Sorry for interrupting, just dropping off

525
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,760
送饮料的
a couple drinks.

526
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,150
我猜你这么折腾一晚需要喝一杯
Thought you might need them after the night you've had.

527
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,530
我请
On the house.

528
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,420
晚安
Have a good night.

529
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,920
说谢谢  他要走了
\ Say thank you, he's going.

530
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,130
嘿  嘿 切斯特
LARRY: Um, hey, hey, Chester?

531
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,440
谢谢  你真的挺好的
Thanks, man, this is\\ it's really nice.

532
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,570
听着
And... listen,

533
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,190
我很抱歉
I'm sorry again about...

534
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,530
报警吗
\ Calling the cops?

535
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,950
还是往我脸上揍了一拳
Punching me in the face?

536
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,210
别担心
Don't worry about it.

537
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,840
好
\ Okay. Uh...

538
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,600
要不我们一起喝一杯吧
Hey, why don't we join you for a drink?

539
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,230
不了  太晚了
\ Nah, it's late.

540
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,810
来吧  就喝一杯
\ Come on, dude, just one drink.

541
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,950
好吧  就一杯
\ All right, one drink!

542
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,120
就一杯哦  两杯都不行
Just one, though, not two.

543
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,250
那九杯
Maybe nine.

544
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,840
我逗你呢
I'm just fucking with you.

545
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,090
你想喝12杯都行
We could have 12 if you want,

546
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,550
我都行
I'm all set up.

547
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,970
好的
All right.

548
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,600
去那边吗
You want to meet there?

549
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,240
- 所以你只能把他留下  - 是啊
Aw, so you had to leave him. \ Yeah.

550
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,200
赫拉克勒斯只能和妈妈呆在一起了
Hercules had to stay with our mom.

551
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,080
这外面没什么禅意
It wasn't very zen out there.

552
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,590
我在西藏的时候大概是最没有禅意的人了
I was basically the least zen person in Tibet.

553
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,010
我倒不是冥想的那类人
\ I've never been much for meditation.

554
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,260
我曾经有个前任试图偷走我的思想
I had an ex try to steal my mind once,

555
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,770
所以我不得不偷走了她的身体
so I had to steal her body.

556
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,040
我在开玩笑
It was a joke.

557
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,540
得了吧  两位  嗨一点可以吗
Come on, guys, lighten up!

558
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,500
我上周还帮她照顾过狗子
I just watched her dog last week.

559
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,460
她是个大码婊子
She's a big bitch.

560
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,340
那狗也胖
Dog was fat, too.

561
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,100
你有没有认真严肃过
\ So are you ever serious, or...

562
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,900
哦  心理医生出现了哦
\ Oh boy, the doctor's in.

563
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
等我先躺下
Let me just lay on the couch.

564
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,160
我想要撸两发  然后明天早上再来找你
I'll take two hand jobs and call you in the morning.

565
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,290
你的笑话连结构都不对
\ The structure of that joke doesn't even make sense.

566
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,920
而且  要是我是医生的话
Like, if I'm the doctor, I should be the one

567
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
就应该是我来说撸几发的事
prescribing the hand jobs.

568
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,150
这就有意思了
\ Now we're getting somewhere.

569
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,700
这家伙是怎么回事  瑞秋
So what's this guy's deal, Rach?

570
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,460
他是不是一直那么严肃
Has he always been, you know, uptight?

571
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,390
哦  你真该见见小时候的他
RACHEL: Oh, you should have seen him when he was a kid.

572
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,760
他那时还是个快乐的小屁孩
He was the funniest, happiest little guy.

573
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,030
让他憋笑两分钟都不行
Couldn't go two minutes without laughing.

574
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,440
大家都很喜欢他
And everyone adored him.

575
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,270
那现在怎么这样
\ So what happened to him?

576
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,570
那个快乐的小拉里还在
\ Well, that Larry is still there,

577
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,830
不过只有我偶尔才能
it's just that I'm the only one

578
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,950
看见他
that gets to see it sometimes.

579
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,840
说不定他就是个混球呢
\ Or maybe he's just an asshole.

580
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,420
也许吧
Maybe.

581
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,480
哇  他抢到了哎
Whoa! He got it.

582
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,200
好了  你们两个
Okay, you two.

583
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,580
我真希望有人可以和我那么亲近
I wish I had that kind of closeness with somebody.

584
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,630
你有什么故事啊  切斯特
\ So what is your story, Chester?

585
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,090
没有
\ No story.

586
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,560
我就是及时行乐的那类人
I'm just a good\time guy.

587
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,310
几杯酒  几声笑
A few drinks, a few laughs.

588
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,740
我调酒
I'm a maker of cocktails

589
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,620
讲笑话
and a purveyor of jokes.

590
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,630
说实话  我明明过得很好
To be honest, I'm not fucked up at all.

591
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,970
敬新朋友
To new friends.

592
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,480
我们将永远
We'll be holding hands

593
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,240
手牵手
until the end of time

594
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,620
这个可是很特别的一种
This is a very special batch.

595
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,540
不不不不  我不喝了
LARRY: No, no, no, no, no, no, I can't do another one.

596
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,500
不不不
No, no, no, no!

597
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,140
所以这婚礼怎么回事
\ So what's the real story with this wedding, man?

598
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,980
啥意思啊
\ Uh... like, how do you mean?

599
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,790
你这个人愁眉苦脸的
\ You got a real heaviness about you.

600
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,420
你的气场都不稳定
Your aura is all fumbled.

601
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,260
感觉你很想把什么东西释放出来
Feel like you're dying to let something out.

602
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,560
给我讲讲
Level with me.

603
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,810
就是  就是有个妹子
\ It's just... it's just this girl.

604
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,950
她叫啥
\ What's her name?

605
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,210
辛迪・休斯
\ Cindy Hughes.

606
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,190
她是唯一一个我想娶的人
She's the only girl I ever wanted to marry.

607
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,080
但是她甩了我
But she dumped me

608
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,200
就在我准备求婚的前一天
the day before I was gonna propose.

609
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,720
现在  她明天就要结婚了
And now, she's getting married tomorrow.

610
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,430
和谁啊
\ Who's she marrying?

611
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,310
说出来你都不信
\ Pfft, you're never gonna believe this.

612
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,860
我大表兄
My first cousin.

613
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,990
你知道吗  我一直在想
You know, I keep wondering,

614
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,990
是去那个大家都明白
like, what's more humiliating:

615
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:05,210
你这点事儿的地方比较耻辱
to go and know that everyone knows

616
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,590
还是不去那里
or to not go,

617
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,350
心知肚明大家都会暗地里嘲笑我
knowing that everyone there is gonna be

618
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,810
更耻辱一点
secretly laughing at me?

619
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:20,120
你需要做的是笑到最后
\ What you need to do is have the last laugh.

620
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,370
这就是最后一战了
That's the end game, man.

621
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,640
这就是潘康氖だ之道
That's how the loser... wins.

622
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,530
你知道不
LARRY: You know,

623
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,160
我其实真的有考虑做点什么
actually I was thinking about doing something.

624
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,880
辛迪甩了我之后
After Cindy dumped me,

625
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,220
我写一封了结一切的信
I wrote the letter to end all letters.

626
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,640
但是一直没有勇气给她
Just never had the guts to give it to her,

627
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,900
但是明天
but tomorrow,

628
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
明天我就给她
tomorrow I will.

629
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,280
等她说完  我愿意就给
Right before she says, "I do."

630
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,380
我能看看吗
\ Can I see it?

631
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,800
- 快啊  拉里  给我看看
\ Come on, Larry, let me see it.

632
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,310
我们不是很合得来嘛  拉里
We're having a moment here, Larry.

633
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,900
快点啊  拉里  看看呗
Come on, Larry, let me see it.

634
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,570
反正你以后也见不到我了
You're never gonna see me again.

635
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,580
如果我觉得你做得很对
I'll tell you if I think you...

636
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
我会告诉你的
captured the right energy.

637
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,880
我从没让人看过
\ I've never let anyone read it.

638
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,550
连瑞秋也没看过
Not even Rachel.

639
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,790
亲爱的辛迪  我向来不善言辞
\ "Dear Cindy, words are really not my thing.

640
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,960
辛迪  我爱你  我从没如此爱过
Cindy, I love you, I've never loved anyone..."

641
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,230
哦  你太有才了  小拉
Ah, I love you, Lar.

642
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,950
写的很好啊  伙计
That's fucking beautiful, man.

643
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,870
这肯定会让她后悔的
It's gonna crucify her.

644
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,090
现在几点了
\ What time is it?

645
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,600
我不知道  很晚了吧
\ Uh, I don't know, it's late.

646
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,190
行吧  该睡觉了吧
\ Well, uh, bedtime for Bonzo.

647
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,740
嗯  我也该回柜台去了
\ Yeah, I should probably be getting back to the desk.

648
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,950
鬼知道我丢了多少顾客
Who knows how many customers I've missed.

649
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,620
嗯  晚安了
\ All right, good night.

650
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,880
等等
Oh, wait one sec.

651
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,010
我给你拍张照  过来这边
I need to get a picture of you, can you come here?

652
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,630
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

653
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,140
我看起来跟松饼屑一样乱
I look like a scrub muffin.

654
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,020
可拉倒吧  你简直仙女
CHESTER: Shut up, you look amazing.

655
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,480
笑一个  宝贝
Smile, babies.

656
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,490
好吧  好吧
RACHEL: Okay, all right.

657
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,410
晚安
Good night.

658
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,240
拍得很好诶
\ That's a great picture of me.

659
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,290
不过
\ But... just...

660
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,380
晚安啦  大熊猫
CHESTER: Good night, Lar\Bear.

661
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,150
我爱你  拉里
I love you, Larry.

662
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,580
我操  这他妈
What... the fuck?!

663
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,340
去你妈的
What the hell, come on, no!

664
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,060
天哪
Jesus!

665
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:06,700
是谁干的
Who would do this to you?

666
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,980
- 是谁  - 天哪
\ Who is\\ oh, ah. \ Jesus.

667
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,570
- 贝蒂  - 这人是谁啊
\ Oh, no, Betty! \ Who is this guy?

668
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,740
- 他就是那个摩托手  - 贝蒂  不啊
\ He's just this biker guy. \ Betty, no!

669
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,370
- 看样子这次切斯特做得太过分了
\ It looks like Chester went too far this time.

670
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,410
到底  是谁干的
GERRY:  Who would\\ who would do this to you?

671
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,130
为什么对贝蒂下手啊
Not\\ not Betty!

672
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,820
你这个狗娘养的
You goddamn son of a bitch!

673
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,890
- 怎么了  杰拉尔德
\ Is there a problem, Gerald?

674
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,270
- 我他妈发誓
\ I swear to fucking Christ,

675
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,650
我要把他脑袋都撕碎
I'm gonna tear someone's fucking head off.

676
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,660
看来有人在你疟的车上画了个虐
\ Oh, someone put a crotch on your crotch rocket.

677
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,210
是不是你干的
\ Did you do this?

678
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,600
你觉得很有趣吗
You think this is funny?

679
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,020
至少你现在用不着再怀疑别人了
\ Oh, at least you won't mix it up with anyone else.

680
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,270
我的天呐
\  \ Jesus.

681
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
- 一点都不搞笑  - 伙计们
\ Not funny, man. RACHEL: Guys.

682
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,610
操你妈的  住手  老哥
GERRY: Fuck you! RACHEL: Guys, guys, stop it.

683
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:09,280
是什么人能干出这种事
GERRY: Who would do this?

684
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,030
我们先谈谈吧
\ Can we just talk about this?

685
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,410
你也想试试看吗  小个子
\ You want some of this, little man?

686
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:19,800
你会把你碎尸万段
I'm gonna cut you up, man.

687
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,180
他在干嘛
\ What's he doing?

688
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,160
切斯特
\ Chester.

689
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,170
我  就  是
\  I... was... just...

690
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,760
在  耍  你
fucking... with... you!

691
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,180
天呐  天呐
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

692
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,700
杰拉尔德  还好吗
Gerald, are you okay?

693
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,710
杰拉尔德  怎么会这样
Gerald, things got carried away, man.

694
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,550
你还好吗
Are you okay, man?

695
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,310
还好吗
Are you okay?

696
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,600
怎么样啊
You okay?

697
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,560
到底怎么样
You okay, man?

698
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,620
求你了  切斯特  求求你
GERRY: Please, Chester, please.

699
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,000
你得学会接受玩笑
\ You need to learn to take a joke.

700
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,030
切斯特
\ Chester.

701
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,680
还好吗  杰拉尔德
CHESTER:  You okay, Gerald?

702
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,060
还可以吗
Are you okay?

703
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,200
那边的  我觉得他不行了
You guys, I don't think he's all right.

704
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
杰拉尔德 杰拉尔德
Gerald, Gerald!

705
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,230
发生什么了
RACHEL: What happened?

706
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,500
哦  不
CHESTER: Oh, no.

707
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,880
Oh!

708
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,630
我的天呐
Oh, fuck, no.

709
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,640
他有刀
He had a knife.

710
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,890
你看见了  对吧
You saw, right?

711
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,400
他会杀了我的
He was gonna kill me.

712
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,480
杰拉尔德
Gerald!

713
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,790
他死了
He's dead.

714
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
我杀了他
I killed him.

715
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,760
天呐  我杀人了
Holy fuck, I fucking killed someone.

716
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,350
我们得叫警察
\ We have to call the police.

717
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,890
不行
\ No.

718
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,650
一切都会好的
\ Everything's gonna be all right.

719
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:14,990
不  不会的
\ No, it won't.

720
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,040
我会处理好的
I'll take care of it.

721
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,250
你在
What are you\\

722
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,260
你在干嘛
what\\ what are you doing?

723
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,020
我要报警
\ I'll call.

724
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,070
一旦报警  我这辈子就完了
Once I make this phone call, it's gonna change my life.

725
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,830
拉里  能帮我个忙吗
Larry, can I ask you to do something for me?

726
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,420
可  可以
\ O\okay.

727
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,260
能拿点伏特加给我吗
\ Will you go get me some vodka?

728
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,060
伏特加
\ Some vodka?

729
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,060
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

730
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,530
这恐怕是最后一次喝了
\ One last drink before the long walk.

731
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,410
好  我去拿
\ All right, okay.

732
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,810
喂  警局吗
CHESTER: Hello, Sheriff's Department?

733
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,360
粉红汽车旅店发生命案了
There's been a tragedy at the Pink Motel.

734
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,200
我朋友死了
My friend is dead.

735
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,750
是场意外
It was an accident.

736
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,430
我的天  我根本不敢相信
LARRY: Holy shit, I can't believe

737
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,060
刚才发生的一切
what the hell is happening right now.

738
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,180
我们必须报警
\ We have to call the cops.

739
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,980
- 啊  - 现在
\ Huh? \ Now.

740
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,360
他说他已经报了啊
\ He said that he was calling them already.

741
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,820
你以为他真会报警吗
\ You think he really made that call?

742
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,620
我不知道  不知道
\ I don't know. I don't know.

743
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,120
- 手机给我  - 啊
\ Give me your phone. \ Huh?

744
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,580
- 手机  - 在这
\ Give me your phone. \ Right.

745
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,750
天  快点
\ God, come on.

746
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,460
- 快打  快打  - 在打呢  在打
\ Call, call, call, call, call. \ I am, I am.

747
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,640
911  有什么事
OPERATOR: 9\1\1, what's your emergency?

748
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,890
你好
\ Hello, hi, uh, yeah,

749
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,980
我在粉色汽车旅馆休息室
I'm calling from the Pink Motel and Lounge.

750
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,900
- 我要报警  - 哦
\ I wanted to report\\ OPERATOR: Um, yes,

751
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,480
警察已经去了
the sheriff's already on his way.

752
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,780
你们现在有危险吗
Are you currently in danger?

753
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,530
没  现在没有  但是
RACHEL: No, not this second, no, but, um, uh,

754
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,410
请你让他快点好吗
can you just make sure that he\\he's quick?

755
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,750
好的  我会的
OPERATOR: Yes, I'll let him know.

756
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,000
好  谢谢
\ Okay, thank you.

757
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,760
我想你是对的  他的确报警了
I guess you were right, he, uh, he made the call.

758
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,840
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

759
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,350
我  我  在给他拿伏特加啊
\ I'm\\ I'm\\ I'm getting him that\\ that vodka.

760
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,520
什么
RACHEL: What?

761
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,530
天哪  天哪
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

762
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,000
他们应该就是约翰尼和雪莉
\ Looks like it's Johnny and Sherrie.

763
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,810
我知道你们现在可能在想
Now I know you're probably thinking

764
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,810
这对老夫妻居然在他们自己经营的旅店
this elderly couple was horrendously murdered

765
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,280
被残忍杀害了
in the motel that they owned and operate.

766
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,700
不过没错  确实是
And you're right, they were.

767
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,460
但不是我
But not by me.

768
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,050
其实约翰尼就是个世间少有的变态
Turns out Johnny here was a world\class pervert.

769
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,810
我喜欢看着他们做爱
JOHNNY: I like to watch 'em fuck.

770
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,900
他在每个房间都装了隐藏摄像机
\ He had hidden cameras installed in every room.

771
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,690
这些蠢蛋还不知道我在看
JOHNNY: Dumb fucks don't know I'm watching.

772
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,280
他这么多年都在干这个
\ And he was getting away with it for years

773
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,910
直到老好人切斯特来了
until good old Chester came along

774
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:07,080
察觉到这里的腐朽之气
and realized that something was rotten in the state of Denmark.

775
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,590
我查出来了
I figured it out!

776
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,720
我就去找他对峙
So I confronted him about it!

777
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,470
你个混蛋  约翰
SHERRIE: You're a bad man, John!

778
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,560
我去的时候  谢莉感觉这么多年傻逼一样
CHESTER: And when I did, Sherrie felt the years of betrayal

779
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,060
竟然都不知道她丈夫是个变态
of not knowing that her husband was a pervert

780
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,730
然后她拿出一把刀
and she took out a knife.

781
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,110
我要杀了你
SHERRIE: I'm gonna kill you!

782
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,620
就开始捅约翰尼
\ And she started stabbing Johnny.

783
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,450
那我就先杀了你  你个婊子
JOHNNY: Not if I kill you first, bitch!

784
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,330
然后约翰尼就开始掐她
\ And he started strangling her.

785
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,250
结果就是这样  两个人
And there they were, both of them,

786
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:33,590
纠缠在一起  死了
intertwined in this... embrace of death.

787
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,940
互相杀了对方
Killing each other.

788
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,950
这大概是我见过
It was the most honest expression of marriage

789
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:46,240
婚姻最真实的写照了
I've ever seen in my life.

790
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,380
但你们要相信这跟我没一点关系
But you gotta believe I didn't have anything to do with it.

791
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,140
你们相信吗
Do you believe me?

792
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,900
我相信你  切斯特
Yeah, I believe you, Chester.

793
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,790
我来给你倒杯酒吧  好吗
Let's get you that drink, huh?

794
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,880
我就知道我喜欢她是有原因的
I knew there was a reason I liked this girl.

795
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,730
都倒满了
Shots all around.

796
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,280
不能让我一个人喝啊
Well, you're not gonna make me drink this by myself.

797
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,130
我说得没错
I was right.

798
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,050
那个杰拉尔德是怎么说的
What was it that Gerald said?

799
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,060
如果别人给你倒好了酒
It's rude to leave a drink that...

800
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,810
不喝是不礼貌的
someone poured for you.

801
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,530
对了  你妹妹的名字不是你告诉我的
Oh, by the way, you never told me your sister's name.

802
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,200
我是在你的脸书上看到的
I looked on your Facebook page.

803
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,170
快跑
Run!

804
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,050
妈的  我的车钥匙在房间里
Fuck, my keys are in the room.

805
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,550
我的也是
Mine too.

806
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,310
去我房间  去我房间
My room, my room.

807
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,810
这边
Over here.

808
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,190
天呐
Oh my God.

809
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,030
妈的  钥匙呢
Fuck, where the fuck are they?

810
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,650
我怎么知道
How am I supposed to know?

811
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,790
- 妈的  - 不
- Fuck. - No!

812
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,410
混蛋
Oh, shit.

813
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,170
天呐  天呐
Oh my God, oh my God!

814
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,810
不行  不行  不  不
No, no, no, no, no.

815
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,100
你去干嘛啊
What are you doing?

816
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,210
怎么了
What?

817
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,380
他还在外面
He's still there.

818
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,180
天呐
Oh, God.

819
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,100
天呐  天呐  天呐
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

820
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,330
谢天谢地
Oh, God.

821
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,990
我们得警告这个警长
We have to warn the sheriff.

822
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,160
我他妈才不去  这个警长讨厌我
Fuck that, that sheriff hates me.

823
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,760
警长  你得帮我们
Sheriff, you have to help us!

824
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,130
不许动
Don't move.

825
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,720
什么  不是
What? No.

826
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,270
不  不  我们是之前的那两个人  你还记得吗
No, no, no, it's just us from before, remember?

827
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,520
你们俩给我趴到地上
The two of you on the ground now.

828
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,230
你  你不明白
You\\ you don't understand.

829
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,150
他疯了
He is crazy.

830
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,910
好了  我数三下
All right, you've got to the count of three.

831
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,120

One.

832
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
二
Two.

833
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,540
- 好吧  - 三
- Okay. \Three.

834
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,760
谢谢你能过来  警长
Thank you for coming, Sheriff.

835
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,640
天呐  先生  你没事吧
My God, sir, are you all right?

836
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,510
发生什么事了
What happened?

837
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,770
她用一个酒瓶砸了我脑袋
She hit me in the head with a bottle.

838
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,450
你是不是用酒瓶砸了他的脑袋
Did you hit him in the head with a bottle?

839
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:54,950
是的
Yes.

840
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,960
但是  他杀死了餐厅里的那些人
But... he killed those people in the diner,

841
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,800
并且  他还杀了一个人  他的尸体就在

842
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,930
该死的
God damn it.

843
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,180
天呐
Oh, God.

844
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,440
我就知道之前没有
I knew it was a bad idea

845
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,770
逮捕你俩是个错误的做法
not to take you in earlier.

846
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,070
脸朝下
Face down.

847
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:13,320
快点  趴到地上
Right now, on the ground, now!

848
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,450
警官  不是我们干的
Officer, it wasn't us.

849
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,830
因为你帮助和教唆一个白痴
I'm taking you in for aiding

850
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,170
我要把你一起抓住
and abetting an idiot.

851
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,350
喂  喂  别动  别动  别动
Hey, hey, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!

852

求你停下
Please stop!

856
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,590
你笑什么
What are you laughing at?

857
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:43,470
我就是在耍你
I'm just fuckin' with you.

858
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,430
这是无价的
That was priceless.

859
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,560
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

860
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,850
我确实费了很大力气
I mean, it took a lot of work

861
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:48,810
设计了这个圈套
to set this up.

862
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,480
我告诉过你了  他是个变态
I told you, he's a psycho!

863
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,360
闭嘴
Hey, shut up.

864
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,360
一会儿再找你算账  好吗
You're gonna get your chance, all right?

865
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,260
警长  你没事吧
Sheriff, are you okay?

警长  警长  我来帮你一下

You're okay, man.

871

警长  你没事吧
Sheriff, are you okay?

872
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,120
没关系

875
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,380
会没事的  会没事的
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay.

876
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,020
我之前可没用这招杀过人
Well, I never killed anyone like that before.

877
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
拉里  你来看看

爬上车吧  伙计
to the car, man?

889

手术很成功
The surgery was a success.

898
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,200
你他妈离我远点儿

瑞秋  你要去哪儿啊

00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,830
天呐
Oh, my God.

你他妈给他吸了什么东西
What the fuck are you giving him?!

941
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,690
当然是一氧化氮啊
Laughing gas, of course.

942
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,950
不  不  不  不要这样  不要
No, no, no, no, no, don't, no, no, no!

\ Get off me! \ Hush, little baby, don't say a word

953
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:45,230
切斯特会给你买个知更鸟
Chester's gonna buy you a mockingbird

954
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,490
你现在应该知道了吧  瑞秋
You should know by now, Rachel.

955
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:54,120
我就是在耍你
I was just fucking with you.

956
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,090
我死了吗
\ Am I dead?

957
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,390
We get it almost every night

958
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,270
When that moon gets big and bright

959
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:11,950
It's supernatural delight

960
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:16,330
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight

961
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,580
朋友们
CHESTER: My friends,

962
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,550
我们尊贵的客人醒了
our guest of honor is awake.

963
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,270
女士们先生们

拉里  要是你掉下去
Larry, if you fall in,

966
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:33,950
你会淹死的
you're gonna drown.

967
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,660
你胳膊还动不了
You can't move your arms yet.

968
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,410
别急
It's too soon.

969
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,670
先休息吧  哥们
Just relax, my man.

970
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,170
我也救不了你
I won't be able to save you.

971
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,470
我不会游泳
I can't swim!

972
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:44,850
你到底是谁
\ Who are you?

973
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,180
我即是审判
CHESTER: I am Judgment.

974
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,350
即是愤怒
I am Wrath.

975
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,600
而你  拉里亚当斯
And you, Larry Adams,

976
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,360
被决议书了
have been judgmented.

977
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,490
- 这根本不是个词  - 你怎么知道  拉里
\ That's not a word. CHESTER: How do you know, Larry?

978
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,990
你的小皮筏上还有词库吗
Do you have a thesaurus on that raft?

979
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,950
我感觉不太舒服
LARRY: I don't feel well.

980
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,000
天哪  救救我
God help me.

981
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,370
上帝正救着呢  拉里
CHESTER: God is helping you, Larry.

982
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:00,500
他很爱你的
He loves you!

983
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,550
这就是他想你成为的样子
This is the way He wants you to be.

984
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:06,180
欢迎来到我的夏威夷盛宴  拉里
Welcome to my Hawaiian luau, Larry.

985
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,480
你是我尊贵的客人
You are my guest of honor.

986
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,360
这是你的金链子
Here's your golden lei.

987
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:16,120
哦  天哪
Oh, God.

988
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,000
听好  拉里
Listen, Larry.

989
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,370
我不想跟你说谎
I'm not gonna lie to ya,

990
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:22,380
我给喝了大量死藤水
I gave you a mega dose of ayahuasca...

991
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,260
还有点别的
and some other things.

992
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,770
你会感觉稀里糊涂的
You're gonna be feeling a little woozy.

993
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:33,860
还好吗  伙计
You okay, man?

994
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,610
我是谁
\ Who am I?

995
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,870
这就是为什么我们今晚
CHESTER: That's why we're all

996
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,120
聚集在这
gathered here tonight,

997
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,290
就是要查出你到底是谁
to find out who you really are.

998
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,500
你现在很安全  哥们
You're in a very safe space, man.

999
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,210
我是个受过训练的巫师
I'm a trained shaman.

1000
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,720
瑞秋在哪
LARRY: Where's Rachel?

1001
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,760
瑞秋好着呢
\ Oh, Rachel's fine, man.

1002
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,850
她刚换上她的浴袍
She's just changing into her bathing suit.

1003
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,600
我们说不定能去看看
Perhaps we can go check on her.

1004
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,400
仪式先暂停
Let's put the ceremony on pause.

1005
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,900
听好  大熊猫
Listen, Lar\Bear,

1006
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,870
还有件事要你做
there's one more thing I need for you to do.

1007
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:02,790
对你的转变很重要
It's very important for your transition.

1008
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:06,550
好的  是什么
\ Okay, what is it?

1009
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,560
说实话  你今晚
\ You kinda fucked things up for me tonight,

1010
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,140
有点把事情搞砸了
if I'm being honest.

1011
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,900
我本来计划了一个很有趣的夜晚
I had a fun evening planned,

1012
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,570
结果你来了
and then you came along.

1013
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,950
你还真是稀客啊
You're the rarest of things.

1014
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,700
你什么意思
\ What do you mean?

1015
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,840
试着理解这句话
\ Understand this:

1016
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,430
你是个毫无幽默感的人
You're a man completely devoid of a sense of humor.

1017
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:31,060
你是个带刺的守财奴
You're a dour curmudgeon with a scorpion sting.

1018
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:38,780
你就是四月愚人
You're the April Fool.

1019
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,830
我是
\ I am.

1020
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,170
我知道我是
I know I am.

1021
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:47,340
我想你告诉我
\ I want you to tell me,

1022
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,220
带着你全新的光荣的毒瘾告诉我
in all your newfound, drug\addled glory,

1023
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,810
你到底是谁
who you really are.

1024
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,610
告诉我拉里・亚当斯是谁
Tell me who Larry Adams is.

1025
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:58,110
不是什么隐藏的狗屁双重身份
Not the bullshit duality that you hide behind,

1026
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:00,990
也不是你展现给世界的虚假面容
not the mask you present to the world,

1027
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,500
而是最真实的你
but the real you.

1028
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,460
真实的你
The real you.

1029
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,680
好的
\ Okay.

1030
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,090
好孩子
\ Good boy.

1031
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,630
你感觉怎么样
What do you think?

1032
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,510
坐床上吗
On the bed?

1033
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,220
我不知道
\ I don't know.

1034
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,260
那行  坐床上吧
\ Yeah, on the bed.

1035
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,670
不好意思  我拍照技术不好
Sorry, I'm not much of a camera guy.

1036
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,110
好了
Okay.

1037
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,790
嗯  我觉得  我准备好了
\ Okay, I'm ready, I think.

1038
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:48,170
那好  就让真相在你体内翻涌
\ So, let the truth surge through you.

1039
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:56,020
告诉我们  你最真实的  一面
Tell us both who you really... are.

1040
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,650
开始
And action.

1041
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,290
我是个杂碎
\ I'm a troll.

1042
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,630
我
I...

1043
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:11,430
说真的  我是个杂碎
Literally, I'm a troll.

1044
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,020
我是说  我外表上  我
I mean, on the outside, I'm\\

1045
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:23,530
我光鲜亮丽  很温顺
I'm nice, I'm... meek,

1046
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:26,790
和蔼可亲
I'm affable,

1047
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:30,050
但在我内心
but on the inside,

1048
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:33,680
我心里很痛苦
my heart is full of bitterness.

1049
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:40,900
我从没融入过任何圈子
I've never fit in.

1050
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,950
我总是在陌生的世界
I'm on the other side of the glass,

1051
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,280
到处打量
always looking in.

1052
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,210
这太棒了
CHESTER: This is fantastic, man.

1053
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:50,710
发泄出来
Let it out.

1054
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,590
继续
Continue.

1055
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,690
知道吗  在我小时候
\ You know, when I was young,

1056
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,230
我  从来就没能跟其他孩子说说话
I just\\ I never had the ability to talk to other kids.

1057
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,580
我不知道该说什么
I never knew what to say.

1058
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:12,970
就像是我把自己封闭起来了
It's like I'm a prisoner in my own head,

1059
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,850
这让我恨极了人们
and it makes me hate people.

1060
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:21,650
所以
So...

1061
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:27,910
我创造了编程错误
I created ProgrammingFlaw.

1062
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,760
他会做所有我没能做到的
He could do all the things that I never could.

1063
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,550
我感觉很自由
I could be free.

1064
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,560
他能简简单单地摁个按钮就毁了一个人
He can destroy people with a single push of a button.

1065
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,060
听起来很丧心病狂啊
\ Sounds like a hell of a guy!

1066
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,440
是的  的确如此
LARRY: Oh, he is.

1067
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,320
他简直骇人
He's formidable.

1068
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,660
他跟我完全相反
He's everything that I'm not,

1069
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,460
而且他是除了瑞秋唯一一个
and he's the only one who ever had my back,

1070
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,960
支持我的人
Rachel aside.

1071
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,510
谢天谢地  她还支持你
\ Thank God you have her.

1072
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:01,270
其实在我内心深处
LARRY: Deep down in my soul,

1073
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,190
我知道我是谁
I know who I am.

1074
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,700
那么  你是谁
\ So who are you?

1075
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,920
我是编程错误
\  I'm ProgrammingFlaw.

1076
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,230
漂亮
\ Scene.

1077
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,330
握个手吧
Lay it on me, man.

1078
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,230
我们可远不止握手之交
\ We're beyond handshakes.

1079
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:51,870
你完全接受了这个充满力量的你
\  You fully embrace the real powerful you.

1080
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,220
我为你骄傲  Flaw
I'm proud of you, Flaw.

1081
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,390
你做到了
You did it!

1082
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,890
嘿  我现在能见瑞秋了吗
\ Hey, can I see Rachel now?

1083
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,030
有这么个定律
\ Here's the deal.

1084
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,160
对每一个力
For every action,

1085
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,920
都有一个等量的反作用力
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

1086
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,920
牛顿力学第三定律
Newton's third law of motion.

1087
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,760
瑞秋会说因果报应
Rachel would call it karma,

1088
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,050
拉里会说偿还
Larry would call it payback,

1089
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:42,680
我只会说  太他妈有意思了
I'll just call it fucking funny, man.

1090
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:54,580
瑞秋  出来吧
Rachel, come on out!

1091
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,840
她就在那里面
She's just in there.

1092
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:08,940
不要啊  不不不不不不
\ No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1093
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,450
不要啊
No, no, no.

1094
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,450
不
No!

1095
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,080
不不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1096
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,600
不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

1097
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,100
瑞秋
Rachel!

1098
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,810
瑞秋  瑞秋
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

1099
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,200
不要
No!

1100
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:37,620
你说过她很好的
You said she was okay.

1101
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,340
你答应我的
You promised me.

1102
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:46,850
不这样你的转变
\ The transition wouldn't have

1103
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,060
就完不成了  编误
worked otherwise, PFlaw.

1104
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,610
你就不会有所长进
You wouldn't have learned anything.

1105
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:54,120
为什么
\ Why?

1106
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,500
为什么不呢
\ Why not?

1107
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,900
想了解下更有趣的吗
You want to know what's even funnier than this?

1108
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,280
我刚把你可悲的嘴脸和可笑的信
I just posted your pathetic confession

1109
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:20,000
上传到辛迪的婚礼论坛上了
and sappy letter to Cindy on the wedding forum.

1110
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
有几条有趣的评论
Comment highlights:

1111
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,260
听好  你个可怜的婊子
"Pathetic note, bitch.

1112
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:26,010
她绝对不会嫁给你
Of course she'd never marry you.

1113
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,270
做个人吧  怪物
Get a life, freak.

1114
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:30,230
你他妈是怎么回事
What's wrong with you?"

1115
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,900
你真是个可怜虫
"You're just really pathetic."

1116
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,790
哦  这有个好的
Oh, here's a good one.

1117
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,040
这个很简单  死吧
It just says, "Die."

1118
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:45,050
还有一条辛迪自己说的
And here's one from Cindy herself.

1119
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,930
准备好
Ready?

1120
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:48,180
你真是个怪物
"You are a monster..."

1121
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,690
一个怪物
CINDY: ...a monster.

1122
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,060
我从来没有爱过你
I never even liked you.

1123
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,570
你真可怜
CHESTER: "You're pathetic."

1124
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,280
天
Wow!

1125
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,820
她还真是恨你啊  大熊猫
She really hates you, Lar\Bear.

1126
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,900
怎么了
What?

1127
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,590
你知道吗
\ Do you know what?

1128
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,930
我看错你了
I was wrong about you.

1129
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,490
天  你还真是滑稽啊
Oh my God, you are funny.

1130
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,950
我  我是说
I mean, I...

1131
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:43,120
我意思是  我懂了  我现在全明白了
I mean, I\\ I see it, man, I get it all now.

1132
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,460
这一切太有才了
All of this was genius.

1133
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,220
我说  你简直是莫扎特再世啊
I mean, you're like Mozart, man.

1134
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,810
就是喜剧界的莫扎特
You're like the Mozart of comedy.

1135
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,120
一整晚  我都在等你说这话呢
\ I've been waiting all night for you to say that.

1136
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,620
你真是太有趣了
\ You're hilarious.

1137
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,870
我是说  你是个有趣的天才啊
I mean, you're a funny fucker.

1138
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:10,510
我说  那些人  杰拉尔德和那个警察
I mean, those guys, Gerald and the Sheriff,

1139
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,970
他们什么了
what is wrong with them?

1140
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:14,480
他们本也该在这笑的啊
They should've been laughing too, man.

1141
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,150
我天  还有那对老夫妻
Oh my God, that dead couple?

1142
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,900
他们根本就是活该啊
I mean, they just flat\out deserved it.

1143
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:26,170
等等  你现在在录吗
Oh, wait, are you filming this right now?

1144
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,590
我们连续杀人狂可是
CHESTER: Oh, we serial killers

1145
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,140
很喜欢留着做纪念的啊
like to keep souvenirs.

1146
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:35,730
编误  你简直是屠宰场的
PFlaw, you're a breath of fresh air

1147
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,520
一股清流啊
in a slaughterhouse.

1148
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:47,380
但凡事都有个尽头啊
But all good things must come to an end.

1149
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,800
还有什么最后的遗愿吗
Any last requests?

1150
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,940
我不想死在这
I don't want to die here.

1151
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:01,160
我是说  我已经不想活了
I mean, I don't want to live anymore.

1152
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,080
但我不想死在这
I don't want to die here.

1153
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:10,800
我们去婚礼吧
Let's go to the wedding.

1154
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
啊
Huh?

1155
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,180
我们三个人
All three of us.

1156
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,440
我记得  那边有个山
I mean, there's\\ there's a hill

1157
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,070
能俯瞰婚宴
overlooking the festivities.

1158
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:25,330
想想看吧  当我们突然出现
I mean, imagine the look on their dumbass faces

1159
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:27,040
他们蠢逼的表情
when we rock up.

1160
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,710
我意思是  我还有瑞秋这个死人
I mean, just me and Rachel, dead,

1161
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:31,840
从山上朝他们滚下去
just tumbling down a hill towards them.

1162
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:35,850
这样的话
Now that...

1163
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,360
那绝对会很有意思的
That would be fucking hilarious.

1164
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,830
你在耍我吗
\ Are you just fucking with me?

1165
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,550
你说呢
\ You tell me.

1166
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,490
你往哪走呢
\ Where you going?

1167
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,580
我们开瑞秋的车
\ Let's take Rachel's car.

1168
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,340
我来开
I'll drive.

1169
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:16,510
- 你想开吗  - 得了吧  切斯特
CHESTER: You want to drive? \ Oh, come on, Chester.

1170
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,400
瑞秋才不会让你开她车呢
Rachel would never let you drive her car.

1171
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,520
瑞秋  瑞秋
Rachel! Rachel!

1172
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,410
你会让切斯特开吗
Would you let Chester drive your car?

1173
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:26,410
瑞秋说  没门
Rachel says, "No fucking way."

1174
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:29,250
好了  切斯特
Come on, Chester.

1175
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,290
你的气场都有点乱了
Your aura seems a little jumbled.

1176
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:38,100
听着  哥们  我只想说
Look, man, I just wanted to say,

1177
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,600
这一切  谢谢你
thank you for everything.

1178
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,780
钥匙
Keys.

1179
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:45,610
走咯
Let's roll.

1180
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:48,290
我要干翻一切活物
CHESTER: I'll fuck anything that moves!

1181
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:51,290
或不活的
Or doesn't move.

1182
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:52,670
抱歉  瑞秋
Sorry, Rachel.

1183
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:56,930
Get your face wrapped up

1184
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:58,430
Smacked up, we hold it down

1185
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:01,440
Drag you in the gym and I plan to cut that ass down

1186
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,940
Metal shards, my blade slicing your windpipe

1187
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:08,280
Strobe lights flashing, fury's blinding my eyesight

1188
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,950
瑞秋  你非得在车上尿吗
CHESTER: Rachel, do you have to pee?

1189
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,330
切斯特  我给你讲个笑话吧
\ Chester, can I tell you a joke?

1190
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,460
讲吧  哥们
\ Absolutely, man.

1191
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,590
以前有两个傻子
\ So there's these two idiots,

1192
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:37,180
他们沿着路开车
and they're driving down the road.

1193
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,930
然后
CHESTER: And?

1194
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:42,480
他们的名字是拉里和切斯特
\ Okay, and they're called Larry and Chester.

1195
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,360
后座上坐着拉里的妹妹
And Larry's sister is sittin' in the back,

1196
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,200
可惜一句话也不说
woop, not sayin' a word.

1197
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,450
我已经笑了
\ I like it already.

1198
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,870
瑞秋  不说话感觉很棒吧  是吧
Rachel, be quiet for the punchline, okay?

1199
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,970
然后拉里跟切斯特说
\ And then Larry says to Chester,

1200
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:03,980
如果你现在能成为世界上的任何人
"If you could be anything in the world right now,

1201
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,360
你想成为谁
what would you be?"

1202
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,860
然后切斯特回答到
And\\ and Chester replies,

1203
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:10,240
我不知道啊  我会成为什么人呢
"Well, I don't know, what would I be?

1204
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,200
不知道  成为谁呢
\ I don't know, what would I be?

1205
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,380
好吧  拉里说
\ "Well," says Larry,

1206
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:20,010
你会成为瑞秋的狗
"you'd be Rachel's dog."

1207
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,270
瑞秋的狗
\ Rachel's dog?

1208
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,900
是的  没错
LARRY: Yeah, that's right.

1209
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,660
切斯特会成为瑞秋的狗赫拉克勒斯
Chester would be Rachel's dog, Hercules.

1210
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,260
现在切斯特说
Now Chester says,

1211
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:44,390
为什么我会成为赫拉克勒斯
"W\why would I be Hercules?"

1212
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:46,900
为什么我会成为赫拉克勒斯
\ W\why would I be Hercules?

1213
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,480
因为  拉里说
\ "Well," says Larry,

1214
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,910
瑞秋非常喜欢赫拉克勒斯
"Rachel just loved Hercules so much

1215
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:53,410
连坐车都跟她一起
that she had him ride up front with her

1216
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:55,290
坐在副驾驶位置上
in the passenger seat."

1217
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:58,380
其实也就是你现在的位置
In fact, just right there in your seat right there.

1218
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,300
天呐  你真实太贴心了  瑞秋
CHESTER:  Oh, you're so thoughtful, Rachel.

1219
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,390
我想说  其实这都不太合法
LARRY: I mean, it wasn't exactly legal,

1220
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:05,180
但她真的很爱那只狗
but she just loved that dog so much.

1221
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:07,440
是吗  - 是的  没错
CHESTER: Yeah? \ Yeah, yeah.

1222
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,410
几乎跟爱我一样
Almost as much as she loved me.

1223
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:14,080
她总是想保护他
She always wanted to keep him safe.

1224
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:19,460
然后就给车做了点改装
So, she made an alteration to the car!

1225
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,030
我怎么没听懂啊  拉里
\ What's the punchline, Larry?

1226
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:32,820
听不懂了吧
\ What's the punchline?

1227
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,200
切斯特
Oh, Chester.

1228
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:38,540
这笑点就在于  因为赫拉克勒斯
The punchline is that because of Hercules

1229
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:43,800
瑞秋把车一边的气囊卸了
Rachel disabled the airbags on one side of the car,

1230
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,720
就是切斯特那边的
Chester's side of the car.

1231
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,690
现在我要冲向一堵墙
Now I'm gonna drive us into a fucking wall.

1232
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,320
你才不会呢  拉里
\ You wouldn't, Larry.

1233
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,370
你说得对
LARRY: You're right.

1234
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,750
拉里才没这胆量
Larry wouldn't have the balls.

1235
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,500
但我现在是编程错误
But I'm ProgrammingFlaw.

1236
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,190
敬这爽朗的
To the beautiful sound

1237
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:12,570
笑声
of laughter.

1238
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:35,740
Yo, blood spray and the blood splatter

1239
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,990
She loves the way I'm looking

1240
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:38,620
when I come and the paint splatters

1241
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:41,000
She's an open book that I can read but I'd rather fuck

1242
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,510
I don't want to talk no more, I just want to nut

1243
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:46,010
This is where we both hold hands to the bitter end

1244
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:47,640
But fuck that, let's walk through hell

1245
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,020
to see how this ends

1246
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,100
Now I'm staring at myself in the broken glass

1247
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,650
Thinking how I let you slip away,

1248
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,030
I'm still wanting that ass

1249
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,110
If I get one more time, I'll let you know

1250
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,540
How I want to kill everything that you try to grow

1251
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:01,170
How I want to fuck every part of your wretched soul

1252
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,670
How I want to break you inside and make it slow

1253
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:06,180
I ain't got a gun in my hand, just fucking raw

1254
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,890
She ain't got a bullet in the chamber

1255
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:09,180
but she got all sheen

1256
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,190
Gotta beg me to come disassemble her

1257
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:13,820
When she wants a man, I'm the one that convinces her

1258
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,320
So take it in your mouth, baby doll, this is elegance

1259
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,830
Watch it as the world burns in this irrelevance

1260
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:19,910
If we could die together,

1261
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:21,330
free the blood of the excellence

1262
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:24,210
Girl, 'cause I'm hellbound, that or I'm heaven\sent

1263
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:31,890
'Cause I'm hellbound, that or I'm heaven\sent

1264
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:35,070
