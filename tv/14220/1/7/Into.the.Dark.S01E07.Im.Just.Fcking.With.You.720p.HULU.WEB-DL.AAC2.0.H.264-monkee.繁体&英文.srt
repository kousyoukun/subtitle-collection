人真棒啊
Huh. Nice guy, huh?

124
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,630
他可溫和了
Aw, he's a teddy bear.

125
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,690
很有幽默感
Great sense of humor.

126
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,520

Oh, really?

127
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,940
你來做什么的
So what are you in for?

128
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,270
就是家族婚禮
Oh, just this family wedding thing, it's...

129
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,740
那個最討厭了
Oh. Those are the worst.

130
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,710
或許你能走桃花運
Maybe you'll get your bone buried.

131
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,400
是啊
Oh, yeah.

132
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,580
你是怎么了
What's going on with you, man?

133
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,940
坐下吧
Sit down, come on.

134
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,140
跟切斯特說說  坐下
Vent to Chester, sit down.

135
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,220
沒事  就是...
Uh, um...no, it's, it's...

136
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,410
不好說  應該沒事的
I don't know, it should be fine, actually.

137
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,930
答錯了
Wah, wah! Wrong answer.

138
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,400
就是
No, I mean, it's just...

139
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,290
有好多我好久沒見過的人
there's a lot of people I haven't seen in a while,

140
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,260
那是...
so that's...

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
不止如此
There's more to it than that.

142
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,140
好吧
Okay, okay, um...

143
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,230
我不知道  我討厭跳舞
I don't know, I hate dancing,

144
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,010
這是首先
first of all.

145
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,060
食物從來都不怎么樣
The food's always a letdown.

146
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,530
食物  不是吧  說吧
The food, really? Come on.

147
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,880
好吧  我不得不出了75塊
All right. I had to shell out 75 bucks

148
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,960
買烤板  因為那是禮物登記單上

149
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,670
最后一樣東西
the last thing on the registry.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,800
烤板
Aw, cookie sheets!

151
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,440
難道豬小姐還會自己烤餅干嗎
Like Miss Piggy's ever gonna bake her own cookies, right?

152
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,790
是啊...但我告訴你
That's, I mean... I'll tell you what, though.

153
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,530
我希望她喜歡那些烤板
I hope that she likes those cookie sheets,

154
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,940
因為說真的  它們可比
because, honestly, they're gonna last

155
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,090
她的婚姻能持久得多
a lot longer than her marriage.

156
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,820
那聽上去是個你不會娶的姑娘
That sounds like a girl that you wouldn't marry.

157
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,630
不  婚姻不適合我
Nah, marriage is just not my thing.

158
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,140
敬永遠的孤狼
To lone wolves forever.

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,580
嗯
Yeah!

160
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,320
嗯
Yeah.

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,120
我真的想睡了
So I really am just really tuckered out,

162
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,360
-能把鑰匙給我嗎  -當然
- so could I get the key? - No sweat.

163
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,170
我只需要你的信用卡
All I need is your credit card

164
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,650
我就能給你登記
and we'll sign you right in.

165
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,790
我已經給了你75美元的房間錢了
I already gave you the 75 bucks for the room.

166
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,110
我知道了
Oh, I get it.

167
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,100
以牙還牙是吧
Tit-for-tat, right?

168
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,480
不  我真需要你的信用卡
No, I'm just gonna need that credit card.

169
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,510
你說真的嗎
Are you serious?

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,790
當然了  伙計  這里又不是小客棧
Afraid so, man, I mean, I ain't operating a halfway house here.

171
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,490
不  我不是那意思
No, I'm not saying that,

172
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,530
但我剛進來時
it's just that when I first came in,

173
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,660
你記得嗎  就剛剛
you remember, like, a minute ago,

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,170
你還說  如果我給現金
you said if I give you cash,

175
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,000
你就不收稅了
then you wouldn't charge tax?

176
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,830
然后  我拿了現金
And then, I took out the cash

177
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,120
把錢遞給了你
and I handed you the cash.

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,020
那個機車黨
I mean, that guy, that biker guy, he--

179
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,230
首先  他叫杰拉德
First of all, his name is Gerald,

180
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,230
其次  正是因此  我從不
and second, I never check in anyone

181
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,060
不辦妥手續就讓人入住
without proper paperwork for this reason.

182
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,350
我明白  但這太瘋狂了
I understand that, but this is crazy.

183
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,810
你打的什么主意啊
I mean, what are you trying to pull here?

184
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,600
聽著
Look, man.

185
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,830
你走了進來  我們喝了點酒
You came in here, we had some drinks,

186
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,500
我們笑了笑
we had some laughs,

187
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,180
如果你要房間  可以
and if you want a room, that's great.

188
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,860
但我需要帶照片的身份證和信用卡
I'll just need a photo ID and a credit card.

189
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,750
好吧  那倒空你的口袋
All right, well, empty your pockets, then.

190
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,830
什么
Excuse me?

191
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,430
你倒空你的口袋
You empty your pockets

192
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,410
你會看到里面有我的錢
and you'll see my money in there.

193
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,440
你把我的錢...這太荒唐了
You put the money-- this is ridiculous.

194
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,590
你要我報警嗎
I mean, do I have to call the cops?

195
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,050
隨你  報警吧
Go ahead, call the cops.

196
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,180
順便  我還有個點子
And while you're at it, I got another idea.

197
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,110
把你的手伸出來
Put out your goddamned hand,

198
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,070
因為你的房間鑰匙在這里
because I got your room key right here.

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,710
伙計  你真該看看你的樣子
Oh, man, you should have seen yourself.

200
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,400
我在逗你玩呢
I'm just fucking with you, man.

201
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,150
-好吧  -你真該
- Oh, okay. - You should have

202
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,310
看到自己  "這太荒唐了  我要報警嗎"
seen yourself, "This is ridiculous! Do I have to call the cops?"

203
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,250
-不是的  -抱歉了
- No, you know... - Sorry, man.

204
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,750
要我叫更夫嗎
You want me to call the bellman?

205
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,440
不用
No.

206
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,660
很好  因為我們沒有
Good, because we don't have one.

207
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,470
好吧
Okay.

沒錯  查克  南柑橘這里
That's right, Chuck, it is still chaos out here

229
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,570
仍因多車連撞
on South Citrus at that multi-car pileup

230
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,390
而雙向擁堵
that has caused gridlock in both directions.

231
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,160
詳情還在不斷傳來
Details are still trickling in,

232
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,460
但距目擊者稱  一輛皮卡車
but witnesses report seeing the pickup truck

233
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,520
在路上蛇形駕駛  然后轉向
swerving erratically before veering into

234
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,460
撞上了迎頭而來的車  導致了連鎖反應
oncoming traffic, causing this chain reaction

235
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,670
造成了一名年輕女子死亡
which left one young woman dead

236
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,110
數人情況危急
and several people in critical condition,

237
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,030
包括一名嬰兒
including an infant.

238
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,570
據目擊者稱  司機
The driver, who witnesses say

239
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,520
明顯喝醉了
was visibly intoxicated,

240
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,080
隨后逃離了現場
then fled the scene.

241
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,250
治安官找到了嫌疑人的車輛
Sheriffs found the suspect's vehicle,

242
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,130
一款新皮卡車
a late-model white pickup,

243
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,650
被棄在距車禍現場幾街區的地方
a few blocks away from the scene of the accident,

244
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,620
嫌疑人似乎...
where it appears as if the sus--

245
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,440
接聽啊
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

246
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,460
這里是瑞秋
Hi, you've reached Rachel.

247
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,970
我現在不能接聽
I'm away from the phone right now,

248
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,200
但我會給你回電  請留言
but I'll call you back if you leave a message.

249
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,150
你去哪了
Where the fuck are you?

250
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,910
你好  粉紅汽車旅館酒廊
Hello, Pink Motel and Lounge.

251
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,200
切斯特嗎
Hi, uh, Chester?

252
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,460
舉世無雙
The one and only.

253
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,080
我是6號房的拉瑞
Oh, um, hey, this is Larry in Room 6.

254
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,710
嗯  拉瑞  我知道你是誰
Yeah, Larry, I know who you are.

255
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,930
我想問問我到之后  是否有人
Yeah, I was just wondering if anyone checked in

256
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,930
來過
since I got here.

257
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,480
我妹妹本該來見我的
My sister is supposed to come meet me,

258
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,390
我不知道  她遲到了好久
and, I don't know, she's pretty late.

259
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,890
我不知道她有沒有來過
I don't know if she came in

260
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,670
或打過電話什么的
or called, or anything.

261
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,270
好吧
Oh, well, uh...

262
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,960
沒人來過  但我查查留言
no one's come in but let me check the messages.

263
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,430
-或許我漏接了電話  -好啊  謝謝
- Maybe I missed a call. - Great, thanks.

264
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,870
拉瑞  我有壞消息
Hey, Larry, I got some bad news.

265
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,060
怎么
Yeah?

266
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,900
是你妹妹的事
It's about your sister.

267
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,070
是有通留言
There was a message.

268
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,900
我真不想告訴你這種事
I hate to be the one to tell you this, man.

269
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,590
她不來了  拉瑞
She's not coming, Larry.

270
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,810
她找到了根大屌吹
She found a big cock to suck on,

271
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,640
然后她死了  上了天堂
then she died and went to heaven.

272
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,790
搞什么啊
What the fuck?

273
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,310
拜托  這根本沒道理
Come on, man, it doesn't even make sense

274
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,630
如果她出事了
that someone would call me

275
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,010
怎么會有人打給我
if something happened to her.

276
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,760
天吶  切斯特
Jesus, Chester.

277
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,680
如果你需要什么給我打電話
Just call if you need anything.

278
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,690
難以置信
Unbelievable.

Thank you.

282
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,710
你碰我了嗎  小子

283

我  我沒有
No, no, I didn't, sir.

284

你碰了  是吧
Yeah, you did, didn't you,

285
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,840
小子
little man?

286
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,470
知道這寫的是什么嗎
You know what this says?

287
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,650
不知道
No, sir.

288
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,020
孤狼
Lone wolf!

289
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,480
知道它代表了什么嗎
Do you know what it represents?

290
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,080
-不知道  -代表了我的盔甲
- No. - It represents my armor.

291
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,880
你不能碰公路戰士的盔甲
And you don't touch a road warrior's armor

292
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,250
除非你準備好了要戰斗
unless you're ready to fight

293
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,370
或大干一場
or fuck.

294
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,150
你準備戰斗了嗎
You ready to fight?

295
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,100
沒有
Uh, no.

296
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,940
不要
Oh, no.

297
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,610
那好吧
Oh. Well, cool.

298
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,930
你剛勉強躲過了被爆菊
You just narrowly avoided an ass pounding, dude.

299
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,760
7號房  如果你想走運的話
Room 7 if you feel lucky.

300
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,840
{\an8}你能至少接我電話嗎  我好擔心
你在哪

301
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,450
{\an8}提醒
約翰·P回復了你的評論
是啊  那地方就是疾病和犯罪的溫床  關門吧

302
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,130
{\an8}提醒
約翰·P回復了你的評論
是啊  那地方就是疾病和犯罪的溫床  關門吧

303
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,450
我真需要你的信用卡
I'm just gonna need that credit card.

304
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,380
{\an8}犯罪

305
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,620
"我要報警嗎"
"Do I have to call the cops?"

306
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,980
大屌吹
Big cock to suck on.

307
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,940
{\an8}疾病

308
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,810
孤狼
Lone wolf!

309
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,210
{\an8}關門吧

310
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,350
{\an8}說真的  你在哪  給我發短信  我沒法再一個人待在這里了

311
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,040
{\an8}6號房  拉瑞

312
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,370
{\an8}6號房  拉瑞

313
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,330
{\an8}愛你的  妹妹

314
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,500
真好笑  切斯特
Very funny, Chester.

315
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,180
{\an8}辛迪·休斯
要嫁給完美男人  身邊都是棒棒的人  好幸福
#辛迪和馬克的婚禮

316
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,720
{\an8}艾米·漢森
回復@辛迪休斯001
7小時倒計  肯定很棒的#辛迪和馬克的婚禮

317
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:26,260
{\an8}編譯缺陷3489
你以為@辛迪休斯001 最差勁的是出軌嗎  不  7小時后還會刷新下限

318
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,900
{\an8}發送

319

{\an8}編譯缺陷3489
你以為@辛迪休斯001 最差勁的是出軌嗎
不  7小時后還會刷新下限
準備迎接大結局吧
#辛迪和馬克的婚禮

320
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,540
瑞秋
Rachel...

321
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,380
嗯  我就過去
Hey, yeah, I'll be right there.

322
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,900
誰啊
Hello?

323
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,270
不  我沒事  請稍后再來吧
No, I'm okay, just come back later, please.

324
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,260
不  我在洗澡  你可以待會兒再來嗎
No, I'm in the shower, can you come back?

325
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,900
拉瑞  你沒事吧
Larry, you okay in there?

326
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,490
切斯特
Chester?

327
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,100
當然是我
Yeah, man, of course it's me.

328
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,900
不是所有清潔工都說西語的
Not all cleaning people speak Spanish.

329
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,710
那是很種族歧視的假定
That's kind of a racist assumption.

330
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,620
聽著  我是想在你
Listen, man, I was hoping to get to you

331
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,140
用廁所前找到你
before you used the bathroom.

332
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,270
門有點問題  有些客人
It's got a tricky door that's been giving guests

333
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,970
遇到過麻煩  我之前想說來著
some problems, I meant to tell you this before

334
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,440
但我們之前聊得太開心了
but we were having such a good time.

335
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,390
別逗我了
Just stop joking around, man.

336
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,220
什么  不  我是喜歡開玩笑
What? No, come on, man, I like to joke around

337
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,950
但我不會這樣搞你的
but I wouldn't mess with you like this.

338
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,170
隨你說我妹妹
Just say that my sister is, like,

339
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,860
在給大屌吹簫什么的  但放我出去
sucking a big dick or whatever and just let me out, man.

340
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,150
拉瑞  我發誓  我會因為
Larry, I swear I could lose my job

341
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,730
這種事丟了工作的
over something like this, man.

342
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,860
雪莉和約翰尼說得很清楚
Sherrie and Johnny made it very clear

343
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,440
我得告訴住在六房的客人這扇門壞了
that I had to tell guests in Room 6 about this door.

344
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,950
你得幫幫我  兄弟
You got to help me out, man.

345
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,800
讓我出去  我什么也不會說  好嗎
Just let me out and then I won't say anything, okay?

346
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,870
行  老天  你真是個好人
All right. Geez, you're a good man.

347
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,070
我覺得我需要你
Okay, I think‐‐ I'm gonna need you

348
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,710
用力推這扇門
to put a lot of pressure on the door.

349
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,470
什么
What?

350
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,850
這是最老套的耍人技巧了  哥們
That is the oldest trick in the book, man,

351
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,760
我不會上當
I'm not gonna fall‐‐

352
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,680
我明白你為什么會這么想
Okay, I understand why you think that,

353
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,570
但我沒有逗你  拉瑞
but I'm not fucking with you, Larry.

354
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,870
你在推嗎
Are you putting pressure?

355
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,300
嗯  我在推
Yes, I'm doing it.

356
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,860
好的  現在你需要使勁  好嗎
Okay, good, now you're gonna need a lot of leverage, okay, man?

357
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,060
你必須得用力
You've got to really do it,

358
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,460
用身體全部重量壓上去
put all your weight against it.

359
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,860
-我在推了  -好  跟我一起用力
‐ I'm doing it! - All right, just do it at the same time,

360
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,610
準備好了嗎  數到三  一
you ready, on three. One‐‐

361
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,880
哥們  我們做到了
Oh, man, we did it, buddy.

362
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,160
你他媽有什么毛病啊
What the hell is wrong with you?

363
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,400
好吧  你沒有笑
Okay, okay, I see you're not laughing.

364
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,910
但從我的角度看這件事
But look at it from my perspective.

365
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,840
沒錯  我是把門給堵上了
I mean, yes, I was holding the door shut.

366
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,040
怪我
Bad on me.

367
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,930
但說實話  我沒想到你真會上當
But honestly, I never thought you'd fall for it.

368
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,500
既然我們都已經說到一半了
And once we were in the middle of it,

369
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,900
我怎么能中途停止呢
how could I stop?

370
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,370
拜托  只是個玩笑
Come on, man, it was just a joke.

371
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
是我  切斯特啊
It's me, Chester.

372
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,270
你真可悲
You are pathetic.

373
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,050
你知道嗎
Do you know that?

374
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,610
沒人喜歡你這種人  你就是
Nobody likes people like you, you just‐‐

375
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,910
你就是沒有眼力見
you never get the hint.

376
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,340
你只是不停地得寸進尺
You just push and you push

377
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,610
蹬鼻子上臉
and you push and you push.

378
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,150
我告訴你吧
Well, let me tell you something.

379
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,030
沒人覺得你搞笑
Nobody thinks that you're funny!

380
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,950
就...
Just...

381
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,820
你覺得我不搞笑  是嗎
You don't think I'm funny, huh?

382
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,480
那你覺得什么搞笑
Well, what do you think is funny, then?

383
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,000
來啊  給我講個笑話
Come on, tell me a joke.

384
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,640
切斯特  我們都累了
Chester, we're both tired,

385
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,190
今天發生了很多事  所以能不能
it's been a long day, so can‐‐

386
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,360
給我講個笑話
Tell me a joke.

387
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,610
來啊
Come on.

388
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,670
你管沒有身體和鼻子的人叫什么
What do you call a man with no body and no nose?

389
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,500
什么
What?

390
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,340
沒人知道[音同]
Nobody knows.

391
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,630
真不錯  拉瑞
That's a great one, Larry.

392
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,880
我就知道你會講笑話  拉瑞
I knew you had it in you, Larry.

393
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,080
太好笑了  哥們
That was great, man.

394
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,590
-好吧  -行
‐ Okay. ‐ All right.

395
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,150
祝你晚安  哥們
Have a good night, man.

396
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,490
喂  瑞秋
Hey, Rachel, uh,

397
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,910
我不知道你在哪
I don't know where you are,

398
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,840
但我得離開這旅館了
but I've got to leave this motel,

399
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
這里太奇怪了
it's just weird here,

400
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,400
而且我也不知道你為什么沒收到我的信息
and I don't know why you're not getting my messages,

401
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,530
但如果你能給我回電
but if you just want to call me back,

402
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,690
也許我就把車停在路口
maybe I'll just wait in my car

403
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,380
在車里等你  看你會不會經過或者...
down the road and see if you come by or...

404
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,820
簡直太蠢了
It's just so stupid.

405
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,360
拜托了  我希望你能收到這些信息
Just please, please, I hope you get these messages, and...

406
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,170
我有點擔心你出車禍了
I'm kind of concerned you were in a car crash.

407
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,100
我希望沒有
I hope not.

408
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,000
該死
Aww, shit.

409
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,760
之前我讓事態發展得有些難堪
I really let things get out of control earlier.

410
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,130
我不知道自己怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

411
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,040
你也許是個好家伙  但你知道
You're probably a good sport, but you know,

412
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,240
如果你給了老鼠一塊餅干它還會開口要牛奶
you give a moose a cookie and he asks for milk.

413
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,260
我得寸進尺了
I was asking for milk.

414
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,150
對不起
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,500
嗯
Yeah.

416
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,920
我無法阻止你離開  但是
Well, I can't stop you from leaving, but

417
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,950
如果你非走不可
if you have to,

418
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,150
請接受我的道歉  作為朋友分別
please accept my apology and part as my friend.

419
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,590
行吧
Okay, then.

420
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,230
如果瑞秋來了
If Rachel shows up,

421
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,220
我會告訴她你不得不離開
I'll tell her you had to leave.

422
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,900
好好享受婚禮
Enjoy the wedding.

423
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:51,710
{\an8}拜托給我回電  這不是鬧著玩的

424
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,340
{\an8}瑞秋
我一個人在這待不下去了

425
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,900
他怎么知道她的名字
How did he know her name?

426
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,950
他怎么知道她的名字
How did he know her name?

00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,720
我在粉紅汽車旅館酒廊
I'm at the Pink Motel and Lounge,

432
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,310
或員工  他在照看...
or a guy who's‐‐ who's looking after‐‐

433
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,010
{\an8}粉紅汽車旅館

434
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,980
你們得派人過來
I need you to send someone out...

435
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,610
*小蜜蜂*
*honey bee*

436
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,830
*我猜沒有其他可以說的*
*Guess there's nothing else to know*

437
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,910
*除了我愛你*
*Except I love you so*

438
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,780
{\an8}辦公室

439
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,220
所以我在我的車里
You know, so I'm in my car.

440
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,710
我必須得退房  因為他整晚都在耍我
I had to check out because, I mean, he's been messing with me all night.

441
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,590
但他說了"瑞秋"  就是我妹妹的名字
But he had said "Rachel," which is my sister,

442
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,680
可他不可能知道她的...
and there's no way that he knows what‐‐

443
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,590
就是他
that's him.

444
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,140
就是  就是他
That's‐‐ that's him.

445
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,310
先生  我能和你談談嗎
Sir, can I talk to you for a minute?

446
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,310
找到我的兒童毛片了嗎  治安官
Found out about my kiddie porn, huh, sheriff?

447
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,600
我開個玩笑
Aw, just kidding.

448
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
都還算是合法的吧
They're all legal, barely.

449
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,320
別跟我開這種玩笑  先生
Don't even joke about that, sir.

450
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,190
你怎么知道她的名字的  切斯特
How'd you know her name, Chester?

451
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,900
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

452
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,030
瑞秋
Rachel.

453
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,370
我從沒告訴過你她的名字
I never told you her name,

454
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,700
如果她沒來過  你怎么知道她的名字
so if she hasn't been here, then how do you know it?

455
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,330
因為你告訴我了  你個傻帽
Because you told me her name, you dope.

456
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,420
你真的就因為你忘記告訴過我
I mean, did you seriously call the cops because

457
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,580
你妹妹的名字就把警察叫來了
you forgot you told me your sister's name?

458
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,050
我...
I...

459
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,390
行了  交給我吧  先生
All right. I'll handle this, sir.

460
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,670
約翰尼和雪莉在哪
Where's Johnny and Sherrie?

461
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,020
我替他們看店呢
I'm just covering for them.

462
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,260
來我辦公室談吧
Step into my office.

463
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,570
好了
All right.

464
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,310
我們先冷靜一下
Let's just calm down here.

465
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,850
你站在那
I want you over there.

466
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,230
你  去另一個房間
You, other room.

467
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,610
我們要談談  先生
You and me gonna talk, sir.

468
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,430
我能幫什么忙
So what can I do?

469
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,430
我只是幫著看店
I mean, I'm just keeping the place open,

470
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,850
這些破事不能讓我負責啊
I can't be in charge of the crazies.

471
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,560
聽著  今晚是滿月
Right, well, listen, it's a full moon out here

472
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,680
你不是今晚唯一一個要面對瘋子的人
so you're not the only one with crazy people tonight.

473
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,570

475
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,670
先生  先生
Sir‐‐ sir!

476
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,550
請從那里出來  這里屬于私人財產
Please step away from there, that's private property.

477
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,720
是啊  哥們  那東西是隱私
Yeah, man, that stuff's confidential.

478
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,300
-不  你看  -我想是吧
- No‐‐ look. ‐ I think.

479
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,020
這個  看見了嗎
This. You see?

480
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,260
這就是她的名字
That's her name right there.

481
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,850
這是她的名字  她入住了
That's her name, she's checked in.

482
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,520
她在哪  切斯特  你對她做了什么
Where is she, Chester, what'd you do with her?

483
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,850
出什么事了嗎  拉瑞
Is something wrong, Larry?

484
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,320
-看見了嗎  -放松一點
‐ Huh, you see? ‐ Just relax and just‐‐

485
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,560
等等  你為什么攥著拳頭  拉瑞
wait, why you making a fist here, Larry?

486
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,490
老天  天哪
Oh! Oh, man! Ow, God!

487
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,320
你干了什么
What did you do?

488
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,690
我都沒碰他
I didn't touch him!

489
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,150
先生  你還好嗎
Sir, you all right?

490
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,820
我什么也沒做
I didn't do anything!

491
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,530
-先生  你還好嗎  -真沒料到
- Sir, are you all right? ‐ I didn't see that coming.

492
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,580
先生  你還好嗎  發生什么了
Sir, are you okay? What happened?

493
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,540
拉瑞  他打我
Larry. He hit me.

494
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,210
你不會真的打了他吧
Did you seriously just punch him?

495
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,990
-我妹妹在哪...  -別想了
‐ Where the fuck is‐‐ ‐ Not again.

496
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,710
先生  我得把你帶回局里
Sir, I'm gonna have to take you in.

497
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,670
拉瑞
Larry?

498
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,210
瑞秋
Rachel?

499
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,970
拉瑞  怎么回...
Larry! What the‐‐

500
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,560
女士  請別動
Ma'am, stay there.

501
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,890
他要跟我一起回局里
He's coming with me.

502
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,510
警官  讓他走吧
Officer, let him go.

503
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,640
這是我的錯
It's my fault.

504
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,730
這個男人剛襲擊了你
This man just assaulted you.

505
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,160
是我逼人太甚
Oh, I... I pushed him too far,

506
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,320
我整晚都在逗他
I've been winding him up all night.

507
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,240
老實說  我有點犯渾
Quite frankly, I've been a dick and

508
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,960
偷襲我的這拳算是便宜我了
I deserve a lot worse than getting sucker‐punched.

509
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,660
這么說你不打算起訴他
So you're not gonna press charges?

510
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,250
如果說這里有誰有罪  那也是我
If anyone's guilty of anything here, it's me,

511
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,330
搞了些沒品位的惡作劇
of bad taste and shenanigans.

512
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,010
別想鬧事  聽到了嗎
You gonna behave, son, hm?

513
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,960
聽到了
Yes.

514
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,520
感謝上帝你沒事
Thank God he's okay.

515
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,470
我不知道你倆是什么情況
Now, I don't know what's going on with you two,

516
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,940
但如果今晚我再回來
but if I got to come back here tonight,

517
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,640
我就把你倆都帶走
I'm taking you both in.

518
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,940
-女士  -晚安
- Ma'am. ‐ Uh, goodnight.

519
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
他為難你了嗎
Is he giving you a hard time?

520
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
是的  他一整晚都在耍我
Yeah, he's been playing these jokes on me all night.

521
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,070
拉瑞  太棒了  太棒了
Larry, that was great, that was great.

522
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,620
剛才那是什么情況
What the hell was that about, huh?

523
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
拉瑞非常擔心你
Well, Larry was really worried about you,

524
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,030
然后他崩潰了給治安官打了電話
and then he freaked out and called the sheriff,

525
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,500
然后我使出了愚人節耍人招數
and then I pulled this great April Fools prank

526
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,790
并讓警察走了
and got him to leave.

527
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,540
你叫治安官來抓他
You called the sheriff on him?

528
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,830
是的  我以為他對你做了什么
Yes, I thought that he did something to you.

529
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,830
什么叫做"對我做了什么"
What do you mean, did something to me?

530
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,220
-我就在這  好嗎  -好吧
- I'm right here, okay? - Okay, well,

531
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,100
他知道你的名字  我不知道他
he knew your name, I didn't know that he‐‐

532
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,220
就是...
it's just...

533
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,430
{\an8}瑞秋·亞當姆斯
到店日期  2019年4月1日
到店時間  晚間入住
離店日期  2019年4月2日

534
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,600
拉瑞  這是網上預定
Well, Larry, it's an online reservation.

535
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,770
我得寫下名字才能訂房間
You know, I had to put my name down to book the room.

536
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,810
它自己打印出來了
It prints out by itself.

537
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,610
我猜我該好好盯著  對吧
I guess I should do a better job of keeping an eye on that, huh?

538
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,400
好吧  放松
Humph. Hey, relax.

539
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,730
這是...
This is...

540
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,190
放松
Hey, relax.

541
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,030
看著我
Look at me.

542
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,350
-你怎么這么久才來  -天  發生了場大車禍
‐ What took you so long? ‐ Oh, God, there was a big accident,

543
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,910
我被堵在高速上于是我繞了一下
I got stuck on the freeway and I tried to do a detour.

544
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,840
迷路了  結果我想給你發信息
Got really lost, and then I tried to text you

545
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,170
但信息又發不出來
and it wouldn't send through.

546
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,250
我們忘掉這整件事吧  聽到了嗎
We're gonna forget this whole thing ever happened, you hear me?

547
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,460
你去好好睡一覺
And you're gonna get some sleep.

548
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,420
充充電  好好享受  房錢算我的
Recharge and enjoy the room on me,

549
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,180
盡管你偷襲給了我一拳
even though you sucker‐punched me.

550
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,050
我沒有
I didn't.

551
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,480
你不需要和我握手
You don't have to shake my hand,

552
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,510
握手早就難表我們的情誼了  哥們
we're way beyond handshakes, buddy.

553
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,900
你也可以免費入住
And you could have a room for free too,

554
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,270
因為長得太美了
just for being so beautiful.

555
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,740
好吧  我不知道是怎么回事
Wow, okay, I don't really know what's happening,

556
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,860
但我喜歡
but I like it.

557
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,330
-我回房間了  -等等
‐ I'm gonna go to my room. - Uh, wait, um.

558
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,950
一開始見到你感覺很不爽
It was really upsetting meeting you at first,

559
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,700
但現在你看上去還不錯
but you seem lovely now.

560
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,200
大家都這么說
A common refrain.

561
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
我懷疑這是不是他本人
I wonder if this is actually him.

562
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,080
不  這是性騷擾
No, it's sexual harassment is what it is.

563
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,630
"真好笑"
Ha ha.

564
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,350
我覺得不覺得這有趣
I just don't think that he's funny.

565
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,430
他也可以這么說你
Well, he could say the same thing about

566
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,800
叫警察來查他  你知道嗎
you calling the cops on him, you know?

567
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,430
聽著  我差不多算道過了歉
No, look, I mean, I kind of apologized.

568
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,270
好吧  也許他沒有我想的那么壞
Okay, maybe he's not as bad as I thought.

569
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,640
這個婚禮讓我心神不寧  知道嗎
This wedding's really just messing with my head, you know?

570
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,940
我知道  來一口
I know. Here.

571
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,020
一切都會好的
It's gonna be all right, okay?

572
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,570
而且你應該把這個給辛迪
And you should give Cindy this.

573
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,960
-拿著  -我們應該請他去婚禮嗎
- Take it. ‐ Should we invite him to the wedding?

574
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,710
三個火槍手
The Three Amigos?

575
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,950
走開
Go away!

576
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,750
"你好  辛迪
"Hey, Cindy.

577
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,630
這是我的巨根朋友切斯特
This is my giant cocked friend Chester.

578
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,130
你個操親戚的婊子"
You cousin‐fucking bitch."

579
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,930
去吧  去開門
Go! Go get it!

580
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,690
是切斯特
It's Chester.

581
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,400
那開門吧
Well, open it.

582
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,610
-不  把燈關了  -他會看到了  老兄
‐ No, shut off the lights! ‐ He'll see, dude!

583
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,190
也許他能明白
Maybe he'll get the hint.

584
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,110
馬上來
We're coming!

585
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,500
抱歉打擾  只是想來送幾杯酒
Sorry for interrupting, just dropping off a couple drinks.

586
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,170
我猜今晚這些事后你們需要喝上一杯
Thought you might need them after the night you've had.

587
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,380
免費的
On the house.

588
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,880
晚安
Have a good night.

589
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,920
快說謝謝  他要走了
Say thank you, he's going.

590
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,590
等等  切斯特
Um, hey, hey, Chester?

591
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,720
謝了  哥們  這很貼心
Thanks, man, this is‐‐ it's really nice.

592
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,650
聽著
And... listen,

593
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,600
再次抱歉  關于...
I'm sorry again about...

594
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,650
喊警察
Calling the cops?

595
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,070
打我臉
Punching me in the face?

596
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,110
別在意
Don't worry about it.

597
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,410
好吧
Okay. Uh...

598
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,870
不如我們和你一起喝一杯吧
Hey, why don't we join you for a drink?

599
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,420
不了  太晚了
Nah, it's late.

600
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,080
來吧  哥們  就一杯
Come on, dude, just one drink.

601
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,590
行吧  一杯
All right, one drink!

602
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,130
就一杯  兩杯可不行
Just one, though, not two.

603
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,300
也許可以來九杯
Maybe nine.

604
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,640
我只是逗你玩呢
I'm just fucking with you.

605
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,060
我們可以來12杯  如果你愿意
We could have 12 if you want,

606
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,220
我都準備好了
I'm all set up.

607
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,510
好的
All right.

608
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,220
你想在那見嗎
You want to meet there?

609
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,480
-所以你得留下它  -是的
- Aw, so you had to leave him. ‐ Yeah.

610
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,400
赫拉克勒斯只能和媽媽住在一起
Hercules had to stay with our mom.

611
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,070
那邊不是很有禪意
It wasn't very zen out there.

612
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,870
我大概是西藏最沒有禪意的人了
I was basically the least zen person in Tibet.

613
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,950
我從沒冥想過
I've never been much for meditation.

614
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,370
我有過一個前女友想偷走我的心
I had an ex try to steal my mind once,

615
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,290
所以我只能偷走她的身體
so I had to steal her body.

616
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,800
這是個玩笑
It was a joke.

617
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,710
拜托  各位  放輕松點
Come on, guys, lighten up!

618
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,630
我上周還幫著她看狗來著
I just watched her dog last week.

619
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,760
她是個大婊子
She's a big bitch.

620
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,140
狗也很肥
Dog was fat, too.

621
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,690
你有正經的時候嗎  還是...
So are you ever serious, or...

622
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,850
老天  醫生來了
Oh boy, the doctor's in.

623
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,980
讓我躺在沙發上
Let me just lay on the couch.

624
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,860
我要手淫兩次然后明早打給你
I'll take two hand jobs and call you in the morning.

625
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,450
你這笑話講得亂七八糟
The structure of that joke doesn't even make sense.

626
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,650
如果我是醫生  應該是我給你開手淫的處方
Like, if I'm the doctor, I should be the one prescribing the hand jobs.

627
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,040
終于開竅了
Now we're getting somewhere.

628
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,470
這家伙怎么回事  小瑞
So what's this guy's deal, Rach?

629
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,170
他一直是這么一絲不茍嗎
Has he always been, you know, uptight?

630
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,800
你應該見見他小時候的樣子
Oh, you should have seen him when he was a kid.

631
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,390
他是最幽默最快樂的小孩了
He was the funniest, happiest little guy.

632
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,890
每分鐘都在歡笑
Couldn't go two minutes without laughing.

633
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,640
大家都喜歡他
And everyone adored him.

634
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,350
后來怎么了
So what happened to him?

635
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,700
那個拉瑞還存在
Well, that Larry is still there,

636
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,320
只是現在只有我才能偶爾見見他
it's just that I'm the only one that gets to see it sometimes.

637
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,530
或也許他就是個混蛋
Or maybe he's just an asshole.

638
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,780
也許吧
Maybe.

639
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,420
他拿到啦
Whoa! He got it.

640
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,790
別秀了  你倆
Okay, you two.

641
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,170
我也希望自己能和誰這么親密
I wish I had that kind of closeness with somebody.

642
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,880
你是什么來頭  切斯特
So what is your story, Chester?

643
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
沒什么來頭
No story.

644
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,010
我就是個愛享受生活的家伙
I'm just a good‐time guy.

645
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,140
小酌幾口  大笑幾聲
A few drinks, a few laughs.

646
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,650
雞尾酒的制造者
I'm a maker of cocktails

647
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,940
玩笑的供應商
and a purveyor of jokes.

648
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,900
說實話  我一點也沒受傷
To be honest, I'm not fucked up at all.

649
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,030
敬新朋友
To new friends.

650
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,590
*我們將攜手共進*
*We'll be holding hands*

651
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,120
*直到世界末了*
*Until the end of time*

652
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,300
這次調得非常特殊
This is a very special batch.

653
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,640
不不不  我喝不了了
No, no, no, no, no, no, I can't do another one.

654
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,510
不不
No, no, no, no!

655
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,770
這次婚禮的真實故事是什么  老兄
So what's the real story with this wedding, man?

656
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,100
什么意思
Uh... like, how do you mean?

657
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,650
你看上去很沉重
You got a real heaviness about you.

658
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,740
整個人都緊張兮兮的
Your aura is all fumbled.

659
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,280
感覺你迫切地想釋放些什么
Feel like you're dying to let something out.

660
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,580
跟我說實話
Level with me.

661
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,960
就是  就是這個姑娘
It's just... it's just this girl.

662
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,590
她叫什么名字
What's her name?

663
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,340
辛迪·休斯
Cindy Hughes.

664
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,930
她是唯一一個我想娶的姑娘
She's the only girl I ever wanted to marry.

665
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,230
但她甩了我
But she dumped me

666
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,360
在我想求婚的前一天
the day before I was gonna propose.

667
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,780
現在呢  她明天就要結婚了
And now, she's getting married tomorrow.

668
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,200
她要嫁給誰
Who's she marrying?

669
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,330
你不會相信的
You're never gonna believe this.

670
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,830
我的大哥
My first cousin.

671
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,090
我一直在想
You know, I keep wondering,

672
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,000
有什么比這更丟臉呢
like, what's more humiliating to

673
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,310
去參加婚禮  所有人都知道我們的關系
to go and know that everyone knows

674
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,050
不去參加
or to not go,

675
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,560
所有人又會在背后嘲笑我
knowing that everyone there is gonna be secretly laughing at me?

676
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,060
你需要做的  就是笑到最后
What you need to do is have the last laugh.

677
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,280
這場游戲要結束了  老兄
That's the end game, man.

678
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,030
失敗者這樣才能轉敗為勝
That's how the loser... wins.

679
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,370
你知道嗎
You know,

680
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,130
其實我在思考做點什么
actually I was thinking about doing something.

681
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,510
在辛迪把我甩了之后
After Cindy dumped me,

682
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,430
我寫了一封信來斷絕我們的關系
I wrote the letter to end all letters.

683
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,400
我從沒鼓起勇氣把信交給她
Just never had the guts to give it to her,

684
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,640
但明天
but tomorrow,

685
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,270
明天我會給她的
tomorrow I will.

686
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,480
在她說出"我愿意"之前
Right before she says, "I do."

687
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,780
我能看看嗎
Can I see it?

688
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,450
拜托  拉瑞  讓我看看
Come on, Larry, let me see it.

689
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,200
我們好不容易有時間了  拉瑞
We're having a moment here, Larry.

690
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,920
來吧  拉瑞  讓我看看
Come on, Larry, let me see it.

691
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,830
你不會再見到我了
You're never gonna see me again.

692
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,540
如果你抓住了正能量
I'll tell you if I think you...

693
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,510
我會告訴你的
captured the right energy.

694
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,680
我不會讓別人看的
I've never let anyone read it.

695
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,600
連瑞秋都不行
Not even Rachel.

696
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,400
致辛迪  我不擅長言語
"Dear Cindy, words are really not my thing.

697
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,820
辛迪  我愛你  我從來沒有那么愛過一個人
Cindy, I love you, I've never loved anyone..."

698
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,290
我愛你  小拉
Ah, I love you, Lar.

699
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,040
寫的太棒了  老兄
That's fucking beautiful, man.

700
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,710
這會折磨死她的
It's gonna crucify her.

701
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,300
現在幾點了
What time is it?

702
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,060
我不知道  很晚了
Uh, I don't know, it's late.

703
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,690
邦佐該睡覺了
Well, uh, bedtime for Bonzo.

704
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,910
我也要回去工作了
Yeah, I should probably be getting back to the desk.

705
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,070
天知道我錯過了多少客戶
Who knows how many customers I've missed.

706
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,610
好吧  晚安
All right, good night.

707
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,070
等一下
Oh, wait one sec.

708
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,910
我要給你照張相  你能過來嗎
I need to get a picture of you, can you come here?

709
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,790
不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

710
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,280
我看起來像個矮松餅
I look like a scrub muffin.

711
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,920
別說了  你很好看
Shut up, you look amazing.

712
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,160
笑一笑  寶貝們
Smile, babies.

713
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,430

00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,210
晚安
Good night.

這張照片里的我很棒
That's a great picture of me.

716
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,380
但是...  就是...

晚安  拉拉寶貝
Good night, Lar‐Bear.

我愛你  拉瑞
I love you, Larry.

719
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,240
{\an8}接受好友申請

00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,740

721
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,490
什么鬼
What... the fuck?!

722
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,700
什么情況  不
What the hell, come on, no!

723
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,830
天啊
Jesus!

724
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,960
誰把你變成這樣了
Who would do this to you?

725
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,980
-誰在...  -天啊
‐ Who is‐‐ oh, ah. ‐ Jesus.

726
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,520
-不  貝蒂  -這個人是誰
- Oh, no, Betty! ‐ Who is this guy?

727
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,940
-他只是個騎摩托車的  -貝蒂  不
- He's just this biker guy. ‐ Betty, no!

728
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,610
看起來切斯特這次太過了
It looks like Chester went too far this time.

729
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,200
是誰...  是誰干的
Who would‐‐ who would do this to you?

730
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,200
不  不  貝蒂
Not‐‐ not Betty!

731
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,620
你個該死的混蛋
You goddamn son of a bitch!

732
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,990
有問題嗎  杰拉德
Is there a problem, Gerald?

733
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,540
我發誓
I swear to fucking Christ,

734
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,540
我一定要把這人的頭擰下來
I'm gonna tear someone's fucking head off.

735
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,000
有人把你的坐騎"干了"啊
Oh, someone put a crotch on your crotch rocket.

736
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,590
是你干的嗎
Did you do this?

737
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,470
你認為這很好笑嗎
You think this is funny?

738
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,970
至少你不會和其他人的車搞混了
Oh, at least you won't mix it up with anyone else.

739
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,640
天啊
Jesus.

740
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,490
-不好笑  兄弟  -二位
- Not funny, man. - Guys.

741
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,780
-操你媽  -二位  二位  別打了
- Fuck you! - Guys, guys, stop it.

742
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,730
-是誰干的  -我們能聊聊嗎
- Who would do this? ‐ Can we just talk about this?

743
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,770
你也想試試嗎  小伙子
You want some of this, little man?

744
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,320
我要打死你  老兄
I'm gonna cut you up, man.

745
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,790
他在干什么
What's he doing?

746
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,670
切斯特
Chester.

747
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,310
我  只  是
I... was... just...

748
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,720
在逗  你  玩
fucking... with... you!

749
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,470
老天  老天
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

750
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,900
杰拉德  你還好嗎
Gerald, are you okay?

751
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,950
杰拉德  有點過分了  兄弟
Gerald, things got carried away, man.

752
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,320
你還好嗎  兄弟
Are you okay, man?

753
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,370
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

754
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,370
你還好嗎
You okay?

755
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,910
你還好嗎  兄弟
You okay, man?

756
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,500
拜托  切斯特  拜托
Please, Chester, please.

757
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,460
你需要學會接受玩笑
You need to learn to take a joke.

758
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,340
切斯特
Chester.

759
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,640
你還好嗎  杰拉德
You okay, Gerald?

760
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,930
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

761
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,100
各位  我不覺得他還好
You guys, I don't think he's all right.

762
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,240
杰拉德  杰拉德
Gerald, Gerald!

763
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,230
發生了什么
What happened?

764
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,610
不
Ｏh, no.

765
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,490
該死  不
Oh, fuck, no.

766
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,240
他有把刀
He had a knife.

767
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,830
你看見了  對吧
You saw, right?

768
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,290
他要殺了我
He was gonna kill me.

769
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,290
杰拉德
Gerald!

770
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:55,960
他死了
He's dead.

771
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,670
我把他殺了
I killed him.

772
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,470
該死  我殺人了
Holy fuck, I fucking killed someone.

773
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,970
我們得報警
We have to call the police.

774
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,140
不
No.

775
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,490
不會出事的
Everything's gonna be all right.

776
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,440
不  會出事了
No, it won't.

777
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,780
我會處理好的
I'll take care of it.

778
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,030
你在...
What are you‐‐

779
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,610
你在干什么
what‐‐ what are you doing?

780
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,370
-別別別  -別  拜托
- No, no no no -- - No, please.

781
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,330
我來報警
I'll call.

782
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,420
一旦這個電話打通  我的生活會徹底改變
Once I make this phone call, it's gonna change my life.

783
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,340
拉瑞  我能求你幫我個忙嗎
Larry, can I ask you to do something for me?

784
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,510
可以
O‐okay.

785
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,470
你能給我拿點伏特加嗎
Will you go get me some vodka?

786
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,600
伏特加
Some vodka?

787
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,810
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

788
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,600
長途跋涉前的最后一杯酒
One last drink before the long walk.

789
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,980
好的  沒問題
All right, okay.

790
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,330
喂  警察局嗎
Hello, Sheriff's Department?

791
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,370
粉紅汽車旅館這里發生了一起慘案
There's been a tragedy at the Pink Motel.

792
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,960
我朋友死了
My friend is dead.

793
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,630
這是場意外
It was an accident.

794
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,090
{\an8}辦公室

795
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,020
天啊  我不敢相信現在發生的事情
Holy shit, I can't believe what the hell is happening right now.

796
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,190
我們得報警
We have to call the cops.

797
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,680
趕快
Now.

798
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,060
他說他已經報警了
He said that he was calling them already.

799
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,230
你覺得他真的報警了嗎
You think he really made that call?

800
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,910
不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

801
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,120
把你手機給我
Give me your phone.

802
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,360
把你手機給我
Give me your phone.

803
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,700
天啊  快點
God, come on.

804
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,660
-快打快打  -我在打
‐ Call, call, call, call, call. ‐ I am, I am.

805
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,420
911  你有什么緊急情況
9‐1‐1, what's your emergency?

806
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,960
你好
Hello, hi, uh, yeah,

807
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,130
我現在在粉紅汽車旅館酒廊
I'm calling from the Pink Motel and Lounge.

808
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,000
-我想上報...  -是的
‐ I wanted to report‐‐ - Um, yes,

809
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,550
治安官已經在路上了
the sheriff's already on his way.

810
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,760
你現在有危險嗎
Are you currently in danger?

811
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,590
現在沒有  但是
No, not this second, no, but, um, uh,

812
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,420
你能不能讓他快一點
can you just make sure that he‐‐he's quick?

813
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,220
好的  我會告訴他的
Yes, I'll let him know.

814
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,380
好的  謝謝你
Okay, thank you.

815
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,590
我猜你是對的  他確實報警了
I guess you were right, he, uh, he made the call.

816
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,760
你在干什么
What are you doing?

817
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,970
我在給他拿伏特加
I'm‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm getting him that‐‐ that vodka.

818
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,140
什么
What?

819
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,440
我的天  我的天
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

820
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,900
看起來你們是約翰尼和雪莉
Looks like it's Johnny and Sherrie.

821
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,960
我知道你們現在可能在想
Now I know you're probably thinking

822
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,880
這對老夫婦慘死于
this elderly couple was horrendously murdered

823
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,830
他們自己經營的旅館里
in the motel that they owned and operate.

824
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,380
你們猜對了  他們確實被殺了
And you're right, they were.

825
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,050
但不是被我殺的
But not by me.

826
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,140
原來約翰尼是世界級的變態
Turns out Johnny here was a world‐class pervert.

827
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,980
我喜歡看他們做愛
I like to watch 'em fuck.

828
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,270
他每個房間都裝有隱藏攝像頭
He had hidden cameras installed in every room.

829
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,810
傻缺們都不知道我在看著他們
Dumb fucks don't know I'm watching.

830
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,240
多年來他一直逍遙法外
And he was getting away with it for years

831
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,320
直到善良的老切斯特出現
until good old Chester came along

832
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,120
然后意識到丹麥有些地方爛透了
and realized that something was rotten in the state of Denmark.

833
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,530
我想明白了
I figured it out!

834
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,790
所以我和他當面談了這件事
So I confronted him about it!

835
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,660
你是個壞人  約翰
You're a bad man, John!

836
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,590
我這么做的時候  雪莉感受到了背叛
And when I did, Sherrie felt the years of betrayal

837
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,090
這么多年她竟然不知道她的丈夫是個變態
of not knowing that her husband was a pervert

838
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,920
然后她拿出了一把刀
and she took out a knife.

839
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,800
我要殺了你
I'm gonna kill you!

840
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,590
然后她開始捅約翰尼
And she started stabbing Johnny.

841
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,430
我要先殺了你  婊子
Not if I kill you first, bitch!

842
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,420
然后他開始掐她脖子
And he started strangling her.

843
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,430
他們兩個就在這里
And there they were, both of them,

844
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,680
交織在一起  擁抱著死去
intertwined in this... embrace of death.

845
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,970
互相殺了對方
Killing each other.

846
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,950
這是我這輩子見過的
It was the most honest expression of marriage

847
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,520
對婚姻最純粹的表達
I've ever seen in my life.

848
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,660
但你們要相信我與這無關
But you gotta believe I didn't have anything to do with it.

849
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,870
你們相信我嗎
Do you believe me?

850
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,130
我相信你  切斯特
Yeah, I believe you, Chester.

851
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,000
我倒杯酒給你
Let's get you that drink, huh?

852
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,630
我就知道我沒喜歡錯你
I knew there was a reason I liked this girl.

853
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,390
一人一杯
Shots all around.

854
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,940
你不會讓我自己喝的
Well, you're not gonna make me drink this by myself.

855
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,780
我是對的
I was right.

856
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,950
杰拉德怎么說的來著
What was it that Gerald said?

857
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,450
別人給你倒的酒  你卻不喝
It's rude to leave a drink that...

858
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,740
這很沒有禮貌
someone poured for you.

859
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,750
對了  你還沒告訴我你妹妹的名字
Oh, by the way, you never told me your sister's name.

860
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,670
我看了你臉書的主頁
I looked on your Facebook page.

861
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,710
快跑
Run!

862
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,060
該死  我的鑰匙在房間里
Fuck, my keys are in the room.

863
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,260
我的也在
Mine too.

864
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,810
我的房間  我的房間
My room, my room.

865
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,350
在這里
Over here.

866
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,640
我的天啊
Oh my God.

867
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,140
該死  鑰匙在哪兒
Fuck, where the fuck are they?

868
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,370
我怎么會知道
How am I supposed to know?

869
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,740
-該死  -不
- Fuck. - No!

870
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,160
糟糕
Oh, shit.

871
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,130
我的天啊  我爹天
Oh my God, oh my God!

872
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,020
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

873
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:20,960
你在干什么
What are you doing?

874
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,990
怎么了
What?

875
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,550
他還在那里
He's still there.

876
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,190
天啊
Oh, God.

877
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:40,900
我的天  我的天
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

878
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,070
天啊
Oh, God.

879
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,170
{\an8}粉紅汽車旅館

880
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,100
我們得提醒治安官
We have to warn the sheriff.

881
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,080
算了吧  治安官討厭我
Fuck that, that sheriff hates me.

882
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,700
治安官  你得幫幫我們
Sheriff, you have to help us!

883
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,750
別過來
Don't move.

884
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,840
什么  不
What? No.

885
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,420
不不不  我們之前跟您見過面  記得嗎
No, no, no, it's just us from before, remember?

886
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,690
你們兩個趴在地上  快點
The two of you on the ground now.

887
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,100
你沒明白
You don't understand.

888
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,250
他已經瘋了
He is crazy.

889
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,910
我給你們三秒鐘
All right, you've got to the count of three.

890
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:32,950
一
One.

891
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:35,640
-二  -好吧
- Two. - Okay.

892
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,340
-三  -感謝你能過來  治安官
- Three. - Thank you for coming, Sheriff.

893
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,650
我的天  先生  你還好嗎
My God, sir, are you all right?

894
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,480
發生了什么
What happened?

895
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,630
她用酒瓶子砸了我的腦袋
She hit me in the head with a bottle.

896
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,630
你用酒瓶子砸他腦袋了嗎
Did you hit him in the head with a bottle?

897
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,420
是的
Yes.

898
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,220
但他殺了餐廳里的人
But... he killed those people in the diner,

899
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,970
而且他殺了人  尸體就在...
aAnd he killed a guy, the body's just...

900
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,380
該死
God damn it.

901
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:05,920
天啊
Oh, God.

902
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,850
我早就應該把你們關起來
I knew it was a bad idea not to take you in earlier.

903
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,730
臉朝下
Face down.

904
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,990
趕緊  趴在地上  快點
Right now, on the ground, now!

905
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,710
警官  不是我們干的
Officer, it wasn't us.

906
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,190
我要因為你幫助和教唆了一個白癡逮捕你
I'm taking you in for aiding and abetting an idiot.

907
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,290
站住  站住
Hey, hey, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!

908
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,560
拉瑞
Larry!

909
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,330
別電了
Stop it, stop!

910
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,350
拜托停下來
Please stop!

911
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:39,850
你在笑什么
What are you laughing at?

912
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,230
我在逗你玩呢
I'm just fuckin' with you.

913
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,220
這是無價的
That was priceless.

914
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:46,880
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

915
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,760
布這個局花了我很長時間
I mean, it took a lot of work to set this up.

916
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,380
我告訴過你他是個瘋子
I told you, he's a psycho!

917
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,550
把嘴閉上
Hey, shut up.

918
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,350
你會有機會說話的  好嗎
You're gonna get your chance, all right?

919
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,810
治安官  你還好嗎
Sheriff, are you okay?

920
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,490

923
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,750
治安官  治安官  我來幫你

會沒事的  會沒事的
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay.

930
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,200
我從來沒這么殺過人
Well, I never killed anyone like that before.

931
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,090
拉瑞  你得來看看
Larry, you gotta see this

932
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,350
起來  拉瑞
Get up, Larry.

933
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,720
你在干什么
What the fuck are you doing?

934
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,810

這個扳機松了  兄弟
This trigger's loose, man.

937
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,480
別再弄他了
Leave him alone!

938
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,120
停下來  停下來
Stop it, stop it!

939
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,330
不  你才應該停下來

別弄他了
Leave him alone.

941
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,120
拉瑞  我能幫你到車上去嗎  老兄

不
No.

950
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,740
那場手術很成功
The surgery was a success.

951
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,940
離我遠一點
Get the fuck away from me!

952
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,190
滾開
Get away!

953
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,590
瑞秋  你要去哪兒
Rachel, where you going?

954
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,730
我只是想讓你按時參加婚禮

我只是想讓你按時參加婚禮

我的天啊
Oh God.

969
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,780
他是個連環殺手
He's a fucking serial killer.

970
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:48,810
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

971
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,520
這個聲音是什么
What the fuck is that noise?

972
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,560
發生了什么
What's happening?

973
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,830

I can't believe it fucking worked.

984
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,570
快點  拉瑞
Come on, Larry.

985
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,570
起來  拉瑞  起來
Oh, get up, Larry, get up!

986
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,440
我現在斗志昂揚
I'm on fire.

987
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,210
天啊  拉瑞
Oh, God, Larry!

988
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:36,970
走
Go.

989
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,440
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

990
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,060
二位  等等
Hey, guys, wait up!

991
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,380
走  快走
Go, go, go.

992
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,700
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

993
01:00:58,590 --> 01:00:59,970
你在給他吸什么
What the fuck are you giving him?!

994
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,940
當然是笑氣了
Laughing gas, of course.

995
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,640
不不不不  不要
No, no, no, no, no, don't, no, no, no!

996
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,020
不許動
Don't you fucking move!

997
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,230
不
No!

998
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,950
不不不
No! No, no.

999
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,650
一  二  三
One, two, three.

1000
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,200
四
Four.

1001
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,430
你這個
You fucking...

1002
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,950
-五  -禽獸
- Five. - ...monster!

1003
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:28,730
再加一個是六
One more is six.

1004
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,190
放開我
Get off me!

1005
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,580
*乖寶寶  不要哭鬧了*
*Hush, little baby, don't say a word*

1006
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,440
*切斯特會給你買荊棘鳥*
*Chester's gonna buy you a mockingbird*

1007
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,470
你現在應該明白了  瑞秋
You should know by now, Rachel.

1008
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:54,290
我只是在逗你玩
I was just fucking with you.

1009
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,690
我死了嗎
Am I dead?

1010
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,960
朋友們  我們的特邀嘉賓醒了
My friends, our guest of honor is awake.

1011
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:28,650
女士們先生們  拉瑞·亞當姆斯
Ladies and gentlemen, Larry Adams!

1012
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,480
拉瑞  如果你滑下去
Larry, if you fall in,

1013
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,020
可是會淹死的
you're gonna drown.

1014
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,580
你現在手還動不了
You can't move your arms yet.

1015
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,810
還不到時候
It's too soon.

1016
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,610
放松  伙計
Just relax, my man.

1017
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,320
我救不了你的
I won't be able to save you.

1018
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,560
我不會游泳
I can't swim!

1019
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:44,930
你是誰
Who are you?

1020
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,120
我是法官
I am Judgment.

1021
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,340
我是憤怒
I am Wrath.

1022
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,530
你  拉瑞·亞當姆斯
And you, Larry Adams,

1023
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,620
要被法官了
have been judgmented.

1024
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,580
-根本沒這種說法  -你怎么知道  拉瑞
- That's not a word. - How do you know, Larry?

1025
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,070
你有同意替代詞嗎
Do you have a thesaurus on that raft?

1026
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,670
我好難受
I don't feel well.

1027
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,150
上帝啊  救救我
God help me.

1028
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,440
上帝一直在救你  拉瑞
God is helping you, Larry.

1029
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,630
他愛你
He loves you!

1030
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,800
是他希望你變成這樣的
This is the way He wants you to be.

1031
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,120
歡迎來到我的夏威夷盧奧  拉瑞
Welcome to my Hawaiian luau, Larry.

1032
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,310
你是我的特邀嘉賓
You are my guest of honor.

1033
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,070
這是你的金花環
Here's your golden lei.

1034
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,770
上帝啊
Oh, God.

1035
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,400
聽著  拉瑞
Listen, Larry.

1036
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,390
我和你說實話
I'm not gonna lie to ya,

1037
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,780
我讓你服下了很多死藤水
I gave you a mega dose of ayahuasca...

1038
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,000
還有些別的
and some other things.

1039
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,090
你會感到很暈
You're gonna be feeling a little woozy.

1040
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,460
你沒事吧  伙計
You okay, man?

1041
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,160
我是誰
Who am I?

1042
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,230
我們今晚齊聚一堂就是為了弄清楚
That's why we're all gathered here tonight,

1043
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,860
你到底是誰
to find out who you really are.

1044
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,070
你不會有危險的  伙計
You're in a very safe space, man.

1045
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,270
我是一名專業的薩滿
I'm a trained shaman.

1046
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,830
瑞秋在哪里
Where's Rachel?

1047
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:48,030
瑞秋沒事  伙計
Oh, Rachel's fine, man.

1048
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,020
她只是在換泳衣
She's just changing into her bathing suit.

1049
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:51,650
也許我們可以去看看她好了沒
Perhaps we can go check on her.

1050
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,370
讓我們把儀式暫停一下
Let's put the ceremony on pause.

1051
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,760
拉瑞寶貝
Listen, Lar-Bear,

1052
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,250
我還需要你為我做一件事
there's one more thing I need for you to do.

1053
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:02,180
對你的轉化非常重要
It's very important for your transition.

1054
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,860
好吧  什么事
Okay, what is it?

1055
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,620
說實在的  你今晚算是
You kinda fucked things up for me tonight,

1056
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,070
把我給毀了
if I'm being honest.

1057
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,930
我本來計劃了非常有意思的一晚
I had a fun evening planned,

1058
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,580
然后你來了
and then you came along.

1059
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,200
你簡直就是稀有物種
You're the rarest of things.

1060
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,320
什么意思
What do you mean?

1061
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:23,760
你要明白
Understand this:

1062
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,840
你是一個完全沒有幽默感的人
You're a man completely devoid of a sense of humor.

1063
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,020
你是一個暗藏毒刺的壞脾氣鬼
You're a dour curmudgeon with a scorpion sting.

1064
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,850
你就是愚人節的愚人
You're the April Fool.

1065
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,740
沒錯
I am.

1066
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,270
我知道
I know I am.

1067
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,930
我希望你告訴我
I want you to tell me,

1068
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,720
在你用毒品換來的新晉光環之下
in all your newfound, drug addled glory,

1069
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:51,810
你到底是誰
who you really are.

1070
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,620
告訴我拉瑞·亞當姆斯到底是誰
Tell me who Larry Adams is.

1071
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:58,370
不是你用來遮掩的二重身份
Not the bullshit duality that you hide behind,

1072
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,040
不是你呈現給世界的面具
not the mask you present to the world,

1073
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,570
而是真正的你
but the real you.

1074
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,430
真正的你
The real you.

1075
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,610
好吧
Okay.

1076
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,030
乖孩子
Good boy.

1077
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,340
你想坐哪里
What do you think?

1078
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,730
床上嗎
On the bed?

1079
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,590
我不知道
I don't know.

1080
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,160
床上吧
Yeah, on the bed.

1081
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,590
抱歉  我不是很會用攝像機
Sorry, I'm not much of a camera guy.

1082
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,440
好吧
Okay.

1083
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,640
好吧  我應該準備好了
Okay, I'm ready, I think.

1084
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,330
那么  來說出真相吧
So, let the truth surge through you.

1085
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,260
告訴我們倆  你到底是誰
Tell us both who you really... are.

1086
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:59,340
開拍
And action.

1087
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,390
我是一名鍵盤俠
I'm a troll.

1088
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:07,500
我
I...

1089
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:11,470
我就是一名鍵盤俠
Literally, I'm a troll.

1090
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,110
外界看來
I mean, on the outside,

1091
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:22,760
我光鮮亮麗  恭敬有禮
I'm I'm nice, I'm... meek,

1092
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:24,920
平易近人
I'm affable,

1093
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,530
但是內在
but on the inside,

1094
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:34,030
我的內心充滿污穢
my heart is full of bitterness.

1095
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,270
我從來就沒有融入過
I've never fit in.

1096
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,980
我就像一直在玻璃墻的另一面
I'm on the other side of the glass,

1097
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,290
覬覦著墻內的人們
always looking in.

1098
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,290
太棒了  伙計
This is fantastic, man.

1099
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,410
都發泄出來
Let it out.

1100
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:51,980
繼續
Continue.

1101
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,150
我小時候
You know, when I was young,

1102
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,430
我...我從來沒辦法自如地和其他孩子交流
I just...I never had the ability to talk to other kids.

1103
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,380
我從來都不知道我該說什么
I never knew what to say.

1104
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,220
我好像是囚禁在自己腦內的囚犯
It's like I'm a prisoner in my own head,

1105
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,570
于是我非常憎恨他人
and it makes me hate people.

1106
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,280
于是
So...

1107
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,960
我創建了"編譯缺陷"
I created ProgrammingFlaw.

1108
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,460
{\an8}編譯缺陷

1109
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,760
他能做到我永遠做不到的事
He could do all the things that I never could.

1110
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,640
{\an8}吃全世界最小的雞巴

1111
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,630
我能得到自由
I could be free.

1112
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,640
他按下按鍵就能摧毀別人
He can destroy people with a single push of a button.

1113
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,150
聽起來好像很厲害
Sounds like a hell of a guy!

1114
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,310
沒錯
Oh, he is.

1115
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,020
{\an8}你的死亡高潮來得更快

1116
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,130
他非常可怕
He's formidable.

1117
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:45,750
{\an8}埃博拉逼

1118
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,680
他有我擁有不了的一切
He's everything that I'm not,

1119
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,500
全世界只有他永遠支持著我
and he's the only one who ever had my back,

1120
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,900
除了瑞秋以外
Rachel aside.

1121
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,240
謝天謝地  你還擁有她
Thank God you have her.

1122
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,410
{\an8}你會孤獨死去

1123
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,130
在我內心深處
Deep down in my soul,

1124
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,190
我知道我是誰
I know who I am.

1125
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,530
你是誰
So who are you?

1126
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,560
我是編譯缺陷
I'm ProgrammingFlaw.

1127
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:23,140
卡
Scene.

1128
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,150
來握個手  伙計
Lay it on me, man.

1129
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,200
握手難表我們的情誼
We're beyond handshakes.

1130
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:52,090
你完全接受了真正強大的自己
You fully embrace the real powerful you.

1131
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,750
我為你自豪  缺陷
I'm proud of you, Flaw.

1132
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,450
你成功了
You did it!

1133
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,670
我現在能見瑞秋了嗎
Hey, can I see Rachel now?

1134
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,900
是這樣的
Here's the deal.

1135
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,330
所有動作
For every action,

1136
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,110
都會有相同的作用力和反作用力
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

1137
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,030
就是牛頓的第三定律
Newton's third law of motion.

1138
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,840
瑞秋會稱之為因果
Rachel would call it karma,

1139
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,350
拉瑞會稱之為報應
Larry would call it payback,

1140
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,740
我稱之為太他媽有趣了
I'll just call it fucking funny, man.

1141
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,730
瑞秋  出來吧
Rachel, come on out!

1142
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,420
她就在里面
She's just in there.

1143
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:10,080
不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1144
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,790
不不不
No, no, no.

1145
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,650
不
No!

1146
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:17,550
不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1147
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,660
不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

1148
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,720
瑞秋
Rachel!

1149
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,660
瑞秋  瑞秋  瑞秋
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.

1150
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,770
不
No!

1151
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,170
你說她沒事的
You said she was okay.

1152
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:39,980
你明明保證過的
You promised me.

1153
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,930
不然你沒法完成轉變  編缺陷
The transition wouldn't have worked otherwise, PFlaw.

1154
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,860
不然你什么教訓都得不到
You wouldn't have learned anything.

1155
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,760
為什么
Why?

1156
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,920
為什么不呢
Why not?

1157
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:12,690
你知道比這更有趣的是什么嗎
You want to know what's even funnier than this?

1158
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:15,520
我剛剛把你那段可悲的獨白
I just posted your pathetic confession

1159
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,700
{\an8}拉瑞·亞當姆斯
我是編譯缺陷

1160
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,350
以及那封撇腳的信發到婚禮論壇上了
and sappy letter to Cindy on the wedding forum.

1161
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,480
{\an8}親愛的辛迪
我不擅長言語
辛迪  我愛你  我從來沒有那么愛過一個人  我希望有朝一日  馬克會像你摧毀我一樣摧毀你  你會像我當初的每一天一樣痛苦  直到你根本喘不上氣

1162
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,560
精選評論

她當然不會嫁給你了
Of course she'd never marry you.

1165
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,110
滾吧  瘋子
Get a life, freak.

1166
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,960
你是不是有病"
What's wrong with you?"

1167
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,140
"你真是太可悲了"
"You're just really pathetic."

1168
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,830
這條不錯
Oh, here's a good one.

1169
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,160
就是"去死"
It just says, "Die."

1170
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,290
這是辛迪本人的回復
And here's one from Cindy herself.

1171

{\an8}辛迪·休斯跟馬克·亞當姆斯在一起
幸福  還有17個小時  #辛迪和馬克的婚禮

01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,440
"你是一個禽獸"  禽獸
"You are a monster..." ...A monster.

1175
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,000
{\an8}辛迪·休斯
你是一個禽獸  我從來就沒喜歡過你  你真可悲

1176
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,320
我從來沒有喜歡過你  "你真可悲"
I never even liked you. "You're pathetic."

1177
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,060
她真的很恨你  拉拉寶貝
She really hates you, Lar-Bear.

1178
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:14,730
怎么了
What?

1179
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,440
你知道嗎
Do you know what?

1180
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:30,970
我之前真是看錯你了
I was wrong about you.

1181
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,610
天啊  你這人真是太搞笑了
Oh my God, you are funny.

1182
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,860
我...

1183
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,810

I mean, I...I see it, man, I get it all now.

1184
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:46,390
這一切真是太天才了
All of this was genius.

1185
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:51,010
你簡直就像是莫扎特  伙計
I mean, you're like Mozart, man.

1186
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,970
你就像是喜劇界的莫扎特
You're like the Mozart of comedy.

1187
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,190
我等你說這句話等了一晚上了
I've been waiting all night for you to say that.

1188
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,540
你太逗了
You're hilarious.

1189

I mean, those guys, Gerald and the Sheriff,

1191
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,900
他們怎么回事
what is wrong with them?

1192
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,250
他們現在也應該一起笑啊
They should've been laughing too, man.

1193
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,430
那對死夫妻
Oh my God, that dead couple?

1194
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,780
他們就是活該
I mean, they just flat-out deserved it.

1195
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:26,190
等等  你現在正在拍嗎
Oh, wait, are you filming this right now?

1196
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,360
我們這些連環殺手就喜歡留紀念品
Oh, we serial killers like to keep souvenirs.

1197
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,730
編缺陷  你真是為屠殺
PFlaw, you're a breath of fresh air

1198
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,720
帶來了清流
in a slaughterhouse.

1199
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,300
但是所有的歡樂總有終點
But all good things must come to an end.

1200
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:48,980
有最后的請求嗎
Any last requests?

1201
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,890
我不想死在這里

我不想再活了

1204

我們三個
All three of us.

1206
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,450
有一座...有一座小山
I mean, there's...There's a hill

1207
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:21,490
能俯瞰整個儀式
overlooking the festivities.

1208
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,420
想象一下他們要是看到我們隆重登場
I mean, imagine the look on their dumbass faces

1209
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,680
蠢臉上會有什么表情
when we rock up.

1210
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,820
就我和瑞秋  兩個死人
I mean, just me and Rachel, dead,

1211
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,850
從山坡上滾向他們
just tumbling down a hill towards them.

1212
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,880
{\an8}馬特·黑格曼

That would be fucking hilarious.

1217
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,430
你在逗我玩嗎
Are you just fucking with me?

1218
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:50,790
你說呢
You tell me.

1219
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,520
你要去哪里
Where you going?

1220
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:08,590
我們開瑞秋的車
Let's take Rachel's car.

1221
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,070
我來開

01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,220
-你想開車嗎  -拜托  切斯特
- You want to drive? - Oh, come on, Chester.

1223
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:19,130
瑞秋絕對不會讓你開她的車
Rachel would never let you drive her car.

1224
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:21,850
瑞秋  瑞秋
Rachel! Rachel!

1225
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,870
你愿意讓切斯特開你的車嗎
Would you let Chester drive your car?

1226
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,390
瑞秋說  "不可能"
Rachel says, "No fucking way."

1227
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,210
拜托  切斯特
Come on, Chester.

1228
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:31,400
你的氣場好像有點凌亂
Your aura seems a little jumbled.

1229
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:37,370
伙計  我只想說
Look, man, I just wanted to say,

1230
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,750
謝謝你做的一切
thank you for everything.

1231

1232
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:45,650
出發
Let's roll.

1233
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,590
我要干翻所有會動的玩意
I'll fuck anything that moves!

1234
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,250
或者不會動的
Or doesn't move.

1235
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,410
抱歉  瑞秋
Sorry, Rachel.

1236
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,140
{\an8}粉紅汽車旅館

1237
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,660
瑞秋  你要上廁所嗎
Rachel, do you have to pee?

1238
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:29,060
切斯特  我能給你講個笑話嗎
Chester, can I tell you a joke?

1239
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,830
當然了  伙計
Absolutely, man.

1240
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,600
有兩個笨蛋
So there's these two idiots,

1241
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,190
開著車
and they're driving down the road.

1242
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,340
然后呢
And?

1243
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,620
他們的名字叫拉瑞和切斯特
Okay, and they're called Larry and Chester.

1244
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,280
拉瑞的妹妹坐在車后
And Larry's sister is sittin' in the back,

1245
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,410
一句話都不說
woop, not sayin' a word.

1246
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,290
我已經開始喜歡了
I like it already.

1247
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,000
瑞秋  安靜聽笑點  好嗎
Rachel, be quiet for the punchline, okay?

1248
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,990
然后拉瑞對切斯特說
And then Larry says to Chester,

1249
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,940
"如果你現在可以成為世界上的任何東西
"If you could be anything in the world right now,

1250
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,600
你會成為什么"
what would you be?"

1251
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,590
然后  然后切斯特說
And...And Chester replies,

1252
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,200
"我不知道  我要成為什么呢"
"Well, I don't know, what would I be?"

1253
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,260
我不知道  要成為什么呢
I don't know, what would I be?

1254
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,600
拉瑞說
"Well," Says Larry,

1255
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,830
"你要成為瑞秋的狗"
"You'd be Rachel's dog."

1256
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,210
瑞秋的狗
Rachel's dog?

1257
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:27,900
沒錯
Yeah, that's right.

1258
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,430
切斯特要成為瑞秋的狗  赫拉克勒斯
Chester would be Rachel's dog, Hercules.

1259
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,170
然后切斯特說
Now Chester says,

1260
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,300
我為什么要成為赫拉克勒斯
"Why would I be Hercules?"

1261
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,890
我為什么要成為赫拉克勒斯
Why would I be Hercules?

1262
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,650
拉瑞說
"Well," Says Larry,

1263
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,120
"瑞秋太愛赫拉克勒斯了
"Rachel just loved Hercules so much

1264
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,520
所以她讓它和她一起
that she had him ride up front with her

1265
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,880
坐在前座"
in the passenger seat."

1266
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,420
就是坐在你現在的這個位置
In fact, just right there in your seat right there.

1267
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,540
你實在是太貼心了  瑞秋
Oh, you're so thoughtful, Rachel.

1268
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,290
其實這樣算是違法的
I mean, it wasn't exactly legal,

1269
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:05,430
但是她就是太愛那只狗了
but she just loved that dog so much.

1270
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,780
就像她愛我一樣
Almost as much as she loved me.

1271
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,720
她總是想要保護它的安全
She always wanted to keep him safe.

1272
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:19,330
于是她改裝了這輛車
So, she made an alteration to the car!

1273
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,900
{\an8}死路

1274
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,080
笑點是什么  拉瑞
What's the punchline, Larry?

1275
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,330
笑點是什么
What's the punchline?

1276
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,290
切斯特
Oh, Chester.

1277
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,670
笑點是  為了赫拉克勒斯
The punchline is that because of Hercules

1278
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,600
瑞秋卸掉了這輛車一邊的安全氣囊
Rachel disabled the airbags on one side of the car,

1279
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:45,380
就是切斯特那邊的
Chester's side of the car.

1280
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,790
現在我要開車撞向一堵墻
Now I'm gonna drive us into a fucking wall.

1281
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:52,960
你不會的  拉瑞
You wouldn't, Larry.

1282
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,450
你說得對
You're right.

1283
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,140
拉瑞沒有這膽子
Larry wouldn't have the balls.

1284
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,730
但我是編譯缺陷
But I'm ProgrammingFlaw.

1285
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,040
