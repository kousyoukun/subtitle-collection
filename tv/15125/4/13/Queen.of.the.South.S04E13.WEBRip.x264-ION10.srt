1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,504
Previously
on  Queen of the South...

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:04,572
How do you feel about Miami?

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,806
What's not to like?

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,975
I would like you to run it.

5
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:10,811
René was like a son to me.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,581
Whoever did this will pay.

7
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,686
Emilia's not here.

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,088
But I know where to find her.

9
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,525
I can't be honest with you.

10
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,094
There are things
that you don't know

11
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:29,197
and I can't see you anymore.

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,831
You don't mean this.

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,166
I do.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,602
Judge came by my office today.

15
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,204
Teresa, he wants you dead.

16
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,838
I just want you to know.

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,407
I'm all in.

18
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,144
Lafayette killed Tony.

19
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,657
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Teresa.

20
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,528
Was it Elias?

21
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,729
No.

22
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,498
It's a local matter
that I'm handling.

23
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,770
Now that South Florida
is secured,

24
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,373
I would like you
to introduce me to your cousin,

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,075
Kostya, in New York.

26
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,178
Kostya is a very cautious man.

27
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,115
It's rare that he meets
somebody face to face.

28
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,617
He doesn't trust people
outside his circle.

29
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:24,818
I understand that.

30
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,687
I do not think you do, Teresa.

31
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,524
If Kostya pays you
a surprise visit...

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,495
He's the last person
you will ever see.

33
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,097
Set it up, please.

34
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,568
Yeah.

35
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,313
Respectfully, T. rex,

36
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,114
we just took over Miami.

37
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,649
Boaz's still working out
the kinks.

38
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,319
We're on shaky ground there.

39
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,853
Why move so fast
with the Russians?

40
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,323
Momentum.

41
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,659
If we expand with Kostya
as our partner,

42
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,695
we will be seen as strong.

43
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,933
Have we heard from Javier?

44
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,002
He's tying some loose ends.

45
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,910
It's just a couple
more miles ahead.

46
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,552
You're the only person
she wanted to talk to.

47
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,722
She tried to call you
just before

48
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,557
Randall pulled her
from the truck.

49
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,402
It was Randall who killed her?

50
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,239
Does all the dirty work.

51
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,409
Why did they take Emilia?

52
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,012
My cousin René was murdered.

53
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,050
They thought that
she had something to do with it.

54
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,855
She was a good person.

55
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,396
She had nothing to do with that.

56
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,269
Whatever you wanna do to him...

57
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,305
He deserves.

58
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,610
<i>Did you find my son?</i>

59
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,044
Not yet.

60
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,913
Went by Mendoza's bar.

61
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,948
She's hired herself an army.

62
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,351
No quiet way to get to her
unless we bring 'em all in.

63
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,288
Mendoza's smart enough
to cover her ass.

64
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,956
And we have no idea
what she's got on us.

65
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,726
Let's not poke the bear
until we have to.

66
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,362
And when we do,
we'll keep our hands clean.

67
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:51,299
Marcel will get the job done.
She won't see him coming.

68
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,533
I did come across something

69
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,402
that might give us an edge
on Mendoza.

70
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,204
Looks like she's got herself
a new business partner.

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,407
Woman, two heavies--

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,908
never seen her before.

73
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,043
Interesting.

74
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,445
Get acquainted.

75
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,447
Show her some of our
southern charm.

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,748
<i>Happy to.</i>

77
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,756
I know you want payback
for your godson's murder,

78
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,059
but I just wanna make sure

79
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,462
that darkness
isn't blinding you.

80
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,699
-Have you changed your mind?
-No.

81
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,237
But once we do this,

82
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,672
there's no going back.

83
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,009
Teresa, we're all in this game.

84
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,212
We all got blood on our hands.

85
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,383
You killed Bobby.

86
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,488
I took Birdie.

87
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,494
You and I got past that.

88
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,866
Maybe you can do the same thing
with the Judge.

89
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,636
He's kept us under his thumb
for too long.

90
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,873
I'm done with that.

91
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,643
Aren't you?

92
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:11,078
Absolutely.

93
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,615
How you wanna do it?

94
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,484
Lafayette's dirty,
but he's still a judge.

95
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,719
That means he can bring law
enforcement down on our heads,

96
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,221
and I'm not just talking
local law enforcement.

97
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,223
Feds, DEA...

98
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,692
I know.

99
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,198
We can make his death look like
a result of his own crimes.

100
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,166
Show the world
who Lafayette really is--

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,903
a corrupt killer.

102
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,738
Once he's exposed,

103
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,307
the cops and politicians
in his pocket

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,443
won't risk
investigating his death.

105
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,747
Let's get on with it.

106
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,366
It's a good plan, Teresita.

107
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,236
We catch the Judge
with his pants down.

108
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,405
He'll never see us coming.

109
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,874
He always seems to be
a step ahead of us.

110
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,576
This time, he can't be.

111
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,113
We need to talk about George.

112
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,582
He's angry.

113
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,684
Thinks we let Dumas off the hook

114
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,553
for Birdie's death.

115
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,456
We cannot have any loose cannons
right now.

116
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:31,124
The hit on the Judge
is dangerous enough.

117
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:34,061
I know.
I'll talk to him.

118
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,030
Maybe we should ask Boaz
to send some backup from Miami.

119
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,466
No.

120
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,133
Miami's not settled.

121
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,002
Boaz needs his men there.

122
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,172
Any word on Javier?

123
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,475
Not yet.

124
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,016
Is it up here?

125
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,125
Yeah.

126
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,805
What do y'all want with me?

127
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,908
You don't have
to be scared, Gina.

128
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,510
You know
who I am.

129
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,546
Ms. Mendoza's
a close friend.

130
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,550
We want to make you
an offer.

131
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,688
-Offer?
-Yes.

132
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,856
One of
Ms. Mendoza's men saw

133
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,893
Judge Lafayette
visit you.

134
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,664
Yeah, he comes to see me

135
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,499
same time every Wednesday.

136
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,267
Good.

137
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,703
That's today.

138
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,906
Is he always alone?

139
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,049
I know Lafayette
is very powerful.

140
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,320
He trusts me.

141
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,390
Kinda treats me like a pet.

142
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,962
I was doing time
for solicitation.

143
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:25,532
The Judge got me out
on early parole,

144
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,968
so he lets me know
every chance he gets

145
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,438
that he can send me back
whenever he wants.

146
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,473
You're a pet in a cage.

147
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,580
I hate him.

148
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,598
Gina, if you help us,

149
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,500
all that money is yours.

150
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,271
This is your chance
to get away from him.

151
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,840
We're offering you a new life.

152
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,777
We're gonna make it
look like a drug deal

153
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,311
gone wrong.

154
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,983
Gina.
Gina.

155
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:20,153
All you have to do is
put this in his suit jacket.

156
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,330
Okay.

157
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,001
All right.

158
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,541
Pote will hide in your house.

159
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,210
Once Lafayette arrives,

160
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,178
you need to make him
comfortable.

161
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,280
Act like everything is normal.

162
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,882
Pote will take care of him.

163
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,483
Nothing will happen to you.

164
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,487
You promise?

165
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,390
Take the money
and go as far away as you can.

166
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,333
You think she can handle it?

167
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,835
She'd better,

168
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,871
or Lafayette's gonna come at us
with everything he's got.

169
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,730
Hello?

170
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,198
<i>Davis, buddy,</i>

171
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,733
where you been
hiding yourself?

172
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,735
You can't just disappear
on your daddy like that.

173
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,203
He's been worried sick.

174
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,205
I doubt that.

175
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,874
But he should start worrying.

176
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,577
Told that girl's boyfriend
that you murdered her.

177
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,945
I showed him where--

178
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,246
I showed him
where the body is.

179
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, Davis.

180
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,050
-Slow down.
<i>-No.</i>

181
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,252
He has kept me drugged

182
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:02,022
and tried to convince me
that I was crazy.

183
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,891
He thinks he plays
by different rules.

184
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,095
Not anymore.

185
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,036
Hang tight.

186
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,407
Oh, no.

187
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,476
Cecil, you are not gonna waste
the little time we have

188
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,112
talking business on your phone.

189
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,682
I do concur with
your decision, baby.

190
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,163
Primo,  what's up?

191
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,365
Better get your ass
to Miami, cabrón.

192
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,802
Life is good here.

193
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,118
I'm on the next flight
to New Orleans.

194
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,553
<i>No,  primo.</i>

195
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,336
Javi...

196
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,483
What the devil's got into you?

197
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,818
Not that I'm complaining.

198
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,347
Dale!

199
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,882
-Go!

200
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,955
So Dumas' men
killed Birdie, huh?

201
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,391
I saw it on his face.

202
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,462
We were at war
with them, George.

203
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,032
It's over now.

204
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,768
I need to know that
you're focused.

205
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,775
It's not just about Birdie.

206
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,279
These Russians that you're
trying to get in bed with--

207
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,381
they are the nastiest,

208
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,551
most ruthless sons of bitches
that walk the Earth.

209
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,454
Are you sure you wanna
take that risk?

210
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,892
There's only one way
to be safe in this business--

211
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:56,296
to become powerful enough
that no one can touch you.

212
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,800
So New York and the Russkis--

213
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,637
that's some kind of
exit strategy?

214
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,475
It's also the center of finance,

215
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,944
a place where we can
become legitimate quickly.

216
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,449
Is it done?

217
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,090
Okay.
Pote missed.

218
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,292
-Close the bar.
-Oh, god damn it!

219
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,734
Toss the bar!

220
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,323
We rolled up the distillery.

221
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,991
No coke.
No guns.

222
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,693
No money.
Looks like she's in the wind.

223
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,963
Now, looks can be deceiving,
especially with Mendoza.

224
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,899
Keep kicking rocks.

225
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,837
Roaches run from the light.

226
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,655
Okay, well,
it isn't much to look at,

227
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,523
but I figured
that's kinda the point--

228
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,492
hide in plain sight.

229
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,794
-It's perfect.
-Great, okay.

230
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,129
Well, I rented out all the rooms

231
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,630
so you won't have
any lookie-loos,

232
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,966
and your stuff is in room number
12 if you need to freshen up.

233
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,501
Thank you.

234
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:42,935
I'll take you there.

235
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,209
Okay.

236
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,346
-Listen, Kelly Anne.

237
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,748
This war with Lafayette--

238
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,051
it's really bad.

239
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,753
I would like you to go and stay
with Chicho's mom in Uptown.

240
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,022
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my family.

241
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,425
I know it is.

242
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,195
But Teresa needs your help
with the business,

243
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,597
not with a gun.

244
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,732
Okay.

245
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,267
You be safe, you hear me?

246
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,502
I will.

247
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,779
Where you been, cabrón?

248
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,624
I know why the Judge
tried to kill you, patrona.

249
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,727
Better start talking.

250
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,799
I killed René...

251
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,237
The Judge's nephew.

252
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,341
We got into a fight
in the bathroom at the bar.

253
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,810
Hid his body
in the trunk of his car...

254
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,648
Set it on fire.

255
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,518
Randall found some evidence.

256
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,292
He took Emilia.

257
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,163
She must have lied
to protect me, patrona.

258
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,764
I think

259
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,600
she told him
you ordered the hit on René.

260
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,872
And they killed her.

261
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,914
You got Tony killed!
You almost got Teresa killed!

262
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,584
Now you will die, cabrón!

263
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,652
Wait!

264
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,961
Don't let this hijo de puta
out of your sight.

265
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,976
Javier saved my life.

266
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,078
He risked his own
trying to protect me.

267
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,781
He's been as courageous
as James.

268
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,783
But he lied to your face.

269
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,652
And so did James.

270
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,154
He wasn't exactly a saint.

271
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,790
At least Javier--he lied
to protect the woman he loved.

272
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,158
I told you
not to leave him alone!

273
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,728
Javi ain't running.
He's a cartel soldier.

274
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,199
He knows he disobeyed the boss'
orders and lied to her to boot.

275
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,569
Look, he's good
with whatever you decide.

276
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,044
We'll need him.

277
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,479
Lafayette is coming for us.

278
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,414
Not to mention Boaz runs Miami.

279
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,082
Killing his cousin--

280
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,352
that's gonna
set his hair on fire.

281
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,555
For now, he lives.

282
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,592
Dumas was right.

283
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,361
I should make peace
with the Judge.

284
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,782
Ms. Mendoza, what a coincidence.

285
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,417
You were just on my mind.

286
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,852
I know you think
I ordered your nephew's death.

287
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,854
I didn't.

288
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,623
One of my men just confessed

289
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,859
to killing René
in a fight at my bar.

290
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,529
You'll forgive me
if I find that hard to swallow.

291
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,065
You tried to kill me
and killed my godson.

292
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,635
Both of us lost family.

293
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,471
I would like to try to find
a way to put this behind us.

294
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,073
I'm open to mending fences

295
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,576
once you hand your man
over to me.

296
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,949
I won't allow that.

297
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,819
I've indulged you, Ms. Mendoza.

298
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,822
I've let you and all the
riffraff in your organization

299
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,991
walk around my city
like you belong here.

300
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:02,261
And it appears my reward
for not showing you my teeth

301
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:05,398
is you forgetting your place,
little lady.

302
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,999
Well, let me tell you something.

303
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,001
If you don't hand over your man,

304
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,804
I will hand you your head.

305
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,806
I don't respond to threats.

306
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,476
It's not a threat.
It's a promise.

307
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,514
-Teresita,

308
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,684
what you told the Judge is true.

309
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,487
Whether Javier lives or dies,

310
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,988
it's up to you.

311
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,825
What do you wanna do, Teresita?

312
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,600
I've done everything
Lafayette demanded.

313
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,535
I've paid him a lot of money.

314
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,707
If I do this now,
where does it end?

315
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,444
He knows you're after him now.
He'll just keep hitting us.

316
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,780
Then we'll hit him harder.

317
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,848
-That means hitting cops.
-Dirty cops.

318
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,050
-Murderous thieves.
-Maybe.

319
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,387
But they're his own
private army.

320
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,221
He runs this town.

321
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,692
Even if we win,
we're gonna lose a lot.

322
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,600
They'll lose more.

323
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,736
Patrona.

324
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,404
This city has been
our private Eden, Marcel.

325
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:58,377
Mendoza is an invasive species.

326
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,912
She's putting down roots.

327
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,417
You wanna cut her out.

328
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,919
I need your answer.

329
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:09,255
Are you with me?

330
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,924
Of course.

331
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,860
You're the devil I know.

332
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,664
You know where she is?

333
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,132
Yeah.

334
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,269
She's holed up with her people
at a safe location.

335
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,105
Cedric and my crew--
they're sitting on her now.

336
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,108
-They'll help your boys out.
-No, Randall can handle it.

337
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,744
No.
I'm sorry, Judge.

338
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,447
I'm not taking any chances
this time.

339
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,149
My boys'll make sure
that nothing goes wrong

340
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,752
with the hit on Mendoza.

341
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,027
This war ends today.

342
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,774
I did the recon.
Teresa Mendoza's here.

343
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,117
How many men are with her?

344
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,453
Four.
The place is isolated.

345
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,188
Only one way in or out.

346
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:19,025
-So we got 'em boxed in--
-And outnumbered.

347
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,027
Like shooting fish
in a barrel, man.

348
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,131
Let's not start
stroking each other just yet.

349
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,035
Get your boys together.

350
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,647
Fall back!
Fall back!

351
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,235
Dumas set us up!

352
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,417
He's running away!

353
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,664
Hey, we get 'em all?

354
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,167
Almost.

355
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,469
What the hell, man?
Hm?

356
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,838
Why'd you do Birdie that way?

357
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,473
Birdie?

358
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,476
I was just
following orders, man.

359
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,911
Mm-hmm.

360
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,339
I'm a soldier, same as you.

361
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,775
-Kay?

362
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,977
She was a civilian.

363
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,378
I know.

364
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,014
It was messed up.

365
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:30,717
See, but you do this,
it all starts up again.

366
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,284
Okay?

367
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,024
It's Lafayette.

368
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,730
<i>So now you're a cop killer,</i>

369
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:19,198
Ms. Mendoza.

370
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,269
Those men weren't cops.

371
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,772
I learned early on
how dangerous it is

372
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:28,707
to underestimate you, hm?

373
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,277
So I bought myself
a little insurance.

374
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,678
Do tell me.

375
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,713
Have you spoken to your
Russian friend lately?

376
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,785
Say hello, darling.

377
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,154
Hello, Teresa.

378
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,124
They grabbed me from my hotel.

379
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,829
His cop shot two of my men.

380
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,801
Is the picture
becoming clear now?

381
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,903
Do you know who
she's connected to?

382
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,938
Oh, I have a pretty good idea.

383
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,274
They will hunt you down
and kill you.

384
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,276
They don't care who you are.

385
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,979
And you'll be right there
beside me, darling.

386
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,715
Mutually-assured destruction--

387
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,352
unless you give me
my nephew's killer.

388
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,823
I expect an answer
by midnight.

389
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,674
-Patrona.

390
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,878
You know what you have to do.

391
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:41,981
Está bien.

392
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,351
It didn't have to be like this.

393
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,155
If you trusted me,
I could've protected you,

394
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:50,622
but now I can't.

395
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,324
Working with you, patrona...

396
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,735
I owe that to you.

397
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,571
Salud.

398
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,075
They're here.

399
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,678
Let them in.

400
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,556
Everybody just breathe easy.

401
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,991
Hands where I can see 'em.

402
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,692
You're not here as the law.

403
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,030
You know why I'm here,
Ms. Mendoza.

404
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,233
Let's put an end to all this.

405
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,378
I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

406
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,058
I was right, patrona.

407
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,363
We were crazy to think
we would have

408
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,398
something different
in this life.

409
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,887
Let's go.

410
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,600
Are you okay?

411
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,603
Yeah.

412
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,929
Oh, Davis,
you had me worried sick.

413
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,032
You tracked my phone?

414
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,167
I know you're angry,
but I forgive you.

415
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,468
You can come back home.

416
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,270
You forgive me?

417
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,372
You defied me, Davis,

418
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,774
but you showed fortitude
I didn't know you had.

419
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,377
-It gives me hope.
-Hope for what?

420
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,147
That you're more like me
than I thought.

421
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,715
-Go to hell.
-Judge.

422
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,684
We need to wrap this up.

423
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,987
You were tricked, son.

424
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:12,891
Mendoza's man,
the one you confided in--

425
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:16,295
he's the man
who murdered your cousin.

426
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,997
You're lying.
You'd say anything to me.

427
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:22,668
Mendoza handed him over
to me herself.

428
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:26,405
He's the reason
that sweet girl died.

429
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,674
But don't you worry.

430
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,343
He gonna get
what's coming to him.

431
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,453
Let's do this, pendejo.

432
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,456
What's he saying, Randall?

433
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,326
He's saying,
"Let's do this, pendejo."

434
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:25,063
Gotta admire a man who welcomes
his own firing squad.

435
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,915
Nothing personal, amigo.

436
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,487
I actually kinda liked you.

437
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,796
Randall!

438
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:20,186
The shoot-out
in Metairie took the lives

439
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,687
of six decorated officers,
including the head

440
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,855
of the anti-gang strike team,

441
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,624
Detective Randall Green.

442
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,493
Police at this time
are calling it

443
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,328
a gang-related incident.

444
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,496
Randall is dead.

445
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,931
-Javier.
-Mm.

446
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,366
He fought to the end.

447
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,536
I'm sorry you were
pulled into this.

448
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,507
I know how much
this has cost you.

449
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,876
Do not think I am ungrateful.

450
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,933
The good news is that
you have his attention.

451
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,903
The bad news...

452
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,705
is that you have his attention.

453
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,442
So we are in business
with Kostya?

454
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,345
Yes.

455
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,714
For better or for worse.

456
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,083
Thank you.

457
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,695
The Judge is down,

458
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,430
but he's not out.

459
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,098
As long as he's breathing,

460
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,900
he's gonna be a problem for us.

461
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,736
If he loses his power,

462
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,838
he's just a man.

463
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,374
Any man can be killed.

464
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,218
Dave?

465
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,180
My son.

466
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,851
Son?
Son?

467
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,993
Oh, God.

468
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,129
What have I done?

469
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:11,990
Taza said there's
a new sheriff in Phoenix

470
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,258
that's cleaning up corruption,

471
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,160
so he's gonna need more money
for bribes.

472
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:16,628
-Send it.
-Okay.

473
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,597
-How's Miami?
-It's a little bumpy.

474
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,532
Boaz had to dispose
of a few dealers

475
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:21,667
that were causing problems.

476
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,635
You were smart
to keep extra men there.

477
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,036
What about the new bankers?

478
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,472
I'm still checking references,

479
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,707
but I did make a list of new
businesses to clean our money,

480
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,208
and I'm looking into
making an investment

481
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,777
on the waterfront property

482
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,512
as well as some
commercial real estate.

483
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,113
Great.

484
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,682
Thank you.

485
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,116
Happy to help.

486
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,353
I'm gonna get to that meeting,
but that suit is baller.

487
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,188
Thank you.

488
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,330
It's okay, Luis.

489
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,744
I heard there was an explosion
in front of your bar.

490
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:09,080
You okay?

491
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,384
Yes.
Thank you.

492
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,187
You know,

493
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,756
they said you were
in the hospital.

494
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,927
I was gonna come, but...

495
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,729
I wasn't sure you'd want me to.

496
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,265
I'm glad you didn't.

497
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:35,407
I spent the last month

498
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:38,944
putting all the pieces together
of what went down

499
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,447
between you and me.

500
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,348
I know you're not just a

501
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,151
bar owner or
a tequila distributor.

502
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,087
Tell me the truth.

503
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,093
I run a drug cartel.

504
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,730
Are you serious?

505
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,167
Every minute
you spend with me...

506
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,437
You're in danger.

507
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,441
I need you to go away.

508
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,179
Don't come back.

509
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,749
You lied to me.

510
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,017
Yes.

511
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,722
Everything else--

512
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,624
was it a lie too?

513
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,094
No.

514
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:58,189
Phoenix, Atlanta, Miami.

515
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,925
Now, New York.

516
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,460
We doubled our operation
in three months.

517
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,129
That's a lot to keep an eye on.

518
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,864
Ain't no risk it, no biscuit.

519
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,099
You staying?

520
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,535
I'ma stick around.

521
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,337
Make sure you're good
with the Russkis.

522
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,940
Hey, you might need me.
I know Chewy does.

523
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,108
Whatever you need
to tell yourself, cabrón.

524
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,564
George, call a doctor.

525
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,968
My God, James.
What happened to you?

526
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,003
They're coming for you.

527
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:48,027
