1
00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:02,452
<i>Previously
on</i> Queen of the South...

2
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:03,941
How do you feel about Miami?

3
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:05,177
What's not to like?

4
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,345
I would like you to run it.

5
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:10,182
<i>René was like a son to me.</i>

6
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,951
Whoever did this will pay.

7
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:18,055
Emilia's not here.

8
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:19,457
But I know where to find her.

9
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:23,895
I can't be honest with you.

10
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:25,464
There are things
that you don't know

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,567
and I can't see you anymore.

12
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:30,201
You don't mean this.

13
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,537
I do.

14
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,972
Judge came by my office today.

15
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:35,573
<i>Teresa, he wants you dead.</i>

16
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,208
<i>I just want you to know.</i>

17
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:38,780
I'm all in.

18
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,518
Lafayette killed Tony.

19
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:56,030
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Teresa.

20
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:59,897
Was it Elias?

21
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,098
No.

22
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:03,871
It's a local matter
that I'm handling.

23
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:09,141
Now that South Florida
is secured,

24
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,742
I would like you
to introduce me to your cousin,

25
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:14,445
Kostya, in New York.

26
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:16,551
Kostya is a very cautious man.

27
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:20,486
It's rare that he meets
somebody face to face.

28
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:22,988
He doesn't trust people
outside his circle.

29
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:24,188
I understand that.

30
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,060
I do not think you do, Teresa.

31
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:29,897
If Kostya pays you
a surprise visit...

32
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:33,868
He's the last person
you will ever see.

33
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,471
Set it up, please.

34
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,938
Yeah.

35
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:51,682
Respectfully, T. rex,

36
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:53,485
we just took over Miami.

37
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,019
Boaz's still working out
the kinks.

38
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:57,688
We're on shaky ground there.

39
00:01:57,724 --> 00:01:59,224
Why move so fast
with the Russians?

40
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,692
Momentum.

41
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:05,030
If we expand with Kostya
as our partner,

42
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:07,069
we will be seen as strong.

43
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,304
Have we heard from Javier?

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,376
He's tying some loose ends.

45
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,284
It's just a couple
more miles ahead.

46
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:30,925
You're the only person
she wanted to talk to.

47
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:34,091
She tried to call you
just before

48
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,927
Randall pulled her
from the truck.

49
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:47,776
It was Randall who killed her?

50
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,611
Does all the dirty work.

51
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,782
Why did they take Emilia?

52
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:58,387
My cousin René was murdered.

53
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:02,424
They thought that
she had something to do with it.

54
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,229
She was a good person.

55
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:14,769
She had nothing to do with that.

56
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:20,642
Whatever you wanna do to him...

57
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:23,679
He deserves.

58
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:28,980
<i>Did you find my son?</i>

59
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:30,414
Not yet.

60
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,283
Went by Mendoza's bar.

61
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,318
She's hired herself an army.

62
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:36,722
No quiet way to get to her
unless we bring 'em all in.

63
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,657
Mendoza's smart enough
to cover her ass.

64
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:42,326
And we have no idea
what she's got on us.

65
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:45,097
<i>Let's not poke the bear
until we have to.</i>

66
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,733
And when we do,
we'll keep our hands clean.

67
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,669
Marcel will get the job done.
She won't see him coming.

68
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:51,902
I did come across something

69
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:53,771
that might give us an edge
on Mendoza.

70
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:56,574
<i>Looks like she's got herself
a new business partner.</i>

71
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,776
<i>Woman, two heavies...</i>

72
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,277
<i>never seen her before.</i>

73
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,413
Interesting.

74
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,814
Get acquainted.

75
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,817
Show her some of our
southern charm.

76
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,122
<i>Happy to.</i>

77
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:15,127
I know you want payback
for your godson's murder,

78
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:18,430
but I just wanna make sure

79
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,836
that darkness
isn't blinding you.

80
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,072
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

81
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:29,608
But once we do this,

82
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,045
there's no going back.

83
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,379
Teresa, we're all in this game.

84
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:38,586
We all got blood on our hands.

85
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:41,757
You killed Bobby.

86
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:46,861
I took Birdie.

87
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:52,867
You and I got past that.

88
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,235
Maybe you can do the same thing
with the Judge.

89
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:02,009
He's kept us under his thumb
for too long.

90
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,247
I'm done with that.

91
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:09,014
Aren't you?

92
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,451
Absolutely.

93
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,985
How you wanna do it?

94
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,853
Lafayette's dirty,
but he's still a judge.

95
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,089
That means he can bring law
enforcement down on our heads,

96
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,591
and I'm not just talking
local law enforcement.

97
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:22,593
Feds, DEA...

98
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,065
I know.

99
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:30,569
We can make his death look like
a result of his own crimes.

100
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,536
Show the world
who Lafayette really is...

101
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:35,273
a corrupt killer.

102
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:37,108
Once he's exposed,

103
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:39,677
the cops and politicians
in his pocket

104
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,817
won't risk
investigating his death.

105
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,117
Let's get on with it.

106
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,273
Subtitles by explosiveskull
www.OpenSubtitles.org

107
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:03,062
It's a good plan, Teresita.

108
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:05,931
We catch the Judge
with his pants down.

109
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,101
He'll never see us coming.

110
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:10,570
He always seems to be
a step ahead of us.

111
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:12,274
This time, he can't be.

112
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:16,808
We need to talk about George.

113
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,276
He's angry.

114
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,378
Thinks we let Dumas off the hook

115
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,248
for Birdie's death.

116
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:25,151
We cannot have any loose cannons
right now.

117
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,820
The hit on the Judge
is dangerous enough.

118
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:30,755
I know.
I'll talk to him.

119
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,726
Maybe we should ask Boaz
to send some backup from Miami.

120
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,161
No.

121
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:36,829
Miami's not settled.

122
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,701
Boaz needs his men there.

123
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:41,870
Any word on Javier?

124
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:44,173
Not yet.

125
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:52,714
Is it up here?

126
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,820
Yeah.

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,500
What do y'all want with me?

128
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:24,603
You don't have
to be scared, Gina.

129
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,205
You know
who I am.

130
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,244
Ms. Mendoza's
a close friend.

131
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,248
We want to make you
an offer.

132
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,383
- Offer?
- Yes.

133
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,552
One of
Ms. Mendoza's men saw

134
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:42,592
Judge Lafayette
visit you.

135
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:47,360
Yeah, he comes to see me

136
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,194
same time every Wednesday.

137
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,962
Good.

138
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,401
That's today.

139
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:55,604
Is he always alone?

140
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:05,748
I know Lafayette
is very powerful.

141
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:10,019
He trusts me.

142
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,089
Kinda treats me like a pet.

143
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,658
I was doing time
for solicitation.

144
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:22,227
The Judge got me out
on early parole,

145
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,664
so he lets me know
every chance he gets

146
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,134
that he can send me back
whenever he wants.

147
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,171
You're a pet in a cage.

148
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,279
I hate him.

149
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,293
Gina, if you help us,

150
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,199
all that money is yours.

151
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:00,966
This is your chance
to get away from him.

152
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:03,535
We're offering you a new life.

153
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,471
We're gonna make it
look like a drug deal

154
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:08,006
gone wrong.

155
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,678
Gina.
Gina.

156
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:16,848
All you have to do is
put this in his suit jacket.

157
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,028
Okay.

158
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,700
All right.

159
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,236
Pote will hide in your house.

160
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,904
Once Lafayette arrives,

161
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,874
you need to make him
comfortable.

162
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,976
Act like everything is normal.

163
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,577
Pote will take care of him.

164
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:47,182
Nothing will happen to you.

165
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,183
You promise?

166
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:54,086
Take the money
and go as far away as you can.

167
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,028
You think she can handle it?

168
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:04,529
She'd better,

169
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,570
or Lafayette's gonna come at us
with everything he's got.

170
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:30,500
Hello?

171
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:31,969
<i>Davis, buddy,</i>

172
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:33,503
<i>where you been
hiding yourself?</i>

173
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,506
You can't just disappear
on your daddy like that.

174
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,974
He's been worried sick.

175
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,975
I doubt that.

176
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,646
But he should start worrying.

177
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,348
Told that girl's boyfriend
that you murdered her.

178
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,715
<i>I showed him where...</i>

179
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,017
<i>I showed him
where the body is.</i>

180
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,685
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, Davis.

181
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,820
- Slow down.
- <i>No.</i>

182
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:53,022
He has kept me drugged

183
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:55,791
and tried to convince me
that I was crazy.

184
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,664
<i>He thinks he plays
by different rules.</i>

185
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:01,864
Not anymore.

186
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:09,806
Hang tight.

187
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:14,176
Oh, no.

188
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:17,247
Cecil, you are not gonna waste
the little time we have

189
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,882
talking business on your phone.

190
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:23,456
I do concur with
your decision, baby.

191
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,934
<i>Primo,</i> what's up?

192
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,139
Better get your ass
to Miami, <i>cabrón.</i>

193
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,575
<i>Life is good here.</i>

194
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,888
I'm on the next flight
to New Orleans.

195
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:00,327
<i>No,</i> primo.

196
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:17,109
<i>Javi...</i>

197
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,256
What the devil's got into you?

198
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:32,589
Not that I'm complaining.

199
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,118
<i>Dale!</i>

200
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:02,655
Go!

201
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,729
So Dumas' men
killed Birdie, huh?

202
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:12,164
I saw it on his face.

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,236
We were at war
with them, George.

204
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:18,804
It's over now.

205
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,541
I need to know that
you're focused.

206
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,546
It's not just about Birdie.

207
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:33,050
These Russians that you're
trying to get in bed with...

208
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:35,152
they are the nastiest,

209
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,324
most ruthless sons of bitches
that walk the Earth.

210
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:41,227
Are you sure you wanna
take that risk?

211
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:46,662
There's only one way
to be safe in this business...

212
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:50,066
to become powerful enough
that no one can touch you.

213
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,570
So New York and the Russkis...

214
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:58,411
that's some kind of
exit strategy?

215
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:02,244
It's also the center of finance,

216
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,717
a place where we can
become legitimate quickly.

217
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,219
Is it done?

218
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,859
Okay.
Pote missed.

219
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,061
- Close the bar.
- Oh, god damn it!

220
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:28,504
Toss the bar!

221
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:50,093
We rolled up the distillery.

222
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,762
No coke.
No guns.

223
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:54,464
No money.
Looks like she's in the wind.

224
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,738
Now, looks can be deceiving,
especially with Mendoza.

225
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,674
Keep kicking rocks.

226
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,611
Roaches run from the light.

227
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,050
Okay, well,
it isn't much to look at,

228
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:21,918
but I figured
that's kinda the point...

229
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,888
hide in plain sight.

230
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:26,190
- It's perfect.
- Great, okay.

231
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:27,524
Well, I rented out all the rooms

232
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,026
so you won't have
any lookie-loos,

233
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,362
and your stuff is in room number
12 if you need to freshen up.

234
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:32,897
Thank you.

235
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:34,335
I'll take you there.

236
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:40,607
Okay.

237
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,742
Listen, Kelly Anne.

238
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:47,143
This war with Lafayette...

239
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,446
it's really bad.

240
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:52,148
I would like you to go and stay
with Chicho's mom in Uptown.

241
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:54,417
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my family.

242
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:56,821
I know it is.

243
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:59,590
But Teresa needs your help
with the business,

244
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,991
not with a gun.

245
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:04,127
Okay.

246
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:05,662
You be safe, you hear me?

247
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:06,896
I will.

248
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,178
Where you been, <i>cabrón?</i>

249
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:29,023
I know why the Judge
tried to kill you, <i>patrona.</i>

250
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:32,126
Better start talking.

251
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,194
I killed René...

252
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,635
The Judge's nephew.

253
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,738
We got into a fight
in the bathroom at the bar.

254
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,209
Hid his body
in the trunk of his car...

255
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:53,043
Set it on fire.

256
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,917
Randall found some evidence.

257
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,690
He took Emilia.

258
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:07,557
She must have lied
to protect me, <i>patrona.</i>

259
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:09,159
I think

260
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:11,996
she told him
you ordered the hit on René.

261
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,271
And they killed her.

262
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:26,309
You got Tony killed!
You almost got Teresa killed!

263
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:28,979
Now you will die, <i>cabrón!</i>

264
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:31,047
Wait!

265
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:40,356
Don't let this <i>hijo de puta</i>
out of your sight.

266
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:55,372
Javier saved my life.

267
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:57,477
He risked his own
trying to protect me.

268
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:00,177
He's been as courageous
as James.

269
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:02,179
But he lied to your face.

270
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,047
And so did James.

271
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,549
He wasn't exactly a saint.

272
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:09,185
At least Javier... he lied
to protect the woman he loved.

273
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:10,554
I told you
not to leave him alone!

274
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,127
Javi ain't running.
He's a cartel soldier.

275
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:17,598
He knows he disobeyed the boss'
orders and lied to her to boot.

276
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,967
Look, he's good
with whatever you decide.

277
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:29,440
We'll need him.

278
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:30,873
Lafayette is coming for us.

279
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:32,809
Not to mention Boaz runs Miami.

280
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,478
Killing his cousin...

281
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,750
that's gonna
set his hair on fire.

282
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:39,953
For now, he lives.

283
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,988
Dumas was right.

284
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:45,758
I should make peace
with the Judge.

285
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:07,177
Ms. Mendoza, what a coincidence.

286
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:08,812
You were just on my mind.

287
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:11,248
I know you think
I ordered your nephew's death.

288
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,249
I didn't.

289
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:15,018
One of my men just confessed

290
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:18,255
<i>to killing René
in a fight at my bar.</i>

291
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,923
You'll forgive me
if I find that hard to swallow.

292
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:24,460
You tried to kill me
and killed my godson.

293
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:27,030
Both of us lost family.

294
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,866
<i>I would like to try to find
a way to put this behind us.</i>

295
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:32,469
I'm open to mending fences

296
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:34,975
once you hand your man
over to me.

297
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:41,344
I won't allow that.

298
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,213
I've indulged you, Ms. Mendoza.

299
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:47,217
I've let you and all the
riffraff in your organization

300
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:50,386
walk around my city
like you belong here.

301
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:53,656
<i>And it appears my reward
for not showing you my teeth</i>

302
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:56,794
is you forgetting your place,
little lady.

303
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,394
Well, let me tell you something.

304
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,396
If you don't hand over your man,

305
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:03,200
<i>I will hand you your head.</i>

306
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:05,201
I don't respond to threats.

307
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:07,874
It's not a threat.
It's a promise.

308
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,910
Teresita,

309
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:16,079
what you told the Judge is true.

310
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:18,882
Whether Javier lives or dies,

311
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:20,387
it's up to you.

312
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:24,223
What do you wanna do, Teresita?

313
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,995
I've done everything
Lafayette demanded.

314
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:33,934
I've paid him a lot of money.

315
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:39,103
If I do this now,
where does it end?

316
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:42,840
He knows you're after him now.
He'll just keep hitting us.

317
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:45,174
Then we'll hit him harder.

318
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,244
- That means hitting cops.
- Dirty cops.

319
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,446
- Murderous thieves.
- Maybe.

320
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,781
But they're his own
private army.

321
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:53,616
He runs this town.

322
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:57,091
Even if we win,
we're gonna lose a lot.

323
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:04,997
They'll lose more.

324
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:08,135
<i>Patrona.</i>

325
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,803
This city has been
our private Eden, Marcel.

326
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:49,773
Mendoza is an invasive species.

327
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,311
She's putting down roots.

328
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:55,813
You wanna cut her out.

329
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:58,315
I need your answer.

330
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:00,654
Are you with me?

331
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:03,319
Of course.

332
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:05,255
You're the devil I know.

333
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:09,062
You know where she is?

334
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:11,527
Yeah.

335
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:14,664
She's holed up with her people
at a safe location.

336
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,500
Cedric and my crew...
they're sitting on her now.

337
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:20,504
- They'll help your boys out.
- No, Randall can handle it.

338
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,140
No.
I'm sorry, Judge.

339
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:25,843
I'm not taking any chances
this time.

340
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:28,545
My boys'll make sure
that nothing goes wrong

341
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:31,148
with the hit on Mendoza.

342
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:39,425
This war ends today.

343
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:50,672
I did the recon.
Teresa Mendoza's here.

344
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,011
How many men are with her?

345
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:03,348
Four.
The place is isolated.

346
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:05,084
Only one way in or out.

347
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,920
- So we got 'em boxed in...
- And outnumbered.

348
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:09,921
Like shooting fish
in a barrel, man.

349
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:14,029
Let's not start
stroking each other just yet.

350
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:17,933
Get your boys together.

351
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,543
Fall back!
Fall back!

352
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:25,134
Dumas set us up!

353
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:40,315
He's running away!

354
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:26,562
Hey, we get 'em all?

355
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:30,062
Almost.

356
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:32,364
What the hell, man?
Hm?

357
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,733
Why'd you do Birdie that way?

358
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:36,371
Birdie?

359
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:39,372
I was just
following orders, man.

360
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:40,806
Mm-hmm.

361
00:27:07,436 --> 00:27:09,235
I'm a soldier, same as you.

362
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:11,671
Kay?

363
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:13,873
She was a civilian.

364
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,274
I know.

365
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,909
It was messed up.

366
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:19,612
See, but you do this,
it all starts up again.

367
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:21,180
Okay?

368
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,922
It's Lafayette.

369
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,625
<i>So now you're a cop killer,</i>

370
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,096
<i>Ms. Mendoza.</i>

371
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:12,163
Those men weren't cops.

372
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:14,667
I learned early on
how dangerous it is

373
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:17,603
to underestimate you, hm?

374
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:20,171
<i>So I bought myself
a little insurance.</i>

375
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:21,574
<i>Do tell me.</i>

376
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,612
<i>Have you spoken to your
Russian friend lately?</i>

377
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:27,680
Say hello, darling.

378
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:31,053
Hello, Teresa.

379
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:34,023
<i>They grabbed me from my hotel.</i>

380
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,727
His cop shot two of my men.

381
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:43,696
Is the picture
becoming clear now?

382
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:45,797
Do you know who
she's connected to?

383
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,833
Oh, I have a pretty good idea.

384
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:51,170
They will hunt you down
and kill you.

385
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:53,171
<i>They don't care who you are.</i>

386
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:55,874
And you'll be right there
beside me, darling.

387
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,611
Mutually-assured destruction...

388
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:02,251
<i>unless you give me
my nephew's killer.</i>

389
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:05,720
<i>I expect an answer
by midnight.</i>

390
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:24,573
<i>Patrona.</i>

391
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,776
You know what you have to do.

392
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:30,880
<i>Está bien.</i>

393
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:34,249
It didn't have to be like this.

394
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,049
If you trusted me,
I could've protected you,

395
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:39,521
but now I can't.

396
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:14,222
Working with you, <i>patrona...</i>

397
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:25,634
I owe that to you.

398
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:28,470
<i>Salud.</i>

399
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:31,974
They're here.

400
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:35,577
Let them in.

401
00:30:43,985 --> 00:30:46,451
Everybody just breathe easy.

402
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:47,886
Hands where I can see 'em.

403
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:49,592
You're not here as the law.

404
00:30:50,926 --> 00:30:52,928
You know why I'm here,
Ms. Mendoza.

405
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:56,131
Let's put an end to all this.

406
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:08,276
I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

407
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,952
I was right, <i>patrona.</i>

408
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:26,258
We were crazy to think
we would have

409
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:28,296
something different
in this life.

410
00:31:48,883 --> 00:31:50,783
Let's go.

411
00:32:02,063 --> 00:32:03,498
Are you okay?

412
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,498
Yeah.

413
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:32,825
Oh, Davis,
you had me worried sick.

414
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:34,927
You tracked my phone?

415
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:37,062
I know you're angry,
but I forgive you.

416
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,364
You can come back home.

417
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,164
You forgive <i>me?</i>

418
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,267
You defied me, Davis,

419
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:44,670
but you showed fortitude
I didn't know you had.

420
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:47,273
- It gives me hope.
- Hope for what?

421
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,042
That you're more like me
than I thought.

422
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:52,611
- Go to hell.
- Judge.

423
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,582
We need to wrap this up.

424
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:57,883
You were tricked, son.

425
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,787
Mendoza's man,
the one you confided in...

426
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:05,190
he's the man
who murdered your cousin.

427
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:07,892
You're lying.
You'd say anything to me.

428
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:11,563
Mendoza handed him over
to me herself.

429
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,300
He's the reason
that sweet girl died.

430
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:17,568
But don't you worry.

431
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:20,241
He gonna get
what's coming to him.

432
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:03,349
Let's do this, <i>pendejo.</i>

433
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:06,351
What's he saying, Randall?

434
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:09,223
He's saying,
"Let's do this, <i>pendejo."</i>

435
00:34:10,492 --> 00:34:13,958
Gotta admire a man who welcomes
his own firing squad.

436
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:32,811
Nothing personal, <i>amigo.</i>

437
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:37,386
I actually kinda liked you.

438
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:46,691
Randall!

439
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:05,958
<i>The shoot-out
in Metairie took the lives</i>

440
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:08,581
<i>of six decorated officers,
including the head</i>

441
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:10,751
<i>of the anti-gang strike team,</i>

442
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:12,519
<i>Detective Randall Green.</i>

443
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,387
<i>Police at this time
are calling it</i>

444
00:35:14,423 --> 00:35:16,222
<i>a gang-related incident.</i>

445
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:17,391
Randall is dead.

446
00:35:17,427 --> 00:35:19,827
- Javier.
- Mm.

447
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:21,265
He fought to the end.

448
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:24,435
I'm sorry you were
pulled into this.

449
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,405
I know how much
this has cost you.

450
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:31,775
Do not think I am ungrateful.

451
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:54,831
The good news is that
you have his attention.

452
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:58,798
The bad news...

453
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,601
is that you have his attention.

454
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:03,340
So we are in business
with Kostya?

455
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:06,242
Yes.

456
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:09,613
For better or for worse.

457
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:11,981
Thank you.

458
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,590
The Judge is down,

459
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:25,325
but he's not out.

460
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:26,994
As long as he's breathing,

461
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,795
he's gonna be a problem for us.

462
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:31,632
If he loses his power,

463
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:33,733
he's just a man.

464
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,271
Any man can be killed.

465
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:47,118
Dave?

466
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:16,079
My son.

467
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:19,749
Son?
Son?

468
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:28,889
Oh, God.

469
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:31,028
What have I done?

470
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:58,885
Taza said there's
a new sheriff in Phoenix

471
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:00,153
that's cleaning up corruption,

472
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:02,056
so he's gonna need more money
for bribes.

473
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:03,523
- Send it.
- Okay.

474
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,492
- How's Miami?
- It's a little bumpy.

475
00:38:05,528 --> 00:38:07,427
Boaz had to dispose
of a few dealers

476
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:08,561
that were causing problems.

477
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:10,530
You were smart
to keep extra men there.

478
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:11,932
What about the new bankers?

479
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,367
I'm still checking references,

480
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:15,603
but I did make a list of new
businesses to clean our money,

481
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,103
and I'm looking into
making an investment

482
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:18,671
on the waterfront property

483
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:20,407
as well as some
commercial real estate.

484
00:38:20,443 --> 00:38:22,008
Great.

485
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:23,577
Thank you.

486
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:25,012
Happy to help.

487
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:28,249
I'm gonna get to that meeting,
but that suit is baller.

488
00:38:28,285 --> 00:38:30,083
Thank you.

489
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:39,229
It's okay, Luis.

490
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:52,642
I heard there was an explosion
in front of your bar.

491
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:55,979
You okay?

492
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:59,282
Yes.
Thank you.

493
00:39:01,785 --> 00:39:03,083
You know,

494
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,655
they said you were
in the hospital.

495
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:08,822
I was gonna come, but...

496
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:10,628
I wasn't sure you'd want me to.

497
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:14,164
I'm glad you didn't.

498
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:22,302
I spent the last month

499
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:25,838
putting all the pieces together
of what went down

500
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:28,342
between you and me.

501
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:30,244
I know you're not just a

502
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,050
bar owner or
a tequila distributor.

503
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:35,986
Tell me the truth.

504
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:41,992
I run a drug cartel.

505
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:45,628
Are you serious?

506
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:49,066
Every minute
you spend with me...

507
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,336
You're in danger.

508
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:56,340
I need you to go away.

509
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:01,077
Don't come back.

510
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:04,644
You lied to me.

511
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,916
Yes.

512
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:10,617
Everything else...

513
00:40:10,653 --> 00:40:12,523
was it a lie too?

514
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,992
No.

515
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:45,085
Phoenix, Atlanta, Miami.

516
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,820
Now, New York.

517
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:49,356
We doubled our operation
in three months.

518
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:51,023
That's a lot to keep an eye on.

519
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:52,760
Ain't no risk it, no biscuit.

520
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:54,994
You staying?

521
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,432
I'ma stick around.

522
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:59,233
Make sure you're good
with the Russkis.

523
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:01,835
Hey, you might need me.
I know Chewy does.

524
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:04,003
Whatever you need
to tell yourself, <i>cabrón.</i>

525
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:25,462
George, call a doctor.

526
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:29,862
My God, James.
What happened to you?

527
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:31,901
They're coming for you.

528
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:34,453
