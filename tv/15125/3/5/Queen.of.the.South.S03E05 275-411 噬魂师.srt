1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,830

THERESA: Previously on Queen of the South...

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,660

We're gonna sell on the dark web.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,630

- JAMES: Mail order cocaine? - TERESA: I have a guy.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,330

His name's Ivan. He's built me a site.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,870

We're gonna ship through a legitimate front

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,300

and get paid with cryptocurrency.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,040

We won't be cutting into anyone's territory.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,640

JAMES: No, but we still need to transport through it.

9
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,410

Arizona's carved up by five narcos.

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,210

They're called La Comisión.

11
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,840

There's a Mexican named Pecas. He's the leader.

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,180

You're very light on your feet, General.

13
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,680

Very impressed.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,060

You're the one with the gifts, mi jefa.

15
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,020

Just how much access do you think I have?

16
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,490

I'm still on suspension.

17
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,000

This is not a good idea.

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,400

Here's a little piece of Mexico to remember us by.

19
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,200

- Ah! - TERESA: We need your help.

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,830

As the business grows, you can grow with it.

21
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,540

POTE: We buying a winery?

22
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,600

KELLY ANNE: This place has an amazing wine cellar.

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,940

We can put our production down here.

24
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,170

And we've set up infrared cameras

25
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,710

all around the property.

26
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,880

And the entire system is linked to your phone.

27
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,710

- This is my wife Kelly Anne. - Hi.

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,580

POTE: Is the police looking for you?

29
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,680

Officially, I am a missing person.

30
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,290

And it's Priscilla now.

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,090

JAMES: I was working with Devon Finch.

32
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,690

Someone hijacked our shipment

33
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,220

and Devon wanted him taken out.

34
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,190

Why take a chance? Get it done.

35
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,570

JAMES: You always said there was a different way.

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400

I wanna do things differently.

37
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,240

Let me in.

38
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,870

KELLY ANNE: Welcome to Perla Blanca.

39
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,610

We are fully committed to offering our customers

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,250

the purest product.

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,450

Come on in. Have fun.

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,110

Keep eye-balling me. I know I'm pretty.

43
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,950

You know, she has a thing for strays.

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,420

Don't make her regret it.

45
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,760

Production's running smoothly, Teresita.

46
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,790

The shipments are out the door.

47
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,590

JAMES: Selling on the dark web,

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,430

cutting out the middle man, and turning product into champagne.

49
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,200

TERESA: Yeah? We did it.

50
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,230

No, you did it.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,340

Now that we have a team, we can expand.

52
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,870

Get big enough where no one can hurt us.

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,910

$30 million in a month is a good start.

54
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,780

You have your eyes on something?

55
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,450

A decent rib eye steak.

56
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,120

I haven't had one since we left Dallas.

57
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,730

How about you?

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,640

I took flying lessons when I was in Europe.

59
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,570

And if they come for me, I'll be ready.

60
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,110

And if they come for you, I'll be ready.

61
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,120

You still don't trust me?

62
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,750

You're still here.

63
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,650

That's something.

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,420

MAN: Yeah, right, it was like that, right?

65
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,890

He's making it worse than what I...

66
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,260

It was not that bad at all.

67
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,330

Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,270

Good evening.

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,910

I'd like to arrange dinner reservations for my boss.

70
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,440

We would love to accommodate you, but we're closin'.

71
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,140

Hmm.

72
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,120

MAN: Hands up. Hands in the air.

73
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,750

Don't move. Don't move.

74
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,420

Gun on the floor, or your brains on the wall.

75
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,760

Calm down.

76
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,860

Do not reach for that panic button.

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,500

We good, Vee?

78
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,700

We real good, E.

79
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,700

Call your boss. Now.

80
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,040

Hey.

81
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,110

DEVON : Hello, Miss Mendoza.

82
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,880

I hear the Sangiovese does well in this dry climate.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,320

Devon.

84
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,850

DEVON: I've just arrived in Phoenix.

85
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,550

I have your manager and I have your coke.

86
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,290

TERESA : She's not part of my business.

87
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,520

Whatever the problem is, we can fix it.

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,190

DEVON: Join me for dinner at your winery.

89
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,830

This invitation is not optional.

90
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,500

First course begins at eight. Be here. Come alone.

91
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,180

Subtitles by explosiveskull

92
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,780

ANCHOR:

93
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,730

Boaz has fled to Badiraguato.

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,560

His cousin Javier Jimenez is helping him.

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600

A wounded animal always runs back home.

96
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,630

CORTEZ: He's desperate.

97
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,970

He sent a message to his people.

98
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,340

He's begging for a truce,

99
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,470

for the sake of his son and your daughter's union.

100
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,610

Boaz tried to kill me. There is no truce.

101
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,180

Perhaps we can use Kique to track him down.

102
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,080

I cannot involve my future son-in-law in this.

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,150

That would destroy Isabela.

104
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,150

We must find another way.

105
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,020

You did good, General.

106
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,990

We're nearly free of Boaz.

107
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,260

But there is still the matter of Teresa Mendoza.

108
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,670

Has Agent Loya provided you with any further assistance?

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,540

He can only do so much until the DEA reinstates him.

110
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,270

According to my sources, he has been reinstated.

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,010

Recently?

112
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,550

CORTEZ: Weeks ago. And there's more.

113
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,520

They say the DEA's target is no longer Boaz.

114
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,120

It's you.

115
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,890

And you trust your sources?

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,820

I trust no one.

117
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,790

But, given your history with Agent Loya,

118
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,700

I suggest we err on the side of caution.

119
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,400

Nobody touches Loya.

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,570

Not until I look at him in the eye and speak to him myself.

121
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,310

Is that clear?

122
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,840

Como guste, Gobernadora.

123
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,390

JAMES: There's no service in the cellar,

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,690

but I'm sure Pote's safe.

125
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,700

Someone was watching us.

126
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,530

Or someone set us up.

127
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,170

LIL T: Any word from Pote and the guys?

128
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,080

Not yet. Listen we're gonna need your help.

129
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,950

Hey, when was the last time you spoke to your uncle?

130
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,750

We don't speak anymore. What's your point?

131
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,750

It's just a little convenient.

132
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,390

Pote kills your gangbanger buddies,

133
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,520

you come work for us, and now Devon finds us.

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920

You think I led him here?

135
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,520

You know, maybe it was your payback.

136
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,360

Teresa got shot when your ass switched out the coke.

137
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,030

Don't talk to me about loyalty.

138
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,960

I lost my family over this shit.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,530

I brought her here because I trust her.

140
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,230

Whatever you need me to do I'll do,

141
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,970

but if this pendejo keeps stepping to me...

142
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,040

He won't. Be ready to move, okay?

143
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,770

We're on our way to the winery.

144
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,210

Shit, born ready.

145
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080

I'll call you. Let's go.

146
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,960

Most domestic sparkling wine is unremarkable.

147
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,890

You knew enough to find Teresa a winery

148
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,660

that produces a supple and elegant vintage.

149
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,230

I salute you, Priscilla.

150
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,300

Listen, I'm just the manager here, okay?

151
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,670

I promise I don't know anything.

152
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,100

You ran a wine club in Dallas?

153
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,740

My former attorney, Cole Van Awken,

154
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,240

told me about your fine palate.

155
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,410

It's a shame what happened to him,

156
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,240

isn't it, Kelly Anne?

157
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,420

Take her downstairs. Her time will come.

158
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,350

All right, Hannah Montana, let's go.

159
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,350

Okay.

160
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,030

TERESA: They're moving Kelly Anne.

161
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,870

If Devon wanted our coke,

162
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,310

he'd already be gone.

163
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,710

Why is he here?

164
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,440

Because he wants me.

165
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,440

For not taking out that guy in Texas for him.

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,510

I'm gonna go in there and work it out with him.

167
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,850

You hurt his business. There's no working that out.

168
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,820

- I'm gonna go in. - What're you doing?

169
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,690

I'm not gonna let you walk in there alone.

170
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,290

Listen to me. Go to La Comisión for backup.

171
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,530

Have Ivan get something on Devon

172
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,230

that we can use against him.

173
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,630

Yeah, but he could hurt you before that happens.

174
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,070

He wants something else. It's safer this way.

175
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,070

Go to La Comisión. I'll be okay.

176
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,850

- KELLY ANNE: Ow . - VEE: Shut up.

177
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,350

VEE: Sit down.

178
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760

Tie her ass up.

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,070

- Keep that bitch quiet. - Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,410

Just me, gabacha.

181
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,880

Oh, thank God, I thought they killed you.

182
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,250

I was in here when they hit us.

183
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,580

I'm gonna get us out of here.

184
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,450

But I need your help.

185
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,460

Miss Mendoza.

186
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,100

DEVON: Perfect timing.

187
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,100

Dinner is served.

188
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,390

Where are my people?

189
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,180

DEVON: Your security is being held by mine,

190
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,790

so that we may dine in peace.

191
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,630

- And my manager? - You mean Kelly Anne?

192
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,030

She hasn't been harmed. Yet.

193
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,530

What do you want from me?

194
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,030

Direct as always.

195
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,540

I want an introduction to El Santo.

196
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,440

I have no way to contact him directly.

197
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,140

Even if I could,

198
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,540

he only deals with his followers.

199
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,240

You weren't always one of his followers.

200
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,380

Yet you found your way into his flock.

201
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,980

I don't doubt your powers of persuasion, Miss Mendoza.

202
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,820

I can deliver you product, but not him.

203
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,060

We can make that deal.

204
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,960

But you coming here like this, it's not the man you are.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,730

Evelyn.

206
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,330

PROFESSOR:

207
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,430

DEVON:

208
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,970

She thinks she knows me.

209
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,740

DEVON: Let me tell you three things.

210
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,940

Those days between you and me are over.

211
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,280

You have no clue who I am.

212
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,180

Tonight you're gonna find out.

213
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,350

POTE: I'm gonna take him out.

214
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,920

Then we run for the tunnel.

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,190

Okay, but there's a whole bunch

216
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,460

more guards all over the winery.

217
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500

They got guns, and, like, radios.

218
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,470

- Now you have one. - I don't...

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,000

POTE: When they come for us, you let 'em have it.

220
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,640

I don't think that's a good idea.

221
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,340

I cleaned up your husband.

222
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,940

I know you can shoot.

223
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,640

That was different.

224
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,880

You were in danger then, you're in danger now.

225
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,680

We're like sitting ducks in here.

226
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,390

I need your help.

227
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,020

Are you with me?

228
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,820

Or not?

229
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,700

Andale, gabach.

230
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,570

Okay.

231
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,710

JAMES: I thought I was meeting with the full Comisión.

232
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,070

PECAS: We don't throw up the Bat-Signal

233
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,380

every time you get yourself into trouble.

234
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,680

They authorized me to hear you out on their behalf.

235
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,180

So...

236
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,020

What did you do to bring Devon Finch down here?

237
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,760

We're not clear on that just yet.

238
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,930

Then I'm not sure I can help you.

239
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,590

What's the point of having a Comisión

240
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,560

if an outsider can come in and do what he wants?

241
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,430

Since you arrived, all we've seen is chaos.

242
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,830

You think the other members are eager to go to war

243
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,500

with a Chicago gangster on your behalf?

244
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,200

We backed off the Sheriff on your behalf.

245
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,840

You're making money from us. Now you just wanna screw us?

246
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,410

It's not my call.

247
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,550

I... I'll talk to the rest of La Comisión.

248
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,680

But in the meantime,

249
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,780

see if you can't work this out yourselves first.

250
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,020

I'll remember this.

251
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,030

PECAS: Okay.

252
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,030

I'll remember this.

253
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,710

DEVON: Give me the phone.

254
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,280

Don't make me ask twice.

255
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,320

Hey, my old friend.

256
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,120

I'm here with Teresa.

257
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,120

DEVON : We just started our second course.

258
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,820

Look, whatever this is, whatever game you're playing...

259
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,560

Did you really think you weren't gonna see me again?

260
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,260

That's got nothing to do with Teresa.

261
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,500

It does now. So why don't you come in here,

262
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,170

meet me face to face?

263
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,140

JAMES : Just know, if you hurt her...

264
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,440

You came here for revenge.

265
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,910

From James, yes.

266
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,450

From you, I told you what I want.

267
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,080

If you hurt me,

268
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,290

you won't need to look for El Santo.

269
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920

He'll find you.

270
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,290

One last chance, Miss Mendoza.

271
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,330

I want a line to your supplier.

272
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,830

Bring me her friend.

273
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,530

Wait.

274
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,140

He gave me a number for emergencies only.

275
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,170

I have it memorized.

276
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,010

You and the numbers.

277
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,170

Everything okay?

278
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,080

What's on your mind?

279
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,190

I understood the rules when we started this.

280
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,320

We had common goals

281
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,360

and the exchange of information helped us both.

282
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,900

The rest of it

283
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,330

was

284
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,170

unexpected.

285
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,940

Lovely.

286
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,140

It has been.

287
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,720

I know the DEA reinstated you.

288
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,720

And I know their goal is no longer Boaz, but me.

289
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,930

You think I lied to you?

290
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,140

I don't wanna believe that.

291
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,140

I don't know who's been telling you these things.

292
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,480

But I'd ask you what they have to gain.

293
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,480

I saved your life when I didn't know you.

294
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,750

You think I'd set you up now that I do?

295
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,250

We've been at war, Camila.

296
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,290

But in this thing here,

297
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,590

I'm with you.

298
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160

Say it again.

299
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,770

I'm with you.

300
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,660

TERESA: Are you Haitian?

301
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,290

Excuse me?

302
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,130

You sound like you're Haitian.

303
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,500

PROFESSOR: Ah.

304
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,000

If I were you, I'd mind my own damn business.

305
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,380

Are you seeing this?

306
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,750

JAMES: She's telling us something.

307
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,320

That woman.

308
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,490

- Do a search on her. - On it.

309
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,150

JAMES : Whatever you get, send it to Lil T,

310
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,220

ASAP.

311
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,520

Done.

312
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,330

That number you gave us

313
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,530

tracks to a pay phone on the coast of Ecuador.

314
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,900

El Santo has followers everywhere.

315
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,100

- It must be a drop phone. - DEVON: That's bullshit.

316
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,240

And you're just buying time.

317
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,740

Bring me her friend.

318
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,580

KELLY ANNE: Ah!

319
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,350

MAN: You need to be quiet.

320
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,350

- POTE: Let's go. - Okay.

321
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,090

You have the keys to the tunnel?

322
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,200

The guards took 'em.

323
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,560

Stay there. Cover me.

324
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,570

Okay.

325
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,220

MAN: Oh!

326
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,790

VEE: Get your ass out here.

327
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,830

KELLY ANNE: Don't shoot.

328
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,300

I don't ha... I don't have a gun.

329
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,430

Get down on your knees now.

330
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,440

Okay.

331
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,030

DEVON: I'm gonna ask you once, nicely.

332
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,040

How does Teresa get in contact with El Santo?

333
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,640

I don't know.

334
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,610

She doesn't. Let her go.

335
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,140

I have a better idea.

336
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,980

Let's go swimming.

337
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,150

What?

338
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,990

What does he mean "swimming"?

339
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,850

- Put her on the board. - What does he...

340
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,660

No, no, no, no.

341
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,230

- What... - TERESA: No.

342
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,860

DEVON: Give me El Santo and I'll let her go.

343
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,080

I got out through the tunnel. But they got Kelly Anne.

344
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880

- We gotta go back in. - No, we're outnumbered.

345
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,350

We rush in now, they kill Teresa and Kelly Anne.

346
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,660

- Where's Tonto and Charger? - I don't know.

347
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,660

But we gotta do something.

348
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,230

What're you... what're you doing?

349
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,770

Teresa!

350
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,730

TERESA: She doesn't know anything.

351
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,570

Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

352
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,740

KELLY ANNE:

353
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,410

TERESA: Listen to me, don't do this.

354
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,010

Stop it, you're gonna kill her.

355
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,680

Just let her go.

356
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,050

I'll give you anything you want.

357
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,850

Come on.

358
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,190

KELLY ANNE:

359
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,520

CORTEZ:

360
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,930

Come here.

361
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,450

There's a camera in the motion detector.

362
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,250

LOYA: I know what you're doing.

363
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,160

And I know who's behind it.

364
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,170

Last year Cortez tried to kill you.

365
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,110

And I saved your life.

366
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,180

So who are you gonna believe?

367
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,130

Take the side door.

368
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,030

LOYA: Get out of here.

369
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,480

CORTEZ:

370
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,190

- DEVON: Then we have a deal. - JAMES: I'm good with that.

371
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,060

Let me tell her.

372
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,730

Devon's leaving.

373
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,860

He's let Kelly Anne go, and you can go too.

374
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,060

And he's gonna back off your business.

375
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,030

What does he get in return?

376
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,700

He's leaving with me so we can settle our unfinished business.

377
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,400

No.

378
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,270

DEVON: Last year, this man showed loyalty to Camila

379
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,810

and nearly got you killed.

380
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,810

You're willing to sacrifice everything,

381
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,110

including your life, for this man?

382
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,550

Yes.

383
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,550

Has he told you about

384
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,390

his little excursion with us in Texas?

385
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,660

He spared the man you wanted to kill.

386
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,430

Oh, she doesn't know.

387
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,660

Well, allow me to open your eyes.

388
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,400

Or better yet, let's have the man

389
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,670

that you're willing to trade your life for do it for you.

390
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,410

Devon sent me to take out a man who had

391
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,650

hijacked one of his shipments.

392
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,450

You told me.

393
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,630

Mark? No.

394
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,780

SUZIE: Mommy, what was that? What's happening?

395
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,540

We caught someone trying to break in.

396
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,110

I need you to go next door to the neighbors.

397
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,950

Go, go, go.

398
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,400

SUZIE: Mommy, mommy.

399
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,870

No!

400
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,500

DEVON: The man he took out

401
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,170

was part of a crew that stole a shipment from me.

402
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,210

James was supposed to take those men out,

403
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,970

make it look like a robbery.

404
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,410

Instead, he turned the first one into a bloodbath,

405
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,380

where a little girl died.

406
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,910

Then grew a conscience and decided to walk away

407
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,350

from the rest of the job.

408
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,990

I'm taking this piece of shit.

409
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,820

What you must decide, Miss Mendoza,

410
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,520

now that you know everything about him,

411
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,930

is are you willing to sacrifice your life

412
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,930

in a futile attempt to prevent that?

413
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,430

Take him.

414
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,210

Mano a mano.

415
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,610

I'm gonna like this.

416
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,710

Just like you like watching me and Camila?

417
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,470

Camila and I will rule Mexico.

418
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,310

And there's no room for a little boy.

419
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,760

Better her boy than her dog.

420
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,290

Eh, cabrón.

421
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,300

Listen.

422
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,810

I'm not gonna let him take you.

423
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,970

But you just said...

424
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,440

I said that to buy us time.

425
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,980

VEE: There's someone on the outer grounds.

426
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,810

Armed. Coming this way.

427
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,650

Check it out. Collect the men.

428
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,820

- Okay. - Get the car ready.

429
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,090

The cabinet behind me.

430
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,560

With the guns? There's too many of them.

431
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,490

- JAMES: We won't make it. - Then we don't make it.

432
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,360

What you wanna do, son?

433
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,330

VEE: Put the gun down before it gets ugly.

434
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,310

Stop.

435
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,350

You're gonna wanna see this.

436
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,520

How did you find her?

437
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,030

How the hell did you find my mother?

438
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,230

You're invisible online.

439
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,860

But your sister's not.

440
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,600

I should kill you.

441
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,670

You saw your mother.

442
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,340

Phone, please.

443
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,740

ALL:

444
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,950

- Any problems? - LIL T : No.

445
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,580

Who knew that delivery truck could go 150

446
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,950

on the highway, though.

447
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,020

LIL T: That hacker dude's the shit.

448
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,920

So what you gonna need me to do?

449
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,260

Wait for me to call you back in a few.

450
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,030

Devon's just leaving.

451
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,060

I have news.

452
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,670

Not sure if it's good or bad, but...

453
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700

He got away.

454
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,740

I do not recall authorizing an audience.

455
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,110

You let him escape.

456
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,210

You failed me, General.

457
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,880

CORTEZ: The cameras were for your protection.

458
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,690

I apologize.

459
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,090

Hearing you speak to him the way you did in that hotel, I...

460
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,260

I don't have to explain myself to you.

461
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,460

It was all information and sex.

462
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,570

That's all it was with him.

463
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,900

Lately,

464
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,440

nothing seems to make me happy.

465
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,910

Well, I think I have something that may change that for you.

466
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,380

In an unexpected offer from a friend.

467
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,220

Something I think you'll like very much.

468
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,930

LIN: We ran the phone number Mendoza supplied again.

469
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,430

Problem's that El Santo's people change them

470
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,600

so frequently that this is one burnt now.

471
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,340

So she really did give up her supplier for that bastard.

472
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,310

Loyalty to a fault.

473
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,510

Can't be bought either.

474
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,010

Told the brass I saw firsthand

475
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,110

you'd gone above and beyond to get us that intel.

476
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,410

She found leverage on the fly

477
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,450

and backed me off without a gun.

478
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,650

- I underestimated her. - We all did, Devante.

479
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,020

We'll tighten things up on our end.

480
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,090

Relocate your mother, and our cyber team

481
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,660

will make sure your sister and family

482
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,930

have no further internet presence.

483
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,200

Where do they want me?

484
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,800

Chief of Station wants you back

485
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,700

at your aviation business in Chicago.

486
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,840

El Santo remains a priority target for the agency.

487
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,370

We'll find another way at 'em.

488
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,710

I might already have one.

489
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,520

This might hurt.

490
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,550

KELLY ANNE:

491
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,720

Yeah.

492
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,700

You're good?

493
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,500

Yeah.

494
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,400

TERESA: Listen.

495
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,670

If you want to leave, I'll help set you up

496
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,140

anywhere you want to go, okay?

497
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,180

I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you.

498
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,850

I'm not going anywhere.

499
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620

Okay.

500
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,490

POTE: Andale, gabacha.

501
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,530

I'll check on dinner.

502
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,900

KELLY ANNE: I fired that gun like it was nothing.

503
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,430

I hit that guard.

504
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,770

I wasn't even thinking twice if I killed him.

505
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,080

Shooting Cole, I knew who I was and what I was doing.

506
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,080

And it killed me.

507
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,350

But I'm scared because today I don't feel a thing.

508
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,690

Your husband beat you.

509
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,760

The men you shot at

510
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,960

wanted to kill us.

511
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,630

It is all right to feel nothing for hurting the people

512
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,030

that want to destroy you.

513
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,140

You saved my life.

514
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,640

You're family now.

515
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,410

Thank you.

516
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,060

Let's eat.

517
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,460

Okay.

518
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,730

Oh, my God, that smells amazing.

519
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,560

Pollo la crem.

520
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,630

The chicken's gonna taste like it was born in the sauce.

521
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,140

KELLY ANNE:

522
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,840

Come on, prueba.

523
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,810

- Oh, my gosh. -

524
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,110

-  - Hand me your plate.

525
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,960

House is yours now. I'm gonna leave.

526
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,660

No.

527
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,130

Look, I'm no good for you here. I mean, you could've lost

528
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,970

everything, including your life.

529
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,870

And I lied to you, right to your face.

530
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,050

Yes. And I know why you did.

531
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,380

Her name was Suzie.

532
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,450

She couldn't have been more than, like, six years old.

533
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:09,390

I can't stop thinking about her.

534
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,160

You didn't mean for that to happen.

535
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,240

You once told me there's no good or bad in this business.

536
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,340

Right?

537
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,410

I'm not sure I believe that anymore.

538
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,080

Because of that little girl?

539
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,350

Her.

540
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,020

And you.

541
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,430

Listen.

542
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,530

Whatever you've done,

543
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,030

you don't need to hide from me.

544
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,670

We're in this together.

545
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,350

I don't deserve that.

546
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,420

Everyone deserves that.

547
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,740

MAN: Andale, pues.

548
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,510

Let's go. Let's get on with it.
