1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,846
Previously on
Queen of the South...

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,672
We're gonna sell
on the dark web.

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,641
- Mail order cocaine?
- I have a guy.

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,343
His name's Ivan.
He's built me a site.

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,887
We're gonna ship
through a legitimate front

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,313
and get paid with
cryptocurrency.

7
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,058
We won't be cutting
into anyone's territory.

8
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,659
No, but we still need
to transport through it.

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,418
Arizona's carved up
by five narcos.

10
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,220
They're called La Comisión.

11
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,093
There's a Mexican named Pecas.
He's the leader.

12
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,194
You're very light
on your feet, General.

13
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,695
Very impressed.

14
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,064
You're the one with the gifts,
mi jefa.

15
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,032
Just how much access
do you think I have?

16
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,502
I'm still on suspension.

17
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,004
This is not a good idea.

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,407
Here's a little piece
of Mexico to remember us by.

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,209
We need your help.

20
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,852
As the business grows,
you can grow with it.

21
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,545
We buying a winery?

22
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,614
This place has
an amazing wine cellar.

23
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,957
We can put our production
down here.

24
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,193
And we've set up
infrared cameras

25
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,718
all around the property.

26
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,886
And the entire system
is linked to your phone.

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,723
- This is my wife Kelly Anne.
- Hi.

28
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,591
Is the police
looking for you?

29
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,693
Officially,
I am a missing person.

30
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,295
And it's Priscilla now.

31
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,097
I was working
with Devon Finch.

32
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,698
Someone hijacked
our shipment

33
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,234
and Devon wanted him
taken out.

34
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,202
Why take a chance?
Get it done.

35
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,584
You always said
there was a different way.

36
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,410
I wanna do things differently.

37
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:19,247
Let me in.

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,982
(Lil' Kim's
"Queen Bitch" playing)

39
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,884
Welcome to Perla Blanca.

40
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,620
We are fully committed
to offering our customers

41

42
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,458
Come on in.
Have fun.

Selling
on the dark web,

77
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,437
cutting out the middle man, and
turning product into champagne.

78
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,206
Yeah?
We did it.

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,242
No, you did it.

80
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,348
Now that we have a team,
we can expand.

81
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:37,885
Get big enough
where no one can hurt us.

82
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,922
$30 million in a month
is a good start.

83
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,791
You have your eyes
on something?

84
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,463
A decent rib eye steak.

85
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,133
I haven't had one
since we left Dallas.

86
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,735
How about you?

87
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,645
I took flying lessons
when I was in Europe.

88
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,581
And if they come for me,
I'll be ready.

89
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,117
And if they come for you,
I'll be ready.

90
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:18,125
You still don't trust me?

91
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,760
You're still here.

92
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,662
That's something.

93
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,433
Yeah, right,
it was like that, right?

94
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,903
He's making it worse
than what I...

95
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,271
It was not that bad at all.

96
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,340
Yeah.

97
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,279
Good evening.

98
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,915
I'd like to arrange dinner
reservations for my boss.

99
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,453
We would love to accommodate
you, but we're closin'.

100
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,124
Hands up.
Hands in the air.

101
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,760
Don't move.
Don't move.

102
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,430
Gun on the floor,
or your brains on the wall.

103
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,766
Calm down.

104
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,869
Do not reach
for that panic button.

105
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,505
We good, Vee?

106
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,707
We real good, E.

107
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,711
Call your boss.
Now.

108
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,051
Hey.

109
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,120
Hello, Miss Mendoza.

110
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,892
I hear the Sangiovese does
well in this dry climate.

111
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,326
Devon.

112
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,861
I've just
arrived in Phoenix.

113
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,563
I have your manager
and I have your coke.

114
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,307
She's not part of my business.

115
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,535
Whatever the problem is,
we can fix it.

116
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,203
Join me for dinner
at your winery.

117
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,838
This invitation
is not optional.

118
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,509
First course begins at eight.
Be here. Come alone.

119
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,335
Boaz has fled to Badiraguato.

120
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,171
His cousin
Javier Jimenez is helping him.

121
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,207
A wounded animal
always runs back home.

122
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,243
He's desperate.

123
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:19,580
He sent a message
to his people.

124
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,949
He's begging for a truce,

125
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,084
for the sake of his son
and your daughter's union.

126
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,220
Boaz tried to kill me.
There is no truce.

127
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,790
Perhaps we can use Kique
to track him down.

128
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,693
I cannot involve my future
son-in-law in this.

129
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,762
That would destroy Isabela.

130
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,764
We must find another way.

131
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,632
You did good, General.

132
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,601
We're nearly free of Boaz.

133
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,872
But there is still
the matter of Teresa Mendoza.

134
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,275
Has Agent Loya provided you
with any further assistance?

135
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,145
He can only do so much until
the DEA reinstates him.

136
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,883
According to my sources,
he has been reinstated.

137
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,620
Recently?

138
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,155
Weeks ago.
And there's more.

139
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,125
They say the DEA's target
is no longer Boaz.

140
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,728
It's you.

141
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,497
And you trust your sources?

142
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,431
I trust no one.

143
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:15,402
But, given your history
with Agent Loya,

144
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,306
I suggest we err
on the side of caution.

145
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,011
Nobody touches Loya.

146
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:28,181
Not until I look at him in the
eye and speak to him myself.

147
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,917
Is that clear?

148
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,454
Como guste, Gobernadora.

149
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,001
There's no service
in the cellar,

150
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,302
but I'm sure Pote's safe.

151
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,305
Someone was watching us.

152
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,143
Or someone set us up.

153
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,784
Any word from Pote
and the guys?

154
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,686
Not yet. Listen we're gonna
need your help.

155
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,556
Hey, when was the last time
you spoke to your uncle?

156
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,357
We don't speak anymore.
What's your point?

157
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,359
It's just a little convenient.

158
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,994
Pote kills your
gangbanger buddies,

159
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,129
you come work for us,
and now Devon finds us.

160
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,531
You think I led him here?

161
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,132
You know,
maybe it was your payback.

162
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,977
Teresa got shot when your ass
switched out the coke.

163
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,636
Don't talk
to me about loyalty.

164
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,573
I lost my family
over this shit.

165
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,141
I brought her here
because I trust her.

166
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,843
Whatever you need me
to do I'll do,

167
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,579
but if this pendejo
keeps stepping to me...

168
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,648
He won't.
Be ready to move, okay?

169
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,383
We're on our way to the winery.

170
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,818
Shit, born ready.

171
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,689
I'll call you.
Let's go.

172
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:52,566
Most domestic sparkling wine
is unremarkable.

173
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,501
You knew enough
to find Teresa a winery

174
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,270
that produces a supple
and elegant vintage.

175
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,840
I salute you, Priscilla.

176
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,909
Listen, I'm just
the manager here, okay?

177
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,277
I promise
I don't know anything.

178
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,713
You ran a wine club in Dallas?

179
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,348
My former attorney,
Cole Van Awken,

180
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,850
told me about your fine palate.

181
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,019
It's a shame
what happened to him,

182
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,854
isn't it, Kelly Anne?

183
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,026
Take her downstairs.
Her time will come.

184
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,961
All right, Hannah Montana,
let's go.

185
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,964
Okay.

186
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,644
They're moving
Kelly Anne.

187
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,479
If Devon wanted our coke,

188
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,914
he'd already be gone.

189
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,315
Why is he here?

190
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,051
Because he wants me.

191
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,054
For not taking out
that guy in Texas for him.

192
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,122
I'm gonna go in there
and work it out with him.

193
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,459
You hurt his business.
There's no working that out.

194
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,441
- I'm gonna go in.
- What're you doing?

195
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm not gonna let you
walk in there alone.

196
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,911
Listen to me.
Go to La Comisión for backup.

197
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,146
Have Ivan get something
on Devon

198
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,838
that we can use
against him.

199
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:08,241
Yeah, but he could hurt you
before that happens.

200
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,678
He wants something else.
It's safer this way.

201
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,682
Go to La Comisión.
I'll be okay.

202
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,454
Shut up.

203
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,961
Sit down.

204
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,365
Tie her ass up.

205
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,679
Keep that bitch quiet.

206
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,020
Just me, gabacha.

207
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,497
Thank God,
I thought they killed you.

208
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,857
I was in here when they hit us.

209
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,192
I'm gonna get us out of here.

210
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,061
But I need your help.

211
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,069
Miss Mendoza.

212
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,707
Perfect timing.

213
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,710
Dinner is served.

214
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,020
Where are my people?

215
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,732
Your security
is being held by mine,

216
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,424
so that we may dine in peace.

217
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,194
- And my manager?
- You mean Kelly Anne?

218
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,664
She hasn't been harmed. Yet.

219
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,166
What do you want from me?

220
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,667
Direct as always.

221
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,170
I want an introduction
to El Santo.

222
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,074
I have no way
to contact him directly.

223
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,776
Even if I could,

224
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,178
he only deals
with his followers.

225
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,880
You weren't always
one of his followers.

226
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,016
Yet you found your way
into his flock.

227
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,618
I don't doubt your powers of
persuasion, Miss Mendoza.

228
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,455
I can deliver you product,
but not him.

229
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,691
We can make that deal.

230
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,595
But you coming here like this,
it's not the man you are.

231
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,364
Evelyn.

232
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,602
She thinks she knows me.

233
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,376
Let me tell you
three things.

234
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,579
Those days between
you and me are over.

235
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,917
You have no clue who I am.

236
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,820
Tonight you're gonna find out.

237
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,989
I'm gonna take him out.

238
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,557
Then we run for the tunnel.

239
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,826
Okay,
but there's a whole bunch

240
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,099
more guards
all over the winery.

241
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,130
They got guns,
and, like, radios.

242
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,101
- Now you have one.
- I don't...

243
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,637
When they come for us,
you let 'em have it.

244
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,272
I don't think
that's a good idea.

245
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,974
I cleaned up
your husband.

246
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,575
I know you can shoot.

247
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,277
That was different.

248
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,512
You were in danger then,
you're in danger now.

249
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,315
We're like sitting ducks
in here.

250
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,021
I need your help.

251
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,656
Are you with me?

252
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,459
Or not?

253
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,331
Andale, gabacha.

254
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,201
Okay.

255
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,340
I thought I was meeting
with the full Comisión.

256
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,709
We don't throw up
the Bat-Signal

257
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,013
every time you get
yourself into trouble.

258
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:37,317
They authorized me to hear
you out on their behalf.

259
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,818
So...

260
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,654
What did you do
to bring Devon Finch down here?

261
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,390
We're not clear
on that just yet.

262
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,559
Then I'm not sure
I can help you.

263
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,228
What's the point
of having a Comisión

264
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,197
if an outsider can come in
and do what he wants?

265
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,066
Since you arrived,
all we've seen is chaos.

266
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,468
You think the other members
are eager to go to war

267
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,137
with a Chicago gangster
on your behalf?

268
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,839
We backed off the Sheriff
on your behalf.

269
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:03,476
You're making money from us.
Now you just wanna screw us?

270
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,045
It's not my call.

271
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,180
I... I'll talk to the rest
of La Comisión.

272
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,316
But in the meantime,

273
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,419
see if you can't work
this out yourselves first.

274
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,656
I'll remember this.

275
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,659
Okay.

276
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,662
I'll remember this.

277
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,342
Give me the phone.

278
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,910
Don't make me ask twice.

279
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,954
Hey, my old friend.

280
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,755
I'm here with Teresa.

281
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,766
We just
started our second course.

282
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,460
Look, whatever this is,
whatever game you're playing...

283
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,204
Did you really think you
weren't gonna see me again?

284
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,896
That's got nothing
to do with Teresa.

285
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,132
It does now.
So why don't you come in here,

286
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,800
meet me face to face?

287
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,769
Just know, if you hurt her...

288
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,076
You came here for revenge.

289
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,544
From James, yes.

290
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,082
From you,
I told you what I want.

291
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,717
If you hurt me,

292
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,920
you won't need
to look for El Santo.

293
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,555
He'll find you.

294
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,924
One last chance,
Miss Mendoza.

295
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,961
I want a line to your supplier.

296
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,464
Bring me her friend.

297
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,167
Wait.

298
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,769
He gave me a number
for emergencies only.

299
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,805
I have it memorized.

300
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,642
You and the numbers.

301
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,801
Everything okay?

302
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,711
What's on your mind?

303
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,816
I understood the rules
when we started this.

304
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,955
We had common goals

305
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,991
and the exchange of information
helped us both.

306
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,532
The rest of it

307
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,968
was

308
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,804
unexpected.

309
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,574
Lovely.

310
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,776
It has been.

311
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,349
I know the DEA reinstated you.

312
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,354
And I know their goal
is no longer Boaz, but me.

313
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,562
You think I lied to you?

314
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,767
I don't wanna believe that.

315
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,772
I don't know who's been
telling you these things.

316
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:23,110
But I'd ask you
what they have to gain.

317
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,112
I saved your life
when I didn't know you.

318
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,380
You think I'd set you up
now that I do?

319
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,882
We've been at war, Camila.

320
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,919
But in this thing here,

321
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,224
I'm with you.

322
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,793
Say it again.

323
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm with you.

324
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,292
Are you Haitian?

325
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,926
Excuse me?

326
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,761
You sound like you're Haitian.

327
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,636
If I were you,
I'd mind my own damn business.

328
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,014
Are you seeing this?

329
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,382
She's telling us
something.

330
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,950
That woman.

331
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,119
- Do a search on her.
- On it.

332
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,797
Whatever
you get, send it to Lil T,

333
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,855
ASAP.

334
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,157
Done.

335
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,961
That number you gave us

336
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,163
tracks to a pay phone
on the coast of Ecuador.

337
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,533
El Santo has
followers everywhere.

338
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,735
- It must be a drop phone.
- That's bullshit.

339
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,870
And you're just buying time.

340
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,374
Bring me her friend.

341
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,986
You need to be quiet.

342
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,989
- Let's go.
- Okay.

343
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,728
You have the keys
to the tunnel?

344
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,830
The guards took 'em.

345
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,198
Stay there.
Cover me.

346
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,201
Okay.

347
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,428
Get your ass out here.

348
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,463
Don't shoot.

349
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,931
I don't I don't have a gun.

350
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,067
Get down on your knees now.

351
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,070
Okay.

352
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,668
I'm gonna ask you
once, nicely.

353
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,671
How does Teresa get
in contact with El Santo?

354
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,273
I don't know.

355
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:17,243
She doesn't.
Let her go.

356
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,779
I have a better idea.

357
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,614
Let's go swimming.

358
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:24,784
What?

359
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,621
What does he mean "swimming"?

360
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,490
- Put her on the board.
- What does he...

361
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,292
No, no, no, no.

362
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,861
- What...
- No.

363
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:38,498
Give me El Santo
and I'll let her go.

364
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:57,717
I got out through the tunnel.
But they got Kelly Anne.

365
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,528
- We gotta go back in.
- No, we're outnumbered.

366
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,988
We rush in now, they kill
Teresa and Kelly Anne.

367
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,290
- Where's Tonto and Charger?
- I don't know.

368
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,293
But we gotta do something.

369
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,864
What're you...
what're you doing?

370
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,400
Teresa!

371
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,368
She doesn't know anything.

372
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:19,205
Wait, wait, no, no, no...

373
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:25,044
Listen to me,
don't do this.

374
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,647
Stop it, you're gonna kill her.

375
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,315
Just let her go.

376
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,684
I'll give you
anything you want.

377
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,489
Come on.

378
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:37,917
Come here.

379
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,433
There's a camera
in the motion detector.

380
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,238
I know what you're doing.

381
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,141
And I know who's behind it.

382
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,151
Last year Cortez
tried to kill you.

383
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:18,090
And I saved your life.

384
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,160
So who are you gonna believe?

385
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:37,109
Take the side door.

386
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:41,013
Get out of here.

387
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,173
- Then we have a deal.
- I'm good with that.

388
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,043
Let me tell her.

389
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,712
Devon's leaving.

390
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,847
He's let Kelly Anne go,
and you can go too.

391
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,057
And he's gonna back off
your business.

392
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,017
What does he get in return?

393
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,686
He's leaving with me so we can
settle our unfinished business.

394
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,387
No.

395
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,257
Last year, this man
showed loyalty to Camila

396
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,792
and nearly got you killed.

397
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,794
You're willing
to sacrifice everything,

398
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:05,097
including your life,
for this man?

399
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:08,534
Yes.

400
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,536
Has he told you about

401
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,372
his little excursion
with us in Texas?

402
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,642
He spared the man
you wanted to kill.

403
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,412
She doesn't know.

404
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,649
Well, allow me
to open your eyes.

405
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,383
Or better yet,
let's have the man

406
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,655
that you're willing to trade
your life for do it for you.

407
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,393
Devon sent me
to take out a man who had

408
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,630
hijacked one of his shipments.

409
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,431
You told me.

410
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,618
Mark?
No.

411
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,761
Mommy, what was that?
What's happening?

412
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,529
We caught someone
trying to break in.

413
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,107
I need you to go next door
to the neighbors.

414
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,933
Go, go, go.

415
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,380
Mommy, mommy.

416
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,851
No!

417
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,485
The man he took out

418
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,163
was part of a crew that
stole a shipment from me.

419
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,189
James was supposed
to take those men out,

420
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,958
make it look like a robbery.

421
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,394
Instead, he turned
the first one into a bloodbath,

422
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,363
where a little girl died.

423
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,908
Then grew a conscience
and decided to walk away

424
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,333
from the rest of the job.

425
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,970
I'm taking this piece of shit.

426
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,805
What you must decide,
Miss Mendoza,

427
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,507
now that you know
everything about him,

428
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,910
is are you willing
to sacrifice your life

429
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:00,913
in a futile attempt
to prevent that?

430
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:06,418
Take him.

431
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,291
Mano a mano.

432
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,692
I'm gonna like this.

433
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,795
Just like you like
watching me and Camila?

434
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,558
Camila and I will rule Mexico.

435
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,395
And there's no room
for a little boy.

436
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,840
Better her boy than her dog.

437
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,375
Cabrón.

438
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,388
Listen.

439
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,890
I'm not gonna let him take you.

440
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,057
But you just said...

441
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,526
I said that to buy us time.

442
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,071
There's someone
on the outer grounds.

443
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:30,897
Armed. Coming this way.

444
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,732
Check it out.
Collect the men.

445
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,902
- Okay.
- Get the car ready.

446
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,170
The cabinet behind me.

447
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:41,640
With the guns?
There's too many of them.

448
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,575

find my mother?

489
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,873
I have news.

490
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:30,476
Not sure if it's good or bad,
but...

491
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,511
He got away.

492
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,547
I do not recall
authorizing an audience.

493
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,916
You let him escape.

494
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,019
You failed me, General.

495
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,690
The cameras
were for your protection.

496
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,495
I apologize.

497
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,898
Hearing you speak to him the
way you did in that hotel, I...

498
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:56,068
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

499
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:59,271
It was all
information and sex.

500
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,373
That's all it was with him.

501
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,711
Lately,

502
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:09,248
nothing seems
to make me happy.

503
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,721
Well, I think I have something
that may change that for you.

504
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:19,191
In an unexpected offer
from a friend.

505
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:23,028
Something I think
you'll like very much.

506
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,737
We ran the phone number
Mendoza supplied again.

507
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,240
Problem's that El Santo's
people change them

508
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,409
so frequently that
this is one burnt now.

509
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:41,147
So she really did give up
her supplier for that bastard.

510
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,116
Loyalty to a fault.

511
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,318
Can't be bought either.

512
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:48,820
Told the brass I saw firsthand

513
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,922
you'd gone above and beyond
to get us that intel.

514
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,224
She found leverage on the fly

515
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,260
and backed me off
without a gun.

516
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,463
- I underestimated her.
- We all did, Devante.

517
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,831
We'll tighten things up
on our end.

518
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,900
Relocate your mother,
and our cyber team

519
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,469
will make sure your
sister and family

520
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,737
have no further
internet presence.

521
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,006
Where do they want me?

522
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,608
Chief of Station
wants you back

523
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,510
at your aviation business
in Chicago.

524
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,646
El Santo remains a priority
target for the agency.

525
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,185
We'll find another way at 'em.

526
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,522
I might already have one.

527
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:27,326
This might hurt.

528
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:32,531
Yeah.

529
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,507
You're good?

530
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,310
Yeah.

531
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,212
Listen.

532
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:50,482
If you want to leave,
I'll help set you up

533
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,951
anywhere you want
to go, okay?

534
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,987
I wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for you.

535
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,658
I'm not going anywhere.

536
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,429
Okay.

537
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,300
Andale, gabacha.

538
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,336
I'll check on dinner.

539
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,707
I fired that gun
like it was nothing.

540
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:19,245
I hit that guard.

541
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:22,581
I wasn't even thinking twice
if I killed him.

542
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:28,887
Shooting Cole, I knew
who I was and what I was doing.

543
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,890
And it killed me.

544
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:38,163
But I'm scared because today
I don't feel a thing.

545
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,501
Your husband beat you.

546
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,570
The men you shot at

547
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,772
wanted to kill us.

548
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,441
It is all right to feel nothing
for hurting the people

549
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,843
that want to destroy you.

550
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,946
You saved my life.

551
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,449
You're family now.

552
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,221
Thank you.

553
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,865
Let's eat.

554
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:17,269
Okay.

555
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,538
My God,
that smells amazing.

556
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,373
Pollo la crema.

557
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:25,444
The chicken's gonna taste
like it was born in the sauce.

558
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,650
Come on, prueba.

559
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:35,621
My gosh.

560
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:38,924
Hand me your plate.

561
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,773
House is yours now.
I'm gonna leave.

562
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,475
No.

563
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,944
Look, I'm no good for you here.
I mean, you could've lost

564
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,780
everything,
including your life.

565
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,682
And I lied to you,
right to your face.

566
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,852
Yes.
And I know why you did.

567
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,193
Her name was Suzie.

568
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,263
She couldn't have been more
than, like, six years old.

569
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,203
I can't stop
thinking about her.

570
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,973
You didn't mean
for that to happen.

571
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:36,047
You once told me there's no
good or bad in this business.

572
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,150
Right?

573
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,222
I'm not sure
I believe that anymore.

574
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,893
Because of that little girl?

575
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,161
Her.

576
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,832
And you.

577
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:57,235
Listen.

578
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,337
Whatever you've done,

579
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,841
you don't need to hide from me.

580
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,479
We're in this together.

581
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:16,154
I don't deserve that.

582
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,225
Everyone deserves that.

583
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:23,549
Andale, pues.

584
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:31,322
Let's go.
Let's get on with it.
