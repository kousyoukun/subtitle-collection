1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,836
THERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,672
We're gonna sell
on the dark web.

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,641
JAMES: Mail order cocaine?
TERESA: I have a guy.

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,343
His name's Ivan.
He's built me a site.

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,878
We're gonna ship
through a legitimate front

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,313
and get paid with
cryptocurrency.

7
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,048
We won't be cutting
into anyone's territory.

8
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,649
JAMES: No, but we still need
to transport through it.

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,418
Arizona's carved up
by five narcos.

10
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,220
They're called La Comisión.

11
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,854
There's a Mexican named Pecas.
He's the leader.

12
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:24,425
(speaking Spanish)

13
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,194
You're very light
on your feet, General.

14
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,695
Very impressed.

15
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,064
You're the one with the gifts,
mi jefa.

16
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,032
Just how much access
do you think I have?

17
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,502
I'm still on suspension.

18
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,004
(sighs)
This is not a good idea.

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,407
Here's a little piece
of Mexico to remember us by.

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,209
-Ah!
TERESA: We need your help.

21
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,843
As the business grows,
you can grow with it.

22
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,545
POTE: We buying a winery?

23
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,614
KELLY ANNE: This place has
an amazing wine cellar.

24
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,948
We can put our production
down here.

25
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,183
And we've set up
infrared cameras

26
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,718
all around the property.

27
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,886
And the entire system
is linked to your phone.

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,723
-This is my wife Kelly Anne.
-Hi.

29
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,591
POTE: Is the police
looking for you?

30
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,693
Officially,
I am a missing person.

31
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,295
And it's Priscilla now.

32
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,097
JAMES: I was working
with Devon Finch.

33
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,698
Someone hijacked
our shipment

34
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,234
and Devon wanted him
taken out.

35
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,202
Why take a chance?
Get it done.

36
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,304
(struggling)

37
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:11,372
(screams)

38
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,207
(coughs)

39
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,575
JAMES: You always said
there was a different way.

40
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,410
I wanna do things differently.

41
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:19,247
Let me in.

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,982
(Lil' Kim's
"Queen Bitch" playing)

43
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,884
KELLY ANNE:
Welcome to Perla Blanca.

44
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,620
We are fully committed
to offering our customers

45
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,256
the purest product.

00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,458
Come on in.
Have fun.

60
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,123
Keep eye-balling me.
I know I'm pretty.

61
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,958
You know, she has
a thing for strays.

62
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,429
Don't make her regret it.

63
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,765
Production's running smoothly,
Teresita.

64
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,802
The shipments are out the door.

65

JAMES: Selling
on the dark web,

85
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,437
cutting out the middle man, and
turning product into champagne.

86
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,206
TERESA: Yeah?
We did it.

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,242
No, you did it.

88
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:30,177
(romantic guitar music)

89
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,348
Now that we have a team,
we can expand.

90
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:37,885
Get big enough
where no one can hurt us.

91
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,922
$30 million in a month
is a good start.

92
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,791
You have your eyes
on something?

93
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,593
*

94
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,061
(exhales deeply)

95
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,463
A decent rib eye steak.

96
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:50,964
(chuckles)

97
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,133
I haven't had one
since we left Dallas.

98
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,735
How about you?

99
00:03:54,768 --> 00:04:01,375
*

100
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,645
I took flying lessons
when I was in Europe.

101
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,581
And if they come for me,
I'll be ready.

102
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,117
And if they come for you,
I'll be ready.

103
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,087
(chuckles)

104
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:18,125
You still don't trust me?

105
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,760
You're still here.

106
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,662
That's something.

it was like that, right?

00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,434
(laughter)

110
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,835
(overlapping chatter)

111
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,903
He's making it worse
than what I--

112
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,271
It was not that bad at all.

113
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,340
Oh, yeah.

114
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,974
(door opens and closes)

115
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,279
Good evening.

116
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,915
I'd like to arrange dinner
reservations for my boss.

117
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,453
We would love to accommodate
you, but we're closin'.

118
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,154
Hmm.

119
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,690
(tense music)

120
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,124
MAN: Hands up.
Hands in the air.

121
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,760
Don't move.
Don't move.

122
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,430
Gun on the floor,
or your brains on the wall.

123
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,766
Calm down.

124
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,869
Do not reach
for that panic button.

We real good, E.

128
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,711
Call your boss.
Now.

132
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,051
Hey.

133
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,120
DEVON (over phone):
Hello, Miss Mendoza.

134

*

135
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,892
I hear the Sangiovese does
well in this dry climate.

00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,326
Devon.

137
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,861
DEVON: I've just
arrived in Phoenix.

138
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,563
I have your manager
and I have your coke.

139
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,298
TERESA (over phone):
She's not part of my business.

140
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,535
Whatever the problem is,
we can fix it.

141
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,203
DEVON: Join me for dinner
at your winery.

142
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,838
This invitation
is not optional.

143
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,509
First course begins at eight.
Be here. Come alone.

144

ANCHOR: (speaking Spanish)

00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,395
(tense music)

148
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:06,066
*

149
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,335
Boaz has fled to Badiraguato.

150
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,171
His cousin
Javier Jimenez is helping him.

151
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,207
A wounded animal
always runs back home.

152
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,243
CORTEZ: He's desperate.

153
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:19,580
He sent a message
to his people.

154
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,949
He's begging for a truce,

155
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,084
for the sake of his son
and your daughter's union.

156
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,220
Boaz tried to kill me.
There is no truce.

157
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,790
Perhaps we can use Kique
to track him down.

158
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,693
I cannot involve my future
son-in-law in this.

159
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,762
That would destroy Isabela.

160
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,764
We must find another way.

161
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,632
You did good, General.

162
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,601
We're nearly free of Boaz.

163
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,872
But there is still
the matter of Teresa Mendoza.

164
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,275
Has Agent Loya provided you
with any further assistance?

165
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,145
He can only do so much until
the DEA reinstates him.

166
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,883
According to my sources,
he has been reinstated.

167
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,251
(ominous music)

168
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,620
Recently?

169
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,155
CORTEZ: Weeks ago.
And there's more.

170
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,125
They say the DEA's target
is no longer Boaz.

171
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,728
It's you.

172
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,497
And you trust your sources?

173
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,431
I trust no one.

174
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:15,402
But, given your history
with Agent Loya,

175
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,306
I suggest we err
on the side of caution.

176
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,308
*

177
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,011
Nobody touches Loya.

178
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:28,181
Not until I look at him in the
eye and speak to him myself.

179
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,917
Is that clear?

180
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,451
*

181
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,454
Como guste, Gobernadora.

182
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:41,495
*

183
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,831
(engine revs)

184
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,799
(tense music)

185
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,001
JAMES: There's no service
in the cellar,

186
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,302
but I'm sure Pote's safe.

187
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,305
Someone was watching us.

188
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,143
Or someone set us up.

189
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:02,049
*

190
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,784
LIL T: Any word from Pote
and the guys?

191
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,686
Not yet. Listen we're gonna
need your help.

192
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,556
Hey, when was the last time
you spoke to your uncle?

193
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,357
We don't speak anymore.
What's your point?

194
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,359
It's just a little convenient.

195
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,994
Pote kills your
gangbanger buddies,

196
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,129
you come work for us,
and now Devon finds us.

197
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,531
You think I led him here?

198
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,132
You know,
maybe it was your payback.

199
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,968
Teresa got shot when your ass
switched out the coke.

200
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,636
Don't talk
to me about loyalty.

201
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,573
I lost my family
over this shit.

202
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,141
I brought her here
because I trust her.

203
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,843
Whatever you need me
to do I'll do,

204
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,579
but if this pendejo
keeps stepping to me...

205
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,648
He won't.
Be ready to move, okay?

206
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,383
We're on our way to the winery.

207
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,818
Shit, born ready.

208
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,689
I'll call you.
Let's go.

209
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:46,093
*

210
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:52,566
Most domestic sparkling wine
is unremarkable.

211
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,501
You knew enough
to find Teresa a winery

212
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,270
that produces a supple
and elegant vintage.

213
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,840
I salute you, Priscilla.

214
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,909
Listen, I'm just
the manager here, okay?

215
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,277
I promise
I don't know anything.

216
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,713
You ran a wine club in Dallas?

217
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,348
My former attorney,
Cole Van Awken,

218
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,850
told me about your fine palate.

219
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,019
It's a shame
what happened to him,

220
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,854
isn't it, Kelly Anne?

221
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,522
(menacing music)

222
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,026
Take her downstairs.
Her time will come.

223
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,961
All right, Hannah Montana,
let's go.

224
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,964
Okay.

225
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:31,004
*

226
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,644
TERESA: They're moving
Kelly Anne.

227
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,479
If Devon wanted our coke,

228
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,914
he'd already be gone.

229
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,315
Why is he here?

230
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,051
Because he wants me.

231
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,054
For not taking out
that guy in Texas for him.

232
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,122
I'm gonna go in there
and work it out with him.

233
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,459
You hurt his business.
There's no working that out.

234
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,428
(foreboding music)

235
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,897
*

236
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,431
-I'm gonna go in.
-What're you doing?

237
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm not gonna let you
walk in there alone.

238
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,902
Listen to me.
Go to La Comisión for backup.

239
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,136
Have Ivan get something
on Devon

240
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,838
that we can use
against him.

241
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:08,241
Yeah, but he could hurt you
before that happens.

242
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,678
He wants something else.
It's safer this way.

243
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,682
Go to La Comisión.
I'll be okay.

244
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,418
*

245
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,454
KELLY ANNE: Ow (grunts).
VEE: Shut up.

246
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,961
VEE: Sit down.

247
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,329
(grunts)

248
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,365
Tie her ass up.

249
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,679
-Keep that bitch quiet.
-Mm-hmm.

250
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,715
(grunts)

251
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,018
(gasps)

252
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,020
(shushes)
Just me, gabacha.

253
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,487
Oh, thank God,
I thought they killed you.

254
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,857
I was in here when they hit us.

255
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,192
I'm gonna get us out of here.

256
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,061
But I need your help.

257
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,064
(suspenseful music)

258
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,399
*

259
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,069
Miss Mendoza.

260
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,370
*

261
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,707
DEVON: Perfect timing.

262
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,710
Dinner is served.

263
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,020
Where are my people?

264
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,722
DEVON: Your security
is being held by mine,

265
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,424
so that we may dine in peace.

266
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,194
-And my manager?
-You mean Kelly Anne?

267
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,664
She hasn't been harmed. Yet.

268
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,166
What do you want from me?

269
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,667
Direct as always.

270
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,170
I want an introduction
to El Santo.

271
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,772
(ominous music)

272
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,074
I have no way
to contact him directly.

273
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,776
Even if I could,

274
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,178
he only deals
with his followers.

275
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,880
You weren't always
one of his followers.

276
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,016
Yet you found your way
into his flock.

277
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,618
I don't doubt your powers of
persuasion, Miss Mendoza.

278
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,455
I can deliver you product,
but not him.

279
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,691
We can make that deal.

280
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,595
But you coming here like this,
it's not the man you are.

281
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,364
(chuckles)
Evelyn.

282
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,966
PROFESSOR:
(speaking Haitian Creole)

283
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,067
DEVON:
(speaking Haitian Creole)

284
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,602
She thinks she knows me.

285
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,006
(speaking Haitian Creole)

286
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,376
DEVON: Let me tell you
three things.

287
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,579
Those days between
you and me are over.

288
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,917
You have no clue who I am.

289
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,820
Tonight you're gonna find out.

290
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,421
*

291
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,989
POTE: I'm gonna take him out.

292
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,557
Then we run for the tunnel.

293
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,826
Okay,
but there's a whole bunch

294
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,093
more guards
all over the winery.

295
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,130
They got guns,
and, like, radios.

296
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,101
-Now you have one.
-I don't--

297
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,637
POTE: When they come for us,
you let 'em have it.

298
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,272
I don't think
that's a good idea.

299
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,974
I cleaned up
your husband.

300
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,575
I know you can shoot.

301
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,277
That was different.

302
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,512
You were in danger then,
you're in danger now.

303
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,315
We're like sitting ducks
in here.

304
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,684
(foreboding music)

305
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,021
I need your help.

306
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,656
Are you with me?

307
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,459
Or not?

308
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,462
(gasps)

309
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,629
(chuckles)

310
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,331
Andale, gabacha.

311
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,201
(exhales) Okay.

312
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,204
(traditional Mexican music)

313
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,340
JAMES: I thought I was meeting
with the full Comisión.

314
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,709
PECAS: We don't throw up
the Bat-Signal

315
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,013
every time you get
yourself into trouble.

316
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:37,317
They authorized me to hear
you out on their behalf.

317
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,818
So...

318
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,654
What did you do
to bring Devon Finch down here?

319
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,390
We're not clear
on that just yet.

320
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,559
Then I'm not sure
I can help you.

321
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,228
What's the point
of having a Comisión

322
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,197
if an outsider can come in
and do what he wants?

323
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,066
Since you arrived,
all we've seen is chaos.

324
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,468
You think the other members
are eager to go to war

325
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,137
with a Chicago gangster
on your behalf?

326
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,839
We backed off the Sheriff
on your behalf.

327
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:03,476
You're making money from us.
Now you just wanna screw us?

328
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,045
It's not my call.

329
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,180
I--I'll talk to the rest
of La Comisión.

330
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,316
But in the meantime,

331
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,419
see if you can't work
this out yourselves first.

332
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,554
*

333
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,656
I'll remember this.

334
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,659
PECAS: Okay.

335
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,028
*

336
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,662
(mimicking)
I'll remember this.

337
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,333
(chuckles)
(speaks Spanish)

338
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,435
(cell phone vibrating)

339
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,342
DEVON: Give me the phone.

340
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,910
Don't make me ask twice.

341
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,913
(tense music)

342
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:44,784
*

343
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,954
Hey, my old friend.

344
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,755
I'm here with Teresa.

345
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,757
DEVON (over phone): We just
started our second course.

346
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,460
Look, whatever this is,
whatever game you're playing--

347
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,195
Did you really think you
weren't gonna see me again?

348
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,896
That's got nothing
to do with Teresa.

349
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,132
It does now.
So why don't you come in here,

350
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,800
meet me face to face?

351
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,769
JAMES (over phone):
Just know, if you hurt her--

352
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:07,274
*

353
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,076
You came here for revenge.

354
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,544
From James, yes.

355
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,082
From you,
I told you what I want.

356
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,717
If you hurt me,

357
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,920
you won't need
to look for El Santo.

358
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,555
He'll find you.

359
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,924
One last chance,
Miss Mendoza.

360
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,961
I want a line to your supplier.

361
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,130
*

362
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,464
Bring me her friend.

363
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,167
Wait.

364
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,769
He gave me a number
for emergencies only.

365
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,805
I have it memorized.

366
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,640
*

367
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,642
You and the numbers.

368
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:49,682
*

369
00:15:54,121 --> 00:16:00,227
*

370
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,801
Everything okay?

371
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,711
What's on your mind?

372
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,816
I understood the rules
when we started this.

373
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,955
We had common goals

374
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,991
and the exchange of information
helped us both.

375
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,532
The rest of it

376
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,968
was

377
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,804
unexpected.

378
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,574
Lovely.

379
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,776
It has been.

380
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,349
I know the DEA reinstated you.

381
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,354
And I know their goal
is no longer Boaz, but me.

382
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,562
You think I lied to you?

383
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,767
I don't wanna believe that.

384
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,772
I don't know who's been
telling you these things.

385
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:23,110
But I'd ask you
what they have to gain.

386
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,112
I saved your life
when I didn't know you.

387
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,380
You think I'd set you up
now that I do?

388
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,882
We've been at war, Camila.

389
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,919
But in this thing here,

390
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,224
I'm with you.

391
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,793
Say it again.

392
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm with you.

393
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,376
(ominous music)

394
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:03,416
*

00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:07,654

396
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:14,694
*

397
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,077
(heavy breathing and kissing
through headphones)

398
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:38,117
*

399
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,292
TERESA: Are you Haitian?

400
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,926
Excuse me?

401
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,761
You sound like you're Haitian.

402
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,130
PROFESSOR: Ah.

403
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,636
If I were you,
I'd mind my own damn business.

404
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,811
(tense music)

405
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,279
*

406
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,014
Are you seeing this?

407
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,382
JAMES: She's telling us
something.

408
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,950
That woman.

409
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,119
-Do a search on her.
-On it.

410
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,787
JAMES (over phone): Whatever
you get, send it to Lil T,

411
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,855
ASAP.

412
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,157
Done.

413
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,193
*

414
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,961
That number you gave us

415
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,163
tracks to a pay phone
on the coast of Ecuador.

416
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,533
El Santo has
followers everywhere.

417
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,735
-It must be a drop phone.
DEVON: That's bullshit.

418
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,870
And you're just buying time.

419
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,374
Bring me her friend.

420
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,043

-Okay.

You have the keys
to the tunnel?

428
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,830
The guards took 'em.

429
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,198
Stay there.
Cover me.

430
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,201
Okay.

VEE: Get your ass out here.

KELLY ANNE: Don't shoot.

438
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,931
I don't ha--I don't have a gun.

439
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,067
Get down on your knees now.

440
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,070
Okay.

DEVON: I'm gonna ask you
once, nicely.

445
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,671
How does Teresa get
in contact with El Santo?

446
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:12,672
*

447
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,273
I don't know.

448
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:17,243
She doesn't.
Let her go.

449
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,779
I have a better idea.

450
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,614
Let's go swimming.

451
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:24,784
What?

452
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,986
*

453
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,621
What does he mean "swimming"?

454
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,490
-Put her on the board.
-What does he--

455
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,292
No, no, no, no.
(whimpers)

456

-What--
TERESA: No.

457
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:38,498
DEVON: Give me El Santo
and I'll let her go.

-We gotta go back in.
-No, we're outnumbered.

We rush in now, they kill
Teresa and Kelly Anne.

-Where's Tonto and Charger?
-I don't know.

Teresa!

TERESA:
She doesn't know anything.

Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

TERESA: Listen to me,
don't do this.

472
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,647
Stop it, you're gonna kill her.

473
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,315
Just let her go.

474
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,684
I'll give you
anything you want.

475

*

494
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,151
Last year Cortez
tried to kill you.

495

*

496
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:18,090
And I saved your life.

497
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,160
So who are you gonna believe?

498
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:28,200
*

499
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:37,109
Take the side door.

500
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:41,013
LOYA: Get out of here.

501

CORTEZ: (speaking Spanish)

(speaking Spanish)

512
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,173
DEVON: Then we have a deal.
JAMES: I'm good with that.

513
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,043
Let me tell her.

514
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,712
Devon's leaving.

515
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,847
He's let Kelly Anne go,
and you can go too.

516
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,048
And he's gonna back off
your business.

517
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,017
What does he get in return?

518
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,686
He's leaving with me so we can
settle our unfinished business.

519
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,387
No.

520
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,257
DEVON: Last year, this man
showed loyalty to Camila

521
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,792
and nearly got you killed.

522
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,794
You're willing
to sacrifice everything,

523
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:05,097
including your life,
for this man?

524
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:08,534
Yes.

525
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,536
Has he told you about

526
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,372
his little excursion
with us in Texas?

527
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,642
He spared the man
you wanted to kill.

528
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,043
(chuckles)

529
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,412
Oh, she doesn't know.

530
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,649
Well, allow me
to open your eyes.

531
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,383
Or better yet,
let's have the man

532
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,655
that you're willing to trade
your life for do it for you.

533
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,393
Devon sent me
to take out a man who had

534
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,630
hijacked one of his shipments.

535
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,431
You told me.

536
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,836
(ominous music)

537
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,604

00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,618
Mark?
No.

(screaming)

543
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,258
(neck snaps)

544
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,761
SUZIE: Mommy, what was that?
What's happening?

545
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,529
We caught someone
trying to break in.

546
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,098
I need you to go next door
to the neighbors.

547
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,933
Go, go, go.

548
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:20,539
*

549
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,380
SUZIE: Mommy, mommy.

550
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,851
No!
(explosion)

551
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,485
DEVON: The man he took out

552
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,154
was part of a crew that
stole a shipment from me.

553
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,189
James was supposed
to take those men out,

554
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,958
make it look like a robbery.

555
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,394
Instead, he turned
the first one into a bloodbath,

556
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,363
where a little girl died.

557
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,898
Then grew a conscience
and decided to walk away

558
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,333
from the rest of the job.

559
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,970
I'm taking this piece of shit.

560
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,805
What you must decide,
Miss Mendoza,

561
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,507
now that you know
everything about him,

562
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,910
is are you willing
to sacrifice your life

563
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:00,913
in a futile attempt
to prevent that?

564
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:02,915
*

565
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:06,418
Take him.

566
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,921
*

567
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:17,163

*

572
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,291
Mano a mano.

573
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,692
I'm gonna like this.

574
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,795
Just like you like
watching me and Camila?

575
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,063

576

579

Camila and I will rule Mexico.

580
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,395
And there's no room
for a little boy.

I'm not gonna let him take you.

594

But you just said--

595
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,526
I said that to buy us time.

VEE: There's someone
on the outer grounds.

Armed. Coming this way.

Check it out.
Collect the men.

-Okay.
-Get the car ready.

The cabinet behind me.

With the guns?
There's too many of them.

00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,547
I do not recall
authorizing an audience.

663
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,916
You let him escape.

664
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,019
You failed me, General.

665
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,690
CORTEZ: The cameras
were for your protection.

666
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,495
I apologize.

667
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,898
Hearing you speak to him the
way you did in that hotel, I...

668
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:56,068
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

669
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:59,271
It was all
information and sex.

670
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,373
That's all it was with him.

671
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,711
Lately,

672
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:09,248
nothing seems
to make me happy.

673
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,618
(ominous music)

674
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,721
Well, I think I have something
that may change that for you.

675
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:19,191
In an unexpected offer
from a friend.

676
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:23,028
Something I think
you'll like very much.

677
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:28,767
*

678
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,737
LIN: We ran the phone number
Mendoza supplied again.

679
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,240
Problem's that El Santo's
people change them

680
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,409
so frequently that
this is one burnt now.

681
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:41,147
So she really did give up
her supplier for that bastard.

682
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,116
Loyalty to a fault.

683
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,318
Can't be bought either.

684
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:48,820
Told the brass I saw firsthand

685
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,922
you'd gone above and beyond
to get us that intel.

686
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,224
She found leverage on the fly

687
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,260
and backed me off
without a gun.

688
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,463
-I underestimated her.
-We all did, Devante.

689
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,831
We'll tighten things up
on our end.

690
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,900
Relocate your mother,
and our cyber team

691
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,469
will make sure your
sister and family

692
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,737
have no further
internet presence.

693
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,006
Where do they want me?

694
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,608
Chief of Station
wants you back

695
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,510
at your aviation business
in Chicago.

696
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,646
El Santo remains a priority
target for the agency.

697
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,283
(percussive music)

698
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,185
We'll find another way at 'em.

699

*

700
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,522
I might already have one.

701
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:27,326
This might hurt.

702
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,361
KELLY ANNE: (hisses)

703
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:32,531
Yeah.

704
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:36,067
(refrigerator door opens)

705
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,507
You're good?

706
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,310
Yeah.

707
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,212
TERESA: Listen.

708
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:50,482
If you want to leave,
I'll help set you up

709
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,951
anywhere you want
to go, okay?

710
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,987
I wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for you.

711
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,658
I'm not going anywhere.

712
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,429
Okay.

713
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,300
POTE: Andale, gabacha.

714
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,336
I'll check on dinner.

715
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,707
KELLY ANNE: I fired that gun
like it was nothing.

716
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:19,245
I hit that guard.

717
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:22,581
I wasn't even thinking twice
if I killed him.

718
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,350
(ominous music)

719
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:28,887
Shooting Cole, I knew
who I was and what I was doing.

720
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,890
And it killed me.

721
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,759
*

722
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:38,163
But I'm scared because today
I don't feel a thing.

*

724
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,501
Your husband beat you.

725
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,570
The men you shot at

726
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,772
wanted to kill us.

727
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,441
It is all right to feel nothing
for hurting the people

728
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,843
that want to destroy you.

729
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,946
You saved my life.

730
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,449
You're family now.

Okay.

Oh, my God,
that smells amazing.

737
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,373
Pollo la crema.

738
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:25,444
The chicken's gonna taste
like it was born in the sauce.

No.

748
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,944
Look, I'm no good for you here.
I mean, you could've lost

749
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,780
everything,
including your life.

750
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,682
And I lied to you,
right to your face.

751
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,852
Yes.
And I know why you did.

752
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,193
Her name was Suzie.

753
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,263
She couldn't have been more
than, like, six years old.

(somber music)

755
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,203
I can't stop
thinking about her.

756
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,973
You didn't mean
for that to happen.

*

758
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:36,047

good or bad in this business.

760

I believe that anymore.

764

Her.

Listen.

Whatever you've done,

770
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,841
you don't need to hide from me.
