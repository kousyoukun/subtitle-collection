1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:02,339
<i>Previously
on "Queen of the South"...</i>

2
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:03,859
I'm done with this business.

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,605
<i>Let's be a family
before the world</i>

4
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:07,006
<i>tries to tear us apart again.</i>

5
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,508
Don't!

6
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:10,878
Agh!

7
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:12,513
<i>Camila is playing you.</i>

8
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:14,415
Just 'cause our kids are
engaged to be married,

9
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:16,184
you don't think
I'll kill the bitch?

10
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,198
<i>Isabela, it's okay.</i>

11
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:29,534
You do what you need to do.

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,102
You'll get no interference
from me.

13
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:32,604
We're nearly free of Boaz,

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,274
but there is still the matter
of Teresa Mendoza.

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,743
Whatever you've done,

16
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:40,246
you don't need
to hide from me.

17
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:42,048
<i>It's Pecas.</i>

18
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,083
Came across a little something
here in Phoenix.

19
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,120
<i>You might be interested.</i>

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,594
<i>Mi amor, es espactular.</i>

21
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,128
<i>Gracias.</i>

22
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:24,801
For 25 years together.

23
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:27,270
And every night
I thank the heavens

24
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:29,707
that you decided to marry
a <i>baboso</i> like me.

25
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:31,478
<i>Salud.</i>

26
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:37,382
What's wrong?
You're not drinking.

27
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:41,687
I found a very...
large transfer

28
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:43,724
in our bank statement today.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,993
You know,
just out of curiosity,

30
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:48,730
how much longer am I gonna
keep paying for your whore?

31
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:51,532
I couldn't turn away
someone in need.

32
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:54,335
You can be as generous
as you want with your dick,

33
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:56,205
just not with my money.

34
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,575
And I'm gonna tell you
something else.

35
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:02,412
If I ever see...

36
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:04,815
that you deposit
one more cent

37
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,652
to that <i>puta...</i>

38
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,253
she's dead.

39
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,391
Your rage

40
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:15,561
and desire for revenge

41
00:02:15,597 --> 00:02:17,931
will be your end,
<i>mi vida.</i>

42
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,175
Happy anniversary.

43
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,911
Enjoy your watch.

44
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:42,895
<i>¿Bueno?</i>

45
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,103
What can I do for you, Boaz?

46
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,304
You know, <i>mi amigo</i> Pecas
picked up Teresa Mendoza

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,074
as a favor for me.

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,409
<i>I handed them over
to your</i> pinche <i>general.</i>

49
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,312
<i>Still got to collect
my bounty.</i>

50
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:59,048
Say I give you
the family discount.

51
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:01,918
Thanks...

52
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:04,253
but I don't pay debt
to a dead man.

53
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,156
See you on the other side...

54
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:07,725
<i>suegro.</i>

55
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:49,341
These will be
your accommodations

56
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:52,112
during your stay back home.

57
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,214
I hope...

58
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,817
that you will find them
up to your...

59
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,387
high standards, Teresa.

60
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,790
I would like to speak
with Camila.

61
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,491
She needs to know
what will happen

62
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,027
if I don't walk out of here.

63
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,798
<i>La gobernadora</i> will see you
when she's ready.

64
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,298
Until then...

65
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,401
You two can catch up.

66
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,082
No, no...

67
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,153
Guero?

68
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:28,722
No.

69
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,192
Teresa?

70
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,863
No.

71
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:36,791
Subtitles by explosiveskull

72
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,713
Where are you?

73
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,560
Hey, look, I'm on my way
to the meeting spot,

74
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:45,748
but I got a little bit
of heat on me.

75
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,057
Okay, lose them first.

76
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,992
Meet us at the port.

77
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:51,763
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

78
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,948
<i>Se fue, idiota.</i>

79
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,628
Tell me where she is,

80
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:48,899
and I'll untie you
and treat you like a king.

81
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,368
Sushi...

82
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:53,737
micheladas...

00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:56,407
pedicures...
anything you want, Guero.

84
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:05,718
She left you
high and dry.

85
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:07,888
Save yourself.

86
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,376
Ah!

87
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,253
<i>Doctor!</i>

88
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,022
<i>Ayúdale.</i>

89
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,107
<i>Tomás.</i>

90
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:07,460
If it wasn't for that doctor,
I'd be gone by now.

91
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:10,663
You didn't give up
Marbella to Cortez?

92
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,933
What, and tell him
that was our plan? Hell, no.

93
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,336
Cortez could beat me
for another eight months,

94
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:16,938
and I wouldn't betray you.

95
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:19,141
I went to Malta instead.

96
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,076
Should've looked for you.

97
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:22,678
No, it's good that you didn't.

98
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:24,413
That's what Camila wanted.

99
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,950
I knew that she'd bring
you here one of these days.

100
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:29,653
I think I got a plan for us
to try and get out of here.

101
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:36,261
You're the only thing
that's kept me alive, Teresa.

102
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,673
I know they did it.

103
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,110
Pecas is the type of man that
doesn't like to be accused.

104
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,046
Well, if La Comisión
didn't take her,

105
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:52,881
they know who did.

106
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,017
Sometimes the fly needs honey,

107
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,686
sometimes the hammer.

108
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:58,454
You choose the wrong one,

109
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,957
and you get nothing.

110
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:02,894
We don't have time.

111
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:07,399
Pecas!

112
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:10,169
Where is she?

113
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:13,073
Can't a guy enjoy
his doughnuts on cheat day?

114
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,675
- I know you have her.
- Sit down.

115
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,511
Relax. Have a bear claw.
It's on me.

116
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:28,591
You hit like a little girl.

117
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:35,733
I delivered Teresa
to my connect.

118
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,003
So she's in Mexico?

119
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,438
Maybe.

120
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:41,073
Maybe not.

121
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:46,113
I turned her over
to one of Boaz's guys.

122
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,681
That's all I know.

123
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:49,016
James...

124
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:50,852
Listen to your friend, Romeo.

125
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:52,754
Teresa's a hot boss.

126
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,024
But thinking
with your little pee-pee's

127
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,859
going to get you killed.

128
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:59,895
Call Boaz... now.

129
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,804
The plan didn't work, <i>pendejo!</i>

130
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,773
And now the crazy <i>perra</i>
is after me.

131
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,309
Well, that's what you get for
negotiating with Camila Vargas.

132
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,612
Who the hell is this?
Where's Pecas?

133
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,982
This is James.

134
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:17,950
Pinche Santiago!

135
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:20,586
You want to get revenge
on Camila,

136
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,290
take away what she wants most.

137
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,159
Help me find Teresa.

138
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,794
If it means hurting
that <i>perra,</i> I'll help you,

139
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,729
but I don't know
where your girl is,

140
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,597
just that Camila's got her.

141
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,013
We're getting
on a plane to Mexico.

142
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:44,083
Malta, huh?

143
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,984
I always knew you were destined
for some badass shit.

144
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:49,522
Just like a little
cocaine princess.

145
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:53,761
It's a long way from
counting money in Culiacán.

146
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,329
Yeah.

147
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:57,801
I learned cryptocurrency...

148
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:01,170
Banking without cash.

149
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:03,372
No shit.

150
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:05,442
Then I made an enemy, so...

151
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:07,211
we fled to Phoenix.

152
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,214
I bought a winery
as front for the business

153
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,715
and a plane.

154
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,384
I'm learning how to fly.

155
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:18,324
Oh, Jesus, that's the kicker
right there.

156
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,128
You started to solo yet?

157
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:22,796
Soon.

158
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,965
I'm gonna be
your first passenger.

159
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,271
- Okay.
- Can't wait.

160
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,184
Hello, Teresa.

161
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,720
It's good to see you here.

162
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:44,755
You like the surprise?

163
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:50,662
I picked you up...

164
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:53,166
when this rat
left you for dead.

165
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:56,770
I housed you.

166
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,705
I protected you.

167
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,909
No.

168
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:03,579
You sent James to kill me.

169
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,680
I hear that he works
for you now.

170
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,950
He followed his dick
right back to you.

171
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:10,253
And now you share a house...

172
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:13,391
and a bed.

173
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,893
But he couldn't
protect you from me,

174
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:17,962
so here we are.

175
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:20,098
You see, eventually,

176
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,635
we all have to pay
for our sins.

177
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:46,997
You killed Epifanio.

178
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:50,402
And you allowed me
to watch him die in my arms.

179
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,609
Your need for power

180
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,711
is what got Epifanio killed.

181
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:02,016
It wasn't me.

182
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:03,517
I have an employee

183
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:05,420
who hacked into your
Cayman Islands accounts.

184
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,790
By now,
he knows you've taken me.

185
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:11,361
He's been instructed
to transfer 10 million pesos

186
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,964
from Sinaloa State Bank
into one of them.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,337
After that, he'll make
the transfer public.

188
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,673
You expect me
to believe that shit?

189
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,677
You know what will happen
when Sinaloa discovers

190
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:27,179
you're just another
dirty politician.

191
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,321
You're going to watch...

192
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,990
the love of your life die

193
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:05,826
a slow...

194
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:09,864
And painful death.

195
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,269
A death of 1,000 cuts.

196
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,608
No, no!

197
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,638
And, Teresa...

198
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:47,477
there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.

199
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:00,995
It's okay.

200
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:06,318
I mean, what are the chances
that I could find a house

201
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:08,031
with an airplane hangar in it?

202
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,267
You moved your other
girlfriend in first.

203
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:18,143
We got a pool house
around the corner.

204
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,999
We can take afternoon naps.

205
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,768
We can... I mean, we can do
whatever you want.

206
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,919
Come on, check out the inside.

207
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,489
- I can't believe this.
- Believe it.

208
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:31,492
Check this out.
This is my favorite part.

209
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:34,329
It's a bedroom.

210
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:37,633
I mean,
it's not much now, but...

211
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,402
It's perfect.

212
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:50,949
Messing with
Camila's accounts...

213
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,984
that was smart.

214
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,856
She wants revenge more than
the power or the money.

215
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:58,992
It will only buy us time.

216
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,762
Well, that's what we need.

217
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:04,866
And Cortez... he thinks
he's got it all figured out.

218
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:07,269
He's got locks on every door

219
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,872
and guards 24-7.

220
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,675
<i>But he can't control
everything.</i>

221
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,208
I have to stay alive.

222
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:10,445
Shh, shh, shh.

223
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,381
<i>Para</i> Teresa.

224
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:49,159
<i>The doctor couldn't
watch me suffer anymore.</i>

225
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:52,229
Now that you're here,
we've got a shot.

226
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:54,065
Every night...

227
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:55,600
one of the guards...
he goes out,

228
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:58,102
and he calls his mom
on the phone,

229
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,938
leaves the other guard alone,

230
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:02,275
and that's when we strike.

231
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:23,166
Isabela, wait...

232
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:25,102
I'm in a meeting, Isabela.

233
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:26,604
I need to speak
with you, alone.

234
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,375
It's important.

235
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:36,650
Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

236
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:38,952
Some big news?

237
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:40,854
I don't know
what you're talking about.

238
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,623
Kique told me you have Teresa.

239
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:44,559
His father told him she's here.

240
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,896
Why did I have
to hear it from him?

241
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,965
You promised you'd tell me.

242
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,567
She killed my father.

243
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,336
I deserve to see her today.

244
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,871
I don't think it's a good idea.

245
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,373
That prison
is no place for you.

246
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,075
I'm not asking
for your permission.

247
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,910
I know where she is,
and I have the right.

248
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,347
Isabela,
your mother has said no.

249
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,986
If I spoke to my mother
like that,

250
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:09,188
I would not be standing here
right now.

251
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:10,691
My father would kill me.

252
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:13,561
That disrespect can lead
to serious consequence.

253
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,097
This is between me
and my mom.

254
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,365
She's right.

255
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:19,501
This is family business.

256
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,771
I won't have you
threatening my daughter.

257
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:23,339
My apologies.

258
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:29,714
You heard my decision.

259
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,851
Isabela...

260
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,804
He's on the phone.
We need to go now.

261
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,045
- Keep an eye on him.
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,620
Okay.

263
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:23,178
<i>Oye!</i>

264
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:46,873
<i>Oye. ¿Qué está pasando?</i>

265
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,717
Come on.

266
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:05,061
Isabela, put the gun down.
Guero, it's okay.

267
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:07,031
We got to get out of here,
Teresa, now.

268
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,299
It's okay.

269
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:09,868
You took my father from me.

270
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:13,305
The person to blame,
Isabela, is your mother.

271
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:14,507
Okay?

272
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:16,844
I will kill you.

273
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,752
- There's a car out back.
- Come on, let's go.

274
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,161
That's Isabela's car.

275
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,336
- You okay?
- Yeah.

276
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:12,477
- <i>¿Está bien?</i>
- <i>Sí.</i>

277
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,347
Shit.

278
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:28,783
Damn it, the tires.

279
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,063
- You okay?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

280
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,901
We need to
get you to the doctor.

281
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,405
Tomás's clinic is close.

282
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:48,040
He'll help me.

283
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,216
Isabela...

284
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:00,789
Teresa got away.

285
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:03,893
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

286
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,598
- No.
- Come on.

287
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:11,502
I tried to kill her.

288
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,137
And I couldn't.

289
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:15,006
- I'm so sorry, Mom.
- Shh, shh. Shh. Shh.

290
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:18,678
I told you not to come here.

291
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,781
I said I was sorry.

292
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:25,084
You disrespected me.

293
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,454
There will be
serious consequences.

294
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,458
This wasn't about you.

295
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:32,995
- I did it for me.
- Really?

296
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:34,530
You're forbidden
from seeing Kique.

297
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,099
That's crazy.
We're getting married.

298
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:38,535
Not anymore.

299
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:40,036
The wedding's off.

300
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,205
Until you learn how to make
better decisions,

301
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,541
I'm making them for you.

302
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:48,714
I'm doing what's best for you.

303
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,482
You'll thank me one day.

304
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:53,653
- Come on.
- No!

305
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,392
You just want me to spend
the rest of my life

306
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:00,294
by your side...

307
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,999
just as miserable and alone...

308
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:05,200
as you are.

309
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:19,751
Teresa and Guero nearly took

310
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:21,487
my daughter from me tonight.

311
00:23:21,523 --> 00:23:24,323
Isabela may hate me now,

312
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,660
but eventually
she'll understand

313
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,361
that what I did
was best for her.

314
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:30,167
No.

315
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:32,366
It is I who failed you both.

316
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,502
You kept me out of harm's way,

317
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,571
and for that, I'm grateful.

318
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:38,875
Their escape is not your fault.

319
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:42,612
I'm just thankful
that Isabela's all right.

320
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:46,249
Maybe it was meant to be.

321
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:47,951
I promise you,

322
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:50,955
I will not relent
until I lay Teresa at your feet

323
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:52,958
like hunted prey.

324
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,799
I have no doubt
you'll bring her to me.

325
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:02,703
You're my most loyal soldier.

326
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:05,238
It's rare when a man
can find a woman

327
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:07,976
so worthy
of his complete loyalty.

328
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:10,379
Thank you, General.

329
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,784
Are your soldiers
searching the area?

330
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,320
Teresa and Guero
are fleeing on foot.

331
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,860
They won't get far.

332
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,529
- Okay?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:57,138 --> 00:24:58,971
- Hi.
- Doctor, I'm sorry.

334
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:00,874
We didn't have... we didn't
have anywhere else to go.

335
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,443
He won't stop bleeding.
Please help us.

336
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,581
Come inside, come on.

337
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:14,523
That's a bad cut.

338
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,225
It's close to the artery.

339
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,664
- You're Teresa?
- Yes.

340
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:22,268
Thank you for helping us.

341
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:36,383
We're leaving
as soon as we can.

342
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,020
Is there a phone I can use?

343
00:25:39,223 --> 00:25:41,191
Thank you.

344
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:49,699
Yeah?

345
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:51,401
It's me.

346
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:52,569
Teresa.

347
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:54,605
Are you okay? Where are you?

348
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm safe.

349
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,109
I'm in a town
just outside of Culiacán.

350
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:00,745
I'm with Guero.

351
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:03,548
I'm with Pote.
We just landed in Sinaloa.

352
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:06,519
We've got some of Boaz's men.
We've been looking for you.

353
00:26:06,555 --> 00:26:08,255
- Boaz?
- I'll explain later.

354
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,923
Where exactly are you?

355
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:12,459
I'm in a clinic in Imala.

356
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:15,063
- She's in Imala.
- Oh, that's close by.

357
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,464
All right, we're on our way.

358
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,366
Please, hurry.

359
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:21,204
Is she okay?

360
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,807
- She's with Guero.
- Guero?

361
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:26,476
I thought
that <i>pendejo</i> was dead.

362
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,779
I guess not.

363
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,450
How's your hand?

364
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:34,786
If there's trouble,
I need to count on you.

365
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:40,160
I'm good... now.

366
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:44,098
Quit driving like
a <i>pinche viejita...</i>

367
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,934
and go.

368
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,774
Thank you.

369
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,200
What's this?

370
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,535
We're celebrating.

371
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:18,206
Hey.

372
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:21,209
- My birthday is tomorrow.
- I know this.

373
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:23,512
But I got to make a run
for Epi tomorrow.

374
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,983
I got you a present, though.

375
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:31,822
What is it?

376
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,557
It's the deed to the house.

377
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:35,160
It's yours.

378
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:40,199
No, I can't take this.
This is too much.

379
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,001
No, no, listen,
if anything were to happen,

380
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,469
I want you to have that.

381
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:50,478
It's getting cold.

382
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:56,219
You two are lucky
you got here when you did.

383
00:27:56,255 --> 00:27:57,686
Guero's lost a lot of blood.

384
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:00,890
I need more gauze.

385
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:03,394
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

386
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,731
Listen, James and Pote
are in Mexico.

387
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:09,001
They're coming to help us.

388
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:11,437
So it's true. You and James
are working together again?

389
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:14,674
- Yeah.
- You didn't have to call him.

390
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,411
We made it this far,
didn't we?

391
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,747
- Yeah.
- Just you and me, babe.

392
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,119
- We got this.
- I know.

393
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:26,922
Doctor, I need to see you!

394
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,558
Do you have a back door?

395
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:31,361
Okay.

396
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:35,133
- Come on. This way?
- Doctor!

397
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,572
We need to hide
until James gets here.

398
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:42,574
Let's go.

399
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:46,645
Doctor, I know you're in there.
Open the door!

400
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:19,839
It seems I might have
injured my wrist.

401
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,810
Maybe something for the pain.

402
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:30,952
Perhaps you pulled a muscle.

403
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:33,189
I can wrap it up
just in case.

404
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:36,159
Was there a problem
in your prison?

405
00:29:36,195 --> 00:29:37,662
Guero escaped.

406
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:40,531
Someone slipped him this.

407
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,967
You know anything about it?

408
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:44,303
No.

409
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,105
Could've been one
of the guards.

410
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,940
No.

411
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:50,176
They're both dead.

412
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:51,878
Guero and his woman...

413
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:53,947
killed them both.

414
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:56,550
Teresa Mendoza,
I'm sure you heard of her.

415
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,454
She murdered our beloved
governor, Epifanio Vargas.

416
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,056
- She did?
- In cold blood...

417
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,160
in front of his wife and child.

418
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:06,129
Well, I'm sure
you'll find them.

419
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,567
You have, uh,

420
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:12,671
another patient here
this evening?

421
00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:17,376
Excuse me?

422
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:19,679
A patient cut herself
making dinner.

423
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:20,849
Forgot to clean up.

424
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:24,318
I hope you won't inform
the health department, General.

425
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,897
Was your wife here

426
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,900
when this other patient
came in?

427
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,571
She's visiting her mother
this week with the baby.

428
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:43,908
I'm here stuck alone, eating
quesadillas three times a day.

429
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:49,414
What a shame.

430
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,917
All alone...

431
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:53,754
with your quesadillas.

432
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:05,300
Should I ask your wife

433
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:07,804
who else you're hiding?

434
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:39,908
<i>El doctor Tomás...</i>

435
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:45,416
Such a good, good man.

436
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:05,673
It's James and Pote. Let's go.

437
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:13,183
I'm here.

438
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:14,885
Okay, let's go.

439
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,228
Listen, Cortez will follow us.
You have time to go, okay?

440
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:24,864
Get as far away
as you can, all right?

441
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,233
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

442
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:36,811
We have to make
a run for it, okay?

443
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:37,879
I'll be right next to you.

444
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,682
- Let's go.
- Yeah, go.

445
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:44,487
Ah!

446
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:48,225
- Are you okay?
- I got hit!

447
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,695
Cover me!

448
00:32:59,942 --> 00:33:01,508
Come on, let's get
out of here!

449
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:04,043
We can't leave him.
Come on, help me out.

450
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,880
<i>Vamos!</i>

451
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,935
The bullet just grazed you.
It's gonna be okay.

452
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:44,238
It hurts like a bitch.

453
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:47,307
I know.

454
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:54,352
Hey, James, thanks
for helping us out, man.

455
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,455
Hey, Pote, it's good
to see you, too, man.

456
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:59,822
Looks like you lost
a little bit of weight.

457
00:34:01,494 --> 00:34:03,394
Is he coming
to Phoenix with us?

458
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,466
Yeah.

459
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:09,803
All right, we need another guy
at the winery.

460
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:14,974
And Teresa's been shopping
for planes, so...

461
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,010
we could use another pilot.

462
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:19,413
Listen, whatever you guys need,
I'm all-in.

463
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:34,597
Camila, don't do this.

464
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:36,334
And, please,
take your ring back.

465
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,470
I made up my mind.

466
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:43,708
If you need to expand
the business in Dallas,

467
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:45,978
I can send Batman
to run the operation.

468
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,813
Batman is not a businessman.

469
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:50,351
He'll run the entire
organization into the ground.

470
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,120
Camila, I love you,

471
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,488
and I need you by my side

472
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,823
to run the campaign
for governorship.

473
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,893
The people love you.

474
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,397
Having you on my arm will win
me all the votes I need.

475
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:06,137
You just want to keep me
under your thumb.

476
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,706
I'm not that woman.

477
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:10,542
I thought you knew that.

478
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:13,912
You want to throw
a 25-year marriage away,

479
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:16,582
then so be it.

480
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:18,552
Good luck in Dallas.

481
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:20,154
I won't be there
to protect you.

482
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,056
I don't need you.

483
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:25,025
I can protect myself.

484
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:31,767
Camila, you are like
fire on steel.

485
00:35:31,803 --> 00:35:33,869
You know how to make
the most challenging men

486
00:35:33,905 --> 00:35:35,771
bend to your will.

487
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:38,742
I speak from experience.

488
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:40,411
Use that gift.

489
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,413
It might keep you safe.

490
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,241
There's a Taco Bell.

491
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,513
Does anybody need a chalupa?

492
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:11,048
No.

493
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:13,418
How about one
of those tall slushies?

494
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:15,053
It's like a bump
of coke, man.

495
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,754
It'll keep you awake
all the way to Phoenix.

496
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,391
I'm good, thanks.

497
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,461
How about you, Teresita?

498
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:23,762
I'm good, thank you.

499
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:26,503
Guero, do you need something?

500
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:30,508
Guero?

501
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,212
Guero?

502
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:37,846
Pote, he's not breathing.
Guero...

503
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:40,783
Guero? Guero?

504
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:42,152
Guero...

505
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:11,820
Here you go.

506
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:14,057
Is it all for me?

507
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:15,859
No, it's for us.

508
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:17,328
It's your favorite...

509
00:37:17,364 --> 00:37:19,698
tres leches from that place
that Brenda likes.

510
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,002
- Mmm.
- How is it?

511
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:25,003
Mmm.

512
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,145
Hey, so, listen,
I know you've had it rough,

513
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:34,081
all right, but you don't
have to worry anymore.

514
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:36,518
Okay, what's mine is yours.

515
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,522
I know you feel weird about me
giving you the house, but...

516
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,063
Come here.

517
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:20,741
<i>Gobernadora.</i>

518
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,479
You don't have to say it,
General, I know.

519
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,483
Teresa's gone.

520
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:30,919
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:36,391
You know, your devotion...

522
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,559
to me...

523
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:41,397
it's not about power

524
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,899
or about money.

525
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:45,970
I know that now.

526
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,741
You have become... family.

527
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,013
I really hope that's true.

528
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:56,281
Please...

529
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:58,286
sit.

530
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:06,861
Pozole.

531
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:09,129
I don't cook often,

532
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:11,669
but that happens to be
one of my specialties.

533
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,384
You have become
a very good friend

534
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,319
to me, Alberto.

535
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:31,390
Maybe we can be more.

536
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:34,627
I mean, I'm still mourning,
and...

537
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,396
I need to
take things slow,

538
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:38,231
if that's okay by you.

539
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,334
Of course.

540
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,303
I'll follow your lead.

541
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:37,434
