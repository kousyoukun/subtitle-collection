1
00:00:00,585 --> 00:00:02,975
<i>Previously
on</i> Queen of the South...

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:04,254
What is this?

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,624
These are the
ownership documents

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,782
filed in the Cayman Islands
for Camila's trawler company.

5
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:10,121
I never signed these papers.

6
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:11,762
Camila's trying to set
you up to take the fall

7
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:13,010
for her business.

8
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,452
We may have lost our supply.
Someone gave up El Santo.

9
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:17,477
<i>We have a rat.</i>

10
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:19,620
<i>They put a tracker
in Guero's necklace.</i>

11
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:21,845
<i>Basically what they did
is cast a copy of the medal,</i>

12
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:24,133
<i>inserting a tiny TTL device.</i>

13
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:25,764
- Can we use this?
- To track someone?

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,939
Absolutely.

15
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,310
- Found the mole.
- I can't believe this.

16
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:31,915
But you had no problem
suspecting me.

17
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:35,319
Now, how much dinero
is it gonna cost me for me

18
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,320
and my amigo...

19
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:39,445
<i>Have we heard
from George?</i>

20
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:40,392
<i>He's been off grid.</i>

21
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,561
<i>I just can't get
ahold of him.</i>

22
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:42,996
<i>We need to find him.</i>

23
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:43,997
There's Oleg.

24
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,833
Congratulations, Teresa.

25
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,505
I see bright things
in your future.

26
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:00,987
I'll be in Phoenix shortly.

27
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:02,623
<i>Call me
when you get here.</i>

28
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,307
<i>Thank you
for meeting with me.</i>

29
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,646
To be honest, I wasn't thrilled
to get your call, Teresa.

30
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:21,949
Last time I saw you,
you burned your relationship

31
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:26,055
with Rocco in Malta and in turn
threw a lit match on mine.

32
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:27,490
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:29,392
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

34
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:31,963
I'm hoping you care
more about the opportunity

35
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:33,197
I have for you.

36
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:35,001
Continue.

37
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:39,239
I've taken control of the
Phoenix corridor in Arizona.

38
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:42,310
I have a distribution
system on the dark web.

39
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,380
Rocco has Malta.

40
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,053
But there's an entire
world without him.

41
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,790
I think we can help each other.

42
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,096
There's only one problem.

43
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:58,499
My supplier's gone
off the grid.

44
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,069
I won't share my connections
with you, Teresa.

45
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:02,170
Not after Malta.

46
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,774
Good luck.

47
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:20,929
<i>The meeting with
Oleg didn't go well.</i>

48
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,899
There may be
another option.

49
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,135
I'm meeting Camila now.

50
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,444
James.

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,749
Nice to see you again.

52
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:42,862
I miss having you by my side.

53
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,633
Does Teresa know?

54
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,839
She sent me to hear you out.

55
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,543
Mm.

56
00:02:58,517 --> 00:03:03,453
Whenever you're down,
you always come back stronger.

57
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,257
This isn't the time
to give up, Teresita.

58
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:09,195
El Santo
is either dead or missing.

59
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,799
There's no business
without product.

60
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,005
You know where
we could get some.

61
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:17,439
No.

62
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:20,978
James said that
Camila can help us.

63
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:22,113
Camila is dangerous.

64
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,848
Yes, she is.

65
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:26,185
But you're safer with
her under your nose.

66
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:31,058
Just listen
to what she has to offer.

67
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:32,663
But like you said...

68
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:38,736
You might as well
go home and quit.

69
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:41,472
And I know that's not what
you want in your heart.

70
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:45,044
Because you are
a survivor, Teresita.

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,980
You never stop fighting.

72
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:49,984
Don't stop now.

73
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,592
<i>I'm here for a truce.</i>

74
00:03:57,297 --> 00:03:59,030
Did you tell Teresa I could
provide a supplier?

75
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:02,401
Yes, but the chances
of a sit down are slim to none.

76
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,404
Teresa's
business has stalled.

77
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
She needs my connection.

78
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,742
You know
I can help her.

79
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:11,680
Yeah, but she's not
gonna want your help.

80
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:13,951
I know.
But she needs it.

81
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,456
And I certainly need hers.

82
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,263
It's the only way
to save my daughter.

83
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:31,708
It's her.

84
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:35,145
<i>What's her offer?</i>

85
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:38,583
<i>She's asking
for a sit-down.</i>

86
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,052
What do you want me to do?

87
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,325
I'll meet with her.

88
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:48,163
Take her to the safe house
close to the border.

89
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,565
<i>All right.</i>

90
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,987
You know I can't guarantee
your protection.

91
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:08,424
I've run
out of options.

92
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,262
So if I'm gonna meet
my executioner...

93
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,167
So be it.

94
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:20,440
So if Camila comes
through with the supply,

95
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:22,043
what then?

96
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:24,813
You gonna kill her?

97
00:05:55,453 --> 00:06:00,453
Subtitles by explosiveskull

98
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,025
I know El Santo is out.
I know you need a supplier.

99
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,929
I can set up an introduction
with the Colombians.

100
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,367
What do you want in return?

101
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,106
I want you to kill Cortez.

102
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,709
I came to you because
I know you despise him

103
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,545
as much as I do.

104
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,482
Cortez convinced my daughter
that I ordered the execution

105
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,986
of her fiancé.

106
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:28,487
I did not.

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,394
And now he has her,
and I have to save her.

108
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,333
My governorship
is over.

109
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,608
I can set up a meeting
with Reynaldo.

110
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,778
And you can get
your business back on track.

111
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,119
Do you want
the introduction or not?

112
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:55,791
You understand what will happen
to you if this is a trap?

113
00:06:58,798 --> 00:06:59,830
You'll kill me.

114
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:05,605
And bury me
in a hole somewhere.

115
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:08,108
And never think of me again.

116
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,181
I was running
for my life.

117
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:15,018
And I'm standing in front of
the person that wants me dead

118
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,454
more than anyone.

119
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,891
The only thing that
matters to me now...

120
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:24,531
Is my daughter.

121
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,008
Take her.

122
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:42,422
I always thought
Camila's home was a little bit

123
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,361
over the top with
all the hard stone.

124
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:50,200
Governor's Mansion seems
to suit you, General.

125
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,003
Reynaldo is ready
to resume business with you...

126
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,875
Running Mexico.

127
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,112
- Welcome news.
- Hmm.

128
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:02,716
Truth is, he's in no condition
to put up much of a fight.

129
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:06,288
He had a health scare,
so he's traveling to the U.S.

130
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,758
to see a heart specialist
as we speak.

131
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:12,466
Perhaps it is your time
to take the reins.

132
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,402
It's inevitable.

133
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:18,438
And I'm a patient woman.

134
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:21,641
Now excuse me, General,
but I have a plane to catch.

135
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:25,313
It's always good
to see you.

136
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,419
It's always my pleasure.
Have a safe trip, huh?

137
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:30,220
Mm.
Take care.

138
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:55,655
General?

139
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,393
General, que pasa?

140
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,487
Is this still your brand?

141
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,191
Yeah.

142
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,701
Gracias, Pote.

143
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:39,748
I learned the rules of
the cartel from Epifanio.

144
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:42,752
I know you were
owed for his life.

145
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:46,091
You killed the man
that Teresa loved.

146
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,226
You collected your payment.

147
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:52,366
And you still kept coming.

148
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:54,169
Now you're
the one who owes.

149
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,542
I see that you and James have
been doing a lot of the killing

150
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:02,213
for Teresa.
The entire Comisión.

151
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:05,350
Impressive.
It's interesting, though.

152
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:10,457
She never approved of violence
when she was working for me.

153
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,627
She's la jefa now.

154
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:16,632
And she will do what she
has to protect her people

155
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,234
and her business.

156
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,403
Mm.

157
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,042
Must be eating away at her.

158
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,779
To become what she
hated the most.

159
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,081
And what's that?

160
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,620
Me.

161
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:34,657
She's nothing like you.

162
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:37,894
You don't even deserve
to speak her name.

163
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,101
I know more about running
a cartel than she ever will.

164
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,306
And you know that.

165
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,020
Or I will shut it
for you for good.

166
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,528
You're welcome to try.

167
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:10,473
Now get comfortable
in your new mansion.

168
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:26,897
Hey.

169
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,467
I understand not wanting
to do the deal with Camila.

170
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:33,537
But the offer is good.

171
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,707
Reynaldo Fieto is loyal
to the Vargas family,

172
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:39,812
so if she vouches for you,
you have a supplier again.

173
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:43,050
You ask me,
Camila owes you this.

174
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:45,688
You've built this business up
through sheer determination.

175
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:47,892
This move is a building
block for your future.

176
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,599
Let's make the deal
with Reynaldo,

177
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,736
then move on to Cortez.

178
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:58,874
The rest we'll figure
out afterwards.

179
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:04,714
I'm not gonna be
there for the rest.

180
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:07,883
I can't work
for someone who keeps

181
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,187
questioning my loyalty.

182
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:12,457
Not after all
we've been through.

183
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,101
I'm gonna help you
take out Cortez,

184
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:23,271
make sure you're secure,
but then I'm out.

185
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,516
James.

186
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:11,900
Someone in this room
was brave enough to attack me.

187
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:17,073
But who is brave enough
to confess?

188
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:27,387
Who put poison
in my wine?

189
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,390
Who would do this to me?

190
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:32,228
Hmm?

191
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:36,367
Not only am I
physically wounded,

192
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:40,372
but my heart breaks
from this betrayal.

193
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:48,717
When the body is wounded,
the wound festers.

194
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,789
What's rotten
must be hacked away!

195
00:13:56,062 --> 00:14:02,536
Emperor Claudius was poisoned
by his wife, Agrippina.

196
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,774
A single dose in
his evening meal.

197
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:14,956
Is my little chef
a student of history?

198
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:20,827
Oh, no.

199
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:31,390
I want my security doubled.

200
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:38,066
Move out to our new
headquarters immediately.

201
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,346
<i>Satellite
pharmacy, 713.</i>

202
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:52,122
<i>Satellite pharmacy, 713.</i>

203
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,526
Reynaldo.

204
00:15:57,562 --> 00:16:00,096
- Camila.
- How are you, my friend?

205
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,733
The doctors tell me
that if I take my pills,

206
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,704
I'll live another 20 years.

207
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,110
My very ambitious niece would
love me to retire tomorrow.

208
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,411
Does Castel know
you're meeting with us?

209
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:13,381
No.

210
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,151
I wanted to hear the terms of
the deal before I pass anything

211
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:18,555
along to her.

212
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,128
May I introduce Teresa Mendoza.

213
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:23,998
Nice to meet you.

214
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:30,170
I was very surprised when
Camila asked me to see you.

215
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,741
I'm not in the habit
of doing business with

216
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:35,611
the enemies of my friends.

217
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,446
You killed Epifanio.

218
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,917
And now you expect me
to work with you.

219
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:43,290
Even Camila knows I had no
choice but to defend myself.

220
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,359
Cortez is your enemy.

221
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:48,464
You need a new partner
in Mexico.

222
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:51,169
That's true.

223
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,637
The past is buried, Reynaldo.

224
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:56,106
Camila.

225
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:57,808
I promise you.

226
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:01,012
I underestimated Teresa
in more than one occasion.

227
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,883
She will
take out Cortez.

228
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,688
And this will be a good
partnership for you.

229
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,368
When I heard that malparido
Cortez had turned against her,

230
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,838
I wanted to cut off
his cojones.

231
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:27,248
I will work with you, but only
if you defeat the General.

232
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:34,058
And there is one
more condition.

233
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:42,001
He'll give us product.

234
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:44,538
What are the terms?

235
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:46,241
Camila can't be harmed.

236
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:50,914
What did you tell him?

237
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,885
I agreed.

238
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,724
You okay with that?

239
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,064
I know Teresa told you
she'll keep me safe.

240
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,136
But what happened between us
was very personal.

241
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,642
I don't think she'll keep
her promise to you.

242
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:15,614
You know me, Reynaldo.

243
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,152
I won't go down without
a very bloody fight.

244
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,487
The last time I spoke
with King George,

245
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,791
he was in Mexico.
Did you kill him?

246
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,795
No, he's still alive.

247
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:52,264
He's being held under
a different name

248
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,666
in a mental institution.

249
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:56,102
Only Cortez and I know
the location.

250
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,172
Give the location to Pote.

251
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,676
We need George's
weapons to take down Cortez.

252
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:02,211
We'll get him out.

253
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:04,480
I delivered my part
of the arrangement.

254
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,517
I want to go now.

255
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:09,187
I agreed
I wouldn't harm you.

256
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,123
I didn't say I'd give
you your freedom.

257
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,983
Hey.

258
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:33,020
Hey, there's been chatter on
the wire about General Cortez.

259
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,855
<i>He's left
the Governor's Mansion.</i>

260
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,158
<i>And there's been reports that
a military caravan</i>

261
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:39,428
<i>is heading north
out of Culiacán.</i>

262
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,530
<i>He's holding up with dozens
of his best soldiers</i>

263
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:42,866
<i>and stockpiles of weapons.</i>

264
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:44,869
<i>He knows Camila's out there.</i>

265
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,272
<i>He's expecting an attack.</i>

266
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:50,176
<i>He'll be putting up massive
defenses securing entry points</i>

267
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:54,115
<i>around the perimeter,
hardening his forces.</i>

268
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,752
<i>He's got every possible
resource at his disposal.</i>

269
00:19:56,788 --> 00:20:00,024
<i>If we make a move,
he'll be ready.</i>

270
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,558
It'll be close to impossible.

271
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:03,594
If we do this, we need
more men and an arsenal.

272
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,900
Camila knows where
George is being held.

273
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,768
We need to rescue him.

274
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:10,737
Then get his weapons.

275
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:13,141
<i>He keeps caches
of weapons all through Mexico</i>

276
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:16,578
<i>like the ones he brought
to Taza's reservation.</i>

277
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:20,550
You're right.
We need more men and guns.

278
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:24,457
That's why we contacted
Javier Jimenez, Boaz's cousin.

279
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:26,159
I know that guy.
He's a clown.

280
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:27,827
Yeah?

281
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:30,165
He's the leader of the
Death Squad out of Juarez.

282
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,567
<i>He's crazy.</i>

283
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:34,637
<i>But he's one of the toughest
cabrones I know.</i>

284
00:20:57,804 --> 00:21:00,605
Javier, welcome.

285
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,608
I'm Teresa.

286
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,047
You're more beautiful
than people say.

287
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:09,785
Had to be something very
special for this cabron

288
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,053
to leave Camila.

289
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,223
Show some respect, cabron.

290
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:15,459
That was respect.

291
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:17,027
Ask James.

292
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:18,797
He knows
I tell it like it is.

293
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,235
In between all the bullshit.

294
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,072
Is Boaz coming?

295
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,340
No.

296
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:29,845
He's not coming out of hiding
until he knows this is no

297
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:31,581
bullshit setup.

298
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:35,019
We have Camila.
She's being held inside.

299
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:40,360
Hey.

300
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,871
You believe Camila didn't
order Kique's death?

301
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,412
I believe Cortez killed
Kique to get to Camila.

302
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:05,928
Does Boaz still have men?

303
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,635
A few dozen.

304
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:12,703
We started a small
operation in Nogales.

305
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:15,208
Just across the border.

306
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:17,877
We need your help
to get our smuggler out

307
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:19,746
of a Mexican hospital.

308
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:24,119
He'll provide us with guns
to take Cortez down.

309
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:27,224
I'd love to feed Cortez
his own tongue.

310
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:31,095
But Boaz is going
to need something

311
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:33,666
more than just revenge.

312
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:36,303
What does he want?

313
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,242
To be in business with you.

314
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:43,813
We can discuss that.

315
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:48,989
We can work together
and take down Cortez.

316
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:55,268
James has
the information on Cortez.

317
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:56,936
Good.

318
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:58,772
Did he tell you he's leaving?

319
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:02,046
No.
It doesn't surprise me.

320
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,817
I made a mistake.

321
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,388
I want him to stay.

322
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,026
Did you tell him that?

323
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:21,870
Hey.

324
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:25,776
So, Pote and I will meet Boaz
and you will meet Javier

325
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:28,012
and his men near the hospital.

326
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:30,349
Using that guy is a risk.

327
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:32,921
You can't go into Mexico
without backup.

328
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:36,691
You're the boss.

329
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:42,699
You helped
build this business.

330
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:44,368
You shouldn't walk
away from it.

331
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:48,907
I want you to run Phoenix.

332
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,047
Is that just a business offer?

333
00:23:58,757 --> 00:23:59,922
I don't wanna lose you.

334
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,669
I just need a little time
to think about it.

335
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:11,771
Yes, of course.

336
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:15,010
Be careful in Mexico, okay?

337
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:18,214
Yeah, you too.

338
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,230
You sure we
can trust Boaz?

339
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:55,831
I'm not sure about anything.

340
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:58,639
But he's already
sent Javier to help us.

341
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,784
Teresa Mendoza.

342
00:25:10,354 --> 00:25:12,355
Thank you for meeting me.

343
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:14,123
It only makes sense.

344
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,326
It's not like I got people
lining up to work with me.

345
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:21,166
Got a small heroin business
and a bounty on my head.

346
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:22,868
So do you.

347
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,804
Javier told me
about your meeting.

348
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,710
El hijo de puta Cortez
has to pay for what he did

349
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:29,978
to my Kique.

350
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,149
I'm sorry for your loss.

351
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:36,020
That boy was my heart.

352
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,431
If you get payback for me,
I'm all yours.

353
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,214
I have to take this.
Excuse me.

354
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:59,687
Thank you.

355
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,425
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

356
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,429
Yeah, I'm with Javier.
We're en route to the hospital.

357
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,433
- How many men are with you?
- <i>Half a dozen.</i>

358
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:12,437
I'll let you know when we're
ready to move on George.

359
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,108
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

360
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:28,592
After we take out Cortez,
you'll run Sinaloa.

361
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,629
I would like you to share any
major decisions with James.

362
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:32,897
We'll work together.

363
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:37,270
You can count on that,
Teresa Mendoza.

364
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:44,980
To la jefa.

365
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:47,951
- Salut.
- Salut.

366
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:10,582
Shall we celebrate?

367
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:18,427
To the one person
in the world I can trust.

368
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:46,965
Isabela.

369
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:50,838
I love you as if you were
my own flesh and blood.

370
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:55,711
My mother is dead to me.

371
00:27:57,182 --> 00:27:58,849
You're my only family now.

372
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,907
Are your guys
ready to go?

373
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:19,610
They'll be guarding
the perimeter.

374
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:22,046
All of this to rescue
a smuggler?

375
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:24,517
I've got 20 different smugglers
you could choose from.

376
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:26,185
Not like this one.

377
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,387
Let's go.

378
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:05,739
Bilal, where's George?
Bilal, where's George?

379
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:07,742
Hey!
Something's wrong with him.

380
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:22,662
Those are Cortez's soldiers.

381
00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:24,799
Cover me.

382
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:53,237
My gun's jammed.

383
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,139
You're fine.
We're almost out.

384
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:15,902
Come on.

385
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:45,442
You have him?

386
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:47,111
<i>George wasn't there.
Bilal was shot.</i>

387
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:50,315
<i>He might not make it.
It was an ambush.</i>

388
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,920
<i>Camila set us up.</i>

389
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:01,160
Did you see their faces?

390
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:03,665
<i>Like rats in a flood.</i>

391
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,634
I thought Camila might go for
the smuggler to help her

392
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,970
escape the country.

393
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:11,339
So I put a contingency
in place.

394
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:15,779
But I'm not certain how Teresa
Mendoza found the location.

395
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:17,782
Camila must have
given it to her.

396
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:20,218
They are bitter enemies.

397
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:22,789
Their alliance
is highly unlikely.

398
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,559
Unless Camila has something
to offer that means more

399
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:27,695
to Teresa than vengeance.

400
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:29,297
El Santo.

401
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,736
- <i>She lost her supply.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

402
00:31:32,772 --> 00:31:36,741
Would your uncle make a deal
like this behind your back

403
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:39,812
<i>to give Teresa product
to save Camila's life?</i>

404
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:41,648
He's always been
very fond of her.

405
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,316
It's possible.

406
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:46,587
Please excuse me.
I have another call.

407
00:31:46,623 --> 00:31:48,590
<i>I'll keep you apprised
of anything new.</i>

408
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:50,026
Please do, General.

409
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:56,734
Bueno.

410
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,437
<i>Hey, puto.</i>

411
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:03,376
Boaz.

412
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:05,280
I sent you a link.

413
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:16,262
We're coming for you, cabron.

414
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,412
Those men who attacked
us were soldiers... military.

415
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,716
Those pendejos knew
we were coming.

416
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:33,417
Are you sure George
wasn't there?

417
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,488
Yeah.
Camila gave you the location?

418
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:38,625
Yeah.

419
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:40,494
Can we still get at Cortez?

420
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:44,066
It's harder now.
Se cabron knows we're coming.

421
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:45,401
He's right.

422
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:47,470
The guy will be building
up his security.

423
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:49,640
And we don't even
know where he is.

424
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,012
Call Taza and tell him we need
his men at the swing gate.

425
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:56,116
- We getting a shipment?
- No, not yet.

426
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:58,786
I'm gonna see what I can figure
out about Cortez's location.

427
00:32:58,822 --> 00:32:59,921
Okay.

428
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:08,032
Se cabron saved my ass
at the hospital.

429
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:12,638
You have a good soldier.

430
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:13,873
I know.

431
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:26,891
I'm very sorry, Your Majesty.

432
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:28,894
I had planned on putting
your suffering

433
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,330
to an end this evening.

434
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,065
But apparently there's
been a breach

435
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:34,037
at your former accommodations.

436
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,208
Did any
of my men get to you?

437
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:41,845
I know not everyone
can be trusted.

438
00:33:46,254 --> 00:33:48,520
Someone made contact with you,
huh?

439
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,898
Ah.

440
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,705
Tell me.

441
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:04,776
Come on.

442
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:08,180
You have been in solitary
too long, huh?

443
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:09,950
This caused
you to stop using

444
00:34:09,986 --> 00:34:12,253
your famously
wicked tongue, huh?

445
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,558
We'll see what else
you're good for.

446
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:24,473
You lied about
George's location.

447
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:28,776
George wasn't there?

448
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:30,911
They must
have moved him.

449
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,450
I didn't set you up, Teresa.

450
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:38,922
If there was a trap,
it was meant for me.

451
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,758
Not you.

452
00:34:40,794 --> 00:34:44,163
- Trust me.
- I don't.

453
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,732
Of course you don't.

454
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,910
You believe I betrayed
you in Dallas.

455
00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:56,113
I did not.

456
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,350
My attorney sent
the paperwork to frame you.

457
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:03,923
When the time came, I couldn't
bring myself to hurt you.

458
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,292
And that's the truth.

459
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:09,998
I did not turn on you.

460
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:13,770
I had grown quite fond of you.

461
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:18,143
I always believed
you were special.

462
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:21,681
Different.

463
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,784
You just assumed
the worst of me.

464
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:30,893
And you left me no choice
but to send James after you

465
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,963
to protect my business.

466
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:36,134
Just as you're
protecting yours now.

467
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,174
But regardless,
we need to trust each other.

468
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,877
Out of necessity.

469
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:46,081
Where did Cortez move George?

470
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:49,085
I dunno.

471
00:35:51,224 --> 00:35:52,756
We lost the element
of surprise.

472
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,826
We need to get it back.
Give me your phone.

473
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,333
Bueno.

474
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:02,403
<i>It's Teresa.</i>

475
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:07,577
<i>You have something I want,
and I have something you want.</i>

476
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:08,615
Let's make a deal.

477
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:56,162
<i>Hola, Teresa.</i>

478
00:37:56,198 --> 00:37:58,332
<i>My apologies for not being
there in person.</i>

479
00:37:58,368 --> 00:38:01,002
<i>It seemed like
a needless risk.</i>

480
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:04,774
<i>Shall we discuss your terms?</i>

481
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,778
We both get our supply
from the Colombians.

482
00:38:07,814 --> 00:38:11,718
You run Sinaloa,
and we keep the peace.

483
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:15,855
I find those terms amenable.

484
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:19,594
<i>I look forward
to a fruitful partnership.</i>

485
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,397
Where's George?

486
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,733
<i>My men
will assist you.</i>

487
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:49,000
Now, what about my prize?

Reynaldo's condition is that
Camila can't be harmed.

489
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:17,306
If anything
happens to her,

490
00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:19,309
we both lose our supply.

491

<i>You have my word.</i>

497
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,395
He gonna do a lot worse
to her than he done to me.

498
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:25,733
She knew the risks.

499
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:39,117
<i>I'm excited for your return,
Camila.</i>

500
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:43,724
<i>Your days as
a fugitive are nearly done.</i>

501
