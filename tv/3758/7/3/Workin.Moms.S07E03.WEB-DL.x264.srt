1
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:41,940
Sloane, are you
wearing Mom's perfume?

2
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:43,898
I just wanted to smell nice.

3
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:45,752
She just died.

4
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,391
You can't wear that
around Papa right now.

5
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:50,127
I'm gonna stay home
today to take care of him.

6
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:52,336
But who's gonna
take me to school?

7
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,136
Figure it out.

8
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,021
I got this.

9
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,453
Wait!

10
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,403
Please don't leave us, Mommy!

11
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:13,579
How shall I ever
carry on without you?

12
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,140
Not funny.

13
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:16,965
You forgot to say goodbye, so...

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,754
Right, okay.

15
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,687
Well, bye, baby.

16
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:24,014
Mommy has to go to work because
you're a little distraction.

17
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,839
Are you good?

18
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:28,360
You want us to maybe pay
you a little lunch visit?

19
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:30,285
No! Nah, I'm slammed today.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,308
Bringing you food is kind
of the thing I'm known for.

21
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:34,178
Are you sure you don't want
a little visit from baby?

22
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:35,231
Of course.

23
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:36,669
Kids don't really need
their moms that bad.

24
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:39,085
I haven't seen my mom since
I was eight and I'm fine.

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,030
Alright. Um...

26
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,735
How about I just
send you some updates

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,800
throughout the day, then, huh?

28
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:45,705
Yes, that'd be great.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,906
Are you sure this is
how you want to spend

30
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:49,097
your vacation days?

31
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,259
I actually can't think
of a better way to spend

32
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,664
my vacation than just chilling
out with this little dude.

33
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,618
Okay, well, try to teach
him something useful today,

34
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,710
would you? PAUL: No
way, we're on vacation!

35
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,170
- Thank you.
- No problem.

36
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:02,147
Okay, bye.

37
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,493
Okay...

38
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,736
And action!

39
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,830
Hey honey, have you heard of
this male birth control pill?

40
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:23,384
I've heard of it.
But what's the point?

41
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:24,409
You're already on the pill.

42
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,733
Well, what if I don't
want to be on it anymore?

43
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,019
D-Denise?

44
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,554
That... that's your cue, honey.

45
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,289
What, me? Yeah.

46
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,619
Oh, sorry!

47
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:41,545
Oh, it's okay. The
line is, "You don't have to.

48
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:43,708
"That's why we at Fronterra
created Seedless."

49
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:45,328
Just like we
rehearsed it, okay?

50
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:46,478
Got it.
Let's try it again.

51
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:47,629
Sorry, I'm
just so excited!

52
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:49,094
We are too.
We're all excited!

53
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,847
Okay.
Alright, and action!

54
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,078
Take it away!

55
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:54,009
You don't have to.

56
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,954
That's why we here at
Fronterra created Seedless.

57
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:57,643
So... Uh...

58
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,105
Was that not good?

59
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,329
Well, it was, uh...

60
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,247
- It was a little
quiet. - Oh!

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,094
- Maybe just a little
louder. - Yeah, of course.

62
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,730
They need someone who's
gonna command the space.

63
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,194
Right.
Let 'em hear it.

64
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,588
You don't have to!

65
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:11,781
That's why we here at
Fronterra created Seedless!

66
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,319
Did it?

67
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:22,060
Hey, Doc. You,
uh... got a minute?

68
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,452
Hey, Seamus,
right? - Yeah.

69
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,618
Um, yeah, you know... I do.

70
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,443
I have a little window.

71
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:29,468
Come on in.

72
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:34,405
I really didn't think you
would take me up on my offer.

73
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,430
I struck a little
deal with my parents.

74
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,356
I get out of anger management,

75
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,666
as long as I sign
up for therapy.

76
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,427
Figured it might as
well be with you.

77
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,586
We vibe. Don't you think?

78
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,421
Yeah.

79
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:50,882
Yeah, I do think, yeah.

80
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,495
Um...

81
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,721
I actually did donuts
in my car the other day,

82
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:57,501
just to see what it was like.

83
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,259
Wow. Yeah.

84
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:00,906
What'd you think?

85
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,068
I kinda loved it.

86
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:04,869
Way more than I expected to.

87
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:05,516
Right?

88
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,675
It's just... It was
incredible just to...

89
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,948
give in.

90
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:10,759
To that pull.

91
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,544
Yeah, the pull. Yeah,
that's it exactly!

92
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,456
Hey...

93
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,500
You, uh... you wanna
try something else?

94
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,713
Um...

95
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,499
I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

96
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,668
You were right. I
skimmed your book.

97
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,660
That was unacceptable.

98
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,706
But, look, baby's at home.

99
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,348
You have my full attention.

100
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:39,031
I'm listening.

101
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:41,987
I spent the morning
familiarizing myself

102
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,511
with "Tasking."

103
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:46,304
I gotta say, it spoke to me.

104
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,481
Okay.

105
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:52,716
Sorry, so when you say

106
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,854
that there is no such thing
as multitasking, are...

107
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,736
Sorry, just one sec.

108
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:00,561
Let me guess, text about baby?

109
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:03,120
Uh, yes, I did ask
for regular updates

110
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:04,739
throughout the day, so...

111
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,098
Yeah, you sure it was
my book you just read?

112
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,990
'Cause I don't think
you're getting it.

113
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:12,016
I mean, you're saying it,
but you're not doing it.

114
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,075
Can I ask you something?

115
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,681
Why didn't you take
maternity leave?

116
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,730
Because I don't need it!

117
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,466
I've got it under control.

118
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,557
From what I'm seeing, you don't.

119
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:25,129
But you could.

120
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:26,851
That's "Tasking."

121
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,733
Focus on one task at a time,

122
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:31,786
put everything into that,
and you'll be surprised

123
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,123
at how much more
productive you are.

124
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:34,847
That is your recipe for success.

125
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:37,272
I mean, I left the
baby at home, didn't I?

126
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:39,998
Physically, but mentally,
baby's still right here with you

127
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,240
and slowing you down.

128
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,432
But realistically,
I am still a mother.

129
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:46,757
Not within these four
walls, you're not.

130
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,147
Hey!

131
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,511
Sorry to interrupt, Dairy
Queen, but it's milk o'clock!

132
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,403
Case in point.

133
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:54,301
I still have to pump
every three hours.

134
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:55,692
Maybe you don't.

135
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,539
You can train your body to
go for longer stretches.

136
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:59,630
Your body works for you.

137
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,568
Isn't that a little extreme?

138
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:03,959
I get it.

139
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:06,751
And I never say in the
book that it's easy.

140
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,748
But if you want to compete
with your male counterparts,

141
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,937
then this is what
you've gotta do.

142
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:15,362
What I can tell you is
that this approach works.

143
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,951
Okay, you know what, Colin?

144
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,927
Maybe later.

145
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,113
But... it's been hours.

146
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:24,381
Go!

147
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,683
Alright.

148
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,549
Impressive!

149
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,273
Why don't we start again?

150
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:38,797
Seedless.

151
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,752
Now, that's an easy
pill to swallow.

152
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,361
Huh...

153
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:44,972
Okay, it's alright.

154
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:46,649
Let's just pick up the
energy a little bit, right?

155
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:47,984
Okay.
This one, you know what?

156
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:48,754
Let's keep it loose.

157
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,630
Let's just see you loosen
your body up a little bit.

158
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,020
There she is, there she is.

159
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,165
This one, say it like a
person would say it, you know?

160
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,316
Like you're talking to your
neighbour, nice and loose.

161
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:01,166
Seedless.
It's an easy pill to swallow.

162
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,457
Like you're an authority.

163
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,515
Like you're the authority,
like you're a scientist.

164
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,419
Seedless! That's
an easy pill to swallow!

165
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:07,900
How about a warmer...
Warmer, like...

166
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:08,925
Seedless...

167
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,503
Now, that's an easy
pill to swallow?

168
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:11,673
No, maybe just a
statement. Just...

169
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,075
Okay. Seedless!

170
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,402
Seedless! Seedless!

171
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:17,025
You're a police officer speaking
to another police officer.

172
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,282
Okay. Seedless...

173
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:19,587
Like you're talking
to the queen.

174
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:20,675
Seed-lace...

175
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,446
Like you're giving a tour
of your lab to somebody.

176
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,854
Seedless. That's an easy...

177
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,398
Oh.

178
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:47,607
Door's open,
we're comin' in!

179
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,298
Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!

180
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,536
Crystal had a breakdown
and ran away to Tibet!

181
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:52,226
What?!

182
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,708
Yeah, we know it sounds crazy,

183
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,331
but we looked it up
and it's a real place.

184
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:57,731
Okay, boys, you know what,

185
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,613
as fathers, this is on you.

186
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:00,638
My boys need me.

187
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:01,716
Val, no.

188
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,074
We've been up all night!

189
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,474
Jackie won't take a bottle.
We've tried every kind of milk.

190
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:06,731
Every kind of milk!

191
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:09,329
Almond milk, oat milk, two
percent, table cream...

192
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,005
We even tried chocolate milk.

193
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,065
Yeah.
She won't drink that.

194
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,274
It's like she's
addicted to the nip!

195
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:15,193
Yeah.
Listen up, boys,

196
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,918
some people take weeks
to get their baby

197
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,506
to take formula from a bottle.

198
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,964
But not me.

199
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,755
I'm the baby whisperer.

200
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,360
Val Szalinsky can get any baby
to transfer from boob to bottle,

201
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,118
or your money
back! Right, Mel?

202
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:29,677
Uh, I suppose that's true.

203
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:31,735
Come here, peanut.

204
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,693
Watch the master work, hm?

205
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,532
Bottle? Bottle.

206
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:39,803
Here we go.

207
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,358
Why isn't she drinking?!

208
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:47,882
Take a hike!

209
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,440
Let the master work.

210
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:50,737
Okay, yeah! Thank you!

211
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,479
Thank you!

212
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,053
- Is there anything...
- You too, Melon!

213
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:57,208
Uh, uh... not take
a hike, but...

214
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,404
You know I love you,
but take a hike.

215
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,584
Ah...

216
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,286
Holy shit!

217
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,954
Right?!

218
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,512
Oh, how's that for a pull?

219
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,303
Oh my God,
it felt like the...

220
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,166
plane was gonna land
on my fucking face!

221
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,191
- God, that feels amazing.
- Ah, yeah, it does!

222
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,563
Wow...

223
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:26,121
The adrenaline just
like melts away

224
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:28,746
all the stress and the trauma.

225
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,354
And like, yeah.

226
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,079
It's like...

227
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,671
it's just about giving
up control, you know?

228
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:37,677
You, uh, you kinda strike me
as someone who likes control.

229
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:39,051
Me?

230
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:42,360
Nah, no way.

231
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:45,941
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

232
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:47,792
What? Already?

233
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,388
Couple more take-offs?

234
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:51,246
No, sorry, Doc, I gotta
go meet my girlfriend.

235
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,403
Girlfriend?

236
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,662
Oh, wow, you never
mentioned a girlfriend.

237
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,253
Well, you never asked.

238
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,630
You take her to airport tarmacs?

239
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,755
No, not yet.

240
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,313
Yeah, we actually
just started dating.

241
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:05,206
Oh, is it serious,
or just like a fling?

242
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,464
I dunno. We're kinda just...

243
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,120
figuring it out.

244
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:12,213
You know, we're taking
things slow, actually.

245
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,932
I'm kind of into it, you know?

246
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:15,390
It's like that...

247
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,908
it's like that rush.

248
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,239
You know, like the
thrill of the chase.

249
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,386
What thrills you?

250
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:29,146
Oh my God,
there's another one!

251
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:33,140
Woo!

252
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,932
Despite a little,
uh... hiccup,

253
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:37,836
Maggie's back on board and
things are looking good

254
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,255
with contract negotiations,

255
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,999
so thank you, Sloane,
for salvaging that.

256
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:43,487
This is exciting.

257
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,129
She has a loyal fanbase
from her speaking events

258
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:48,354
that we hope to leverage
into the literary market.

259
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,346
Uh...

260
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,357
Sloane, did you
want to hit pause?

261
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:54,782
Take a little break?

262
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,766
Nope. No, all good.

263
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,090
All good.

264
00:10:58,177 --> 00:10:59,343
Uh, you sure?

265
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,467
Do I not sound sure?

266
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,845
You sound sure to me.

267
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,003
No, I just, um...

268
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,294
Then why would we hit pause?

269
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,199
You were right in the
middle of a riveting recap

270
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:07,111
of things we already knew!

271
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:09,741
You're leaking.

272
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:14,519
What's the problem, you thirsty?

273
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,510
I am training my body.

274
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:20,334
Um, alright.

275
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,405
I might ruin a couple
shirts in the meantime,

276
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,895
but hey, what are you gonna do?

277
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,486
Let her dry cleaner
worry about that!

278
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,216
I'm just trying to
avoid an HR situation.

279
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:29,386
What would
you tell them,

280
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,801
you were hoping to
make a White Russian

281
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,659
but Sloane was
hogging all the milk?

282
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,410
Unless any of
you want some extra cream

283
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:40,237
in your coffee, can we
get back to work, please?

284
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,656
Uh... okay.

285
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:47,262
Okay, well, we're thinking of
a Wynston-backed speaking tour,

286
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:49,187
bigger venues than she's
ever been to before...

287
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,963
Seedless.
Now, that's an...

288
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,176
easy pill to swallow.

289
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,601
I think we
should just call it.

290
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,059
Admit defeat and start over.

291
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,618
Okay, I heard that.
I'm sorry, but this is insane!

292
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:59,971
Why do I have to
convince anyone?

293
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:01,396
I don't have to tell you, Ram!

294
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,951
This pill speaks for itself!

295
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,309
Okay, maybe we just take a beat.

296
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,668
No! I don't want
to take a beat!

297
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,992
I'm sorry, okay?

298
00:12:08,017 --> 00:12:10,785
I get it, I'm not a great
actress or whatever.

299
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,277
I'm a scientist!
I'm a scientist.

300
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:15,012
I do science-y things.

301
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,312
Ha, it's a joke, all this!

302
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,004
All this showy stuff, what,
so I can convince people

303
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:21,895
that a good product
is a good product?

304
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,353
I don't get it!

305
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:24,944
And how does that make you feel?

306
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:25,802
Crazy!

307
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,293
Kate, this makes me feel crazy!

308
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,663
Yeah, I bet it does.

309
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:31,755
How so? Tell me specifically.

310
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,781
I don't get
what the hard sell is.

311
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:37,014
I mean, there's no
headaches or migraines.

312
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,031
There's no blood clotting. No
risk of high blood pressure.

313
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:44,725
It is way less of a burden
than what women put up with!

314
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,043
What else, Denise?

315
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,678
This is not a
controversial take.

316
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,504
This is just levelling
the playing field.

317
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,711
Push in slowly, please.

318
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,554
Why wouldn't
we give people options?

319
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,226
This product will improve lives.

320
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:59,375
Women have been shouldering
this responsibility for years.

321
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,306
Let men pick up
some of the slack.

322
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,741
Take the damn bottle.

323
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:25,109
It's gotta be better
than Crystal's nipple!

324
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,921
Cleaner, that's for sure.

325
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,641
How old's your little one?

326
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,988
Oh...

327
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,631
Brand-new.

328
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,973
Basically still wet.

329
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:36,964
That can be a tricky time.

330
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,889
I'm so sorry.

331
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:42,649
Not to presume, but I had
trouble with my supply,

332
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:46,075
so breastfeeding was off the
menu for us pretty quickly.

333
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:48,820
But when my baby
wouldn't take the bottle,

334
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:52,420
I found my nipples to still
be a very soothing pacifier.

335
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,611
Have you tried that?

336
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:55,369
I...

337
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,060
have not.

338
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,545
It really does the trick!

339
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,170
Just a little soothe, and
she'll take that bottle.

340
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:04,996
No harm in trying!

341
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:06,064
Don't be shy.

342
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:20,003
Just a little soothe.

343
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:22,141
No harm in trying.

344
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,072
There it is.

345
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:29,695
There it is!

346
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:37,432
Wow, you don't have any
supply trouble after all!

347
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,737
She's drinking.
She's drinking.

348
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,018
How long has it been?

349
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,424
Eighteen years.

350
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:51,609
Oh my God, okay.

351
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,131
You can do this, Lionel.

352
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,789
You can do this. Just
a little snack...

353
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,347
to tide you over.

354
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:57,704
Uh...

355
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:59,022
Oy...

356
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,865
Oh, ew...

357
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,256
Ew, ew...

358
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:03,942
Oh, no...

359
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,767
Oh, God!

360
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,458
Eugh!

361
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,516
Nasty!

362
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:10,948
Oh, hey...

363
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:13,206
my little ray of sunshine!

364
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,691
How was your day?

365
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,098
Oh...

366
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,681
Honey, you're scaring me.

367
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,234
Mmm...

368
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Oh!

369
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,855
But it's only Tuesday!

370
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,527
Mmm!

371
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,401
Yeah...

372
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,943
Yeah, I'm feeling a
little crazy myself.

373
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:40,851
Slow it down, big boy.

374
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,840
Right...

375
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,364
Yeah.

376
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,955
- Throw things into
neutral. - Mm-hm.

377
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,339
Okay.

378
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,688
What...

379
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,457
Shhh!

380
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:55,415
It's about taking things slow.

381
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:57,132
- Mm-hm?
- And then...

382
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,103
And then...?

383
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,428
Then the rush will happen.

384
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:02,111
Yes!

385
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:10,394
I'm not feeling the rush.

386
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,633
I'm not either. I'm
not feeling anything.

387
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:12,860
Yeah.

388
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,142
- Just forget
it. - Yeah.

389
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,366
- Just, eugh.
- Okay.

390
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,113
Oh... sh...

391
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:31,104
Tula?

392
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:35,629
I'm a scientist.
Uh-uh, no, no, no, no.

393
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,375
I am a scientist!

394
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,664
You know how I know
I'm a scientist?

395
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:39,574
Because of my glasses!

396
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,677
Now, are those prescription?

397
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,722
Absolutely.

398
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,178
You know what, Denise,
I just want to thank you

399
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,697
for today, because
you worked so hard.

400
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:47,098
Well, I'm incredible.

401
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:50,358
Whose fucking nuts idea was
it to put her on camera?

402
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:53,336
Yeah, but honestly, though,
you were incredible today.

403
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:55,428
I... I really don't know
how you pulled that off.

404
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:56,652
Oh, it was nothing, come on.

405
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:57,910
No, it's not nothing.

406
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,403
You are a triple threat
in a body-con dress.

407
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:02,530
Sorry, "body-con"?
How do you know that?

408
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,111
My wife loves a body-con.

409
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:05,418
Your wife?

410
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:06,988
Yeah, I mean, she's great.

411
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,754
She, uh, she says
I work too much,

412
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,326
which to that I say, "Uh,
do you like nice things?"

413
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,147
Sounds like Nathan.

414
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:15,510
Nathan, is that, uh, your fella?

415
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,801
"Fella"?

416
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:17,826
Sorry, how old are you?

417
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,110
I heard that when I said it.

418
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,269
Uh-huh.

419
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:22,981
Okay, here we go.

420
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:24,971
Oh, boy. Another!

421
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:26,364
To a job well done.

422
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,254
To a couple of scientists.

423
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,388
Woo!

424
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,695
Another round, me' lady?

425
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,805
No, I shouldn't, I shouldn't.

426
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,504
What, have
you got surgery in the morning?

427
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:36,720
Aw'rite, another round!

428
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,139
The lady demands it!

429
00:17:38,164 --> 00:17:40,084
The lady says so!

430
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,602
Oh, hello there!

431
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:53,594
- Popcorn?
- Oh, sure.

432
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,173
I dunno what it is,

433
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:57,064
but I've been craving
salt like crazy.

434
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:00,116
Mmm, well, that's the Seedless.

435
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:03,286
Your body is probably
just adjusting.

436
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:04,657
Mmm.

437
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,283
Should we, uh...

438
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,007
should we take it
for a test drive?

439
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,255
Mmm, mm-hm.

440
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:14,386
Mmm...

441
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,211
Mmm...

442
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,805
Are you...

443
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,630
are you crying?

444
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,121
It's, uh, allergies.

445
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:32,880
Oh. Okay.

446
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,713
Seriously, are you okay?

447
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,705
Mmm, no!

448
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,251
I'm sorry, I'm
just so emotional.

449
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,501
I'm sorry. Let's keep going.

450
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:51,793
Okay. Yeah, just...

451
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,088
it's just hard for me
when you're crying,

452
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,130
you know what I mean? NATHAN:
Yeah, jeez, I'm sorry.

453
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:56,554
Let's, um, let's
try something else.

454
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:58,439
- Okay, yeah.
- Let's mix it up.

455
00:18:58,464 --> 00:18:59,303
- Yeah.
- Okay, yeah.

456
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:00,796
Let's mix it up, right?

457
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:02,822
It's fun. Mmm...

458
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,370
Let's get this shirt off.

459
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,362
Oh, you know what,
I'd rather keep it on.

460
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,440
Hey, just relax.

461
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:11,435
You're totally hot.
You're so beautiful to me.

462
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,584
I'm fat!

463
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:13,638
You're not fat!

464
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:15,196
You're the skinniest
boy in the world.

465
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,566
- Like a broom.
- I am not.

466
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,376
- Like a broom, but sexy.
- And I'm breaking out.

467
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,525
Hey, uh-uh, you're flawless.

468
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,776
You're glowing, baby.

469
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,073
Yeah, uh-huh.

470
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,033
I'm so bloated!

471
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,783
Baby, I'm bloated
every time we have sex.

472
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:28,852
Every single time.

473
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,143
You're so mean to me.

474
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,880
- No, uh-uh, you're
just... -

475
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,537
Alright, okay,
just let it out.

476
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:35,556
Just let it out.

477
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:38,439
Can we order some ramen?

478
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:39,831
Huh? Yeah, alright.

479
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:40,945
Okay.

480
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:46,284
Hey, babe.
How was your...

481
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,471
day? Oh...

482
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:53,885
I don't wanna talk about it.

483
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,177
I'm leaving work at work.

484
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,628
I'm home now.

485
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,386
Did you get the
updates I sent you?

486
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:01,109
I did, yeah.

487
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,021
Um, just thinking about it...

488
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:05,713
Maybe pull back on sending
me all that baby stuff

489
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,040
while I'm at work.

490
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,259
Unless it's an emergency.

491
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:11,196
Okay.

492
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:12,416
Are you sure?

493
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,679
It just makes it harder.

494
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:17,802
Anyway, where is my
little Tonka truck?

495
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,283
I need a squish!

496
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:21,374
Sorry, babe. You
just missed him.

497
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:22,598
He's down for the night.

498
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:23,874
Oh.

499
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:26,357
We missed you today.

500
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:29,654
Hey, check it out.

501
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,916
Baby's first bubble beard!

502
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:34,590
I texted it to ya.

503
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:36,261
I love that.

504
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,549
Anyway, I should probably go
pump if he's not gonna nurse...

505
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,783
before I explode.
