1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:05,037
Okay, Jenny!
You excited for

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,306
"Take your perfect little
daughter to work" day?

3
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:11,043
- Totally!
- That's my girl!

4
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,713
You finally get to see
Mommy be a big boss!

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,416
How many kids in
your class can say that?

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,018
Fine... fine...

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,120
Barf. Also barf...

8
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:24,656
And this doesn't look
like electric green to me.

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,658
I think they were sort
of trying to go with...

10
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,005
Jenny, what colour
would you call this?

11
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:28,627
Booger green.

12
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,730
Exactly!

13
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:36,235
We want electric
green, not booger green,

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,071
not this grody,
two-seasons-ago green.

15
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,475
Don't waste my
time until it's perfect.

16
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,684
You'll see when you're running
the show one day, baby girl.

17
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,687
You've got two choices:

18
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,491
you can spare
people's feelings, or...

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,660
you can actually
get what you want.

20
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:16,075
Okay, Zoe, you ready
to visit your Lola?

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,676
That makes one of us.

22
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,725
The fuck?

23
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,505
I am so sorry
about all the crying last night.

24
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,529
That pill.

25
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,397
But I think it was kind
of cathartic, you know?

26
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,731
I don't care.

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,602
Look at this!

28
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,505
Wow, you really want me to
stop taking birth control, huh?

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,408
They're Nathan Jr's. Did
he buy a lifetime supply?

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,411
What are you doing?

31
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,990
Trying to find some room
in here for your lunch.

32
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,614
But with all these, um...

33
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,816
these condoms...

34
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,219
I guess you're done
with your vow of celibacy?

35
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,953
Unless...

36
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,300
unless you're
jerking off into them.

37
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,023
Why would I do that?

38
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,526
Just a lot of reasons, right?

39
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,206
I mean, sanitation, sensitivity
training, science project?

40
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,163
What kind of science project?!

41
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,964
Yeah, what kind of
science project, Kate?

42
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,334
Huh, well, you know,
you do your thing,

43
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,436
and then you freeze
it, and then, you know...

44
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,748
Cumsicle? NATHAN
JR: Please stop.

45
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,572
Wh... what's happening?

46
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,441
I'm just trying to be open

47
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:23,543
to an open relationship.

48
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,244
Oh!

49
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,146
All the condoms
are for different...

50
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,181
That makes more sense.

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,760
I don't know why I
went right to "cumsicles."

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,185
Yeah.

53
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,232
But how open are you?
Because this is a gigantic box.

54
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,189
The regular amount of open!

55
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,957
Whatever Julian wants.

56
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,658
Is that what you want?

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,960
Yes!

58
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,763
I also want to be done
with this conversation, so...

59
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,565
Don't forget these.

60
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,044
Not that you could
forget 'em. So many.

61
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,569
Bye!

62
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,272
Oh my God, that just went
about as bad as it could go.

63
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,784
That was just really,
really, really bad.

64
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,409
I mean, it wasn't great, but...

65
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,478
I'm picking him up
after school today.

66
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,179
Yeah...
I'm gonna let him drive.

67
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,214
Oh, God.

68
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,383
Give him the wheel,
and then I'll talk to him.

69
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,163
I really... I really don't
think you should do that.

70
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,587
Just promise me
you won't talk about

71
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,087
jerking off into condoms, okay?

72
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,021
I won't. Kate...

73
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,291
I got this.

74
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,970
Ugh, I can't find
Tula anywhere in the house!

75
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,195
Of course you can't.

76
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,074
She's probably crawling
around in the walls by now.

77
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:18,997
Is this supposed to
make me feel better?

78
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,233
Because it's not.

79
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,180
Okay, you know this fear
that you're feeling right now?

80
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,764
What if you thought
of it as excitement?

81
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,206
You want me to be excited,

82
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,908
yeah, that a giant
hairy spider could just...

83
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,643
could just be anywhere?

84
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,789
What if she's in the cabinet?!

85
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,213
Oh, God!

86
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,814
Wasn't that a rush?

87
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,317
I'm gonna shit my pants, Anne!

88
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,029
What if she's crawling around
in our coffee mugs right now?

89
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,853
God! I'm hating
every moment of this!

90
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,032
Why are you doing this to me?

91
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,723
So you feel the pull.

92
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,425
What pull? What is
going on with you?

93
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,327
I feel great. Better than ever.

94
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,028
Are you sure?

95
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,308
Because this seems
like the opposite

96
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,064
of getting back to normal.

97
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,611
Do you think maybe
we should, you know,

98
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,467
check in with the brain doctor?

99
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,135
Ugh!

100
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,638
Okay, thanks for
your concern, Dad.

101
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:00,839
I'm going to work.

102
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,241
Don't wait up.

103
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:10,449
Oh...

104
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,683
Did she, like...

105
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,287
say how long she'd be?

106
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:18,657
Hey, gimme a zit check.

107
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,492
Breath check.

108
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,961
Hair check.

109
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,696
Perfect.

110
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,465
Who let in the riffraff?

111
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,569
Mom!

112
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,371
Hi, Lola! I missed you!

113
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,473
Princess Zoe!

114
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,576
Look how big you've gotten!

115
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,711
I guess two years will do that.

116
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,980
Hi, Mom. Nice to see you too.

117
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,286
Why don't we get you a mint?

118
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,926
Oh, hey!

119
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,296
So, have you heard any
feedback on the Seedless ad?

120
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,931
Uh, no, not yet. But I
have a call with Ram,

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,178
I mean, you know, Fronterra,
later this afternoon, so...

122
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,380
Pretty big risk, guiding
Denise off script like that.

123
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,537
I know I could never...

124
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,517
Anything else,
Rosie? - Actually, yes.

125
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,585
Our 11 am is in the
boardroom. New client!

126
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,942
This is news to me.

127
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,289
Do we not have a shared
calendar for this exact reason?

128
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,546
That's correct, we do not.

129
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,992
It wouldn't have helped us
anyway; they just showed up.

130
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:16,615
I didn't think I could say no.

131
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,317
Why not?

132
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,822
No, absolutely not!

133
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,502
Whatever you two are
pitching, I'm already out.

134
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,125
Rosie, what were you thinking?

135
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,538
Forrest and Juniper
are not clients.

136
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,829
They're clown people!

137
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,941
Well, he's Richard's
son! I didn't know what to do!

138
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,365
Watch this. No!

139
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,434
Kate, baby. Please.

140
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,035
How do you two
even know each other?

141
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,437
You introduced us.

142
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,640
Pretty sure in, like, this room.

143
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:42,574
You're like our mom!

144
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,042
Our hot mom.

145
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,244
Thank you, Juniper.

146
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,824
We just need,
like, five of your minutes.

147
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,650
It would mean so much to us.

148
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,053
You have four left.

149
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:59,157
Prepare to get your minds blown.

150
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,160
What the fuck is that?

151
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,363
- "Just Head!"
- It's "Just Head!"

152
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,997
The ultimate in
female satisfaction.

153
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,166
You mean...

154
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,369
It makes you
cum! - Relentlessly.

155
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,581
Okay, I can't believe I
have a follow-up question,

156
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,971
but why is it a zombie?

157
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,673
I stole it from work.

158
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,274
I work at a year-round
haunted house.

159
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,976
That tracks.

160
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,356
And although there
are many ghouls,

161
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,612
it gets very lonely.

162
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,481
So I got creative.

163
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,015
You sure did.

164
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,817
That's where I come in.

165
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,786
There's a head,
but the head is dead.

166
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,181
So how do you make
the tongue move?

167
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,424
Motor tongue!

168
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,991
Motor tongue.

169
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,194
Is it getting closer to us?

170
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,397
Yeah.

171
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,632
Keep in mind this
is an early prototype.

172
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,301
We're not venture
capitalists, you know that.

173
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:47,105
We need your help creating
buzz to attract investors.

174
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,508
Yes, because if the people talk,

175
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,042
the money talks.

176
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:51,810
That does make sense, actually.

177
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,645
No, mm-mm.

178
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,312
I'm sure that you
have a lot of questions.

179
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,847
Not one.

180
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,993
Like, can you put your dong in...

181
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:57,649
No questions.

182
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,650
Yes!

183
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,218
Yes.

184
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,252
Hey! Oh, God.

185
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,654
I knew it.

186
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,657
I told you not to force Forrest.

187
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,859
I want you to go home, I
want you to take that obscene

188
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,861
sex rig with you. Go on.

189
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,829
Dad, we're not done.

190
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,533
I don't care.

191
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,245
You want me to sit in on
that Fronterra call later?

192
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,470
Uh, no. It, uh...

193
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,116
It's just, you know, Ram
and I, and we got it, so...

194
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,676
Mm-hm? Yeah.

195
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,945
Thank God.

196
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,447
Where were we?

197
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,682
Rosie, wrap this shit up.

198
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,485
It can't possibly make you
cum like they say, right?

199
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,831
I don't care if it
makes you levitate!

200
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,956
Shut it down.

201
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,258
I mean, there'd have to
be, like, multiple speeds...

202
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,494
Write that down.

203
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,768
I like what you've
done with the place.

204
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,270
You win the Super
Bowl or something?

205
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,706
That ring was a gift,

206
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:58,109
for 30 years of
service at my company.

207
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,978
That's what they do, you know.

208
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,180
Reward you for
putting in hard work.

209
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,917
Mm, cool. Congrats.

210
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,186
I don't know what
it is about you.

211
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,088
It's like you're allergic
to making me proud.

212
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,123
Okay, let's get this over with.

213
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,292
I need your help with money.

214
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,994
It's not for me, it's for Zoe.

215
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:16,995
I will pay you back.

216
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,497
Mostly.

217
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,499
Why?

218
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,601
I've already set you up.

219
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,803
I gave you every opportunity
and you fumbled it.

220
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,606
You have no idea the
shit I had to put up with.

221
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,942
I have been through
a lot too, okay?

222
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,311
You have it easy.

223
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,814
I was the only
woman on the board,

224
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:36,615
Totally, Mom.

225
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,416
Poor you!

226
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,351
Here we go again,
can't wait to hear about

227
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,154
being a business woman
in the booming '80s.

228
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,423
I don't remember you complaining

229
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,960
when you had ponies at
your birthday parties, Jennifer.

230
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,566
You like brisket?

231
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,967
What?

232
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,570
We just got a smoker.

233
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,139
You might as
well stay for lunch.

234
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,649
Hey, have you ever
laid on an airport tarmac

235
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,161
and screamed while
planes flew fly by overhead?

236
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,952
Not loving the sound of that.

237
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,107
I went with the new patient.

238
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,555
He just...

239
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,389
gets it, you know?

240
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,191
That rush I've been chasing.

241
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,660
Uh-oh... Is this spider 2.0?

242
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,595
I dunno!

243
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,741
There's something
exciting about this kid.

244
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,999
Kind of sexy, even.

245
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,002
You just said "sexy" and
"kid" in the same breath.

246
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,605
I mean like
the situation is sexy!

247
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,552
And besides, he's 18.
Eighteen's not that bad, right?

248
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,576
That's a pervert's
motto, my friend!

249
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,011
No, it's... it's like
an emotional thing!

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,558
Oh, okay, you're having
an emotional affair...

251
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,615
with a teenage boy.

252
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,818
No...

253
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,568
I thought only I made
you snort-laugh like that!

254
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,791
Who are you texting?

255
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,225
Oh, it's no one. Ram.

256
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,094
I mean, Fronterra.

257
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,296
Just a new client.
It's a boring client.

258
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,876
Yeah, you're grinning,
but you're saying "boring."

259
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,400
I should say "exciting" client.

260
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,180
They're actually launching
the first male birth control pill.

261
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,644
Nathan's trying
it, to mixed results.

262
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,085
Does he know about the
man behind the birth control pill

263
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,709
who's making his
wife snort-laugh?

264
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,311
Well, no, but, you know...

265
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,312
he doesn't know the
name of all my clients.

266
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,414
Hmm.

267
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,094
It hasn't come up! If
it did, I would tell him.

268
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:18,817
I would just tell him.

269
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,852
Okay.

270
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,821
How did this become about me?

271
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,233
Does Lionel know
about your jailbait crush?

272
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,124
Shut up, no. I know, okay?

273
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,226
I'm... I'll stop.

274
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,460
Stop being his therapist?

275
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,731
No...?

276
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,110
I'll stop the field trips.
No more funny business.

277
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,867
You too, with this Ram guy.

278
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,335
Yeah, of course.
No funny business.

279
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:41,139
No funny business.

280
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,943
Fuck this, I'm gettin' a scone.

281
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,222
Yeah, what constitutes
"funny business"?

282
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,246
This question.

283
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,250
You should eat up.

284
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,085
Who knows where your
next meal is coming from?

285
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,656
You need water. Barb!

286
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,357
No, it's okay. I got it.

287
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,493
Let Barb do her job.

288
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,663
You focus on getting
your own job, Jennifer.

289
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,668
You know what?

290
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,507
I have to use the bathroom.

291
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,401
Oh, Jenny.

292
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,904
What? Oh, no... I was...

293
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,619
You keep finding new
ways to disappoint me,

294
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,607
I'll give you that.

295
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,109
Whatever.

296
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,812
I'm disappointing, okay?

297
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,413
I've always been disappointing.

298
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,916
I'll always be disappointing.

299
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,920
I guess I'm just one big
fat disappointing loser!

300
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,354
C'mon, Zo! Let's go home!

301
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,123
Go on.

302
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,559
See you next time
you need something!

303
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:13,765
Oh!

304
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,234
What's the good word, guvnah?

305
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,114
Hi, this is Ram Javeri
of Fronterra Pharmaceuticals.

306
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,637
Uh, uh...

307
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,973
Uh, yes, Ram. How are you?

308
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,319
I'm bloody fuckin' wif' ya!

309
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,044
Pip-pip! KATE:

310
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,445
Right-o!

311
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,580
The Beatles music...

312
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,184
Uh, Here Comes the Sun.

313
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,986
Anyway, uh, talk to
me. How did we do?

314
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,255
Oh, we did very good.

315
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,057
The commercial's tracking great.

316
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,792
And judging by
the sales uptick...

317
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,793
it was a huge success.

318
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,661
Yes!

319
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,263
I think you might be brilliant.

320
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,665
Oh, come on! Just doin' my job.

321
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,768
Yeah, let's just hope
that the fame doesn't go

322
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,447
- to Denise's head, right?
- Yeah, no kidding.

323
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,271
I just had the best
head of my life!

324
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,474
I'm gonna have to call you back.

325
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,076
This is a place of
business, Rosie.

326
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,778
What the fuck?

327
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,980
This is gonna
sound a little nuts,

328
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,659
but I took the Head on
the teensiest spin at lunch.

329
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,083
Forget levitating.

330
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,284
It'll make you soar!

331
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,386
How?!

332
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,221
Well, the seats recline
pretty far back, so...

333
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,667
No, I mean, how did
you get yourself to...

334
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,291
Look at it!

335
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,426
The key is to cement
your eyes shut

336
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,695
and let the demon do
what he was designed to do.

337
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,075
I mean, women have done
stranger things to get off.

338
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,799
Have they?

339
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,211
I think if you tried
it, you'd realize

340
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,435
it's worth considering.

341
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,704
This thing could fill a real
gap in the sex toy market.

342
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,384
If you love it so much,
you run with it, okay?

343
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,707
Just leave me out of it.

344
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,810
No, no, no, no, no.

345
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,222
Don't worry, I bleached
the shit out of it.

346
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,212
Fully sanitized.

347
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,014
Are you insane?

348
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,393
Trust me, gives
a whole new meaning

349
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,616
to the "Monster Mash."

350
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,024
Alright, Doc, where
we goin' today?

351
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,226
Y'know, I've been
eyeing this old...

352
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,438
You know, why don't we
put a pin in the field trips,

353
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,662
and just... try talking?

354
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,065
Ooh, all business today, I see.

355
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,867
Yep, all business.

356
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,635
No funny business.
No other kinds of...

357
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,471
all businesses that there are.

358
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,941
Why don't you tell me
about your parents?

359
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,843
I dunno.

360
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,544
There's...

361
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,946
not much to say.

362
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,948
Um, what about your goals?

363
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,450
Your future?

364
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,552
Oh, come on. I don't
wanna talk about that.

365
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,254
What do you want to talk about?

366
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,056
Oh, these days?

367
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,258
My girl, mostly.

368
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,460
How about school?
How... what do you...

369
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,964
Yeah, she's just like,
all I can think about.

370
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,243
Guess we're talking
about her, okay.

371
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,100
It's the waiting.

372
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,902
You know, it's killing
me, but it is so hot.

373
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,570
You know, like that...

374
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,505
like that rush of desire?

375
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,706
Mm-hm, yeah.

376
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,475
Um...

377
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,910
Do you wanna...

378
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,379
tell me more about that?

379
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,092
You know how it is
when you're with someone new

380
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,683
and you just...

381
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,086
you just want
them, like, so bad?

382
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,389
Mm-hm.

383
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,893
I mean, yeah, I remember
that feeling, sure.

384
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:58,897
Her hair just
smells so fucking good.

385
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,599
And her lips...

386
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,336
God, her lips drive me crazy.

387
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,005
I just want to taste
every part of her.

388
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,742
What a waste of fucking time!

389
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,146
So stupid.

390
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,915
Mama?

391
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,617
Look.

392
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,997
Did... did you take
that from Lola?

393
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,623
Mm-hm!

394
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,827
Do you have any idea
how valuable this is?

395
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,163
Maybe we should go find out.

396
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,943
So...

397
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,177
about this morning...

398
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,046
No, thank you.

399
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,181
I just... I think you
jumped into this whole

400
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,527
open relationship
thing awfully quick,

401
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,552
and it's a big step.

402
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,787
Good luck.

403
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,990
Why... why isn't it working?

404
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,193
I turned on the "teen driver."

405
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,362
There's too many things
to pay attention to, okay?

406
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,864
You cannot be trusted
with loud music right now.

407
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,477
So I guess we'll just talk
about your sex life, huh?

408
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,667
Yay.

409
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,070
Come on!

410
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,582
I'm just trying to make sure
you're as open as Julian is.

411
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,373
Like...

412
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,175
is he wide open
and you're just ajar?

413
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,610
Is it more of a
saloon door situation

414
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,257
where you're open today and
then you swing shut tomorrow?

415
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,680
Like, are you guys
equally as open?

416
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,615
Okay, I don't think you get it.

417
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,986
We're not some basic
old sexually repressed

418
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,087
straight couple like you.

419
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,889
Wha... Excuse me!

420
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,691
First of all, I'm very young.

421
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,353
Let me put it this way, then.

422
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,895
Maybe this isn't
about my sex life.

423
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,898
Maybe you're just jealous
because I have one,

424
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:41,832
and you and Dad don't!

425
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,035
What?

426
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,204
Let's just get home already.

427
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,511
Why is it yelling at me now?

428
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,913
Because we don't like it
when you drive that fast.

429
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,315
Who is "we"?

430
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,450
Oh, just this sick ride

431
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,021
and your sexually
repressed stepmom!

432
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,222
Unbelievable.

433
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,829
I do this smooth
move, like down and up,

434
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,831
and down and up.

435
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,467
She loves it!

436
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,096
I can tell she was
giving me the eyes...

437
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,538
Hey, Dad. Oh!

438
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,739
Hey, bud.

439
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,941
How's it go...

440
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,476
Everything okay?

441
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,877
Oh, yeah, yeah, fine.

442
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,046
Whatcha watching?

443
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,748
Oh, uh, it's...

444
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,251
it's "The Best Lay."

445
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,153
Twenty hot singles
live on a tropical island

446
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,355
and test-drive
each other's bodies

447
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,257
till they find their
ultimate sex mate.

448
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,292
How do you win?

449
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,892
How do you lose?

450
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,663
Okay, horndog, I see the appeal!

451
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,365
Okay... watch this.
This is the best part.

452
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,867
Oh, okay.

453
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,447
When contestants
vote each other into a Fuck Hut.

454
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,304
Shit.

455
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,750
Imagine we got
voted into a Fuck Hut.

456
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:55,973
What would we do?

457
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,275
Hm...

458
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,278
Mm.

459
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,894
Fuckin' hell, Nathan, are
we sexually repressed?

460
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,785
What? No, of course not.

461
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,920
No, no.

462
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,490
I've just got a killer headache

463
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,094
and I'm still not
feeling totally myself.

464
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,096
I'm sorry I'm still
not in the mood.

465
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,600
Like...

466
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,935
Look, I understand,
right, and I love you,

467
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,116
but the thing about birth
control is you just suck it up

468
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,938
and pretend you're not
experiencing the symptoms.

469
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,907
That's the deal!

470
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,510
Who's textin' ya?

471
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,145
Huh? Oh, um, just, uh...

472
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,014
Anne.

473
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:37,948
Oh yeah, how was your lunch?

474
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,017
Good.

475
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,921
Wanna watch the
rest of this with me?

476
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,124
Uh, you know, I
think I'm gonna...

477
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,326
head upstairs, but keep
me posted on this whole, uh,

478
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,161
Alright.

479
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,131
- Love you!
- It's your loss!

480
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,545
Who in the right
mind would ever...

481
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,247
Ever...

482
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,953
Oh!

483
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,761
How does this work? Okay.

484
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,365
Whoa...

485
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,567
Oh, that's a monster.

486
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,469
Oh, God...

487
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,772
Oh, fuck...

488
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,975
Whoa!

489
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,883
Ah...

490
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,084
Oh, yeah.

491
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,488
Oh, no.

492
00:19:56,596 --> 00:20:00,097
Hey honey, do we have
any chocolate pudding?

493
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Okay, this is a whole thing.

494
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,000
This is a whole thing
when you look at you.

495
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,636
Oh, yeah?

496
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,183
That's kind of part
of it, that's part of it.

497
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,507
Holy shit, that's part of it.

498
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,911
The chia seed
kind isn't cutting it!

499
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,413
I'm craving the sugary stuff!

500
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,248
Oh, you creep!

501
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,717
Oh, you fuckin' psycho!

502
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,420
The good chocolate
butterscotch swirl ones!

503
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,222
Why did we stop
buying those, anyways?

504
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,324
We can afford it.

505
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,459
I don't need the jumbo
size, a mini cup would do.

506
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,060
And I'd even get
the powdery stuff.

507
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,643
You know, the one
you put in the bowl

508
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,711
and you mix it with the water?

509
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,134
Kate?

510
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,357
Are you hearing any of this?

511
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,137
What the fuck?!

512
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,939
Ocupado!

513
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,319
- Jesus!
- Ah, God, I'm sorry!

514
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,875
God, what the hell is that?

515
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:45,876
Oh my God, how
do you turn it off?!

516
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,077
Turn it off, Kate!

517
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,246
Is it in the ears?!

518
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,080
Oh, no!

519
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,682
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

520
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,083
This has gone too far!

521
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,253
I am never gonna un-see this!

522
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,532
Why are you looking at
me? Look anywhere but me!

523
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,655
Just stop. Turn it off.

524
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,690
Why are you still here?!

525
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,237
- Make it stop.
- Turn it off!

526
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,895
Fuck you guys! Fuck you guys!

527
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,124
Fuck you guys! Fuck you guys!

528
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,266
I just wanted to feel nice!

529
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,325
