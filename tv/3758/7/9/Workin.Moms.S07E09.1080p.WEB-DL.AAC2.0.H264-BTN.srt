1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,468
Mm.

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,037
Ugh...

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,039
You call this a smoothie?

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,140
Viscosity's way off.

5
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:09,874
It's just juice.

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,643
Okay, alright.
Good note, good note.

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,478
I'll keep that in mind.
So, look...

8
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,647
Denise, you got my attention.

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,260
I didn't know what
to believe before,

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,950
but I'm listening now, okay?

11
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,852
And I'm sure you've signed

12
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,489
some kind of
non-disclosure agreement.

13
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,518
- So let's talk about smoothies.
- Oh!

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,261
Let's say Smoothie City
was releasing

15
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,663
a new lactose-free smoothie,
and you knew

16
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,699
that it was just filled
to the tits with dairy.

17
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,969
Where would I look to
find evidence of said dairy?

18
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,372
They'd have no reason
to do that.

19
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,052
Dairy alternatives
are big business.

20
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,553
I'm talking about
Horamo, Denise.

21
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,278
Horamo, the migraine medication.

22
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,633
I need to know what's going on
there, and why you left.

23
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,581
Oh, I didn't leave.

24
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:50,782
I was fired.

25
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,884
What?

26
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,585
- Mm.
- You were...

27
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,487
Kate,
I'm trying to figure out

28
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,167
what to get Julian
for his birthday, and...

29
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:57,922
Wait, you didn't
say anyone was here!

30
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,291
I should go.

31
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,493
No, please, please, please.

32
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,106
Just give me a minute, okay?
Thirty seconds, tops.

33
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,274
Thirty seconds!
Thirty seconds.

34
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,331
Hey, buddy, what's up?

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,710
Uh, okay, so this whole
open relationship thing

36
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,334
isn't really working for me.

37
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,903
But Julian's
birthday's coming up,

38
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,183
and I thought that would be a
good chance to get him something

39
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,806
that says "Happy Birthday"

40
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,808
as well as
"Please only be with me."

41
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,743
Okay, okay, a gift.

42
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,523
Uh, you know what?
Don't get him anything.

43
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,747
Why don't you, um,
uh, play your sax?

44
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,216
Are you sure?

45
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,918
I am positive, I am positive.

46
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:27,719
You go write something from the
heart, and it's gonna go great.

47
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,321
Oh!

48
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,922
Okay, he's gone.

49
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,557
No more distractions.

50
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,559
You said you were fired?
Why?

51
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,528
Ram knows
that I know

52
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,730
that he has friends
on regulatory boards,

53
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,032
and that's why Horamo's
being released so quickly.

54
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,175
Okay, well, it's actually
being delayed, okay?

55
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,137
Ram is putting it
back through R&D.

56
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,373
He's not delaying anything!

57
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,975
In fact, he's moving up
the release date on Horamo.

58
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,345
It's going to market early?

59
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,546
You didn't hear it from me.

60
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,658
Thank you both for coming in,

61
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,138
taking time out of
your busy schedules.

62
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,162
You're welcome.

63
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,663
Fucking Ram.

64
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,165
Where are you?

65
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,369
Hi, yes!
Uh, happy to be here, of course.

66
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,772
Well, I have good news!

67
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,476
You've both been selected
to organize the school fun fair!

68
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,010
I thought you said "good news."

69
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,679
I can't...?

70
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,881
Well, everyone
says that at first,

71
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,761
but you have been selected
for a very good reason.

72
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,985
Well, what reason?

73
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,688
Well, all parents
are expected to contribute

74
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,090
in some way, and so far
you two have contributed...

75
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,292
in no way.

76
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,427
Yeah.

77
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,607
And we pay a lot of money
to contribute in no way.

78
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,904
Woo?

79
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,006
Yoo-hoo!

80
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,040
Hm?

81
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,409
Hi.

82
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,411
Sorry.
Uh, work... stuff.

83
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,224
Yes, well,
you also have kid stuff,

84
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,592
considering how
bad things have gotten

85
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,115
between your two children.

86
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,828
- Zoe and Charlie?
- What's going on?

87
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,720
Oh my, they hate each other!

88
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,723
The tension between them
can be quite distracting.

89
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,659
So it wouldn't hurt if you two
could set a good example

90
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,128
and try to work together
harmoniously.

91
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,612
I'm sorry, but this is
bullshit, okay?

92
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,269
I'm in the thick of it at work.

93
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,048
I don't have time
to plan a fun fair.

94
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:26,938
And I know what you're
gonna say, but...

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,273
I'll do it.

96
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,619
What, you will?
Why?

97
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,276
Because I'm a good person?

98
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,745
Uh-huh...
What's the catch?

99
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,080
No catch.

100
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,428
I don't treat people like shit,
and I'm not a psycho.

101
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,685
And besides,
you can't, and I can.

102
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,554
I mean, I guess you do have

103
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,496
a little more time
on your hands right now.

104
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,491
If you're referring
to my employment status,

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,493
I'll have you know
I have an interview today.

106
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,872
It's with a great company
and I'm a great fit,

107
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,763
because I'm a great person!

108
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,765
Yeah, you mentioned that.

109
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,166
Alright, well, thank you.

110
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,067
And good luck!

111
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,469
Thanks.

112
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,903
Oh, look at them.

113
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,572
They're fine.

114
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,951
I mean, what is
she talking about?

115
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,875
Well, even if they weren't,

116
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,355
it's definitely not Zoe.
She's an angel baby.

117
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,279
So, maybe check on Charlie.

118
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,880
Will do.
Bye.

119
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,723
Hey, Alice.
It's me calling, again.

120
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,727
I'm just calling to check in
on you, see how you're doing.

121
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,097
Uh, call me back, please.

122
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,338
Fuck!

123
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,407
I hear that.

124
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,940
Hey.

125
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,808
What are you doing here?

126
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,143
You got time?

127
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,291
You know what, I've given
therapy to friends before,

128
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,035
and it... it doesn't
really work out.

129
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,149
Think of this
as therapy-adjacent.

130
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,619
A conversation between
like-minded ragey friends.

131
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,554
One just happens to
be a professional.

132
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,623
Okay, I am also busy.
I have appointments.

133
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,124
Clear your schedule.

134
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,826
You can't bribe me, Sloane.

135
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,429
I don't feel like
myself at work.

136
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,631
I don't feel like
myself at home.

137
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,132
My vagina's broken.

138
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,369
Different doctor for that.

139
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:08,172
Look, the point is,
I'm tasking as hard as I can.

140
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,343
At work, at home.

141
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,379
I'm tasking so hard, I'm losing
my goddamn mind, and I-I...

142
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,648
I need help.

143
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,250
Well, I...

144
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,953
I don't know what
"tasking" means, but, uh...

145
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,657
I do know about
not feeling like yourself.

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,861
The thing is, you lose yourself
the second you give birth.

147
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,341
Funny how nobody mentions
that little gem

148
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,964
prior to getting pregnant.

149
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,066
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

150
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,670
being a mother is so fulfilling
and so beautiful.

151
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,374
But kids will take and take
and take until they wear you out

152
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,153
and block your number
like you're a call centre

153
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,578
from a different...

154
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,790
Okay, I'm sorry, this doesn't
sound like my thing at all.

155
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,382
No, but it's your future.

156
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,061
And I thought you of all people
would want to know the truth.

157
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,185
I'm telling you,
you gotta be ready.

158
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,788
Because when that day comes...
And it is coming...

159
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,823
When your kid wants
nothing to do with you,

160
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,693
you gotta know
who you are without them.

161
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,895
Who were you before?

162
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,029
Who's...

163
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,498
old Sloane?

164
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,832
Pre-baby Sloane.

165
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,233
Get to know her again.

166
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,603
She's increasingly foggy.

167
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,643
I'm taking the day off.

168
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,848
You coming?

169
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,654
Right
this way, ladies.

170
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,123
Wow, the backroom!

171
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,225
You don't get out much, do ya?

172
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,228
What?
Who doesn't like a backroom?

173
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,531
You ready to walk a mile
in Old Sloane's shoes?

174
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,733
Yep, I didn't play hooky
for nothing!

175
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,835
Well, buckle up, bitch!

176
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,637
Okay.

177
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,520
You are moving up
the release date of Horamo?

178
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,944
Kate!

179
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,457
Kind of thing you might want
to discuss with your PR firm,

180
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,247
- don't ya think?
- Okay, Kate...

181
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,349
No, I came to you
with legitimate concerns

182
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,350
about Horamo, and you lied
about looking into it!

183
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,352
Okay, can I speak?

184
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,065
I'm feeling a little
attacked here.

185
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,634
Yeah, 'cause you're
under attack.

186
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,491
Who told you about the release?

187
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,670
I have a...
I have a source.

188
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,093
Was it Denise?

189
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,862
'Cause Denise can't be trusted.

190
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,274
Really, 'cause at
the moment it is you

191
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,865
who are not looking trustworthy.

192
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,365
Really?
Can I show you something?

193
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:15,266
No.

194
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,769
Yes.

195
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,549
There's your
trustworthy scientist,

196
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,950
caught selling
our formula for Seedless

197
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,674
to a foreign competitor.

198
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,876
No way.
She is not a criminal.

199
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,377
Maybe she's just, you know,

200
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,178
workin' late with
some colleagues.

201
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,915
Certainly aren't
colleagues of mine.

202
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,785
You know, I don't
even know that that's Denise.

203
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,887
No, that's her.
That is definitely her.

204
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,989
Look at her scratching.
She loves to scratch.

205
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,301
Clearly there were
some surveillance cameras

206
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,092
Denise did not know about.

207
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:41,893
Look, you're gonna
see she gets paid...

208
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,928
right there.

209
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,197
Shit, well, that
explains the psoriasis.

210
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,510
On top of that,
her work had become erratic.

211
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,534
She was unreliable.

212
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,680
So I guess you don't have
the regulatory boards

213
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,103
in your back pocket?

214
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,205
What, why would you think that?

215
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,541
Well, I mean, Horamo
was approved pretty quickly.

216
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,611
Because Horamo is ready.

217
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,890
Here's what R&D told me when
I took your concerns to them.

218
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,114
Okay.

219
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,316
So, pain and memory
are housed in the same part

220
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,396
of the brain, and Horamo
floods those pain receptors

221
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,554
with serotonin,
thereby reversing the effects

222
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,824
of a migraine,
when you have a migraine.

223
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,426
Now, if you take Horamo
when you don't have a migraine,

224
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,607
it's gonna go looking for pain,
and when it doesn't find any,

225
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,364
it's gonna attack
memory instead.

226
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,567
That's why you and your friends

227
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,313
experienced temporary
memory loss and elation.

228
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,571
We were elated...
yeah.

229
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,542
And this will all be noted
in the drug's documentation.

230
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,577
When you used to get migraines,

231
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,345
you said,
because of salt, right?

232
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,247
Oh, yeah.

233
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,760
Bowl of cured olives,
for instance, pssht!

234
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,151
It's like a mallet to my brain.

235
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,330
Okay, okay, so wouldn't you have
done anything at that time

236
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,186
to make it stop?

237
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,655
Well...

238
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,058
Okay, you don't believe me...

239
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,761
Believe these.

240
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,864
Testimonials, from the Horamo
trials, of migraine sufferers.

241
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,667
When people are in pain,
they just want to make it stop.

242
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,571
And Horamo does that
in 45 minutes, tops.

243
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,406
Kate, this is a miracle drug.

244
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,115
Think of all
the people we could help.

245
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,481
Mmm!

246
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,217
Mmm, my God,
this is so delicious.

247
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,264
I don't remember the last time
I took lunch for myself.

248
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,221
I don't remember
the last time I ate lunch

249
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,490
without being milked
like a prized cow.

250
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,426
I usually spend mine
arranging Jayme's playdates

251
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,229
and shoving week-old Rotisserie
chicken down my throat.

252
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,800
I should probably
pump after this.

253
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,680
Shit, I forgot to register
Jayme for gymnastics.

254
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:31,603
Fuck!

255
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,237
No!

256
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,239
No, we are not doing this.

257
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,009
You're right!
Rediscovering our old selves.

258
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:38,910
You wanna have some fun?

259
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,614
Yes!

260
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,514
Everything okay?

261
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,917
No, actually.

262
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,779
My deepest apologies,
Ms. Mitchell.

263
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,453
What seems to be the problem?

264
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,056
Neither of these meals
are any good.

265
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,903
So, why don't you take 'em back
to the kitchen and try again?

266
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,059
Right away.

267
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,028
So sorry, Ms. Mitchell.

268
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,731
Oh, uh...

269
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,910
What was wrong with them?

270
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,067
- Nothing.
- Really?

271
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,313
That guy was... he looked like
he was about to cry!

272
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,637
That's the whole point!

273
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,337
Old Sloane loved this shit!

274
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,239
Oh...

275
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,043
Yeah, I mean...
that... cool.

276
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,723
Yeah, it's not quite hitting
the same way that it used to.

277
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,448
No.

278
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,351
Okay, okay, apart from
terrorizing wait staff,

279
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,287
what made Old Sloane feel alive?

280
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,490
What's the craziest shit
you used to do?

281
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,492
You really wanna know?

282
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,100
Ladies!

283
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,501
Who's hungry?

284
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,770
Wait, Kate told me about this.

285
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,905
These aren't... are these...

286
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,676
Meatboys?
You're goddamn right they are.

287
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,478
Okay.

288
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,281
I'm also skilled at creating
and implementing systems.

289
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,761
I have experience
working with teams,

290
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,185
as well as leading projects.

291
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,122
And, as I always say, every
development team is only as good

292
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,468
as the donuts you bring in
for them on Monday!

293
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,973
Wait until the team
hears that one!

294
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,330
They're gonna love it.

295
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,700
Jenny, this has been great.
I think your positive energy

296
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,912
would be a valuable addition
to the team.

297
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,602
I get that a lot.

298
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,082
Well, thank you
again for coming in.

299
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,907
We'll be in touch!

300
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,742
Did I get it?

301
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:18,743
Get what?

302
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,312
The job.

303
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,492
Oh, um, well, we still have a
few more interviews to do, so...

304
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,894
Yeah, well, I saw
the competition out there...

305
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:25,750
I mean, yikes!

306
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,351
What do you mean?

307
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,954
You know, ugly, stupid, boring.

308
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,333
They look like they're gonna go
home to their lightsaber toys.

309
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,626
Oh, well...
They come highly recommended.

310
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,962
Are you gonna make me beg?

311
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,532
I was a manager.
I've done interviews.

312
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,145
You just have a gut feeling
about these things.

313
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,370
So, do I have the job or not?

314
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,172
Well, 30 seconds ago, you did.

315
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,241
But now... you don't.

316
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,843
This interview's over.

317
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:52,744
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

318
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,946
Fine!

319
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,548
I'm over-qualified
for this shit job anyway.

320
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,250
Also, your bangs are stupid!

321
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,788
Ooh!

322
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,257
You are so tense!

323
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,359
Yeah, I wonder why.

324
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,593
Take five.

325
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:14,398
Take five?

326
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,467
We're not doing anything wrong.

327
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,489
They're getting paid,
everyone's having fun!

328
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,782
Yeah, you're right.
No, totally.

329
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,472
Yeah, we're having fun.

330
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,373
Isn't that the whole
point of today?

331
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,374
Yes!
Right.

332
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,409
You're right.

333
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,812
And besides, you ever
do shots off a six-pack?

334
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,814
What?

335
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,383
You, here.
Care to share your abs with us?

336
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,597
Woo!

337
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,988
O-okay...

338
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,092
Ooh!

339
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,693
Sorry.

340
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,496
It's cold.

341
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,898
To Old Sloane!

342
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,300
To Old Sloane!

343
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,205
Alright!

344
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,211
Ah!

345
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,821
Are you having fun yet?

346
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,455
Aah!

347
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,026
Honestly...

348
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,128
not really.

349
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,031
I think I just want
to be with my kid.

350
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,834
Yeah, me too.

351
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,068
Let's get out of here.

352
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,236
Yeah.

353
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,072
No more zombies!

354
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,440
Look!

355
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,276
Oh, shit.

356
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,544
Is that...

357
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,445
Juniper?

358
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,447
Yup.

359
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,860
She and Forrest couldn't
decide who'd be the face

360
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,150
of their next prototype.

361
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,452
Guess she won the coin toss.

362
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,132
It was somehow less horrifying
when it was a zombie.

363
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,457
I dunno...
I think she's kinda cute!

364
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,870
Is there... is there
anything else, Rose, or...?

365
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,693
No.
Yes.

366
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,963
I was hoping to take
some vacation days.

367
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,342
You already maxed out
your vacation days for the year.

368
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,666
What are you talking about?

369
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,679
You took two weeks off
because your cat was depressed.

370
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:58,747
- Those were sick days!
- You were in Mexico!

371
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,771
And I got sick there.

372
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,974
People don't tell you
not to drink the water!

373
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,253
Literally the first thing
people say about Mexico is

374
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,277
"Do not drink the water."

375
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,512
Well, a bunch of my girlies
are going to Vegas

376
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,659
for Christina Miller's
bachelorette, #It'sMillerTime.

377
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,861
And I haven't technically
taken a vacation since...

378
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,085
You can go, okay?

379
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,098
But it will be unpaid, because
again, you've maxed out!

380
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:16,888
Well, what's even
the point of being partner?

381
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,789
This blows!

382
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,169
Sorry, Rose.
I don't know what to tell ya.

383
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,993
Well, don't apologize to me!

384
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,128
Why don't I call
Christina Miller right now

385
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,397
and you can explain to her
why her maid of honour

386
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,699
can't be there for her
last weekend as a free woman!

387
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,534
- Got a minute, boss?
- No.

388
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,281
It's just that my friend
Christina Miller's

389
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,338
- getting married...
- Do not start.

390
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,885
You still poring over
those Horamo testimonials?

391
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,541
How are you still on the fence?

392
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,288
I just... I want to be sure,
you know?

393
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,412
This is our reputation
on the line.

394
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,392
Not sure if you noticed,
but it says "Kate Foster PR"

395
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,015
on the door.
Imagine it said "Mo Daniels PR."

396
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:44,748
Oh, I do.

397
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,517
Every day.

398
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,097
Okay, well,
then you get it, right?

399
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,222
If they go down, we go down.

400
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,002
I dunno, I thought
reading these people's stories

401
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,959
would help, but...

402
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,188
I don't know what to believe.

403
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,562
Yeah, the way I see it,

404
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,742
when you're looking for
problems, you'll find problems.

405
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,344
Why don't you start
looking for a solution?

406
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,735
Very helpful.
Poetic, even.

407
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,715
You've got hundreds of
first-hand accounts here.

408
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,617
What else do you need
to convince yourself

409
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,818
that this pill needs
to be on the shelves?

410
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,579
What?
It's my cheat day.

411
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,808
Man, you're gonna be bloated
after all that salt.

412
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,682
Oh, no.

413
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,685
Oh, no.

414
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,820
Oh...

415
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,990
There she is!
Okay...

416
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:03,427
Where are the pills?
Where are the pills?

417
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,899
Okay...

418
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,037
Okay...

419
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,405
Here we...

420
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,656
Yeah!

421
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,059
Oh...

422
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,062
You look like you could
use some baby love.

423
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,091
There you go, little man.
Go to your mama.

424
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,641
Mmm...

425
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,676
Well, it's gettin' late.
I'm gonna head out.

426
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,483
Oh yeah,
I made you a bouillabaisse.

427
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,352
It's a little cold right now.

428
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,374
I wasn't sure what time
you'd be home at,

429
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,356
but 90 seconds in
the microwave should do it.

430
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,459
No one has ever
taken care of me like this.

431
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,295
Well, that makes me sad
because you deserve it.

432
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,167
Move in with us.

433
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,769
Are you sure?

434
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,109
You deserve
to be taken care of too.

435
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,290
Oh, you reek of champagne.

436
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:45,096
Hi, Alice.

437
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:49,100
Uh, I guess you've
blocked my number.

438
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,736
Anyway, um,
I just called to say...

439
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,905
I hope you have a good sleep.

440
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,507
Goodnight.

441
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,149
What happened to you?

442
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,218
You're back?

443
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,421
I just... missed my bed.

444
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,234
So, thanks
for coming over, um...

445
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,369
Yeah.

446
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,015
I know it's
kind of like a weird time.

447
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,738
Thanks for inviting me.

448
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,373
Augh...

449
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,375
Yeah, um,
and actually,

450
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,578
the reason I asked you
to come over was, uh,

451
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,158
because I have something special
planned for your birthday.

452
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,349
Oh, fuck.

453
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,761
And I thought
I could give it to you now,

454
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,152
uh, since we're alone.

455
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,653
I told you not to do anything.

456
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,355
Yeah, yeah.
Sit.

457
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,662
I call this piece, "Monogamy."

458
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,564
Oh God, no...

459
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,084
Julian...

460
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,691
I want to spend
every second with you.

461
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,194
I want to watch you
wake up every morning.

462
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,629
I want to share everything.

463
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,199
Like, I'd use your toothbrush

464
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,811
and carry your garbage
in my pocket.

465
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,002
What?

466
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,382
Because it feels
like we're one person.

467
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,483
Your garbage is my garbage.

468
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,607
Your skin is my skin.

469
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,609
Let's be buried together
in the same casket

470
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,043
and be this close forever!

471
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,646
Okay, NJ, just stop!
Please!

472
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,648
I'm just speaking
from the heart!

473
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,518
Well, it's weird!

474
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,020
Look...

475
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,022
I'm... I'm just gonna say it.

476
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,525
I love you.

477
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,328
And I know you want to be
in an open relationship,

478
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,441
but I think I can be enough
if you just let me try.

479
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,632
No, just stop, okay?

480
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,868
I-I thought
you were cool with this!

481
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,839
You can't just trick me into
monogamy with your saxophone.

482
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,541
This...

483
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,743
isn't working.

484
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,687
Oh... fuck...

485
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,956
It worked.

486
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,759
It actually worked.
It's all gone!

487
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,061
It's all fuckin' gone!

488
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,963
Hello?!

489
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,367
What the hell?

490
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,302
I can't do this.

491
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,970
No, no, wait, Julian, please!

492
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,872
Hold on!

493
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,575
Julian, please, don't go!
Just wait for...

494
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,581
Unbelievable.

495
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,316
What is wrong with you?

496
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,085
Huh?

497
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,065
I did exactly what
you said to, and guess what?

498
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,789
It backfired!

499
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,691
Oh, hey, I'm... Look, I'm sorry.

500
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,926
I'm... I'm so sorry, I just...

501
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:02,994
Thanks a lot!
