1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,613
What's wrong with him?

2
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,450
He decided to go celibate.

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,985
I dunno, something
happened with julian.

4
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:22,787
Oh, no.
Wait, celibate?

5
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,856
Oh, no.
For how long?

6
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,224
A year.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,061
A yea...?

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,462
Can he still jerk it?

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,997
I dunno, why?

10
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,932
He is at a
notoriously horny age,

11
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,134
Arguably the horniest
he'll be in his whole life.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,237
I remember being that age.
Everything turned me on.

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,405
I couldn't walk down
the produce aisle for two years.

14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,307
I can hear you, you know.

15
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,575
Can you?

16
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,843
Sorry.

17
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,079
Uh, we just couldn't
help but notice you,

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,615
Uh, literally beating
those eggs.

19
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,016
Nathan mentioned something
happened with julian?

20
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,285
That you've sworn off...

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,887
I've sworn off
lying, cheating men.

22
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,289
Easier said than done, my man.

23
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:00,292
Julian wants to be
in an "open relationship,"

24
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,660
Which I guess means
that I'm not enough for him,

25
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,763
Which I guess means that
I'm not enough for anybody,

26
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,765
Which basically means
that my only option now

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,767
Is to take myself off the market
entirely and become a monk,

28
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:10,836
Which starts with...

29
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,203
Celibacy.

30
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,441
Well, that's some
airtight logic.

31
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,277
Look, I'm sorry about what
happened with julian, really.

32
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,180
Alright, but I'm worried
that if, you know,

33
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,249
You bottle up all your...
Energy...

34
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,096
You're just gonna end up
hurting yourself

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,452
More than someone else.

36
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,856
Basically what I'm saying is...

37
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:31,925
Jerk off.

38
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,994
No, what... what we're saying is,
is that...

39
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,396
Maybe this is a little extreme?

40
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,733
That you should try channelling
some of your pain into your art?

41
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,069
Your sax!

42
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,239
Your sax, not your sex.

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,517
You tell that boy to jerk it.

44
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,493
Hey!
Big day today.

45
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,962
Feeling good?

46
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,809
Okay, forget feeling good.
Are you feeling...

47
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,499
Stable?

48
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,338
Hello?

49
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,272
What?
Sorry.

50
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,873
Sta... stable?

51
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,075
Yeah, do you think
you're gonna be stable enough

52
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,922
To go to anger management?
Which...

53
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,078
You're going to today?

54
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,714
Yeah, yeah.
Fine, I'll go.

55
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:32,184
Great.
Great.

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,752
Aw, look at her!

57
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,153
So cute!

58
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,488
Hey, no!

59
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,689
No!
What are you doing?

60
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,524
Stop it!
We're having breakfast!

61
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,660
Are you gonna be okay
alone with tula today?

62
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,262
Uh, no, I don't think so!

63
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,331
And last night I was lying awake
in a state of terror,

64
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,799
And I realized,

65
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,813
I'm gonna need to bring in
some outside help for this.

66
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,581
- This is what I came up with.
- Rover?

67
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,649
Isn't that for finding
dog-sitters?

68
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,072
And cat-sitters.

69
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,207
This is the profile I made.

70
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,210
It's a spider."

71
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,713
Tarantula."

72
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,083
Eight
furry legs, and even more eyes."

73
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,286
I cannot stress this enough,

74
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,621
"my dog is a tarantula,
who I'm deathly afraid of,

75
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,257
"and don't know
how to care for."

76
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,824
No one's gonna respond to this.

77
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,294
Oh!

78
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,565
Look who just got a bite.

79
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,832
Who on earth would bite?

80
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,050
We're in a unique position
with male birth control,

81
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,175
As there is no playbook
when it comes to marketing it.

82
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,430
In that spirit,
we've put together a few pitches

83
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,912
To give you a variety of
creative directions to explore.

84
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,048
I love it.
Who's up first?

85
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,395
- Ha-ha!
- I'm up first.

86
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,163
- Take it away!
- The energizer bunny.

87
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,453
The pillsbury dough boy.

88
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,622
The seedless...

89
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,325
"raw dog."

90
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,761
Go full raw dog, baby."

91
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,396
A little fratty, but catchy.

92
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,999
Let's try something else.

93
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:58,136
Ram, what is manhood,
if not exploring new frontiers?

94
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:03,074
Men, it's time to show some grit
and make your grandpappy proud.

95
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,811
Men, be the first to become...

96
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,546
Seedless.

97
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,280
I mean, the boomers
are gonna love that one.

98
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,483
Not that they have a lot of
seeds left, to speak of.

99
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,684
Well...

100
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,130
Alright,
let's try something else.

101
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,355
Did you know that the church
invented "chivalry"

102
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,358
So that men would
stop acting like animals?

103
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:23,695
Now is the dawn
of a new chivalry.

104
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:28,333
Firing blanks, like a gentleman.

105
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,302
- Questions?
- I'm gonna be honest...

106
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,569
I'm amused.

107
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,705
Very fun,
but I'm just not seeing...

108
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,206
Okay, well, there are...

109
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,941
- Hi, sorry!
- Oh!

110
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,610
An americano for richie rich...

111
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,212
jenny?

112
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,594
Shit.
Wait...

113
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,248
Who got the oat milk latte?

114
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,583
Um... Ooh, ah, rosie,

115
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,297
Do you actually mind
trading with mo?

116
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,965
I don't want to go back
to that place.

117
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,455
It was slammed.

118
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,857
Ooh, wait.

119
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,193
The pill you all haven't shut up
about is male birth control?

120
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,673
- Mm-hm.
- It's cool, right?

121
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:00,265
Very cool.

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,634
I'm sorry,
but who is going to take that?

123
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,336
Men, jenny.

124
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,538
You think men
are actually gonna buy this?

125
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:07,767
If we do our jobs well.

126
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,141
It's so important
to do your job well.

127
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,458
Okay, if I was ever on
a date and a dude popped

128
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,045
Male birth control,
the only thing

129
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,747
That he would
"not be getting pregnant"

130
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,616
Is the tissues in his hands
after I walk on out of there

131
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,930
- And find myself a real man!
- Okay, thank you, jenny.

132
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,487
Are we done?
Are we done?

133
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,688
Yes, she is done.

134
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,090
Whatever!
Are we not among friends?

135
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,526
No, we're with a client, jenny.

136
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,228
Excuse me.

137
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,563
Oh...

138
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,876
jenny!

139
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,766
Go.

140
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,634
Wait, can we just...

141
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,172
Can we strike that interaction
from the record?

142
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,041
I think I may have
made a mistake.

143
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,876
Were you not
hearing some good stuff?

144
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,111
You know, before the insane
person interrupted us?

145
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,180
Ish?

146
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,315
"ish"?

147
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,583
Okay.

148
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,051
I appreciate your candour.

149
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,586
Look, you're all very creative,

150
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:58,055
But this is not just some new
drug that needs a cool campaign.

151
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,569
No, of course not.
It's special.

152
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,459
- We see that.
- It's more than that.

153
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,129
It's a paradigm-shifting,
conversation-starting,

154
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,064
Radical-ass nuclear warhead.

155
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,177
I'm trying to start
a whole new sexual revolution.

156
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,935
Right.

157
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:13,739
And I understand that is
a big ask, marketing-wise.

158
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,673
But that is what
I'm looking for.

159
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,708
We can get there.

160
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,909
I know we can.

161
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,412
I hope so.

162
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,749
- Fire jenny, please.
- Wha...

163
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,351
Why me?

164
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,957
Um...?

165
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,959
I know you're not prepping
the maggie peters meeting

166
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,961
Without me,
'cause you're not idiots...

167
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,295
Unless you are?

168
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,763
Easy now.

169
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,866
You've been looking like
you had your hands full.

170
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,100
These hands look full to you?

171
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,002
Let's be honest,

172
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,972
This book doesn't need
all our brains on it.

173
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,106
"success can be yours,
make lists, stay focused"

174
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,842
Kinda thing.
Easy-peasy.

175
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:51,910
Who found her?

176
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,044
Who brought her in here?

177
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,713
Who offered her the contract?

178
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,048
You're right.

179
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,318
But sometimes the baby
makes it difficult for us,

180
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,721
And you, frankly, to focus.

181
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,790
We just thought we'd sneak in
a little bit of extra prep.

182
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,059
Colin!

183
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,528
Get everyone in here.
Now, please.

184
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,798
Everyone!

185
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,934
Here's the deal.

186
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,136
Things may look
a little different,

187
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:22,808
But I assure you,
nothing has changed with me.

188
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,209
Preach!

189
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,479
I have not skipped
a goddamn beat

190
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,414
Since I've been back,

191
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,784
And I don't expect
to be treated as if I have.

192
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:37,288
There will be no more
meetings behind mine,

193
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,323
Or owen's, backs.

194
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,793
Is that clear?

195
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,095
Is that clear?

196
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,497
You know what?

197
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,619
I'm leading the maggie peters
meeting, alone.

198
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,501
Sloane, we've done
extensive research.

199
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,703
We've read multiple drafts.
We can't be doing...

200
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,239
You don't think I can
still read a book in an hour?

201
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,485
I'm leading the meeting today,

202
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,909
And you can all watch
how it's done.

203
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:03,481
Now, someone get me
the hand sanitizer from my desk.

204
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,454
You back.

205
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,822
So glad you're safe.

206
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,591
You were on the receiving end
of someone else's anger.

207
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,826
Did that awaken anything?

208
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,728
Yeah, actually, it did.

209
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,396
Of course.

210
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,705
Sliding back into rage is
a natural part of the process.

211
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,700
No, not rage.

212
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,470
In fact, the most surprising
thing is that I haven't

213
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,939
Been focusing on the things
that would make me angry.

214
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,874
So, what, then?

215
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,944
Um, it's the way that I felt,

216
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,612
Moments before.

217
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,781
Like, right in between...

218
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,817
Life and death.

219
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,419
It was exhilarating.

220
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,355
And the only thing
that's making me angry

221
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,890
Is that I can't seem to find
that feeling again.

222
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,092
Is that... Crazy?

223
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,359
Nope.

224
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,694
Seamus?

225
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,963
Anne, please continue.

226
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,169
Um, I felt like...

227
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,438
Like a hummingbird.

228
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,308
Like, reflexes were sharp,
and fear was gone.

229
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,076
Time slowing right down.

230
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,045
Okay, uh, no cross-talk.

231
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,147
Yeah!
Yeah, that's it!

232
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,382
Sort of like
time was like this lake

233
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,251
That I could swim around in.

234
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,053
And for a split-second
you let go...

235
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,088
And felt everything.

236
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,522
Why don't we let anne finish?

237
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,856
Yeah, that's absolutely...

238
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,658
Like, like anything
could happen.

239
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,259
And that's the feeling.

240
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,762
Seamus...

241
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,331
Anne.

242
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,471
Well, here we are.

243
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,641
Why are you being weird?

244
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,344
We really appreciate
everything you've done so far,

245
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,880
- More or less.
- Thanks!

246
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:47,385
Um, but some of us,
uh, were thinking

247
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:51,389
That maybe you'd be better
suited at a job where you can...

248
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,357
Let your full self shine.

249
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,093
- Rosie...
- What?

250
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,828
You are absolutely right.

251
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,830
I am not meant to be
someone's assistant,

252
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,565
Or support executive,
or whatever.

253
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,033
No.

254
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,368
I couldn't agree more.

255
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,104
I also couldn't agree more.

256
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,105
Great!

257
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,606
Woo!

258
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,041
I am so glad you understand.

259
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,244
So, like, what kind of
stuff will I be doing?

260
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,047
I'm so glad I'm not getting
lunches and coffees anymore.

261
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,682
- Eugh...
- Oh, oh.

262
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,584
Uh, no, no.
Um...

263
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,997
fire her.

264
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,665
You don't...
You don't work here anymore.

265
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,769
Could I pitch stuff?

266
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,657
Yeah, I feel like
I'd be good at pitching.

267
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,770
You know, I think our wires
are getting crossed a little...

268
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,094
Ooh, I know!

269
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,928
Some of your
creative ideas are...

270
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,231
How can I put this?
Like, not good.

271
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,333
So, what if you
ran them by me first

272
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,135
Before you embarrass yourself?

273
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,657
What should
we call that position?

274
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,939
Like, pitch-proofer?
Vibe-checker?

275
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,741
- Maybe.
- Ooh, kate, did you hear?

276
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,076
I have been promoted!
You better watch your back!

277
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,023
Yeah, I know
it didn't sound like it,

278
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,446
But that was a firing.

279
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,293
You have been fired, jenny.
Thanks for comin' in.

280
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,150
So sorry to see you go.

281
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,185
- Excuse me...?
- Yeah.

282
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,998
But we just created
this position.

283
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,156
And I can't wait
to see who fills it.

284
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,625
You're really scary.

285
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,693
Okay.

286
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,795
Wow.

287
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,900
Hey.

288
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:09,902
Seamus, right?

289
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,369
Hey.

290
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,638
Hummingbird.

291
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,842
You really got what
I was saying back there.

292
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,644
Have you also been hit by a car?

293
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,512
I, uh...

294
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,059
I almost drowned
a few years back.

295
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,515
Oh, wow.

296
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,918
Yeah, we were, uh...
We were up at this lake,

297
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,453
And my foot
got caught on a rope.

298
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,967
A few seconds
before I passed out,

299
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,323
My buddy pulled me up.

300
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,892
But...

301
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,461
I felt all the things
you described.

302
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,496
Been chasing
that feeling ever since.

303
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,964
Did you ever find it?

304
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,268
It's actually
what landed me here.

305
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,869
I stole the principal's car.

306
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,438
Took it for some donuts
in the staff parking lot.

307
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,706
What was that like?

308
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:49,807
It was...

309
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,509
Exactly like you described.

310
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:55,012
There was no time, no nothing.

311
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,280
Hm.

312
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,660
You should try it sometime.

313
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,051
Except I don't think
you can do donuts in an suv.

314
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,154
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess not.

315
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,156
Anyway,
got caught, got suspended,

316
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,625
And now I have to come here.

317
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,759
Don't really know why.

318
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,161
I'm not even angry.

319
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,463
Oh, yeah?

320
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,098
Well, um...

321
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,568
I mean, if you ever want to
talk about your "not anger,"

322
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,738
Here.

323
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,108
You're a shrink?

324
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,576
Well, damn, doc.

325
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,646
Maybe I'll see you around.

326
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,583
Hi!

327
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,419
- Thank god you're here.
- Hey!

328
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,388
So, where's that
gorgeous dog of yours?

329
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,390
If I wasn't clear,
uh, it's actually...

330
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,137
Don't worry,
I know it's a spider, man.

331
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,905
I'm just making a joke.
That's how I joke.

332
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,796
So, um, where is she?

333
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,069
Uh, do you have any meal worms?

334
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,715
In the bag here.
There's some...

335
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,806
Oh!

336
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,111
You just gotta
lift the lid, and then...

337
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,213
Open the can of worms.

338
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,481
And then you take
one of these little guys...

339
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,617
Sorry, buddy!

340
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,521
And lower it down, gently...

341
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,522
And last-a-mundo, shut the lid!

342
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,860
Oh, god!

343
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,628
She's eating!

344
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,097
Yeah, she is!

345
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,299
Nature is such
a beautiful thing.

346
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,399
Is it?

347
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,438
Hey.

348
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,285
You shit-canned that
new assistant, huh?

349
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,842
Who, jenny?
Yeah, why?

350
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:31,976
You fond of her?

351
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,111
Me?
Oh god, no, no.

352
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,112
No, no, no, no.

353
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,915
No, but I was thinking
all morning about what she said.

354
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,595
Oh, how she claimed
her grandmother invented

355
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,019
Greek yogurt?

356
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,788
- No, about seedless.
- Oh?

357
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,456
And as awful as she was,

358
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,392
I'm wondering if her mindset
is not more common

359
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,759
Than we might think.

360
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,729
That maybe this men's product
could use the wisdom

361
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,097
Of a few more women?

362
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:57,235
- Huh.
- Think about it.

363
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,736
I've been on the pill so long,

364
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,138
I may as well just stay on it.
It's...

365
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,540
It's simpler that way.

366
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,276
It is embarrassing to admit,

367
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:09,480
But even if he did
agree to it, I...

368
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,642
I don't think I could trust
my husband to take it.

369
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,217
Interesting, okay.

370
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,620
Does anyone else
relate to this sentiment?

371
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,820
Oh.

372
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,657
Can I talk to you for a second?

373
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,824
Uh-huh.

374
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,671
Okay, well, um, next question...

375
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,194
How many of these have you done?

376
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,628
This would be my third.

377
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,098
- And they all feel this way?
- Yeah, I know.

378
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,178
Not exactly the paradigm shift
we'd imagined, huh?

379
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,003
This is gonna break
denise richards' heart.

380
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,203
Sorry, is she...

381
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,339
Is she involved?

382
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,052
Yeah, she's
the brains behind the drug,

383
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,176
Medically speaking of course.

384
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,711
You're telling me that
wild things' denise richards

385
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,914
Is medically responsible
for seedless?

386
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,782
No, the lead scientist.

387
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,517
Her name is denise richards,
also.

388
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,819
Oh...

389
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,520
She basically
figured out how to target

390
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,655
A protein called rar...

391
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,424
Yeah, you don't care.

392
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,128
So, a woman developed this drug?

393
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,595
I mean, that's an angle.

394
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,131
Sure... How?

395
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,334
Well, you have her speak
directly to the consumer.

396
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,804
Seedless was developed
by a woman for men,

397
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,873
But it's actually
really for women...

398
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,208
Mm-hm.

399
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,921
And we deliver that message

400
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,011
From the woman who made it.

401
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,713
Well...

402
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,483
Maybe you should meet denise
before putting her on camera.

403
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,051
Is that a challenge?

404
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:24,221
This pill that you helped create
is a game-changer, full stop.

405
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,958
My pr firm and your company feel
there is no better spokesperson

406
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,961
For seedless than
the brilliant, real-life woman

407
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,096
Who brought it to this world.

408
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,900
Uh...

409
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,768
So, uh...
So what do you think?

410
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,103
Um...

411
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,605
That's just a real
thick smoothie.

412
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,508
I could get you a spoon, or...

413
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,577
Ah, no.

414
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,845
Tell ya what.

415
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,715
I'll do your little commercial.

416
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,249
Oh!

417
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,918
Look, just so we're on
the same page, it's, uh...

418
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,186
It's not gonna be so little.

419
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,520
Oh.

420
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,634
Well, you know what,
I am very passionate about this,

421
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,891
So I mean, I'd love to
help out however I can.

422
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,327
Great.

423
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,929
Plus, you know, this sounds
like a hoot and a scream.

424
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,865
I always tell people, "hey,
if it's a hoot and a scream,

425
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:08,933
"count me in."

426
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,336
Don't I say that, wallace?

427
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,937
Wallace...
Wallace!

428
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,807
Yeah, he can't hear me.

429
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,542
Anyway, yeah, so, uh...

430
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,477
I'm in!

431
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,145
Well, uh...
Well, great.

432
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,613
I am thrilled to hear that.

433
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,483
Great.
Wallace...

434
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,951
Wallace!

435
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,821
What did I say about wearing
headphones in my lab, okay?

436
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,023
Hey, buddy, one more time

437
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,936
And I'm gonna dissolve
those things in acid.

438
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,159
Yeah, me, I'm talking.

439
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,539
I can mould anyone.

440
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,563
I can mould anyone.

441
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,163
I will do it this time.

442
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,165
Okay, I will...
We will be in touch.

443
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,533
Okay!
Mm-hm.

444
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,376
Sorry to keep you
waiting, maggie!

445
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,290
We were doing an awful
lot of burping in there.

446
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,047
Him, not me.

447
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,281
So!

448
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,983
"tasking!"

449
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:03,821
I've been studying your
manuscript and I gotta say, wow!

450
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,257
It's really gonna
make a difference.

451
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,103
So many people can't keep
their heads on straight

452
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,528
When they get busy,
so I think readers are...

453
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,465
okay, shh, shhh, shhh.

454
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,067
Sorry.

455
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,603
As you can see, I am not
the maternity leave type.

456
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,149
Want me to take him, sloane?

457
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,673
No, thank you.
I've got it under control.

458
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,408
Okay, where was I?

459
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,376
You were saying
something about readers?

460
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,778
Anyway,

461
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:31,349
When wynston originally
offered you this contract,

462
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,684
We had our eyes
on your loyal fan base.

463
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:37,355
And I think that you actually
have a broader appeal, and...

464
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,758
Okay, okay.

465
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,793
Yeah,
can I ask what your thoughts are

466
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,362
On the final chapter?

467
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,131
- The...
- The final chapter.

468
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,040
"three golden rules
for the task at hand"?

469
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,637
Mm-hm, so good.

470
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,972
You know, we loved
just how you embrace the...

471
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,640
I'd love to hear
sloane's thoughts,

472
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,510
If that's okay.

473
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,911
It's effective.

474
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,714
Uh-huh, go on.

475
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:07,985
And it's, you know, about, um...

476
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,655
Success, and...

477
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,459
Success,
how it can be anybody's...

478
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,771
That's what I thought.

479
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,995
You didn't finish the book.

480
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,331
Excuse me?

481
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,966
Sloane,
I've made all the mistakes

482
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,667
I'm watching you make right now.

483
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,336
I wrote a book about it.

484
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,782
It's the one you
skimmed this afternoon.

485
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,905
Okay, alright.

486
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,941
Well, let's just take
it down a notch here.

487
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,276
Look, I had a new baby,

488
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,810
Tried to go on a speaking tour

489
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:37,080
And write a book
all at the same time.

490
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,717
You know what all that
multi-tasking led to?

491
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,219
A nervous breakdown
onstage in st. Louis.

492
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,288
Okay, well, not to be rude,

493
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,757
But most people don't
have the luxury

494
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,426
Of doing one task at a time.

495
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,295
And some of us don't want to.

496
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,829
I don't mean to be rude,

497
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:56,901
But your approach
is not sustainable.

498
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,037
Look, if you want to try
and balance deep work

499
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,740
With a newborn baby,
go right ahead.

500
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,576
But not at my expense.

501
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,645
Call me when
we're all on the same page.

502
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:08,880
Okay, maggie...

503
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,783
Maggie...

504
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,053
Nice one.

505
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,205
You know,
I've been thinking a lot

506
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,806
About our conversation
the other night.

507
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,063
The birth control thing.

508
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,599
- I was way off.
- Oh?

509
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,235
That stuff I was
saying about men

510
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,669
Not wanting to take it?

511
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,872
That was some old-world,
toxic masculinity bullshit.

512
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,341
Did somebody do some reading?

513
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,876
I browsed
a few jezebel articles,

514
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,012
But the point is,
it was a weak argument,

515
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,282
And I am ready to correct
my behaviour.

516
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,083
Yeah?
How?

517
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,285
For starters,
I threw away your birth control

518
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,432
And I started taking that
seedless you brought home.

519
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,456
So I'm gonna need
a re-up pretty soon.

520
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,425
Did jezebel
also tell you to, um,

521
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,294
Take away my agency
by chucking my birth control?

522
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,562
Yeah...

523
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,431
I-I didn't fully think
that one through.

524
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,699
Mm-hm.

525
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,601
You're a nice boy
and you mean well.

526
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,836
You know what?
Alright, yeah.

527
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,104
Let's try this out.

528
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,973
- Yeah?
- Mm!

529
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,907
I have to admit, I am curious.

530
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,710
But how about that, huh?

531
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,980
Both father and son both looking
down at the rig god gave them

532
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,955
And just saying,
"no thanks, don't need it."

533
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,583
Well, hold on,
taking birth control

534
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,919
Is not the same thing
as a vow of celibacy!

535
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,588
Here's to trying out that
new useless penis of yours!

536
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,123
I'm sure it's still fun.

537
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,929
Sorry.

538
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,456
You've
reached dr. Anne carlson.

539
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,924
Yeah, did you take my car?

540
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,615
And where are you?

541
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,817
Ya-hoooo!

542
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:01,893
Woo!

543
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,093
Yeah!

544
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:07,164
Yeah!
Woooooo!

545
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,257
