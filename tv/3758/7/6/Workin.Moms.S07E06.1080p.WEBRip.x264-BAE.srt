1
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,841
What are you doing?

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,109
Watching you.

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,511
Why?

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,353
Do you have anything
you want to tell me?

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,581
No.

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,848
Are you sure about that?

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,884
Let's go, let's go!

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,486
Hey, uh, quick reminder,

9
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,098
The jaymester and I
have tee-ball tonight!

10
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,567
- Anne, you're working late?
- Yup.

11
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,591
Okay, alice,
you can fend for yourself?

12
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:27,526
- Yup.
- Great, let's go!

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,499
Um...

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,868
Is there a reason we're
just looking at each other?

15
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,804
Is there anything new at school?

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,139
Any new...

17
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,706
Friends?

18
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,809
Okay, I don't know
why you're being weird.

19
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,325
That, right there.
That.

20
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:49,548
Who... who're you texting?

21
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,283
Your drug dealer?

22
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:54,686
Okay, if you must know...

23
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,355
I've been seeing this guy.

24
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,657
I knew it!

25
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,303
That's interesting.
Were you ever gonna tell us?

26
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:01,226
I'm telling you now.

27
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,695
Well, maybe you
should have mentioned

28
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,342
This information before,
you know, so that people have

29
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,876
All the information
they need to move forward

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,033
With all of the information.

31
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,913
You know how secrets
affect your father!

32
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,471
I think secrets affect
everyone, really.

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,105
Is it serious?

34
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,708
I mean... It's not...

35
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,043
Not serious...?

36
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,889
Okay, you should
really tell us when things

37
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,913
Are not "not serious"!

38
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,648
Why?
'cause...

39
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,718
Okay, mom, I'll be sure
to keep you posted

40
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,521
About everything that's going on
in my life from now on.

41
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,190
Like right now,
I have to get to school.

42
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,532
That's not such a bad secret!

43
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,801
I bet he's really nice.

44
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,272
Alright, mama's just
gotta get caffeinated,

45
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,741
And then I will be out the door.

46
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:53,111
Good morning!

47
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,812
I brought coffee.

48
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:58,716
Manifest that shit, right?

49
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,019
So, how was your bundle date?

50
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,354
Uh, it was...

51
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,756
It was good.

52
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,091
Now I need to find my...

53
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,625
Keys?

54
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,661
Thank you!

55
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,196
So, what'd you guys talk about?

56
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,298
You know, all the weird
thoughts and feelings

57
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,033
You have when you
bring home a baby,

58
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,102
The ones you think
you're the only one having.

59
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,082
He had some I hadn't even
thought of, actually.

60
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,505
I'm sorry, "he"?

61
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,941
Yeah, this guy
came in place of his wife

62
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,443
Who couldn't make it.

63
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,156
I thought bundle app
was for new mothers

64
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,348
To meet other new mothers.

65
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,649
I'm sorry, are you jealous?

66
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,251
How sweet!

67
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,987
I'm not...
no, I'm just saying,

68
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,322
I don't know how much
this dude can know about

69
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,324
Lactating at work and...

70
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,859
I'm meeting alyssa today,
the mom.

71
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,429
The real mom, and we're
gonna talk "mom" things.

72
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:47,132
And I'm gonna be late, so, uh...

73
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,268
Now I just need my...

74
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,869
Phone.

75
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,306
It's like you know what I need
before I need it.

76
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,274
And don't you forget it.

77
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,242
Sorry.

78
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,678
Have fun on
your date with alyssa.

79
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:02,648
Getting seedless on
"the best lay" was brilliant.

80
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,685
In fact, we'd love to open up
the fronterraverse...

81
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,486
Time out...
"fronterraverse"?

82
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,562
No?
It's no good?

83
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,856
Oh, that's terrible.

84
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,235
It's just something
I'm trying out.

85
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,258
- Fronterra-sphere?
- Oh, boy.

86
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,559
Fronterra-opolis?

87
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,094
I mean, let's stick
with "fronterraverse."

88
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,762
Least offensive.

89
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,766
Well... We would just love to
get your eyes on another product

90
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,166
That we're excited about.

91
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,102
Really?
Okay, what is it?

92
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,403
It's called horamo.

93
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,839
It's a migraine pill
that's tested extremely well

94
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,974
In clinical trials.

95
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,353
You know,
I used to get migraines.

96
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,843
If I overdo it with salt,

97
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,490
It's like a wrecking ball
to my head.

98
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,680
And they're brutal.

99
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,448
But horamo is a miracle pill,

100
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,383
And branding it as such is key.

101
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,718
So, if you're interested,

102
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,287
I would love to spitball
some angles with you.

103
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,589
Uh, yeah, for sure.

104
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,457
I got a bunch of meetings today,

105
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,036
But you wanna
come back around 4?

106
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,460
Or we could ditch the office,

107
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,240
Maybe go somewhere
a little more inspiring?

108
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,698
- I know just the place.
- Oh.

109
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,099
So, what do you say?
You up for a field trip?

110
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,434
Yeah, I love field trips.

111
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,669
Okay, great.

112
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,739
I will text you the address.

113
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,106
Oh, mysterious.

114
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,875
Where are we going
on this field trip, huh?

115
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,944
Pioneer village?

116
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,746
See what life
was like before, uh,

117
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:11,216
Pharmaceutical companies?

118
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,819
Yeah.

119
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,091
Okay.

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,893
Listen, seamus.

121
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,296
I've really enjoyed
our time together,

122
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,364
But I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

123
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,899
No bad news today, doc.

124
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,301
Good news only!

125
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,702
Well...

126
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,037
I finally got
the green light from my girl.

127
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,705
What does that mean?

128
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,810
Sex?

129
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,113
What, uh...

130
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,914
What happened
to taking things slow?

131
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,916
To the...
To the rush of waiting?

132
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,853
Yeah, that, um...

133
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,154
That ship's kinda sailed.

134
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,790
I mean, we're...

135
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,391
We're ready.

136
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,661
Yeah, so, alice...
That's her name...

137
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,295
Is it?

138
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,931
Yeah, so alice invited
me over to her place.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,534
To my... to her house?

140
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,935
Are her parents cool with it?

141
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,247
They probably don't know.

142
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,538
They might.

143
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,807
Yeah, but I think they're
gonna be out around 5.

144
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,386
That's when she said
to come over.

145
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,210
Is that today?
It's all goin' down today?

146
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,945
That's the plan.

147
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,614
Wow.

148
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,949
That's so... Fast.

149
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,284
Five o'clock?

150
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,139
Five o'fucking clock!

151
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,354
I'm gonna break his knees.

152
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,556
I'm gonna break his
goddamn fucking knees!

153
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,191
Well, someone's sounding
like their old selves again.

154
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,227
And, sorry, what exactly
is your plan here?

155
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,628
Oh, I got a plan.

156
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,764
I cancelled my end of day,
outta here by 4,

157
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,811
And I'm heading straight home
to scare the shit

158
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,268
Out of my daughter and put
that boy in a body cast.

159
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,815
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, alright?

160
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,238
I thought you liked this kid.

161
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,908
I thought you said he was
nice and fun and exciting.

162
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,843
I mean, maybe he'd
be good for alice.

163
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,812
Yeah, I don't want him
to deflower her!

164
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,680
But you do realize
you'll blow your cover

165
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,482
The second you walk
through that door.

166
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,517
Shit, I didn't think of that.
Um...

167
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,919
Uh, fuck, okay.

168
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,787
New plan.
I need you to do it.

169
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,255
- What? I can't!
- Why?

170
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,390
First of all, it's psycho.

171
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,124
Second, I've got
a client meeting.

172
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,604
Lemme guess,
with your work crush?

173
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,761
No.

174
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,995
Yes.

175
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,931
Augh, just forget it.
I'll do it myself.

176
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,577
You're gonna bone yourself!

177
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,468
Well, as long as I'm
the only one getting boned!

178
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,574
So, what do you think?

179
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,375
Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

180
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,677
Really?
What's it worth?

181
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:23,348
Beaut like that, get you 4k.

182
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,082
Holy shit!

183
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,151
I mean, 6k.

184
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,218
3k.

185
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,287
Thirty-five.

186
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,587
- Sold.
- Shit!

187
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,825
Fine.

188
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,367
There you go.

189
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,903
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

190
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,438
Okay, zoe, let's get outta here.

191
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,177
So, let's get you
a little treat.

192
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,782
But first, something for mommy!

193
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,115
Hand it over!

194
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,350
Whatever you got!

195
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,188
Get out of here, fuckwad!

196
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,722
Okay.

197
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,391
Okay.
Yeah, oh fuck, fuck.

198
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,060
Fine, fine.

199
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,398
You let him take it?

200
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,134
What else am I supposed to do?

201
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,676
It won't stop coming.

202
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,378
I'm engorged all the time.

203
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,949
And now I have all this milk
that nobody wants or needs.

204
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,486
Oh, I tried wrapping them in
cabbage, but they won't dry up.

205
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,488
You've come to the right place.

206
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,156
We're currently
accepting donations.

207
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:43,294
Okay, let's go.

208
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,699
Just a few more.

209
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,468
Not too, too many more,
I don't think.

210
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,836
Unbelievable.

211
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,072
I am so sorry.
I'll be done in a minute.

212
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,374
No, what's unbelievable
is that you have so much milk

213
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,510
And you're not
trying to sell it.

214
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,177
I can sell it?

215
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,589
You know what, sheila?
I'll be in touch.

216
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,257
Thank you.

217
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,993
I heard this class
was pretty good.

218
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,996
Yeah, I just felt like I
should take it, you know?

219
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,332
Single mom in the city!

220
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,802
I was actually advised
to take it, by the cops,

221
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,403
After I got mugged.

222
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,974
On your feet!

223
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,276
Welcome to
the citizen self-defence class.

224
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:36,247
I am your instructor,
gary goldman.

225
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,149
Oh, no.

226
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,751
Oh, hell no!

227
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,487
How 'bout...

228
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,623
This one?

229
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,159
Doesn't scream "tasking" to me.

230
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,095
Right.

231
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,841
Hey, here's a thought:
Maybe we don't

232
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,231
Do the image thing
on every chapter?

233
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,745
It's maggie's vision
for the book.

234
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,168
Take a walk with it.

235
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,837
What else have we got?

236
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,238
No.

237
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,640
We've used this one before.

238
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,808
Next.

239
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,677
No, I don't think we have.

240
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,044
But it could work.

241
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,114
No, I'm sure
I've seen her before.

242
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,315
Trust me.

243
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,484
I never forget
a stock image face.

244
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,997
Sloane, should I move on?

245
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,531
Sure.

246
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,034
Now, what do I mean
when I say "head on a swivel"?

247
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,503
I mean I want you to be
aware of your surroundings

248
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,273
And any possible dangers
at all times, okay?

249
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,208
You're telling me
you're all here for him?

250
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,010
So, imagine that
I am your attacker.

251
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,081
Who wants to volunteer
for a demonstration?

252
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,683
Great, jenny.
Perfect.

253
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,318
Yeah, but I didn't volunteer.

254
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,622
Now, your assailant will
not ask for a volunteer either.

255
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,024
Alright, now,
an unwavering centre of gravity

256
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,333
Is important in this situation.

257
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,893
So I take a stance like this,

258
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,362
And I want you to try
and knock me off balance.

259
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,065
You know I'm freakishly strong.

260
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,968
If you say so.

261
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,672
What the fuck is in there?

262
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,073
You were ready for me.

263
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,176
So I want another shot.

264
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,577
Feel free to surprise me.

265
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,581
Hey!

266
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,082
There.

267
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,919
Now you gonna let me do my job?

268
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,188
Uh-huh.

269
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,123
Thank you, jenny.

270
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,095
What was that?

271
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,463
And, like,
how are you so strong?

272
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,865
And, like...

273
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,132
Well, I train a lot.

274
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:39,137
Shut up!

275
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,573
What am I even doing?

276
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,618
Something wrong?

277
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,220
I've tried everything, val.

278
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,888
My baby won't drink formula

279
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,957
And my own milk
has suddenly dried up!

280
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,427
It just so happens that I might
have something that can help.

281
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,828
It'll cost you, though.

282
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,764
Money's not an issue!
I just don't know what...

283
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,766
Shh, shh... Lemme get you
somethin' real nice.

284
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,639
Ah, ah!

285
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,776
You want the milk,
you gotta cough up the cheese.

286
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,787
Is that enough?

287
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,522
Thank you.

288
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,798
Oh, hey, any of you mamas
havin' trouble with your supply?

289
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,999
I got the good stuff.

290
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,469
Tit to table.
I don't fuck around.

291
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,870
Listen up.

292
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,204
I've been downing apricots.

293
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,339
Sardines.

294
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,308
Nothing but yolks.

295
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,254
Looks like that hungry little
baby needs an upgrade

296
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,145
From skim...

297
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,147
To cream.

298
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,017
I'll see you tomorrow.
There you go.

299
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,520
Got your purple nerp, your
dairy daze, classic og skim.

300
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,956
Any takers for some
super sour grandma skunk?

301
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,705
Hey!

302
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:21,806
Me again!

303
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,307
Aw, wife couldn't make it?

304
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,575
No, no, no, no.

305
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,477
She got caught up
in another meeting, so...

306
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,712
Where's your... Baby?

307
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,516
Who are you and what the fuck
do you want from me?

308
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:35,052
What?
What are you talking about?

309
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,721
Is your wife
a stock photo model?

310
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,991
Okay, alright.
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,961
I saw your profile
on my sister's bundle app

312
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,729
And I borrowed her kid,

313
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,465
Because I'm an author

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,636
And I really would hope that you
would read my manuscript.

315
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,404
Oh, this is great.

316
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,207
It is great.
It's, um, a fantasy novel...

317
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,475
Yeah, of course it is.

318
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,409
About a cynical teen.

319
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,144
So, catcher in the rye.

320
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,013
He and his friends,
they get stranded.

321
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,581
Mm, meets lord of the flies.

322
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,149
But get this... he's a wizard!

323
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,784
Meets harry fucking potter!

324
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,420
Is there an original thought
in your head anywhere?

325
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,423
Whoa, you don't
have to be so mean!

326
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:17,228
No wonder you need
an app to find friends.

327
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:21,132
Yeah, that's right, I do.

328
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,701
Because new motherhood
is isolating.

329
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,970
And it's really hard to find
friends going through that

330
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,638
When you work as hard as I do.

331
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,308
Which you can't relate to,
since you're too busy

332
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,978
Borrowing babies to bait
and stalk innocent women.

333
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,246
You know what?

334
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,026
That's actually
a great idea for a book.

335
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,818
I might green-light that.

336
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,230
Really?
Should we work on that?

337
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:44,088
You might wanna fuck off.

338
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,762
When I look back on it,

339
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,998
I think my marriage
was destined to fail.

340
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,935
I think I've always been trying
to re-create a family unit...

341
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,704
- Mm.
- Ever since

342
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,973
My parents were ripped away
from me in the accident.

343
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,008
And that's our time, mark!

344
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,676
Okay.

345
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,857
I'm sorry to rush you,
I just... I have somewhere to be.

346
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,882
Uh, is it okay if I use
your bathroom real quick?

347
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,350
Oh, yeah.
There's just...

348
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,587
There's just a key that I
need you to return, so...

349
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,222
Uh, please?

350
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:22,226
Oh, uh, okay, if you could just,
uh, maybe be quick about it.

351
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,506
- Yeah.
- Okay.

352
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,063
- You got it.
- Yup, thanks.

353
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,636
Hey, I don't mean to be rude,

354
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,015
But are you almost
done in there?

355
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,838
Uh, I'll just be a second!

356
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:39,710
Okay, it's just that it's
a bit of an emergency for me.

357
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,779
Mark?

358
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,852
Just... just keep the key!

359
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,120
Fuck!

360
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,321
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

361
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,989
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

362
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,926
Shit, fuck!
Shit, fuck!

363
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,527
Okay...

364
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,663
Oh, hey!
I had a little oopsie!

365
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,331
I dinged your bumper.

366
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,244
I was about to leave you a note!
I'm so sorry!

367
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,035
No, it's okay!

368
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,082
No, no, I want to do things the
right way, okay, so I think...

369
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,449
My daughter is about
to be penetrated!

370
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,207
Please move, come on!

371
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,222
Centre?

372
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,490
This is your goldmine
of inspiration?

373
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,359
Look, you laugh,
but I've come up with

374
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,094
Some pretty
sophisticated ideas here.

375
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,298
Uh-huh.
Oh!

376
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,433
Okay, trust me.

377
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,101
- This is the place.
- Okay.

378
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,714
We just gotta try
and keep an open mind.

379
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,972
Alright, open.

380
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,907
We just...

381
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,577
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.

382
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,646
Oh, I'm inspired.

383
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,450
Okay, maybe this is just
not the right display.

384
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,829
- Okay.
- Okay, let's, let's...

385
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:54,919
Okay.

386
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,788
This could be something
right here.

387
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,990
Uh...

388
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,591
Uh...

389
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,593
No, yeah, it's nothing.

390
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,194
It's nothing.

391
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,663
How about a wrecking ball
to the skull, right?

392
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,331
Ooh!

393
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,801
How about, like, a woodpecker
right at your temple?

394
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,936
I mean, it's less impact...
Uh...

395
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,137
A little cartoony, maybe?

396
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,884
- Cartoony, cartoony.
- Something better.

397
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,008
- We don't like cartoons.
- No, no.

398
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,717
What... what...
What is this?

399
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,678
It's inspirational,
is what it is.

400
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,814
Clearly you've brought me
to the goldmine.

401
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,615
Okay, alright.

402
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,697
We're trying... I'm trying.

403
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,818
You are trying!

404
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,287
I'm so sorry,
I have to take this.

405
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,435
Uh, you wanna wrangle up
some of those dino costumes?

406
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,657
Maybe that'll help?

407
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,892
Hey, what's up?

408
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,405
Would you mind picking up

409
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,207
Some cheese on your way home
for pizza night?

410
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,541
Ella threw it
all over the floor.

411
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,631
Shit, I'm so sorry.

412
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,700
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna be late.

413
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,436
I'm brainstorming
a new drug for fronterra.

414
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,438
Oh, okay.

415
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,373
Just gonna eat at
the office, then?

416
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,109
I'm, uh...
I'm not at the office.

417
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,710
I'm at the science centre.

418
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,911
Cool.

419
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,313
That sounds fun.

420
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,859
You out there with
the whole team?

421
00:16:56,883 --> 00:17:01,118
No, uh, it's funny, I'm just...
It's just ram and I.

422
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,387
The fronterra ceo.

423
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,256
Oh...
Okay.

424
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,391
Yeah.

425
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,605
Yeah, apparently it's a good
place to generate ideas.

426
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,695
I'm not sold yet.

427
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,197
Right.
Well...

428
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,532
You two have fun.

429
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,833
I mean, it's not gonna be fun.

430
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,601
Just work.
Anyway, I love you.

431
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,538
Bye!

432
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,740
- Hey.
- Mm, hi!

433
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,675
Uh, there's something
I want to show you.

434
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,877
Cool.
Let's get to work.

435
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,953
Okay...

436
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,023
I see the appeal.

437
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,226
- Right?
- Wow...

438
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,361
Oh my god.

439
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,146
Okay, what's that one?
Is that orion?

440
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,435
That's uranus.

441
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,838
Oh.

442
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,374
Oh, what's that one?

443
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,576
Ah, that's also uranus.

444
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,252
You don't know
what any of these are?

445
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,579
No!

446
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:06,984
I don't have to know
what they are to be amazed.

447
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,787
Call me a dork,
but when I need it,

448
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,657
This room is my escape.

449
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,525
I totally get it.

450
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,394
For me, it's the aquarium.

451
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,775
Another great place to look at
shit you know nothing about.

452
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,333
Yeah?

453
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,277
Man, it's quiet in here.

454
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,546
Yeah.

455
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,816
I mean, that's kinda
why I love it.

456
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,284
The outside world's all gone.

457
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,354
No noise, no distractions.

458
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,423
It's all gone.

459
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,758
It's all gone.

460
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,364
It's all gone.

461
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,367
Your headache,
the pain, the migraine.

462
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,136
"it's all gone."

463
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,175
Yeah, I like it.

464
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:08,779
Yeah, it's simple,
it's straightforward.

465
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,581
Yeah, it's a good
place to start.

466
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,783
I guess this place
isn't just for kids.

467
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,585
Alright, astro-boys and girls,

468
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,920
Get ready for blast-off!

469
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,789
Oh my god.
Clearly for children.

470
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,457
Is it?

471
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:24,494
Two-hundred
billion trillion stars.

472
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,464
Pick up, pick up, pick up!
Come on!

473
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,110
Hi, this is alice.

474
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,201
Please leave a message.

475
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,336
Fuck.

476
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,736
Turn off this goddamn...

477
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,341
Fuck sakes.

478
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,609
Hey, man!

479
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,611
Hey, is there any way
I can squeeze through?

480
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,479
No can do.
Gonna be another 10.

481
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,747
You can take bloor across.

482
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,283
What?
That's gonna take forever!

483
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,584
Put on a podcast.

484
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,452
Fucking put on a podcast...

485
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,087
Ugh!

486
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,890
Why does god hate me?!

487
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,827
Jesus fucking christ!

488
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,430
Gah!

489
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,332
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

490
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,701
Alice!

491
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,903
Okay, you're by yourself.
I can work with this.

492
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,349
Mom!
What are you doing here?

493
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,976
I just, I thought that you...

494
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,177
Wait...

495
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,785
What are you looking at?

496
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,388
Your hair...

497
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:30,494
Cheeks...

498
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,396
Sweat beads...
Oh...

499
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,000
God, you did it, didn't you?

500
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,735
You motherfucker!

501
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,270
You had sex with my daughter?

502
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,671
Wait, doc, you're her mom?

503
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,239
You're his doctor?

504
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,919
- She's your daughter?
- He's your patient?

505
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:44,975
No more questions!

506
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,610
Who wants dinner?

507
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,212
Why are you all home?

508
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,214
Who's this?

509
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,425
What the fuck is that?!

510
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,994
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

511
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,083
Nobody move, nobody move!

512
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,852
Oh my god!

513
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,888
- Lionel, get it!
- It's getting away!

514
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,690
Okay!
I got 'er!

515
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,493
I got 'er.
Ha-ha!

516
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,895
Sorry, who are you?

517
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:05,964
Sorry, who are you?
