1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,436
Put 'em up, bitches,
it's ladies' night!

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,505
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm!

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,007
Well, Mel's cheating on me.

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,841
- What?
- No!

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,843
Yes, ma'ams.
Not a doubt in my mind.

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,290
What, uh...
What makes you think that?

7
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,646
Oh, it's obvious.

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,815
He's cagey and secretive

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,894
and slinking around
behind my back.

10
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,318
Mm-hm.

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,053
I've tried asking him about it.

12
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:21,920
He didn't blink
for a solid minute.

13
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,055
Leave him.

14
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,057
Well, hang on...

15
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:27,326
Pull that cord
before it strangles you.

16
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,706
Well, well, let's just hold on.
Let's not get crazy.

17
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,331
I just... first of all, you don't
have any actual evidence.

18
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,433
And second, even if
he was cheating on you,

19
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,667
which he isn't,

20
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,836
Nathan cheated on me,

21
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,239
and, uh,
we've never been happier.

22
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,740
Huh?

23
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,442
The point is, we shouldn't be

24
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,444
worrying about
this tonight, okay?

25
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,623
Tonight is supposed to be
about turnin' it up,

26
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,947
you know what I mean?

27
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,328
Honestly, I don't think
I'm in the right head space

28
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,030
to turn anything up tonight,
what with Mel obviously...

29
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,487
definitely cheating on me.

30
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,556
It's not obvious.
Nothing obvious about it.

31
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:58,735
In fact, you know what?
I have to clear my head.

32
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,692
Excuse me, ladies.

33
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,072
Great idea!
Take a lap, clear that head.

34
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,063
Very smart.

35
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,165
Mel's not cheating on Val,
he's proposing.

36
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,166
Tonight!

37
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,967
No!

38
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,769
Yes!
It's supposed to be a surprise.

39
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,349
We're supposed to
show her a great time.

40
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:14,073
- Good job, by the way.
- Well...

41
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,175
And then get her
to the gazebo by 7 pm.

42
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,754
Why didn't you tell us this
in the first place?

43
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,079
'Cause Mel didn't
want us to know.

44
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:21,458
He thought she'd pick up on it.
She's very perceptive...

45
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,382
you know, when she's not...

46
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,095
jumping to the opposite
conclusion, I guess.

47
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:25,884
You definitely
should have told us.

48
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,087
Mm-hm.

49
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,766
It doesn't matter, okay?
We gotta get back on track,

50
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,867
because tonight
has to be perfect.

51
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,324
Okay.

52
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,993
Oh my God, the Mountie's here.

53
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,396
Buckle up, ladies, this night
just took a nose dive!

54
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,803
Oh!

55
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,004
Oh...

56
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,539
I don't get it.

57
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,918
So you saw a Mountie?
Big deal.

58
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,342
Not "a" Mountie, Sloane.

59
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:53,345
"The" Mountie.
As in, Val's ex.

60
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,614
The man I called "husband"
for 16 years

61
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,527
before he disappeared
in the dead of night,

62
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,795
never to be heard
or seen from again.

63
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,153
Holy shit, okay.

64
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:02,754
Okay, so what are you gonna do?

65
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,723
Well, you probably
wanna go, huh?

66
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,136
I'll get the cheque,
we'll get out of here.

67
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,726
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

68
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,761
If there's one thing
I'm sure of,

69
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,108
I'm gonna talk to him,
and I am going to take...

70
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,164
my...

71
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,165
time.

72
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,566
Yes!

73
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,035
No.

74
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,438
You've already wasted
so much time on this guy, right?

75
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,839
We got a fun night ahead.

76
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,942
Here goes nothin'.

77
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,644
You guys had one job!

78
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,224
- What the fuck?
- What do you...

79
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,183
Okay, quick and to the point.

80
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,752
Wow.

81
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,387
Wait, what is she doing?

82
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:38,657
I don't like this.

83
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,259
BRB, ladies.

84
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,860
Time to take a trip to the past.

85
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,562
Wait, where are you going?

86
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,841
The Mountie
wants to step outside

87
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,266
so he can explain himself.

88
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,845
And I, frankly, want to step
outside so I can raise my voice.

89
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,402
Ten minutes, tops.

90
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,003
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

91
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,605
Oh, Anne,
I'm gonna do that thing...

92
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,974
What is it you say?
I'm gonna...

93
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,954
yank his scrotum up over
his head like an atomic wedgie.

94
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,077
Yeah, that sounds like me.

95
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,979
I'm gonna decimate him.

96
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,414
Isn't this exhilarating?

97
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,416
It is, oh, it is,

98
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,862
but you know what else
could be exhilarating?

99
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,819
The four of us go to the movies!

100
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,488
Kate, you know,

101
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,990
I'm gettin'
a weird vibe from you.

102
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,170
Do you not want to see your
best friend have some closure?

103
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,893
No, I do, I do!

104
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:15,427
I actually... like,
I really, really do.

105
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,895
I...

106
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,598
It's...

107
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,832
Ten minutes, right?

108
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,001
Not a minute more!

109
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,208
Okay, I really gotta go.

110
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,310
Come on, Anne, please!
Don't fuck me!

111
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,372
I'm sorry, I just...
I booked a meeting for Alice

112
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,091
with this college
admissions rep that I know,

113
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,626
and she's only
in town for the night,

114
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,516
and it's a really
big opportunity.

115
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,418
Alice is like 16!

116
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,920
I mean, isn't college
a little far away?

117
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,833
I know, but after the shit
storm that we've been through,

118
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,202
we are focused on
the future in my house,

119
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,024
and nothing but the future.

120
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,260
Come on, please!

121
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,407
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
The meeting's around the corner.

122
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,841
I'll be at the gazebo
in time for the proposal.

123
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,009
Forty minutes!
An hour, max!

124
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,065
Set your phone alarm...!

125
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,269
Set your phone alarm!

126
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,938
Anne...

127
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,341
So, what're we feeling?
Negronis?

128
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,728
Eastern Royal University
has one of the best

129
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,485
psychiatry programs
in the world.

130
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,864
You only say that
'cause you went there.

131
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,155
I say it because it's true.

132
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,868
And knowing the head of
the program is a huge leg-up.

133
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,092
She can open
all kinds of doors...

134
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,039
which you deserve because
you're bright and articulate

135
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,664
and so full of potential.

136
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,900
So let's try to show that
side of you, for a change.

137
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,902
What does that mean?

138
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,148
Just that your grumpy
little face gives off

139
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:32,904
the wrong idea sometimes.

140
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,573
Mom!

141
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,508
What?
I have the same grumpy face.

142
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,154
It's hereditary, okay?
It's my gift to you.

143
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,279
- That is so mean!
- It's not mean!

144
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,514
Shh, shh, shh!
There she is, there she is.

145
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,682
Just be cool, be cool.

146
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,584
Just be cool.

147
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,187
Okay, 18 minutes.

148
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,722
Did we not agree on ten minutes?

149
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,691
Did we not agree on ten?

150
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:57,329
You agreed on ten minutes.

151
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,331
Fuck closure!
We're going to get Val.

152
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,677
Get your shit.
Come on, just bring the baby.

153
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,734
Okay, alright!

154
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,736
Where did she go?

155
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,205
Did she not say
they were stepping outside?

156
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,108
Honestly, this ladies night
is turning into a real bummer.

157
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,512
Ha-ha, good lord, check out
these bachelorette bitches!

158
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:20,519
I would not be caught
dead at a themed...

159
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,425
Paul?

160
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,427
Hey!

161
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,961
Kate!

162
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,930
Love the...
love the threads!

163
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,565
Moonlighting as a stripper?

164
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,335
Ha, no!
I'm too tall for that.

165
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,537
What are you doing
with all these women?

166
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,617
I thought you said you
were out with your friends!

167
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,718
Yeah, I'm out
with my friends from work.

168
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:42,841
From the clinic.

169
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,943
They're all female.

170
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,844
They are.

171
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,424
You remember what I do
for a living, right?

172
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:50,549
I'm just gonna...
try to text Val.

173
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,184
I'm sure this all makes sense.

174
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,532
Okay, look, I probably...
I probably should have told you

175
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,589
that it was a bachelorette,
but I just...

176
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,459
I really didn't want you
to feel weird about it.

177
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,993
But I do feel weird.

178
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,662
This is... weird.

179
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,564
Right?

180
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,367
So, technically,
I was right to think that.

181
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:12,170
Which is a totally valid
thing for you to think, but...

182
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,383
I know, is what I'm saying.

183
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,374
I know, and I'm sorry,

184
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,986
so we should just
go have a drink.

185
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,777
You should come
and join us, huh?

186
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,579
You should probably
come have a drink?

187
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,781
You can finally meet
the girls, please?

188
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,193
She would, but we're on
a bit of a tight schedule.

189
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,817
Well, schedule shmedule.

190
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,785
I need to see what
the fuck this is.

191
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,186
Yes!

192
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,389
What?
Sloane, no!

193
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,568
Twenty minutes.
I promise you, 20 minutes.

194
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,223
No!
Sloane!

195
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,292
Twenty.

196
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:37,295
Thanks, Kate!

197
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,398
Fuck!

198
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,633
Ugh...

199
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,604
Hey, man, everything okay?

200
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,216
We have a problem.

201
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,840
What?
What, uh, what happened?

202
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,208
Denise is threatening to sue me.

203
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,010
What?
What for?

204
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,623
I don't know.
Wrongful dismissal;

205
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,714
drug deficiencies
she's invented?

206
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,016
Our team drafted a counter-suit

207
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,829
and I'm nervous the press
will get their hands on it,

208
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,653
and I need to get
your eyes on it ASAP.

209
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah, okay, okay.
That makes sense.

210
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,056
Uh, just, uh,
email it over, okay,

211
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,836
and I'll look at it
as soon as I can.

212
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,727
Any way we could
meet up instead?

213
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,463
Well, it's just that, uh...
I-I'm on a...

214
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,809
I'm pretty tied up...

215
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,933
at the moment.

216
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,135
I'm on a manhunt for
a woman in the Beaches, so...

217
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,937
Beaches, okay, you know what?

218
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,239
I'm, uh, close by.
I-I'll come to you!

219
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,919
I really feel like
this could wait till tomorrow.

220
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,076
Hello?
Hello...

221
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,254
Those were tumultuous times,
you know?

222
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,557
I was overwhelmed.

223
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,437
The parent thing came
so easily to you, Val, but I...

224
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,761
I struggled from day one.

225
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,763
Oh, here we go!
You don't think I struggled?

226
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,298
No!

227
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,901
I wanted to step up too, Val,
to be a good father, alright?

228
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,548
But each year it just
got harder and harder.

229
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,472
Isn't that rich?

230
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,374
The sob story from
the runaway deadbeat dad!

231
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,110
I was a deadbeat, alright?
I was.

232
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,279
Puberty broke me.

233
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,659
You hit puberty years before
we had any children,

234
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:03,882
you... you...

235
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,884
I meant the boys' puberty.

236
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,987
Oh, right, yes.
Carry on.

237
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,589
They were animals.

238
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,324
You're right.
They were animals.

239
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,895
And you left me to housebreak
those two feral creatures alone!

240
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,475
You think they got better
after their dad left?

241
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,398
We were supposed to be a team.

242
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,733
I know.

243
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,502
I'm ashamed.

244
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,004
It's a little late for shame!

245
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:30,509
I know there's nothing I can say
to justify my actions.

246
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,812
I mean, I can barely stand
to look at my reflection

247
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,947
in the mirror
every morning, but...

248
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,316
if there's one thing
that lets me sleep at night,

249
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,519
it's been knowing
those boys are in good hands

250
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,722
because they have
the best mom in the world.

251
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,625
Well, I...

252
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,160
I suppose that's nice to hear.

253
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,948
So, it's an
incredibly competitive program,

254
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,372
but if you're anything
like your mother,

255
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,842
you have nothing to worry about.

256
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,777
Did you know she was
top of our class?

257
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,847
Stop!
I mean, I-I wasn't top.

258
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:09,959
I mean, I was pretty good.

259
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,984
I was.

260
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,053
Anyway, like I mentioned,

261
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,188
she still has a year
of high school to go,

262
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,935
but it's never too soon
to chart a path, right?

263
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,959
Oh, absolutely.

264
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,460
So, Alice,

265
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,173
your mother says that you share
her interest in psychiatry?

266
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,964
- I did.
- She does!

267
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,166
She does.
She absolutely does, yeah.

268
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,579
She actually worked
at my office for a while

269
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,870
and was quite gifted.

270
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,583
Some of my clients
even preferred talking to her!

271
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,574
Yeah,

272
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,609
and some actually
tried to come visit me at...

273
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,556
She's also... she's
so incredibly well-rounded.

274
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,479
She, um... she's in
an extra-curricular

275
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,481
- theatre group right now.
- Oh!

276
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,394
I'm just taking it
for the extra credit

277
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,963
so that I can
fast-track my diploma

278
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,419
and graduate this year.

279
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,221
Sorry, what?

280
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,568
Fast-tracking?
That's impressive.

281
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,291
Hello, high achiever here!

282
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,025
So we're thinking
about this September?

283
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,794
Wait, uh...

284
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,073
Well, I can't this September.

285
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,597
I'll be on the sheep farm.

286
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,798
Did you say "sheep farm"?

287
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,499
Alice...

288
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,034
are you on something right now?

289
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,703
I'm taking a gap year.

290
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,638
So, ladies,

291
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,507
we're circling back
to next September, then?

292
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,020
- No, you're not.
- In Australia.

293
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,510
Uh-uh, nope.

294
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,845
With Seamus.

295
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,814
What are you talking about?

296
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,316
Anyway, um...

297
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,452
I'm not sure when, or even if,

298
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,055
I'll be applying, but I'd love
to take a look at any materials

299
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,259
you might have.

300
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:33,431
Thank you so much.

301
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,333
You said I could take the car?

302
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,436
Keys?

303
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,140
Of course.

304
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,542
It was so nice meeting you.

305
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,288
Let me guess!

306
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,759
Four days premie, breech,
no fetal distress.

307
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,071
Wrong!

308
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,362
What?

309
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,142
Lindsey likes to try and guess
the baby's birth journey,

310
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,266
but you are wrong
this time, L-train,

311
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,769
uh, because little Owen here
was a week late,

312
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,871
induced,
occiput anterior position.

313
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,505
What, what, what, what, what?

314
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,275
Fuuuuuck me.

315
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,088
Okay, how about we, uh,
steer this conversation

316
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,779
away from my vagina?

317
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,081
Oh, you crashed my bachelorette.

318
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,360
We're gonna talk about your
vagina as much as I want!

319
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,785
No, no, Lindsey!

320
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,665
No, look, if Sloane doesn't want
us talking about her vagina,

321
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,789
we are not gonna
talk about your vagina!

322
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,869
Um... but I-I'll...
I'm gonna get drinks, drinks.

323
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,694
Yes, Paul, yes!
Yes!

324
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,497
Paulie, Paulie, Paulie, Paulie!

325
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,933
It's so nice to
finally meet you, Sloane!

326
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,135
Paul literally never
stops talking about you.

327
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,082
I know, it's, um...
it's annoying, really.

328
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,984
It's not annoying!
It's sweet.

329
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,385
Well, and now that
I'm finally seeing you,

330
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,743
I'm like "Whoop!"

331
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,589
Maybe someone else
will be a bride soon...

332
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,615
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

333
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,351
I dunno, I can tell
by the way he looks at you.

334
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,598
Who knows, maybe he'll even make
it down the aisle this time!

335
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,155
Please God!

336
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,357
This time?

337
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,104
Don't worry about her.
She's crazy, she's crazy.

338
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,629
I'm not crazy!
I am not crazy.

339
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,209
You are way cooler
than Charlotte.

340
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,033
She was...

341
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,836
Turdsville.

342
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,438
Charlotte...
Wait, uh, what happened?

343
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,741
It was this whole thing.
Very messy engagement.

344
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,575
It was!

345
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,544
Okay, I have
no idea what I got here.

346
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,124
I just told them
something fun and sailor-y!

347
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,580
Yes!
Woo!

348
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,352
Okay...

349
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,254
You know what, uh, Paulie,

350
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,588
enjoy your girlfriends.

351
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,657
What?

352
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,659
I really like her.
She is the best!

353
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,361
You guys are cute together.

354
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,941
You're in trouble!

355
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,765
Sloane!

356
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,577
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

357
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,468
Where am I going?

358
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,370
You were engaged!

359
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,805
You didn't think to tell me?

360
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,807
Wait, what... what'd they say?

361
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,386
This... this is classic Lindsey,
by the way.

362
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,179
This isn't funny!

363
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,214
I was 22 years old.

364
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,483
It was stupid and over
within three months.

365
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,186
I wasn't hiding it.
It just never seemed relevant!

366
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,866
It's a pretty significant thing
to seem irrelevant.

367
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,389
Is it?

368
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,191
We both have our
dating histories.

369
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,192
You've got all
your meatballs stories.

370
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,194
Boys!
Meatboys!

371
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,797
Oh... that makes more sense.

372
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,599
Yeah, and it's a big difference.
I told you about those guys!

373
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,203
Look, it was so long ago.

374
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,118
It's just got nothing
to do with who I am.

375
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,240
But that's the problem.

376
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,642
'Cause we're supposed to be
moving in together,

377
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,889
and I'm realizing right now
that I have no fucking clue

378
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,813
who you are!

379
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,592
You know who I am.

380
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,016
Yeah, see, this is great?

381
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,451
Do you see what you did?
Perfect.

382
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,453
Have fun with your girls.

383
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,856
Sloane, hold on!

384
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,012
Yeah, I mean, this is
a really well-crafted statement.

385
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,635
-Good.

386
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,048
-You did a terrific job
with this.

387
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,638
- Good, that's good.
- Yeah.

388
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,273
-So the lawyers
were right, then.

389
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,242
-You already ran it
by your lawyers?

390
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,879
- Yes.
- Okay.

391
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,148
-What?

392
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,483
-Well, I just... I mean,
here I am desperately trying

393
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,730
not to ruin my friend's proposal
and I'm being sidetracked

394
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,956
because you desperately
need my eyes on something

395
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,235
that you've already got
your lawyers' sign-off on...?

396
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,259
Come on!

397
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,139
-I, just... you know,
I trust your opinion more.

398
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,463
-Than lawyers'?

399
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,618
Well, that's just questionable
judgement on your part.

400
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,303
-Alright, fine.
Maybe I needed the distraction.

401
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,505
-Okay.

402
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,452
-Full disclosure,
I had to get out of the house.

403
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,077
My wife and I...

404
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,079
are in a rocky place right now.

405
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,580
Ah.
I have, uh...

406
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,582
I have been to that rocky place.

407
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,917
How'd you handle it?

408
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,785
So good.

409
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,298
Like a lunatic.
I lost my mind.

410
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:53,391
- No, not you!
- Uh-huh.

411
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,327
I dunno, I feel like
those rough patches,

412
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,974
they're also opportunities,
right, to see what you want,

413
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,498
and go after it, you know?

414
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,206
Anyway...

415
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,009
I'm, uh,
I'm sorry about your wife.

416
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:15,346
Yeah, thanks.

417
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,715
And I have got
eight minutes to find Val.

418
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,417
This proposal
is officially ruined.

419
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,819
Well, hang on.
Uh...

420
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,956
Val is your blonde friend,
right, about yay high, huge ass?

421
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,157
That is correct.

422
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,025
Is that her?

423
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,560
Where?

424
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,931
Oh my...

425
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,432
Val!

426
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,967
No!
No, I wasn't doing it!

427
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,235
I... I wasn't!

428
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,544
Val, Val, Val, Val,
what the hell are you doing?

429
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,846
I don't know.

430
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,726
I've just got all these
weird feelings bubbling in me.

431
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,250
And what with Mel cheating...

432
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,953
He's not cheating, Val.

433
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,187
He's proposing!

434
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,855
What?!

435
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,790
That's why
he's been so secretive.

436
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,792
He's got this beautiful
surprise proposal,

437
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,039
and it's all going down
in the gazebo in...

438
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,963
two minutes.

439
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,998
None of my business,
but if you gun it,

440
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,577
the gazebo's like
a minute and a half that way.

441
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,467
- Oh, well, I'm sure...
- Ooh!

442
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,002
Oh!

443
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,071
I'm coming, my love!

444
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,973
Hey, uh, get that statement out!

445
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,008
It looks great, okay?
See ya!

446
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,614
Oh my God...
There he is.

447
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,983
We made it.

448
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,018
I can't believe it.

449
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,988
Look how handsome he looks.

450
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,590
Well, I made it.
I hope you're happy.

451
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,370
Let's just get
this show on the road.

452
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,871
Owen needed a change
40 minutes ago.

453
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,295
Jesus, what happened to you two?

454
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,896
- Ugh...
- Okay...

455
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,002
- Mel!
- Hey.

456
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,703
What is all this?

457
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,706
Val...

458
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,443
For years, I never thought
I'd find the right person,

459
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,046
and then I met you.

460
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,848
It was like an angel had drifted
from the heavens just for me.

461
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,724
And so...
Aww...

462
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:10,661
I know I'd have to be
an absolute fool not to ask...

463
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,863
Val Szalinsky, will you...

464
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,132
Marry me!

465
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,333
What?

466
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,934
Oh, no.

467
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,337
- This isn't good.
- No, it is not.

468
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,616
Well, maybe
not marry me right away.

469
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,340
It's, uh...

470
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,342
We should take it slow
this time around,

471
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,821
you know, really set
ourselves up for success.

472
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,245
Okay, wait, who is this guy?

473
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,747
My... ex-husband.

474
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,550
Wait, the guy who left you?

475
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,884
I know, I know, I know.

476
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:34,953
It's not the best timing.

477
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,055
Ya think?

478
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,334
It's just, I thought
I could walk out that door

479
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:41,259
and forget about us.

480
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,871
But if there's one thing
that kiss showed me...

481
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,495
Wait, I'm sorry.
Uh, kiss?

482
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,099
Did he say "kiss"?

483
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,867
Oh, yeah...

484
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,701
- Was there a kiss?
- There was a kiss?

485
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,103
There was, yeah.

486
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,172
But Val, Val!

487
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,706
We belong together.

488
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:59,310
So, whaddya say?

489
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,579
You wanna give this thing
the shot it deserves?

490
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,386
No!

491
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,687
What?

492
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,489
Absolutely not!

493
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,892
Huh...
Okay.

494
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,094
Because...

495
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,695
Wow.
Wow.

496
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,397
You know what?

497
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,798
Fuck you.

498
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,200
Big fuck you.

499
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,934
You know, I poured my heart out,

500
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,181
and this is the shit
I get in return?

501
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,137
Then fuck you!

502
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,505
Whoa...

503
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,820
Fuck you!
Big fuck you!

504
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,541
Fuckin'...

505
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,809
Fuckin' shit!

506
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,289
Stupid fuckin'... ow, fuck!

507
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,313
My toe!

508
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:39,117
Mel...!

509
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,352
Mel...

510
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,222
You know that the kiss,
it wasn't anything, really.

511
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,157
Val.

512
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,959
I think I just need to be alone.

513
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,128
Oh...

514
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,936
Maybe I don't deserve love.

515
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,771
Maybe I'm not meant
for nice things.

516
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Of course you are.
You're...

517
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,019
You deserve all the nice things.

518
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,943
You totally are!

519
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,546
I obviously have
some self-reflecting to do.

520
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,647
Excuse me, ladies.

521
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,353
Well, I think that's my cue.

522
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,587
Yeah.

523
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,856
Later.
Let's go.

524
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,591
Bye!

525
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,362
Okay, okay...

526
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,164
I should probably go.

527
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:26,797
Make sure Alice hasn't
fled the country.

528
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,366
What?

529
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,045
- I'll fill you in later.
- Oh, boy.

530
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,471
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

531
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,610
Hey.

532
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,180
Hey, you're still here!

533
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,059
Well, I was trying to give
you guys some space, and...

534
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,816
like I said,
I needed the distraction.

535
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,419
Oh, you certainly got that!

536
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,821
That was...
an absolute shitshow.

537
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,590
Definition of a shitshow.

538
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,069
Honestly,
I feel for your friend.

539
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,627
Oh, I know.
Me too.

540
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,429
Val's a lot, but she's, uh...

541
00:19:58,498 --> 00:19:59,498
she's also the best.

542
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,399
Oh, sure, yes.

543
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,078
I mean, sometimes,
you know, you just...

544
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:03,834
you get carried away
in the moment.

545
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,904
It happens.

546
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,506
Totally.

547
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:16,013
You know who I feel for?

548
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,416
It's all these dead flowers,
you know?

549
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,017
Why did they die?

550
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,197
Why did they have
to die in vain?

551
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,820
Imagine their parents.

552
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:23,721
Soon you gotta
think about their...

553
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,624
their families.

554
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,036
That's the dumbest thing
you've ever said.

555
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,461
Well, buckle up!

556
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,640
'Cause when it comes
to flower families,

557
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,930
I have a lot to say...

558
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,112
Good God, please just stop.

559
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,069
But also, thank you,
'cause I needed this.

560
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,940
Oh...

561
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,644
And also, I'm sorry
for wasting your time today.

562
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,679
Oh, it's cool.

563
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,125
Yeah, I...
I dunno, I just...

564
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,482
I just like being around you.

565
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,484
I like being around you.

566
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,231
Which is good,
since we work together.

567
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,288
It's easy,
'cause we can just hang...

568
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:07,097
Oh...
