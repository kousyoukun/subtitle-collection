1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,524
Because I love you, you idiot.

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:04,874
<i>'Cause I love you too.</i>

3
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:09,834
Davia suggested that I
take one of those DNA tests.

4
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:11,271
<i>I mean, what if I find someone</i>

5
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,881
that could have taken
me in after my parents died

6
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:14,187
but just didn't?

7
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:16,058
I found money in
my discretionary fund

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,407
to build the women's center.

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,540
<i>What about the encampment?</i>

10
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,932
<i>The mayor ordered the sweep.</i>

11
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,630
I can't go over his head.

12
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,414
<i>If you won't
do anything, then I will.</i>

13
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:29,202
I'm Councilwoman Lucia Morales,

14
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:31,378
and I did not
authorize this sweep.

15
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,944
<i>Jazmin and Spencer</i>

16
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,555
<i>are willing to
co-parent with me,</i>

17
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:35,947
<i>so our baby will have</i>

18
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:37,732
the love and support
of three parents.

19
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,255
I would be very happy

20
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,084
for you and Spencer
to adopt our baby.

21
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,522
I think I changed my mind.

22
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:47,307
<i>Welcome to the farm, Mariana.</i>

23
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:48,265
It's nice to meet you.

24
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,657
It's nice to meet you too.

25
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:50,832
She's missing?

26
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:51,747
You really think
she'd go to this farm

27
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:53,269
<i>without telling anyone?</i>

28
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,531
I'm a friend of Joaquin's.

29
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,837
<i>I think Jenna is in a cult.</i>

30
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,099
I wanna leave.

31
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,100
I will get her back safely.

32
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,754
I need you to stay with the car

33
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,321
<i>and just be ready to get away.</i>

34
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:02,410
Joaquin!

35
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:04,846
Hey!

36
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:06,457
All right, come on. Come on.

37
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:08,284
Run!

38
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,029
Stop! I said stop!

39
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:21,777
Stop! I said stop!

40
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:23,648
Don't shoot!

41
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:50,197
Evan!

42
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,461
Oh, my God!

43
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:55,679
Oh, shit.

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,116
- Oh, my God!
- All right.

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,639
You're... You're
okay. You're okay.

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,685
What did you do? Damn it!

47
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,168
- Here, here, put pressure on it with this.
- Okay.

48
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,910
What happened? Is someone hurt?

49
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,954
Get away from us, man!

50
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,130
I told him not to shoot!

51
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,741
Go, before I beat
the shit out of you!

52
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:25,666
Jenna. Jenna, go get my truck.

53
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,102
- Where?
- It's over there behind the trees.

54
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,148
- Okay.
- Hurry.

55
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,803
No, no. No, no. Don't...
Don't try to speak.

56
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,327
We need to call an ambulance!

57
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,677
We don't have time for an
ambulance to get out here.

58
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:38,287
You're gonna be
okay. We're gonna get some help.

59
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:41,160
We're gonna take you to
hospital. You're gonna be fine.

60
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,466
All right. We... We
gotta get him in the truck.

61
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,990
- Here, here. Grab his legs.
- Okay.

62
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,209
- Jenna, grab his other leg.
- Okay, I got it.

63
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,645
All right.
Up, up, here we go.

64
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:51,213
Get under... Get under
him. Careful. Careful.

65
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,563
All right.

66
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:55,262
Here we go. Alright, alright.

67
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,221
Quick, quick. Easy.

68
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,902
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

69
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,419
Find the closest emergency room.

70
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,887
Slow
down. He can't take it.

71
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,105
Keep pressure on it.

72
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,806
Just hang on, Evan, please.

73
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,024
Please, just don't
go to sleep, okay?

74
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,025
Don't go to sleep.

75
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:05,157
- She's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:30,094
I'm sorry,

77
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:33,446
for any pain that I
may have caused

78
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,362
by deciding to
keep the baby, but...

79
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:40,149
I just... I hope you
can understand.

80
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,109
Of course, we do.

81
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,418
Here you go.

82
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:52,029
Thank you.

83
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,509
Hi, my love.

84
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,816
So, have you
thought of a name yet?

85
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,081
I was thinking...

86
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:01,996
maybe we could call her Lyric.

87
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:05,391
- - Oh.
- Oh, you don't like this.

88
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:08,785
It's okay.

89
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,353
If that's okay with you.

90
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,660
- Lyric.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,750
Yeah, that's a pretty name.

92
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
It's lovely.

93
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:38,816
So how do you feel about
Isabella changing her mind?

94
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:43,603
I feel totally blindsided.

95
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:46,301
Like she's... she's
all over the place.

96
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,433
I mean, she was so sure

97
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,435
that she wasn't
ready to be a mother.

98
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,784
I mean, she convinced me.

99
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,046
And I'm still convinced

100
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:55,571
that she's not capable
of raising our baby.

101
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,400
And I think that once
the rush of emotions pass,

102
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,663
maybe she'll realize that.

103
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,972
Oh, God. I'm...
I'm so sorry, guys.

104
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,887
I... I know this is
hard for you too.

105
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:08,454
Hey, hey, no.

106
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:11,195
We're more worried about you.

107
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:14,329
I mean, this has been
such a roller coaster.

108
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,767
We're here for you and the
baby, no matter what, man.

109
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,183
Thanks, man. I appreciate that.

110
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,206
Come here.

111
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,692
I'll see you guys.

112
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,691
Mmm. You're gonna fall off.

113
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,519
Okay. That's too far.

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,522
Hey, when are we gonna
tell everyone about us?

115
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:17,958
Should we? They all think

116
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,961
Coterie relationships
are doomed.

117
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,009
<i>Maybe we could sneak
around for a while.</i>

118
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,316
That could be fun.

119
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,231
I say we tell 'em.

120
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,668
I think they'll be happy for us.

121
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,237
I know I'm happy for us.

122
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:46,639
Oh. Round three?

123
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,770
Nice work, old man.

124
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,077
Hey, I prefer experienced.

125
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,080
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

126
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,651
Why didn't she take me
in after my parents died?

127
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,870
Why'd... Why'd she leave
me in the foster system?

128
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,264
She obviously never
gave a shit about me.

129
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,526
Who's the idiot
who's missing out

130
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,137
on the joy of giving
a shit about you?

131
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,923
Luca got his DNA results.

132
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,578
He has an aunt.

133
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,755
Oh! Okay, well, she sucks.

134
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,800
But isn't this why
you took that test?

135
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,149
So that you could find someone

136
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,281
who could help you
get your birth certificate?

137
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,587
So you can get an ID.

138
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,154
And start working.
Maybe even as a dancer.

139
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:27,244
Morning. I'm starving.

140
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:28,812
Me too.

141
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,683
Mm-hmm.

142
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,467
I just feel like you're
not telling me something.

143
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:17,730
Will you stop?

144
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,254
- Just take the meeting.
- What meeting?

145
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:23,300
I got Alice a meeting
for a writing job

146
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,259
on a TV show.

147
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,738
- Oh, okay!
- Ooh, fun!

148
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,174
Yeah, but I'm a comic.

149
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,567
And it's a comedy.

150
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,959
A lot of comedians
got their start

151
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,265
writing on a show

152
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,833
like Mindy Kaling and
Conan O'Brien and...

153
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,922
Oh, the baby!

154
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:39,186
Oh, my gosh!

155
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,927
How did she sleep?

156
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,319
Like a champ.

157
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,234
Today's her first
doctor appointment.

158
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,673
Oh, I just love her little hat.

159
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,372
Gooshi-gooshi-goo!

160
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,853
Oh, I'm a natural.

161
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,904
Oh, shit!

162
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:02,993
What happened to you?

163
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,219
He's stable,

164
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,397
um, but they had
to put him in a coma

165
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,921
because he had
a bunch of strokes

166
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:22,708
and there's some
swelling in his brain.

167
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:23,709
But they're gonna move him

168
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,015
to a better hospital near here.

169
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,104
Does he have any family?

170
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,933
Just his sister, but
she's in London.

171
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,675
What do the police say?

172
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,330
Um, they, uh... They
interviewed us at the hospital.

173
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,201
I assume now they're
heading to the farm

174
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,334
to arrest Adam and Silas,

175
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,250
unless they're
already on the run.

176
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,339
BP 84 over 47.

177
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,427
Is he gonna be okay?

178
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:47,471
He's lost a lot of blood.

179
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:48,560
We'll do everything we can.

180
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,871
What the hell was Evan
doing at the farm, anyway?

181
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,051
Hey.

182
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
How are you holding up?

183
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,189
I'm just

184
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,582
really worried about Evan.

185
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,674
I should get to the hospital.

186
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,546
I'm the only one that they're
letting in to see him, so.

187
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,896
Well, is there
anything we can do?

188
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,769
Yeah. Yeah, how can we help?

189
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,727
Thanks. But, um,

190
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,209
just knowing that you're
all here is everything.

191
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,696
Hey, do you think
Evan's gonna make it?

192
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:41,090
Um... I don't know.

193
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,927
<i>You've
reached Callie Adams Foster.</i>

194
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,016
<i>I can't get to the
phone right now.</i>

195
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:39,759
<i>Uh, if this is work-related,
you can reach me...</i>

196
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:55,730
Hey, Malika.

197
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:58,646
Hey, there she is.

198
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,476
Our little sweep
stopper extraordinaire.

199
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,959
Well, thank you.

200
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,353
But all the credit
goes to Lucia.

201
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,667
Thank you.

202
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:22,496
Besides the fact that
we pissed off the mayor,

203
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,019
the feedback from
our constituents

204
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,587
has been
overwhelmingly positive.

205
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:30,330
But I can't stop the sweeps
from happening indefinitely.

206
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,853
We need to find housing

207
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,507
for the people of
the encampment.

208
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,118
Let's reach out to all
the support agencies

209
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,685
and see if we can get
them to partner with us

210
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,426
on a solution, okay?

211
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:40,602
Let's get this done.

212
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,694
Lucia.

213
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,176
I have an idea.

214
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,746
What if we use your
discretionary funds

215
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,227
to buy that apartment building?

216
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,447
Is there still a
deal to be made?

217
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,883
Well, I don't see why not.

218
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,363
It's just sitting there empty.

219
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:05,582
And I think it would get

220
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,541
a lot of positive press for you,

221
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,109
tangibly making a
difference in their lives

222
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,502
by using your own funds
to address this crisis

223
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,722
with a housing first model.

224
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,203
It's not a bad idea.

225
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,120
Or, you know, I mean, is it?

226
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:22,730
What about the women's center?

227
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:25,080
We go back to
trying to get it funded

228
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,255
through the city council.

229
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,649
It's still extremely
important to me,

230
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,390
but the first priority

231
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,044
is to house the people
of the encampment

232
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,481
before they're swept out.

233
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,223
I...

234
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:40,356
admire you being
willing to do that, Malika.

235
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:41,837
Thank you.

236
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,450
How would you like to be my
new Deputy Policy Director?

237
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:48,930
Deputy Policy Director?

238
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,237
That's a big promotion.

239
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,499
It... It certainly is.

240
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,935
Uh, maybe we should take a beat.

241
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,763
You have good instincts

242
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,460
about where the
voters' priorities lie.

243
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,636
I'm... I'm very flattered,

244
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,726
and I'm definitely interested.

245
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,602
But can I just take a
day to think it over?

246
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,255
Of course.

247
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,914
Okay. Thank you.

248
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,309
A day to think it over?

249
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,486
Uh, I wish I'd had a day
to think it over, you know,

250
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,835
or even a heads-up
would have been nice.

251
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,141
I didn't want to debate.

252
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,187
Malika works hard.

253
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,232
And what about everyone
else who works hard

254
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,320
and have been here longer?

255
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,974
No one else on
staff cares as much

256
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,195
or puts in the hours
that Malika does.

257
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,849
It won't be a problem.

258
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,353
You okay?

259
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,094
Yeah.

260
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:09,707
Just... Just tired.

261
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:16,931
Oh, my God.

262
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,981
Oh, no, little one. Come here.

263
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,985
Oh, yes.

264
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,291
Ah, yes, Daddy's got you.

265
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,642
It's okay. It's okay.

266
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,217
So...

267
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:45,090
what do you think
that she should call us?

268
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:48,354
There's... Mommy and Daddy,

269
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,008
Mama and Papa.

270
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,793
What about Big Poppy
G and Mama Izz?

271
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,541
I like Mama and Papa.

272
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,024
Me too.

273
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,551
Yeah, you like that
too? Mama and Papa?

274
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,904
Here we go! One, two, hup!

275
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,319
Pretty awesome, huh?

276
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,061
Oh. Yeah, they're...

277
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,887
They're amazing.

278
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:46,195
I'm Yaddy. I manage the place.

279
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,457
Luca.

280
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,852
I seen you here a lot,
watching the classes.

281
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,335
You a dancer?

282
00:17:56,336 --> 00:18:00,774
Yeah. I mean, I, uh, I wanna be.

283
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:01,992
Why don't you come
on in and take a class?

284
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,082
What do you got to lose?

285
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,607
I just can't, uh,

286
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:08,608
can't really afford it.

287
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,697
I'm in between jobs.

288
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,177
I'm actually looking
for a little extra help

289
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,482
at the front desk.

290
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,243
You should come on in
and get an application.

291
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:16,964
Come on.

292
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,550
<i>"America's Funniest
Ferrets Friends"</i>?

293
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,727
Hey. Hey,
you in the hallway.

294
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:41,815
Are you here with lunch?

295
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,469
- Uh...
- With lunch?

296
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,774
Um, no.

297
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,603
No, we can't hear you.
C... Come on. Come in.

298
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,779
Yeah? Where's the lunch?

299
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,477
I'm not here with lunch.

300
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:53,174
I'm here for the
new writer interview.

301
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,308
Oh, yeah. That was
the network's idea.

302
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,223
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Alice.

303
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,659
Uh, what have you worked on?

304
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,270
Well, I've never written
on a TV show before.

305
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,619
Oh.

306
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,012
I'm a stand-up comic.

307
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,579
I just opened for Margaret Cho.

308
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,581
Is that the horny one?
Always has a bun in the oven.

309
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:09,973
No, that's Ali Wong.

310
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,845
- Margaret Cho, used to be the lesbian.
- Right.

311
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,413
Hey, mixing up Asian
comics is not cool.

312
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,198
What if I confused
the three of you?

313
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,462
Maybe not the best example.

314
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,073
No, no, no.
You're actually right.

315
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,859
We need some woking up.

316
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,382
Are you familiar with the show?

317
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:28,601
Uh, not really.

318
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,038
All right. Watch this.

319
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,568
I got it. There must be a
treat in here somewheres.

320
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,091
I'll ferret it out,

321
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,617
even if I have to work
from desk till dawn.

322
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,401
- That's good, Morrie.
- That's funny.

323
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:48,447
- Yeah, so write that down.
- You write it down.

324
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,275
I'm not your secretary.
You see boobs here?

325
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,493
As a matter of fact, I do.

326
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,192
I think I'll get you
a bra for Christmas.

327
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,063
Here. Write it down.

328
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,241
Uh, I haven't
actually taken the job.

329
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,766
You haven't actually
been offered the job.

330
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,248
Come on. Where are our manners?

331
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,511
I am Morty. This is Murray.

332
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:10,512
That's Morrie.

333
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,385
Morty, Murray, Morrie?

334
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,952
And now, your turn.

335
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,092
Edna, this is the last time

336
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:28,270
you talk me into going
on a giant ferret safari.

337
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,711
Oh.

338
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:36,930
Morrie, what's wrong?

339
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,280
I told you that leftover
pastrami was old.

340
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,499
I think I'm
having a heart attack.

341
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,891
What? Should I
call an ambulance?

342
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,328
No, just wait a minute.

343
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,764
Okay, but I could be dying here!

344
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:45,765
He could be dying here.

345
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,941
No. No.

346
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:53,600
False alarm.

347
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:55,296
Ohhhh.

348
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,602
That's pastrami, all right.

349
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,343
Take your medicine.

350
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,258
Could you spray a little of
that around the room, hon?

351
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,955
Eat like a human being!

352
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,609
I'm trying
to. It's pastrami, I like it.

353
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,088
You can't
shovel that in your mouth.

354
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:08,178
- How many times have I told you?
- Oh, not on me. Come on.

355
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,051
- I'm not you.
- This is a thing.

356
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,452
- But I think she'll be fine.
- Hey.

357
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,490
Hey, what're y'all doing here?

358
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,665
Wait, is something wrong?

359
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,972
No, we were just,
um, grabbing a drink

360
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,365
and we thought we'd stop by.

361
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,496
Yeah, to chat.

362
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,019
You know, casual, like,

363
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,108
"Hey, girl, what's up with you?"

364
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:27,634
Well, not that casual.

365
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:29,983
What's going on?

366
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,813
Well, you know Dom.

367
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:36,163
My brother? Yes,
I know my brother.

368
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,164
Is he okay?

369
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,731
Oh, yeah. No, he's fine.

370
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,862
No, he isn't.

371
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,255
Did something
happen? Is he hurt?

372
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,257
- Well, yes.
- What?

373
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:45,520
- Well, no, not... not physically, no.
- Oh, my God.

374
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,436
Okay, listen, see, he was
seeing someone, right?

375
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,698
And he was so in love.

376
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,657
Like, Lika, it was so damn cute.

377
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:52,658
You know what I'm saying?

378
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,486
Okay. I'm getting there, dang!

379
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:58,360
Um, but they broke up,
and there's some issues.

380
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,581
And he's kind of taking it hard.

381
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:03,843
Hard?

382
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,019
Lika, he was
crying, heartbroken,

383
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,455
like big baby boy tears.

384
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:08,587
It was sad.

385
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:09,849
Girl, I told you
that in confidence.

386
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,024
Okay. Well, I think
that's important

387
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,025
for her to know,
don't you think?

388
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,113
You can't be leaving stuff out.

389
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,419
Okay, thank you.

390
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,856
Anyway...
We were thinking

391
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:19,685
that he could use some
support from his sister.

392
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,383
Wait, how do y'all know
he has a broken heart?

393
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,995
This one's all yours.

394
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,912
Because I'm kind of
the one who broke it.

395
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:32,001
What?

396
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,699
Wait, you were
dating my brother?

397
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,397
Just for, like, three months.

398
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,747
Three months? How
did I not know this?

399
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,314
Well, I've been
trying to tell you,

400
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:41,794
but you keep canceling plans.

401
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,317
Okay, yes. And you have
been doing that a lot lately.

402
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:46,276
Okay, well, why
didn't Dom tell me?

403
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,062
We agreed that I should tell you

404
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,020
as your friend.

405
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,066
Friend.

406
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,284
Hmm.

407
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,243
Why the hell you out here
breaking my brother's heart?

408
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,549
See, that's what I'm sayin'.

409
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,289
'Cause, you know, your
brother is foine.

410
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,987
Okay. Way to have my back!

411
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:03,337
I do have your back.
I'm standing here.

412
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:05,905
- But you're taking his side.
- I could've let you do this by yourself.

413
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,081
I could be at home with my
man, getting my feet rubbed.

414
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,922
But you're
making it worse than it is.

415
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,796
W... What is it?

416
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,450
Just a bubble in his IV.

417
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,131
Nothing to worry about.

418
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,067
How is he doing?

419
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,026
He's hanging in there.

420
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,984
Time is really what will tell.

421
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:45,554
But his vitals remain
stable, so... that's good.

422
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,305
I'm so sorry.

423
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,961
This is all my fault.

424
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,002
Why did you go to
the farm in the first place?

425
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,664
I wanted to tell Jenna

426
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,797
that Silas wasn't who
she thought he was.

427
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,494
But you had to know
that it was dangerous.

428
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,844
It didn't seem dangerous.

429
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,150
I thought I was
just going for dinner.

430
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,152
And yet, you got there,
had no cell reception,

431
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,415
and decided to stay the night?

432
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,505
Didn't you think that people
would be worried about you?

433
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,551
I didn't think it all
the way through.

434
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,771
I wanted to help Joaquin.

435
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,600
Oh. Joaquin.

436
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,596
So that's what this
all comes down to...

437
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:36,778
again.

438
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,156
I had no idea that
Isabella decided

439
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,071
she couldn't be a
mother to the baby.

440
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,117
And now she's changed her mind?

441
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:13,032
Uh, what're you gonna do?

442
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,121
I don't know.

443
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,470
I mean,

444
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,386
she's been so good
with Lyric, so natural,

445
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,561
and I'm just thinking

446
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,608
maybe she got
scared before the birth.

447
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,568
Except Isabella has a
pattern of erratic behavior

448
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,570
even before she was
pregnant. I mean, what happens

449
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,572
if she does something
impulsive again?

450
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:32,660
What am I supposed to do?

451
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,097
Take the baby away from her?

452
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:39,014
I think you have a kind
and compassionate heart,

453
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,276
but she's gonna
keep acting crazy

454
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:41,539
and taking advantage of you.

455
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,280
I know you don't like
her. You never have.

456
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,631
But she's not crazy.

457
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,590
Okay. I'm sorry.

458
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,200
I... I didn't mean
to be insensitive.

459
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:53,552
I've got to get back
to her and the baby.

460
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,250
Hey.

461
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:58,817
Mm.

462
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,036
I know how much you love Gael,

463
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,429
but we gotta let
him follow his heart

464
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,084
and make his own choices.

465
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,086
Yeah.

466
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:10,045
Maybe we shouldn't
tell anybody about us yet.

467
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,047
So much is going on.

468
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,875
It just feels a little
weird to be like,

469
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,269
"Hey, we know everyone's
life sucks right now,

470
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,576
but we're in love."

471
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:20,621
Yeah.

472
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,580
And it could really
damage my reputation

473
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,495
as the resident Coterie sad boy.

474
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,593
- You know...
- Hmm?

475
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,247
We've never had sex in my loft.

476
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:39,467
Let's fix that.

477
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:41,687
Hmm.

478
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:49,537
Ah, Dennis.
Dennis. Dennis.

479
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,513
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:13,256
I have something to confess.

481
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,477
My heart skipped a beat

482
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:19,436
when I saw you
walking up to the protest.

483
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:21,524
Oh, yeah?

484
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,004
I've really missed you.

485
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,311
And...

486
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:26,922
I've been thinking...

487
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,534
I mean, what if I agreed
to be monogamous

488
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,276
while we see
where this is going?

489
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,888
We haven't dated long.

490
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,759
I'm not opposed to monogamy,

491
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,589
if this is a forever thing.

492
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:45,027
Wow.

493
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:50,553
I... did not expect
to hear that from you.

494
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:52,947
Yeah, I've been trying,

495
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:56,560
but... I don't want
to get over you.

496
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,867
I love hearing that.

497
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:02,828
And I'm all for supporting
the good work that you do.

498
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,179
I don't think you have time

499
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,486
for the kind of
relationship I'm looking for.

500
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,059
I still wanna be in your life

501
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,670
as a friend.

502
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,066
Yeah.

503
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,380
My favorite regular.

504
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,295
I bet you say
that to all the girls.

505
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,470
Not all of 'em.

506
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:39,428
Mm, just me, huh?

507
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:40,429
Hey, stranger.

508
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:42,475
Heyyy.

509
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:43,694
Do you know Dom's my brother?

510
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,261
Yeah, he told me.

511
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:48,307
Well, I didn't know you were
picking up shifts here again.

512
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,004
Good thing I check your socials.

513
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,441
Well, yeah, it's been a minute.

514
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,007
It has,

515
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,227
which is why I
wanted to come by,

516
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,924
you know, catch up.

517
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,535
So how you been?

518
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,800
I'm good. Can't complain.

519
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:05,151
So...

520
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:10,938
I didn't know you
and Kendi broke up.

521
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,202
Or that you were
even dating at all.

522
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,031
Yeah, uh...

523
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,772
I was gonna tell you.

524
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,253
I'm just sorry I
wasn't here for you.

525
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:22,123
It's okay.

526
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,084
I'm okay-ish.

527
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:30,653
But, you know, Dad, uh, he
gave me some pretty good advice.

528
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:32,830
And he also gave me some
pretty bad advice too, so.

529
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,266
Wait a minute.

530
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,355
You were talking to Dad
about your relationships?

531
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,923
Yeah. I mean, he's
too busy for me as well

532
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,881
'cause he got a new girlfriend.

533
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,492
- Wait, Dad has a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

534
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,408
- Since when?
- Since for a while now.

535
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,759
Okay, where have I been
for the last three months?

536
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:50,717
Busy.

537
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:52,676
Saving the world.

538
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:55,636
Oh, I'll be right back.

539
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,170
Hey.

540
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,785
I know you're mad at me.

541
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:16,917
I mean, you probably
even hate me.

542
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:17,918
I wouldn't blame you.

543
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,056
But you gotta... You
gotta eat something.

544
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,239
God, I should've never let
Evan come to the farm with me.

545
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,414
This is all my fault.

546
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,634
I'm so, so sorry.

547
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,209
No, I'm sorry.

548
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,950
I'm the one who
went to that farm

549
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,083
without telling anyone.

550
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,174
The fault's all on me.

551
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:59,003
I'm responsible
for him lying in there

552
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,221
and fighting for his life.

553
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:01,440
Hey. No. That's not true.

554
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,920
That's not true. Come on.

555
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,358
How could you be responsible
for some nut shooting...

556
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,621
shooting at us?

557
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,537
Okay, the only person
to blame here is Adam

558
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:12,669
and Silas.

559
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:15,715
Yeah, but if I hadn't
gone out there,

560
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,673
none of this would've happened.

561
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,545
No, no, please.

562
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,722
Hey, don't do this to yourself.

563
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,954
When we were
driving out to the farm,

564
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
um...

565
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:41,785
I told Evan that we weren't
seeing each other anymore,

566
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:47,139
because you thought you
still might have feelings for him.

567
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,969
I... I don't know if that, you
know, makes any difference.

568
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,232
I just thought you should know.

569
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:04,546
I'm not taking the job.

570
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,679
Everybody has to
start somewhere.

571
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,638
The idea is to get
your foot in the door.

572
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,727
Sumi wants me
to take a writing job

573
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,903
for <i>America's Funniest
Ferrets Friends.</i>

574
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:16,384
Oh, my
God! I love that show!

575
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:17,820
- See?
- Yes.

576
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,953
No, I'm not writing ferret jokes

577
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,737
with a bunch of
belching old men.

578
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:22,825
Why the hell not?

579
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,871
Because I opened
for Margaret Cho,

580
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:27,221
and I shouldn't have to
start from the bottom again.

581
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,441
But you never really
started at the bottom, Alice.

582
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:31,530
You sort of jumped
right to the top.

583
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,619
That's showbiz, kid.

584
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,449
Fine, but how long do
I have to pay my dues?

585
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,147
As long as it takes.

586
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,584
I mean, just the
opportunity itself

587
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,457
is hard to come by
for a lot of people.

588
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:49,069
- I just want a job that I love.
- I learned in my corporate job,

589
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,723
sometimes you have to
take something you don't love

590
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:52,290
and turn it into
something you do.

591
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,770
Just like I do
with all you guys.

592
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,598
Wait, I thought
you were miserable

593
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,557
at your corporate job,

594
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:58,861
working all those hours.

595
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,081
I regret how much time
I missed with Jacob.

596
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,561
I used to blame the job,

597
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,867
but the truth is, I
was a workaholic.

598
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:07,305
I didn't have to be on 24/7.

599
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,220
I could've set
boundaries, and that was...

600
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,396
That was on me.

601
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,315
Lucia offered me a promotion.

602
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:18,794
And I'm just worried.

603
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,841
I've already sacrificed so
much of my personal life.

604
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,799
Well, if you want the job,

605
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,887
set your boundaries.

606
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,802
And what if she
laughs in my face?

607
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:28,457
Then don't take the job.

608
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,288
Stop. I'm still mad at you.

609
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,289
Okay?

610
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:38,379
I'm sorry you have
to witness this,

611
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,426
but be grateful that we're the
only Coterie relationship right now.

612
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:42,905
Mm-hmm

613
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:45,125
Okay. Who wants pancakes?

614
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,084
- Me.
- Me.

615
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,345
- I'll take 'em.
- Coffee.

616
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,608
- I do.
- I want some.

617
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,884
I'm sorry to wake you.
Are you Mariana Adams Foster?

618
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,104
Yes.

619
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:11,892
I'm Jarell Martin,
Evan's attorney.

620
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:14,721
May I have a word?

621
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,854
Yeah, of course.

622
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:23,817
What a tragedy.

623
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:30,431
Uh, so why did you
wanna talk to me?

624
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,693
Yes. I'm here to inform you

625
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:33,566
that Evan made you his proxy.

626
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,784
His proxy?

627
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:37,351
If anything happened to him,

628
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:41,138
he appointed you in his
will to act for him in his stead.

629
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,966
Uh, what does that mean?

630
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,229
As of today,

631
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,057
you are the acting
interim CEO of Spekulate.

632
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:04,900
I'm really glad that you decided

633
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:07,076
to take the job. You
know, we need someone

634
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,340
to help us navigate
all the... the new trends.

635
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:10,602
Personally, I
always preferred it

636
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:13,300
when TikTok was just
a sound a clock made.

637
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:16,303
Well, I'm
excited to pay my dues.

638
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:17,913
Are we going on a
coffee run or something?

639
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,741
No, no. Caffeine keeps me up,

640
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,395
and it gives Murray the trots.

641
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:24,268
We are going on a pharmacy run.

642
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,226
- A pharmacy run?
- Pick up our prescriptions.

643
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:30,317
- And, um, I... I wanted a word with you.
- Oh, okay.

644
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:33,712
Uh, tell <i>Grown-ish</i>
we'll bring back the cart.

645
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,975
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

646
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,934
I am truly flattered

647
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:41,938
by your offer of the promotion
to Deputy Policy Director,

648
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:44,462
but...

649
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:50,032
I realize I've been
working so much

650
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:53,688
that I've lost touch with
my friends and my family,

651
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:56,038
and... and just very honestly,

652
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,086
my personal life has
really been suffering.

653
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,262
I'm sorry to hear that.

654
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,091
So I would love to
accept the position

655
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:07,833
if we can agree upon
reasonable hours

656
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,793
and if I could maintain
a work-life balance.

657
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:16,537
Uh, yeah, I
absolutely understand.

658
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:19,410
And we all need that balance.

659
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,977
So... So is that a... a yes?

660
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,370
Yes!

661
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,807
And I am so grateful for
the vote of confidence.

662
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:28,941
I... I think we can
accomplish a lot together.

663
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:30,030
Me too.

664
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,207
Oh, thank you.

665
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:43,739
Work-life balance.

666
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:46,220
What the hell is that?

667
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,442
What was that hug about?

668
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:57,666
Lucy is promoting me
to Deputy Policy Director.

669
00:37:58,624 --> 00:37:59,799
Seriously?

670
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,237
Uh, yeah.

671
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:06,371
You... You've been here
for, like, five minutes.

672
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,601
Are you... Are you... Are
you sure this is legal?

673
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:22,995
I have no idea.

674
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,957
Oh. Oh. These electric cars,
they're a fad, if you ask me.

675
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,786
Pick a spot, sweetheart.

676
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,527
- That's it.
- Uh, no, no.

677
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,094
There's a car right there.

678
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,748
- Aaah!
- There's a car. No! No!

679
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:39,403
Uh, Car! Car! right there.

680
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:40,491
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

681
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,363
Ah-ha!

682
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,714
All right, so listen,
what's funnier?

683
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,760
"Edna, this is the last time

684
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:52,372
I let you talk me into going
on a giant ferret safari,"

685
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,722
or, "Edna, this is the last time

686
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:58,465
I let you talk me into going
on a giant ferret safari."

687
00:38:58,466 --> 00:38:59,901
"But, Henry,

688
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:02,862
you're the one that wanted
to go to Furrasic Park."

689
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,907
That's funnier.

690
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:08,127
Yeah, we got your
joke, it wasn't bad,

691
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,433
which is why you got the job.

692
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,652
But you just needed
a little punch-up.

693
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:13,828
So congrats, kid.

694
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:16,658
You just got your first
half a joke on the show.

695
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,749
Uh, stop sign! Stop sign!

696
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,968
- Stop saying stop sign.
- Car!

697
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:26,580
I think you were
supposed to stop back there.

698
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,366
Not for a golf cart.

699
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:32,979
Hey.

700
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,112
Isabella?

701
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:41,988
Isabella?

702
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:49,298
How many diapers
does a baby soil in a day?

703
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,301
Ew, soil. Ugh!

704
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,479
What's wrong?

705
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,612
Isabella's gone with the baby.

706
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:20,891
