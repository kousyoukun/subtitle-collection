1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,821
Previously on allegiance...

2
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:05,979
This operation will collapse the American

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:07,270
economy in a single blow.

4
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:09,362
We're calling it Black Dagger.

5
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:11,721
D.C. is setting up a joint
task force to stop it.

6
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,078
The best plan we have to stop it

7
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:15,137
is to find the SVR files Mikhail stole.

8
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,394
They're on encrypted hard drives,

9
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:17,685
secure inside a laptop.

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,188
If Alex beats you to that laptop,

11
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:20,546
you'll all be dead.

12
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:22,119
Alex and the FBI team aren't driving.

13
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:23,443
They're flying.

14
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:27,592
- We got it.
- There's nothing here.

15
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:29,081
The SVR got here first.

16
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:30,406
That one. Black Dagger.

17
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,030
The entire hard drive is deleting.

18
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:33,438
Did you decrypt the file?

19
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:36,197
We're talking about a
half a mile blast radius.

20
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,027
Whoever planned this operation

21
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:39,764
was probably filmed with that camera.

22
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,663
The judge, well, he may just
decide that this task force

23
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:46,038
is nothing more than a recipe
for constitutional infringement

24
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,453
and shut you all down.

25
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:48,737
What do you got, Alex?

26
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,137
See? There he is.

27
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,815
It was you, wasn't it?

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,173
Yes.

29
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:58,998
And now, it's time to tell you everything

30
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:00,923
so you understand why.

31
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:20,237
- How long?
- It started when I was 17.

32
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,397
You knew?

33
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,796
Since before we were married.

34
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,568
I don't... how?

35
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,055
Who does this?

36
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,236
I'm on my way.

37
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,528
On your way? Did you go
get air in Connecticut?

38
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:37,852
I know. I'm sorry.

39
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:40,590
- I lost track of time.
- Michelle.

40
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,691
Hey, it's Sam.

41
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:45,402
What part of "this FISA judge
could shut our task force down"

42
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:46,724
did you not understand?

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,673
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,765
You best darken this doorway
in the next five minutes,

45
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,200
comprende?

46
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:54,501
I'll be there.

47
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:59,326
I didn't have a say in
what my future would be.

48
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,912
My father sent me to
boarding school in Switzerland

49
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:05,326
under an alias when I was nine years old.

50
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:08,319
When I was 17, I came back to Russia

51
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:12,526
and learned that my
father was a KGB general,

52
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:15,710
and I was shipped off to
the red banner institute

53
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,800
to begin my training.

54
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,985
Did you hurt anyone? Any Americans?

55
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,911
No. It was just intelligence collection.

56
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,785
Against your own country.

57
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:29,670
You were asked to recruit him.

58
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:31,671
Your father was living in Moscow.

59
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:34,340
Then he was working for
an American energy company.

60
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:37,577
The KGB wanted to steal its
deep water drilling technology,

61
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,644
but your father refused.

62
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:42,644
We fell in love instead.

63
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:46,453
All your father ever tried to
do was to get me out of a life

64
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:47,754
that I was forced into,

65
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,622
a life that I never wanted.

66
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,768
I agreed to keep my eyes open,

67
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,336
that's all,

68
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:05,105
to try to spot people
vulnerable to recruitment.

69
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:06,773
How long did it take them to
get you to do more than that?

70
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:08,842
They threatened to hurt my family, Alex.

71
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:10,343
Then, you should've gone to the FBI.

72
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,946
- You should've gotten out.
- I did get out.

73
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:16,549
For seven years, and then they came back.

74
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,043
Why?

75
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,921
You.

76
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:22,956
They came for you.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,567
Remember your steps, Alex.

78
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,671
Oh, remember your steps, Alex.

79
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:47,214
Our whole life, it's a lie.

80
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:48,834
No.

81
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:50,834
Not the love.

82
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,933
Not the family.

83
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,355
I know this is a lot.

84
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:56,556
I can't imagine what you're thinking.

85
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:58,291
I think you're traitors.

86
00:03:58,293 --> 00:04:01,643
This is about something much
bigger than us right now, Alex.

87
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:03,563
The SVR has a plan.

88
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:05,376
Codename Black Dagger.

89
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:06,943
How do you know that name?

90
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:08,468
It was on Mikhail's laptop.

91
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,969
Which you stole from City Hall.

92
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,672
Yes, and then we brought
it to the FBI field office

93
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:14,050
- to turn it in.
- That's a lie.

94
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,109
I would've heard about that.

95
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,821
When we arrived at the federal building,

96
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:18,679
we checked the laptop to make
sure it had something real.

97
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:20,661
We triggered an auto-delete program.

98
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:24,009
We were only able to catch a
few fragments before it was gone.

99
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,409
Read this.

100
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,751
Five psi blast radius of
half a mile in New York City.

101
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,072
That's... tens of thousands
of people would die.

102
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,390
This has to be a fake.

103
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:54,822
This would start another war.

104
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:57,543
Only if someone could
prove that Russia did it.

105
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,089
Nothing stays secret for very long anymore.

106
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:01,880
They know that. They
would never take this risk.

107
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,805
Alex, you figured out that
Mikhail stole the files

108
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,857
that he did.

109
00:05:04,882 --> 00:05:07,498
These are the files that
were on Mikhail's computer.

110
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:09,456
Well, I only have your word for that.

111
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:11,048
Yes.

112
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:13,173
Even though you've been
lying to me every day

113
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:14,796
of my entire life.

114
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:22,597
Let the judge know we're ready.

115
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,597
Are you okay?

116
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:30,716
I'm okay.

117
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,259
Good, because Judge Dale is a pit bull.

118
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,624
He'll rip your throat
out if he doesn't like

119
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,182
what you have to say.

120
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,442
All right, let's begin.

121
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:44,512
Black Dagger is real, and
we need to try to stop it.

122
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,604
If it's real, then we need
to take this to the FBI.

123
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,915
If we do that, the SVR knows
that their plan has been burned,

124
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,142
and they change the when
and the where and the how.

125
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,441
What are you talking about?

126
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:55,141
They have a mole inside
the U.S. government.

127
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,000
How else could they catch
Mikhail before he could defect?

128
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,357
And how could they know what case the CIA

129
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:03,540
put you on before you even
arrived in New York last week?

130
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:06,299
You have an answer for
everything, don't you?

131
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,500
Just like you did my entire childhood.

132
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,860
Where are you going?

133
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,095
I'm late for a hearing with a FISA judge.

134
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:18,408
My colleagues are expecting
me to swear to new evidence

135
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,744
we found that someone broke
into Philadelphia City Hall

136
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,635
and stole Mikhail's laptop before us.

137
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,971
Then we're asking for a
warrant for the Masonic Temple's

138
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:27,810
security footage which you will be on.

139
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:31,621
Are you actually asking me to
let you march a forensic team

140
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:35,281
back to Philadelphia City
Hall, again in secret,

141
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:37,917
as well as to mandate a Masonic Temple,

142
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,154
arguably protected by first
amendment religious freedoms,

143
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:43,790
to turn over all its
internal camera footage?

144
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,959
Mr. O'Connor and I just
returned from Philadelphia where

145
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:50,830
we discovered an old tunnel
running from the Masonic Temple

146
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:52,365
to the basement of City Hall.

147
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,434
This would explain how Russian operatives

148
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:57,170
could've gotten past
several layers of security

149
00:06:57,172 --> 00:07:00,822
and into the room where we
believe the laptop was hidden.

150
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:03,248
Further, we acquired video that showed one,

151
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:08,187
possibly two, figures entering
the back entrance of the temple.

152
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:10,927
Finally, we found residue
of what we believe is

153
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:14,796
a chemical agent thieves use
to freeze and break the lock.

154
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:16,598
Think about what you're doing.

155
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,658
Think about what you've done.

156
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,861
If you turn us in, your mother
and I go to prison, Natalie too.

157
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:23,329
I think you belong there.

158
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:27,396
And Sarah, where does she belong?

159
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,449
You will destroy our
entire family and for what?

160
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:34,451
We don't have enough information
yet for the FBI or the CIA

161
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:36,008
to stop Black Dagger,

162
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,695
but we might be able to
stop it if you help us.

163
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,515
On our own?

164
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:44,384
Do you realize how crazy that is?

165
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,529
Is it? We beat you to City Hall.

166
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:47,853
You know how governments work.

167
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:51,072
You can't defeat the
SVR playing by the rules.

168
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,771
Mr. O'Connor.

169
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:56,471
Mr. O'Connor?

170
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,288
This whole thing was your idea, correct?

171
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,827
Based on your theories,

172
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:05,287
and you've been staring into
space for the last five minutes?

173
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,873
Sorry, sir.

174
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,376
I take it you will attest to the same facts

175
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:11,677
as Special Agent Prado?

176
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:15,276
Sir, I need a minute to consider my answer.

177
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,654
The CIA and FBI have resources you don't.

178
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:23,647
Resources we'll have if you help us.

179
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,259
You work the leads your
task force can handle.

180
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,510
We'll do everything else
they're not allowed to.

181
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,006
We work together as a family.

182
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,831
The moment we have enough
information to prove

183
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,168
that Black Dagger's real,
we go straight to the FBI.

184
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,907
I'm sorry, Alex...

185
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,675
About everything.

186
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:49,015
Don't.

187
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:53,186
Alex, no matter what happens,

188
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,101
we love you.

189
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,423
I don't want you to consider your answer.

190
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:01,781
I want it unvarnished. And
remember, you're under oath.

191
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,130
That is what I'm considering.

192
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:06,332
- The boy's gone off the rails.
- He'll be fine.

193
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:09,769
Mr. O'Connor, when you're
under oath, you tell the truth.

194
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:11,043
It's simple.

195
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:15,508
Do you believe this to be an SVR operative?

196
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:21,681
I believe there's every possibility

197
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:24,117
that the man in that footage
is not breaking into the temple.

198
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:27,387
Wind speeds during the day were
between 8 and 12 miles per hour.

199
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:29,989
He was most likely shielding
himself from the wind

200
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,324
trying to light a cigarette.

201
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:32,959
What about the residue on the gate?

202
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,494
Denatonium benzoate.

203
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:37,163
It's a chemical compound
found in canned air

204
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:39,632
which could be used to freeze metal,

205
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,901
but it's also a bittering
agent found in rat poisoning

206
00:09:41,903 --> 00:09:43,503
to make it unappealing to pets.

207
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:45,071
I'm confused.

208
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:49,253
Are you telling me an SVR
agent stole the files or not?

209
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,610
Under oath, Sir...

210
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:54,847
No.

211
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:56,716
Having looked at all the possibilities,

212
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:59,752
there's no way I can possibly
stand by my original theory.

213
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:09,068
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

214
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,473
What the hell was that?

215
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:16,405
- Submarine your own theory?
- Sir, I'm sorry.

216
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,630
I could've sworn you still had
your spine when we left Philly.

217
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,632
Just talk me through your thought process.

218
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:22,701
One minute, you're shouting
about SVR operatives

219
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,369
breaking in through the Masonic Temple.

220
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,204
An hour later, it was most
likely the cleaning crew?

221
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,106
Everything just started
to unravel in my head.

222
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,275
I couldn't say for certain
that my theories were correct.

223
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,010
You could've mentioned
that before I stood up

224
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,945
and spouted a story you sold me on.

225
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,281
You saw the judge's
face. He wasn't buying it.

226
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:38,016
Tactically, it was better
for me to take a hit

227
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,652
than for him to blame the entire
task force and shut us down.

228
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:41,869
Don't expect a thank you.

229
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:43,510
We all knew there was
a chance we could lose,

230
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:45,870
but it was worth the risk.

231
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:07,012
Alex O'Connor went in
front of a FISA judge today.

232
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,410
Do you know why?

233
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,518
No.

234
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:13,446
I told you the bug in his shirt

235
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,207
died last week when we
were in Philadelphia.

236
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,590
He met with his parents before the hearing.

237
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:18,560
What did they discuss?

238
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:20,952
Surely Katya debriefed you.

239
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,143
No.

240
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,722
She's a difficult one to keep in harness.

241
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:28,441
If half the men in the SVR had her will,

242
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:29,637
we'd own the world.

243
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:32,437
Listen, don't worry. I...

244
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,637
I do worry, Dobrynin, about your excuses.

245
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,722
The O'Connor family are your assets,

246
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,038
your responsibility.

247
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:44,029
You will know every
conversation that they have,

248
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:46,388
every move they make.

249
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,014
If you cannot accomplish
this, I have men who will.

250
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,937
You understand?

251
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,338
It is nice how you have made
a life for yourself here.

252
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,386
Enjoy, because if your
reassignment becomes necessary,

253
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:06,612
it will not involve a
flight home to Russia.

254
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,277
They're bank accounts,

255
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,279
information we took from Mikhail's egg.

256
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,456
Whoever controls them

257
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,225
might lead us to who
will carry out the attack.

258
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,784
The SVR will hire an outside operator.

259
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,252
They want levels of deniability

260
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:23,254
between them and the
execution of the operation

261
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:25,423
and a person they know can deliver.

262
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,425
It'll cost big money.

263
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,160
So what do you want from me?

264
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,629
Treasury maintains a database

265
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:32,464
to track suspicious money transfers.

266
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,699
Fincen. It's for law
enforcement agencies only.

267
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,120
CIA doesn't have access.

268
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:40,020
Yes, but your task force
is full of FBI agents.

269
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,275
I won't steal an FBI agent's access code.

270
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,511
Stopping the SVR means your hands

271
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,046
will have to get dirty, Alex.

272
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:50,448
Stealing the code is what
the operation requires.

273
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,620
And lying to me about your affair.

274
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,287
Is that what the operation required?

275
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,855
Yes.

276
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:07,065
This is gonna get a lot
worse before it gets better.

277
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:10,001
But I promise you as
soon we get what we need,

278
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:11,803
we go to the authorities.

279
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:17,375
For now, this is the play.

280
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:18,834
What's this?

281
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,525
Tradecraft.

282
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,733
The phone is untraceable, clean.

283
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:24,649
We switch them out once a week.

284
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:25,733
Just to be safe.

285
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:29,695
Alex, draw us a floor
plan of the task force.

286
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,668
You don't want to be in either bullpen.

287
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,037
There's too many people looking
and no way to track them.

288
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,739
And this is where your boss sits?

289
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:49,441
- Yes.
- Well, you couldn't go in there

290
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:50,975
without being noticed by a lot of people.

291
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,044
This is you?

292
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:54,573
Then this is your obvious target.

293
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,853
No.

294
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,428
But you have reason to be in there.

295
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,752
No, not now.

296
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:01,786
Why?

297
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:03,948
No. Just pick another desk.

298
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,452
Whose desk is it?

299
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,631
It's Michelle's, my partner.

300
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:14,309
- You like her?
- Of course I like her.

301
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:15,694
She's my partner.

302
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:19,647
Are you... Romantically interested in her?

303
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:22,006
- No.
- Honey, it's okay if you are.

304
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,408
She is my partner.

305
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,842
I am not gonna steal from her,

306
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,911
especially after what
happened in court today.

307
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,579
Then you need a peace offering.

308
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,916
- How does she take her coffee?
- What?

309
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,285
Tomorrow, you bring her a
cup. You spill it on her.

310
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:38,029
When she leaves to clean up,
you're alone with her computer.

311
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,588
This is what you're really like.

312
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:43,182
Everything calculated,
thought out, designed.

313
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,575
Every lie I've ever told you has cost me.

314
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,599
How do you do it? How do you
look at someone in the eye,

315
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,829
someone that you care
about, and deceive them?

316
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,083
You remind yourself that
it's for the greater good,

317
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,628
and you hope that someday
they'll forgive you.

318
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,829
Give him time, Katya.

319
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:13,128
He'll come around.

320
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,128
When Michelle leaves her
desk, you insert the skimmer

321
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,131
into her card reader like this.

322
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,529
Listen for the click.

323
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,688
When she inserts her ID
and types in her password,

324
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:26,414
the skimmer will record both
electronic transmissions.

325
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,329
You'll have a perfect clone of her login.

326
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,543
I guess you do more in Silicon Alley

327
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:35,572
than develop dating
websites and music apps.

328
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,105
You're really not gonna say anything?

329
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:45,057
About what?

330
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,884
About this.

331
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:52,084
Everything you found
out about us, about me?

332
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,055
What do you want me to say?

333
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,784
Call me a liar, yell, hit the wall.

334
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:01,084
- How would that help?
- It would help me, okay?

335
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,872
It would help me if you were mad at me.

336
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,387
- That makes no sense.
- It makes sense to me.

337
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,483
I mean, this is worse. You're ignoring me.

338
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:12,183
You know, I get it now.

339
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:16,053
Why everything was always
so tense between you and mom.

340
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:20,499
She ruined your life.

341
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,083
Now she's doing it to you.

342
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,395
She and dad.

343
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:33,428
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

344
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:41,746
Sorry it happened to you.

345
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,915
You can always talk to me.

346
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,604
Good night.

347
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,113
I have to get up early in the morning

348
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:51,538
and go commit a felony.

349
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:41,273
Peace offering.

350
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,474
You usually have a coffee around 10:00,

351
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,142
splash of milk, no sugar.

352
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:47,916
Should I think it's
weird that you know that?

353
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,608
No.

354
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,215
Yesterday, before the hearing,

355
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:54,318
you could've said, "Michelle,
I'm having second thoughts."

356
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,953
Instead, you made me look like an idiot.

357
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,389
- It wasn't my intention.
- You blindsided me.

358
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,072
You didn't trust me with your doubts.

359
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:01,564
If you can't trust me,

360
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,288
Brock should assign you another partner.

361
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:05,772
I don't want another partner.

362
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:08,011
I do trust you.

363
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,290
Okay.

364
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:13,483
O'Connor, follow me.

365
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:15,672
Leave the coffee.

366
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:19,871
What's going on?

367
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:21,823
A distinguished member
of the bureau's internal

368
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:23,547
counterintelligence staff has decided

369
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,349
to pay us an unannounced visit.

370
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:27,672
- For what?
- Polygraph us.

371
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:29,772
What, right now?

372
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,139
Make it fast.

373
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:33,497
Every minute he's with you is a minute

374
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:34,955
he's not doing his job for me.

375
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,979
Brock, someday, I swear,

376
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:39,071
I'm gonna catch you in a good mood.

377
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:42,171
Special Agent Faber.

378
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,038
- Jason Faber?
- Yeah, that's right.

379
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:46,530
- How do you know my name?
- You were one of the agents

380
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:48,155
that led the Robert Hanson investigation.

381
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:53,110
Ah, well, always nice to
meet a student of the game.

382
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,866
Not that this is a game.

383
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,175
Uh, what?

384
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:57,567
Mole hunting.

385
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,909
Is there a mole?

386
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:03,402
There's always a mole, Alex, always a mole.

387
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,460
Somewhere, somebody's trying
to betray this country,

388
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,385
and I have the distinct honor
and privilege of finding 'em

389
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,544
and ensuring they spend 23
hours a day in a tiny little cell

390
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,103
for the rest of their lives.

391
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:14,632
So you ready?

392
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:16,401
Uh, I haven't taken a poly

393
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:17,725
since finishing analyst training.

394
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,004
There's nothing to worry about.

395
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:23,407
Unless you got something
to worry about, right?

396
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,005
You remember the last time you were here?

397
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,806
I'm not sure.

398
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:39,931
It was the week I moved in.

399
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:43,356
You kept telling me my furniture
was in all the wrong places.

400
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:48,205
Well, I was probably wrong
because it looks really nice.

401
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:51,373
I know why you're here.

402
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,976
You're worried about Alex.

403
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:56,557
His whole world changed overnight.

404
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:58,763
And whose fault is that?

405
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:04,164
He seemed okay when he left last night...

406
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,623
Considering everything.

407
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:09,092
Just the thought of him in that office

408
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:13,464
acting on his own, yes, I am worried.

409
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,507
Chew your lip to bits
like that when it's me

410
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,664
out in the field?

411
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:21,382
Do you remember when you were little

412
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:23,574
and we used to walk to Prospect Park,

413
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,576
and you and Alex decided
that your favorite horses

414
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,601
on that carousel were brother and sister?

415
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,526
Buster and Babs.

416
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,783
Well, we would... we would leave the house,

417
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,855
we'd be holding hands, and we'd walk.

418
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,411
Two seconds later, you had to take off.

419
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,355
You had to run. You had to go fast.

420
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:42,515
You would get so far
ahead that I had to choose.

421
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:46,056
Do I stay with Alex or
do I chase after you?

422
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,155
I remember.

423
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:50,256
You always chose Alex.

424
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:53,855
It's not because I love you any less.

425
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:55,438
But I had faith in you.

426
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,096
I knew that if you got lost,

427
00:20:57,098 --> 00:20:59,556
I knew that you would find your way home.

428
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:18,956
I'm surprised you use a Gauge Pro X.

429
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:21,487
Accuracy rate's barely over 60%.

430
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,322
That's okay. Truthfully,
I don't need the machine

431
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,756
to know when people are
lying 'cause I can read minds.

432
00:21:27,423 --> 00:21:30,257
But it's good to have
some charts to take to D.C.

433
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:31,855
How does it feel, Alex?

434
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:33,410
What?

435
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:35,445
I don't know. The long fall from grace.

436
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,256
Golden boy whiffed big.

437
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:39,181
Does it sting?

438
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:40,941
Is that your first question?

439
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,462
No, just curious.

440
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:45,695
- Do you work for the CIA?
- Yes.

441
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,990
Is Russian your first language?

442
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,581
My mother spoke it in
the house, growing up.

443
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:49,710
So that's a yes?

444
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:51,606
I learned English and
Russian at the same time.

445
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:54,531
Call it a yes with hesitation.

446
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,725
Did you attend Princeton University?

447
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,492
- Yes.
- And you received a bachelor's

448
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:02,156
and master's degree after 3 1/2 years.

449
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:05,084
Yes. Uh, well, 3 years.

450
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:06,810
Oh, I misread that.

451
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:08,757
You're smarter than I thought.

452
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:10,603
Do you like ice cream sandwiches?

453
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,103
I'm sorry?

454
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:16,084
I-I'm not sure.

455
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,986
I don't have an opinion. Neutral.

456
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,644
It's a yes or no question, Alex.

457
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,373
Well, no, it's not. It depends on...

458
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:23,272
You're making this more
complicated than it is, son.

459
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,434
I know how it is.

460
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:28,186
The sight of a polygraph can
make you forget your own name.

461
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:30,586
Almost done, relax.

462
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:33,285
Ice cream sandwich, yea or nay?

463
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,062
- Yea.
- Have you ever had

464
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,541
an unreported contact with a
foreign intelligence operative?

465
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,406
What?

466
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:41,764
Maybe a friend of your
mom's showed up one day

467
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,455
- asking for a favor?
- That's not a question.

468
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,290
Have you ever spied on your country, Alex?

469
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:48,891
No, never.

470
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:53,507
Do you work for the FBI?

471
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:57,290
That, and I do a little
exotic dancing on the side.

472
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:59,430
Do you work for the FBI?

473
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:02,690
No. Thank God. No offense.

474
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,381
Do you work for the FBI?

475
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:08,175
That's what my badge says.

476
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,967
I can see you haven't changed
much since you worked for me.

477
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:12,533
Doesn't the Bureau have some rule

478
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,939
against giving a poly to someone you know?

479
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:16,477
No. It's actually harder to lie to someone

480
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:17,801
you know than to a stranger,

481
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:19,939
so that would be a pretty silly rule.

482
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:21,530
Just get to what you
want to know, all right?

483
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:23,455
Some of us actually have to work today.

484
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,039
You take care of your father.

485
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:27,138
Liver cancer, is that correct?

486
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:29,539
He has nine months, maybe less.

487
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:31,251
It's more information than I asked for,

488
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,240
but I'm sorry to hear that.

489
00:23:33,265 --> 00:23:36,240
Must be expensive and lonely too.

490
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:37,704
You gonna give me a hug now?

491
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:40,030
Caregivers make perfect
recruitment targets.

492
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:42,060
You think I'd sell my
country out for a couple

493
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:44,153
of bucks and a Russian honey?

494
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:46,208
You tell me.

495
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,206
Kiss my ass, Faber.

496
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:51,419
Have you had contact with
any suspicious individuals

497
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:53,607
- in the past year?
- Besides you?

498
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,500
And no, I have never told anyone
you lied about your handicap

499
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:57,957
when we played Pinehurst.

500
00:23:57,982 --> 00:24:00,115
Your bosses have any
idea how insolent you are?

501
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,916
Insolent?

502
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,309
Is your son studying for
the sats or something?

503
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:05,933
No way you know that word on your own.

504
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:09,182
Are you currently taking any medications?

505
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:13,378
Claritin, midol, Advil.

506
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:16,060
A lot of Advil for the hangovers.

507
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:17,315
Funny.

508
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,507
- How about narcotics?
- No.

509
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:20,916
No.

510
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:24,269
You did use cocaine
four years ago in Miami.

511
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:26,715
To protect my cover so I
didn't end up with a bullet

512
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,573
- to the back of my head, yes.
- How many times?

513
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:30,025
That operation is compartmented,

514
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,026
and I'm not supposed to
talk about it to anyone,

515
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:34,125
not even my old supervisory agent

516
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,716
who hasn't been completely read into it.

517
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,325
No. Lucky for us, I have been.

518
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,027
So let's talk about how
many times you used cocaine.

519
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:48,660
I didn't lie about my handicap.

520
00:24:48,662 --> 00:24:50,229
I was just having an off day.

521
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:51,563
Let me hook you up to one of your machines.

522
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:52,869
We'll find out for sure.

523
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:54,460
What's the story with Mr. Twitchy?

524
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:55,968
Who?

525
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,861
Oh, Alex?

526
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:01,484
He's different. The best
analysts usually are.

527
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:04,076
- Why?
- Bombed his poly.

528
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:05,844
I mean, he practically broke the machine,

529
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:07,601
his readings were so erratic.

530
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:09,348
You saying he was lying to you?

531
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,983
No, I'm just saying the machine

532
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:13,018
- doesn't work on him.
- Oh, I'm not surprised.

533
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,820
I asked him if he liked
ice cream sandwiches.

534
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,755
You'd have thought I asked
Oswald if he killed Kennedy.

535
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:18,490
Well, if you redo the test,

536
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,626
and just tell him the brand
and flavor of ice cream sandwich

537
00:25:20,628 --> 00:25:23,796
and every single ingredient
in it, ambient air temperature,

538
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:25,852
the time of day, and what he had for lunch,

539
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,300
I bet you a hundred bucks
you get a normal reading then.

540
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:29,716
Well, that's great,

541
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,294
but I don't have that
much time on my hands.

542
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:34,706
Jason, no BS.

543
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:36,993
Why's one of the Bureau's
most experienced spy catchers

544
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,685
coming up here doing
field polygraphs in person?

545
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:42,287
You're smart enough to know
the answer to that question.

546
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:44,792
I don't feel a need to answer it.

547
00:25:58,361 --> 00:25:59,528
Richie, come on.

548
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,696
What?

549
00:26:00,698 --> 00:26:02,030
My paper's due in two days.

550
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:04,133
So finish it at my dad's place.

551
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,835
Come on. He's not getting home until 7:00.

552
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:09,241
Great. I can work while you smoke a bowl

553
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,749
and play some videogames.

554
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:12,448
Yeah.

555
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:18,148
You can be a real tool sometimes.

556
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:20,375
Come on.

557
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:28,132
Hello, Richie.

558
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:30,532
Who the hell are you?

559
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,726
You and I need to have a talk.

560
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:35,485
Dude, you need to take your hand off me.

561
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,125
What is this?

562
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,931
I need you to help me
with something with Sarah.

563
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,070
Here's the field report you wanted.

564
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,435
I'm starting to think
you want me to hate you.

565
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,959
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

566
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,704
I'm sorry.

567
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:04,503
I'm sorry.

568
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:27,766
Alex.

569
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,091
Hi.

570
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:35,171
So the surveillance footage
from the Masonic Temple.

571
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,558
What about it?

572
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,798
You convinced me that it would show us

573
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,155
who broke into Philly City Hall.

574
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,379
Judge Dale denied our warrant.

575
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:43,104
We don't need the judge.

576
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,930
An ex-CIA buddy of mine
is a Mason up in Philly.

577
00:27:46,013 --> 00:27:47,279
He still has the clearances for me

578
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:49,004
to tell him the situation.

579
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:51,617
He got us the tapes no problem.

580
00:27:51,642 --> 00:27:52,917
Wait, what?

581
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,982
Just because you lost
confidence in yourself,

582
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,340
kid, doesn't mean I did.

583
00:27:56,365 --> 00:27:58,098
A bureau agent made it to the temple

584
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,724
just before their system
did its 72 hour recycle

585
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,083
and erased all the footage.

586
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:04,616
For once, the fates are on our side.

587
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:06,721
Has he seen the footage?

588
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:08,690
No. He sealed the hard drive,

589
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:10,916
and it's headed straight back here.

590
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:13,144
That's great.

591
00:28:13,397 --> 00:28:16,016
I can't wait to see who
did this in handcuffs.

592
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:17,753
Me too.

593
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:28,777
- Hello?
- It's me.

594
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,345
Alex, how's it going?

595
00:28:30,347 --> 00:28:32,180
A federal agent is
transporting a hard drive

596
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:34,192
with security footage
from the Masonic Temple

597
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,682
to the task force offices.

598
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:38,708
- You're both gonna be exposed.
- You're sure?

599
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:39,581
Yes.

600
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:42,581
I can't stop them from
watching it once it gets here.

601
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:44,955
Okay. Go back to work.

602
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,856
We'll take care of everything.

603
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,905
It's open. Hey.

604
00:28:57,907 --> 00:28:59,755
I bought every magnet in the store.

605
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,555
Do you think that's gonna be enough?

606
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,621
It's hard to say. I mean,
there's no way to know

607
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:06,814
how close the magnets have to
be near the drive to erase it.

608
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:09,956
Here.

609
00:29:10,844 --> 00:29:13,645
The closer we get, the
better chance we have.

610
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:19,255
Oh.

611
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:23,755
I'm sorry again about
before with the drink.

612
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,255
It's okay.

613
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,555
Hey. Do you remember the name Oleg Zhulov?

614
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:31,255
SVR officer first told Irina Semovetskaya

615
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,656
about SVR's plot to attack America.

616
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,781
He just ditched our surveillance on him.

617
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,693
So he's gone operational?

618
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:41,456
That or he's blowing town
before SVR fireworks start.

619
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,887
Either way, I want him put back in a box.

620
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,112
Have TSA put him on a no fly list.

621
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:48,082
Alert Customs, Immigration,
and the Coast Guard.

622
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:48,986
On it.

623
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:50,678
I'll do a link analysis
of known associates.

624
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:52,601
I just hope the time we
spent getting rectal exams

625
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,631
from Dr. Faber didn't cost
us our chance to get him.

626
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,551
He's here. Grey overcoat
carrying a manila envelope.

627
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:40,808
Oh, no.

628
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,011
It's 915 not 519.

629
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:05,166
Zhulov, Z-H-U-L-O-V.

630
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:07,110
First name, Oleg.

631
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:09,910
I need any surveillance.

632
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:12,611
Uh-huh.

633
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:16,511
Alex.

634
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:19,215
I'll need to call you back.

635
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:27,241
You ready to find out who
beat you to the egg in Philly?

636
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:33,910
There we go.

637
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:41,101
Oh, oh, no.

638
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:42,901
Oh, no.

639
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:45,002
No, come on.

640
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,302
No, come on.

641
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:52,604
You got to be kidding me.

642
00:31:58,601 --> 00:31:59,867
Yup. I understand.

643
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:01,646
Thank you.

644
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,369
Well, that's not a happy face.

645
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:07,942
The Masonic Temple reset
their video service an hour

646
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,942
after our copy was made.

647
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,043
They can't recover it?

648
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:15,302
No. That was our only shot.

649
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:26,741
You're a regular Zen master, huh?

650
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,925
What?

651
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,379
If that video footage panned out,

652
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:33,567
you're back to being the golden boy.

653
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:38,098
Instead, it's a bust, and
you don't even drop your head.

654
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:39,641
It was bad luck. No time to dwell.

655
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,219
Something else'll turn up.

656
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:44,386
Healthy perspective.

657
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:51,222
See you around, Alex.

658
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,861
You did it. The drive was wiped.

659
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:11,861
We're not in handcuffs, so I figured.

660
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,361
How can you be so at ease doing this stuff?

661
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,960
How are you holding up?

662
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,784
You could tell mom she
doesn't have to send you

663
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:24,161
to check up on me.

664
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:26,561
I'm not here because of mom.

665
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:29,150
I'm here to check up on you.

666
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:32,210
Your big sister who loves you.

667
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:40,361
Tell me it gets easier.

668
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:43,960
Doing it, yes.

669
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,837
Living with it, no.

670
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:56,156
Sarah will be home from
the library in 15 minutes.

671
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:57,859
What have you got?

672
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,717
According to fincen, the account numbers

673
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:02,390
we can identify are registered
to a wall street firm,

674
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:04,021
Hensley financial services.

675
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:06,638
The specific accounts are under
the control of Scott Tolliver,

676
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:07,895
a senior broker.

677
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:10,308
So who is the money going to?

678
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,701
That's the problem.

679
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:13,742
The destination account
isn't possible to ID.

680
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,247
The money is electronically
chopped into thousands

681
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:18,516
of transactions in a
process known as "packeting."

682
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:20,948
It's a technique used by
money launderers to clean cash

683
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:22,604
and mask its final destination.

684
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:24,863
Then we need to speak with this Tolliver.

685
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:27,088
If he's moving the money,
he's our link to Black Dagger.

686
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:29,046
And why would he talk to you?

687
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:31,051
If he's laundering money,
he's breaking federal law.

688
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:32,353
That gives us leverage.

689
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:33,921
We are also breaking federal law.

690
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:36,973
You have been for 20
years, and now I am too.

691
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,244
Tolliver's a criminal trying to get rich.

692
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,803
You're trying to stop the
SVR from crippling America.

693
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:44,362
There's a huge difference, Alex.

694
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:48,382
All right. So how do we get to him?

695
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:55,281
Stoli rocks and a Cohiba.

696
00:34:58,235 --> 00:34:59,701
You smoke cigars?

697
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:02,226
No. I buy them to stir my cocktail.

698
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,927
No, the Esplendido.

699
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,740
I don't know a lot of
women who are connoisseurs.

700
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:15,457
Then you don't know
the right kind of women.

701
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:20,068
- Put that on my tab.
- Sure you want to do that?

702
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:22,770
It's gonna add $500 to your Amex,

703
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:24,795
and I'm not even gonna say thanks.

704
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:29,220
Well, it's a thousand,
and I'll take my chances.

705
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:33,335
Each of these is made from
individually dried leaves

706
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,121
and hand rolled by the
number eight roller in Cuba.

707
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,929
Did you know that only the
female number eight roller

708
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:42,121
is allowed to make the Esplendido?

709
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:46,627
You know, you're not supposed
to smoke that in here.

710
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:49,163
I do a lot of things
I'm not supposed to do.

711
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:54,989
Are you clear?

712
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:57,081
We lost the SVR tail an hour ago.

713
00:35:57,106 --> 00:35:59,626
- You sure?
- Yeah.

714
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:09,561
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

715
00:36:09,974 --> 00:36:11,874
I brought these DVDs.

716
00:36:11,899 --> 00:36:14,299
I thought they might help
you finish that paper.

717
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:15,590
Come in.

718
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,608
We're studying.

719
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:21,291
Nothing else.

720
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:23,591
Okay.

721
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:53,612
Tom Hardy was way cooler as Bane.

722
00:36:53,637 --> 00:36:56,532
Too bad I can't write my paper
on the "Dark Knight Rises".

723
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:58,946
_

724
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,942
The night Vasso was murdered,

725
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:26,911
another man, SVR, was shot.

726
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:29,647
It never made sense they'd
take out their own shooter.

727
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:35,703
Was that you?

728
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:38,849
He was going to kill you.

729
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:41,702
I had no choice. You are my son.

730
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:46,622
How many people have you killed?

731
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:48,414
None.

732
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:50,973
That was the first time.

733
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,101
I want to believe that.

734
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,202
You should.

735
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,558
There they are.

736
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,880
Oh-ho, timber.

737
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:27,196
Shut up.

738
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,338
I'm 1% sober.

739
00:38:29,363 --> 00:38:31,897
Okay then. Follow me.

740
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:44,338
Wow.

741
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,638
You must have some killer parties here.

742
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:49,682
You're about to find out.

743
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,873
I like the sound of that.

744
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:55,138
Alex, she's gonna be okay.

745
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:57,329
You want something to drink?

746
00:38:57,354 --> 00:39:00,838
How about some music?

747
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:02,707
To set the mood?

748
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:05,638
No. I want to dance.

749
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:18,089
You're a bad girl, aren't you?

750
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:20,591
You have no idea.

751
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,706
No peeking yet.

752
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:57,328
You like to play games.

753
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,205
Come on, Natalie. Get it over with.

754
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,006
Ah! Bitch.

755
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,095
Katya, Katya, wait, wait, wait, wait.

756
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,203
Alex, stay right here.

757
00:41:17,385 --> 00:41:19,076
Dad, dad.

758
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:21,340
Dad, knock it off.

759
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,887
