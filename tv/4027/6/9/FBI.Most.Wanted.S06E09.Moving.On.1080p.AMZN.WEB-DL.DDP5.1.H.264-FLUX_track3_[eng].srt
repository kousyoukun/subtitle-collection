1
00:00:02,393 --> 00:00:04,090
Boy, oh, boy,
am I ready for lunch.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,396
You're on your way, right?

3
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:10,009
Well, I've got an appetite.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,577
The corner house left their
beagle out in the yard again.

5
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:16,363
I swear, I was
running for my life.

6
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:19,975
What in the heck?

7
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:22,238
Hold on, Dad.

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,761
Something's spilled in my seat.

9
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,937
It's all wet.

10
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:27,592
It smells like gasoline.

11
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,035
Call 911!

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,862
Somebody help!

13
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,690
Call 911!

14
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:02,496
Hi, sis.

15
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,063
If you're calling to try
to convince me

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,368
to talk to Dad again,

17
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,196
it's a lost cause,
so let it go.

18
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:10,025
It's not why I'm calling.

19
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,679
I need some advice.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,463
Is everything OK?
Are the kids all right?

21
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,030
No, no, no.
The kids are great.

22
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,379
I just, uh--

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,902
I just dropped
them off at school.

24
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:22,168
Um...

25
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,909
it's Brett.

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,261
Oh, OK.

27
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,393
Um, how are his
interviews going?

28
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:31,916
There was no interview.

29
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,396
I just found out
he's been lying to me

30
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:37,096
for the last six months
about looking for a job.

31
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,749
I'm sorry. What?

32
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,447
All those
supposed interviews,

33
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,537
and he's just been
hanging out at bars.

34
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,800
OK, well, who the hell
is paying his bar tab?

35
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,584
I'm keeping us afloat.

36
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:50,413
I'm working overtime at Dad's
shop, doing the accounting.

37
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:53,764
But between work and the kids,
I can't do this anymore.

38
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:56,115
And to find out he's been
lying on top of all this, I--

39
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,943
You're not supposed to be
doing this alone, Tink.

40
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:02,121
You have a partner who was
supposed to be getting a job.

41
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,297
I don't blame him.
I never did.

42
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,168
He's had it rough.

43
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,475
Tink, I'm sorry, OK?

44
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:11,956
I'm--I'm so sorry
that this is happening.

45
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,089
And I know that
he hasn't had it easy.

46
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,615
But he still has to take
accountability for this, OK?

47
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:21,444
You need to talk
to your husband, all right?

48
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,186
You need to tell him
that you know and--

49
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,622
I'm really sorry.

50
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:28,190
Work is calling,
so I need to go.

51
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,150
But I want you to sit down
and have a come-to-Jesus talk

52
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,848
with your husband.

53
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:37,853
Promise?

54
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,768
OK.

55
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,162
OK, I will.

56
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,815
Thank you for listening, Nina.

57
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,077
I love you.

58
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:47,732
Mean it.

59
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,518
I love you more.

60
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,260
Victim's a postal worker
named Vicky Collins.

61
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,565
She was halfway
through her daily route

62
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,827
when her truck caught fire.

63
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:58,307
And she suffered
third-degree burns.

64
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:01,049
She was DOA when I got here.

65
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,660
- Who's our witness?
- A guy named Conrad Wong.

66
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,793
He was over there with his baby
when he saw a Black male,

67
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,229
medium build,
put a package wrapped

68
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,709
in duct tape in the truck.

69
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,406
Figured it was just
a neighbor dropping off

70
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,755
some last-minute mail till
he heard Vicky screaming

71
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,148
and saw the fire.

72
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,324
When he ran to help,
he saw that same Black male

73
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,543
taking off headed that way.

74
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,109
And what's this from?

75
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,200
Part of the blanket Mr. Wong
used to try to save Vicky.

76
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,505
Burned both his hands
pretty bad.

77
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:24,203
He's at the hospital
getting treated now.

78
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,726
Any other witnesses?

79
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,381
Not so far.

80
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,994
Going to be hard to find
any usable evidence.

81
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,691
That truck had half a day's
worth of mail in it.

82
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,345
Mr. Wong said it burned up
really fast.

83
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,651
That's why we have the ATF

84
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,435
sending out their
arson specialists.

85
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:40,871
Can you check on his status?

86
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,265
Yeah.

87
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:51,055
Remy, this is the victim's
father, Caleb Collins.

88
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:53,275
He's a retired firefighter
from Philadelphia.

89
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,276
Special Agent Scott.

90
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,321
Sorry for your loss.

91
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,583
Just tell me what happened.

92
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,280
We think somebody
might have planted

93
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,543
an incendiary device
in the vehicle.

94
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,111
Is this a case
of a crazy person

95
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,721
going after postal workers

96
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,288
because the letter
took too long?

97
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,594
We're looking into it, OK?

98
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:08,769
We got a full team
working on this--

99
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,555
FBI, ATF,
U.S. postal inspector.

100
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:15,079
Was Vicky working her
regular route this morning?

101
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,256
Yeah, she was on her way
to pick me up for lunch

102
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,735
like we do every day.

103
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:22,086
We were on the phone,
talking about where.

104
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,871
When this happened?

105
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,742
Did she say she saw
anyone near her truck?

106
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,136
No.

107
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:31,139
All she said was
her seat was wet

108
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,967
and it smelled like gasoline,

109
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:38,059
and then hearing her scream

110
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,281
and not being able to help
my little girl.

111
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,982
I want to help.

112
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,332
Well, if you want to help,
you can start by telling us,

113
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,943
had she received
any threats recently?

114
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,772
You think this could
have been personal?

115
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:00,342
She was seeing
this guy, Anthony--

116
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,083
real piece of work.

117
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:04,694
Is he African American,
medium build?

118
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,262
Yeah.

119
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,397
Sir, if you'd come with me,
I'd like to get some more info.

120
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,661
ATF is 20 minutes out.

121
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,489
Ray is stuck in traffic,
but right behind them.

122
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,620
Hana is looking
into an ex-boyfriend

123
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,882
who might be good for this.

124
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,057
Send it to Ray.

125
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,798
Barnes and I will canvass
the neighborhood

126
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,497
while we wait
for ATF to show up.

127
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,201
Robert Jimenez?

128
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,507
Yeah, that's me.

129
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:35,812
What do we got so far?

130
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,336
The char depth
and burn pattern say

131
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,773
the fire originated
right behind the driver's seat.

132
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,949
There's traces
of an accelerant as well.

133
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,559
That's right--gasoline.

134
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,995
Our victim was on the phone to
her father when it happened.

135
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,301
She said she smelled it.

136
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,389
A witness saw a guy
dropping off a package

137
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,782
wrapped in duct tape.

138
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,174
Is that what the bomb was in?

139
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,393
Could be.

140
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,481
I found silver fibers
under the remnants

141
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,222
of a crude fire starter.

142
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:56,485
Crude.
What do you mean, crude?

143
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,269
The device is
on a time delay,

144
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,836
not remotely operated.

145
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,795
He probably stuffed
a shoe box with paper

146
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,450
or some flammable material,
tied a lit cigarette

147
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,103
to a bunch of matches,
and dropped it in.

148
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:07,496
I found the match heads--

149
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:08,628
simple, but lethal.

150
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,064
Matches and cigarettes.

151
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,849
Why does that ring a bell?

152
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,330
You're thinking
of John Leonard Orr.

153
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:16,679
Who's that?

154
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,115
He was a California
fire captain

155
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,769
who set about 2,000 fires.

156
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,511
Same deal--he tied a lit
cigarette to a few matches.

157
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,817
He left a fingerprint

158
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,079
on a piece of paper
that didn't burn.

159
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,734
That's how they caught
the son of a bitch.

160
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,039
We're not that lucky.

161
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,476
No prints.

162
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,173
But the match heads were
embedded in something.

163
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,001
Any idea what?

164
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,220
Water-gel explosive
would be my guess.

165
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,657
Something like Tovarc.

166
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,049
It's like dynamite,

167
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,442
except a lot more stable
to transport

168
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,878
and safer to handle.

169
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,185
Adding Tovarc to gasoline
and a basic fire starter--

170
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:47,536
your guy wanted to make sure
this fire burned hard and long.

171
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,582
How do you get
your hands on Tovarc?

172
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,714
You have to have
a license to purchase it.

173
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,976
But it's not for laymen.

174
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,848
And I bet your arsonist
is a layman.

175
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,241
What makes you say that?

176
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,679
You use an explosive
to make things explode, right?

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,203
But Tovarc needs
a secondary charge to go off.

178
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:05,902
Without that, it burns up
instead of exploding.

179
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,861
You think our fugitive
was looking for a big bang,

180
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:10,211
and all he got was a big fire.

181
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,300
Any updates,
I want to be the first to know.

182
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,433
Thank you.

183
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,651
Any news on Vicky's ex?

184
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,044
It wasn't him.

185
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,088
He's been at the dentist

186
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,176
getting his
wisdom teeth pulled.

187
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,439
He's still there.

188
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,615
OK. So far,
we got a Black male fugitive

189
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:26,096
with access to a water-gel
explosive, maybe Tovarc.

190
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:28,882
There's a million ways
to make something explode.

191
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,753
This joker has a signature.

192
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,626
I'll check with ViCAP
and BATS for past arsons

193
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,672
involving explosives, see
if they can find me a match.

194
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,761
I want to nail this piece
of garbage to the wall.

195
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,763
You come after one
federal employee,

196
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,113
you come after all of us.

197
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,528
William, you back already?

198
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,748
William?

199
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,968
William, that you?

200
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,628
Ugh, dang it.

201
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,590
Help me.

202
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:28,202
I need help!

203
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,254
Oh, help!

204
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,967
Mr. Rayson didn't make it?

205
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,621
Smoke inhalation.

206
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,013
Sorry to hear that.

207
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,319
I tell people all the time,

208
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,929
smoke can be way more
dangerous than fire.

209
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,104
You find anything?

210
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:02,628
Yeah, we got lucky.

211
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:05,065
The arsonist left the package
at the kitchen back door.

212
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,675
And this time, it didn't
completely burn up.

213
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,156
Can you confirm that
this is the same arsonist

214
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:10,853
that hit the postal truck
this morning?

215
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:13,595
Not 100% sure, but there were
more traces of the water gel.

216
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,510
I'll compare it to what
I found on the truck.

217
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,252
Remy, a neighbor
walking her dog

218
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:20,341
noticed a gray Corolla
with a Black male driver

219
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,429
circling the block.

220
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,952
The driver looked lost.

221
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:26,652
NYPD is canvassing to see if
any cameras picked him up.

222
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,610
Is that a witness?

223
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,178
Victim's son.

224
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:36,052
Agent Scott and Barnes, FBI.

225
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:39,055
We're very sorry
about your father.

226
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,622
I should have stayed
at home today.

227
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,145
I never should have
left him alone.

228
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,669
Were you his
primary caretaker?

229
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,019
No, he had a nurse
who came four times a week.

230
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,890
I work at a cement plant
near here.

231
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,936
Is that where you were today?

232
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,198
No.

233
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,721
It was my day off.

234
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,071
My buddy had an extra pass
to Ridgeland.

235
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:56,638
That's a golf club
for members only.

236
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,382
I jumped at the chance,
but I wish I hadn't.

237
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,602
Did your father know
this woman?

238
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,038
I doubt it.

239
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,518
I wished he would have got
out more, made friends.

240
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,650
But with his health issues,

241
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,043
it just made everything
so tough on him.

242
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,218
I think he missed his partner.

243
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:12,567
He had a partner?

244
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,613
No, not that kind of partner.

245
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,877
He was a cop for 30 years
before turning in his badge.

246
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,226
Was he a cop here?

247
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:20,531
No, Philadelphia.

248
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,533
He was head
of the aviation unit.

249
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,187
OK. Thank you, Mr. Rayson.

250
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,625
We appreciate
your father's service.

251
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,106
Hey, Remy. What's up?

252
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:34,154
Our latest victim is a cop
from Philly named Finn Rayson.

253
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,286
And Vicky's dad,
Caleb Collins,

254
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:39,376
was with the Philadelphia
Fire Department.

255
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,987
OK, so Finn is a cop.

256
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,553
And Collins is a firefighter.

257
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,164
They often respond
to calls together.

258
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,426
Well, depending
on the precinct

259
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:46,906
and the fire station
they were at,

260
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:49,038
they could have responded
to dozens of calls together.

261
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,432
We need to figure out
what the hell connected them.

262
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,695
According to
employee records,

263
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,828
they had an overlap
in Philadelphia

264
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,830
between 1984 and 1989.

265
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,919
I'm going to start
digging into that.

266
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,664
Looks like our gel
substance is Tovarc,

267
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,013
but our arsonist
had the foresight

268
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,405
to remove its cartridge.

269
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,016
What does that mean?

270
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:12,409
We can't track down where
our fugitive purchased it.

271
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,716
But Robert can see if
he can salvage the taggant.

272
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,370
And taggant is?

273
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,980
It's a microscopic
fingerprint.

274
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,939
It's a unique physical marker
they put in products

275
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,680
to authenticate them.

276
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,769
If he can find it, we'll know
where the Tovarc came from.

277
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,756
Why the hell are you
following me?

278
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,887
Who are you?

279
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:01,127
It's pretty brave of you to
confront a stranger like that.

280
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,520
You never know what people
are capable of these days.

281
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,957
That's why I got my gun.

282
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,785
Well, they say, "Don't
bring a knife to a gunfight."

283
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,179
You brought a gun to confront
a potential bomber.

284
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,572
What do you mean?

285
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,879
The guy killed two people
using arson.

286
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,968
He uses explosives
to start the fires.

287
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:18,318
We think that he was
driving a gray Corolla

288
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:19,885
like the one that
you reported seeing.

289
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,321
No kidding.

290
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:22,757
I thought he was
some psycho driver

291
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,106
I accidentally cut off
on my run.

292
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,848
I got a look at his plates
before he drove off.

293
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,895
RY65C4JXM.

294
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,331
That's a good eye.

295
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,333
We'll run these numbers,
see if we can ID the guy.

296
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,989
Do you, by chance, have any
connection to Philadelphia?

297
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,165
You're kidding, right?

298
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,949
My granddad was
Eric Raymond, Sr.

299
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,952
He was the mayor of
Philadelphia in the '80s.

300
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,302
All right.
So what about you personally?

301
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,087
From Brooklyn,
born and raised.

302
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:51,003
My folks left Philly as soon as
my grandfather's term was up.

303
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:54,310
They wanted to get away
from the bad memories.

304
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,356
What bad memories?

305
00:13:56,357 --> 00:14:00,099
He was the Philly mayor
in 1985,

306
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,406
when the MOVE bombing happened.

307
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:06,322
What happened again?

308
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,629
MOVE is a communal
Black liberation

309
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,674
and environmentalist
organization

310
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,590
founded in the 1970s
by a man

311
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,810
who renamed himself
John Africa.

312
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,464
Yeah, my dad wasn't
a member of MOVE,

313
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,857
but he liked parts
of their cause.

314
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,946
They're a religious,
pro-nature community.

315
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,383
Well, apparently
they rejected modern life

316
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,515
and dependence on technology.

317
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,648
This "Guardian" article says
that they were a mix

318
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,737
of Black power
and flower power.

319
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,478
That's what got them
in trouble with the cops.

320
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,088
Yeah, Philly PD
and the mayor didn't like

321
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,134
the demonstrations of protest
that they were putting on.

322
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:37,484
In the late '70s, there were
several violent clashes

323
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:38,920
between MOVE and the police,

324
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,488
which led
to what happened next.

325
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:45,709
In May, 1985,
Philly PD dropped a C4 bomb

326
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,931
on one of the homes
occupied by MOVE.

327
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:54,501
Police bombed American
citizens on American soil?

328
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,590
I saw the news coverage.

329
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,635
That neighborhood was
totally decimated.

330
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,376
That's a lot of destruction.

331
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:01,595
I mean, how big was this bomb?

332
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:04,119
Big enough to clear
three city blocks.

333
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,905
There was a gas-powered
generator in one of the homes.

334
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,819
The founder
of MOVE was killed

335
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,432
along with five adults
and five kids.

336
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,697
That's got to be
our connection.

337
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,700
I bet Caleb Collins was
a firefighter at the scene.

338
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,702
And Eric Sr. was
the mayor at the time,

339
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,182
so he signed off
on the bombing.

340
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,400
And get this.

341
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,185
Finn Rayson flew the helicopter

342
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:27,490
that dropped the bomb.

343
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:30,406
The bomb was a mixture
of C-4 and Tovarc.

344
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:32,626
Maybe our arsonist
is a MOVE member.

345
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,889
Starting these fires could
be his way of retaliating

346
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,021
for the bombing.

347
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,587
I mean, is MOVE
still around today?

348
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,459
I can't seem to find
much about it online.

349
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,809
They used to have a website,
but it's a broken link now.

350
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,987
But the domain still exists,
so someone's paying for it.

351
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,383
That would be Gretchen Smith.

352
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,689
She's a violin teacher
in Manhattan.

353
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,995
All right, it's late.

354
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,085
Let's pack up, go see
Gretchen in the morning.

355
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,745
I thought MOVE was supposed
to be anti-technology.

356
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,008
How does having a website
fit into that?

357
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,750
MOVE was founded before the
personal computer was invented.

358
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,752
We had to evolve to survive.
- We?

359
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,275
You weren't even born
when MOVE was active.

360
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,885
Same crap, different decade.

361
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,018
We peace-loving folks
are still dealing

362
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,107
with police brutality
and oppression.

363
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,979
That's why I'm trying
to keep MOVE alive.

364
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,807
What does MOVE
look like today?

365
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,374
Some of us meet
informally now and then,

366
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,985
but there's no main group

367
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,551
spearheading events
or anything.

368
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:29,900
Given what
happened before, I--

369
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,077
I think that's for the best.

370
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,600
You're like everyone else
who wants to make us

371
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,297
go away permanently.

372
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,733
And they tried before.

373
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,300
Let's not forget
that the U.S. government

374
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,086
bombed its own citizens
and killed five kids.

375
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,783
We believe
a MOVE member might

376
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:45,394
be trying to avenge that
tragedy by setting these fires.

377
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,918
He's already killed two people.

378
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,009
I don't know
anything about that.

379
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:52,749
We want a list
of all MOVE affiliates

380
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,055
you've been in touch with.

381
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:57,102
As if I'd hand that over
without a warrant.

382
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,799
Yeah.

383
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,280
It's the FBI who supplied
the bomb to the Philly PD

384
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,803
in the first place.

385
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,979
And when they dropped the bomb,
the police shot at folks

386
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,285
trying to flee
the burning building.

387
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:07,503
Allegedly.

388
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:08,504
There are some accounts
that say that

389
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:10,985
MOVE shot at the cops first.

390
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,421
Allegedly.

391
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,770
Whose side are you on?

392
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,512
The innocent.

393
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,995
How does your dad feel
about MOVE now?

394
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:22,692
Probably the same way I do.

395
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,825
It's important
we don't just gloss over

396
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:25,869
everything that happened.

397
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,001
History cannot repeat itself.

398
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,350
Hey, Hana.
What's up?

399
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:29,612
I'm sending you a list

400
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,832
of MOVE affiliates in the area.

401
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,312
How'd you get
your hands on that?

402
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:35,357
I tracked the IP address
of every device

403
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,011
that visited the MOVE website
when it was still up.

404
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,144
Do any of these people own
a gray Corolla?

405
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,754
Unfortunately, no.

406
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,365
The license plate came back
as stolen from a Honda Accord.

407
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,758
The car is a dead lead.

408
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,542
And there are over
20 names on the list.

409
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,717
Who would you start with?

410
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:50,242
Ayo Parsons in Queens.

411
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,461
She was one of the original
members of MOVE

412
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,246
and one of the founder's
relatives.

413
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,552
She might have insight
into our unsub.

414
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,686
Have Ray and Nina
head over there now.

415
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,471
So this is Ayo Parsons.

416
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:03,864
She's formerly known
as Ayo Africa.

417
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:06,867
She was arrested in 1978
for taking part in a riot

418
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,695
that left one
police officer dead.

419
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,392
- She's out on parole?
- Yeah.

420
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:11,698
She was released last year.

421
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:12,829
She changed
her maiden name back

422
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,181
and has been laying low
ever since.

423
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:21,403
You think that's our guy?

424
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,926
I don't know.

425
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:25,277
Well, what makes you
think that's him?

426
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:26,801
Gut feeling.

427
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:33,763
Yep, that's him. Hey.

428
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,113
Come here. Hey!

429
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,331
FBI. Come here.

430
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,490
- Hey!
- Hey!

431
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,013
- Move!
- Watch out!

432
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,580
- Hey!
- I'm trying to go!

433
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,589
- Hey!
- What the hell?

434
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,896
- What are you doing?
- Hey, watch it!

435
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:22,943
Hey, look out!
Hey, move!

436
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,118
Move, move!
- Look out!

437
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,250
Watch out.
Watch out.

438
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,425
Hey, stop the car!

439
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,166
Hey, hey!

440
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,820
Get down.

441
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,391
Damn it.

442
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,702
I've been reviewing
the security footage

443
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,659
from the café,
but I haven't been able

444
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,052
to get a good look at his face.

445
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,228
Well, I did get a good look
in this guy's car.

446
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,143
It was a mess,
like he's living out of it.

447
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,797
Yeah.
We think he might be homeless.

448
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:52,929
Depending how long this whack
job has been on the street,

449
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,932
it's going to be tough to ID
him without a home address.

450
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,412
Is that a work shirt?

451
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,935
Can we zoom in on that?

452
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,242
Mm-hmm.

453
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:06,552
Barco Security.

454
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,728
I've got a Barcolo Security.

455
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,208
It's the same logo.

456
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,210
They provide services
nationwide to businesses

457
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,907
like malls and banks.

458
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,038
I'm going to start looking

459
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,126
through their
employee database.

460
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,129
It's Robert from ATF.

461
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,348
All right.

462
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,872
So this guy was
targeting MOVE members.

463
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,267
Safe to say that he's probably
not down for the cause.

464
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,139
What if he was on his way
to meet her,

465
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,619
and she's covering for him?

466
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,274
Well, we spoke with Ayo,
and she put MOVE behind her.

467
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,536
Ever since
she got out on parole,

468
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,929
she just wants
to be with family

469
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,060
and catch up on lost time.

470
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,628
Maybe this guy
isn't part of MOVE.

471
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,500
But the threads keep
connecting him to the bombing.

472
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,066
Who else was impacted by this?

473
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,503
Along with 11 MOVE members,

474
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,374
the fire spread
to 60 other row houses.

475
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,246
Yeah.
200 people lost their homes.

476
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,378
That makes for a lot
of potential suspects.

477
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,946
OK, so Robert zeroed in
on the taggant

478
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,339
from the Rayson crime scene.

479
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,992
It's part of a bulk order
purchased by

480
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,125
a construction company
that does road work

481
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,996
up and down
the Eastern seaboard.

482
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,651
That gets us closer,
but not close enough.

483
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,610
Can we see if that
construction company

484
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,786
used Barcolo
for their security?

485
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,091
I'll do you one better.

486
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,877
I think I may have the guy.

487
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,270
Yeah, that's him.

488
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,533
Gerald Colworth
of Long Island City.

489
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,361
He was a security guard
up until six months ago,

490
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,971
when he was fired.

491
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:21,279
He registered a gray
Toyota Corolla with Barcolo

492
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,802
to get a parking pass for work.

493
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,718
But the car was actually
registered to his ex-wife,

494
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,328
Leticia Colworth.

495
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,200
They had two kids together
before they divorced last year.

496
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,941
Let's go talk to the ex.

497
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,335
Get a handle on how this dude
went from married father of two

498
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,858
to homeless arsonist.

499
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,599
I'm going to talk
to his boss at Barcolo.

500
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,036
I'll work on finding out
exactly how Colworth is

501
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,516
connected to the MOVE bombing.

502
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:42,996
I want to know how much
Tovarc this guy's

503
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:44,606
got in his arsenal.

504
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,174
If he figures out how to make
this bomb blow up right,

505
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:49,045
we're all in serious trouble.

506
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,008
Gerald worked for you
for five years

507
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,792
before you suddenly fired him.

508
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:57,880
What happened?

509
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,360
It wasn't sudden.

510
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,970
I liked Gerry.

511
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:05,148
Even when he started coming in
late, I cut him some slack.

512
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:06,715
I've been divorced.

513
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,675
I know how it rips you open
and tears you up inside.

514
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:12,373
But a few months later,
he ran out of slack?

515
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,201
Just missed too many shifts.

516
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,594
I couldn't depend
on him at all.

517
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:18,031
Management has me
taking shifts now.

518
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:20,250
I need reliable guys.

519
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,122
I fired Gerry last July.

520
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:25,168
That's right when he stopped
his mortgage payments.

521
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,431
He lost his house
to foreclosure

522
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,563
a couple months later.

523
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,565
That's the wheel
of capitalism for you.

524
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:34,395
It'll grind you into the dust
before it stops.

525
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,572
But, hey, look,
I'm sorry about Gerry.

526
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,096
He seemed like a good guy,
a family man.

527
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:41,881
When he worked here,
did the company report

528
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:43,752
any thefts from any
of your inventory?

529
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:45,711
We think he might have
stolen some of the explosives

530
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:47,539
they use here, like Tovarc.

531
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,541
We run inventory every week.

532
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,412
Nothing has been
reported stolen--

533
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,283
definitely not Tovarc.
- OK.

534
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,763
Well, triple check
that inventory.

535
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:58,027
And if you come short on
anything, even a tiny amount,

536
00:22:58,028 --> 00:22:59,856
call us right away, OK?

537
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,601
I don't know
what I can tell you.

538
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,777
Gerry and I have been
divorced for a year.

539
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:11,432
Did he ever talk about
the 1985 MOVE bombing?

540
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,694
A little.

541
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,130
I always wished
he'd open up more.

542
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,436
It's what broke us up.

543
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:18,047
Did Gerry and his family
belong to MOVE?

544
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,834
Kids, wait for me.

545
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:25,446
No, Gerry has nothing
to do with that.

546
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,448
But his family lived
on that block.

547
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,668
And what happened in 1985,
it destroyed them.

548
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,626
Their house burned down, right?

549
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,062
Yes, but it wasn't about
losing the house.

550
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,803
It was about losing his home.

551
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:37,806
Gerry's parents
never recovered.

552
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,461
They had a really
ugly split-up.

553
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,550
When we first met,
Gerry promised

554
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,423
he'd never let that happen.

555
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,642
He said we'd never,
ever get a divorce.

556
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:51,341
We all get married thinking
it'll never happen to us.

557
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,432
Until it does, right?

558
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:56,956
I filed for divorce last year,

559
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:59,132
but I stayed close by
for the kids.

560
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,307
Do you guys share custody?

561
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,656
For now.

562
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,658
But since he lost his job
and then the house--

563
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,268
if the kids have nowhere
to stay with him,

564
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,748
I might as well
move to Phoenix.

565
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:08,402
My sister lives out there.

566
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,839
It's so much cheaper.

567
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,886
Does Gerry know you want
custody of the kids?

568
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,496
I'm not trying
to blindside him.

569
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,672
I told him a few weeks ago.

570
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,848
And how did he react?

571
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:22,634
Worse than when I told him
I wanted a divorce.

572
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:25,680
Back then, I had to hide
all the meds in our house.

573
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,029
I was scared
he might do something

574
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,335
he couldn't take back.

575
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,642
He already has.

576
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,429
Two people are dead.

577
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,433
What?

578
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:44,090
Our kids are Gerry's world.

579
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,613
And they adore him back.

580
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:48,486
When they find out what
he's done, it'll destroy them.

581
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,400
When's the last time
you spoke with him?

582
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:52,228
A couple weeks ago.

583
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,448
Gerry called me from a number
I didn't recognize.

584
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,538
Let's give it a try.

585
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,977
Brooklyn Men's
Emergency Shelter.

586
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,937
Aditi speaking.

587
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:07,026
Ray and Barnes are
back here on speaker.

588
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:09,724
Gerry was eight when
they lost their family home.

589
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:10,986
His family was involved
in a lawsuit

590
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:12,422
against the city
of Philadelphia

591
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:13,772
and the police department.

592
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,643
Since Gerry can't provide
a stable home,

593
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:18,080
his wife is suing him for
full custody of their kids.

594
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,560
That kind of mirrors
what happened to him

595
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,953
when he was little.

596
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:23,738
Yeah, look, the police bombed
MOVE headquarters.

597
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,348
Gerry loses his childhood home.

598
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:26,785
Then he loses his family.

599
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:29,483
So it's happening again
to him 40 years later.

600
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,093
That must be
what triggered him.

601
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,617
After his house was
foreclosed,

602
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,792
Gerry stayed
at a men's shelter.

603
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,271
We just spoke to the director.

604
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:36,795
Yeah, you think he's going
after the shelter next?

605
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:38,100
They've been alerted.

606
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,580
Gerry even brought his
kids there and pretended

607
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,103
it was a weekend excursion.

608
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,453
The shelter has
a strict no-kids policy,

609
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,716
so they had to ask Gerry
to leave.

610
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,718
And he hasn't been back since.

611
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:49,416
Hmm. That's harsh.

612
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,460
All right.

613
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,767
So no family, no home.

614
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,508
This guy's got nothing to lose.

615
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:55,944
Where's he going next?

616
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:57,598
The shelter director
said that Gerry was friendly

617
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,208
with a guy named Trent
who comes around

618
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,341
for a hot meal,
but also keeps a spot

619
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,212
at an encampment in Astoria.

620
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,562
Sending you the cross streets.

621
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,911
Meet us there.

622
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:07,870
All right.

623
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,612
Oh, Hana.

624
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,309
Ethan's calling you.

625
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,834
Here.

626
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,881
You're not going to answer it?

627
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:20,969
Nope.

628
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,623
We broke up two weeks ago.

629
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,321
Oh, Hana, I'm so sorry.

630
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:26,584
There were signs.

631
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,542
I missed them.
- What kind of signs?

632
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,499
I don't want
to talk about it.

633
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,633
Yeah, of course.

634
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,681
Have you seen this guy?

635
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:38,987
Have you seen this man?

636
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:40,641
OK. Thank you.

637
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,816
Nobody recognizes him.

638
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:42,904
At least that's what they say.

639
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,340
Half of them won't even talk.

640
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,777
They don't trust the badge.

641
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:47,213
I mean, every major city,
cops are constantly

642
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:48,780
harassing them,
making them move around,

643
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,259
set up camps
in different places.

644
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,739
That's why MOVE
didn't trust the cops--

645
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,741
the constant harassment.

646
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,264
It's Horus, Gerry's old boss.

647
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:56,831
All right.

648
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,441
Remy's found Trent.

649
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,443
Oh, great.

650
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:02,402
How well do you know Gerry?

651
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,012
You know, about as well as

652
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,753
you get to know the guy
who's stuck in the same

653
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:07,276
sinking boat with you.

654
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,715
It must be pretty hard

655
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:12,455
to get a decent night's
sleep around here.

656
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,805
Why do you stay?

657
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,458
Yeah, it's just noise,
you know.

658
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,634
Better than camping out
someplace

659
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,331
quiet and residential.

660
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,029
And you always got
the cops on your ass.

661
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,032
OK, so you're here because
the neighbors don't complain.

662
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,731
Out of sight, out of mind,
which is exactly

663
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:28,863
how the public likes
their homeless, right?

664
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:32,345
Oh, I'm sorry, the unhoused,
as though semantics

665
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,826
are going to put a freaking
roof over our heads.

666
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:37,089
Is that what you
and Gerry talked about?

667
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,179
Yeah, I mean,
I'm over it, man.

668
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,008
But Gerry...

669
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:46,054
He would get all riled up.

670
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:48,927
He talks about how
the police and politicians,

671
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:51,799
they don't want to do their
jobs, yada, yada, you know.

672
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,148
You talking about
the housing crisis?

673
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:55,585
I'm talking about
any crisis, man.

674
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:56,891
Not like we elected them
to put out

675
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,414
these kind of fires
or anything.

676
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:01,287
Though, if you ask Gerry,

677
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,202
he'd say they wouldn't
put out a fire

678
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:06,466
even if that was
exactly their job.

679
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,294
What do you mean by that?

680
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,165
His house burned down
when he was a kid.

681
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,602
He said the firefighters,
they showed up.

682
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,256
They just stood around

683
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,956
and watched that baby
burn to the ground.

684
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,742
So that was Gerry's old boss.

685
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,962
He said all of the Tovarc
is accounted for.

686
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:26,921
However, a spool of det cord
went missing in the last day.

687
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,097
They never changed the locks
after Gerry got fired,

688
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:31,621
so he could have used
his key to steal it.

689
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,232
What's det cord?

690
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,668
It's a detonation cord.

691
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:36,322
Yeah, that's uh--
it's a tiny little tube

692
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:37,976
filled with explosives.

693
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,455
We used to use that
back in Afghan

694
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,761
to blow up expired ordnance.

695
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,110
The arson investigator
said that Tovarc

696
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:44,634
needs a secondary explosive
to be triggered.

697
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:45,940
Would det cord work?

698
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,942
It's exactly
what det cord's for.

699
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,771
Turn a little kaboom
into a big kaboom.

700
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,077
No big deal.

701
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,992
That whole blast
you heard earlier--

702
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,384
I mean, you got those
construction crews.

703
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:58,737
They're running det cord
and Tovarc every damn day.

704
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:01,956
OK.

705
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,784
So Gerry could have gotten
the Tovarc from anywhere,

706
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,307
including that
construction site.

707
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,396
Yeah, but he didn't know
he needed the det cord

708
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:08,789
to make it explode.

709
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,486
Until he saw the first
two arsons were fires,

710
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:11,879
not explosions.

711
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,489
Now that he has
these two ingredients,

712
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,145
it's only a matter of time
before the big kaboom.

713
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:21,933
Gerry told a friend that
when his house burned down,

714
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,064
the fire department just
stood by and did nothing.

715
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,109
Is that true?

716
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,501
You don't understand.

717
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:26,807
You're asking me
about something

718
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,288
that happened 40 years ago.

719
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:30,680
I don't remember the details.

720
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,160
We're not passing judgment.

721
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,597
We just need to know
what really happened.

722
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,078
It was my second year
on the job.

723
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,340
I was following orders.

724
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,081
What were your orders?

725
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,430
To stand down.

726
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,085
No one expected the fire
to get so out of control.

727
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,565
It got out of control

728
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,959
because you didn't do
anything to stop it.

729
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,135
It was a mess.

730
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:52,441
My lieutenant called it
a war zone.

731
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:55,270
And this is the guy that
did two tours in Vietnam.

732
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,837
Bullets were flying.

733
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,099
Who started the shooting?

734
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,622
Depends on who you ask.

735
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:03,104
Some folks say the cops were
shooting at the MOVE folks

736
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,714
trying to escape the fire.

737
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:08,631
And the cops say
MOVE fired at them first.

738
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:11,939
Now, what were we
supposed to do?

739
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,464
We couldn't disobey
the fire commissioner.

740
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,292
Is he the one
who gave the order?

741
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,424
As far as I know,
he was given that order

742
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,774
by the police commissioner.

743
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:29,087
Is this why
my daughter was killed?

744
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:32,699
Over something I did
four decades ago?

745
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,048
No.

746
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,356
It's over what you didn't do.

747
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,317
Gerry went after a firefighter
at the scene--

748
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,710
the helicopter pilot
who dropped the bomb,

749
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,016
then the mayor.

750
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,669
He's working his way
up the chain of command.

751
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,236
Contact the fire
and police commissioners.

752
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:49,542
We got to warn them.

753
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,326
The Philadelphia police
commissioner in 1985

754
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:52,980
was Victor Kipling.

755
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,374
He lives in a senior community
in New Rochelle.

756
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,202
Fire commissioner
is in New York now.

757
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,638
His last known is in Brooklyn.

758
00:30:58,639 --> 00:30:59,987
You and Ray go see
the fire commissioner.

759
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,423
The rest of you, with me.

760
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,520
Damn incident
derailed my career.

761
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,131
By incident, you mean
the bomb you ordered

762
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:14,349
that killed 11 people?

763
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,221
It wasn't just any person.

764
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:19,354
They were disrupting the city
and endangering the police.

765
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:20,573
What about the five kids?

766
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,010
How were they
endangering the police?

767
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:25,926
I mean, those five kids weren't
the only collateral damage.

768
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:29,016
200 homes burnt that day.

769
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,017
This is Gerry Colworth.

770
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,279
He lost his childhood home.

771
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,759
Do you recognize him?

772
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,369
No.

773
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,589
But I do remember
the Colworth name.

774
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,373
His parents were part
of a lawsuit against the city

775
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,071
and your police department.

776
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,682
That's right.

777
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:47,556
First time I saw her in court,
Loretta Colworth was pregnant.

778
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,909
They told me she had
a miscarriage later.

779
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,610
Family blamed it on the stress
from losing their house.

780
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:05,226
Look, we never meant
to hurt any kids,

781
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:09,056
but they shouldn't have been in
that house in the first place.

782
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:12,320
If I was their parents,
I would never forgive myself

783
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:15,672
for putting my kids
in danger's way.

784
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,764
There's nothing worse

785
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,290
than seeing somebody you love
get hurt,

786
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,467
especially if it's your fault.

787
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:38,520
You know, we've assumed that

788
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,174
Gerry was going after
the people

789
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,741
who were responsible
for the bombing.

790
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:44,091
But what if he's actually
going after their loved ones?

791
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,745
Collateral damage.

792
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:47,965
That's a worse punishment than
going after people themselves.

793
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,792
We thought he was
going after the dad,

794
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,707
but maybe he was going
after Vicki all along.

795
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,971
He didn't mix up Eric Junior,
by the way.

796
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,712
He was stalking the mayor's
grandson on purpose.

797
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,584
And Finn Rayson's son
was supposed to be home

798
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:00,020
when Gerry set that fire.

799
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,372
What's up, Ray?

800
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:06,113
We got a BOLO hit on
Gerald's car in the Bronx.

801
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:07,158
We're headed there now.

802
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,682
I'll drop you a location pin.

803
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,816
Bring around the Tahoe.

804
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,949
Isn't that where
the fire commissioner lives?

805
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,124
House sitter said
he's out of town.

806
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,734
He and his wife are in Florida.

807
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:20,693
Does he have relatives
in the Bronx?

808
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,608
We think Gerry's going
after the family members

809
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,610
of the people responsible
for the bombing.

810
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:26,916
His car is parked in
a dense residential area.

811
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,570
If we have to account
for relatives,

812
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,486
it will take time
to figure out who he's after.

813
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:37,405
They found our fugitive's
car in the Bronx.

814
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,277
Where in the Bronx?

815
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,323
My granddaughter lives there.

816
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,775
Maya Kipling?

817
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:02,388
FBI.

818
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:04,389
Can I help you?

819
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,696
I'm Special Agent Remy Scott.

820
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,351
Is somebody already in there?

821
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:11,526
We're fine.

822
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,919
It's all we have, Billy.

823
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,529
Let's go upstairs.

824
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,184
Are there kids in there?

825
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:19,360
Um--

826
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:21,059
We think you might be
in danger.

827
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,720
This is my cousin Terry.

828
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:33,113
She helps me out sometimes.

829
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,375
Helps you out with what?

830
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,681
Are you running
a daycare from your house?

831
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,030
I'm going to get a license.

832
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,205
I just haven't gotten
around to it yet.

833
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:39,337
We're the FBI, not the IRS.

834
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:40,338
We don't care about that.

835
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,948
Are you in trouble?

836
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,080
It's fine.

837
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,559
Go help Angela start
quiet hour, OK?

838
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,301
Just let me talk to them.

839
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,129
So what's going on?

840
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,827
A serial arsonist might be
targeting your home.

841
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:52,872
What?

842
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:54,091
How many kids
do you have here?

843
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,309
We have six today.

844
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,745
Angela and Terry are
with them upstairs.

845
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:58,269
OK. I need you to contact
their parents

846
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,661
and have them pick them up now.

847
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:01,534
- Are you sure?
- Get them out.

848
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,375
Angela?

849
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,593
Angela, bring the kids down.
Come on.

850
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:21,030
Come on. Come on, honey. Yes.

851
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:22,249
Yeah, come on. Come on.

852
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,555
It's OK.
Let's head outside, all right?

853
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,252
We got a fire in here.

854
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,645
Get them out.
- We're going to head out.

855
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:27,733
Head out. There's a fire.

856
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,865
Let's go, all right?

857
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,128
Come on, guys,
we gotta get out.

858
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,216
Come on, come on.

859
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,565
Keep going down the stairs.

860
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,915
What happened?
Whose kids are these?

861
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,612
She runs a daycare in there.
We got to get them out of here.

862
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:38,613
I got them.

863
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:41,094
Come on.
- Where's Terry?

864
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:42,487
- What?
- I don't know.

865
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:43,749
I just grabbed the kids.
- OK.

866
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,098
I got her. Go, go.

867
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,186
- Nina.
- I got her.

868
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,231
We got two inside.

869
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,754
One's an FBI agent.

870
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:49,755
Fire in the back.

871
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:55,021
He's on the roof!

872
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,677
Hey.

873
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:01,593
Hey...[coughs] Terry.

874
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:02,724
Terry, wake up.

875
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:03,769
Come on.

876
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,162
Come on.

877
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,076
I'm going to get you
out of here.

878
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,077
Get down!

879
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:27,227
Guys, where is he?

880
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,664
Across the street
on the roof.

881
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:31,623
Cover us.

882
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,191
OK.

883
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:36,976
Stay with me.

884
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:38,456
I'm right here.

885
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:39,892
Cover your mouth.
Cover your mouth.

886
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:44,026
Guys, we gotta
get out of here.

887
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,165
They're firing at us!

888
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:59,259
You guys go that way.
I'll circle around.

889
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,608
Nina, you're clear.

890
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:01,609
Get out of there.

891
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,916
Come on, come on.

892
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,134
Come on.

893
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,620
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

894
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,535
I got you. I got you.

895
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:17,278
We need help--
medical assistance!

896
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:24,676
FBI.

897
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,982
You're stuck between a rock
and a hard place, Gerry.

898
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:28,462
How does it feel?

899
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,247
Like any other day
in the life.

900
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,944
We don't want
to shoot you, Gerry.

901
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:32,988
Don't give us a reason to.

902
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:34,207
Put the gun down.

903
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,382
Enough people have been hurt.

904
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,689
All right?
This ain't '85 back in Philly.

905
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,647
They took a lot from you.

906
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:40,648
Never made things right.

907
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:41,997
They never do.

908
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:44,522
But you can make things
right for your kids now.

909
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:47,046
Do you have any idea
how it feels

910
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:49,831
not being able to give them
a home, keep them safe,

911
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,442
keep our family together?

912
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:54,967
No, but I know four walls
and a roof don't make a home.

913
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,185
Showing up for them does.

914
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:57,926
I did everything
for my family!

915
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,059
That doesn't concern me.

916
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,539
Drop your weapon.

917
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,063
And then what?

918
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:06,284
I'm drowning, man.

919
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:12,027
All my life has been
one thing after the other,

920
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:14,116
like everyone is
at the pool party,

921
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:16,336
and I'm underwater
in the deep end.

922
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:19,297
And by the time
anyone thinks of me,

923
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,995
I'll be nothing
but an air bubble.

924
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:26,738
You got our attention.

925
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,568
But you got to think
about your kids.

926
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:32,091
I don't want to have
to explain to them

927
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:34,311
why my partner shot you.

928
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,275
Come on, Gerry.

929
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:44,103
Break the cycle.

930
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:47,367
Put the gun down.

931
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,934
Man, I'm not letting you
go out like this.

932
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:51,198
Put the gun down.

933
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:06,821
Hands behind your head.

934
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,780
Let's go.

935
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,325
Thank you
for staying so late.

936
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,326
I appreciate it.

937
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,458
Of course.

938
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:35,807
Dougie's an easy-going kid.

939
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:37,504
Yeah, he gets that
one from his dad.

940
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:39,811
Good night.
- Night.

941
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,086
Hi. How'd it go with Brett?

942
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,783
Marina--Nina, it's me.

943
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:58,133
- Dad?
- Listen, don't hang up.

944
00:39:58,134 --> 00:40:00,353
Oh, no, you do not get
to call me from Tink's phone.

945
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:01,789
You want to talk?

946
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,400
Have the balls to call me
from your own phone.

947
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,446
Just listen, please.

948
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,492
I'm at the hospital.

949
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,102
Tink and Brett got into it.

950
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,191
And evidently, he knocked
her around quite a bit.

951
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,584
What? What?

952
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,847
What do you mean
he knocked her around?

953
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,022
He hit her?

954
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,502
How bad is it?

955
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,373
Bad enough that even though

956
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:23,071
she's not going
to press charges,

957
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:24,508
the boys down at the station

958
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,161
are going to keep him
locked up

959
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:31,471
in the drunk tank overnight
for his own safety.

960
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,691
Yeah, because we're really
concerned with his safety.

961
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:35,693
Come on.

962
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,303
Hey, can you stay?
- Yeah.

963
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:38,609
I always said about Brett,
he's got two brain cells,

964
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,393
and they're both fighting
for third place.

965
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:42,482
A reasonable man would
have gotten a job.

966
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,876
Yeah.
Well, he's not reasonable.

967
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:47,531
I mean, we knew that he was
never going to get a job.

968
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,750
I don't know why
I told her to talk to him.

969
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,273
Yeah.

970
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:52,405
Well, I'm going to give him
a dose of his own medicine

971
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:53,754
next time I see him.

972
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:56,235
Yeah, not if
I beat you to it.

973
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:57,802
You're going to need
a long reach.

974
00:40:57,803 --> 00:41:00,369
I'm getting on the next
flight to Houston.

975
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,067
I'm coming home, Dad.
