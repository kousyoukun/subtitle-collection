1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,066
Boy, boy, am I ready for lunch.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,366
You're on your way, right?

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,986
Well, I've got an appetite.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,546
The corner house left their
beagle out in the yard again.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,360
I swear, I was running for my life.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,946
What in the heck?

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,206
Hold on, Dad.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,736
Something's spilled in my seat.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,906
It's all wet.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,590
It smells like gasoline.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,006
Call 911!

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,836
Somebody help!

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,690
Call 911!

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,466
Hi, sis.

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,036
If you're calling to try to convince me

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,336
to talk to Dad again,

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,166
it's a lost cause, so let it go.

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,996
It's not why I'm calling.

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,656
I need some advice.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,436
<i>Is everything OK? Are the kids all right?</i>

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,006
No, no, no. The kids are great.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,356
I just

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,900
I just dropped them off at school.

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,886
It's Brett.

25
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,236
OK.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,366
How are his interviews going?

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,886
<i>There was no interview.</i>

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,366
<i>I just found out he's been lying to me</i>

29
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,066
for the last six months
about looking for a job.

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,726
I'm sorry. What?

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,416
All those supposed interviews,

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,506
and he's just been hanging out at bars.

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,776
OK, well, who the hell
is paying his bar tab?

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,556
<i>I'm keeping us afloat.</i>

35
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,386
I'm working overtime at Dad's
shop, doing the accounting.

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,736
But between work and the kids,
I can't do this anymore.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,086
And to find out he's been
lying on top of all this, I...

38
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,916
You're not supposed to be
doing this alone, Tink.

39
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,096
You have a partner who was
supposed to be getting a job.

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,266
I don't blame him. I never did.

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,136
<i>He's had it rough.</i>

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,446
Tink, I'm sorry, OK?

43
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,926
I'm... I'm so sorry that this is happening.

44
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,066
<i>And I know that he hasn't had it easy.</i>

45
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,586
But he still has to take
accountability for this, OK?

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,416
You need to talk
to your husband, all right?

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,156
You need to tell him that you know and

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,596
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

49
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,166
<i>Work is calling, so I need to go.</i>

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,126
But I want you to sit down
and have a come-to-Jesus talk

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,840
with your husband.

52
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,850
Promise?

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,736
OK.

54
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,136
OK, I will.

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,786
Thank you for listening, Nina.

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,046
I love you.

57
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,730
Mean it.

58
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,486
I love you more.

59
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,236
Victim's a postal worker
named Vicky Collins.

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,536
She was halfway through her daily route

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,796
when her truck caught fire.

62
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,276
And she suffered third-degree burns.

63
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,026
She was DOA when I got here.

64
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,636
- Who's our witness?
- A guy named Conrad Wong.

65
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,766
He was over there with his baby
when he saw a Black male,

66
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,206
medium build, put a package wrapped

67
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,686
in duct tape in the truck.

68
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,376
Figured it was just
a neighbor dropping off

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,726
some last-minute mail till
he heard Vicky screaming

70
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,116
and saw the fire.

71
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,296
When he ran to help,
he saw that same Black male

72
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,516
taking off headed that way.

73
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,086
And what's this from?

74
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,176
Part of the blanket Mr. Wong
used to try to save Vicky.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,476
Burned both his hands pretty bad.

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,176
He's at the hospital getting treated now.

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,696
Any other witnesses?

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,380
Not so far.

79
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,966
Going to be hard to find
any usable evidence.

80
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,666
That truck had half a day's
worth of mail in it.

81
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,316
Mr. Wong said it burned up really fast.

82
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,626
That's why we have the ATF

83
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,406
sending out their arson specialists.

84
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,846
Can you check on his status?

85
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,260
Yeah.

86
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,026
Remy, this is the victim's
father, Caleb Collins.

87
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,246
He's a retired firefighter
from Philadelphia.

88
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,247
Special Agent Scott.

89
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,296
Sorry for your loss.

90
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,556
Just tell me what happened.

91
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,256
We think somebody might have planted

92
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,516
an incendiary device in the vehicle.

93
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,086
Is this a case of a crazy person

94
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,696
going after postal workers

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,256
because the letter took too long?

96
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,566
We're looking into it, OK?

97
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,746
We got a full team working on this

98
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,526
FBI, ATF, U.S. postal inspector.

99
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,056
Was Vicky working her
regular route this morning?

100
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,226
Yeah, she was on her way
to pick me up for lunch

101
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,706
like we do every day.

102
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,056
We were on the phone,
talking about where.

103
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,846
When this happened?

104
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,716
Did she say she saw
anyone near her truck?

105
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,106
No.

106
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,116
All she said was her seat was wet

107
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,936
and it smelled like gasoline,

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,036
and then hearing her scream

109
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,280
and not being able to help my little girl.

110
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,956
I want to help.

111
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,306
Well, if you want to help,
you can start by telling us,

112
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,916
had she received any threats recently?

113
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,770
You think this could have been personal?

114
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,316
She was seeing this guy, Anthony

115
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,056
real piece of work.

116
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,666
Is he African American, medium build?

117
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,236
Yeah.

118
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,390
Sir, if you'd come with me,
I'd like to get some more info.

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,636
ATF is 20 minutes out.

120
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,466
Ray is stuck in traffic,
but right behind them.

121
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,596
Hana is looking into an ex-boyfriend

122
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,856
who might be good for this.

123
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,026
Send it to Ray.

124
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,766
Barnes and I will canvass
the neighborhood

125
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,490
while we wait for ATF to show up.

126
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,176
Robert Jimenez?

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,476
Yeah, that's me.

128
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,786
What do we got so far?

129
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,306
The char depth and burn pattern say

130
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,746
the fire originated
right behind the driver's seat.

131
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,926
There's traces of an accelerant as well.

132
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,536
That's right... gasoline.

133
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,966
Our victim was on the phone to
her father when it happened.

134
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,276
She said she smelled it.

135
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,366
A witness saw a guy
dropping off a package

136
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,756
wrapped in duct tape.

137
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,146
Is that what the bomb was in?

138
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,366
Could be.

139
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,456
I found silver fibers under the remnants

140
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,196
of a crude fire starter.

141
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,456
Crude. What do you mean, crude?

142
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,246
The device is on a time delay,

143
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,806
not remotely operated.

144
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,766
He probably stuffed
a shoe box with paper

145
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,426
or some flammable material,
tied a lit cigarette

146
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,076
to a bunch of matches, and dropped it in.

147
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,466
I found the match heads

148
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,596
simple, but lethal.

149
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,036
Matches and cigarettes.

150
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,840
Why does that ring a bell?

151
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,306
You're thinking of John Leonard Orr.

152
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,656
Who's that?

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,086
He was a California fire captain

154
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,746
who set about 2,000 fires.

155
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,486
Same deal... he tied a lit
cigarette to a few matches.

156
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,786
He left a fingerprint

157
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,056
on a piece of paper that didn't burn.

158
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,706
That's how they caught
the son of a bitch.

159
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,016
We're not that lucky.

160
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,446
No prints.

161
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,146
But the match heads were
embedded in something.

162
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,976
Any idea what?

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,196
Water-gel explosive would be my guess.

164
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,626
Something like Tovarc.

165
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,026
It's like dynamite,

166
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,416
except a lot more stable to transport

167
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,846
and safer to handle.

168
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,156
Adding Tovarc to gasoline
and a basic fire starter

169
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,506
your guy wanted to make sure
this fire burned hard and long.

170
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,556
How do you get your hands on Tovarc?

171
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,686
You have to have
a license to purchase it.

172
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,946
But it's not for laymen.

173
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,816
And I bet your arsonist is a layman.

174
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,216
What makes you say that?

175
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,656
You use an explosive
to make things explode, right?

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,176
But Tovarc needs
a secondary charge to go off.

177
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,876
Without that, it burns up
instead of exploding.

178
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,836
You think our fugitive
was looking for a big bang,

179
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,186
and all he got was a big fire.

180
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,276
Any updates,
I want to be the first to know.

181
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,406
Thank you.

182
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,626
Any news on Vicky's ex?

183
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,016
<i>It wasn't him.</i>

184
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,056
He's been at the dentist

185
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,146
getting his wisdom teeth pulled.

186
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,416
He's still there.

187
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,586
OK. So far, we got a Black male fugitive

188
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,066
with access to a water-gel
explosive, maybe Tovarc.

189
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,856
There's a million ways
to make something explode.

190
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,726
This joker has a signature.

191
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,596
I'll check with ViCAP
and BATS for past arsons

192
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,646
involving explosives, see
if they can find me a match.

193
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,736
I want to nail this piece
of garbage to the wall.

194
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,736
You come after one federal employee,

195
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,110
you come after all of us.

196
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,496
William, you back already?

197
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,716
William?

198
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,960
William, that you?

199
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,620
Dang it.

200
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,566
Help me.

201
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,200
I need help!

202
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,250
Help!

203
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,936
Mr. Rayson didn't make it?

204
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,596
Smoke inhalation.

205
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,986
Sorry to hear that.

206
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,296
I tell people all the time,

207
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,906
smoke can be way more
dangerous than fire.

208
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,076
You find anything?

209
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,596
Yeah, we got lucky.

210
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,036
The arsonist left the package
at the kitchen back door.

211
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,646
And this time, it didn't
completely burn up.

212
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,126
Can you confirm that
this is the same arsonist

213
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,826
that hit the postal truck this morning?

214
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,566
Not 100% sure, but there were
more traces of the water gel.

215
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,486
I'll compare it to what
I found on the truck.

216
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,226
Remy, a neighbor walking her dog

217
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,316
noticed a gray Corolla
with a Black male driver

218
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,406
circling the block.

219
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,926
The driver looked lost.

220
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,626
NYPD is canvassing to see if
any cameras picked him up.

221
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,586
Is that a witness?

222
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,170
Victim's son.

223
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,026
Agent Scott and Barnes, FBI.

224
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,026
We're very sorry about your father.

225
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,596
I should have stayed at home today.

226
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,116
I never should have left him alone.

227
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,646
Were you his primary caretaker?

228
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,996
No, he had a nurse
who came four times a week.

229
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,866
I work at a cement plant near here.

230
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,906
Is that where you were today?

231
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,166
No.

232
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,696
It was my day off.

233
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,046
My buddy had an extra pass
to Ridgeland.

234
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,606
That's a golf club for members only.

235
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,356
I jumped at the chance,
but I wish I hadn't.

236
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,576
Did your father know this woman?

237
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,006
I doubt it.

238
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,486
I wished he would have got
out more, made friends.

239
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,626
But with his health issues,

240
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,016
it just made everything so tough on him.

241
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,186
I think he missed his partner.

242
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,536
He had a partner?

243
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,586
No, not that kind of partner.

244
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,846
He was a cop for 30 years
before turning in his badge.

245
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,196
Was he a cop here?

246
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,506
No, Philadelphia.

247
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,506
He was head of the aviation unit.

248
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,156
OK. Thank you, Mr. Rayson.

249
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,620
We appreciate your father's service.

250
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,076
<i>Hey, Remy. What's up?</i>

251
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,126
Our latest victim is a cop
from Philly named Finn Rayson.

252
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,256
And Vicky's dad, Caleb Collins,

253
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,346
was with the Philadelphia
Fire Department.

254
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,956
OK, so Finn is a cop.

255
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,526
And Collins is a firefighter.

256
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,136
They often respond to calls together.

257
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,396
Well, depending on the precinct

258
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,876
and the fire station they were at,

259
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,006
they could have responded
to dozens of calls together.

260
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,406
We need to figure out
what the hell connected them.

261
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,666
According to employee records,

262
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,796
they had an overlap in Philadelphia

263
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,806
between 1984 and 1989.

264
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,910
I'm going to start digging into that.

265
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,636
Looks like our gel substance is Tovarc,

266
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,986
but our arsonist had the foresight

267
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,376
to remove its cartridge.

268
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,986
What does that mean?

269
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,386
We can't track down where
our fugitive purchased it.

270
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,686
But Robert can see if
he can salvage the taggant.

271
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,346
And taggant is?

272
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,956
<i>It's a microscopic fingerprint.</i>

273
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,916
It's a unique physical marker
they put in products

274
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,656
to authenticate them.

275
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
If he can find it, we'll know
where the Tovarc came from.

276
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,726
Why the hell are you following me?

277
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,880
Who are you?

278
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,096
It's pretty brave of you to
confront a stranger like that.

279
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,496
You never know what people
are capable of these days.

280
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,926
That's why I got my gun.

281
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,756
Well, they say, "Don't
bring a knife to a gunfight."

282
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,156
You brought a gun to confront
a potential bomber.

283
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,546
What do you mean?

284
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,856
The guy killed two people using arson.

285
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,936
He uses explosives to start the fires.

286
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,286
We think that he was
driving a gray Corolla

287
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,856
like the one that you reported seeing.

288
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,296
No kidding.

289
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,726
I thought he was some psycho driver

290
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,076
I accidentally cut off on my run.

291
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,816
I got a look at his plates
before he drove off.

292
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,866
RY65C4JXM.

293
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,306
That's a good eye.

294
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,306
We'll run these numbers,
see if we can ID the guy.

295
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,966
Do you, by chance, have any
connection to Philadelphia?

296
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,136
You're kidding, right?

297
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,926
My granddad was Eric Raymond, Sr.

298
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,926
He was the mayor of
Philadelphia in the '80s.

299
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,276
All right. So what about you personally?

300
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,056
From Brooklyn, born and raised.

301
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,976
My folks left Philly as soon as
my grandfather's term was up.

302
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,286
They wanted to get away
from the bad memories.

303
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,326
What bad memories?

304
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,076
He was the Philly mayor in 1985,

305
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,376
when the MOVE bombing happened.

306
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,296
What happened again?

307
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,606
MOVE is a communal Black liberation

308
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,646
and environmentalist organization

309
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,566
founded in the 1970s by a man

310
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,786
who renamed himself John Africa.

311
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,436
Yeah, my dad wasn't
a member of MOVE,

312
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,826
but he liked parts of their cause.

313
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,916
They're a religious,
pro-nature community.

314
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,356
Well, apparently
they rejected modern life

315
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,486
and dependence on technology.

316
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,616
This "Guardian" article says
that they were a mix

317
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,706
of Black power and flower power.

318
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,446
That's what got them
in trouble with the cops.

319
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,056
Yeah, Philly PD and the mayor didn't like

320
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,106
the demonstrations of protest
that they were putting on.

321
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,456
In the late '70s, there were
several violent clashes

322
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,896
between MOVE and the police,

323
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,456
which led to what happened next.

324
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,686
In May, 1985,
Philly PD dropped a C4 bomb

325
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,906
on one of the homes occupied by MOVE.

326
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,476
Police bombed American
citizens on American soil?

327
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,566
I saw the news coverage.

328
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,606
That neighborhood was
totally decimated.

329
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,346
That's a lot of destruction.

330
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,566
I mean, how big was this bomb?

331
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,096
Big enough to clear three city blocks.

332
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,876
There was a gas-powered
generator in one of the homes.

333
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,796
The founder of MOVE was killed

334
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,430
along with five adults and five kids.

335
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,666
That's got to be our connection.

336
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,676
I bet Caleb Collins was
a firefighter at the scene.

337
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,676
And Eric Sr. Was the mayor at the time,

338
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,156
so he signed off on the bombing.

339
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,376
And get this.

340
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,156
Finn Rayson flew the helicopter

341
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,466
that dropped the bomb.

342
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,376
The bomb was a mixture
of C-4 and Tovarc.

343
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,596
Maybe our arsonist is a MOVE member.

344
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,866
Starting these fires could
be his way of retaliating

345
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,996
for the bombing.

346
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,556
I mean, is MOVE still around today?

347
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,436
I can't seem to find much about it online.

348
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,786
They used to have a website,
but it's a broken link now.

349
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,980
But the domain still exists,
so someone's paying for it.

350
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,356
That would be Gretchen Smith.

351
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,666
She's a violin teacher in Manhattan.

352
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,966
All right, it's late.

353
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,080
Let's pack up, go see
Gretchen in the morning.

354
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,716
I thought MOVE was supposed
to be anti-technology.

355
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,976
How does having a website fit into that?

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,726
MOVE was founded before the
personal computer was invented.

357
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,726
- We had to evolve to survive.
- We?

358
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,246
You weren't even born
when MOVE was active.

359
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,856
Same crap, different decade.

360
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,986
We peace-loving folks are still dealing

361
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,076
with police brutality and oppression.

362
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,956
That's why I'm trying
to keep MOVE alive.

363
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,776
What does MOVE look like today?

364
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,346
Some of us meet
informally now and then,

365
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,956
but there's no main group

366
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,526
spearheading events or anything.

367
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,876
Given what happened before, I

368
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,046
I think that's for the best.

369
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,576
You're like everyone else
who wants to make us

370
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,266
go away permanently.

371
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,706
And they tried before.

372
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,276
Let's not forget that the U.S. government

373
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,056
bombed its own citizens
and killed five kids.

374
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,756
We believe a MOVE member might

375
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,366
be trying to avenge that
tragedy by setting these fires.

376
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,886
He's already killed two people.

377
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know anything about that.

378
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,726
We want a list of all MOVE affiliates

379
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,026
you've been in touch with.

380
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,076
As if I'd hand that over without a warrant.

381
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,776
Yeah.

382
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,256
It's the FBI who supplied
the bomb to the Philly PD

383
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,776
in the first place.

384
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,956
And when they dropped the bomb,
the police shot at folks

385
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,256
trying to flee the burning building.

386
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,476
Allegedly.

387
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,477
There are some accounts that say that.

388
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,956
MOVE shot at the cops first.

389
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,396
Allegedly.

390
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,746
Whose side are you on?

391
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,510
The innocent.

392
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,966
How does your dad feel
about MOVE now?

393
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,666
Probably the same way I do.

394
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,796
It's important we don't just gloss over

395
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,846
everything that happened.

396
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,976
History cannot repeat itself.

397
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,326
Hey, Hana. What's up?

398
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,586
I'm sending you a list

399
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,806
of MOVE affiliates in the area.

400
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,286
How'd you get your hands on that?

401
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,326
I tracked the IP address of every device

402
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,986
that visited the MOVE website
when it was still up.

403
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,116
<i>Do any of these people own
a gray Corolla?</i>

404
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,726
Unfortunately, no.

405
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,336
The license plate came back
as stolen from a Honda Accord.

406
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,726
<i>The car is a dead lead.</i>

407
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,516
<i>And there are over 20 names on the list.</i>

408
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,686
Who would you start with?

409
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,216
Ayo Parsons in Queens.

410
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,436
She was one of the original
members of MOVE

411
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,216
and one of the founder's relatives.

412
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,526
<i>She might have insight into our unsub.</i>

413
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,680
Have Ray and Nina head over there now.

414
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,446
So this is Ayo Parsons.

415
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,836
She's formerly known as Ayo Africa.

416
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,836
She was arrested in 1978
for taking part in a riot

417
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,666
that left one police officer dead.

418
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,366
- She's out on parole?
- Yeah.

419
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,666
She was released last year.

420
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,806
She changed her maiden name back

421
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,180
and has been laying low ever since.

422
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,376
You think that's our guy?

423
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,896
I don't know.

424
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,246
Well, what makes you think that's him?

425
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,800
Gut feeling.

426
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,736
Yep, that's him. Hey.

427
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,086
Come here. Hey!

428
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,330
FBI. Come here.

429
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,466
- Hey!
- Hey!

430
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,986
- Move!
- Watch out!

431
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,580
- Hey!
- I'm trying to go!

432
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,566
- Hey!
- What the hell?

433
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,890
- What are you doing?
- Hey, watch it!

434
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,916
Hey, look out! Hey, move!

435
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,086
- Move, move!
- Look out!

436
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,226
Watch out. Watch out.

437
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,396
Hey, stop the car!

438
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,136
Hey, hey!

439
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,820
Get down.

440
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,390
Damn it.

441
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,676
I've been reviewing the security footage

442
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,636
from the café, but I haven't been able

443
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,026
to get a good look at his face.

444
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,196
Well, I did get a good look
in this guy's car.

445
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,116
It was a mess, like he's living out of it.

446
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,766
Yeah. We think he might be homeless.

447
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,906
Depending how long this whack
job has been on the street,

448
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,906
it's going to be tough to ID
him without a home address.

449
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,386
Is that a work shirt?

450
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,930
Can we zoom in on that?

451
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,526
Barco Security.

452
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,696
I've got a Barcolo Security.

453
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,176
It's the same logo.

454
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,186
They provide services
nationwide to businesses

455
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,876
like malls and banks.

456
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,006
I'm going to start looking

457
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,310
through their employee database.

458
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,106
It's Robert from ATF.

459
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,316
All right.

460
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,846
So this guy was
targeting MOVE members.

461
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,236
Safe to say that he's probably
not down for the cause.

462
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,116
What if he was on his way to meet her,

463
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,596
and she's covering for him?

464
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,246
Well, we spoke with Ayo,
and she put MOVE behind her.

465
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,506
Ever since she got out on parole,

466
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,906
she just wants to be with family

467
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,036
and catch up on lost time.

468
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,596
Maybe this guy isn't part of MOVE.

469
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,476
But the threads keep
connecting him to the bombing.

470
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,036
Who else was impacted by this?

471
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,476
Along with 11 MOVE members,

472
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,346
the fire spread to 60 other row houses.

473
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,216
Yeah. 200 people lost their homes.

474
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,346
That makes for a lot
of potential suspects.

475
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,916
OK, so Robert zeroed in on the taggant

476
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,316
from the Rayson crime scene.

477
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,966
It's part of a bulk order purchased by

478
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,096
a construction company
that does road work

479
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,966
up and down the Eastern seaboard.

480
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,626
That gets us closer,
but not close enough.

481
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,586
Can we see if that construction company

482
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,756
used Barcolo for their security?

483
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,066
I'll do you one better.

484
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,846
I think I may have the guy.

485
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,246
Yeah, that's him.

486
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,506
Gerald Colworth of Long Island City.

487
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,336
He was a security guard
up until six months ago,

488
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,946
when he was fired.

489
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,256
He registered a gray
Toyota Corolla with Barcolo

490
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,776
to get a parking pass for work.

491
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,686
But the car was actually
registered to his ex-wife,

492
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,296
Leticia Colworth.

493
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,176
They had two kids together
before they divorced last year.

494
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,916
Let's go talk to the ex.

495
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,306
Get a handle on how this dude
went from married father of two

496
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,826
to homeless arsonist.

497
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,576
I'm going to talk to his boss at Barcolo.

498
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,006
I'll work on finding out
exactly how Colworth is

499
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,486
connected to the MOVE bombing.

500
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,966
I want to know how much
Tovarc this guy's

501
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,576
got in his arsenal.

502
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,146
If he figures out how to make
this bomb blow up right,

503
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,040
we're all in serious trouble.

504
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,976
Gerald worked for you for five years

505
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,766
before you suddenly fired him.

506
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,856
What happened?

507
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,336
It wasn't sudden.

508
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,946
I liked Gerry.

509
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,116
Even when he started coming in
late, I cut him some slack.

510
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,686
I've been divorced.

511
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,646
I know how it rips you open
and tears you up inside.

512
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,346
But a few months later,
he ran out of slack?

513
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,176
Just missed too many shifts.

514
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,566
I couldn't depend on him at all.

515
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,006
Management has me taking shifts now.

516
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,226
I need reliable guys.

517
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,096
I fired Gerry last July.

518
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,136
That's right when he stopped
his mortgage payments.

519
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,406
He lost his house to foreclosure

520
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,536
a couple months later.

521
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,536
That's the wheel of capitalism for you.

522
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,366
It'll grind you into the
dust before it stops.

523
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,546
But, hey, look, I'm sorry about Gerry.

524
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,066
He seemed like a good guy,
a family man.

525
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,856
When he worked here,
did the company report

526
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,726
any thefts from any of your inventory?

527
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,686
We think he might have
stolen some of the explosives

528
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,516
they use here, like Tovarc.

529
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,516
We run inventory every week.

530
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,386
Nothing has been reported stolen

531
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,256
- definitely not Tovarc.
- OK.

532
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,736
Well, triple check that inventory.

533
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,996
And if you come short on
anything, even a tiny amount,

534
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,850
call us right away, OK?

535
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,576
I don't know what I can tell you.

536
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,746
Gerry and I have been
divorced for a year.

537
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,406
Did he ever talk about
the 1985 MOVE bombing?

538
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,666
A little.

539
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,106
I always wished he'd open up more.

540
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,406
It's what broke us up.

541
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,016
Did Gerry and his family
belong to MOVE?

542
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,830
Kids, wait for me.

543
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,416
No, Gerry has nothing to do with that.

544
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,416
But his family lived on that block.

545
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,636
And what happened in 1985,
it destroyed them.

546
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,596
Their house burned down, right?

547
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,036
Yes, but it wasn't about losing the house.

548
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,776
It was about losing his home.

549
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,776
Gerry's parents never recovered.

550
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,436
They had a really ugly split-up.

551
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,526
When we first met, Gerry promised

552
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,396
he'd never let that happen.

553
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,616
He said we'd never, ever get a divorce.

554
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,316
We all get married thinking
it'll never happen to us.

555
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,430
Until it does, right?

556
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,926
I filed for divorce last year,

557
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,106
but I stayed close by for the kids.

558
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,276
Do you guys share custody?

559
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,626
For now.

560
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,626
But since he lost his job
and then the house

561
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,236
if the kids have nowhere
to stay with him,

562
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,716
I might as well move to Phoenix.

563
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,376
My sister lives out there.

564
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,816
It's so much cheaper.

565
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,856
Does Gerry know you want
custody of the kids?

566
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,466
I'm not trying to blindside him.

567
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,646
I told him a few weeks ago.

568
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,816
And how did he react?

569
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,606
Worse than when I told him
I wanted a divorce.

570
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,656
Back then, I had to hide
all the meds in our house.

571
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,006
I was scared he might do something

572
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,306
he couldn't take back.

573
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,640
He already has.

574
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Two people are dead.

575
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,430
What?

576
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,066
Our kids are Gerry's world.

577
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,586
And they adore him back.

578
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,456
When they find out what
he's done, it'll destroy them.

579
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,376
When's the last time
you spoke with him?

580
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,196
A couple weeks ago.

581
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,416
Gerry called me from a number
I didn't recognize.

582
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,530
Let's give it a try.

583
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,946
<i>Brooklyn Men's Emergency Shelter.</i>

584
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,906
<i>Aditi speaking.</i>

585
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,996
Ray and Barnes are
back here on speaker.

586
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,696
Gerry was eight when
they lost their family home.

587
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,956
His family was involved in a lawsuit

588
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,396
against the city of Philadelphia

589
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,746
and the police department.

590
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,616
Since Gerry can't provide a stable home,

591
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,056
his wife is suing him for
full custody of their kids.

592
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,536
That kind of mirrors
what happened to him

593
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,926
when he was little.

594
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,706
Yeah, look, the police bombed
MOVE headquarters.

595
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,316
Gerry loses his childhood home.

596
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,756
Then he loses his family.

597
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,456
So it's happening again
to him 40 years later.

598
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,066
That must be what triggered him.

599
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,586
<i>After his house was foreclosed,</i>

600
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,766
Gerry stayed at a men's shelter.

601
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,246
We just spoke to the director.

602
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,766
Yeah, you think he's going
after the shelter next?

603
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,076
<i>They've been alerted.</i>

604
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,556
Gerry even brought his
kids there and pretended

605
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,076
it was a weekend excursion.

606
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,426
The shelter has a strict no-kids policy,

607
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,686
so they had to ask Gerry to leave.

608
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,686
And he hasn't been back since.

609
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,386
That's harsh.

610
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,436
All right.

611
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,736
So no family, no home.

612
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,476
This guy's got nothing to lose.

613
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,916
Where's he going next?

614
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,566
The shelter director
said that Gerry was friendly

615
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,176
with a guy named Trent
who comes around

616
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,316
for a hot meal, but also keeps a spot

617
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,186
at an encampment in Astoria.

618
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,536
Sending you the cross streets.

619
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,886
Meet us there.

620
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,870
All right.

621
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,587
Hana.

622
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,286
Ethan's calling you.

623
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,830
Here.

624
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,856
You're not going to answer it?

625
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,946
Nope.

626
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,596
We broke up two weeks ago.

627
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,296
Hana, I'm so sorry.

628
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,556
There were signs.

629
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,516
- I missed them.
- What kind of signs?

630
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,476
I don't want to talk about it.

631
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,630
Yeah, of course.

632
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,680
<i>Have you seen this guy?</i>

633
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,956
Have you seen this man?

634
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,616
OK. Thank you.

635
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,786
Nobody recognizes him.

636
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,876
At least that's what they say.

637
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,316
Half of them won't even talk.

638
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,746
They don't trust the badge.

639
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,186
I mean, every major city,
cops are constantly

640
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,756
harassing them,
making them move around,

641
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,236
set up camps in different places.

642
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,716
That's why MOVE didn't trust the cops

643
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,716
the constant harassment.

644
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,236
It's Horus, Gerry's old boss.

645
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,806
All right.

646
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,416
Remy's found Trent.

647
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,416
Great.

648
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,376
How well do you know Gerry?

649
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,986
You know, about as well as

650
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,726
you get to know the guy
who's stuck in the same

651
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,270
sinking boat with you.

652
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,686
It must be pretty hard

653
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,426
to get a decent night's
sleep around here.

654
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,776
Why do you stay?

655
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,426
Yeah, it's just noise, you know.

656
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,606
Better than camping out someplace

657
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,306
quiet and residential.

658
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,006
And you always got
the cops on your ass.

659
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,006
OK, so you're here because
the neighbors don't complain.

660
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,706
Out of sight, out of mind, which is exactly

661
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,836
how the public likes
their homeless, right?

662
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,316
I'm sorry, the unhoused,
as though semantics

663
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,796
are going to put a freaking
roof over our heads.

664
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,066
Is that what you and Gerry talked about?

665
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,156
Yeah, I mean, I'm over it, man.

666
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,976
But Gerry...

667
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,026
He would get all riled up.

668
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,896
He talks about how
the police and politicians,

669
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,776
they don't want to do their
jobs, yada, yada, you know.

670
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,116
You talking about the housing crisis?

671
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,556
I'm talking about any crisis, man.

672
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,866
Not like we elected them to put out

673
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,386
these kind of fires or anything.

674
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,256
Though, if you ask Gerry,

675
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,176
he'd say they wouldn't put out a fire

676
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,436
even if that was exactly their job.

677
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,266
What do you mean by that?

678
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,136
His house burned down
when he was a kid.

679
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,576
He said the firefighters, they showed up.

680
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,226
They just stood around

681
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,950
and watched that baby
burn to the ground.

682
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,716
So that was Gerry's old boss.

683
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,936
He said all of the Tovarc is accounted for.

684
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,896
However, a spool of det cord
went missing in the last day.

685
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,066
They never changed the locks
after Gerry got fired,

686
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,596
so he could have used his key to steal it.

687
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,206
What's det cord?

688
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,636
It's a detonation cord.

689
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,296
Yeah, that's - it's a tiny little tube

690
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,946
filled with explosives.

691
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,426
We used to use that back in Afghan

692
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,736
to blow up expired ordnance.

693
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,086
The arson investigator said that Tovarc

694
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,606
needs a secondary explosive
to be triggered.

695
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,916
Would det cord work?

696
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,916
It's exactly what det cord's for.

697
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,746
Turn a little kaboom into a big kaboom.

698
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,046
No big deal.

699
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,966
That whole blast you heard earlier

700
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,356
I mean, you got those
construction crews.

701
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,730
They're running det cord
and Tovarc every damn day.

702
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,926
OK.

703
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,756
So Gerry could have gotten
the Tovarc from anywhere,

704
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,276
including that construction site.

705
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,366
Yeah, but he didn't know
he needed the det cord

706
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,766
to make it explode.

707
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,456
Until he saw the first
two arsons were fires,

708
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,856
not explosions.

709
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,466
Now that he has these two ingredients,

710
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,140
it's only a matter of time
before the big kaboom.

711
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,906
Gerry told a friend that
when his house burned down,

712
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,036
the fire department just
stood by and did nothing.

713
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,086
Is that true?

714
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,476
You don't understand.

715
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,776
You're asking me about something

716
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,256
that happened 40 years ago.

717
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,656
I don't remember the details.

718
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,136
<i>We're not passing judgment.</i>

719
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,566
We just need to know
what really happened.

720
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,046
It was my second year on the job.

721
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,316
I was following orders.

722
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,056
What were your orders?

723
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,406
<i>To stand down.</i>

724
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,056
No one expected the fire
to get so out of control.

725
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,536
It got out of control

726
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,936
because you didn't do anything to stop it.

727
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,106
It was a mess.

728
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,416
My lieutenant called it a war zone.

729
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,246
<i>And this is the guy that
did two tours in Vietnam.</i>

730
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,806
<i>Bullets were flying.</i>

731
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,076
Who started the shooting?

732
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,596
<i>Depends on who you ask.</i>

733
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,076
Some folks say the cops were
shooting at the MOVE folks

734
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,686
trying to escape the fire.

735
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,606
And the cops say
MOVE fired at them first.

736
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,916
Now, what were we supposed to do?

737
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,436
We couldn't disobey
the fire commissioner.

738
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,266
Is he the one who gave the order?

739
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,396
As far as I know, he was given that order

740
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,770
by the police commissioner.

741
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,056
Is this why my daughter was killed?

742
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,676
Over something I did four decades ago?

743
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,016
No.

744
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,350
It's over what you didn't do.

745
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,286
Gerry went after a firefighter
at the scene

746
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,686
the helicopter pilot
who dropped the bomb,

747
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,986
then the mayor.

748
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,646
He's working his way
up the chain of command.

749
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,206
Contact the fire
and police commissioners.

750
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,516
We got to warn them.

751
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,296
The Philadelphia police
commissioner in 1985

752
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,956
was Victor Kipling.

753
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,346
He lives in a senior community
in New Rochelle.

754
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,176
Fire commissioner is in New York now.

755
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,606
His last known is in Brooklyn.

756
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,956
You and Ray go see
the fire commissioner.

757
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,420
The rest of you, with me.

758
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,496
Damn incident derailed my career.

759
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,106
By incident, you mean
the bomb you ordered

760
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,326
that killed 11 people?

761
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,196
It wasn't just any person.

762
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,326
They were disrupting the city
and endangering the police.

763
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,546
What about the five kids?

764
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,986
How were they endangering the police?

765
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,896
I mean, those five kids weren't
the only collateral damage.

766
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,986
200 homes burnt that day.

767
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,987
This is Gerry Colworth.

768
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:31,256
He lost his childhood home.

769
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,736
Do you recognize him?

770
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,346
No.

771
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,566
But I do remember the Colworth name.

772
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,346
His parents were part
of a lawsuit against the city

773
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,046
and your police department.

774
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,656
That's right.

775
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,526
First time I saw her in court,
Loretta Colworth was pregnant.

776
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,900
They told me she had
a miscarriage later.

777
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,610
Family blamed it on the stress
from losing their house.

778
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,196
Look, we never meant to hurt any kids,

779
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,026
but they shouldn't have been in
that house in the first place.

780
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,296
If I was their parents,
I would never forgive myself

781
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,670
for putting my kids in danger's way.

782
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,736
There's nothing worse

783
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,266
than seeing somebody you love get hurt,

784
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,460
especially if it's your fault.

785
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,496
You know, we've assumed that

786
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,146
Gerry was going after the people

787
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,716
who were responsible for the bombing.

788
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,066
But what if he's actually
going after their loved ones?

789
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,716
Collateral damage.

790
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,936
That's a worse punishment than
going after people themselves.

791
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,766
We thought he was going after the dad,

792
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,676
but maybe he was going
after Vicki all along.

793
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,946
He didn't mix up Eric Junior, by the way.

794
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,686
He was stalking the mayor's
grandson on purpose.

795
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,556
And Finn Rayson's son
was supposed to be home

796
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,020
when Gerry set that fire.

797
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,346
<i>What's up, Ray?</i>

798
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,086
We got a BOLO hit on
Gerald's car in the Bronx.

799
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,126
We're headed there now.

800
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,680
I'll drop you a location pin.

801
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,786
Bring around the Tahoe.

802
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,926
Isn't that where
the fire commissioner lives?

803
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,096
House sitter said he's out of town.

804
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,706
He and his wife are in Florida.

805
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,666
Does he have relatives in the Bronx?

806
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,576
We think Gerry's going
after the family members

807
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,586
of the people responsible
for the bombing.

808
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,886
His car is parked in
a dense residential area.

809
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,546
If we have to account for relatives,

810
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,480
it will take time
to figure out who he's after.

811
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,376
They found our fugitive's
car in the Bronx.

812
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,246
Where in the Bronx?

813
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,320
My granddaughter lives there.

814
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,746
Maya Kipling?

815
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,380
FBI.

816
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,366
Can I help you?

817
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,690
I'm Special Agent Remy Scott.

818
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,326
Is somebody already in there?

819
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,496
We're fine.

820
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,896
It's all we have, Billy.

821
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,506
Let's go upstairs.

822
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,180
Are there kids in there?

823
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,050
We think you might be in danger.

824
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,696
This is my cousin Terry.

825
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,086
She helps me out sometimes.

826
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,346
Helps you out with what?

827
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,656
Are you running
a daycare from your house?

828
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,006
I'm going to get a license.

829
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,176
I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

830
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,306
We're the FBI, not the IRS.

831
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,307
We don't care about that.

832
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:41,916
Are you in trouble?

833
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,056
It's fine.

834
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,536
Go help Angela start quiet hour, OK?

835
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,276
Just let me talk to them.

836
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,106
So what's going on?

837
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,796
A serial arsonist might be
targeting your home.

838
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,846
What?

839
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,066
How many kids do you have here?

840
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,286
We have six today.

841
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,716
Angela and Terry are with them upstairs.

842
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,246
OK. I need you to contact their parents

843
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,636
and have them pick them up now.

844
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,530
- Are you sure?
- Get them out.

845
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,346
Angela?

846
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,566
Angela, bring the kids down. Come on.

847
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,006
Come on. Come on, honey. Yes.

848
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,226
Yeah, come on. Come on.

849
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,526
It's OK. Let's head outside, all right?

850
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,226
We got a fire in here.

851
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,616
- Get them out.
- We're going to head out.

852
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,706
Head out. There's a fire.

853
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,836
Let's go, all right?

854
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,096
Come on, guys, we gotta get out.

855
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,186
Come on, come on.

856
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,536
Keep going down the stairs.

857
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,886
What happened? Whose kids are these?

858
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,586
She runs a daycare in there.
We got to get them out of here.

859
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,587
I got them.

860
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:41,066
- Come on.
- Where's Terry?

861
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,456
- What?
- I don't know.

862
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,726
- I just grabbed the kids.
- OK.

863
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,066
I got her. Go, go.

864
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,156
- Nina.
- I got her.

865
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,206
We got two inside.

866
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,726
One's an FBI agent.

867
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,750
Fire in the back.

868
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,020
He's on the roof!

869
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,646
Hey.

870
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,566
Hey... Terry.

871
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,696
Terry, wake up.

872
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,746
Come on.

873
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,136
Come on.

874
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,046
I'm going to get you out of here.

875
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,070
Get down!

876
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,196
Guys, where is he?

877
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,660
<i>Across the street on the roof.</i>

878
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,596
Cover us.

879
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,190
OK.

880
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:36,947
Stay with me.

881
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:38,426
I'm right here.

882
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,890
Cover your mouth. Cover your mouth.

883
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,020
Guys, we gotta get out of here.

884
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,160
They're firing at us!

885
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,236
You guys go that way. I'll circle around.

886
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,576
Nina, you're clear.

887
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,586
<i>Get out of there.</i>

888
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,886
Come on, come on.

889
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,130
Come on.

890
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,596
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

891
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,506
I got you. I got you.

892
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,270
We need help... medical assistance!

893
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,646
FBI.

894
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,956
You're stuck between a rock
and a hard place, Gerry.

895
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,436
How does it feel?

896
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,216
Like any other day in the life.

897
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,916
We don't want to shoot you, Gerry.

898
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,956
Don't give us a reason to.

899
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,176
Put the gun down.

900
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,356
Enough people have been hurt.

901
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,666
All right? This ain't '85 back in Philly.

902
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,616
They took a lot from you.

903
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,617
Never made things right.

904
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:41,966
They never do.

905
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,496
But you can make things
right for your kids now.

906
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,016
Do you have any idea how it feels

907
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,806
not being able to give them
a home, keep them safe,

908
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,416
keep our family together?

909
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,936
No, but I know four walls
and a roof don't make a home.

910
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,156
Showing up for them does.

911
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,896
I did everything for my family!

912
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,036
That doesn't concern me.

913
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,516
Drop your weapon.

914
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,036
And then what?

915
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,280
I'm drowning, man.

916
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,996
All my life has been
one thing after the other,

917
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,086
like everyone is at the pool party,

918
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,306
and I'm underwater in the deep end.

919
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,290
And by the time anyone thinks of me,

920
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,966
I'll be nothing but an air bubble.

921
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,706
You got our attention.

922
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,536
But you got to think about your kids.

923
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,066
I don't want to have to explain to them

924
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,310
why my partner shot you.

925
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,246
Come on, Gerry.

926
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,076
Break the cycle.

927
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,336
Put the gun down.

928
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,906
Man, I'm not letting you go out like this.

929
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,190
Put the gun down.

930
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,796
Hands behind your head.

931
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,780
Let's go.

932
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,296
Thank you for staying so late.

933
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,297
I appreciate it.

934
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,426
Of course.

935
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,776
Dougie's an easy-going kid.

936
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,476
Yeah, he gets that one from his dad.

937
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,810
- Good night.
- Night.

938
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,056
Hi. How'd it go with Brett?

939
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,756
<i>Marina... Nina, it's me.</i>

940
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,106
- Dad?
<i>- Listen, don't hang up.</i>

941
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,326
No, you do not get
to call me from Tink's phone.

942
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,766
You want to talk?

943
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,376
<i>Have the balls to call me
from your own phone.</i>

944
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,416
Just listen, please.

945
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,466
I'm at the hospital.

946
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,076
<i>Tink and Brett got into it.</i>

947
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,166
And evidently, he knocked
her around quite a bit.

948
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,556
What? What?

949
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,816
What do you mean
he knocked her around?

950
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,996
He hit her?

951
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,476
How bad is it?

952
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,346
Bad enough that even though

953
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,046
she's not going to press charges,

954
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,476
<i>the boys down at the station</i>

955
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,136
<i>are going to keep him locked up</i>

956
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,446
in the drunk tank overnight
for his own safety.

957
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,666
Yeah, because we're really
concerned with his safety.

958
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,666
Come on.

959
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,276
- Hey, can you stay?
- Yeah.

960
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,586
<i>I always said about Brett,
he's got two brain cells,</i>

961
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,366
<i>and they're both fighting for third place.</i>

962
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,456
A reasonable man would
have gotten a job.

963
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,846
Yeah. Well, he's not reasonable.

964
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,506
I mean, we knew that he was
never going to get a job.

965
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,726
I don't know why I told her to talk to him.

966
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,246
Yeah.

967
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,376
Well, I'm going to give him
a dose of his own medicine

968
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,726
next time I see him.

969
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,206
Yeah, not if I beat you to it.

970
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,776
You're going to need a long reach.

971
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,346
I'm getting on the next flight to Houston.

972
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,060
I'm coming home, Dad.
