1
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:09,337
I always knew
she was out there.

2
00:00:09,436 --> 00:00:11,354
Right woman for me.

3
00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:15,736
Knew we'd start a family.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,423
Knew I'd love my kids
more than myself.

5
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:22,423
Never thought I'd get
a second chance to try.

6
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,264
Guys like you and me,

7
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,697
we aren't meant
to have families.

8
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,203
We don't get second chances.

9
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,085
What?

10
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,212
Did I hurt your feelings?

11
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:44,173
Let's just get this
over with.

12
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:57,353
No turning back now.

13
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,364
What a life.

14
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:09,698
To hell with life.

15
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:11,242
I want their cash.

16
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:12,785
You sure it's in there?

17
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,286
I'm sure.

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,205
We grab it and go.

19
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:18,124
And no witnesses, remember?

20
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:25,714
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,258
- Gracie!
- Hey!

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,552
What are you doing?

23
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:31,137
You sold $1/2 million worth

24
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,555
of grain at Hudson Mill
last week.

25
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,098
We want the money.

26
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:35,224
I don't have it.

27
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,103
Scale ticket says
you took home 50% in cash.

28
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:41,397
So I'll ask you again.
Where is it?

29
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:44,150
- What the hell's going on?
- Eric, let me handle this.

30
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:45,734
You want to help
your father out?

31
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:47,069
Tell me where his office is.

32
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:48,737
It's upstairs,
but I'm telling you,

33
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:49,989
there is nothing up there.

34
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:51,240
Show me.

35
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:52,241
- Daddy!
- Come on.

36
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,076
- You too, hero boy.
- Daddy!

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,744
Let's go!

38
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:56,828
Come on!

39
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:03,918
See? No cash.

40
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:05,921
Where is it?

41
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,923
I told you, I don't have it.

42
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,092
No!

43
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,764
See what happens
when you lie to me?

44
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:17,641
Where is he hiding it?

45
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:19,977
I-I don't know! I-I swear!

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,152
- Stop!
- Make her stop crying, okay?

47
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:29,612
It's okay.

48
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:32,198
- You promised me cash.
- It's okay. It's okay.

49
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:34,158
I was told
there was money here.

50
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:35,284
Where is it, bitch?

51
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,452
I don't know! I don't know!

52
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:37,786
Jack handled all of that.

53
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:40,956
Too bad for you, then.

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,791
-Ey!
Come on, she's just a kid.

55
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,960
- I don't care!
You know the rules.

56
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:46,462
Please! Please.

57
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:51,342
I know the password
to the farm's business account.

58
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:53,844
There's at least
$1/2 million in there.

59
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:55,679
I can make a transfer
on my laptop

60
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:58,307
and... and get it from the bank
in the morning.

61
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,476
It... it's right there!

62
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:05,064
Not here. Get the laptop.

63
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:06,815
You're coming with us.

64
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:08,400
Come on!

65
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:11,403
No!

66
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,380
Good news:
My landlord promises

67
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,340
to fix the leak in my apartment
in one week.

68
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,008
Bad news:
In New York real estate time,

69
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:34,092
that's a month minimum.

70
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:37,054
But thanks for letting me
crash here, Hana.

71
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:39,348
- No worries.
Where's all your stuff?

72
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,183
Right here.

73
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,434
You have a washer and dryer,
right?

74
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:44,019
Seriously?

75
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:45,604
You brought your laundry?

76
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:47,773
Yeah. And I brought this.

77
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:49,233
Celebratory shot?

78
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,319
Maybe after work.

79
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:54,613
Who are you?

80
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:58,117
Zadie, meet Crosby,
our new roommate.

81
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,202
Did I miss a house meeting?

82
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:02,371
We're supposed
to discuss these things.

83
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:03,747
It's only temporary.

84
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:06,000
I have a plumbing issue
in my apartment.

85
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:08,795
Welcome.

86
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,172
Don't touch my juice shelf.

87
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:13,508
Okay.

88
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,430
6:00 a.m. this morning,

89
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:21,640
foreman arrives
at Rushing Meadow Farm

90
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:24,059
in Somerset, Pennsylvania,
and finds the front door

91
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:26,228
of the owner's house
broken into.

92
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:29,064
He goes inside to find this.

93
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,150
Victims are Jack Cartwright,
very successful

94
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:34,153
proprietor of the farm,
and his 17-year-old son, Eric.

95
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:35,821
That desk has been ransacked.

96
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:37,406
Could be someone
was looking for money.

97
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,907
And murdered them both
to get it.

98
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:40,743
There's more.

99
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,245
Eric is Jack's son
from his first marriage.

100
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:45,915
Eight years ago,
Jack then remarried Amelia,

101
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,583
a schoolteacher
from New Hampshire.

102
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,251
She adopted Eric,
and then they had

103
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:51,003
a six-year-old daughter
named Gracie.

104
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,130
Both the mom and the daughter
are missing.

105
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:55,007
So it's a home invasion
turned double murder

106
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,175
turned double kidnapping?

107
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,384
Correct.

108
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,261
And this is who
we're looking for:

109
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,764
Samuel Rutledge, 38 years old,

110
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:04,433
recently paroled
after serving nine years

111
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:06,143
on an aggravated assault charge

112
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:08,270
at the State Prison for Men
in Concord.

113
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,773
Somerset PD
found his ankle bracelet

114
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:12,274
with the strap cut in two

115
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,817
five miles
from the Cartwrights' driveway.

116
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:16,111
Then about an hour ago,
surveillance cam

117
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:18,822
at a gas station in Nashua
caught this.

118
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:20,449
That's Sam
in the passenger seat.

119
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,825
Who's his partner?

120
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,327
That's the owner of that van,

121
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:26,288
another ex-con on parole
named Peter Timmons.

122
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,916
He did five years
at Greensboro Correctional

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,959
in Manchester on a drug charge.

124
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:32,461
Wait, they weren't
in prison together?

125
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:33,504
No.

126
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:36,674
All we know is,
they were in New Hampshire,

127
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:39,134
they drove 492 miles
through five states

128
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,011
to commit these crimes,

129
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:42,346
and now they're
on their way back.

130
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,306
So why target this family?

131
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,476
Why kill the two men,
take the mom and daughter?

132
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,144
Maybe they didn't get
what they wanted.

133
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,480
Amelia and Gracie
could be collateral.

134
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,649
They could also be
human shields.

135
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:54,817
Amber alert go out?

136
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,653
Yes, and a BOLO on the van.

137
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,988
Okay, I found
their connection.

138
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:01,824
The monitor
on that ankle bracelet

139
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,410
traces to a parole officer
named Barry Sands.

140
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,161
According to
the New Hampshire DOC,

141
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:07,579
he was supervising
the both of them.

142
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,498
Excellent.
Where is Sands' location?

143
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,542
Concord,
same as Peter's last known.

144
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,419
I'm not seeing anything
for Sam.

145
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,670
Okay, let's split up.

146
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,445
Barnes and I will talk
to the parole officer.

147
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,256
Crosby, check out
Peter's apartment.

148
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:19,675
Hana, follow up with Forensics.

149
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,374
Make sure they're
processing the scene

150
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,428
for touch DNA.

151
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,846
Amelia and Gracie
are only useful

152
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,181
to these two until they're not.

153
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,684
Soon as that happens,
they're both dead.

154
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:31,687
Tampering with a GPS monitor
is a felony in this state.

155
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,732
Sam's looking at
another three years in lockup.

156
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:37,067
Well, I'm guessing that's
the least of his worries,

157
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,236
given the murders
and the double abduction.

158
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,863
You sure Peter was with him?

159
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:42,406
Yes.

160
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,033
Didn't know they were pals.

161
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,537
Were their appointments
at the same time each week?

162
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,038
Yeah, every Tuesday.

163
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,041
Sam at 4:00, Peter at 4:30.

164
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,419
Our fugitives met
in your waiting room.

165
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,713
Sam is what we call an NH,

166
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,214
"not human."

167
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:01,091
If the system writes you off
as a monster,

168
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,051
why bother acting
like anything else?

169
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:04,219
And Peter?

170
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:05,390
Never violent,

171
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,930
not even when his wife
served him

172
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,346
divorce papers in prison.

173
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,538
He has an ex-wife?

174
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:10,684
Linda Carroll.

175
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:12,895
Remarried some wealthy
real estate guy.

176
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,730
But Peter found religion
in prison.

177
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:16,232
He forgave her.

178
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,902
Wanted to start a new family,
a new life on the up-and-up.

179
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,904
So if Peter
wanted a second chance,

180
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,740
why would he risk everything
to help Sam?

181
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,826
Love, sex, money, or sport.

182
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,578
We don't have an address
for Sam.

183
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,914
He's only been out six weeks.

184
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,917
Been staying at the Bravo Motel
off of 393.

185
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,419
Popular place for my clientele.

186
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,089
Just spoke to the manager.

187
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:43,091
Sam paid for a week
in the room on Monday,

188
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:44,593
and she hasn't seen him since.

189
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,512
There's toiletries
in the bathroom

190
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:48,430
and shirts hanging
in the closet.

191
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,517
My guess is, he's planning
on coming back.

192
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:56,605
Aha.

193
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:58,107
What do we got here?

194
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,485
Designer bag.

195
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,072
Three-carat princess cut.

196
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:07,491
About 800 bucks
of Italian leather on her feet.

197
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:09,410
This woman is not hurting
for cash.

198
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:12,371
These aren't candid photos.

199
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,706
Another rich lady
and her kid.

200
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,999
Send them to Hana.

201
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,835
Have her run face recognition.

202
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
I'm gonna check in with Crosby.

203
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,287
- Yo.
- Hey.

204
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:28,467
What'd you find
at Peter's apartment?

205
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,347
Nothing here says this guy
knew the victims

206
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,015
or why he was targeting them.

207
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,141
You got anything?

208
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,560
Yeah, we found some photos

209
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,645
in Sam's motel room,

210
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,146
surveillance pictures.

211
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,357
Whoever this woman is,

212
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:40,632
they're definitely
stalking her.

213
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:41,716
Let me see.

214
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,159
Check this out.

215
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,584
That's her.

216
00:08:58,668 --> 00:08:59,960
That's definitely
the same woman.

217
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:01,753
Sure looks like it.
Who is she?

218
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:04,715
Linda Carroll,
Peter's ex-wife.

219
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,009
That's why they're coming back
to Concord.

220
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,594
She's their next target.

221
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,014
What's he doing?

222
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,099
Shh. It's gonna be okay.

223
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,522
You make the transfer?

224
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,524
Yes, but it's gonna take
a couple of hours

225
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,276
to go through.

226
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,028
- Not acceptable!
- Please!

227
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:27,696
You never said
it would take two hours.

228
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,031
It's not my fault.

229
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,033
Hey, Sam,
it's just a minor delay.

230
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,534
Hey, listen, listen.

231
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:34,369
We hit Linda's place
like we planned,

232
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:36,038
take care of this after.

233
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,415
It's a lot of money.
It's worth the wait.

234
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,044
Get in the truck.

235
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,379
Where are you taking us?

236
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,381
Just shut your damn mouth
and get in the truck.

237
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:48,383
Get in!

238
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:51,386
Move.

239
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,898
Where'd you steal the truck?

240
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,900
- Doesn't matter.
Just hurry up.

241
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:42,145
There must be some mistake.

242
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:44,773
Peter's never been violent.

243
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,567
Well, people do change
in prison.

244
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:50,153
So you're saying that
he murdered a teenage boy

245
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:51,614
and his father too?

246
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,158
Uh...

247
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:57,244
Right now, our priority
is to find the woman

248
00:10:57,328 --> 00:10:58,996
and the child that he abducted

249
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,790
before it's too late.

250
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:08,130
Are you aware that anybody

251
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:10,215
might've been
following you recently?

252
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,343
No. Why?

253
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,513
Well, we think
that you and your family

254
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:20,517
might be Peter and Sam's
next target.

255
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,019
Oh, my God.

256
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,897
I'll post officers
outside your house

257
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,942
to protect you, okay?

258
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,737
Have you seen Peter
since he got out of prison?

259
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:35,032
No, but we kept
in regular correspondence

260
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,783
after our divorce.

261
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:41,371
Yeah, his parole officer
said he forgave you?

262
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:42,873
He did.

263
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:44,916
He wanted me to move on.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,334
He wrote me and my husband

265
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:48,378
a lovely poem
on our wedding day

266
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:51,048
and one for Henry at his birth.

267
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,843
If you don't mind,
I'd like to see those.

268
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:16,073
You know, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

269
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,995
I testified
at Peter's parole hearing.

270
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,538
I told the parole board

271
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:27,125
that Peter would never
hurt anyone, and... and now...

272
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:32,214
This is my fault.

273
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,716
No. This isn't your fault.

274
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,552
This is the fault
of two violent men,

275
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:40,013
one that convinced you
they'd been reformed.

276
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,935
It's not a bad thing
to see the good in people.

277
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,569
Some people
call this neighborhood

278
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:55,904
the American Dream.

279
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,948
I call it the American Lie.

280
00:12:58,032 --> 00:13:00,283
I have to go to the bathroom.

281
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,785
Hold it!

282
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:03,245
But I really have to go.

283
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:04,913
Shh, honey. It'll be okay.

284
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,957
I don't like having baggage.

285
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,292
We just stick to the plan,
okay?

286
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:10,585
We're almost there.

287
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,798
- Get on the floor.
- What for?

288
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:16,280
Just do it!

289
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:27,602
Stop.

290
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,484
Well, Pete,

291
00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:36,778
this here is what we call
strike two.

292
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,321
I don't understand.
How did they...

293
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:39,514
It doesn't matter.

294
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:41,658
Just back up and turn around

295
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,952
nice and slow
before they see us.

296
00:13:57,758 --> 00:14:01,678
I'm beginning to think
you're just like them:

297
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:04,347
More of a liability
than you are an asset.

298
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,143
And you know what I do
with liabilities.

299
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:16,860
Nobody called us
about any ransom

300
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:19,321
for Amelia or Gracie,
and if they did...

301
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,989
We'd have found a way
to pay it.

302
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,742
Did Jack or Amelia
mention seeing anyone

303
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:26,370
or anything out of the ordinary
these last few days?

304
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,584
You don't talk
to your daughter much?

305
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:38,215
Amelia was
a challenging child.

306
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,176
I used to call her
my little porcupine.

307
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,553
- She was a beautiful girl.
- Yes.

308
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,680
People were constantly
telling her that.

309
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:48,253
Then at a certain age,
the boys came swarming.

310
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,372
Amelia could've had them
wrapped around her finger

311
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,520
if she wasn't so wrapped up
in her books.

312
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:54,259
She's a smart girl.

313
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:56,233
She was only six years old,
and she said to me,

314
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:59,194
"Mommy, I'm perfectly capable
of making my own dinner."

315
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:00,278
So I let her.

316
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,906
Self-sufficient
for a first grader.

317
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,742
But a common trait
in the children of alcoholics.

318
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:10,872
How long has it been

319
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,666
since you put down the bottle?

320
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,591
I-I can't count
how many times

321
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,760
I drove my daughter
to school drunk

322
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:25,762
or dislocated her shoulder

323
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:26,930
or twisted her arm.

324
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:28,765
I'm not proud of that.

325
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:30,433
You were sick, honey.

326
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,769
Amelia asked me
to quit drinking

327
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,896
the summer she turned 16.

328
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,898
Said if I loved her, I'd do it.

329
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,402
But you didn't.

330
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:45,073
I couldn't do it,

331
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:47,034
even for my own little girl.

332
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,120
Not that summer, anyway.

333
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:54,791
We had rented a house
on Lake Eden in Vermont.

334
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,584
And then there was
the accident.

335
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,086
What accident?

336
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,338
Amelia's friend,
the Collins boy,

337
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:03,925
he was horsing around
on a bridge, took a bad fall.

338
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:05,677
She saw the whole thing.

339
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:08,430
Amelia was never the same
after that.

340
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:10,640
She suffered from depression.

341
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:13,351
Even after she married Jack
and adopted Eric,

342
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:15,103
never got any better...

343
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,605
until they had Gracie.

344
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,149
Motherhood changed her?

345
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,609
Amelia became
joy personified.

346
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,778
She said to me, "Mama,
I've got a second chance.

347
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,822
I feel like I've been reborn."

348
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,199
But then Amelia being Amelia...

349
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:31,661
What happened?

350
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:38,543
They moved to Pennsylvania
after Gracie was born.

351
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:41,171
We haven't seen her
for five years...

352
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:42,839
Or our granddaughter.

353
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:48,303
His name is David Collins.

354
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,764
He dived off a bridge,
hit the water wrong,

355
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:52,057
broke both his shoulders.

356
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,475
It must've been awful.

357
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,864
And Amelia saw
the whole thing?

358
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:56,811
Yes, that, coupled with
her alcoholic father,

359
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:58,313
sent her into a spiral.

360
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,648
She hasn't spoken
to her family for years,

361
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,859
even after she got married
and Gracie was born.

362
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:06,529
Well, the granddaughter
was a chance at reconciliation,

363
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:09,366
yet she still chose
to stay away from her parents.

364
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,534
You think
they're involved somehow?

365
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,536
They don't seem right for that.

366
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,205
Nothing is right
about this case.

367
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,333
Peter Timmons
is a nonviolent pacifist

368
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,377
who murdered two people,
then targeted his ex-wife

369
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,212
after an amicable divorce.

370
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,089
There's no connection
to Amelia,

371
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:28,760
so the only motive
I can think of is... money.

372
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:31,721
I just got off the phone
with the DNA unit at Quantico.

373
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:34,099
They ran touch DNA
on Amelia's dead husband

374
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,850
and Gracie's blankie
they found at the house.

375
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:37,185
Not a match.

376
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:41,272
So Jack isn't
the biological father?

377
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:43,358
- No.
- Then who is?

378
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,193
If I upload
Gracie's DNA profile,

379
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:46,778
we can start with CODIS.

380
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:49,114
I mean, it's a long shot,
but it's a start.

381
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,204
Wow.

382
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:57,872
You get a match?

383
00:17:57,956 --> 00:17:59,082
Yeah.

384
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,502
He's in the system
because we know him.

385
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,922
Gracie's father
is Peter Timmons.

386
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:09,593
This isn't a kidnapping.

387
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:12,720
This is a family on the run.

388
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:20,019
Peter Timmons was one
of my only inmates

389
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:22,897
not to engage in physical
or verbal conflict.

390
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,566
You have mostly
violent criminals here?

391
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,734
Yes.

392
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,569
Even the drug offenders,
ones like Peter,

393
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,571
usually have to turn violent
to survive.

394
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,072
But he stayed above the fray?

395
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,657
Focused on his future.

396
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:34,659
We'd like to see a log
of Peter's visitors

397
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:35,660
during his time here.

398
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:36,924
Anyone in particular?

399
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,455
Amelia Cartwright?

400
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,332
You know her?

401
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,324
Yeah,
Amelia wasn't a visitor.

402
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:45,005
She was our
creative writing teacher,

403
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,421
and Peter was in her class...

404
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,590
Twice a week for three years.

405
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:50,175
That's a lot of time
to spend together

406
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:51,509
without supervision.

407
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:53,428
Yeah, well,
Peter wasn't violent.

408
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,597
And if he wanted to be a lover
and not a fighter,

409
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,098
fine by me.

410
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:59,809
He fathered Amelia's child
during his time here,

411
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,519
the same child
they took on the run

412
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,188
with a violent criminal.

413
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,940
I just thought
he liked poetry.

414
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:08,193
Was there a specific computer
that Peter used

415
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:09,777
when he was in Amelia's
writing class?

416
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,447
Yeah, in the lab.
This way. -

417
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,117
Which one did Peter use?

418
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:18,119
Second one in the back,
always.

419
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:19,454
Listen up, everyone.

420
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:21,623
Save your work,
and let's clear out.

421
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,128
My grandmother
had this computer

422
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:29,130
in, like, 1986.

423
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:31,007
Here,
the warden gave us

424
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:33,886
Peter's prison email
and password.

425
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:41,976
Long-winded op-eds
to local papers,

426
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,853
flowery messages
to his ex-wife.

427
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:45,647
"I once thought
you and I were joined

428
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:47,398
"like the roots
of an ancient oak.

429
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,025
"I know what we had
was fleeting.

430
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,587
We were two leaves
on a single branch."

431
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,237
That's the same poetic tone

432
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,573
as the letters
Linda Carroll gave us.

433
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:59,160
But nothing
to or from Amelia.

434
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:01,913
Unless they were never sent.

435
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,675
What do you mean?

436
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,171
It's a trick terrorists
abandoned circa 2010.

437
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:11,863
You write an email
in the drafts folder.

438
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:14,092
You give someone
your username and log-in.

439
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:17,929
They log in, read and respond,
but the email never gets sent.

440
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:21,516
And prison staff can't monitor
their correspondence.

441
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,017
But we can.

442
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,272
Peter, Amelia. Amelia, Peter.
How long's this going for?

443
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,439
Years.

444
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:41,578
- Sam.
- What are you doing?

445
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:42,827
- Hey.
- Mom!

446
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:44,000
- Where are you taking me?
- No!

447
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,206
Sam, wait!

448
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,749
Mama!

449
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,586
Where are they taking Mommy?

450
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,587
Did you make the transfer?

451
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:51,796
I'm trying. I'm trying.

452
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,256
It's trying now.

453
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,383
It's okay, Gracie.

454
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,969
I won't let anything happen
to your mom...

455
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,387
or you.

456
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:01,723
It's... it's... it's...

457
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,144
Please, please,
please, please, please.

458
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,226
- Sam!
- Please don't. Please don't.

459
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,561
Gracie, stay here.

460
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,646
- Please, please don't.
- Wait! Wait!

461
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,565
- Please.
- Hey.

462
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:11,837
Stay out of it.

463
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:16,571
She said she made the transfer,
but it didn't go through.

464
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,072
No, it says
it's still pending.

465
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:19,490
Look, it is a lot of money.

466
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,075
It takes time
for it to go through.

467
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,744
Which you knew.

468
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:24,245
It's too late now.

469
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:25,913
First thing this morning
would've worked,

470
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,415
but now you're a missing person

471
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,917
with your face plastered
all over New England.

472
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:33,421
You walk into that bank,
it puts us both into jail.

473
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:34,922
You can't just shoot her.

474
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:36,090
Her kid's watching.

475
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,592
And she'll be next.

476
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,094
Sam, this is a mistake.

477
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:42,263
What is it with you
and these ladies, huh?

478
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:44,766
You got a thing
for bitches like her?

479
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,227
Or is it kids
that are your thing?

480
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:50,104
There's a little girl in there.

481
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:53,483
She's pure, untouched,

482
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:55,109
nice looks like her mama.

483
00:21:58,196 --> 00:21:59,656
I can fix this.

484
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,618
I don't have to be the one
to go into the bank.

485
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,119
My father will.

486
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:06,538
Your father.

487
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,249
He lives in Concord.

488
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,001
Take me to his house.

489
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:13,378
I'll transfer him the money,

490
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,129
and he'll go in and pick it up.

491
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:16,631
And bring the cops back
with him.

492
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:17,799
No, he won't.

493
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:20,468
He won't,
not if I tell him not to.

494
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:22,970
Please. Please.

495
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:24,812
It is enough
for any new beginning you want,

496
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:27,600
and I will give you every penny

497
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:30,311
if you just let me
and my daughter go.

498
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,146
Please.

499
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,314
Please, I'm begging you.

500
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:37,694
From Peter to Amelia:

501
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:38,986
"Before I met you,

502
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,155
"I could not fathom
sharing my soul.

503
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,825
"Now I know I must,
for your soul is its mate,

504
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,326
and they must become one."

505
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,203
I hope she gave him
a D on that.

506
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:49,330
From Amelia back to Peter:

507
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,165
"The only thing
that gets me through the week

508
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:52,375
"is knowing I'll see you.

509
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,002
You are my everything.
I love you."

510
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:56,671
That actually sounds sincere.

511
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:57,839
It is sincere.

512
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:59,127
Amelia was vulnerable
and depressed,

513
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,341
and Peter was taking advantage.

514
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:02,844
Writing her letters,
reeling her in.

515
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:04,512
Have you seen
my lens cleaner?

516
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,180
But Peter is the one
in prison.

517
00:23:06,264 --> 00:23:07,849
How does that give him
the upper hand?

518
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,351
Well, it could be
hybristophilia.

519
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,186
Finding stimulation
in your partner's crimes?

520
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,440
Amelia was attracted to Peter
because he was in prison.

521
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,691
Bad-boy syndrome.

522
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,067
It's why a lot
of serial killers

523
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:19,528
get married in prison.

524
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:22,989
Problem is,
Peter's never been violent.

525
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:24,658
Neither have you.

526
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:27,410
I'm just saying,
there's plenty of ways

527
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,788
to control people
if you're smart.

528
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,582
Right.

529
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,045
Maybe that's what
Peter was doing.

530
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,256
He knew Amelia was unhappy
in her marriage.

531
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:41,606
Then they got pregnant.

532
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:43,696
When he gets out,
he can use that as leverage

533
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:45,063
to go after
her husband's money.

534
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:46,562
By getting rid of him?

535
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:51,392
But Peter's not a killer.

536
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:52,935
Maybe that's where
Sam comes in.

537
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,562
He's the muscle,
in it for the money.

538
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:56,439
I might have an answer
on that.

539
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:57,607
What you got?

540
00:23:57,691 --> 00:24:00,067
Six months ago,
Peter told Amelia

541
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:01,402
about some cash
he had hidden away

542
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:02,987
from his drug-dealing days.

543
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:06,073
She asked where, and he said
that he would tell her

544
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:08,242
if she'd come up
with some of her own.

545
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:09,911
Nest egg for Gracie?

546
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:11,579
Doesn't say,
but Amelia replied

547
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:13,122
that Jack probably
wouldn't notice

548
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,249
if she skimmed some money
off the accounts.

549
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,627
Two weeks later,
Peter replied with this.

550
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,592
What are these,
bank accounts?

551
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,093
I don't think so.

552
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:28,596
They look more
like GPS coordinates.

553
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,097
Could be a traditional
geocache,

554
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:32,934
no fancy word problems
or riddles attached.

555
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:37,981
That's the waypoint.

556
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:41,442
It's a forest
in upstate New Hampshire.

557
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:43,611
Where they could be headed
with Gracie.

558
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:46,113
You and Kenny go check it out.

559
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:47,448
You think Sam
knows about this?

560
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:48,783
I have no idea.

561
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,077
He may not even know
Peter is Gracie's father,

562
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,620
but once he finds out,

563
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,872
this whole thing
might get a lot worse.

564
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,626
No one's home.

565
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,044
They're in there.

566
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:02,630
You know, probably watching TV
in the basement.

567
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:03,798
Come on, sweetie.

568
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:04,841
No!

569
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:05,967
She stays here.

570
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:08,469
But my dad
will want to see her.

571
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:10,137
Not an option.

572
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:11,472
And if you try to run...

573
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:13,474
I would never
leave my daughter.

574
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:15,435
Then we won't have a problem.

575
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,896
It's okay.

576
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,190
Go with her.

577
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:22,817
They try to call the cops,
you know what to do.

578
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:25,486
Use the back door,
not the front.

579
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,124
Hey. What the hell?

580
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:41,168
Amelia, you're bringing
your parents into this?

581
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:42,628
Don't be an idiot.

582
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:44,255
This isn't their house.

583
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,882
Then what are we doing here?

584
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:48,175
You just promised Sam
$500,000 in cash!

585
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:50,219
Which he's never gonna get.

586
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:52,847
The plan's changed, Peter.

587
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:55,816
It started when we didn't get
Linda's money.

588
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,843
Yeah, I didn't know the cops
were gonna be there.

589
00:25:57,943 --> 00:25:58,793
Obviously.

590
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:01,457
And I didn't know Sam
was such a loose cannon.

591
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:05,469
So we keep improvising.

592
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:08,834
And now we don't
have to pay him his share.

593
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:10,543
O-okay, great, yeah.

594
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:12,295
So let's not
give Sam his money,

595
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,535
but let's leave him in the car
with our daughter?

596
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,537
Who doesn't even know
I'm her father.

597
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,205
We're gonna tell her.

598
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:19,540
When?

599
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,876
When I say so. That's when.

600
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:33,888
You just need to trust me.

601
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:38,225
Right now,
we've got a bigger problem.

602
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,061
What are you talking about?

603
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,063
You know.

604
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:46,400
I've never
killed anyone before.

605
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:49,403
And you've never loved anyone
like me before.

606
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:56,285
So...

607
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:57,787
if you really love me...

608
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,122
I do.

609
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:02,458
Prove it.

610
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,929
Where is she?

611
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,598
I want my mommy!

612
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:19,934
Hey! Shut up and sit down!

613
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,133
Oh, my God.

614
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:56,637
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

615
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,692
Liabilities and assets.

616
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:11,652
You said it yourself.

617
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,325
Neighbor heard the gunshot

618
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,372
and ran to her window,

619
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,457
managed to get a photo
of a Ford pickup

620
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:26,418
fleeing the scene.

621
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:27,378
You run the plates on that?

622
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,091
Yeah, belongs to a family
in Webster.

623
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:31,349
They said it's their kid's car.
He's off at college.

624
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:32,635
They didn't even know
it was missing.

625
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:33,845
Let's update the BOLO.

626
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,176
DOA's over here.
Let's make a hole, people.

627
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,304
Prints on the ax handle
matched to Peter Timmons,

628
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:39,597
hence our phone call.

629
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:41,348
NO wallet or ID on the victim,

630
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:43,017
but I'm guessing you know him.

631
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:48,856
Your other fugitive, right?

632
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,192
Yeah, Sam Rutledge.

633
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,198
Gutted with an ax
and then shot in the chest.

634
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,033
I guess we
underestimated Peter.

635
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:02,953
Did the witness say
they saw a woman and a child?

636
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:05,873
Your missing persons?
I hadn't gotten there yet.

637
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:08,250
I was still interviewing her
when you rolled up.

638
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:09,961
I'll go talk to her.

639
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,428
Hana, what's up?

640
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:19,512
We followed
those GPS coordinates

641
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,139
to the nest egg.

642
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:23,171
It's some kind
of steamer trunk.

643
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:24,994
It was already dug up
when we got here.

644
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:26,727
- Anything in it?
- Empty.

645
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:28,639
But there's tire tracks
everywhere.

646
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:31,232
Crosby's off checking them out.
Somebody beat us here.

647
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,318
Jess?

648
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:38,072
Probably Peter and Amelia.

649
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:40,825
They killed Sam,
ditched the van,

650
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,494
and took off
in a stolen Ford pickup.

651
00:29:43,578 --> 00:29:44,745
Can't have gotten far.

652
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,831
We should get ERT down here.

653
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,083
They can see if these tracks
match that Ford.

654
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,001
They can also test this trunk.

655
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:53,546
It was buried pretty deep,
but it's probably full of DNA.

656
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,339
Okay. Run it and see.

657
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,766
Tech said he's done
with the steamer trunk.

658
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,228
- Did he send the report?
- Yep. Got it.

659
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:13,691
"Trace elements consistent
with U.S. currency."

660
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:15,109
So there was cash in there.

661
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:17,194
Who got to it first,
Peter or Amelia?

662
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:18,028
Neither.

663
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,615
DNA found
belongs to David Collins.

664
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:22,867
Amelia's friend,

665
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,869
the one from the accident
on the bridge?

666
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:27,079
That's weird.
Does he have a record?

667
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:28,289
He's a coach
at a private school

668
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,040
that requires DNA and prints.

669
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:32,042
Why would Amelia
give him the coordinates

670
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:33,878
to the nest egg
she shared with Peter?

671
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,880
She could have gotten it
anytime by herself.

672
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:40,051
Can you pass me the letters
that Peter sent to his ex-wife?

673
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:42,387
Thank you.

674
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:47,141
"My days here
are filled with noise.

675
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:49,727
"Bars clanging.
Slop hitting trays.

676
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:51,562
"Men's fists on flesh.

677
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:53,439
"But all I hear
is the deafening silence

678
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:55,191
of having disappointed you."

679
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:56,859
That's a far cry
from the prison poetry

680
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:58,652
he sent Amelia.

681
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:04,867
Peter didn't write these.
Amelia did.

682
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,660
She was setting up the ex-wife,

683
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,495
making her think Peter
had forgiven her.

684
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,998
That way,
she's an easier target.

685
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:13,167
You're saying
Peter's not leading this?

686
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:15,002
He might've killed Sam,

687
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,242
but Amelia's calling the shots.

688
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:17,546
This was never about the money.

689
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,341
This is about Amelia's need
to control the men in her life.

690
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:21,717
We have an address
for David?

691
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:24,762
Residence in Tilton
owned by Mary Collins.

692
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:26,597
Looks like he lives
with his sister.

693
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:31,185
Mary Collins?

694
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,519
I'm Agent LaCroix of the FBI.

695
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:33,687
Did you find my brother?

696
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:35,356
David?
We thought he lived here.

697
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,899
He does,
but he's disappeared.

698
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:38,192
He went to work this morning,

699
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:39,902
but the school said
he never showed.

700
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,779
I've been calling his cell
for an hour,

701
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:43,572
and he's not answering.

702
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:44,907
What's going on?

703
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,830
We're looking for a woman
who's been abducted.

704
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,578
We think your brother
might be involved.

705
00:31:49,662 --> 00:31:51,289
Amelia Cartwright?

706
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:54,625
That Amelia?

707
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:55,876
No way.

708
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,211
David would never hurt her.

709
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:59,046
He's been in love with her
his whole life,

710
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,881
even after what she did to him.

711
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:02,326
The accident on the bridge?

712
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,620
It was no accident.

713
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:05,827
We were at our house out
on Lake Eden for the summer.

714
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:06,911
I was there.

715
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:08,060
And what happened?

716
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:09,779
Amelia was egging him on.

717
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:12,059
She told David if he loved her,

718
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:13,936
he'd prove it and jump.

719
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,188
- She push him?
- She didn't have to.

720
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:19,066
My brother was so obsessed
with impressing her,

721
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,776
he decided to dive.

722
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,736
Ripped both his shoulders apart

723
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,364
and ruined his football career,

724
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:27,200
all because of Amelia.

725
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:30,786
Maybe he's finally looking
for payback.

726
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,830
You don't understand.

727
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:35,291
Amelia has this power over men.

728
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,418
It's like,
the worse she treats them,

729
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:38,961
the more they like her.

730
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:42,840
I'm sorry she's missing,
but David wouldn't take her.

731
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:45,510
He's probably out
looking for her himself.

732
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:49,055
All right.
Well, thank you.

733
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:51,890
Oh, whatever happened

734
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:53,475
to your family house
on the lake?

735
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:56,103
We still own it. Why?

736
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,439
Just curious. Thanks.

737
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,028
To fresh starts.

738
00:33:06,948 --> 00:33:09,533
How do we start fresh
without money?

739
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,703
Don't worry.

740
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:15,289
I got this covered.

741
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:18,625
Hey, Mom,
come and check this out.

742
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,127
Oh, what is it?

743
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:21,462
What you got?

744
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,381
I'm making a house
for the animals.

745
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:26,050
How fun.

746
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:28,135
Yeah?

747
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:29,970
Little campfire?

748
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:31,972
So good.

749
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:34,224
- Having fun, right?
- Mm-hmm.

750
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:35,267
Mm.

751
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:36,226
Gracie.

752
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:40,481
There's something
your mother and I

753
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:41,732
wanna tell you.

754
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:42,983
Not now.

755
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:48,322
Take Gracie inside.

756
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,407
I'll take care of this.

757
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:53,577
Relax, Papa Bear.

758
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:57,206
Everything we need
to start a new life

759
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,416
is in that car.

760
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:06,256
Who is he?

761
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,300
An old friend.

762
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:11,428
This is his place.

763
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:12,930
Hi!

764
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,856
49 Meadow Lane,
Eden, Vermont.

765
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,233
On our way now.

766
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:26,151
All right.

767
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:28,612
Why would Amelia go back
to the scene of the accident?

768
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,949
Her brand of psychopathy

769
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:33,534
requires reinvention
to survive,

770
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:36,703
and reinvention requires
cutting all ties to the past.

771
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:38,372
Isn't going back
to the lake house

772
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,665
the opposite of that?

773
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,871
Not if she's returning
to cleanse her original sin.

774
00:34:43,377 --> 00:34:45,879
First she took care
of the husband and the stepson.

775
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:48,382
And Sam,
but she didn't know him.

776
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:51,051
What about Peter?

777
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:53,387
Mm, depends if he's still
useful or not.

778
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,931
The perpetrator
becomes the victim.

779
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:58,559
Wonder if the same holds true
for David Collins.

780
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:01,562
With Amelia,
anything's possible.

781
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:06,233
Three passports,
as requested.

782
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:07,735
Plane tickets?

783
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:11,196
No extradition.

784
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,073
Think you're
forgetting something.

785
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:15,409
For you? No way.

786
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:22,249
75K from the trunk
under the tree.

787
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,586
Which was a pain to dig up,
by the way.

788
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,421
How does he know
about the nest egg?

789
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,089
If we'd gone
to dig up that trunk,

790
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:32,134
we'd both be
in orange jumpsuits by now.

791
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:38,015
I prefer green.

792
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:42,436
Your cut. Ten grand.

793
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,770
Deal was 20.

794
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:45,772
Ten before, ten after.

795
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,943
After what?

796
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:51,445
I'm thirsty.

797
00:35:53,406 --> 00:35:55,824
Go on. Take her.

798
00:35:58,202 --> 00:35:59,453
Come on, Gracie.

799
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,131
You ready to do this?

800
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,799
If you really want me to.

801
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:18,097
All part of the plan.

802
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:21,642
Then we stop by the bank
on the way to the airport.

803
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:25,187
You go in and pick up
that 500 grand.

804
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:29,149
And I'm a wanted woman.

805
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:31,026
- Yes, you are.
- Mm.

806
00:36:34,905 --> 00:36:36,573
Hey, Mom,
come and check this out.

807
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:39,034
One minute, sweetie.
I'll be right there.

808
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,876
Grab Gracie.
Take her to safety.

809
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,338
Around the car on both sides.

810
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,137
- FBI! Hands in the air!
- FBI!

811
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,097
- Hands in the air!
- Stop right there.

812
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:01,083
- Nobody move!
- Mommy!

813
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:02,326
- Nobody move!
- Don't move! Don't move!

814
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,391
Hands up! Stay right there.

815
00:37:03,476 --> 00:37:05,894
Don't move! Don't move!

816
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:07,688
Boss, see two weapons.

817
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,359
Let Amelia go.

818
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:14,111
It's me you want.

819
00:37:14,195 --> 00:37:15,862
You sure about that?

820
00:37:15,946 --> 00:37:16,905
From where I stand,
it doesn't look

821
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:19,241
like a captor and his hostage.

822
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:20,784
Looks like a guy
who's been played.

823
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:24,496
Amelia doesn't love you, Peter.

824
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,081
He's lying.

825
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:28,250
Don't listen to him.

826
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,544
Telling the truth.

827
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:32,254
Mr. Collins over there,

828
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:34,381
he's the one
who sacrificed himself for her.

829
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:35,882
Right, David?

830
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:38,218
When she said, "If you really
love me, you'll jump"?

831
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:43,223
That's what you said to me...

832
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:45,642
before you made me kill Sam.

833
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:46,977
Peter.

834
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:49,730
Peter, I would never
betray you.

835
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:51,565
And I bet your son
and husband thought that

836
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:54,067
before they were shot dead
in their own home.

837
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:59,906
Don't do it, Peter.

838
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,618
You don't want this
to end the wrong way.

839
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:05,579
Let me guess, Amelia, you got
three passports over there:

840
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,956
One for you, one for Gracie,
and one for David.

841
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,250
Peter was never part
of the end plan.

842
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,088
David insisted.

843
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:17,591
If I wanted his help,
he had to come along.

844
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:19,426
And to bring his gun

845
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,929
so you could take care of Peter
before you left.

846
00:38:23,013 --> 00:38:24,598
You said you wanted me.

847
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,600
How could you do this?

848
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:27,935
Gracie's our daughter.

849
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:38,946
The only man you ever
really needed was your father.

850
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,781
And he was never there for you.

851
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,783
You just used those two.

852
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,535
You were gonna take the money
and your daughter

853
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,955
and run.

854
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,039
Am I right?

855
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,876
Put your hands
behind your back.

856
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,463
Hands behind your back!

857
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,007
Behind your back!

858
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:09,393
- Drop the weapon!
- No!

859
00:39:11,228 --> 00:39:12,337
Drop the weapon!

860
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:28,120
- Get off me!
- Hands behind your back!

861
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:30,580
Stop moving.

862
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:34,000
Gonna be okay. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

863
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:36,878
Look at me.
Take some deep breaths, okay?

864
00:39:36,962 --> 00:39:38,338
Take a deep breath. Barnes?

865
00:39:38,422 --> 00:39:40,090
Get EMT out here
as fast as they can.

866
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:41,794
- Copy that.
- All right, stay with me.

867
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,334
I'm gonna put some pressure
on it, all right?

868
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:45,011
You're gonna be fine, okay?

869
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:47,055
Stay with me. Stay with me.

870
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,018
- All good?
- Yeah.

871
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:54,187
Here. Let's get this pillow.

872
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:56,148
You should elevate
that bad boy.

873
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:59,067
I brought breakfast.

874
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:01,194
And I got your pills.

875
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:04,114
Pick whatever flavor you want.

876
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:05,031
Crosby.

877
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:07,534
Ah, must've left them
at the store.

878
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,745
It's okay. I'll go back.

879
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:11,371
Hey.

880
00:40:11,455 --> 00:40:14,416
I heard you're a musician.

881
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,709
You heard right.

882
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:18,545
Well, I'm looking forward
to hearing you play sometime.

883
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,798
Hana usually
puts in her headphones.

884
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,558
I am so sorry
I left your pills.

885
00:40:31,642 --> 00:40:32,726
You okay?

886
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,186
Not really.

887
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,607
I just keep replaying
what happened over and over.

888
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,500
Hana, you can't go there.

889
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,739
We learn how to deal
with this stuff all the time

890
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:47,220
in weapons retention class.

891
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:48,347
Exactly.

892
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:50,660
And what do they say?

893
00:40:50,744 --> 00:40:52,245
People sometimes go crazy

894
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:54,331
when they're
about to get arrested.

895
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:56,291
But you handled it.

896
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,709
And you probably
prevented the boss

897
00:40:57,793 --> 00:41:00,337
from taking a bullet
in the process.

898
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:02,756
So you gotta stop
beating yourself up

899
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,759
and tell me
what I can do to help.

900
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:07,594
You hungry?

901
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:09,137
You don't have
to play nurse.

902
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:11,264
But I want to. Come on.

903
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:13,642
I make a killer bologna omelet

904
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,602
or warm up lasagne.

905
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:16,937
Cheese crisp?

906
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:19,272
Save your cooking prowess
for Zadie.

907
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:20,983
You said she was
on a juice fast.

908
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:24,277
Let's be real.

909
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:26,112
I'm gonna be off my feet
for three weeks.

910
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:28,114
You've got a full-time job.

911
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:32,118
Zadie's great,
but she's unreliable.

912
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:34,287
I'm gonna go home to Darien,

913
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,289
to my mom and dad.

914
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:38,124
You sure?

915
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,293
Yeah. I'm sure.

916
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:41,336
Don't act like
you're not gonna enjoy

917
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,463
having the whole place
to yourself with Zadie.

918
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:46,299
Ah, you know I'm gonna hate
every minute of it.

919
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,016
Hey.

920
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:57,519
Can you give me a ride
to Darien later?

921
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:00,647
You got it.
