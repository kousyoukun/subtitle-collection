1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,060
举起手来 远离无线电
Hands up! Move away from the radio.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,280
我们没损坏任何东西
No harm's been done.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,670
你们被逮捕了
You're under arrest.

4
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,840
未经授权使用政府设施
Unauthorized use of government property.

5
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,630
行尸走肉 前情提要
Previously, on "The Walking Dead"...

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,280
把他们放了 不管如何
Let them go. You'll have to pay

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,630
你们最终会为自己的行为付出代价
for what you've done, one way or another.

8
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,460
这个地方有看上去那么好吗
Is this place really as good as it seems?

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
- 好多了 - 在这里我可以为其他人
- Better. - If I wanted to get help

10
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,940
寻求帮助吗
for people, I could do that here?

11
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,860
只要你遵守规则
As long as you follow the rules.

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,250
不对 我们漏了什么
No, we're missing something.

13
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,900
可能他们从后面逃跑了
Maybe they went out the back.

14
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,860
我可以去追他们
I can track 'em.

15
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,820
等等
Hold on.

16
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,300
和你说了
Told ya.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,090
等等
Wait.

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,400
休息一下 我们马上就到了
Take a minute, then we're almost there.

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,050
还有三英里
About three miles out.

20
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,880
你认真的吗
You can't be serious.

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,140
达里尔刚才还让我们回家
Daryl just told us to go home.

22
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,670
我没听见
I didn't hear that.

23
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,360
他是在暗示
Well, I think he was being subtle.

24
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,410
他说他们有很多哨兵
He said they were armed with lookouts.

25
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,110
达里尔知道我不会退缩的
And Daryl knows I would never turn back.

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,200
你怎么走下去 玛姬
How're you gonna keep going, Maggie, huh?

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,680
有什么武器
With what army?

28
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,030
Gabe 帮我说下话
Come on, Gabe, back me up here.

29
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,730
我们的人要饿死了
Our people are about to starve.

30
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,950
我不会空手而归的
I'm not going back to my family having failed.

31
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,730
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

32
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,740
起码承认你要求我们...
At least admit what you're asking of us...

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,130
为了什么 一袋豆子去冒生命危险吗
walking to our deaths for what, a sack of beans?

34
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,350
如果你更想保护自己
If you're more interested in saving yourself

35
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,440
而不是保护社区里的人
than protecting the people back home,

36
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,830
你可以走了
you can go.

37
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,050
我们不需要你
We don't need you.

38
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,840
我们都知道这不是真的
We both know that's not true.

39
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,450
好吧 这样
Alright, tell you what.

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,930
你在牧师面前...
You make me a promise...

41
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,670
保证我一件事...
in front of the goddamn preacher...

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,060
我就不走
and I will stick around.

43
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,850
保证什么
Promise you what?

44
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,500
我这次帮你
I do this for you,

45
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,330
我们就扯平了
and we're even, we are good.

46
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,030
我就不用一直担惊受怕了
I don't have to keep looking over my shoulder.

47
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,950
我们永远都不会扯平
We will never be even.

48
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,250
那你就会少一名
Then you are gonna be down a soldier

49
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,040
你急需的队员
that you desperately need.

50
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,910
你自己决定
Your call.

51
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,610
你会相信我的承诺吗
You'd take a promise from me?

52
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,220
真的吗
Really?

53
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,010
真的 谁不会呢
Yeah. Who wouldn't?

54
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,360
我觉得你是言而有信的人
I'm assuming you are a woman of your word.

55
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,620
我也一直都信守承诺
I've always been a man of mine.

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,900
怎么了
What is it?

57
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,420
是他妹妹最好的朋友
It's his sister's best friend.

58
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,290
Teresa
Teresa.

59
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,940
她只是个孩子
She was just a kid.

60
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,770
我们要找到他们
We have to get them.

61
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,300
所有人
All of them.

62
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,220
嘿
Hey.

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,050
你们也知道Blackbeard吗
Y'all know Blackbeard, too?

64
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,140
等等
Wait.

65
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,240
你觉得我们还能找到更多吗
Think we can find more?

66
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,920
你做的很好
You're doing great.

67
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,970
一般吧 没有很好
I'm doing okay, not great.

68
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,490
在评价自己之前
The timeline since this was last

69
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,320
要考虑这件事作为你每天的
an essential activity in your daily routine

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,750
基本必要活动
and the necessity for it

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,190
是多久以前了
should be factors in your self-judgment.

72
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,760
军队会为我们做这些
The military does this for us.

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,540
已经很久不需要我来做了
It's been so long since I've had to.

74
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,020
但这个不像骑单车
It's not like riding a bicycle, turns out.

75
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,330
你还是会忘了怎么做
You do forget.

76
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,770
那是敬业的小脑
That's the good ol' cerebellum

77
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,420
在保护你免受痛苦回忆的打扰 
protecting you from unpleasant memories.

78
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,600
我记得那些美好的东西
I remember the good stuff.

79
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,560
斯蒂芬妮 我要问下
Stephanie, I... I have to ask.

80
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,830
你认识霍恩斯比很久了吗
You've known Hornsby a long time?

81
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,920
挺久了 怎么了
Pretty long, why?

82
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,100
他能解决我们做的...
Is he capable of taking care of our...

83
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,400
违法事迹吗
transgressions?

84
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,010
换句话说
In other words,

85
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,150
做完这些劳工 我们会被放出去吗
will all this labor truly lead to our freedom?

86
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,630
如果他说会 那就会
If he says it will, it will.

87
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,940
兰斯有他自己的做事规矩
Lance has his own way of doing things.

88
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,510
但你可以信任他
But you can trust him.

89
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,470
你会知道的
You'll see.

90
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,220
让我来
Whoa. Let me take over.

91
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,040
- 我能搞定 - 我能帮忙 没事
- I got this. - I can help, it's fine.

92
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,740
- 不 有事 - 会没事的
- No, it's not! - It will be.

93
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,100
西结王
Ezekiel!

94
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,840
怎么了
What?

95
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,580
我爱你 但你要给我点空间
I love you, but you got to give me space, man.

96
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,450
你能把这些处理了吗
Can you just clear these?

97
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,370
天啊
God!

98
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,770
我把剩下的解决了
Think I got the last of them.

99
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,900
- 你没事吧 - 嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

100
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,640
没事
Fine.

101
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,430
对不起 我不是故意要发火的
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.

102
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,910
只是那里面太挤了
It's just so cramped in there.

103
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,820
没事没事
Nah, it's cool.

104
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,780
西结王 我能帮你什么吗
Ezekiel, what can I do?

105
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,260
有... 有些灰尘
It's... It's dusty.

106
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,880
就是因为这个
I'm sure that's it.

107
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,490
嗯
Mm-hmm.

108
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,880
需要帮忙清理你们的区域吗
Y'all need help clearing your area?

109
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,010
Steph 我们还要在这里做多久
Steph, how much longer we got to do this?

110
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,360
已经好几天了
It's been days.

111
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,800
可能还要几天吧我猜
Uh, a couple more, I guess.

112
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,150
他撑不了几天了
He won't make it a few more days.

113
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,670
我没事
I'm fine.

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,500
不 你需要见医生
No, you need to see a doctor.

115
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,420
我不会留你一个人在这里干活的
I'm not gonna leave you alone to work out here.

116
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,980
别傻了
Don't be stupid!

117
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,120
我就这么说了
Yeah, I said it.

118
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,200
他们这里有真正的医院
They got real hospitals and shit here.

119
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,950
你能帮忙吗
Can you make that happen?

120
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,080
嗯 我现在就去找霍恩斯比先生 
Uh, yeah, I'll talk to Mr. Hornsby right now.

121
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,390
谢谢 感激不尽
Thank you. We are much obliged.

122
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,480
如果这变成我们要用劳工来偿还的另一个债务
If this becomes another debt we have to work off...

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,530
我从来不怕干苦活
Never been afraid of hard work.

124
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,570
我可不喜欢朋友因为固执死去
Kinda anti friends who die from stubbornness.

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,800
默瑟 这离那些下贱的人
Mercer, this is way too close to

126
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,060
工作的地方也太近了吧
where the nasties are working.

127
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,970
这味道太... 恶心了
The smell is... revolting.

128
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,160
这人是谁啊
Who the hell was that?

129
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,640
我们的招募人员对你印象非常深刻
Our recruiters were incredibly impressed with you.

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,160
是吗
Were they?

131
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,040
我... 我以为他们觉得我很难搞
I... I thought maybe they found me difficult.

132
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,300
我们预料到你这种家庭背景的人
Well, we expect a person with your pedigree

133
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,080
要求会比较高
to have high standards.

134
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,000
在这里是这样的
We certainly do at State.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,310
米尔顿女士对她的哈佛校友们
Well, Ms. Milton has great affection

136
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,790
非常有感情
for her fellow Harvard grads.

137
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,010
帮你找到一个职位完全没有问题
Should be no trouble finding a position for you.

138
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,920
我很乐意用工作去支付你们对我社区的援助
I'm happy to work to pay for the aid for my community,

139
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,580
但我不会一直在这里的
but I'm not staying here permanently.

140
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,360
我先把这个说清楚了
I just want to make that clear.

141
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,800
可能你见了米尔顿女士后会改变主意
After you meet Ms. Milton, you might reconsider.

142
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,810
我还是想先见我的朋友们
I'd rather see my friends.

143
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,110
有人能带我去
Actually, can somebody take me to where

144
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,330
他们工作的地方吗
they're working, please?

145
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,590
他们触犯了法律
They broke the law.

146
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,380
霍恩斯比先生在他们完成惩罚后
Mr. Hornsby has arranged for their release

147
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,420
会放他们出来的
with a fine that they're repaying.

148
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,900
什么
What?

149
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,770
嗯 他们应该在为以后的开发区
Yeah, I believe they're clearing buildings

150
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,600
清扫建筑
for future development.

151
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,080
具体是清扫什么
Clearing them of what, exactly?

152
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,780
行尸们
The dead.

153
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,870
所以他们被安排去清理行尸
Okay, so they're assigned to clear walkers

154
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,480
几天 还是几周
for days, weeks?
