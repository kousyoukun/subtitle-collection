1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,690
手举起来  远离无线电
Hands up! Move away from the radio.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,380
我没造成任何损害
No harm's been done.

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,450
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

4
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,580
罪名是未经许可使用政府财产
Unauthorized use of government property.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,260
-放他们走  -你们仍要为所做的事付出代价
- Let them go. - You'll have to pay for what you've done,

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,410
不论以哪种方式
one way or another.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,710
这地方真有看起来那么好吗
Is this place really as good as it seems?

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,120
-比那更好  -如果我想替人求助的话
- Better. - If I wanted to get help for people,

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,090
在这里可以做到吧
I could do that here?

10
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,960
只要你遵守规则
As long as you follow the rules.

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,490
不  我们错过了什么
No, we're missing something.

12
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,050
也许他们从后门跑了
Maybe they went out the back.

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,060
我能追踪他们
I can track 'em.

14
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,920
等等
Hold on.

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,330
早说没人了
Told ya.

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,430
等等
Wait.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,440
先歇一会  然后我们就快到了
Take a minute, then we're almost there.

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,230
还有三英里
About three miles out.

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,910
你开玩笑吧
You can't be serious.

20
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,430
达里尔刚刚才叫我们回家
Daryl just told us to go home.

21
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,710
我可没听到
I didn't hear that.

22
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,480
我觉得他暗示了
Well, I think he was being subtle.

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,630
他说他们有望风的
He said they were armed with lookouts.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,210
达里尔知道我绝对不会回头
And Daryl knows I would never turn back.

25
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,570
你要怎么继续前进  玛姬
How're you gonna keep going, Maggie, huh?

26
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,980
带上什么军队
With what army?

27
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,910
拜托  小加  帮我说句话
Come on, Gabe, back me up here.

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,790
我们的人快饿死了
Our people are about to starve.

29
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,130
没找到粮食  我是不会回到家人身边的
I'm not going back to my family having failed.

30
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,570
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

31
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,810
至少承认你对我们的要求很过分
At least admit what you're asking of us --

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,560
为了一袋豆子逼我们去送死
walking to our deaths for what, a sack of beans?

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,820
如果你更想拯救自己
If you're more interested in saving yourself

34
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,130
而不是保护家里的人
than protecting the people back home,

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,640
那你可以走了
you can go.

36
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,870
我们不需要你
We don't need you.

37
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,940
我们都知道那不是真的
We both know that's not true.

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,350
好  这样吧
Alright, tell you what.

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,940
你向我保证一件事
You make me a promise --

40
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,690
在该死的牧师面前
in front of the goddamn preacher --

41
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,320
我就留下来
and I will stick around.

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,480
向你保证什么
Promise you what?

43
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,430
我为你做这件事
I do this for you,

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,390
那我们就扯平了  两不相欠
and we're even, we are good.

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,210
我不用一直担惊受怕
I don't have to keep looking over my shoulder.

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,300
我们永远不会扯平
We will never be even.

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,210
那你就要少一个你极度需要的士兵了
Then you are gonna be down a soldier that you desperately need.

48
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,330
你来决定
Your call.

49
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,320
你愿意接受我的保证
You'd take a promise from me?

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,670
真的吗
Really?

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,720
是啊  谁不会呢
Yeah. Who wouldn't?

52
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,760
我猜你是个信守承诺的女人
I'm assuming you are a woman of your word.

53
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,500
我一直都是个信守承诺的男人
I've always been a man of mine.

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,030
怎么了
What is it?

55
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,030
是他妹妹的闺蜜
It's his sister's best friend.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,700
特蕾莎
Teresa.

57
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,810
她只是个孩子
She was just a kid.

58
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,680
我们必须杀掉他们
We have to get them.

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,630
杀光他们所有人
All of them.

60
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,020
你们也认识黑胡子吗
Y'all know Blackbeard, too?

61
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,870
等等
Wait.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,490
还能找到更多吗
Think we can find more?

63
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,780
你做得挺好
You're doing great.

64
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,900
我做得还行  不算挺好
I'm doing okay, not great.

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,330
你自我评判时该考虑到
The timeline since this was last

66
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,380
战斗成为你日常生活中
an essential activity in your daily routine

67
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,830
必不可少的活动
and the necessity for it

68
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,150
已经是很久以前的事了  而且现在也没必要了
should be factors in your self-judgment.

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,130
军队会帮我们杀行尸
The military does this for us.

70
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,330
我已经很久没有亲自动手了
It's been so long since I've had to.

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,550
原来这并不像骑自行车
It's not like riding a bicycle, turns out.

72
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,510
这种事你是会忘记的
You do forget.

73
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,760
这是小脑在保护你
That's the good ol' cerebellum

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,840
远离不愉快的回忆
protecting you from unpleasant memories.

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,440
我记得美好的回忆
I remember the good stuff.

76
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,670
史蒂芬妮  我得问一句
Stephanie, I-I have to ask.

77
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,420
你认识霍恩斯比很久了吗
You've known Hornsby a long time?

78
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,360
挺久的  怎么了
Pretty long, why?

79
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,880
他能不能处理我们的...
Is he capable of taking care of our...

80
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,360
越轨行为
transgressions?

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,400
换而言之
In other words,

82
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,140
这些苦力活真的能让我们获得自由吗
will all this labor truly lead to our freedom?

83
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,140
如果他说会  那就会
If he says it will, it will.

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,970
兰斯有自己的行事方式
Lance has his own way of doing things.

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,310
但你可以信任他
But you can trust him.

86
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,530
你会知道的
You'll see.

87
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,970
-让我来接手  -我可以
- Whoa. Let me take over. - I got this.

88
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,880
我可以帮忙  没事的
I can help, it's fine.

89
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,270
-不  有事  -会没事的
- No, it's not! - It will be.

90
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,040
以西结
Ezekiel!

91
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,800
怎么了
What?

92
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,990
我爱你  但你得给我点空间
I love you, but you got to give me space, man.

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,150
你能拖走它们吗
Can you just clear these?

94
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,140
天啊
God!

95
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,880
我应该都杀完了
Think I got the last of them.

96
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,530
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

97
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,940
没事
Fine.

98
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,660
抱歉  我不是有意朝你发火的
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.

99
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,710
只是里面太挤了
It's just so cramped in there.

100
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,960
没事
Nah, it's cool.

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,890
以西结  我能做些什么吗
Ezekiel, what can I do?

102
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,110
只是灰尘太大了
It's -- It's dusty.

103
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,860
肯定是因为这个
I'm sure that's it.

104
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,360
需要我们帮忙清理你们的区域吗
Y'all need help clearing your area?

105
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,130
史蒂芬妮  我们还得搞多久
Steph, how much longer we got to do this?

106
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,980
已经好几天了
It's been days.

107
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,680
还要几天吧  我猜
Uh, a couple more, I guess.

108
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,180
他撑不了几天了
He won't make it a few more days.

109
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,380
我没事
I'm fine.

110
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,180
不  你得去看医生
No, you need to see a doctor.

111
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,490
我是不会抛下你一个人在这里干活的
I'm not gonna leave you alone to work out here.

112
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,840
别犯蠢了
Don't be stupid!

113
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,790
没错  我说出来了
Yeah, I said it.

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,210
他们有正儿八经的医院什么的
They got real hospitals and shit here.

115
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,020
你能帮帮忙吗
Can you make that happen?

116
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,020
可以啊  我马上去找霍恩斯比先生
Uh, yeah, I'll talk to Mr. Hornsby right now.

117
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,170
谢谢  我们非常感激
Thank you. We are much obliged.

118
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,510
如果我们又要通过劳动还这个人情...
If this becomes another debt we have to work off...

119
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,400
我从来不怕劳动
Never been afraid of hard work.

120
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,630
但我不喜欢朋友因固执而死
Kinda anti friends who die from stubbornness.

121
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,090
默瑟  这里离脏佬工作的地方太近了
Mercer, this is way too close to where the nasties are working.

122
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,970
这味道简直...恶心
The smell is... revolting.

123
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,860
那家伙是谁
Who the hell was that?

124
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,530
我们的招募员对你印象深刻
Our recruiters were incredibly impressed with you.

125
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,700
是吗
Were they?

126
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,140
我还以为他们会觉得我很难搞
I-I thought maybe they found me difficult.

127
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,720
我们料想到了你这种背景的人会要求比较高
Well, we expect a person with your pedigree to have high standards.

128
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,660
在联邦里反正是这样的
We certainly do at State.

129
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,130
弥尔顿女士对她的哈佛校友很有好感
Well, Ms. Milton has great affection for her fellow Harvard grads.

130
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,830
你应该很容易就能获得一个职位
Should be no trouble finding a position for you.

131
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,960
我很乐意为你们工作  换取对我社区的援助
I'm happy to work to pay for the aid for my community,

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,590
但我不会在这里久留
but I'm not staying here permanently.

133
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,160
我只想声明一下这点
I just want to make that clear.

134
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,740
你见过弥尔顿女士之后  也许会重新考虑
After you meet Ms. Milton, you might reconsider.

135
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,690
我更想见到我的朋友们
I'd rather see my friends.

136
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,280
话说  有人能带我去他们工作的地方吗
Actually, can somebody take me to where they're working, please?

137
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,480
他们违法了
They broke the law.

138
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,290
霍恩斯比先生安排他们接受惩罚后
Mr. Hornsby has arranged for their release

139
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,020
会释放他们的
with a fine that they're repaying.

140
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,420
什么
What?

141
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,820
嗯  他们应该正在为未来的发展
Yeah, I believe they're clearing buildings

142
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,310
清理建筑物
for future development.

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,270
具体是在清理什么
Clearing them of what, exactly?

144
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,190
行尸
The dead.

145
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,230
好的  所以他们被派去清理行尸几天几周
Okay, so they're assigned to clear walkers for days, weeks?

146
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,410
或许是几个月
Months, maybe?

147
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,270
与此同时你们希望我提供法律服务给...
And I'm expected to provide legal services to --

148
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,240
弥尔顿女士和她的内阁
Ms. Milton and her cabinet.

149
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,110
对
Right.

150
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,190
那我想和她谈谈
Then I'd like to speak with her.

151
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,610
立刻谈  谢谢
Right away, please.

152
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,670
这比较困难
Well, that would be difficult.

153
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,620
这又是为什么
Why is that exactly?

154
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,140
这和霍恩斯比先生预想的时机不太一样
It's just Mr. Hornsby's expectations of the timing were a little different.

155
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,810
他是你的上司吗
Is he your supervisor?

156
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,040
不是
No.

157
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,420
那我希望立刻和她谈
Then I'd like to speak to her right away.

158
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,850
拜托了
Please.

159
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,680
走吧  小子
Come on, boy.

160
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,690
那里面需要我帮忙吗
You need any help in there?

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,820
不用
No.

162
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,970
抽一根吗
You want one?

163
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,700
好啊
Sure.

164
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,790
给
Here you go.

165
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,660
谢了
Thanks.

166
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,350
他们回来了
Here they come!

167
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,240
开门
Open up!

168
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,530
这就开
On it, on it!

169
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,230
听上去是巡逻队回来了
Sounds like patrol has come home.

170
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,020
-放他们进来  -嗯
- Yo, let them in. - Yep.

171
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,930
在主里死去的人有福了
Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord,

172
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,110
圣灵说  是的  他们脱离劳苦得享安息
even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labors.

173
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,380
我们说  愿主与你和你的灵同在
We say, "The Lord be with you and thy Spirit."

174
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,100
阿门
Amen. Amen. Amen.Amen.

175
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,130
如果你妹妹还活着  我们会找到她的
If your sister's out there, we'll find her.

176
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,140
我们还会把这些凶手一个个找出来
And every last one of these murderers.

177
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,540
一个不落
All of them.

178
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,830
但那个人  他归我
But the one -- he's mine.

179
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,840
到处都有侦察兵
There are scouts everywhere.

180
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,010
我会小心的
I'll be careful.

181
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,860
如果你有机会除掉他们中的一员
If you get a chance to kill one of them,

182
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,890
如果有人落单  而你处于上风...
if he's alone and you have the advantage...

183
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,370
我会动手的
I will.

184
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,100
准备好了吗
You ready?

185
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,880
我不对我认识的人动刀
I'm not cutting up anyone I know.

186
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,520
你得给我找四个陌生人
You're gonna have to find me four strangers.

187
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,720
三个就够了
Only need three.

188
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,810
出于实用和留念  我还留着我的面具
I kept my mask for practical and sentimental reasons.

189
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,240
这事不是开玩笑
This is not fun.

190
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,550
你这态度可不行
Well, not with that attitude.

191
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,110
我们速战速决吧
Let's get it over with.

192
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,960
我们搜了三条线
We did three different sweeps.

193
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,860
到处都没有踪迹  长官
No signs of tracks anywhere, sir.

194
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,780
湖边的建筑搜了吗
You try the buildings out by the lake?

195
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,680
搜了  长官
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,050
-铁路沿线呢  -搜了  长官
-Along the train tracks? -Yes, sir.

197
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,940
公路下的通道呢
Freeway underpasses?

198
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,830
-搜过了  长官  -够了
-Yes, sir. -Oh, come on!

199
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,930
外面可是有几十个混蛋
There are dozens of these assholes out there!

200
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,870
-教皇  -不
- Pope. - No!

201
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,950
你们的兄弟死了
Your brothers are dead!

202
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,790
不感到羞愧吗
Are you not ashamed?!

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,970
还是说你们觉得这是可以接受的
Or do you think this is acceptable?!

204
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,130
他们是在听从我的建议
They were following my recommendations.

205
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,060
我告诉了他们最后一队去了哪里
I told them where the last teams went.

206
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,080
我告诉了他们接下来去哪里
I told them where to go next.

207
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,640
你想吼谁的话
You want to scream at somebody,

208
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,980
来吼我
scream at me.

209
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,150
你想当圣人吗  是这样吗  肖
You trying to be noble? Is that it, Shaw?

210
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,830
你想让他们喜欢你吗
You trying to get them to like you?

211
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,590
试试让他们活着
Try keeping them alive.

212
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,990
冲他们吼就能实现吗
And yelling at them is gonna do that?

213
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,320
让自己有点用
Go be useful.

214
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,770
带上你的男人
Take your boy over there

215
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,020
去找到那群该死的敌人
and go and find my goddamn enemies!

216
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,430
走吧  我们有命令了
Come on. We have orders.

217
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,860
留下
Stay.

218
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,430
你没事吧
You alright?

219
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,030
没事
I'm fine.

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
你刚才帮他们说话
I'm sure the guys are grateful

221
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,870
那些人肯定很感激你
for what you did back there.

222
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,820
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

223
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,560
换我肯定会
I'd be.

224
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,990
我不知道
I don't know.

225
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,620
可能是做了件蠢事
It may have been stupid.

226
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,370
不  你们找到了一个好地方
No, you got a good place.

227
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,380
我相信背后的故事一定很精彩
I'm sure there's a good story that goes with it.

228
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,230
你和那些人相处过一段时间
Well, you spent some time with those people.

229
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,020
我相信他们也有自己的版本
I'm sure they have their sides.

230
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,750
不  完全没有
No, not at all.

231
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,420
我们需要一个地方
Well, we needed a place.

232
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,540
我们找到了一个
We found one.

233
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,340
剩下的你可以自己脑补
You can fill in the rest.

234
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,570
你对此有什么想说的吗
You got something to say about it?

235
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,160
没有  我只是很惊讶
No. I'm just surprised is all.

236
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,510
为什么惊讶
Surprised why?

237
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,860
你们赢了
You won.

238
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,340
你们有围墙  有食物
You got the walls. You got the food.

239
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,410
为什么还要继续猎杀
Why keep hunting?

240
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,160
我们得确保他们不会再回来
We have to make sure they don't come back.

241
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,630
好吧
Okay.

242
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,560
你不明白
You know, you don't understand.

243
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,370
你自己一个人在外面很轻松
It's easy for you out here on your own,

244
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,060
只要考虑自己就行了
only having to worry about yourself.

245
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,770
我们需要保护整个社区
We have a whole community to protect.

246
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,410
我们有组织架构
And we have a structure.

247
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,240
有领袖带我们走到这里
And a leader who got us this far.

248
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,220
刚才发生的事情
What happened back there --

249
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,480
并不是常态
that was -- that wasn't normal.

250
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,760
是的  我遇见过那样的人
Yeah, I met guys like that before.

251
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,470
教皇有问题要解决  他被激怒了
Pope's got a puzzle to solve, and he's riled up.

252
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,620
这些人怎么会这么难找
How can these people be so hard to find?

253
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,960
所以  你杀掉所有人
So, you kill everybody,

254
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,900
然后他变回好人吗
and then he goes back to being a good guy?

255
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,530
他就像是我的父亲
He's like a father to me.

256
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,110
没人相信我时  他相信我
He believed in me when no one else would.

257
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,070
他让我变得更坚强
He made me strong.

258
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,930
我认为你不需要任何人来让你变得坚强
I doubt you ever needed anyone to make you strong.

259
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,710
肩膀放低
Lower your shoulders.

260
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,810
手臂松弛
Arms limp.

261
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,460
不错  玛姬
That's good, Maggie.

262
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,920
绑回树上
Back to the tree.

263
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,420
真是垃圾
This piece of shit.

264
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
不会和你完美贴合的
It's not gonna fit you perfectly.

265
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,880
这是别人的脸
It was... someone else's face.

266
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,580
这样也许真的能行
Look, this might actually work.

267
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,330
我是认真的
And I mean it.

268
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,110
如果我能做到  你也能做到
If I can do it, you can do it.

269
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,530
我把这个拿回去
I'll take this back,

270
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,510
改成适合你的大小
work on it, fix it for you.

271
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,240
然后我们再试一次
Then we'll try it again.

272
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,120
你刚才做得很好  玛姬
You did good, Maggie.

273
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,490
在主里死去的人有福了
Blessed are they who die in the Lord,

274
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,440
圣灵说  是的
so saith the Spirit.

275
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,980
在主里死去的人有福了
Blessed are they who die in the Lord,

276
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,690
圣灵说  是的  他们脱离劳苦得享安息
so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labors.

277
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,450
在主里死去的人
Blessed are they who --

278
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,350
告诉我  上帝
Tell me, Father.

279
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,430
您引领我度过最黑暗的时光
You have guided me through the darkest of times.

280
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,050
我珍视我们的对话和您给予我的指引
I treasure our conversation and the guidance you have given me.

281
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,250
有什么事情需要我知道吗
Is there anything I should know?

282
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,740
谢谢您  上帝
Thank you, Father.

283
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,790
今日就加入联邦军队
Enlist in the Commonwealth Army today.

284
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,400
帮助守护...
Help protect --

285
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,650
你休息多长时间
How long is your break?
帮助守护...
Help protect --

286
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,770
时间不长
Not long.

287
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,460
只够带你看看我的宿舍  然后就回去
Just enough to show you my dorm room and then get back.

288
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,640
你在这里一直住宿舍吗
You've always lived in a dorm here?

289
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,330
是的  很不错
Yeah. It's great.

290
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,010
托米  抱歉
Tomi, I'm sorry.

291
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,200
我不懂你为什么不想要
I-I just don't understand why you wouldn't want the life

292
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,110
在这里当医生  过更好的生活
that comes along with being a doctor here.

293
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,250
我不想回到过去
I don't want to go back to before.

294
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,560
这又不一样
Well, it wouldn't be the same.

295
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,550
爸爸没在这里给你施压
Dad isn't here to put pressure on you.

296
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,420
不只是因为爸爸
It wasn't just Dad.

297
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,630
你喜欢那种生活  但我不喜欢
And you liked that type of life, but I didn't.

298
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,050
永不松懈  永不休息
Never turning it off, never sleeping,

299
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,180
一切都运转得过快
everything moving too fast.

300
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,370
为了工作一直忙到累死
People who burn themselves out for work

301
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,260
或想自杀为止吗
until they die or want to?

302
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,810
为社区安全尽你的一份力
Do your part to keep our community safe.

303
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,720
你以前很喜欢那份工作的
Hey, you used to love the job.

304
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,910
我还记得你以前救人后
I remember how you used to look when you saved someone,

305
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,950
-还有你告知病人好消息后的表情  -求你停下
- when you told somebody good news. - Please stop. Please stop.

306
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,910
坐下
Sit.

307
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,990
不能有人知道我曾是医生  懂吗
No one can know that I was a doctor, okay?

308
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,640
答应我
Promise me.

309
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,050
-这是什么意思  -相信我  好吗
- What does that mean? - Just trust me, okay?

310
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,040
我喜欢现在的状态
I like things the way they are.

311
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,470
这地方行得通
This place makes sense.

312
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,180
-这里有秩序  体制  -好
- There's order, a system - Okay!

313
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,170
好
Okay.

314
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,580
行吧
Fine.

315
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,270
今日就加入联邦军队
Enlist in the Commonwealth Army today.

316
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,480
帮助守护你的邻居和我们的家园

317
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,430
记住  我们同舟共济
Remember, we're all in this together.

318
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,880
我过会儿要和帕梅拉·弥尔顿见面
I have a meeting with Pamela Milton later.

319
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,370
我应该知道些什么吗
Anything I should know?

320
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,450
这真是好事
That's nice for you.

321
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,520
像我这样的人永远见不上弥尔顿女士
Someone like me would never meet Ms. Milton.

322
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,530
为什么
Why not?

323
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,080
你必须知道自己的位置
You have to know your place.

324
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,810
你
You.

325
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,210
你们以为我做了什么
What do you think I did?

326
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,490
我没做错任何事  我发誓
I did nothing wrong, I swear.

327
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,210
住手  我是他的律师
Stop! I'm his lawyer.

328
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,770
-他有权听到自己的权利  -由美子  不要
He's entitled to hear his rights. Miko, Miko, no.

329
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,750
-由美子  别管了  -快走
- Miko, leave it alone. - Come on. Move it.

330
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,790
这就是联邦之道
That's the Commonwealth way.

331
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,760
我说过你会学会的
I told you you'd get it right.

332
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,070
恭喜  不用谢
Congrats and you're welcome.

333
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,840
他变了吗
Has he changed?

334
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,460
我们不能冒险知道
We can't know that.

335
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,320
他有作用
He's helpful.

336
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,970
他会起作用
He would be,

337
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,420
只要对他来说还有好处
long as there's something in it for him.

338
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,840
那你的承诺呢
So, your promise?

339
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,550
我希望我能遵守
I hope I can keep it.

340
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,140
关注一下你想要哪个
You know, keep an eye open for which one you want,

341
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,850
只要我们开始补充  你就能第一个选
because as soon as we restock, you've got first dibs.

342
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,900
我得跟你谈谈
Hey! I need to talk to you.

343
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,820
-我哥在哪  -他没事
- Where the hell is my brother? - He's fine.

344
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,340
这不是我的问题
That wasn't my question.

345
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,730
你和帕梅拉约好见面
You made an appointment with Pamela,

346
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,410
即使是在我对你和你的朋友们说
even after I told you and your friends

347
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,080
我正在处理一切之后
that I was taking care of things.

348
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,850
你差点搞砸了一切
You almost screwed everything up.

349
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,210
你从街上绑走了我哥
You kidnapped my brother off the street.

350
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,520
有道理
Fair enough.

351
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,380
他今晚就会回家  我只需要这么多时间
He'll be home tonight. That's how much time I need.

352
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,620
要这时间干什么
For what?

353
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,550
好  情况是这样  很简单
Alright, it works like this. It's real simple.

354
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,350
你的人需要帮助  对吧
Your people need help, right?

355
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,940
而你想要你犯了法的朋友们获得自由
And you want your friends, who broke the law, to go free.

356
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,730
这些都是很难办的事
Those are big asks.

357
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,760
我能为你办到
I can deliver for you.

358
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,070
你一定能得到某些好处
There must be something in it for you.

359
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,300
一个位高权重的朋友
A friend in high places.

360
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,000
日后我可能需要帮助
Someday, I might need a favor,

361
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,350
而你可能会还我这个人情
and you might be favorably inclined.

362
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,820
你怎么说
So what do you say?

363
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,190
你能再等几个小时吗
Can you sit tight for a few more hours?

364
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,980
只有几个小时
A few hours.

365
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,500
太好了
Excellent.

366
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,350
巡逻队彻查过这里
Patrol has been all through here.

367
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,340
他们搜过几英里内的每栋建筑
They've checked every building for miles.

368
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,870
应该没人来过的
These trails should be cold.

369
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,200
看起来有人来过
Well, it looks like someone's been through here.

370
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,530
小心
Heads up.

371
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,710
出来  举起手
Come out! Hands up.

372
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,470
求你们别开枪
Please, don't shoot.

373
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,640
我有需要我的家人
I-I-I have a family who needs me.

374
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,730
求求了
Please.

375
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,240
你住在那里吗
You staying over there?

376
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,000
-不  -你怎么躲过巡逻队的
- No. - How'd you avoid the patrols?

377
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,640
什么
What?

378
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,260
一直有士兵在寻找你这样的人
There's been soldiers looking for people like you.

379
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,410
你怎么躲过他们的
How'd you avoid them?

380
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,020
我不知道那是什么意思
I-I don't know what that means.

381
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,990
那你对我们来说没用了
Then you're of no use to us.

382
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,600
你不知道我们经历过什么
You don't know what we've been through.

383
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,210
我妻子受了很重的伤
My wife is hurt real bad.

384
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,640
我不能一边照顾她一边找食物
I can't -- I can't care for her and look for food.

385
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,010
求你们放我走
Please just -- just let me go.

386
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,600
带我们去看看
Show us

387
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,350
不然我就射死你  再去找你的家人
or I'll shoot and find your family later.

388
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,100
好
Okay.

389
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,060
求你们别伤害我们
Just please don't hurt us.

390
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,430
走
Move.

391
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,640
肖呼叫教皇

392
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,180
-等等  -请讲  肖
- Hold up. - Go ahead, Shaw.

393
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,720
我们在树林里发现了一个男人
We found a man in the woods.

394
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,680
不确定他是否属于目标团伙
Not sure if he's a part of our targets.

395
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,010
他要带我们去见他的人
He's taking us to his people.

396
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,610
你想要我们怎么处理
How do you want us to engage?

397
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,510
杀掉他们
Kill them.

398
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,350
收到
Copy that.

399
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,890
走
Move.

400
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,770
我理解你现在的感受
You know, I feel for you in all of this.

401
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,050
你也许认为我在胡说
You might think that's bullshit,

402
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,930
但这是真的
but it's true.

403
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,910
怎讲
How's that?

404
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,320
我不是机器人  李
I'm not a robot, Rhee.

405
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,110
看到你的朋友们变成行尸很不好受
It sucks to see your friends as walkers.

406
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,170
这就够受的了
And that would be enough.

407
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,240
而你打算做一些疯狂的事
But you are about to do some crazy shit

408
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,520
闯进一个你建立并失去的社区
and break into a community that you built and lost.

409
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,180
我理解的
I get it.

410
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,600
我们失去各自社区的方式非常不同
Your community and mine were lost in very different ways.

411
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,250
你以为我不知道被屠杀的一方是什么感受吗
You think I don't understand the losing side of a massacre?

412
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,050
卫星站里没有儿童
There were no children at the satellite station.
在与总督的战争中(S06E12)中  瑞克曾率人屠杀卫星站

413
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,740
没有家庭
No families.

414
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,060
那亚伦是从哪里找到格雷西的
Then where'd Aaron get Gracie?
格雷西父亲为救世军  被瑞克所杀(S08E02)

415
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,930
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know about that?

416
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,750
你不能跟我讨论作战计划
You can't debate battle plans with me.

417
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,650
残忍的程度
Levels of cruelty.

418
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,670
我只想说  我记得
Look, all I'm saying is that I remember

419
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,660
我的家园被侵略  我的人被杀时的情景
when my home was invaded and my people were killed.

420
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,720
那些人  他们也有朋友
Those men -- they had friends.

421
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,570
他们也有女朋友

422
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,940
他们亲友的悲痛是我无法抚平的
People that felt a loss that I couldn't heal.

423
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,020
我不得不向他们交代
And I had to explain to them why --

424
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,060
为什么他们的领袖没能保护好他们
why their leader failed to protect them.

425
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,440
你杀过有家人的人
You killed people who had families.

426
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,420
而且你是在他们家人面前杀的
And you did it in front of their families.

427
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:43,980
对
Yeah.

428
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,170
是的
I did.

429
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,460
但世界现在不同了  玛姬
But the world is different now, Maggie.

430
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,300
自己人和敌人都更少了
Fewer people to fight for, fight with.

431
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,040
见鬼  能争夺的东西也更少了
Hell, there's fewer things to fight over.

432
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,140
你是说要是换现在  你的做法会不同吗
Are you saying you'd do things differently?

433
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,600
对
Yeah.

434
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,720
对  如果重来一次
Yeah, if I could do it all over again...

435
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,440
我会杀光你们所有人
...I'd have killed every single one of you.

436
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
你为什么要这样说
Why would you say that?

437
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,530
这是真相
It's the truth.

438
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,500
为了保护自己人  我们必须不择手段
We got to do whatever we can to protect our people, right?

439
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,660
所以我们才会来这里
I mean, that's why we're here.

440
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,000
所以我们才在做这事
That's why we're doing this.

441
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,300
你为什么要对我说这种话
Why would you say that to me?

442
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,570
你和我今天相处得很好
We had a good day, you and I.

443
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,680
要想办成这事  玛姬  唯一的方法是
And the only way this works, Maggie, is --

444
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,020
我们要坦诚相待
is if we're honest.

445
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,140
他们要把尸体搬去哪
Where do they bring these, exactly?

446
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,400
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

447
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,520
远离农田和水源的地方吧
Somewhere far from the fields and the water supply.

448
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,100
朋友们
Friends!

449
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,340
非常感激
Much gratitude.

450
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,940
你们帮我干完了我的活儿
I see you've done all my work for me.

451
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,840
而我竟然没带点棒棒糖来
And I didn't even bring you lollipops.

452
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,020
等等
Wait.

453
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,620
你不吃吗
You don't want one?

454
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,200
我吃过好几根了
Oh, I have had several.

455
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,960
-情况如何  -又活过来了
- So, how was it? - Good as new.

456
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,260
给我开了抗生素  止痛药  输液
I got antibiotics, painkillers, IV fluids.

457

真心感谢你  朋友
Thank you, truly, friend.

Happy to do it.

459

很高兴你们都没事
Glad everyone's okay.

460
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,820
你们可以接受新任务了吗
You feel up to a new assignment or --

461
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,710
可以
Yes!

462
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,560
放马过来
Bring it on.

463
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,790
史蒂芬妮  尤金
Stephanie, Eugene,

464
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,120
我想要你们去清理北围栏
I'd like you to clear the area up along the north fence line.

465
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,230
-你能带他去吗  -当然

还在那里
It's still there.

471
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,800
你遇到他们的人了吗
You run into any of them?

472
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,630
没有
No.

473
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,420
那边看起来没问题
That looks good over there.

474
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,300
来吧
Come on, man.

479
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,790
这是在搞什么
What the hell was that about?

480
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,660
你们打扰了我们的约会
You just disrupted our date.

481

不好意思
Excuse me.

482
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,540
我们刚救了你们的命
We just saved your life.

483
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,460
私人警卫能保护我们
We have private security for that.

484
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,340
尤金  走吧  他们...
Eugene, let's go. They're --

485
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,250
你猜怎么着  这主意很好
You know what? Best idea yet.

486
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,490
你没理由这么无礼  伙计
Well, there's no reason to be so rude, hoss.

487
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,190
伙计
Hoss?

488
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,390
天啊  抱歉
Oh, my God. Sorry.

489
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,330
我只是不习惯和庶民讲话  所以
I'm just not used to talking to a plebeian, so this is --

490
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,530
有人在拽词啊
Oh, someone used their dictionary today.

491
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,220
-尤金  -稍等
- Hey, Eugene. - Now, just a minute.

492
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,250
我们应该得到感谢或道歉
We have earned either gratitude or an apology,

493
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,880
就看这位年轻人先说哪句了
whichever this young man can muster first.

494
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,000
-尤金  -你以为你是谁
- Eugene. - Who the hell do you think that you are?

495
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,120
我正在和一个
I think I'm talking to someone who's being

496
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,970
-非常无礼的人说话  -尤金
- extremely rude right now. - Eugene.

497
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,050
稍等片刻
Now just hold your horses one second.

498
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,850
-你根本不知道你在和谁说话  -尤金
- You have no idea who you're talking to right now. - Eugene.

499
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,250
我知道  我在和一个小男人说话
Oh, I think I do, and that would be a tiny, little man.

500
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,110
你很聪明是吧
You're so smart.

501
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,770
蠢婊子
You stupid bitch!

502
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,700
看你对我的女友做了什么
Look what you just did to my girlfriend!

503

老天  你做了什么

504
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,640
这家伙太混球了
This guy was being, well, an asshole.

505
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,490
-我们很抱歉  -别碰我
- Look, we're -- we're so sorry. - No, don't touch!

506
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,340
我们一直在不间断地工作
We've been working without a break,

507
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,610
他不是有意的
and he didn't mean to.

508
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,280
这里发生了什么
What the hell happened here?

509
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,000
看看他们对凯拉做了什么

这俩疯子袭击了我们
These lunatics attacked us.

511
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,810
都是你的错  墨瑟
You know, this is all your fault, Mercer.

512
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,190
你他妈的跑哪去了
Where the hell were you?!

513
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,520
我背后都是该死的腐尸
I had goddamn rotters up my ass!

514
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,140
然后这个蠢货过来攻击了我
And then this dumb shit rolled up and attacked me.

515
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,230
这错得非常离谱
That is categorically untrue.

516
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,360
你打他了吗
Did you hit him?

517
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,510
-是的  但是  -你在想什么
- Yes, but - What the hell were you thinking?
