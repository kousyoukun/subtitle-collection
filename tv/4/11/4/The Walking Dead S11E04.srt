1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,600
我说了别打了  每个人都能分到食物
I said break it up. There's enough food for everyone.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,680
-一周  -我们刚收留了两个新社区的人
- One week. - We just took in two new communities.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,760
我们没有庄稼和存粮
We have no crops, no back stock.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,870
我还知道一个地方  子午镇
I know one more place -- Meridian.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,830
之前我住在那
The place I lived before this.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,020
快跑
Run!

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,580
快走
Go! Go!

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,260
快跑
Run!

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,790
狗
Dog!

10
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,390
不  不
No! No!

11
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,190
放开它
Let him go.

12
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,820
我说了放开它
I said let him go.

13
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,370
我从没想过会再见到你
I never thought I'd see you again.

14
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,130
我也是
Yeah, I thought the same.

15
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,320
你在这里干什么
What're you doing out here?

16
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,720
你一个人吗
You alone?

17
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,810
你看我有同伴吗
You see anybody with me?

18
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,850
我在路上看见你和其他人一起
I saw you out on the road with the others.

19
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,920
他们是谁
Who are they?

20
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,630
你是他们的一员吗
You one of them?

21
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,850
我在路上碰到了一小队人
Crossed a small group on the road.

22
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,530
不  我不是他们的一员
No. I ain't one of them.

23
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,280
我独来独往  一向如此
I travel light, like always.

24
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,500
我们要走了  走吧  小子
We're gonna go. Come on, boy.

25
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,300
走吧
Come on.

26
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,110
-真有趣  -什么有趣
- Well, that's funny. - What's funny?

27
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,440
我一直以为它更喜欢你
I always thought he liked you better.

28
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,880
我不知道你在跟谁战斗
Look, I don't know who you're fighting,

29
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,820
但那与我无关
but I am not part of it.

30
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,180
我们要走了  走吧
We're going. Come on!

31
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,510
我们来看看你是否是对的
Let's see if you're right.

32
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,480
我为你回去了
I came back for you.

33
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,720
我曾到处找你
I looked everywhere for you.

34
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,830
很抱歉你和这些人沦落到了一起
I'm sorry you ended up with these people.

35
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,190
这些人是我的家人
These people are my family.

36
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,600
他们可没有停止找我
They never stopped looking for me.

37
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,440
当他们找到我时  我回家了
When they found me, I came home.

38
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,280
你的家人呢  达里尔
How about your family, Daryl?

39
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,650
你跟我说过的那些家人
The ones you told me about?

40
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,410
他们就是路上的那些人吗
That who was out on the road?

41
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,840
很久以前  我的家人惹错了人
My family picked the wrong fight with the wrong people a long time ago.

42
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,170
就像我跟你说的  我独自一人
It's like I told you, I'm alone.

43
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,980
你真脏
You're filthy.

44
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,360
抬起来
Up.

45
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,070
再问一次
Again!

46
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,920
其他人
The others.

47
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,560
他们还在外面吗
Are they still out there?

48
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,630
他们在附近吗
Are they close?

49
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,070
我不知道
I don't know.

50
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,210
谁是首领
Who's the leader?

51
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,270
是那个女人吗
Is it the woman?

52
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,660
我不是他们的人
I ain't one of them.

53
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,750
胡扯
Bullshit.

54
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,480
够了
Enough.

55
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,280
肖
Shaw?

56
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,880
我说了停下
I said stop.

57
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,820
我来对付他
I'll handle him.

58
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,080
他会开口的  只需要再给我一点时间
He'll crack. I just need a little more time.

59
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,960
我已经给你足够时间了
I've given you enough time already.

60
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,970
我说了抬起来
I said up!

61
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,330
我需要你配合
I need you to cooperate.

62
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,260
我跟你交代了一切
I told you everything.

63
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,590
你什么都没说
You told us nothing.

64
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,220
说
Talk.

65
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,620
我们的上司可没这么好说话
The one we answer to won't be so nice.

66
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,040
我和他们做过交易
I traded with them.

67
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,520
他们给了我些食物
They gave me some food.

68
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,670
我帮忙搬些东西
I hauled some gear.

69
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,580
我和他们认识还不到一星期
I knew them less than a week.

70
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,090
来啊  你可以杀了我
Go ahead, kill me if you want.

71
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
我没什么别的可说了
I got nothing else to say.

72
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,720
我们就不该把他带回来
Should've never brought him back.

73
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,730
我知道自己在干什么
I know what I'm doing.

74
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,490
可不  你一直这么说
Yeah, you keep saying that.

75
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,230
达里尔
Daryl?

76
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,530
是你吗
Is that you?

77
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,450
其他人呢  他们还好吗
The others? Are they okay?

78
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,620
我不知道你的朋友们在哪
I don't know where your friends are.

79
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,990
我也不在乎
I don't care, neither.

80
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,060
-但是...  -没什么可但是的
- But I -- - But nothing.

81
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,800
我们不过是分享过食物而已
Just 'cause we shared a bag of grain

82
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,070
这不意味着我在乎你们
does not make me give a shit about you.

83
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,540
听明白了吗
Understand?

84
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,010
无论你们和这帮人有什么过节
Whatever beef you have with these people,

85
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,590
我都不想掺和
I want no part of it.

86
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,530
听见了吗
You hear me?

87
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,540
你最好闭上嘴  别来烦我
You need to shut up and leave me alone.

88
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,750
懂了吗
Got it?

89
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,330
懂了
I got it, yeah.

90
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,080
我没看错你
I was right about you.

91
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,870
当初就应该让你饿着
Shoulda let you starve.

92
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,700
王八蛋
Asshole.

93
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,240
我一个字都不会透露给你们的
I ain't telling you bastards a thing.

94
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,950
起来  起来
Get up. Get up!

95
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,400
放开我
Let me go!

96
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,040
和从前一样固执
Just as stubborn as ever.

97
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,430
你就是这么认为的吗
Is that what you think this is?

98
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,100
我固执
Me being stubborn?

99
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,890
好吧
Fine.

100
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,790
是坚韧
Hard-headed.

101
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,710
你得把真相告诉我
You need to tell me the truth.

102
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,300
我从来没有骗过你
I've never lied to you.

103
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,260
从来没有  莉娅
Never, Leah.

104
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,430
现在也不会
I'm not gonna start now.

105
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,110
我们再试一遍
Let's try this again.

106
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,070
关于那群人  你都了解些什么
What do you know about those people?

107
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,640
我什么都不了解
I don't know shit.

108
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,360
如果我可以  我肯定会帮你
I'd help you if I could.

109
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,580
你知道我会的
You know I would.

110
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,890
把狗还给我  放我走吧
Just give me Dog, let me go,

111
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,920
你再也不会见到我了
you'll never see me again.

112
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,760
这就是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

113
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,750
怎么了
What is it?

114
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,930
找到博西了
Found Bossie.

115
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,500
特纳呢
And Turner?

116
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,510
我努力过了  但没能救他
I tried. I couldn't save him.

117
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,310
-我努力过了  -没关系  孩子
- I tried. - It's okay, son.

118
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,820
你做了正确的事
You did the right thing.

119
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,500
你把他带回家了
You brought him home.

120
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,510
主啊  我们把兄弟特纳交给你
Lord, we release our brother Turner to you.

121
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,770
请您拥紧他
Please, hold him close.

122
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,620
以主之名  阿门
In your name, oh Lord, amen.

123
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,640
阿门
Amen.

124
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,180
上帝在此
God is here.

125
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,370
他很愤怒
He's angry.

126
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,200
我很愤怒
I'm angry.

127
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
你们感受到了吗
Do you feel that?

128
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,810
去让他们感受到我们的怒火
Go make them feel our wrath.

129
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,440
怎么了
What happened?

130
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,760
我有一个兄弟死了
One of my brothers is dead.

131
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,100
他叫迈克尔·特纳
Michael Turner was his name.

132
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,430
我们曾在世界各地并肩战斗
We fought all over the world together.

133
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,510
我们最后一次驻扎回来后  教皇将他纳入麾下
Pope brought him in after our last tour,

134
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,050
那时他刚创办公司
when he started his company.

135
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,560
我以为你们是士兵
I thought you were soldiers.

136
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,900
我们曾经是
We were.

137
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,030
之后私营化了
Then we went private.

138
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,390
你之前没告诉过我你是佣兵
You didn't tell me you were a merc.

139
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,840
这重要吗
Mm, does it matter?

140
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,020
都是一样的工作
I mean, it's the same damn job.

141
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,930
只是我们真能付得起生活费了
Except we could actually pay our bills.

142
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,680
迈克尔跟我很像  他也没有家人
Michael was like me, you know? He didn't have a family.

143
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,820
他就是我没能拥有的弟弟
He was the little brother I never had.

144
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,400
我一直想要的弟弟
You know, the little brother I always wanted.

145
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,820
现在他死了
And he's dead.

146
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,850
我们在这里失去过很多同伴
You know, we lost a lot of people...

147
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,280
一直很艰难
here, and it's been hard.

148
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,290
但这次不一样
Not like this.

149
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,540
这是我
This is the first time

150
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,320
很长时间以来第一次失去了亲近的人
I've lost someone close to me in a long time.

151
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,550
好吧
Well...

152
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,470
或许除了你
except maybe for you.

153
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,100
你那时并没失去我
You didn't lose me.

154
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,490
我回去找过你  但你走了
I came back and you were gone.

155
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,110
你离开了我
You left me.

156
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,720
我问你你想要什么
I asked you what you wanted.

157
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,880
你就走了
You left.

158
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,340
我害怕了
I got scared.

159
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
怕什么
Of what?

160
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,820
放手
Letting go.

161
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,520
无所谓了  反正我们也不会有结果
It doesn't matter. It wouldn't have worked anyway.

162
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,410
不可能拥有幸福
Couldn't have been happy.

163
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,880
在这样一个世界里不可能
Not in a world like this.

164
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,050
这是你的想法还是你家人的
Is that you talking or your family?

165
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,650
难道你就没做过坏事吗
Like you've never done things?

166
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,540
杀人
Killed people.

167
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,030
我知道你做过什么
I know the things you've done.

168
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,780
你没权利指责我  根本没有
You have no right to judge, not at all.

169
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,230
这就是真正的我  达里尔
This is me, Daryl.

170
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,810
不论是好的还是坏的
The good and the bad.

171
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,610
全都是我  一直如此
All of it. It always has been.

172
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,450
我不相信
I don't believe you.

173
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,810
那我也没办法
Well, I can't help with that.

174
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,860
但我可以帮你救自己
But I can help you save yourself.

175
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,160
因为不管怎样  我仍在乎你
Because despite everything, I still care about you,

176
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,280
我不希望你发生不好的事
and I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

177
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,940
所以你必须交代点什么
So, you need to tell me something.

178
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,850
任何事都行
Anything.

179
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,570
如果你不说  我就控制不了我的指挥官
'Cause if you can't, I can't control my commander

180
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,020
以及他的下一步行动
or what he will do next.

181
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,630
特纳的死令他愤怒不已
He's angry about Turner,

182
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,930
他要找人付出代价
and he wants someone to pay.

183
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,610
有个女人
There's a woman.

184
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,440
她是首领
She's the leader.

185
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,900
他们用暗语交流  因为我是外人
They were speaking in code 'cause I was an outsider.

186
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,670
有一个高瘦的男人
There was a tall, skinny guy.

187
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,480
是个话痨
Never shuts up.

188
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,290
还有个背着猎枪的神父
And a priest who carries a shotgun.

189
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,220
那是他们的领导层吗
That's their leadership?

190
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,860
是的  但他们有人数优势
Yeah. But they have the numbers.

191
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,960
其中一个士兵说漏嘴了
And one of their soldiers slipped up,

192
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,840
他要去找他们那三十几个战士
and he was gonna go meet three dozen of their fighters.

193
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,710
比你这里的十五个士兵多得多
That's way more than the 15 you got here.

194
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,040
看来你被关在这也没闲着
Well, you've been doing your work down here, huh?

195
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,260
我今晚会叫人把你放出来
I'll have you moved out of here tonight.

196
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,210
这样你能舒服些
so you can be more comfortable.

197
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,480
我何时能见到他
When do I meet him?

198
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,300
教皇
This Pope?

199
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,140
快了
Soon.

200
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,770
你说得对
Well, you were right.

201
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,690
他很难降服
He was hard to break.

202
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,780
他告诉我  敌人比我们想象中要多得多
He told me there are a lot more out there than we thought.

203
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,170
比我们这里的人数多两倍以上
More than twice the force we have in here.

204
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,260
我认为他适合这里
I think he'll be good here.

205
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,270
而且我们需要人手
And we need the manpower,

206
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,010
特纳死了
with Turner gone

207
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,220
尼科尔斯和蒙塔尼奥仍下落不明
and Nicholls and Montanio still missing.

208
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,320
说句话
Say something.

209
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,650
我知道我讨厌你这样做
You know I hate it when you do this.

210
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,040
做什么
Do what?

211
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,550
晾着我
Freeze me out.

212
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,550
一切不是围着你转的  莉娅
Not everything is about you, Leah.

213
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,650
我从没这样说过
I never said it was.

214
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,300
是吗
Oh, no?

215
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,460
因为我们在这里
'Cause here we are.

216
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,190
浪费了一天追踪敌人的时间  只因为你
Losing a day of tracking our enemy 'cause you --

217
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,330
你要对老男友进行希望渺茫的审问
you had to go on a fishing expedition with an old boyfriend.

218
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,810
继续吧
So, go on, then.

219
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,820
告诉我
Tell me.

220
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,480
你查到想查的事了吗
You find what you're looking for?

221
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,290
我说过他有用  我说对了
I told you he would be useful, and I was right.

222
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,530
他很像我们
He's a lot like us.

223
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,780
他不怕痛苦  他不怕死亡
Pain doesn't scare him, death doesn't scare him.

224
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,510
卡弗看到了
Carver saw it.

225
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,150
拜托  你也看到了
Come on, you see it.

226
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,250
我只看到了一个想上你的男人
I just see a guy who wants to get in your pants.

227
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,560
好吧
Fine.

228
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,170
好吧
Fine.

229
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,440
他是忍不住盯着他所爱过的人
Who couldn't stop gazing at somebody he loved.

230
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,790
我没说过他爱过我
I never said he loved me.

231
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,850
你今天本可以在外面杀了他
You could've ended him out there today,

232
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,590
而你没下手
and you didn't.

233
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,340
为什么
Why?

234
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,890
他曾对我有所意义
At one point, he meant something to me, yeah.

235
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,990
我对此没有隐瞒
I've been open about that.

236
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,670
但在你找到了我  我选择了这个大家庭的那天
But it ended the day you found me

237
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,170
这一切就结束了
and I chose this family,

238
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,220
我从没有后悔过做出那个决定
and I have never once regretted that decision,

239
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,360
我也不希望你后悔
and I don't want you to, either.

240
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,370
你后悔吗
Do you?

241
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,470
我更相信你
I believe in you.

242
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,460
相比其他人来说
More than the others.

243
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,090
我知道
I know.

244
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,600
你觉得我们可以信任他吗
You think we can trust him?

245
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,160
可以
Yeah.

246
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,990
好
Good.

247
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,690
让我亲眼看看
Now, let me see for myself.

248
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,270
有话要说吗
You got something to say?

249
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,250
说吧  别害羞
Come on, man. Don't be shy.

250
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,650
你就要见老大了
You're about to meet the man.

251
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,560
这怂样留给你女友吧
Yeah, save that coy shit for your girlfriend.

252
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,800
肖才不是谁的女友
Aww, Shaw ain't nobody's girlfriend.

253
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,950
我敢打赌这小子什么都听她的
I'm betting she wears the pants with homeboy here.

254
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,160
你说是不是
Isn't that right?

255
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,070
你屁都不懂  卡弗  闭嘴吧
You don't know shit about shit, Carver. Knock it off.

256
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,210
那我还是出去吧
I guess I'll just show my dumb ass out, then.

257
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,910
教皇快来了
Pope is on his way.

258
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,680
在我见他之前  你想提醒我什么吗
Anything you wanna tell me about this guy before I meet him?

259
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,470
看我眼色行事
Just follow my lead.

260
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,520
给  拿着
Here! Take it! Take it!

261
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,260
用这个
Here! Here!

262
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,460
快
Come on.

263
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,110
由火铸就
Forged by fire.

264
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,980
由神指定
Ordained by God.

265
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,950
欢迎他
Welcome him!

266
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,690
出自《圣经》拉丁语版钦定本诗篇140:8
指上帝在争战之中赐予我勇气
赴汤蹈火
Fortitudo Saludis!

267
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,070
你信上帝吗
You believe in God?

268
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,910
不信
No. No, I don't.

269
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,440
不再信了
Not anymore.

270
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,320
我现在只信自己
Guess I just believe in me now.

271
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,980
这是个错误
Well, that's a mistake.

272
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,060
-为何  -因为你不是上帝
- Why's that? - 'Cause you're not Him.

273
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,610
我通过了你的小测试
I passed your little test, didn't I?

274
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,480
无论你怎么称呼那事
Whatever you want to call it.

275
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,610
你以为这就结束了吗
Oh, and you think that's the end of it?

276
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,700
你还想要我做什么
What else do you want from me?

277
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,170
我想要
I want...

278
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,220
我想要你理解
I want you to understand.

279
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,800
坐
Sit down.

280
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,330
我们都是在死亡谷认识的
We all met in the Valley of Death.

281
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,370
反正我们是这样称呼那里的
That's what we call it, anyway.

282
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,290
阿富汗的山区
Hills of Afghanistan.

283
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,280
我们为国奋战
We fought for our country,

284
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,240
把阵亡的战友抬下战场
carried our fallen brothers off the field.

285
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,660
抬了太多人  后来我们都数不清了
Carried so many, we lost count after a while.

286
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,320
政客们
Politicians.

287
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,390
只管开支票
They wrote the checks.

288
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,560
根本不在乎我们
We weren't anything to them.

289
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,020
我们只是道具
Just props.

290
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,960
下次竞选所用的道具
Props for their next campaign.

291
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,490
他们喜欢谈论上帝
See, they -- they talked about God.

292
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,870
他们不认识上帝
They didn't know God.

293
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,280
他们没见过他的脸
They never saw His face.

294
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,060
不像我们
It's not like we did.

295
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,650
我们看到上帝无处不在
We saw God everywhere.

296
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,210
他在鲜血  恐怖和死亡之中
He was in the blood and the horror and death.

297
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,860
他在那  为我们指引方向
He was there, telling us where to go.

298
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,800
在那段日子里  我们唯有指望他
Didn't have much else to hold on to in those days but Him.

299
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
还有彼此
And each other.

300
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,270
你抽烟吗
You smoke?

301
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,970
那场战争差点永远废了我们
That war damn near ruined all of us for good.

302
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,900
回国之后  我的部下都有永久性损伤
Came home and my guys had permanent injuries.

303
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,450
他们睡不着觉  找不到正经工作
They couldn't sleep. They couldn't find real jobs.

304
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,520
所以
So...

305
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,270
我们成了人们口中的佣兵
people called us mercenaries.

306
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,620
那些没人想做的脏活累活
We did all the ugly, dirty work

307
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,590
都由我们来做
nobody else wanted to do.

308
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,480
还拿到了丰厚的佣金
Got paid for it, too. Handsomely.

309
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,860
真正的脏活是在沦陷之后开始的
The real dirty work started after the Fall.

310
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,230
我从没有经历过那样的战争
Never been in a war like that.

311
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,610
从没有见过那样的混乱
Never seen that kind of chaos,

312
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,990
而我以前什么都见过
and I had seen everything.

313
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,620
但这个
But this...

314
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,170
我们做的那些事
Oh, the things we did.

315
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,430
所有的死亡  日复一日
All that death, day after day after day...

316
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,580
不久以后  我和你有了同样的想法
After a while, I started to feel like you.

317
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,770
我在想  上帝哪去了
Wondering -- Wondering where God was.

318
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,950
直到他再次现身
Until He showed His face again.

319
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,900
政客们  还有最后一场仗要打
See, politicians -- they had one last war to get behind.

320
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,430
这一次  敌人是我们
This time, coming for us.

321
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,690
炸弹如暴雨般落下
The bombs came thick and fast.

322
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,150
一直没有停
It did not stop.

323
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,980
我们和一些战友走散了
We lost some of our own,

324
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,090
不得不穿越大火去救他们
had to run through the fire to save them.

325
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,940
我们在城镇边缘找到了一座小教堂
Found this little church at the edge of town,

326
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,660
我们躲在那里  看着一切
and we holed up there as everything --

327
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,940
我是说所有的一切  在身边燃烧
and I mean everything -- burned around us.

328
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,030
等火终于熄灭了
When the fires finally died down,

329
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,600
我看向我的部下
I looked at my people...

330
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,090
我简直不敢相信
I could not believe it.

331
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,560
没留一滴血
Not a trace of blood.

332
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,460
没有烧伤
No burn marks.

333
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,550
连擦伤都没有
Not even a scratch.

334
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,770
那时我就知道了
And that's when I knew.

335
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,270
我们是天选之人
We were the Chosen Ones.

336
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,650
这些人
These men --

337
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,780
火焰伤不了这些人的身躯
These men upon whose bodies the fire had no power.

338
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,230
上帝今晚选中了你
God chose you tonight.

339
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,230
你毫发无伤  活着逃出了火场
I mean, you -- you came out of that fire alive and whole.

340
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,130
看看你  现在坐在这里
And look at you now, sitting right here.

341
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,870
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

342
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,850
被烧到了吗
Any burns?

343
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,110
有擦伤吗
A scratch?

344
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,350
我以前经历过更糟的事
I've been through worse before.

345
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,450
你饿吗
Are. You. Hungry?

346
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,500
你说得对
You were right.

347
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,550
关于这家伙
About this one.

348
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,880
我当然对了
Of course I was.

349
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,040
分他点  博西
Give him some, Bossie.

350
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,790
别太贪
Don't be greedy.

351
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,770
他现在是家人了
He's family now.

352
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,380
你知道他做了什么吧
You know what he did, don't you?

353
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,380
他背着死去的兄弟走了10英里
He walked 10 miles with his dead brother on his back.

354
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,190
10英里
10 miles.

355
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,800
这需要多大的力量啊
The strength that took...

356
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,360
你知道我们有多感激吗
You have any idea how grateful we are?

357
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,040
特纳会有一个体面的葬礼
Turner will have a proper burial.

358
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,750
我只是做了我们都会做的事
Just did what any one of us would've done.

359
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,000
还疼吗
These still hurt?

360
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,630
需要什么吗
You need anything?

361
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,220
我只想问一个问题
I just have one question.

362
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,730
好
S-Sure.

363
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,720
有件事我一直很困惑
Something's been bothering me.

364
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,630
你的伤口
Your wounds...

365
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
在背上
are on your back.

366
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,360
教皇  今天已经够辛苦了
Pope, it's been a rough day.

367
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,960
我只是想弄清楚  肖
Just getting clarity, Shaw.

368
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,510
特纳被袭击时  你在哪里
Where were you when Turner was being attacked?

369
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,610
我在现场  我给你说过了
I-I was right there, just like I told you.

370
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,710
面朝敌人吗
Facing the enemy?

371
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,710
对
Yeah.

372
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,200
他受的苦够多了
He's been through enough.

373
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,690
害怕了会跑是人的本能反应
Human nature is to run when you are scared.

374
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,790
你懂的吧
You know what that's like, right?

375
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,480
直面恐惧需要非凡的勇气
It takes divine strength to face your fear head-on.

376
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,240
为别人赌上一切
Risk everything for someone else.

377
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,710
我们都看到了你所做的事
We all saw what you did.

378
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,130
先把肖救出火场  你也感受到了吧
Getting Shaw out of the fire first, and you felt it, huh?

379
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,710
为了保护你  他愿意做到什么地步
How far he would go just to keep you safe.

380
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,970
今天  上帝用火洗礼了你
Today, God baptized you in that fire.

381
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,440
让你成了我们的一员
Made you one of us.

382
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,360
不过
You see...

383
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,290
我忘了告诉你一件事
there's one thing I forgot to tell you.

384
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,970
永远不要背弃你的兄弟
Never turn your back on your brother.

385
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,280
上帝不只用火来洗礼
God doesn't only use fire as His baptism.

386
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,860
他也用火来表达愤怒
It's also His wrath.

387
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,780
我们是天选之人
We are the Chosen Ones!

388
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,640
我们奔向战场
We run into the battle.

389
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,610
我们奔入火场
We run into the fire.

390
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,700
永远如此
Always.
