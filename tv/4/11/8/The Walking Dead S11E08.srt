1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,700
是啊  我们得彻底修好
Yeah, we need a long-term fix.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,160
如果我们没法保证亚历山大的安全
If we can't make Alexandria safe,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,390
那我们就得开始考虑其他选项了
we need to start thinking about other options.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,550
亚历山大是我们的家
Alexandria's our home.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,050
我还没准备好抛弃它
I'm not ready to abandon ship.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,920
你们的兄弟死了
Your brothers are dead!

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,820
不感到羞愧吗
Are you not ashamed?!

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,120
我们必须杀掉他们  杀光他们所有人
We have to get them -- all of them.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,470
我们需要保护整个社区
We have a whole community to protect.

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,470
教皇有问题要解决  他被激怒了
Pope's got a puzzle to solve, and he's riled up.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,640
这些人怎么会这么难找
How can these people be so hard to find?

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,570
大概一小时前看见了它们
Spotted them about an hour ago.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,200
它们为什么这样移动
Why are they moving like that?

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,570
无缘无故吧
No reason.

15
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,790
错了
Wrong.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,690
事出必有因
There's a reason for everything.

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,920
你觉得呢  迪克森
What about you, Dixon?

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,080
你见过腐尸这样移动吗
You ever seen rotters move like that?

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,050
嗯  我之前见过
Yeah. Yeah. I've seen that before.

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,830
在南边  我也不知道为什么
South of here. Don't know why it happens.

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,440
它们聚在一起  集体行动
They just gather up a whole bunch of them and move off.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,760
我们可以干掉它们
Could take them down,

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,470
就像在罗克维尔的医院一样
like we did at that hospital in Rockville.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,490
小菜一碟
Easy.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,720
上次你差点死了  我还得救你的命
Till you almost bought it and I had to save your ass.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,650
那时候才好玩呢
That was just when things were getting fun.

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,810
我可以引它们去两英里外的地方  然后再折返
I can lead them out about two miles and just double back.

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,650
没那么麻烦  风险也更低
Less work, less risk.

29
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,950
也更怂
Yeah, less balls.

30
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,800
我们按迪克森的方法办
We'll try it Dixon's way.

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,500
好
Alright.

32
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,940
威尔斯
Wells.

33
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,750
你觉得你能引开那些腐尸吗
You think you could move those rotters?

34
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,980
能  长官
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,000
我可以的  我之前就做过
I can do it. I've done it before.

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,470
威尔斯来办
Wells can handle it.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,210
吹笛人  尸群引得怎么样了
Hey, Pied Piper. How's the pipin'?

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,590
你开玩笑吗
You kiddin'?

39
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,360
我简直是舞会之花  它们都爱我
I'm the belle of the ball out here. They love me.

40
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,280
好吧  美人儿
Alright, Belle.

41
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,520
快点  丑八怪
Step it up, ugly.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,430
天色晚了  我也饿了
It's getting late, and I'm getting hungry.

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,730
快点
Come on, man.

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,280
快点
Come on.

45
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,920
长官  有情况
Sir, we have a situation here.

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,650
什么情况
What kind of situation?

47
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,240
威尔斯  收到了吗
Wells, do you copy?

48
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,510
那扇门怎么了
What's with that door?

49
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,890
烂了
It's rotted out.

50
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,240
暴风雨要是继续  它会散架的
This storm keeps up, it'll shake apart.

51
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,100
我去看看婴儿们
I'll check on the babies.

52
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,400
只是打雷
It's only thunder.

53
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,250
伤不到人的
It can't hurt.

54
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,920
还记得妈妈是怎么说暴风雨的吗
Remember what Mom said about storms?

55
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,240
暴风雨过后总有晴空
They're always followed by clear skies.

56
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,730
真希望她在这里
I wish she was here.

57
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,970
我知道  我也是
I know. Me too.

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,460
待在这里
Stay here.

59
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,270
-让开  -好  把门关上
- Move! - Okay. Keep it closed!

60
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,260
大家都没事吧
Is everyone okay?

61
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,240
情况更糟糕了
That's even worse.

62
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,460
那是什么
What was that?

63
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,890
墙的一部分
A piece of the wall.

64
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,570
来  往后退
Come on. Back.

65
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,320
威尔斯  我是肖
Wells, it's Shaw.

66
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,280
能收到吗  完毕
Do you copy? Over.

67
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,330
我要去找他
I'm going after him.

68
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,600
没必要
There's no point.

69
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,850
他已经死了
He's already dead.

70
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,810
不  我见过他一次杀死几十只腐尸
No, I've seen him kill dozens of rotters at a time.

71
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,660
杀死他的不是它们
Oh, they didn't kill him.

72
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,910
而是她
She did.

73
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,250
我的敌人
My enemy.

74
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,740
你的确卷土重来了
So you did come back.

75
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,160
你认为那个女人在外面
You thought that woman was out there...

76
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,510
结果还派保罗出去
and you sent Paul in?

77
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,900
他是诱饵吗
What was he -- bait?

78
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,350
他是战士
He was a soldier.

79
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,740
战士有时候会阵亡
Soldiers sometimes fall.

80
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,570
不  他不只是战士
No. He was more than that.

81
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,470
他还是家人
He was family.

82
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,520
是啊
Yes.

83
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,690
上帝决定了他的命运
Whose fate God decided.

84
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,670
不是上帝派他出去的
God didn't send him out there.

85
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,500
是你
You did.

86
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,590
你不同意我的决定吗  肖
A decision you disagree with, Shaw?

87
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,980
你最近话很多啊
You have had a hell of a lot to say,

88
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,500
自从你男友出现后
ever since your boyfriend showed up.

89
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,440
你还想分享什么吗
Anything else you wanna share?

90
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,520
没了  长官
No, sir.

91
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,880
威尔斯也许是你的兄弟
Wells may have been your brother...

92
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,730
但他更像是我的儿子
but he was a son to me.

93
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,880
因为他的勇气
Because of his courage...

94
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,290
我们知道了敌人就在附近
we now know the enemy is close!

95
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,400
我跟你们保证  他们这次绝对插翅难飞
And I promise you, they will not escape this time.

96
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,450
暴风雨刮掉了花园旁边墙上的一块嵌板
The storm blew down one of the panels in the wall over by the gardens.

97
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,420
但愿只有这一块
Hopefully it's just the one.

98
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,430
更糟糕的是  风车起火了
Now, what's worse, there's a fire in the windmill

99
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,840
火光吸引了附近的行尸
that's drawing the walkers from the surrounding areas.

100
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,940
我们得把嵌板修好  把火扑灭
We have to get that panel back up and the fire out.

101
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,730
是的  我们需要三支小队
Yeah, so we're gonna need three teams.

102
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,320
我带一队人去灭火
I'll take one to fight the fire.

103
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,460
我带一队人去修墙
And I'll take a crew to repair the wall.

104
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,800
我们还需要一队人  保护这里的人
We're gonna need another team to protect everyone in here.

105
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,030
我可以
And I can handle that.

106
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,210
很好
Okay. Good.

107
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,750
有志愿者吗
So...volunteers?

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,070
我愿意去

109
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,890
不  你刚回来
No. You just got back.

110
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,780
我没事

111
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,580
我要去

112
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,100
如果她想去  我们也需要帮手
If she's up for it, we could use the help.
我要去

113
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
如果她想去  我们也需要帮手
If she's up for it, we could use the help.

114
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,920
我想和卡萝尔一起去

115
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,650
她想和卡萝尔一起去
She wants to go with Carol.

116
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,890
谢谢
Thank you.

117
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,590
那我也跟你们去
Well, then, I'm joining, too.

118
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,600
没得商量  姐姐
It's not up for discussion, sis.

119
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,900
我跟你一起去
I'll go with you.

120
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,460
我也是
So will I.

121
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,490
维吉尔  你站都站不稳
Virgil, you can barely stand.

122
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,830
我想帮忙
I'd like to help.

123
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,860
我在屋内需要尽可能多的人手
I can use all the help I can get here

124
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,480
以确保行尸进不来
and make sure nothing gets in.

125
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,920
好吧  我留下
Yeah. Okay. I'll stay here.

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,460
好  行动吧
Alright. Let's move.

127
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,530
我也可以跟你一起去
I can go with you, too.

128
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,600
谢谢你  朱迪思  但我更希望你留在这里
Oh, thank you, Judith, but I'd prefer it if you stayed here.

129
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,280
-我不怕  -我知道
- I'm not scared. - No, I know you're not,

130
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,130
但我希望你能帮助其他孩子
but I was really hoping maybe you could help

131
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,770
让他们没那么害怕
the other kids feel a little less afraid.

132
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,130
你能帮我吗
Can you do that for me?

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,890
很好
Good.

134
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,540
我很快就回来  亲爱的
I'll be back in a little while, sweetie.

135
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,420
你听罗西塔的话  好吗
You do whatever Rosita tells you, okay?

136
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,180
你就不能留下来  让别人去吗
Why can't you stay and have somebody else go?

137
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,750
己所不欲
Because it wouldn't be fair of me to ask someone

138
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,900
勿施于人  明白吗
to do something I wouldn't do myself. Understand?

139
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,410
我可以陪着你
I can stay with you.

140
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,680
谢谢
Thank you.

141
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,190
出发吧
Let's move.

142
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,970
腐尸走了
Rotters are gone.

143
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,430
但她还在
But she's not.

144
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,620
你跟她同行了多久
How long did you travel with her for?

145
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,730
不太久
Not long at all.

146
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,460
关于她  你能告诉我些什么
What can you tell me about her?

147
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,990
没什么
Not -- Not much.

148
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,180
那我为什么要留下你
Why am I keeping you around?

149
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,490
你说过是上帝选了我
You said God chose me.

150
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,910
迪克森
Oh, Dixon.

151
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,550
我以前养过一条狗
I had this dog.

152
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,150
它叫泰克  因为它是布鲁泰克犬
Named Tick, on account he was a Bluetick hound.

153
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,130
我在路边看到了它
Found him on the side of the road.

154
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,440
它饿得半死
He was starving, half-dead.

155
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,750
但是像泰克这样的流浪狗
But the thing with some of these rescues like Tick,

156
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,550
它们不轻信人
they don't trust easy.

157
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,030
有时候  我伸手去摸泰克
Now, sometimes, I would reach for Tick,

158
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,120
它会这样看着我
and he'd give me this look.

159
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,520
就跟你一样
That look.

160
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,450
就好像它无法决定  是要舔我的手
Like he couldn't decide whether to lick my hand

161
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,010
还是咬掉我的手
or bite it off.

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,910
别担心
Don't worry.

163
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,790
我不会舔你的
I ain't gonna lick ya.

164
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,440
真厉害
There he is!

165
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,140
行吧
Fair enough.

166
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,520
尽量也别咬我
Just don't try to bite me, either.

167
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,020
泰克就咬了
Tick did.

168
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,300
勒死那条狗时我真是心疼死了
Hurt like hell having to strangle that dog.

169
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,110
我们留下他  因为他是个出色的追踪者
We kept him here 'cause he's an excellent tracker.

170
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,740
他肯定注意到了点什么
I'm sure he noticed something.

171
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,670
她准头很准
She's -- She's a great shot.

172
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,880
我知道这点
I know that.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,840
她也许就是这样干掉威尔斯的
That's probably how she took out Wells.

174
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,250
那你会去哪里找她
So, where would you look for her?

175
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,010
她肯定想提防我们的动向
Well, she's gonna want to see us coming.

176
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,470
她是用弓的  所以我会注意上方
She's got that bow, so I'd look up.

177
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,030
也许是在树上
In the trees maybe.

178
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,710
-树上  -对
- Trees? - Yeah.

179
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,360
看看吧
We'll see.

180
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,910
长官  它们又回来了
Sir, they're back.

181
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,780
怎么了
What is it?

182
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,910
不知以什么方式  她能用死人对付活人了
Somehow, she has turned the dead against the living.

183
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,250
真令人刮目相看
Ooh, that's impressive.

184
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,780
大门有多坚固
How strong is this gate?

185
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,340
足够坚固
Oh, it's strong enough.

186
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,510
但它们走不了这么远的
They won't get that far, though.

187
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,340
我们得再找些木板
We need more boards.

188
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,720
用家具  亚伦会理解的
Use the furniture. Aaron will understand.

189
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,280
我来帮忙
I'll help.

190
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,640
我真希望我能像你一样
I wish I was more like you.

191
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,040
你从来都不会害怕
You're never afraid.

192
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,410
才不是呢
That's not true.

193
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,740
我好几次都吓坏了
I've been scared plenty of times.

194
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,430
表面上都看不出来
It never seems that way.

195
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,510
那是因为我学会了如何利用恐惧
That's 'cause I've learned how to use my fear.

196
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,710
-利用  -是的
- Use it? - Yeah.

197
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,300
你也可以的
You can, too.

198
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,910
我妈妈教我的
My mom taught me.

199
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,750
就好像你害怕的时候能跑得更快
Just like how you can run faster when you're scared,

200
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,340
也能战斗得更好
you can fight better, too.

201
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,030
恐惧能让你变强
It makes you stronger.

202
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,720
她会很为你骄傲的
She'd be proud of you.

203
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,720
你知道她去了哪里吗
Do you know where she went?

204
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,480
不知道  抱歉
I don't. I'm sorry.

205
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,050
我好久没听到她的消息了
I haven't heard from her in so long.

206
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,980
真希望她在这里
I just wish she was here.

207
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,740
她在
She is.

208
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,660
我从你握剑的方式上看到了她的影子
I see her in the way you hold your sword.

209
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,240
还有你准备冲进暴风雨中的架势...
The way you're ready to run into the storm...

210
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,300
以及你和那些孩子说话
and how you talk to those kids,

211
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,600
教他们相信自己的样子
helping them believe in themselves.

212
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,520
你妈妈和你在一起呢
Your mama's still with you.

213
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,900
而且毫无疑问
And you can bet

214
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,620
无论她现在在哪里  你都和她在一起
that wherever she is, you're with her.

215
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,500
格雷西  小心点
Gracie, be careful!

216
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,490
杀了它  杀了它
Get 'em! Get 'em!

217
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,070
外面都是行尸
They're all over out there.

218
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,520
联系卡萝尔  告诉她肯定还有别的缺口
Radio Carol, tell her there must be another breach.

219
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,790
就在房子附近  快去
A close one. Go!

220
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,050
朱迪思  把蜡烛灭了  快去
Judith. Candles, now.

221
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,690
你在想什么呢  肖
What's on your mind, Shaw?

222
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,410
-没什么  -说吧
- Nothing. - Come on.

223
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,650
我比了解自己还要了解你
I know you better than I know myself.

224
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,990
怎么了
What?

225
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,930
我在想我们牺牲的那些人
I'm thinking of the ones we've lost.

226
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,960
而你在怪我
And you blame me.

227
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,650
我没这么说
I didn't say that.

228
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,170
"我不肯用白得之物作燔祭
"Will not offer to the Lord my God

229
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,090
献给耶和华我的神"
burnt offerings that cost me nothing."

230
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,380
这些都是磨难  莉娅
These are all tribulations, Leah.

231
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,100
饥荒那匹黑马  对我们所有人穷追不舍
The black horse of famine, it rides after us all.

232
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,060
我早就知道这场战争将要到来
I knew this war was coming.

233
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,930
而在每场战争中  必然都会有...牺牲
And in every war, there is...sacrifice.

234
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,610
因此我们一开始才会被选中
That's why we were chosen in the first place,

235
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,460
因为我们没有逃避战火
'cause we didn't run from the fire.

236
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,540
就像我们不会逃避我们的敌人
Just like we don't run from our enemies.

237
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,280
那些牺牲了的人...
Those men that have died...

238
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,930
他们并不是白白牺牲
they didn't die in vain.

239
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,060
正是他们的牺牲证明了我们仍然值得
It's their sacrifice that shows we are still worthy.

240
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,570
因此  我们必将取胜
That's why we will prevail.

241
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,730
兄弟  你可错过烟花秀了
Man, you're missing all the fireworks!

242
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,660
迪克森  你怎么上来了
Dixon. What are you doing up here?

243
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,030
教皇让我绕墙转转
Pope told me to walk the perimeter, so...

244
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,880
我这正在转呢
I'm walking the perimeter.

245
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,670
抽烟吗
You want a smoke?

246
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,440
好啊
Yeah.

247
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,400
给
There you go, man.

248
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,020
曾经戒过一次
Quit these once.

249
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,080
看来我得再戒一次了
Guess I'll have to quit them again.

250
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,070
何苦呢
Why?

251
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,540
来
Alright.

252
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,940
给
Here you go.

253
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,750
北门没问题
We're holding good at the northern gate.

254
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,300
围墙很坚固
Walls are holding strong.

255
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,190
那边  快去
Around that way. Go.

256
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,390
你刚刚去哪了
Where were you?

257
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,490
想着做好准备
Just wanted to be ready.

258
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,060
你用不到那些的
Well, you're not gonna need them.

259
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,340
腐尸开始散去了
The rotters are scattering.

260
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,230
你确定吗
You sure about that?

261
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,570
我的敌人从不会放弃
My enemy never gives up.

262
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,050
守好大门
Secure the gate.

263
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,910
肖
Shaw.

264
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,870
备好火厢车
Ready the hwacha.

265
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,890
那是什么
What's that?

266
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,860
终结一切的手段
It's how we're going to end this.

267
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,700
那是什么气味
What is that smell?

268
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,730
烂到没法吃或用的东西
Anything too rotten to eat or use.

269
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,650
所以才没人来这里
That's why there's nobody out here.

270
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,720
你记得该去哪里吗
You remember where you're going?

271
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,850
顶层  第二个房间
Top floor, second room,

272
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,590
大楼西南角
southwest corner of the building.

273
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,590
记得等我的信号
Just remember to wait for my signal.

274
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,390
了解
Got it.

275
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,520
我们做完这事  就拿食物回家
We do this, then we get the food, and we go home.

276
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,230
合页快坏了
Oh, the hinges are coming apart!

277
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,630
门框也是
And the frame.

278
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:44,960
天啊
Geez.

279
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,160
你在做什么
What are you doing?

280
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,400
争取时间
I'm buying us time.

281
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,640
什么
What?

282
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,300
-我能做什么  -我出去后关上门
- What can I do? - Close the door behind me.

283
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,800
别打开  好了  听我数
Keep it closed. Alright. On my count.

284
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,980
一
One...

285
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,780
二
two...

286
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,090
三
...three!

287
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,230
离窗户远点
Let's stay away from the windows.

288
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,550
-好了吗  -好了  拉
- Ready? - Ready. Go.

289
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,490
-这是你造的吗  -对
- You built this? - Yep.

290
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,440
安切塔以前是工兵
Ancheta was a combat engineer.

291
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,200
现在他是我们的大发明家
Now's he's our DaVinci, right?

292
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,430
这辆火厢车能迅速干掉那群腐尸
This hwacha will make short work of those rotters.

293
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,770
我们收掉漏网之鱼就行
We can mop up everything else.

294
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,150
准备好以后告诉我
Let me know when you're ready.

295
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,050
好
Alright.

296
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,620
威尔斯的事我很遗憾
Sorry about Wells.

297
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
我不该让他一个人出去的
I shouldn't have let him out there by himself.

298
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,120
-这不怪你  -这是我的责任
- That wasn't on you. - It was my responsibility.

299
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,490
我应该保护他  就像他一直保护我一样
I should've had his back, like he's always had mine.

300
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,940
我的人  我们守护彼此
My people, we protect each other.

301
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,110
至少以前是如此
At least we used to.

302
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,140
我能问你件事吗
Can I ask you something?

303
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,600
怎么了
What?

304
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,070
教皇说  上帝选中了我们
Pope says... God chose us.

305
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,310
你信这话吗
You believe all that?

306
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,520
为什么问
Why?

307
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,060
随便问问
Just asking.

308
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,730
我知道这听起来有多荒谬
Look. I know how it sounds.

309
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,300
但在我们一无所有时  他给了我们一个信仰
But when we had nothing, he gave us something to hold onto.

310
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,130
因为相信了他  我们才能活下来
We're all alive 'cause we believed in him.

311
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,360
那现在呢
What about now?

312
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,030
我信不信不重要
Doesn't matter whether I believe or not.

313
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,930
对我来说很重要
Well, it matters to me.

314
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,650
你有没有想过  如果我们
You ever think about what it'd be like

315
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,230
没离开那个小屋会是什么样
if we'd never left that cabin?

316
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,270
嗯
Yeah.

317
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,310
我想过
Yeah, I do.

318
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,130
看着你在乎的东西变了
It's hard to watch something you care about change...

319
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,320
同时在伤害你在乎的其他人很难受
when they're hurting other people you care about, too.

320
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,950
是啊
It is.

321
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,270
达里尔
Daryl...

322
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,120
火厢车情况如何
What's the status of the hwacha?

323
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,950
准备就绪  随时待命
We're ready and standing by.

324
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,470
好  莉娅  该动手了
Okay, Leah. It's time to do this.

325
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,960
我来了
I'm on my way.

326
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,390
等等  莉娅
Wait, Leah.

327
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,620
我必须告诉你一件事
I have to tell you something.

328
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,050
什么事
What?

329
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,270
下面有人在和行尸同行
There's people down there walking with the dead.

330
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,010
-我的人  -什么
- My people. - What?

331
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,300
他们是来拿教皇抢走的食物的
They're here for the food that Pope took from them.

332
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,070
没食物他们会饿死  他们都是好人
They'll starve without it, and they're good people.

333
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,130
他们有家人
They got families.

334
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,360
他们不知道将会遭遇什么  拜托了
They don't know what's about to happen to them. Please.

335
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,240
你不能让他们像这样死去
You can't let them die like this.

336
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,990
你骗了我
You lied to me.

337
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,210
为了保护我的家人
To protect my family.

338
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,690
我相信你能理解的
I'm sure you can understand that.

339
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,090
卡弗让我别相信你
Carver told me not to trust you.

340
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,290
但我想相信你
But I wanted to.

341
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,570
非常想
So badly.

342
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,170
当我看到你与他们为伍时
I didn't think I could trust you either

343
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,680
我也曾以为不能相信你了
when I saw who you were with.

344
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,940
如果教皇知道你和她是一伙
What do you think Pope is gonna do

345
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,560
你觉得他会怎么做
when he finds out you're with her?

346
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,930
他不必知道
He doesn't have to know.

347
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,920
你可以跟我走
You could come with me.

348
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,730
但你必须帮我阻止他  拜托你一定要帮我
Just please let me stop him. Please. You gotta help me.

349
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,410
我们的敌人该遭到报应了
It is time for our enemy to face their reckoning!

350
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,210
老天
Oh, my.

351
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,130
你俩刚在聊什么呢
What were you two talking about?

352
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,310
家人
Family.

353
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,450
家人确实最重要
Ain't nothing more important.

354
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,960
这是这个世界上
The only real thing that...

355
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,350
唯一真实的东西了
we got left in this world.

356
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,750
你同意吗  迪克森
Would you agree, Dixon?

357
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,070
嗯  我同意
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

358
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,220
结束以后
When this is done...

359
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,630
我要你去给我找到那个女人
I want you to find that woman for me.

360
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,540
把她带给我  迪克森
Bring her to me, Dixon.

361
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,220
好样的
Good man.

362
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,340
迪弗  门上的铁链什么情况
Deaver, what's the status on the chain on that gate?

363
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,430
我正在去车库
Heading to the garage now.

364
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,920
不  过来  不
No! Hey! Come here! No!

365
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,620
不
No!

366
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,720
卡弗  下面发生了什么
Carver, what the hell's going on down there?

367
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,100
是敌人  他们在墙内
It's the enemy. They're inside the walls.

368
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,840
瞄准庭院开火
Aim into the courtyard and fire.

369
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,840
-长官  -你没听错
- Sir? - You heard me.

370
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,380
快点
Now!

371
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,600
我们的人还在下面
Our people are out there.

372
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,950
我知道
I am aware of that.

373
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,320
那就叫他们回来
So let's call them back in.

374
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,690
然后惊动敌人吗  不
Alert the enemy? No.

375
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,050
上帝会保护他们
God will protect them!

376
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,590
如果祂没保护呢
And what if he doesn't?

377
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,190
那说明他们命数已尽
Then it was their time to die.

378
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,140
教皇  我们能用别的方法打赢
Pope. We can win this another way.

379
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,580
我们要用...我们自己的方法赢下来
We will win this... ourway.

380
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,170
-你不能杀...  -我能
- You can't kill --  - I can.

381
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,480
我能
I can!

382
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,850
上帝通过我传达意志
The Lord speaks through me!

383
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,610
不准质疑上帝  不准质疑我
You don't question the Lord! You don't question me!

384
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,560
点火
Light it up!

385
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,520
有人开枪
Shots fired!

386
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,610
莉娅  走吧  在他们发现我们之前
Leah. Come on. Before they find us.

387
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,640
教皇死了
Pope is dead.

388
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,210
迪克森杀了他
Dixon murdered him.

389
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,630
他和敌人是一伙的
He's with the enemy.

390
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,310
肖  再说一遍
Shaw, repeat!

391
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,810
教皇死了吗
Pope is dead?!

392
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,000
莉娅  能收到吗
Leah! Do you copy?

393
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,930
我们这就来
We're on our way.

394
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,840
你为什么要这样做
Why would you do that?

395
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,340
他忘记了什么最重要
He forgot about what mattered.

396
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,040
不是战争
Not war.

397
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,340
而是人
People.

398
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,130
我的人
My people.

399
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,620
你为了保护家人愿意做任何事
You'd do anything to protect your family.

400
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,840
我也是
So would I.

401
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,120
莉娅
Leah!

402
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,610
我有机会的时候就该杀了他
Should've killed him when I had the chance.

403
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,170
去关上大门
Go get the gate closed.

404
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,760
然后呢
Then what?

405
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,440
然后杀光墙里的一切东西
Then we're gonna kill everything inside these walls.

406
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,040
挡不了多久了
This isn't gonna hold them for long.

407
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,660
太多了杀不完
There's too many to fight off!

408
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,600
需要我呼叫亚伦和卡萝尔吗
Do I need to radio Aaron and Carol?

409
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,280
不  他们还得灭火和补墙
No. They need to put out that fire and close those breaches.

410
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,370
我们让大家都上楼
If we get everyone upstairs,

411
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,150
能把它们拦在一楼吧
we can hold them off to the first floor, right?

412
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,370
-能吧  -嗯
- Right? - Yeah.

413
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,010
大家全上楼  现在就去
Everyone! Upstairs, now! Go!

414
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,950
跟赫谢尔一起去  小瑞
Go with Hershel, RJ.

415
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,110
不不不  别担心我
No, no, no. Don't worry about me.

416
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,480
你先上楼
You go and get up those steps.

417
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,140
我和你一起上
I will. With you.

418
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,750
-我去帮他  好吗  -好
- I'll get him. Okay? - Yeah.

419
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,660
-可以吗  -我顶着
- Ready? - I got it.

420
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,130
我来扶他吧  朱迪思
I'll take him from here, Judith.

421
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,260
靠我身上
Just lean on me.

422
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,030
格雷西
Gracie?!

423
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,400
格雷西
Gracie?!

424
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,870
朱迪思
Judith!

425
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,170
格雷西
Gracie?

426
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,740
我在下面
I'm down here.

427
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,290
朱迪思
Judith!

428
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,970
-我顶着  你去抱可可  快去  -什么
- I got this, okay? You go get Coco. Go! Go! - What?

429
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,430
你在做什么
What are you doing?

430
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,410
