492
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,574
So how'd the wine go over?

493
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,369
Great. It was a good first step.

494
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,955
What's next?

495
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,124
I'm glad you asked.

496
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,460
Murphy, you're on the door.

497
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,713
Cass, Lewis, split the wait staff.

498
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,049
Figure out how he gained access.
Did he have help?

499
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,426
I want answers.

500
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,636
Espinosa.

501
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,265
-Your friend on the wait staff...
-Yeah?

502
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,391
See if she knows anything.

503
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,559
Yes, sir.

504
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,981
So did you work with him long?

505
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,774
No, we never even met.

506
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,444
Really? It's such a small crew in here.

507
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,363
You think I'm lying?

508
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,949
I'm just trying to figure out
what happened.

509
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,745
I think it's pretty clear.
Didn't you hear what he said?

510
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,414
Yeah, that there were others.

511
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,458
What do you think he meant by that?

512
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,667
No idea.

513
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,170
But for what it's worth,
I believe him.

514
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,257
This place is like a city from before.

515
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,096
You remember.

516
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,724
Yeah, I do.

517
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,022
But you're doing this?

518
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,489
So you don't know how he got in?

519
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,656
Nope.

520
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,158
Great.

521
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,749
I wasn't expecting you.

522
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,043
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

523
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,711
Come in.

524
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,880
Thanks.

525
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,596
Oh.

526
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,809
Vintage.

527
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,062
Yes, I am a lady of high caliber.

528
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,857
The highest.

529
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,697
Wasn't that something today?

530
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,449
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

531
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,412
They really know how to throw
a party around here, don't they?

532
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,538
Kids had a blast.

533
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,750
Yeah.

534
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,752
He would've loved it.

535
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,049
Yep.

536
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:36,100
I know that this was
too painful before,

537
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,689
but this belongs to you.

538
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,037
-You should keep it.
-No, no, no.

539
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,667
I want you to have it.

540
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,180
This place can be a fresh start,

541
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,600
if you want it to be.

542
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,689
How are you, really?

543
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,567
Just great.

544
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,362
Still finding reasons to smile.

545
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,329
Well, then...

546
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,964
To fresh starts.

547
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,515
(CHUCKLES)

548
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,559
-It's not bad.
-No.

549
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,685
It's not bad at all.

550
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,107
You always took the big glass.

551

00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,041
You look awesome.

554
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,377
Thanks.

555
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,755
And you look official.

556
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,883
Yeah? You think so?

557
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,263
Hmm.

558
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,473
I don't feel official.

559
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,558
(SNICKERS)

560
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,268
Hey, I got you something.

561
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,316
Yes!

562
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,153
Hmm.
