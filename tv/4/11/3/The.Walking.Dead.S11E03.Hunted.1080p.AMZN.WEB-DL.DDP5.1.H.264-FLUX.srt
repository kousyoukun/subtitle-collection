00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,120
{\an8}行尸走肉

5
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,100
{\an8}第十一季  第三集


14
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,480
《行尸走肉》前情提要
Previously on "The Walking Dead"...

15
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,060
我们刚收留了两个新社区的人
We just took in two new communities.

16
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,500
我们没有庄稼和存粮
We have no crops, no back stock.

17
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,430
上一批大尸群把所有的动物都吓跑了
The last big horde scared all the animals away.

18
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,860
我们可以去找新猎场
We can find new territory.

19
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,750
我们没时间  我们需要食物  
We don't have time. We need food. 

20
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,340
大量食物  现在就要
Lots of it. Now.

21
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,530
关于攻击我们的人
The people that attacked us --

22
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,410
我们只知道两点
we only knew two things about them.

23
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,840
他们晚上行动
They come at night.

24
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,510
等你看到他们  你就已经是死人了
And by the time you see them, you're already dead.

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,690
快跑
Run!

26
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,050
狗
Dog!

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,850
伊莱哲
Elijah!

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,340
不
No!

29
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,220
30分钟后见
See you in 30.

30
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,610
小凯  小凯  小凯
Kel. Kel, Kel.

31
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,450
今早我没见到你
I missed you this morning.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,030
我们不是一起轮班吗
Thought we had a shift together.

33
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,800
抱歉  我有点事
Sorry. Something came up.

34
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,120
你还想跟我一起轮班吗
You still want to do those shifts with me?

35
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,460
如果不想  也没关系
It's okay if you don't.

36
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,680
下次一定  我保证
Next one. I promise.

37
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,860
小凯
Kel.

38
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,050
你
Do you...

39
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,020
你想谈谈吗
Do you wanna talk about it?

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,290
没什么好谈的
Nothing to talk about.

41
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,460
大家一起  拉
Come on. Everyone -- pull!

42
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,150
你要出门吗
Hey. Going somewhere?

43
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,380
我们得找回马
We need to get our horses back.

44
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,650
你进来时看见东墙了吗
You see the east wall when you came in?

45
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,500
看见了
I did.

46
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,210
你今天该帮忙的
You were marked down to help today.

47
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,190
你似乎已经有一队人了
Looks like you've got a crew already.

48
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,880
你一早都不见人影
Well, you were gone all morning.

49
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,190
我们就先开工了
We started without you.

50
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,630
对不起  亚伦  我今天没法帮你
I'm sorry, Aaron. I can't today.

51
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,110
因为你在追踪一群
Because you're tracking horses

52
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,240
几乎没希望抓到的马吗
that you have almost no hope of catching?

53
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,090
达里尔和我之前也这样做过
You know, Daryl and I went down that road before.

54
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
最后也没抓到巴顿斯
Didn't work out so well for Buttons.

55
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,000
我们的口粮快没了
We're almost out of MREs,

56
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,770
庄稼地就是个笑话
and the fields are a joke --

57
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,560
我们的墙要不行了
And our walls are about to fail.

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
如果我们找不到马
Well, if we don't get those horses,

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,310
我们就没法搬运比一袋粮食
we're not gonna be able to move anything heavier

60
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,780
更重的东西
than a sack of grain.

61
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,390
也没法去远方搜刮物资
Or go out far enough to scavenge anything,

62
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,070
我们都会饿死的
and we're all gonna starve to death.

63
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,270
我几小时后回来
So I'll be back in a few hours.

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,760
我也很饿
I'm hungry, too.

65
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,200
你妈妈出去时  你会担心吗
Do you ever worry about your mom when she goes away?

66
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,420
我都习惯了
I'm used to it.

67
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,520
大人总是会出去办事
Grown-ups are always running off doing things.

68
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,010
"我保证会很快回来
"Promise I'll see you soon.

69
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,350
爱你哦"
Love you."

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,570
在旧时代他们常说那种话  对吗
They used to say that kind of stuff in the olden times, right?

71
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,640
他们现在没法保证  但还是这样说
They can't promise it now, but they say it anyways.

72
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,360
他们不希望我们认为他们再也回不来了
They don't want us to think they're never coming back.

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,930
那些话是为了让我们好受些
It's supposed to make us feel better.

74
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,070
他们是为了让自己好受些
They say it to make themselvesfeel better.

75
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,800
不管怎样
Still...

76
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,420
我妈妈总是会回来
my mom always comes back.

77
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,170
是啊
Yeah.

78
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,960
可恶
Dang it.

79
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,620
上帝  你是我的避难所  我的力量源泉
Lord, you are my refuge and my strength...

80
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,610
我的避难所  我的力量源泉
My refuge and my strength...

81
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,860
我的避难所
My refuge...

82
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
奥尔登
Alden.

83
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,070
玛姬
Maggie.

84
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,060
天啊
Jesus.

85
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,710
让我看看
Let me see?

86
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,190
行  老大
Sure thing, boss.

87
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,250
这么惨吗
That good, huh?

88
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,780
你可以走路吗
You think you can walk?

89
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,830
试试才知道
Not gonna know until we try. 

90
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,330
你不会真觉得我们要继续前进吧
You're not seriously thinking that we keep going.

91
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,830
他们会再来的  我们得继续前进
They'll be back. We gotta keep moving.

92
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,410
好吧  等等  现在的计划到底是什么
Alright, wait. What exactly is the plan here?

93
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,520
计划不变
The plan doesn't change.

94
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,690
我们需要那些食物
We need that food.

95
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,810
我们去无线电塔  找到补给屋
We get to the radio tower, find the supply house,

96
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,170
然后等待其他人
and wait for the others.

97
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,130
如果其他人死了呢
And what if the others are dead?

98
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,690
我了解戏剧效果
Listen, I know theatrics.

99
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,050
那些人刚告诉了我们
Those people, they just told us

100
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,890
他们到底有多疯狂
exactly how insane they are.

101
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,590
我们不能走大路
We can't be on a road.

102
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,390
我们不能走任何他们可能走的路
We can't be on any road that they could use.

103
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,500
这是个糟糕的计划
It's a shit plan.

104
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,520
那你告诉我一个更好的
Then you tell me a better one

105
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,220
不会让我们所有人饿死的计划
that doesn't starve us all.

106
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,910
我就知道
Right.

107
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,900
我是站在你这边的  玛姬
I am on your side, Maggie.

108
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
那就帮我带他走
Then help me with him.

109
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,890
二  三  起
2, 3, go.

110
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,690
不行
No.

111
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,100
除非你想让可可神魂颠倒
Not unless you want Coco tripping the light fantastic.

112
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,300
但最多只会持续一周  对吧
Yeah, but just for like a week, tops, right?

113
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,190
-你没事吧  -没事
- You good? - Yeah.

114
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,700
只是加百利在执行任务
Yeah, it's just that Gabriel's on a mission,

115
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,550
而我被困在家里
and I'm over being stuck in the house.

116
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
怎么了  你们在做什么
Why? What're you guys doing?

117
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,170
等等
Wait.

118
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,550
该死
Damn it!

119
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,120
第四次准有好运气
Fourth time's the charm.

120
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,400
我们继续吧
Let's get a move on.

121
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,570
你没事吧
You okay?

122
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,340
等抓到马就没事了
I'll be better when this is done.

123
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,480
我最近一直在做关于亚伯拉罕的梦
I've been having dreams about Abraham recently.

124
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,630
是吗
Yeah?

125
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,670
是的  他想告诉我某件事
Yeah, he's trying to tell me something.

126
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,750
我知道那是重要的事  我应该做的事
I know it's something important, something I'm supposed to do.

127
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,680
但大部分时候我都听不见他
But I can't hear him most of the time,

128
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,110
就当我快听见时
and just when I'm about to...

129
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,050
他就被爆头了
he, um -- he gets shot in the head.

130
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,520
真阴暗
Well, that's dark.

131
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,870
是啊  我不知道我为什么告诉你
Yeah, I don't know why I just told you that.

132
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,650
不  我懂的
No, I get it.

133
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,830
以前这会让我恐慌
It used to freak me out,

134
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,700
但现在我觉得这是一条给我们和亚历山大的信息
but now I think it's a message for us, for Alexandria.

135
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,510
你觉得他想说什么
What do you think he's trying to say?

136
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,970
我不知道
I don't know.

137
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,150
如果马让你摸它的耳朵
You know, if a horse lets you touch its ear,

138
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,570
就代表它信任你
it means it trusts you.

139
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,600
我读到过
I read that once.

140
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,050
你认为我们能把它们抓回来吗
You think we'll get them back?

141
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,080
马是野性的动物
Horses are wild creatures.

142
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,730
很难说
You never know.

143
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,330
有两英里  比我想的要更远
It's 2 miles. It's further than I thought.

144
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,960
那就快走吧
We better get moving.

145
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,070
牵着你的手并不会帮我走快一点
Holding your hand's not gonna help me walk any faster.

146
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,160
是吗  那想到那些行尸会撕下你的脸
Yeah? Does the thought of one of those things

147
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,210
能帮你走快点吗
ripping your face off do it for you?

148
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,370
如果你害怕  为什么
If you're scared, why don't you

149
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,270
不发挥下作用  去杀死它们
make yourself useful and go kill 'em?

150
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,010
真的吗  我们要朝着尖叫声走吗
Really? So we're just gonna go towards the screaming?

151
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,570
行吧
Cool.

152
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,580
阿加莎
Agatha!

153
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,670
玛姬  邓肯出事了
Maggie. It's Duncan.

154
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,080
邓肯
Duncan.

155
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,630
邓肯
Duncan.

156
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,680
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

157
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,090
为所有事
For all of it.

158
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,100
为什么
Why?

159
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,870
我们之前过得很好
We were good.

160
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,080
我们很幸运
We were lucky.

161
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,170
持续了一小段时间
For a little while.

162
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,440
确保她平安回家
Make sure she gets home.

163
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,200
答应我
Promise.

164
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,200
这边走
This way.

165
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,300
不
No.

166
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,300
不
No.

167
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,940
不可能
It can't be.

168
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,690
没事的
It's okay.

169
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,210
我们继续找其它的马
We'll keep looking for the rest.

170
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,150
它们会待在水源附近
They'll stay close to the water.

171
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,250
如果到处是尸体它们就不会了
Not if it's full of corpses they won't.

172
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,790
卡萝尔  天色晚了
Carol, it's getting late.

173
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,940
她说得对
She's right.

174
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,220
我们没必要现在去找
We don't have to do this right now.

175
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,460
我们明天再回来
Let's come back tomorrow.

176
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,790
不  亚历山大昨天就需要这些马
No, Alexandria needed these horses yesterday.

177
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,840
卡萝尔
Carol...

178
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,670
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

179
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,940
我们再试试
We'll try again.

180
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,660
下一次
Next time.

181
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,420
也许不用了
Maybe not.

182
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,900
真酷
Dope.

183
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,640
它们直奔奶牛场了
They're headed towards the dairy farm.

184
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,080
-所以呢  -奶牛场有围场
- And? - The dairy farm's got paddocks.

185
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,410
我们可以把马关进去
We can pen them in.

186
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,820
快  我们走吧
Come on. Let's go.

187
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,650
别紧张  别紧张
Easy now. Easy now.

188
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,810
放下套索
Drop the lassos.

189
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,550
为什么
Why?

190
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,010
照做就是
Just do it.

191
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,400
它们没跑
They're not running.

192
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,260
我觉得它们想回家了
I think they want to come home.

193
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,080
我虽然行过死荫的幽谷
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

194
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:47,970
{\an9}{\pos(377,200)}出自《旧约-诗篇 23:4》

195
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,780
也不怕遭害  因为你与我同在
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

196
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,230
我虽然行过死荫的幽谷
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

197
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,070
也不怕遭害  因为你与我同在
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

198
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,100
你比我预想得来得更慢
You move slower than I thought you would.

199
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,290
别害怕
Don't be scared.

200
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,680
我不怕
I'm not.

201
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,130
我们受到了保佑
We have been blessed.

202
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,140
我
I...

203
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,720
我受到了保佑
I have been blessed.

204
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,390
你对保佑的定义真有趣
You have a funny definition of blessed.

205
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,990
但来取我命的人是你
But it is you who has come for me.

206
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,440
你会为我祷告吗
Will you pray for me?

207
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,500
你想杀掉我的朋友们
You tried to kill my friends.

208
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,650
是的
Yes.

209
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,800
他们也想杀掉我
And they tried to kill me.

210
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,020
为我祷告
Pray for me.

211
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,480
即便是你的敌人也应如此
Even your enemies deserve that much.

212
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,880
我以为你是信奉上帝的人
I thought you were a man of God.

213
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,160
上帝已经不在了
God isn't here anymore.

214
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,050
是之前的两倍多
Twice as many as before.

215
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,050
我们得重新考虑下你的计划  玛姬
We need to rethink your plan, Maggie.

216
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,080
你是自由的  尼根  你想走吗
You're a free man, Negan. You wanna go?

217
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,320
走吧
Go.

218
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,590
我能帮你
I can help you.

219
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,430
你知道的  你的朋友们  他们信任我
You know, your friends, they trusted me.

220
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,150
你离开了很长时间
You were gone for a long time.

221
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,890
事情会变  人会变
Things change. People change.

222
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,320
不
No.

223
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,480
也许你骗过了他们  但没骗过我
Maybe you've got them fooled, but not me.

224
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,840
不要再装作你是我们的一员了  尼根
Stop pretending you're one of us, Negan.

225
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,460
你可能连自己都信了
Maybe you even believe it.

226
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,630
但也许你不仅擅长骗别人
But you're probably as good at lying to yourself

227
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,170
也一样擅长骗自己
as you are to everybody else.

228
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,460
你没事吧  玛姬
You okay, Maggie?

229
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,040
没事
Yeah.

230
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,130
我能处理好尼根
I can handle Negan.

231
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,150
我说的不是尼根
I wasn't talking about Negan.

232
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,060
这应该不是你想象中回家后的情形
This can't be what you thought you'd be coming home to.

233
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,370
应该也不是你告诉赫谢尔他会看到的样子
It can't be what you told Hershel he'd see.

234
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,560
你知道的  没有什么事情能让我再惊讶了
You know, not much surprises me anymore.

235
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,610
除了山顶寨
Except Hilltop.

236
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,790
我和赫谢尔讲的不是那样的地方
It's not the place I told Hershel about.

237
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
等等
Hold on a sec.

238
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,310
我也不知道还有什么事情会让他惊讶
You know, I'm not sure much surprises him anymore, either.

239
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,960
你会把它重新建起来的
You'll build it back up,

240
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,570
比以前更好
better than it was before.

241
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,040
我们会的
We will.

242
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,420
好的
Sure.

243
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,710
我们会做到的
We'll get it done.

244
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,180
至少那个时候  亚当就能记事了
At least by the time that Adam is old enough to remember.

245
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,120
我才离开了一小会  你就养了一个孩子
I leave for one minute, and you're raising a kid.

246
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,070
玛姬  如果我
Maggie, if I, uh...

247
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,810
我们回去再说  好吗
We'll start when we get back, okay?

248
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,040
好消息是  他住在亚历山大  所以
The good news is, he lives in Alexandria, so...

249
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,010
小小的胜利
small wins.

250
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,230
搞什么
What the hell?

251
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,870
{\an8}犹大[叛徒]

252
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,660
这边
This way.

253
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,640
快来
Come on!

254
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,940
我们走
Let's go.

255
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,100
我帮他
I got him.

256
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,660
阿加莎
Agatha!

257
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,280
-走  快走  -不  不要
- Go! Just go! - No! Come on!

258
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,750
-快走  -不
- Run! - No!

259
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,210
-快走  -不
- Run! - No!

260
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,370
阿加莎  不
Agatha, no!

261
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,220
不  放手
No! Get off!

262
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,460
不  不  不
No! No! No! No! No!

263
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,010
看  她们回来了
Look! They're back!

264
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,450
她们找回马了
They've got the horses!

265
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,950
天啊
Oh, my God!

266
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,850
我去叫亚伦
I'll go get Aaron.

267
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,900
好  我走了
Alright, I'm out.

268
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,250
拜
Bye.

269
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,310
好孩子
Very good boy.

270
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,220
卡萝尔
Hey, Carol.

271
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,000
能聊聊吗
Can we talk?

272
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,280
当然
Yeah, sure.

273
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,410
我知道你在做什么  我要你停手
I know what you're doing, and I want you to stop.

274
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,160
什么
Sorry?

275
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,170
你给了凯利虚假的希望
You're giving Kelly false hope.

276
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,920
我不懂
I-I don't understand.

277
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,070
你懂
Yes, you do.

278
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,440
你不觉得康妮还活着
You don't think Connie's alive.

279
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,030
你只是无法接受她的死所带来的后果
You just can't accept what it means if she's not.

280
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,510
你是康妮的家人
Well, you're Connie's family.

281
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,580
我以为你想知道她的生死
I would think you'd want to know either way.

282
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,660
我希望我的家人能走出来
I want my family to heal.

283
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
仅剩的家人
All that's left of it.

284
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,840
凯利仰慕你
Kelly looks up to you.

285
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,340
卡萝尔  我对你所经历的一切很抱歉
Carol, I'm sorry for whatever you're going through,

286
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,660
但我想请你  我求求你
but I'm asking you, I'm begging you,

287
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,300
不管你在做什么或对她说什么  停下吧
whatever you are doing or telling her, stop.

288
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,920
你让一切变得更难了
You're just making it harder.

289
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,680
走吧  朋友
Come on, buddy.

290
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,270
好了
There you go.

291
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,990
吃吧
Go on.

292
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,960
不  谢了
No, thank you.

293
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,060
一次咬一小口
Just take really small bites.

294
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,810
越小越好
The smaller, the better.

295
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,660
你以前吃过吗
You've eaten it before?

296
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,410
嗯  跟我妈妈漂泊时吃过
Yeah, on the road, with my mom.

297
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,260
找到什么吃什么
You eat what you find.

298
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,490
你漂泊过吗
You ever been on the road?

299
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,470
没像那样漂泊过
Not like that.

300
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,960
你能遇到很多不同的人

301
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,630
快点嚼
Just chew it fast.

302
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,840
没那么难吃
It's not that bad.

303
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,310
没蜘蛛难吃
Not like the spiders.

304
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,140
想不想摸小马

305

看

它们有兴趣

307
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,010
你想摸小马吗
Do you want to pet a pony? 

308
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,980
很漂亮吧  快看

309
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,840
好了吗
Ready?

310
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
真他妈恶心
Goddamn shit.

311
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,630
怎么
What?

312
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,750
你喜欢吃烂纸板吗
You like the taste of crap cardboard?

313
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,750
我们应该回到树林里
We should get back in the woods.

314
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,430
走大路更快
The road is faster.

315
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,310
他说得对  树林里有掩护  更安全
He's right. The woods have cover. It's safer.

316
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,320
我们去那里
Let's go there.

317
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,220
不
No.

318
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,700
我们得继续前进

319
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,410
不  我们得休息
No, we need a break.

320
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,530
我们在这里休息一下  然后出发
We'll rest here for a while, and then we'll head out.

321
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,610
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

322
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,790
回答是不行
The answer is no.

323
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,650
他是对的  玛姬
He's right, Maggie.

324
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,110
我拖累你们了

325
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,920
不

326
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,920
没事的
We're fine.

327
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,310
也许现在没事
Maybe now.

328
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,750
如果那些人和你所说的一样
If these guys are anything like you say they are,

329
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,980
情况就会变得更糟
then it's gonna get worse.

330
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,490
我是个累赘
I'm dead weight.

331
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,310
我们都知道
We all know it.

332
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,620
我们会帮你的
We'll help you.

333
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,030
你想知道我为什么离开了他
You wanna know why I walked away from him...

334
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,120
和他所代表的一切
and everything he stood for...

335
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,120
加入了你吗
joined up with you?

336
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,990
因为我信任你
It's 'cause I trust you...

337
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,510
能做正确的事
to do the right thing.

338
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,780
不管有多难  要付出多大代价
No matter how hard it is or how much it costs you.

339
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,680
补给  玛姬  看着我
The supplies -- Maggie, look at me.

340
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,000
补给是现在唯一重要的事
The supplies are the only thing that matters now.

341
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,180
亚历山大需要我们取回补给
Alexandria needs us to do this.

342
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,330
他们在等着我们

343
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,740
赫谢尔和朱迪思
Hershel and Judith.

344
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,950
亚当
Adam...

345
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,250
亚当需要一个父亲
And Adam needs a father.

346
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,270
你觉得我这样能活着离开那个镇子吗
You think I'm gonna make it out of that town alive like this?

347
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,980
你丢下了盖奇  也丢下我吧
You left Gage. Leave me.

348
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,780
盖奇做出了选择
Gage made his choice.

349
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,340
我也做出了选择
And I'm making mine.

350
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,480
不
No.

351
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,020
就...
Just...

352
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,670
不
No.

353
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,640
玛姬  如果这个计划失败了
Maggie, if this plan fails...

354
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,780
那你所为之奋斗的一切
then everything you've worked for,

355
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,370
你对未来的一切愿景
everything you want for the future,

356
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,880
都会破灭
it dies with it.

357
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,840
然后亚当会怎样呢
And then what happens to Adam?

358
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,280
好吧
Okay.

359
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,530
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

360
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,200
就这么简单
Yeah, it is.

361
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,540
太阳要下山了
The sun is going down.

362
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,270
玛姬
Maggie...

363
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,160
你必须做出选择
you have to make a decision.

364
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,130
对你来说很简单吧
It's easy for you, isn't it?

365
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,650
全然不顾别人的性命
Being reckless with somebody else's life.

366
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,030
但别人的生死现在不由你决定了
But you don't get to decide who lives and who dies anymore.

367
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,200
这是你的错
It's your fault.

368
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,920
我们变成这样
That we're here.

369
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,430
这是你的错
It's your fault.

370
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,120
因为你毁掉了我们所建立的一切
Because you destroyed everything that we built.

371
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,970
你依然要做出决定
You still have to decide.

372
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,260
玛姬
Ma-- Maggie.

373
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,590
给
Here.

374
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,350
等我们回来时  你最好还在这里
You better be here when we get back.

375
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,500
你们最好能回来
You better come back.
