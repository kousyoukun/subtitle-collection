14
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,480
Previously on "The Walking Dead"...

15
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,060
We just took in two new communities.

16
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,500
We have no crops, no back stock.

17
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,430
The last big horde scared all the animals away.

18
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,860
We can find new territory.

19
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,750
We don't have time. We need food. 

20
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,340
Lots of it. Now.

21
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,530
The people that attacked us --

22
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,410
we only knew two things about them.

23
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,840
They come at night.

24
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,510
And by the time you see them, you're already dead.

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,690
Run!

26
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,050
Dog!

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,850
Elijah!

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,340
No!

29
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,220
See you in 30.

30
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,610
Kel. Kel, Kel.

31
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,450
I missed you this morning.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,030
Thought we had a shift together.

33
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,800
Sorry. Something came up.

34
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,120
You still want to do those shifts with me?

35
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,460
It's okay if you don't.

36
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,680
Next one. I promise.

37
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,860
Kel.

38
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,050
Do you...

39
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,020
Do you wanna talk about it?

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,290
Nothing to talk about.

41
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,460
Come on. Everyone -- pull!

42
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,150
Hey. Going somewhere?

43
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,380
We need to get our horses back.

44
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,650
You see the east wall when you came in?

45
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,500
I did.

46
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,210
You were marked down to help today.

47
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,190
Looks like you've got a crew already.

48
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,880
Well, you were gone all morning.

49
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,190
We started without you.

50
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,630
I'm sorry, Aaron. I can't today.

51
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,110
Because you're tracking horses

52
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,240
that you have almost no hope of catching?

53
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,090
You know, Daryl and I went down that road before.

54
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
Didn't work out so well for Buttons.

55
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,000
We're almost out of MREs,

56
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,770
and the fields are a joke --

57
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,560
And our walls are about to fail.

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, if we don't get those horses,

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,310
we're not gonna be able to move anything heavier

60
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,780
than a sack of grain.

61
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,390
Or go out far enough to scavenge anything,

62
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,070
and we're all gonna starve to death.

63
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,270
So I'll be back in a few hours.

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm hungry, too.

65
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,200
Do you ever worry about your mom when she goes away?

66
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,420
I'm used to it.

67
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,520
Grown-ups are always running off doing things.

68
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,010
"Promise I'll see you soon.

69
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,350
Love you."

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,570
They used to say that kind of stuff in the olden times, right?

71
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,640
They can't promise it now, but they say it anyways.

72
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,360
They don't want us to think they're never coming back.

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,930
It's supposed to make us feel better.

74
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,070
They say it to make themselvesfeel better.

75
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,800
Still...

76
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,420
my mom always comes back.

77
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,170
Yeah.

78
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,960
Dang it.

79
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,620
Lord, you are my refuge and my strength...

80
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,610
My refuge and my strength...

81
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,860
My refuge...

82
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
Alden.

83
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,070
Maggie.

84
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,060
Jesus.

85
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,710
Let me see?

86
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,190
Sure thing, boss.

87
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,250
That good, huh?

88
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,780
You think you can walk?

89
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,830
Not gonna know until we try. 

90
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,330
You're not seriously thinking that we keep going.

91
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,830
They'll be back. We gotta keep moving.

92
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,410
Alright, wait. What exactly is the plan here?

93
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,520
The plan doesn't change.

94
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,690
We need that food.

95
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,810
We get to the radio tower, find the supply house,

96
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,170
and wait for the others.

97
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,130
And what if the others are dead?

98
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,690
Listen, I know theatrics.

99
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,050
Those people, they just told us

100
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,890
exactly how insane they are.

101
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,590
We can't be on a road.

102
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,390
We can't be on any road that they could use.

103
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,500
It's a shit plan.

104
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,520
Then you tell me a better one

105
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,220
that doesn't starve us all.

106
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,910
Right.

107
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,900
I am on your side, Maggie.

108
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
Then help me with him.

109
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,890
2, 3, go.

110
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,690
No.

111
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,100
Not unless you want Coco tripping the light fantastic.

112
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,300
Yeah, but just for like a week, tops, right?

113
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,190
- You good? - Yeah.

114
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,700
Yeah, it's just that Gabriel's on a mission,

115
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,550
and I'm over being stuck in the house.

116
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
Why? What're you guys doing?

117
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,170
Wait.

118
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,550
Damn it!

119
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,120
Fourth time's the charm.

120
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,400
Let's get a move on.

121
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,570
You okay?

122
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,340
I'll be better when this is done.

123
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,480
I've been having dreams about Abraham recently.

124
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,630
Yeah?

125
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,670
Yeah, he's trying to tell me something.

126
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,750
I know it's something important, something I'm supposed to do.

127
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,680
But I can't hear him most of the time,

128
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,110
and just when I'm about to...

129
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,050
he, um -- he gets shot in the head.

130
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,520
Well, that's dark.

131
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,870
Yeah, I don't know why I just told you that.

132
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,650
No, I get it.

133
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,830
It used to freak me out,

134
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,700
but now I think it's a message for us, for Alexandria.

135
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,510
What do you think he's trying to say?

136
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,970
I don't know.

137
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,150
You know, if a horse lets you touch its ear,

138
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,570
it means it trusts you.

139
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,600
I read that once.

140
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,050
You think we'll get them back?

141
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,080
Horses are wild creatures.

142
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,730
You never know.

143
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,330
It's 2 miles. It's further than I thought.

144
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,960
We better get moving.

145
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,070
Holding your hand's not gonna help me walk any faster.

146
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,160
Yeah? Does the thought of one of those things

147
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,210
ripping your face off do it for you?

148
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,370
If you're scared, why don't you

149
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,270
make yourself useful and go kill 'em?

150
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,010
Really? So we're just gonna go towards the screaming?

151
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,570
Cool.

152
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,580
Agatha!

153
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,670
Maggie. It's Duncan.

154
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,080
Duncan.

155
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,630
Duncan.

156
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm so sorry.

157
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,090
For all of it.

158
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,100
Why?

159
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,870
We were good.

160
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,080
We were lucky.

161
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,170
For a little while.

162
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Make sure she gets home.

163
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,200
Promise.

164
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,200
This way.

165
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,300
No.

166
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,300
No.

167
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,940
It can't be.

168
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,690
It's okay.

169
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,210
We'll keep looking for the rest.

170
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,150
They'll stay close to the water.

171
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,250
Not if it's full of corpses they won't.

172
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,790
Carol, it's getting late.

173
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,940
She's right.

174
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,220
We don't have to do this right now.

175
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,460
Let's come back tomorrow.

176
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,790
No, Alexandria needed these horses yesterday.

177
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,840
Carol...

178
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,670
Let's go home.

179
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,940
We'll try again.

180
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,660
Next time.

181
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,420
Maybe not.

182
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,900
Dope.

183
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,640
They're headed towards the dairy farm.

184
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,080
- And? - The dairy farm's got paddocks.

185
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,410
We can pen them in.

186
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,820
Come on. Let's go.

187
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,650
Easy now. Easy now.

188
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,810
Drop the lassos.

189
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,550
Why?

190
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,010
Just do it.

191
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,400
They're not running.

192
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,260
I think they want to come home.

193
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,080
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

195
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,780
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

196
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,230
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

197
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,070
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

198
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,100
You move slower than I thought you would.

199
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,290
Don't be scared.

200
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm not.

201
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,130
We have been blessed.

202
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,140
I...

203
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,720
I have been blessed.

204
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,390
You have a funny definition of blessed.

205
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,990
But it is you who has come for me.

206
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,440
Will you pray for me?

207
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,500
You tried to kill my friends.

208
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,650
Yes.

209
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,800
And they tried to kill me.

210
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,020
Pray for me.

211
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,480
Even your enemies deserve that much.

212
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,880
I thought you were a man of God.

213
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,160
God isn't here anymore.

214
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,050
Twice as many as before.

215
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,050
We need to rethink your plan, Maggie.

216
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,080
You're a free man, Negan. You wanna go?

217
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,320
Go.

218
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,590
I can help you.

219
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,430
You know, your friends, they trusted me.

220
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,150
You were gone for a long time.

221
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,890
Things change. People change.

222
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,320
No.

223
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,480
Maybe you've got them fooled, but not me.

224
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Stop pretending you're one of us, Negan.

225
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,460
Maybe you even believe it.

226
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,630
But you're probably as good at lying to yourself

227
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,170
as you are to everybody else.

228
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,460
You okay, Maggie?

229
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,040
Yeah.

230
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,130
I can handle Negan.

231
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,150
I wasn't talking about Negan.

232
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,060
This can't be what you thought you'd be coming home to.

233
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,370
It can't be what you told Hershel he'd see.

234
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,560
You know, not much surprises me anymore.

235
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,610
Except Hilltop.

236
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,790
It's not the place I told Hershel about.

237
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
Hold on a sec.

238
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,310
You know, I'm not sure much surprises him anymore, either.

239
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,960
You'll build it back up,

240
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,570
better than it was before.

241
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,040
We will.

242
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,420
Sure.

243
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,710
We'll get it done.

244
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,180
At least by the time that Adam is old enough to remember.

245
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,120
I leave for one minute, and you're raising a kid.

246
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,070
Maggie, if I, uh...

247
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,810
We'll start when we get back, okay?

248
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,040
The good news is, he lives in Alexandria, so...

249
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,010
small wins.

250
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,230
What the hell?

252
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,660
This way.

253
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,640
Come on!

254
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,940
Let's go.

255
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,100
I got him.

256
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,660
Agatha!

257
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,280
- Go! Just go! - No! Come on!

258
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,750
- Run! - No!

259
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,210
- Run! - No!

260
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,370
Agatha, no!

261
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,220
No! Get off!

262
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,460
No! No! No! No! No!

263
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,010
Look! They're back!

264
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,450
They've got the horses!

265
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,950
Oh, my God!

266
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,850
I'll go get Aaron.

267
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,900
Alright, I'm out.

268
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,250
Bye.

269
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,310
Very good boy.

270
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,220
Hey, Carol.

271
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,000
Can we talk?

272
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,280
Yeah, sure.

273
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,410
I know what you're doing, and I want you to stop.

274
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,160
Sorry?

275
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,170
You're giving Kelly false hope.

276
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,920
I-I don't understand.

277
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,070
Yes, you do.

278
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,440
You don't think Connie's alive.

279
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,030
You just can't accept what it means if she's not.

280
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,510
Well, you're Connie's family.

281
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,580
I would think you'd want to know either way.

282
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,660
I want my family to heal.

283
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
All that's left of it.

284
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,840
Kelly looks up to you.

285
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,340
Carol, I'm sorry for whatever you're going through,

286
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,660
but I'm asking you, I'm begging you,

287
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,300
whatever you are doing or telling her, stop.

288
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,920
You're just making it harder.

289
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,680
Come on, buddy.

290
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,270
There you go.

291
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,990
Go on.

292
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,960
No, thank you.

293
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,060
Just take really small bites.

294
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,810
The smaller, the better.

295
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,660
You've eaten it before?

296
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,410
Yeah, on the road, with my mom.

297
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,260
You eat what you find.

298
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,490
You ever been on the road?

299
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,470
Not like that.

300
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,960
Well, you meet a lot of different people.

301
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,630
Just chew it fast.

302
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,840
It's not that bad.

303
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,310
Not like the spiders.

304
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,140
Wanna see if we can pet a pony?

305
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,330
Look.

306
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,380
They're interested.

307
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,010
Do you want to pet a pony? 

308
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,980
Beautiful, right? Look. Look.

309
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,840
Ready?

310
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
Goddamn shit.

311
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,630
What?

312
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,750
You like the taste of crap cardboard?

313
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,750
We should get back in the woods.

314
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,430
The road is faster.

315
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,310
He's right. The woods have cover. It's safer.

316
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,320
Let's go there.

317
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,220
No.

318
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,700
We need to keep moving.

319
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,410
No, we need a break.

320
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,530
We'll rest here for a while, and then we'll head out.

321
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,610
I know what you're thinking.

322
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,790
The answer is no.

323
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,650
He's right, Maggie.

324
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,110
I'm slowing you down.

325
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,920
Nope.

326
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,920
We're fine.

327
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,310
Maybe now.

328
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,750
If these guys are anything like you say they are,

329
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,980
then it's gonna get worse.

330
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,490
I'm dead weight.

331
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,310
We all know it.

332
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,620
We'll help you.

333
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,030
You wanna know why I walked away from him...

334
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,120
and everything he stood for...

335
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,120
joined up with you?

336
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,990
It's 'cause I trust you...

337
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,510
to do the right thing.

338
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,780
No matter how hard it is or how much it costs you.

339
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,680
The supplies -- Maggie, look at me.

340
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,000
The supplies are the only thing that matters now.

341
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,180
Alexandria needs us to do this.

342
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,330
They're waiting for us.

343
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,740
Hershel and Judith.

344
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,950
Adam...

345
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,250
And Adam needs a father.

346
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,270
You think I'm gonna make it out of that town alive like this?

347
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,980
You left Gage. Leave me.

348
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,780
Gage made his choice.

349
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,340
And I'm making mine.

350
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,480
No.

351
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,020
Just...

352
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,670
No.

353
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,640
Maggie, if this plan fails...

354
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,780
then everything you've worked for,

355
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,370
everything you want for the future,

356
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,880
it dies with it.

357
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,840
And then what happens to Adam?

358
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,280
Okay.

359
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,530
It's not that simple.

360
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,200
Yeah, it is.

361
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,540
The sun is going down.

362
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,270
Maggie...

363
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,160
you have to make a decision.

364
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,130
It's easy for you, isn't it?

365
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,650
Being reckless with somebody else's life.

366
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,030
But you don't get to decide who lives and who dies anymore.

367
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,200
It's your fault.

368
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,920
That we're here.

369
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,430
It's your fault.

370
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,120
Because you destroyed everything that we built.

371
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,970
You still have to decide.

372
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,260
Ma-- Maggie.

373
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,590
Here.

374
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,350
You better be here when we get back.

375
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,500
You better come back.
