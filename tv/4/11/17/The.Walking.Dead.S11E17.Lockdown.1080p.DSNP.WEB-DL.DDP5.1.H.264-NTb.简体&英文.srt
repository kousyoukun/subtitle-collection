1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,500
我听过很多关于世界毁灭时的故事
I've heard a lot of stories about when the world fell.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,420
死人多于活人
There were more dead than the living,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,840
世界好像开始会变冷
and it started to look like the world would go cold.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,220
感觉就快了 差不多了
It felt like it was almost there. Almost.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,640
有些人通过相互联系而幸存下来
Some people survived by connecting with each other.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,060
建立家庭
Making found families.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,110
其他人屈服于黑暗
Others gave in to the darkness.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,290
那是很久以前的事了 现在还是 明天也是吗
That was a long time ago. And it's now. Will it be tomorrow?

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,470
-安全 -安全
- Clear. - Clear.

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,770
分散 检查每个窗户 门口 楼梯和走廊
Fan out. Check every window, doorway, stairway and hallway.

11
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,070
-在此终结 -你觉得他们有多少人
- This ends here. - How many you think they got?

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,990
没关系 把他们一个接一个地干掉
Don't matter. Gonna take them out one by one.

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,590
看看我们找到了谁
Look who we found.

14
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,840
-赫歇尔呢  -他和以利亚还有其他人在一起
- Where's Hershel? - He's with Elijah and the others.

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,470
-他很隐蔽也很安全 -他很好 玛吉
- He's hidden and safe. - He's good, Maggie.

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,890
我们是来干掉军团的
We're here to take out shithead and the dickless brigade.

17
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,970
像我一直说的 我们应该先回联邦社区
Like I've been saying, we should go back to the Commonwealth first.

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,310
把我们的人带出来 然后一起对付霍恩斯比
Get our people out and then deal with Hornsby together.

19
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,690
不 加贝 他可能已经用无线电报信了 你知道的
No, Gabe, he probably already radioed back. You know that.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,820
听着 他认识我们 我们没法通过这些检查站
Look, he knows us. We're never getting through those checkpoints.

21
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,320
如果他在让他的人 追捕我们的家人呢
And if he has his people go after our families in the meantime?

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,570
卡罗尔在那儿 罗西塔 杰瑞 以西结也在
Carol's there. So is Rosita and Jerry, Ezekiel.

23
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,950
-希望他们能应付得来 -希望不多了
- We have hope they can handle it. - Hope is running low.

24
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
我们在这里辩论的时间越长
And the longer we're out here having these debates,

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,660
我们在家的家人面临的风险越大
the more our families back home are at risk.

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,870
我们的人也在这里
Our people are out here too.

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,670
我们需要在霍恩斯比抓住任何人之前 找到他并把他杀死
We need to find Hornsby and kill him before he gets to anybody.

28
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,420
等等
Wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up.

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,840
我们可以做到所有这一切 他们以前从未见过你
We can do all of this. They've never seen your face before.

30
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,970
你是说我直接闯进去
Are you saying I just walk right on in there?

31
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,470
是的 我就是这个意思
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm saying.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,770
-我也去 -不 安妮 你不能跟来
- Me too. - No, Annie, not you too.

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,730
我们中只有一人需要进入敌人的内部 嘿
Only one of us needs to go into the belly of the beast. Hey.

34
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,230
我需要你安全
I need you to be safe.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,490
再说了 不管怎样 我都得完蛋
Besides, I am fucked either way.

36
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,280
嘿 我不会那么容易被干掉的 好吗
Hey, you're not gonna get rid of me that easy, okay?

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,410
好吧 计划是什么
All right. So what's the play?

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,880
请回答 这是布拉沃队 我们需要清理第四象限
Come in. This is Bravo team. We need to clear out quadrant four.

39
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,380
-收到 布拉沃 -开始吧
- Copy that, Bravo. - Let's roll.

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,180
好吧 我们来了结这一切吧
All right, let's get this over with.

41
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,550
行尸走肉

42
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,540
第十一季  第十七集

43
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,540
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

44
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,670
有人盯着那辆该死的车吗
Does anyone have eyes on that goddamn car?

45
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,810
启动 我们需要向联邦传达信息
Fire it up. We need to get a message to the Commonwealth.

46
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,060
我觉得信号不够强
I don't think the signal is strong enough.

47
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,310
立即拨打
Dial in now.

48
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,690

Contingency protocol on Daryl Dixon. Aaron...

50
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,410
好吧 搜索信号 然后给家里发信息
All right, go find a goddamn signal and get a message home.

51
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,710
如果那辆车出现 确保我们的人已经做好准备
If that car shows up, make sure our people are on the wall, ready.

52
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,040
-是的 长官 -开枪射杀
- Yes, sir. - Shoot to kill.

53
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,890
我们看到被盗车辆向西行驶
We have visual on the stolen vehicle heading westbound.

54
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,900
-两分钟后开始拦截 -把它拿下 然后找到剩下的
-Moving to intercept, two minutes. - Take it down, then find the rest.

55
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,190
如果米尔顿或默瑟知道了 我们就完蛋了
If this gets back to Milton or Mercer, we're eighty-sixed.

56
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,690
我们现在要阻止
We contain this now.

57
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,610
杀了他
Kill him!

58
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,620
目标西行 保持稳定
Target westbound. Keep it steady.

59
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,080
快点
Faster.

60
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,100
抓紧 目标在往北行驶
Hold on. Target is now northbound.

61
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,240
保持稳定 我们几乎追上他了
Keep it steady. We almost got him.

62
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,080
试着在前面切断他
Try and cut him off up ahead.

63
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,350
我们要公正 交出塞巴斯蒂安
We want justice. Deliver Sebastian now.

64
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,230

69
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,290
联邦社区的公民
Citizens of the Commonwealth,

70
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,620
这是你们的州长 帕梅拉米尔顿
this is your governor, Pamela Milton.

71
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,170
我想让你们都知道
And I want you all to know,

72
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,790
这个所谓的报道不过是谎言
this so-called report is nothing but lies

73
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,130
意在向受够了苦难的人们传播恐惧和愤怒
meant to sow fear and anger in people who have suffered enough.

74
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,670
-我们要公正 -但我了解我的儿子
- We want justice. - But I know my son.

75
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,010
他不可能做出他被指控的那些可怕的事情
He couldn't have done the horrible things he's been accused of.

76
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,680
我们要公正
We want justice.

77
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,060
-他是个不错的年轻人 -交出塞巴斯蒂安

我们要公正
We want justice.

79
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,480
这是我们想要的吗
And the Commonwealth is his home.

80
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,060
联邦社区是他的家

81
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,650
这就是变革的样子

82
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,230
交出塞巴斯蒂安
Deliver Sebastian now.

83
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,650
我们要坚持下去

84

他绝不会做任何破坏
He would never do anything to undermine

85
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,070
我们伟大社区...
the safety and stability...

86
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,190
还有人下落不明 他们在某个地方
-...of our great community.

87
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,280
- ...安全性和稳定性的事

88
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,740
-我们要公正 -这可能会有危险
- We want justice. - This could get ugly.

89
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,450
如果事态变糟 我们需要准备好帮助这些人
We need to be ready to help these people if it goes sideways.

90
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,330
情况变得更糟只是时间问题
It's only a matter of time until this gets worse.

91
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,130
-我们需要各种方案 -你的意思是离开
- We need options. - What you mean, leave?

92
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,050
不 我不想离开 这些人需要我们的帮助
No. I don't wanna leave. These people need our help.

93
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,970
在每个人都回来之前 我们不要做任何决定 好吗
Nothing gets decided until everyone's back, okay?

94
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,930
保护车站
Secure the station.

95
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,470
我们要公正 交出塞巴斯蒂安
We want justice. Deliver Sebastian now.

96
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,350
我们要公正
We want justice.

97
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,930
这是一种荣誉和特权
That calling is an honor and a privilege.

98
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,650
-他在里面 把他交出来 -交出塞巴斯蒂安
- He's in there. Bring him out. - Deliver Sebastian now.

99
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,820
-你为什么没穿制服  -休假
- What are you doing out of uniform? - Personal day.

100
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,650
今天不行 不能在这种情况下
Not today. Not with all of this.

101
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
这不是我的问题 也不是你的
This isn't my problem. It's not yours either.

102
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,330
默瑟上将 长官 有事需要你尽快处理
General Mercer, sir. You're needed in processing, ASAP.

103
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,660
现在不行
Not now.

104
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,160
你会想看这个的 长官
You're gonna want to see this one, sir.

105
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,460
好吧 我这就来
All right, I'm on my way.

106
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,630
我今天需要你 这些人需要你 现在去换制服
I need you today. These people do. Now suit up.

107
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,720
我们要公正
We want justice.

108
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,430
我很快会找到真正的肇事者 并将他们绳之以法
Soon I will find the real culprits and bring them to justice.

109
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,730
下面我将回答一些公民提出的书面问题
Now I will answer some written questions submitted by citizens.

110
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,030
你觉得她知道他在哪里吗
You think she knows where he is?

111
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,030
不 可能躲起来了
No. Probably in hiding.

112
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,540
比起那些人 他更害怕她
He's more afraid of her than he is of them.

113
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,410
嘿 你还好吗
Hey, you okay?

114
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,080
-“你在怎样找他 ” -是的
-"What are you doing to find him?" - Yeah.

115
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,670
我们在跟踪多个线索 并且不会停止...
We are following multiple leads and will not stop...

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,380
我想继续
I wanna keep going.

117
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,340
那我们就继续
Then we will.

118
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,220
我们正在努力寻找
We are working diligently to find the people responsible for

119
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,480
散布这些谎言的人 请放心 他们一定会被绳之以法
spreading these lies. Rest assured, they will be brought to justice.

120
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
你认识我吗
Do you know me?

121
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,540
是的 在荒地上听说过
Yeah, word gets around the wasteland.

122
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,920
所以 不认识
So, no?

123
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,130
一个朋友告诉我关于你的事
A friend told me about you.

124
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,260
说我来找她时应该找你
Said that I should ask for you when I came looking for her.

125
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,680

April. When I came looking for April.

126
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,070
你知道她发生了什么事吗
Do you know what happened to her?

127
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,240
你问我这个就表示不是好事
I think you asking me that means that it can't be good.

128
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,290
你来这里的真正原因是什么
Why are you really here?

129
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,580
我遇到了一些麻烦
I ran into some trouble.

130
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,710
一个穿衬衫打领带的混蛋
Some shirt-and-tie-wearing shit

131
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,090
和他一起做事的走狗

135
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,820
达里尔
Daryl.

136
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,330
所以 听着 霍恩斯比这个混蛋
So, listen. So, this Hornsby prick?

137
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,790
他一直在追杀我们 我们在处理这个情况
He's been cutting us up out there, and we're dealing with it.

138
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,040
但是 问题是这里也有我们需要保护的人
But, see, the problem is that we got people in here to protect too.

139
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,670
那是我的工作
That's my job.

140
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,760
-但我还是被派到这里来了 -我不能让你随便就进来
- And yet I was sent here anyway. - I can't just let you in.

141
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,720
-我们这里有规则 -规则 对啊
- We got rules here. - Rules. Right.

142
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,810
好吧 如果其他人都不遵守这些规则 那你为什么要遵守呢
Well, if no else is playing by those rules, then why are you?

143
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,700
卡罗尔阿姨 蓝莓煎饼要烧焦了
- Aunt Carol? - Hmm? The blueberry pancakes are burning.

144
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,920
糟糕 你不喜欢烧焦的
Oh. Oh, no. You don't like them burned?

145
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,300
-不 -你错过美味了
Not really. You're missing out.

146
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,430
这些是凯利拍的 为什么
- Kelly took these? What for?

147
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,190
所以我们可以了解这个地方 留意事情
So we can learn about this place. Keep an eye on things.

148
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,070
亚伦叔叔和达里尔叔叔什么时候回来
When are Uncle Aaron and Uncle Daryl coming back?

149
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,360
怎么 你更喜欢他们做的食物
What, you like their cooking better?

150
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,200
怎么会 除非有篝火 否则达里尔不知道他在做什么
No way. Unless there's a campfire, Daryl has no idea what he's doing.

151
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,200
我爸爸无论在哪里都能做出好吃的
My dad's a good cook wherever he is.

152
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,870
他们很快就会回来的
They'll be back soon.

153
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,480
-怎么了  -也许没什么
- What is it? - Maybe nothing.

154
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,480
好了 你们起来 我们得离开这
All right. You guys get up. We got to move.

155
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,900
不过早餐...
But breakfast...

156
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,240
不 我们稍后会回来 现在我们必须躲起来
No, we'll come back later. Right now we got to play the quiet game.

157
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,640
没人 你确定他没说别的吗
It's empty. Are you sure he didn't say anything else?

158
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,940
只出现了迪克森的名字
Dixon was the only name that came through.

159
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,360
我们去学校检查一下
Let's check the school.

160
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,480
老兄 什么鬼 你在这里做什么 伙计
Dude. What the hell? What are you doing here, man?

161
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,440
我是来救你们的
Well, I'm here to save your asses.

162
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,940
卡罗尔在哪
Where is Carol?

163
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,830
好
Okay.

164
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,340
查理威士忌艾克丘尔
Charlie Whiskey Actual.

165
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,800
查理威士忌艾克丘尔 这是外勤队布拉沃
Charlie Whiskey Actual, this is field unit Bravo.

166
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,600
查理威士忌艾克丘尔 这是外勤队布拉沃
Charlie Whiskey Actual. Charlie Whiskey Actual, this is field unit Bravo.

167
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,820
收到 这是艾克丘尔 请说
Copy. This is Actual. Go ahead.

168
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,900
艾克丘尔 这是外勤队布拉沃 OTB
Actual, this is field unit Bravo OTB.

169
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,620
如下是来自霍恩斯比的讯息
Message from Hornsby, as follows...

170
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,800
外勤队 再说一遍 我没收到
Field unit, come back. I didn't get that.

171
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,640
我们今天要来个小冒险
We're just gonna have a little adventure today.

172
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,820
我需要你们回卧室等着
I need you guys to go back to the bedroom and wait.

173
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,780
在我叫你们之前不要出来 去吧
And don't come out until I call. Go.

174
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,820
卡罗尔 安全了
Carol, it's clear.

175
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
嘿
Hey. Hey.

176
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,620
事实证明你可能是对的
Turns out you might have been right.

177
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,670
我可能应该呆在那该死的小屋里
I probably should've stayed in the goddamn cabin.

178
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,090
霍恩斯比试图通过审问赫歇尔来惊吓玛吉
Hornsby tried to scare Maggie by interrogating Hershel.

179
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,170
所以我们猜他会以某种方式尝试
So the thought is that he is somehow gonna try

180
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,220
用孩子们把我们的人引出来
to use the kids to draw our people out.

181
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,970
所以他们来找达里尔
And that's why they came for Daryl.

182
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
但如果霍恩斯比派了刚才那两个 他一直在秘密进行
But if Hornsby sent those two, he's keeping it under the radar.

183
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,730
这意味着我们可能在他们之前找到他
Which means we might be able to get ahead of them. And him.

184
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,980
杰瑞 你还能进入那个阁楼空间吗
Jerry, do you still have access to that attic space?

185
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,980
是的 女士 如你所要求的 备有供应品
Yes, ma'am. Stocked with supplies, like you asked.

186
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,570
把孩子们带去那里 然后告诉其他人
Keep the kids there, and get word to the others.

187
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,450
告诉他们准备好 收到你的信号就行动
Tell them to be ready to move on your signal.

188
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,910
-我会开始步骤 -准备好做什么
- I'll start the chain. - Ready for what?

189
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,160
这里似乎不是那种
I mean, this doesn't seem like the kind of place

190
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,330
你可以牵着手随意走出前门的地方
that you can just stroll out the front gate hand in hand.

191
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,000
所以我和你要去试着获得一些保障
That's why me and you are gonna go try to get some insurance.

192
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,010
她来了 在那边
There she is. Over there.

193
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,850
我们的女儿死了 你打算怎么办
Our daughter's dead. What are you gonna do?

194
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,930
我无法想象你们所经历的痛苦
I can't imagine the pain you've experienced,

195
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,390
我也感到恐惧
and I share your horror.

196
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,730
虽然我无法带回你们所爱之人
Though I can't bring your loved ones back,

197
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,310
但我会对发生的事追查到底
I will get to the bottom of what happened

198
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,860
找到肇事者
and who was responsible.

199
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,780
我们知道是谁干的 是他
We know who did this. He did this.

200
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,570
-你把你儿子藏在哪里了  -你们读到的不是事实
- Where are you hiding your son? - What you read was not the truth.

201
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,280
-你知道他在哪 -好吧 够了
- You know where he is. - All right. That's enough.

202
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,240
退后 马上
Get back. Now.

203
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,910
不然呢 你会让我们也消失吗
Or what? You gonna disappear us too?

204
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,710
-嘿 我们理解你们的心情 真的 -冷静
- Hey. We hear you. We do. - Calm down.

205
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,050
在你们经历了灾难后来到这里 然后以这种方式失去亲人
To make it here, after everything, and then lose loved ones this way?

206
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,720
这是不可想象的 我们会查明发生了什么
It's unthinkable. We will find out what happened.

207
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,390
我们将在整个过程中向你们更新
And we will update you on every step of the investigation

208
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,060
调查的每一步 好吗
throughout the whole process, okay?

209
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,100
来吧 大家都出去
Come on. Everybody out.

210
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,690
-你听到了 走吧 -我们走吧
- You heard him. Move along. - Let's go.

211
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,810
走吧
Move it.

212
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,650
你 走吧
You, move along.

213
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,900
-我厌倦了谎言 -你的手上沾满了每个人的血
I am tired of the lies. Everyone's blood is on your hands.

214
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,410
-都离开这里 -我们不会去任何地方
Clear the area. We are not gonna go anywhere.

215
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,620
-来吧 -我们要...
Come on. We want...

216
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,330
-走吧 -好吧 那很好
Move it along. All right, that's good.

217
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,910
你的朋友康妮 那个记者
Your friend, Connie, the journalist.

218
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,410
你觉得她会知道
You don't suppose she would have an idea

219
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,000
那篇文章是谁写的吗
who wrote that piece, do you?

220
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,790
如果她知道 我会感到惊讶
It would surprise me if she did.

221
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,720
打倒米尔顿一家
Down with the Miltons. Down with the Miltons.

222
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,480
-打倒米尔顿一家 -她来了

223

228
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,320
打倒米尔顿一家
Down with the Miltons. Down with the Miltons.

229
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,450
米尔顿一家是凶手

230
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,660
塞巴斯蒂安在哪
Where's Sebastian?

231
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,960
我们要塞巴斯蒂安 帕梅拉 他在哪
MAN 2: We want Sebastian. Pamela, where is he?

232
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,880
B14
B14.

233
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,720

Do it right away.

234
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,430
你是什么意思 帕梅拉知道
What do you mean, Pamela knows?

235
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,690
怀疑 你知道 至少是怀疑 谁是这篇文章的幕后黑手
Well, suspects, you know, at least, who's behind the article.

236
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,860
-但她没有任何证据 -还没有
- But she doesn't have any proof. - Not yet.

237
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,570
你告诉康妮了吗
Have you told Connie?

238
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,110
我真的很想先和你谈谈
I really wanted to talk to you first.

239
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,410
但你知道她的性格
But you know what she's like.

240
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,160
她永远不会逃避战斗
She's never gonna run away from a fight.

241
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,000
-你认为我会  -拜托
- You think I will? - Please.

242
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,710
从一开始 你就已经看到了 这个地方的本质
From the beginning, you've seen this place for what it is.

243
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,210
你从不支持胡编乱造 这是你更好的品质之一
You've never stood for bullshit. It's one of your better qualities.

244
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,090
但你比谁都知道
But you know more than anyone,

245
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,220
我们知道什么时候该离开 这让我们度过了很多难关
we've made it through a lot by knowing when it's good to go.

246
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,310
如果这里的情况变糟 我想为你们制定 一个可靠的撤离计划
And if things go bad here, I want a strong exit plan for you guys.

247
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,350
“你们”
"You guys"?

248
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,770
别这样 麦格纳 你知道我不能丢下托米
Come on, Magna. You know I can't leave Tomi.

249
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,990
没有你 我们哪儿也不去 就是这样
We don't go anywhere without you. End of story.

250
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,450
-不 麦格纳 那不是... -美子
- No, Magna. That's not... - Miko.

251
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,080
如果到时间离开了 那么我们就都走
If the time comes to go, then we're all going,

252
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,460
即使我必须拖着你和托米
even if I have to drag you and Tomi along.

253
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,920
在那之前 我们会保持警惕 尽我们所能帮助每一个人
Until then, we keep our eyes peeled, help everyone we can,

254
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,090
并等待最后的结果
and wait for the other shoe to drop.

255
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,340
你太固执了
You're so stubborn.

256
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,970
不是我更好的品质之一 但你似乎从不介意
Not one of my better qualities. But you never seemed to mind.

257
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,310
已启动封锁程序

265
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,950
我们在八公里外发现了一群僵尸
A swarm has been detected five miles out.

266
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,960
州长帕梅拉米尔顿已下令实施封锁
Lockdown has been instituted by order of Governor Pamela Milton.

267
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,540
立即返回你们的家
Return to your homes immediately.

268
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,000
宵禁后 任何在街上出现的人
After curfew, anyone found on the streets

269
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,050
都会为了他自身的安全而被捕
will be arrested for their own safety.

270
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,170
离开这里
Clear the area.

271
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,090
我再说一遍 在八公里外发现了一群僵尸
I repeat, a swarm has been detected five miles out.

272
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,590
-离开这里 所有人 -好吧 好的
- Clear out, everyone. - All right. Okay.

273
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,310
我们勇敢的联邦军队将在它们...
Our brave Commonwealth Army will be intercepting it...

274
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,470
来吧 我们走吧
Come on. Let's go.

275
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,890
- ...到达我们的大门前拦截它们 -你听到他说的了 我们走吧
- ...before it reaches our gates. - You heard him. Let's go.

276
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,600
支持他们的行动 回家吧 注意安全
Support their efforts. Go home. Stay safe.

277
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,730
-待在那里 直到另行通知 -你们不能留在这里
- Stay there until further notice. - You can't stay here.

278
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,900
人们正在死去
People are dying. People are dying.

279
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,570
我重复
I repeat,

280
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,950
州长帕梅拉米尔顿已下令实施封锁
lockdown has been instituted by order of Governor Pamela Milton.

281
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,040
-小心 这里有孩子 -能帮一下吗 有人在跟踪我们
Take it easy. There are kids here. A little help? We got a tail

282
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,630
跟上我 好吗 我们需要开车
Keep up with me, okay? We're gonna need to motor.

283
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,840
来吧
Come on. Come on.

284
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,630
别挡路
Get out of the way.

285
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,100
回到你们的家
Return to your homes.

286
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,150
宵禁后 任何在街头出现的人
After curfew, anyone found on the streets

287
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,610
都会为了他的自身安全被捕
will be arrested for their own safety.

288
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,860
好的 我们到底在寻找什么
All right. What are we looking for exactly?

289
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,360
蓝图 示意图
Uh... Blueprints, schematics.

290
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,450
联合车站的计划一定在这的某个地方
Plans for Union Station have to be here somewhere.

291
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,830
还有什么
And what else?

292
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,040
我要找的人在人们开始要他的脑袋前
The person that I'm looking for was in the building

293
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,830
就在这栋大楼里
right before people started calling for his head.

294
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,420
所以他可能留了下来
So he may have stayed.

295
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,260
所以如果他留了下来 每个人都在找他
So if he stayed and everybody was looking for him,

296
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,680
他的藏身之处可不一般
then he has one hell of a hiding spot.

297
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,180
是的
Yeah.

298
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,350
嘿 我有告诉你我结婚了吗
Hey, did I tell you I got married?

299
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,110
你为什么现在告诉我这个
Why are you telling me this now?

300
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,200
嗯 我不知道 因为...
Well, I don't know. Because...

301
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,870
因为她在外面
Because she is out there

302
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,410
她怀着我们的孩子
and she is carrying our child.

303
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,630
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

304
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,600
-谢谢 -是的
- Thank you. - Yeah.

305
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,650
往右
Go right.

306
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,490
收到 向右移动
Copy. Move right.

307
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,680
检查前面
Check up ahead.

308
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,730
-其他人在哪里  -他们会来的
- Where are the others? - They'll be here.

309
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,900
达里尔 你在那做的...
Daryl, what you did back there...

310
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,900
我知道利亚对你来说很重要
I know that Leah meant something to you.

311
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,820
对不起
I'm sorry.

312
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,490
格伦会希望我照顾你的
Glenn would've wanted me to look after you.

313
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,460
你不必说对不起 不必对我说
You don't have to ever say sorry. Not to me.

314
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,960
嘿 发现什么了吗
Hey. Hey. Anything?

315
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,470
他带了一半的人在前面搜寻
He's dug in up ahead with half his men.

316
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,090
我们不能靠近
We wouldn't get close.

317
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,260
其他人在从后面攻击我们
The others are flanking us from behind.

318
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,930
我们应该在他们把我们堵死之前往东走
We should go east before they pin us in.

319
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,020
有什么办法可以移向他们后面吗
Is there any way to get behind them?

320
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,150
那样会被他们发现的
Not without them spotting us.

321
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,400
除非他们看不到我们过来
Unless they never see us coming.

322
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,870
上 孩子
Come on. Come on, buddy.

323
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,960
快
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

324
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,640
上
Go, go, go. Go, go.

325
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,310
你好 请帮个小忙
Hello there. Small favor, please.

326
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,860
现在出来了
Coming out now.

327
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,190
我们出发前的最后召集
Last call before we head out.

328
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,190
你来了
You made it.

329
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,410
我听说有僵尸要杀 我无法抗拒
I heard walkers needed killing. I couldn't resist.

330
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,120
僵尸已通过第二个检查站
Swarm has passed the second checkpoint.

331
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,250
-我们需要支援 -坚守位置 我们马上到
- We need support. - Hold your position. On our way.

332
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,500

Moving out.

333
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,820
-你还好吗  -是的
- You okay? - Yeah.

334
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,910
-只是...你知道 -是的 我知道
- Just... You know. - Yeah, I do.

335
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,620
-你想休息一下吗  -不 我们应该继续前进
- You want to take a minute? - No. We should keep going.

336
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,830
如果我们继续朝这边走 我们应该会追上他们
If we keep going that way, we should come up right behind them.

337
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,500
也许我们可以让他们到我们这里来
Maybe we can get them to come down here to us.

338
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,190
我不想这么说 但我们已经没有可搜索的地方了
I hate to say it, but we are running out of places to look.

339
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,360
让我看看那个
Let me have a look at that.

340
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
-怎么了  -这里应该有一扇门
- What? - Should be a door here.

341
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,710
天哪
Jesus.

342
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,350
什么鬼
What the hell?

343
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,890
你们是怎么进来的
How'd you guys get in here?

344
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,310
-放松 伙计 -放开我
Easy, champ. Get them off me.

345
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,690
这是什么
What do we have here?

346
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,780
-你知道我是谁吗  -你知道我是谁吗
- Do you know who I am? - Oh. Do you know who I am?

347
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,790
你们这些混蛋想要什么
What do you assholes want?

348
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,540
起来 我们带你回家见你妈妈
Get up. We're taking you home to your mother.

349
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,710
在这件事结束之前 我不会去任何地方
I'm not going anywhere until this thing blows over.

350
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,510
-反正我妈妈也不在乎 -她在乎的 你是她的孩子
- My mother doesn't care anyway. - Yes, she does. You're her kid.

351
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,840
联邦是她的孩子 我只是个麻烦
The Commonwealth is her kid. I'm just a problem.

352
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,260
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

353
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,100
嘿 小子 当你拿罐子撒尿 每个人都想要你死的时候
Hey, Junior, when you're pissing in jars and everybody wants you dead,

354
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,610
我可能是疯了 但我想也许是时候该 重新考虑你的选择了
call me nuts, but I think maybe it's time to rethink your options.

355
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,070
这里的这位 她是个超级魔术师
Now, this one here, well, she's a goddamn magician.

356
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,740
我亲眼见过她做的
I have seen her pull little bunnies right out of her ass

357
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,910
不可思议的事
with my very own two eyes.

358
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,040
所以 如果 无论出于何种原因 她要救你
So if, for whatever reason, she is throwing you a life raft,

359
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,120
那么 我建议你接受
well, then I recommend you jump in that sucker

360
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,830
来解救自己
and save yourself from drowning.

361
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,260
你真觉得你能帮上忙
You really think you can help?

362
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,530
停 你们违反了宵禁
Stop. You are in violation of curfew.

363
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,580
僵尸已经过前两个外部检查站
The swarm is past the first two outer checkpoints.

364
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,790
马上回家
Go to your homes immediately.

365
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,590
我们的女儿永远也不能回家了
My daughter can never return home.

366
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:19,050
直到他们交出塞巴斯蒂安米尔顿 我们哪都不去
And we're not moving until Sebastian Milton is brought to us.

367
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,350
对
Yeah. Yeah.

368
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,100
我是亨德森 我们有情况
This is Henderson. We have a situation.

369
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,540
嘿 我找到他了
Hey. Hey. I found him.

370
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,330
我找到他了 塞巴斯蒂安在这里 他在这里
I found him. Sebastian's here. He's over here.

371
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,170
你们去吧 我会处理好这件事的
You guys go. I'll take care of this.

372
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,250
你弄错人了
Ooh. You got the wrong guy.

373
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,670
他在这里 塞巴斯蒂安在这 他要跑了
He's over here. Sebastian's here. He's getting away.

374
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,840
你弄错了
You are mistaken.

375
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,100
来吧 我们走 抓住他 别让他跑了
Come on. Let's go. Let's get him. Don't let him go.

376
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,940
这是你们的最后警告 回家 在这里不安全
This is your final warning. Go home. You are not safe here.

377
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,320
帕梅拉撒谎 塞巴斯蒂安杀人
Pamela lies. Sebastian kills.

378
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,240
-这是为了你们自身的安全 -塞巴斯蒂安杀人
- This is for your own protection. - Sebastian kills.

379
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,660
闭嘴 听着
Just shut the hell up and listen for a second.

380
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,430
好吧 干掉他们
Fine. Clear them.

381
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,200
-它们通过了第三个检查站 -处理它们 艾克 德尔塔
They passed checkpoint three. Execute, Echo, Delta.

382
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,340
德尔塔队 继续向西移动 艾克在途中
Delta team, keep moving to the west. Echo is en route.

383
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,970
埃斯皮诺萨和我会处理剩下的
Espinosa and I will handle what's left.

384
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,340
外围发生了什么
What happened to the outer perimeter?

385
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,680
-僵尸是怎么到这么近的  -有人没有做他们的工作
- How did the walkers get this close? - Somebody wasn't doing their job.

386
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,100
这里似乎发生了很多事情
Seems to happen a lot around here.

387
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,150
那周的事情...不应该发生
About the other week... That shouldn't have happened.

388
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,320
但我感谢你支持我
But I appreciate you having my back.

389
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,980
是的 你在尽你所能 我明白
Yeah. You're trying to do what you can. I get it.

390
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,950
是的 这里很混乱
Yeah. Shit is upside-down around here.

391
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,490
在这份工作中 我需要像你这样的人 我可以信任的人
In this job, I need people like you, people I can trust.

392
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,250
我不能 对不起 如果你在这里需要我的帮助 我会帮你
I can't. I'm sorry. If you need my help out here, I'm your girl.

393
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,920
但你要我在社区帮你 我做不到
But you want my help back there, that's not for me.

394
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,420
我的女儿和家人永远是第一位的
My daughter and my family will always come first.

395
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,430
我尊重你的想法
I respect that.

396
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,430
如果时机到了 你决定离开
If the time comes and you decide to go

397
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,850
你需要帮助 我会帮你的
and you need help getting out, I got you.

398
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,560
这是德尔塔 艾克倒下了 车辆翻了
This is Delta. Echo is down. Vehicle overturned.

399
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,700
小心 来 干掉它们
Watch it. Come on. Take them out. Take them out.

400
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,890
走
Go.

401
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,120
把你的手给我
Give me your hand.

402
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,080
帮我 不
Help me! No!

403
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,900
我们得走了 长官
TROOPER 2: We got to go, sir.

404
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,610
你想要一杯吗
Would you like one?

405
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,070
对我来说有点早 谢谢
It's a little early for me. Thank you.

406
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,750
你对我的朋友们用了催泪瓦斯
You tear-gassed my friends.

407
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,250
如果他们在那 他们就是无视封锁
If they were there, they were in defiance of lockdown.

408
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,580
这么做有帮助吗
And did it help?

409
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,130
这让士兵在城外的工作更容易了吗
Did it actually make the troopers' jobs easier outside the walls?

410
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,970
我们所做的是为了防患可能发生的事
It was about what could have happened.

411
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,720
是为了安全 一直如此
It was about safety. It always is.

412
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,850
你不在乎这会让你看起来良心有愧
And you don't care that it makes you look guilty?

413
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,890
如果你有一个指控 由美子 就说出来
If you have an accusation, Yumiko, make it.

414
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,320
听着 你真的能坐在那里说
Look. Can you really sit there and say there is

415
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,030
你儿子没有做过他被指控的那些事吗
no way your son did the things he was accused of?

416
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,120
他一直是个叛逆者 这是真的
He's always been something of a renegade, it's true.

417
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,250
但他的祖父和叔叔们也是这样
But his grandfather and uncles were the same way,

418
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,660
随着时间的推移 他们逐渐成熟
and they mellowed over time.

419
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,040
成为人们的领袖
Became leaders of men.

420
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,380
也许他的青春叛逆比大多数人都晚
Maybe he's having his youthful rebellions later than most,

421
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,670
但他不是个凶手
but he's not a murderer.

422
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,880
帕梅拉 我想弄清楚你知道多少
Pamela, I am trying to figure out how much you knew.

423
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,260
保护你可能是我的工作
It might be my job to defend you.

424
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,390
当我的律师和这里最杰出的记者 也是朋友时
How can I talk to my lawyer freely when she's also friends

425
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,310
我如何与她自由交谈
with the most prominent journalist around?

426
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,570
妈妈 我...
Mom, I...

427
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,710
你羞辱了我和你自己
You've humiliated me and yourself.

428
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,550
我告诉过你我不应该来
I told you I shouldn't have come here.

429
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,800
看着我 你和这一切有什么关系
Look at me. What did you have to do with all of this?

430
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,930
没有 妈妈
Nothing, Mom.

431
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,100
听着 那个故事是谎言
Look. That story is a lie.

432
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,810
人们想要有人对此负责 而我很容易成为目标
People, they want someone to blame and I'm an easy target.

433
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,730
你需要告诉我更多 我才能救你
You'll need to tell me more than that for me to save your ass.

434
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,110
我想我们可以互相帮助
I think we can help each other.

435
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,030
-你是谁  -我为兰斯霍恩斯比工作
- And who are you? - I work for Lance Hornsby.

436
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,200
他打着你的招牌在外面追捕我的朋友
He's out there hunting my friends under your flag.

437
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,990
我需要你的帮助来阻止他
I need your help to stop him.

438
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,160
我对此一无所知 而且我看不出 这如何能帮到我
I don't know anything about this. And I don't see how it helps me.

439
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,790
如果你的儿子没有做过他被指控的事情 那么就是别人做了
If your son didn't do the things that he's accused of, someone did.

440
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,170
好了 一切到此结束
Okay, this ends now.

441
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,010
放下你的武器
Drop your weapons.

442
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,340
把枪放下
Guns on the ground. Guns on the ground.

443
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,850
-告诉他们 马上 -放下武器
- Tell them, now. - TROOPER 2: Weapons down.

444
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,100
