1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,830
你必须交代点什么
You need to tell me something.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,500
有个女人  她是首领
There's a woman. She's the leader.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,420
天啊  你们到了
Oh, my God. You made it.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,900
我们在树林里遇到了彼此
We found each other in the woods.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,430
我们不知道你是否还活着
We didn't know if you'd survived.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,950
他告诉我  敌人比我们想象中要多得多
He told me there were a lot more out there than we thought --

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,890
比我们这里的人数多两倍以上
More than twice the force we have in here.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,290
关于这家伙  你说得对
You were right about this one.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,030
他现在是家人了
He is family now.

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,970
我们得立刻出发  康妮还在外面活着
We got to go. Connie's out there, alive.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,140
不
No!

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,030
快看
Look! Look!

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,740
对不起  我只是  不
Sorry. Sorry. I'm just -- No.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,570
不  那边可能有房子
No. It might be a house.

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,360
我们可以躲在里面
We could hide.

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,730
我们得继续跑

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,440
快跑
Go.

18
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,550
我一个人骑马耗时更短
We'll make better time if I ride out on my own.

19
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,360
更多人去的话
It's less risky,

20
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,740
风险更小  还能搜索更多地方
and we're gonna cover more ground with a larger group.

21
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,410
委员会正在制定计划
The Council's working on a plan right now.

22
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,470
康妮可没时间等委员会了
Connie doesn't have time to wait on a committee.

23
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,990
我们何不兼顾快速和安全呢
Well, why don't we split the difference between fast and safe?

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,670
两人一组  我们可以将地图划分为更小的格子
Teams of two. We could divide the map up into smaller grids.

25
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,770
这样能减少风险
It could reduce the risk.

26
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,630
有人看见凯利了吗
Hey. Any of you seen Kelly?

27
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,960
在塔楼转弯吗  不确定
走哪条路
北边

28
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,630
好
Okay.

29
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,050
我搜了整栋房子
I checked the whole house.

30
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,440
我们很安全  这里没人
We're okay. Nobody's here.

31
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,720
你需要...
You need --

32
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,060
你需要...
"You need...

33
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,570
休息一下
some rest."

34
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,520
你好几天没睡了
You haven't slept in days.

35
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,890
我来放哨
"I can keep watch."

36
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,740
我们会找到
"We will find...

37
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,750
你的家
your home."

38
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,730
你睡吧
You...sleep.

39
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,050
不安全

40
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,540
听着
Listen.

41
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,150
休息吧
Rest.

42
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,360
好
Okay.

43
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,020
我再去搜一遍房子

44
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,430
说出他们在哪里
Tell us where they are!

45
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,070
反正我也没事干
My dance card's wide open, man.

46
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,750
我们有一整天时间
We got all day.

47
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,070
看不惯吗
This bother you?

48
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,650
我做过更糟的事
I've done worse.

49
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,200
那你去试试吧
Why don't you take a turn, then?

50
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,440
让他快点开口
Speed things up for me.

51
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,970
好  我来
All right. I'm up.

52
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,560
想得美
Like hell you are!

53
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,930
我们是打算僵在这里  含情脉脉地盯着彼此
Well, are we just gonna stand here staring at each other dreamily

54
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,120
还是直入主题
or are we gonna get to it?

55
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,260
你要是杀了他
Hey, you kill him,

56
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,220
咱俩就没完了
the two of us are gonna have a problem!

57
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,700
我不需要保姆
Don't need a babysitter.

58
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,350
我知道自己在干什么
I know what I'm doing.

59
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,950
告诉他们你朋友们的藏身处
Just give 'em a location, where your friends are hiding.

60
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,390
说了就不用受苦了
You do that, this all goes away.

61
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,570
这
That's, uh...

62
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,050
这真是个好提议
That's a good offer.

63
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,860
或者  听我说
Or -- and hear me out...

64
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,050
你们都去吃屎吧
you all could go eat shit instead.

65
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,300
只是个建议
Just a thought.

66
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,850
这些我都已经做过了
Already gone through these steps.

67
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,830
也许我们可以开始割点肉了
Maybe we start taking pieces.

68
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,000
该做什么你就做吧
You do what you gotta do.

69
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,540
给他一把刀
Give him a knife.

70
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,020
我觉得你还不明白
I don't think you understand.

71
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,470
我是你最好的机会
I'm the best shot you got.

72
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,360
为什么  我们现在是"朋友"了吗
Why? We "Friends" now?

73
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,970
不  不是因为我们是朋友
No. Not 'cause we're friends.

74
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,070
而是因为我拿着刀
'Cause I'm the one holding the knife.

75
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,410
嗯
Yeah.

76
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,290
你的哥们还拿着枪呢
And your buddy's the one holding the gun.

77
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,450
闭嘴
Shut up!

78
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,550
闭嘴  听我说
Shut up and listen to me.

79
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,210
我知道你跟她很亲近
I know you're close to her.

80
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,630
那个首领
The leader.

81
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,200
亲近到知道他们藏在哪里
Close enough to know where they're hidin'.

82
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,380
不必有人死在这里
No one needs to die in here.

83
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,300
所以快说出地点  这样就皆大欢喜了
So just say a location so we can all walk away happy.

84
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,700
去死吧  混...
Go to hell, assho--

85
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,830
地点
Location!

86
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,190
否则我再切一根
Or I take another!

87
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,550
我不能说
I can't!

88
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,630
地点
Location!

89
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,940
-不  求你停下来  -地点
- No! No! Please stop! - Location!

90
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,490
黄房子
Yellow house.

91
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,690
283号公路附近的小镇
Town off the 283.

92
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,900
有天线  有天线  有天线
Antenna. Antenna. Antenna. Antenna.

93
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,330
行了吗
Is that good enough?

94
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,530
我可以去侦察
I can scout it out.

95
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,830
带上一支小队  你们三个都去
Take a squad. Three of you.

96
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,190
看看我们的朋友是不是说了真话
See if our friend speaks truth.

97
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,490
你要我们带他一起去吗
You want us to take him?

98
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,430
你看起来"好极了"

99
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,030
老剃刀

100
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,370
这里还有人

101
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,210
等等  发生了什么
Wait. What happened?

102
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,820
房子里还有人

103
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,150
慢点  我不懂
S-Slow down. I don't understand.

104
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,830
它在墙后面  盯着我

105
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,180
什么
What --

106
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,270
还有人

107
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,990
看着没动静
Looks quiet. No movement.

108
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,850
有两个入口  我们同时进入吗
Two entrances. Breach both?

109
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,090
两人一组  你带上鲍威尔
By twos. You take Powell.

110
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,950
华盛顿  菲施  绕到黄房子后面去
Washington, Fish, go around the back of the yellow house.

111
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,080
那个白痴呢
What about dickhead?

112
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,490
我难道要相信他会保护我吗
Am I supposed to believe he's got my back?

113
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,110
不  那是我的职责
No, that's my job.

114
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,140
永远如此
Always.

115
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,580
没人
Clear!

116
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,360
没人
Clear!

117
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,190
没人
Clear!

118
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,830
没人
Clear!

119
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,030
都没人  卡弗
It's all clear, Carve.

120
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,600
那混蛋耍了我们
That son of a bitch jerked us around.

121
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,120
我们应该留在屋子里  到处看看
We should stay, look around for a bit,

122
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,310
以防有遗漏
so we don't miss nothing.

123
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,980
不  我们先搜查整个小镇
No, we'll search the rest of the town first.

124
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,560
动作要快  动静要小  他们说不定还在附近
Quick and quiet, in case they're still nearby.

125
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,420
你们三个  从北边往里搜
You three, take the north end and work back.

126
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,790
-我们在中间碰头  -明白
- We'll meet you in the middle. - Copy.

127
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,300
A:被困在行尸之中
与它们同行了很多天
没有灯  没有食物  水很少

128
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,540
B:米琼恩告诉我的
A:她在哪里
B:不知道  她出去找人了
我本希望能见到她

129
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,760
A:我们似乎被监视了
B:天色已晚
我们天一亮
就收拾东西出发

130
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,700
你在哪
Where are you?

131
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,000
我爷爷的房子墙里也有这种隔层
My grandfather's house used to have one of these.

132
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,190
我会偷偷往里面塞东西
I'd secretly shove stuff in there.

133
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,080
不好意思  我什么都没看见
I-I'm sorry. I don't see anything.

134
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,910
里面有东西

135
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,780
我相信你看到了某些东西
I'm sure you saw something...

136
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,520
不过
but...

137
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,550
不过你一直没睡
But you haven't slept.

138
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,680
所以也许是
So maybe it's...

139
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,610
嗯  因为
Y-Yeah. 'Cause...

140
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,010
好吧  对不起
Okay, okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

141
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,000
我们再搜一次房子  好吗
You and me, let's give the house another sweep, okay?

142
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,130
我不要待在这里

143
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,700
康妮
Connie!

144
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,100
没人
Clear!

145
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,810
这边
Over here!

146
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,830
还是湿的
They're still wet.

147
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,540
看来他说的是真话
Guess he was telling the truth, then.

148
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,760
我们该搜搜其它房间
We should clear the other rooms.

149
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,390
-没人  -没人
- Clear! - Clear!

150
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,870
没人
Clear!

151
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,120
没人
Clear!

152
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,750
没发现
Nothing.

153
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,950
也许他们从后门走了  我能追踪他们
Maybe they went out the back. I can track them.

154
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,210
你急着走吗
Are you in a hurry to leave?

155
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,180
什么
What?

156
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,620
在刚才的房子里  你希望我们留下
Other building, you wanted to stick around

157
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,280
确保没有遗漏
and make sure we didn't miss anything.

158
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,830
现在你又想走了  你到底想怎样
Now you wanna run right off. Which is it?

159
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,450
听着  我只是想帮忙
Look, man, I'm just trying to help.

160
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,180
但你一直在哔哔
Yet you keep chirpin'.

161
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
好吧  要是跟丢了就怪你  可不怪我
Fine. You lose 'em, it's on you. It ain't on me.

162
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,250
别说了
Stop.

163
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,000
华盛顿  查一下周围
Wash, we need a perimeter check.

164
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,380
可能有人跑了  半公里范围
Possible runners. Half a klick.

165
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
收到  肖
Copy that, Shaw.

166
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,920
听着  我没时间听你们斗嘴
Look. I don't have time for this toddler bullshit.

167
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,600
-听着  -我知道
- Listen -- - I know.

168
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,820
我明白  但我不需要
I understand, but I don't need it.

169
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,540
去搜楼上  确保没有遗漏
Go sift upstairs, make sure we didn't miss anything.

170
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,040
别
Don't.

171
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,700
别做什么
Don't what?

172
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,180
你要么跟我们一边  要么不是
You're either with us or you're not.

173
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,960
你希望我做什么
What do you want me to do?

174
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,670
首先  别惹怒卡弗
For one thing... stop pissing off Carver.

175
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,520
一般都没好下场
Usually don't end well.

176
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,260
快走
Come on.

177
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,960
拜托
Please.

178
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,730
拜托  再
Please. Just a --

179
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,370
再走几步
Just a little bit... more!

180
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,650
凯利
Kelly?

181
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,750
太棒了
Awesome.

182
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,730
需要帮助吗
You need help?

183
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,660
你在想什么呢
What the hell were you thinking?

184
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,960
你该告诉我们你要出来
You should have told us that you were heading out.

185
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,530
过来
Come here.

186
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,080
我没事
I'm fine.

187
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,570
但康妮有事
But Connie's not.

188
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,100
我找到了她的营地
I found her camp.

189
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,750
她跟一个认识米琼恩的人在一起
She's with some guy who knew Michonne.

190
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,620
他们匆忙离开  情况不对劲
They left in a hurry. Something's not right.

191
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,410
她觉得他们被跟踪了
She thought they were being followed.

192
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,030
她在外面
She's out there.

193
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,450
她很害怕
She's scared.

194
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:01,920
她需要我
She needs me.

195
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,860
如果
And if...

196
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,080
如果她出了事
if something happened to her...

197
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,610
不会的  我们会先找到她
No. We're gonna find her first.

198
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,880
对
Yeah.

199
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,010
来  我们走吧
Come on. Let's get movin'.

200
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,940
饿
Hungry!

201
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,270
天啊  康妮
Oh, God. Connie.

202
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,550
来吧  我帮你  来吧
Come on. I got you. Come on.

203
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,510
天啊
Oh, God.

204
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,420
他们跑掉了  不会回来了
They ran. They ain't comin' back here.

205
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,220
什么
What?

206
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,260
仔细想想  你们重创了他们
I mean, think about it. You hit 'em hard.

207
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,270
就算他们人更多  也不会回来了
Even if they get more people, they won't come back here.

208
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,230
这不明智
It's a bad move.

209
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,270
你们在镇上有二十人
You got what? 20 people in your town.

210
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,170
你们有武器  围墙
You got weapons. You got walls.

211
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,970
远远就能看见他们接近
You'd see them coming from a mile away.

212
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,310
相信我  他们跑了
Trust me. They ran.

213
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,640
你这么做是有什么目的吗
Is there a point to any of this?

214
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,460
走吧
Let's go.

215
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,570
这里没人  该走了
There's nothing here. It's time we move on.

216
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,760
不  我们错过了什么
No. We're missing something.

217
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,070
-行  再浪费一个小时  真聪明  -达里尔
- Fine. Let's waste another hour. That's smart. - Daryl --

218
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,350
他蠢到稀里糊涂不是我的错
It's not my fault he's too stupid to pay attention!

219
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,750
哔哔哔
Yeah. Chirp, chirp, chirp.

220
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,390
-够了  -拉倒
- Enough. - Ah, screw that.

221
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,390
这浑球想玩  我就教教他规矩
This dirtbag wants to play, I'll teach him the rules.

222
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,410
我就在这里  动手啊
I'm right here, man. Make a move.

223
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,100
现在不是时候  你也无权下令
This is not the time, and it's not your call to make.

224
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,570
老天啊  肖
Jesus, Shaw.

225
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,520
我们都知道他的真实面目
We both know who he really is deep down.

226
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,210
什么
What?

227
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,410
我当时在场  记得吗
I was there. Remember?

228
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,040
之后
After.

229
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,040
你以为这次会有不同的结果吗
What, you think this is gonna end any different?

230
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,060
所以你是在做什么  守护我吗
So this is what? You looking out for me?

231
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,720
永远如此
Always.

232
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,030
我懂了
Gotcha.

233
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,420
那大火那次呢
And what about the fire?

234
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,880
教皇把我锁在木屋里  放火烧我
When Pope locked me in the cabin and lit it up.

235
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,950
你一定事先知道的
You must have known.

236
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,380
那也是你在守护我吗
Was that you looking out for me, too?

237
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,150
肖  醒醒吧
Shaw. Wake up.

238
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,390
现在的一切都是考验
Everything's a test now.

239
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,090
如果你以为这家伙在乎我们
If you think this guy is ever gonna give a shit about any of us,

240
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,220
你会失败的
you're gonna fail.

241
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,300
他说得对
No, he's right.

242
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,580
我根本不在乎你们
I don't give a shit about any of you.

243
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,610
除了你
Except you.

244
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,670
我为你而来
I'm here for you.

245
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,820
我犯过错  这不是秘密
It's no secret. I made mistakes.

246
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,210
但我现在来了
But I'm here right now.

247
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,040
也许这次我能做得更好  如果你允许的话
Maybe I'd be better at it this time, if you'd let me.

248
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,420
而且教皇令我很害怕
And Pope scares the shit outta me.

249
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,190
我可不想被他用脚踩进火堆里
I don't wanna be face-first in the fire under his boot.

250
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,450
但如果你要我信任他们  我会照做
But if you say trust 'em, I'll trust 'em.

251
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,880
我们在这里浪费足够多时间了
We've wasted enough time here already.

252
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,130
你不是真的要...
Oh, you're not seriously gonna --

253
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,290
该走了
It's time to move on.

254
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,230
好吧  听你的
Sure. Your call.

255
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,530
等等
Hold on.

256
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,130
早说没人了
Told ya.

257
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,150
走哪边
Which way?

258
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,400
我们可以分开  搜索两条路  然后回来
We could split up, check both trails, double back.

259
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,460
暴雨快来了  我们应该聚在一起
Storm's coming. We should stick together.

260
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,960
你来定  你觉得她走了哪边
It's up to you. Which way do you think she went?

261
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,500
那边
That way.

262
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,990
他们把我们引到了这里
They led us here.

263
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,640
我从没见过这么丧失人性的人
I've never seen people this far gone.

264
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,950
把我们像猎物一样驱赶
To herd us, like prey.

265
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,000
但我们不是猎物
But we're not.

266
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,260
我会救你出去
I'm getting you out.

267
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,640
我们会尽力一搏
We'll make a run for it.

268
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,650
拿着
Take this.

269
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,180
不管发生什么
No matter what happens...

270
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,770
你都得一直跑
you have to keep going.

271
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,730
无论有没有我  都别停下
With or without me. Don't stop.

272
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,590
不能回头...
Just keep...

273
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,910
不

274
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,600
不不不  拜托了
No. No, no, no, no, no. Please.

275
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,860
拿着吧
Just take it.

276
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,200
要出去就一起出去

277
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,370
我不会让你放弃

278
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,590
我不知道该怎么解释
I don't know how to explain.

279
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,870
但我没有选择
But I don't have a choice.

280
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,880
我迷失过...很长一段时间
I lost myself... for a long time.

281
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,260
完全迷失了
Off the map.

282
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,910
我
And I, um...

283
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,440
做过一些无法挽回的选择
I made choices that I can't un-choose.

284
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,610
但她给了我第二次机会
But she gave me another chance.

285
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,980
米琼恩
Michonne.

286
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,630
她为我指明了道路
She pointed me back to the road,

287
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,080
而这条路让我找到了你
and somehow that road led right to you.

288
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,510
所以我必须放弃这个机会
So I have to pass on that chance,

289
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,250
不然一切就没意义了

我需要你向我保证

299

你不会回头  不管发生什么

308

他不太健谈

316
