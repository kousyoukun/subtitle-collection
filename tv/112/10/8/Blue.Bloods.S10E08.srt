Mrs. Davis?

3
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:17,040
Uh, yes.

4
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:18,574
Detective Reagan.

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,944
I understand you had an incident
with your ex-husband?

6
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:23,112
Warren and I are separated.

7
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:25,648
I served him with divorce papers
this morning.

8
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:26,849
Okay. So what happened?

9
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:30,687
Uh, he came over, um,
screaming, crying.

10
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,789
I probably shouldn't
have let him in,

11
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:34,824
but I thought I could reason
with him.

12
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,459
Did he put his hands on you?

13
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:38,027
No. No, no, um...

14
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:39,729
But he said there's no way

15
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:42,131
he'd ever let me
tear our family apart.

16

You didn't have
to call the police, Mom.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,307
This is our son, Andrew.
Dad was just upset.

20
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:53,154
Doesn't give him the right
to threaten you guys.

21

I gotta go.

22
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,418
It's gotta be tough on him.

23
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:05,321
It is.

24

I wish it didn't have to be
this way.

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,127
Yeah, I understand.
Um, I also understand

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,363
that, uh,
Children's Services assigned

27
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:15,609
an investigative consultant
to your case, is that right?

28
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:16,899
Uh, yes.

29
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:19,569
He's been incredibly supportive.

00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:20,570
Um...

This is him now.

32
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:27,210
Morning, Detective.

33
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:37,920
Hey, that fits
the description

34
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,889
of the vehicle wanted
in connection

35
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,469
with the double homicide
in the Bronx last night.

36
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:43,426
Good eye.
Run the plate.

Registration's

42
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,391
So write me a ticket
and let me get out of here.

43
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,528
Do me a favor,
lower this rear window.

44
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,199
Now put your hands back
on the wheel, please.

45
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:38,114
What've we got
here, Brandon?

46
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,982
No idea what that is.
TROY: We're gonna need

47
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,317
to search the vehicle.

48
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:42,685
Step out of the car.

49
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,620
Now.

50
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,556
Let's go.

51
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,925
Put your hands
on the car.

52
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:02,605
.38 caliber revolver.

53
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,919
What was the caliber gun used
in those shootings last night?

54
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:06,943
.38-- Put your hands
behind your back.

55
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:09,512
What a coincidence.
I didn't shoot nobody.

56
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,813
Guess we'll find out.

57
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:12,482
Good eye, Janko.

58
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,151
Real good eye.

(handcuffs click)
(sighs) Let's go.

60
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:22,692
(sighs)

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,161
Okay. How did it start?

62
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,597
As a typical noise complaint.

63
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,266
Restaurant manager said
he asked the group in question

64
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,336
to quiet down repeatedly
before calling 911.

65
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,849
And there were calls
from the neighbors

66
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:36,383
about what had spilled out
onto the sidewalk.

67
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,551
GORMLEY: So a pretty
rowdy group

68
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:40,176
that was really
getting out of hand.

69
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:44,046
But also chock-full
of FDNY brass.

70
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:46,916
Responding officers did not have
that information.

71
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:51,687
And when did our guys ascertain
that information?

72
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:54,690
No way to know that,
specifically.

73
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,061
Maybe when they pulled up
and clocked the FDNY badges

74
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,932
and plates on the vehicles
in front of the restaurant?

75
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,767
Could be.

76
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,769
Was exactly.

77
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:09,105
Point being, our guys
did not arrive on the scene

78
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:12,141
with any intent other
than to quell the disturbance.

79
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,410
Yet, somehow,

80
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,114
they managed
to arrest Stan Rourke.

81
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,082
Well, yeah.

82
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:22,785
(laughing): Yeah, well,
that's pretty resourceful,

83
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:24,153
I'll give us that.

84
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,756
Turning a noise complaint
about a retirement racket

85
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:30,760
into collaring
the FDNY commissioner.

86
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:34,430
Boss, all the eyewitnesses said
the exact same thing.

87
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,599
Our guy was appealing
to Commissioner Rourke

88
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:39,135
who responded by laying hands
on our guy.

89
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:42,171
Watch out, Sid, there's
an elephant in the room.

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,806
"Our" guys, "their" guys.

91
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,742
This has been going on
as long as I've been a cop.

92
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,045
Again, boss,
our guys didn't start this.

93
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,280
No, but it just might be

94
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,916
our guys poured gasoline on it.

95
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:00,957
A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

96
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,927
Thanks so much for coming up.

97
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:06,206
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mayor.

98
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,697
Mayor-elect.

99
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,799
Mr. Mayor-elect.

100
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,267
How about just Peter?

101
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:12,368
Peter.

102
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,036
Please.

103
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,178
So, congratulations.

104
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:23,546
Yeah, thanks.

105
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,282
I liked a lot of what you
had to say on the campaign.

106
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,351
Some of which was true...

107
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,286
and some of which
was a combination

108
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:32,788
of pandering
and wishful thinking.

109
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:35,057
And which was which?

110
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,993
Doesn't matter, I got the job.

111
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,462
So now all of it has to be true.

112
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,364
Right.

113
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:44,000
Which is why I've asked you up.

114
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:46,636
Gulp.

115
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:49,338
Nah. It's all good.

116
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,142
I don't like your boss's bent.

117
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:57,013
I didn't know
my boss had a bent.

118
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:59,582
He thinks accused criminals

119
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,318
and their victims
both have equal rights.

120
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,220
They don't have equal rights.

121
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:06,522
They are both protected
under the law.

122
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,891
Yes, and rightly so.

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,127
But he gets lost in the weeds.

124
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,531
I don't think your office
has the trust that it should.

125
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,699
The people's trust?

126
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:17,700
That's our customer.

127
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:18,701
That's who we serve.

128
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,770
Well, we serve the law,
actually.

129
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,371
That, too.

130
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,740
But don't forget the customer.

131
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:30,446
I'd like to support your run
for Manhattan district attorney.

132
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:34,083
I... (chuckles)
I don't have a run.

133
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:35,718
You do now, if you want.

134
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:37,219
With the mayor's backing.

135
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,387
The mayor-elect.

136
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,623
In a month and a half, mayor.

137
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,325
By a landslide.

138
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:45,995
You're gonna get a call
from Sam Terhune.

139
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,764
He's been with me since day one.

140
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,901
Have the coffee, hear him out,
share your concerns.

141
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:55,237
Well, my first concern is that
I am loyal to my office,

142
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:56,706
and you're asking me to...

143
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:59,408
Stay loyal to your office.

144
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:02,445
Mr. Chatwal is not the office.

145
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:05,514
He's just the guy sitting
in it for now.

Decent guy?

160
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:52,990
He just did eight months
in state prison.

161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,228
He ran a nursing home in Queens.
Uh-huh.

He got hooked on pain meds,
Mm-hmm.

00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:01,176
and then he started stealing
the pills from the residents.

164
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,936
Not for nothing, that doesn't
exactly sound like a decent guy.

165
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:07,171
He made a mistake,
he paid for it.

166
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,740
Now he's fighting
to keep his family alive.

167
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,575
Sounds like that
ship already sailed.

168
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:13,377
You know where
I can find him?

169
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:16,113
Yeah. Warren's parole officer
got him a job in a drug rehab.

170
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:17,481
Great. Give me the address,

171
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,717
and I'll drop you off at home
on my way to see him.

172
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:20,885
Fat chance.

173
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:24,255
I'm working this case
same as you.

174
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:26,324
(chuckles)

175
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,594
Okay.

176
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:34,098
(sighs)

177
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,366
Hey.

178
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:37,635
So I go
to this joker's apartment.

179
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:39,770
Turns out he's not
just dating the victim,

180
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,206
he's dating
her sister, too.

181
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,908
Uh-huh.

182
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,844
And the sister, oh,
she's got a full-face tattoo

183
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,413
of the Pope and Mother Teresa
riding a Harley.

184
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,115
Yeah. Got it.

185
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:52,717
You haven't heard
a word I said.

186
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:53,985
What's going on with you?

187
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:56,287
(sighs) Just...

188
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:03,861
I met with Mayor-elect Chase
this morning.

189
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,831
He wants to support me in a run
for the D.A.'s office.

190
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,065
Shut the front door.

191
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:09,066
I know.

192
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:10,067
And what'd you tell him?

193
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,536
Well, I didn't say much
of anything.

194
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:14,338
Well, including "no"?
I listened, mostly.

195
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,540
Yeah, but no "no."
There are a hundred reasons

196
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,342
why this is a bad idea.

197
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:19,443
Yeah. And one good one.

198
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:21,178
'Cause you'd be a kick-ass D.A.

199
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:22,446
Thank you.

200
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:24,048
But if I put my hat in the ring,

201
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:25,916
this whole office
will go upside down.

202
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:28,686
The boss is gonna come after you
with both barrels.

203
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:30,354
Well, I can handle him.
Problem is,

204
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:32,923
he's gonna force everyone
in the building to choose sides.

205
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:34,236
Yeah, well, you have
a hell of a lot more friends

206
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,526
around here than he does.

207
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:37,995
But do I have what it takes
to beat him?

208
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:40,831
Only one way to find out.

209
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,434
Yeah. The hard way.

210
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:55,146
Hey. Nice work out
there this morning.

211
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,814
- Thanks, Sarge. - Oh, thanks.
- That gun

212
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:58,660
you got out of that car
looks good for the murder weapon

213
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,444
used in that double homicide
up in the Bronx.

214
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:01,930
That's great news.
Phelps gets charged

215
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:03,032
for the murders,
could be a commendation in it

216
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:04,188
for both of you.

217
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:06,257
Just happy to take a mutt
like that off the street.

218
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,530
Hey.
Huh?

219
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,065
What?

220
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,199
Nothing.

221
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,901
Something.

222
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,437
We got a bad guy.

223
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:21,772
What could be the matter?

224
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:40,658
Thank you, Lieutenant.

225
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,530
You're gonna pay for this,
you son of a bitch.

226
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,165
No, I'm not.

227
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:51,268
Your guys targeted my racket
to bust our balls!

228
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,170
They responded
to a noise complaint.

229
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:57,007
Instead of dialing it down,
you chose to get belligerent.

230
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,209
That's not how it went down.

231
00:10:58,277 --> 00:11:00,177
That's exactly how it went down.

232
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:01,890
Oh, you can't whitewash this,
Frank-- my guys have

233
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:03,425
the whole thing
on their phones, you know.

234
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:06,117
Yeah, I saw 'em.
You laid hands on my cop.

235
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,651
I stuck my finger in his chest.

236
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,721
You jabbed your finger
in his chest repeatedly.

237
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,772
To make a point!

238
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,658
They had every right
to haul you in.

239
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,459
Because you license your guys
to harass us.

240
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,194
The hell I do.
Oh, come on, Frank,

241
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:19,964
your guys stick it to my guys
every chance they get.

242
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:22,466
NYPD can't stand
that we get all the glory.

243
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,969
Oh, while we grind it out
and do our job.

244
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:26,770
Your guys targeted me.

245
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,172
That's the fact.

246
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:30,174
My guys responded by the book.

247
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:32,743
(taps table)
That's... the fact.

248
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:38,482
I am the commissioner
of the FDNY.

249
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,819
Which is why you weren't cuffed
when we hauled you in here.

250
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,654
Cut the crap, Stan.

251
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:45,689
(slaps paper)

252
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:47,758
Summons for harassment.

253
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:50,060
You're free to go.

254
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,733
You haven't heard
the last of this, Frank.

255
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:58,702
(door slams)

256
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:05,543
You were supposed to call me
before reaching out to Karen.

257
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:08,045
I know.
It's just the, uh...

258
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:10,281
divorce papers, uh,

259
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:11,415
they caught me off guard.

260
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:13,417
Doesn't give you a right
to threaten your family.

261
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,719
You're right.
I lost my head.

262
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,888
You staying clean?
Absolutely.

263
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:20,391
Warren's P.O. says
he's been the model parolee.

264
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,793
Well, I'm sure his soon-to-be
ex-wife would say different.

265
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,142
Well, I put Karen through a lot.

266
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,030
I don't blame her
if she gives up on me.

267
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:27,765
So why the meltdown today?

268
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,233
Look...

269
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,604
I can live
with losing my marriage,

270
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,973
but not my son--
he means everything to me.

271
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,276
You gonna tell
my parole officer?

272
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:40,411
What do you think?

273
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,979
No one got hurt.

274
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,115
(sighs)

275
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:50,421
Fine.

276
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,423
I won't tell him this time.

277
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:53,958
But no more shenanigans.

278
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,793
You've got my word.

279
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:01,098
Thank you.

280
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,866
What was that?
What was what?

281
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:04,568
You guys were
acting all chummy.

282
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,870
You acted like more of a
social worker than a cop.

283
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:09,340
I'm not here as a cop.
My job is to get

284
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:11,494
the best possible outcome
for this family.

285
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,311
(sighs) Well, my job is
to enforce the law.

286
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,683
You've gone over
that arrest report

287
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:21,785
a dozen times.

288
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,787
Troy asks the suspect
to lower the rear window,

289
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:26,323
and there was a single vial
right there on the seat.

290
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:27,758
So?

291
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:30,494
No drugs on him
or anywhere else in the car.

292
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,496
Again, so?

293
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:34,131
So it's pretty convenient.

294
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,102
Drug dealers have been known
to carry drugs, Jamie.

295
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,137
In plain view on the back seat?

296
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:42,873
So he was careless.

297
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:46,176
And we did find a gun
that killed two people.

298
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,711
So there's that.

299
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,748
When Troy reached in the car, he
turned so that his body camera

300
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,082
faced away from the vehicle.

301
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:53,617
Are you sure
you didn't see anything?

302
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:57,021
I saw Troy reaching in the back
and pulling out a vial,

303
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,623
and that gave us cause
to search a vehicle

304
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,725
that had a gun under the seat

305
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:04,261
that was used
in a double homicide.

306
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,298
That's all you saw?

307
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,801
With these two eyes, yes.

308
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,936
Okay, pretend
it's two years ago.

309
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:15,506
You and I are still riding
together as partners,

310
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:17,107
both of us on that scene.

311
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:19,209
What else might one of us
have noticed?

312
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:22,314
(sighs)

313
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,381
If Troy played fast
and loose with this,

314
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,550
it's gonna come out.
How?

315
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:28,263
Because if I can't get
to the bottom of it,

316
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,420
I have to make a phone call.

317
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:33,057
Wha...
Whoa, you're gonna call IAB?

318
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,692
If I suspect
a collar is bad, Eddie,

319
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,794
it is my job to call IAB.

320
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:38,095
Even if it
lets a perp walk?

321
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,531
And jams me up in the process?

322
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,839
You'll be just fine.
And so will

323
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,200
the perp.

324
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,903
Fine and dandy
out on the street.

325
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,708
I can't look the other way
on this.

WARREN: You are<i>not</i> (siren wailing)
going to take him, okay?

328
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,728
Calm down, for God's sake.
I did everything

329
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:01,973
I was supposed to do!
Calm down, Warren.

330

Hey! Hey, hey! Settle down!
Why are you doing this?

Settle down!

DANNY: What the hell

334
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:09,137
is going on here?

335
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:12,139
Karen got a job offer in L.A.

336
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,908
She told Andrew,
who texted his dad.

337
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:16,009
I'm sorry, Warren.

338

I didn't want you
to find out like this.

You're not taking my son!

Hey! Hey!
(cries out)

341
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,217
Dad! Please! Don't hurt him.
It's okay. Nobody's gonna hurt him.

00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,084
(grunts)

343
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:25,652
Let me talk to him.
No, no.

344
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,688
We're done talking.
Get him out of here.

345
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:32,626
Get him out of here.
Come on.

346
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:35,229
It's okay, Andy. It's okay.

347
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:37,464
Go.
It's okay.

348
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,099
It's okay, Andy.
It's okay, Andy.

352
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,632
I gave you a break,

353
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:57,568
but you just couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

354
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:00,037
I needed to talk to Karen.

355
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,305
You call that talking?

356
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:04,642
Look, you have to put yourself
in my place.

357
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,342
She's trying to drag my son
across the country.

358
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,582
Well, even if a judge allows that,
you-you get yourself a lawyer,

359
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:14,552
you work out a custody situation
that you can live with.

360
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:16,954
I'm a convicted felon.

361
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:19,223
What kind of custody deal
am I gonna get?

362
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,059
I don't know. But that's
the least of your worries <i>now.</i>

363
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:27,231
Do you think they're
gonna send me back to jail?

364
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,367
Well, you sure as hell
would deserve it.

365
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,240
What's going on?

366
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,676
Got Warren's
desk appearance ticket.

367
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,149
That mutt deserves
to stay locked up

368
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,185
until his parole
violation hearing.

369
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,486
Disagree.
He's an ex-con

370
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:51,456
with a drug problem who
threatened his family, and now

371
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,102
he just bought himself
an order of protection.

372
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,292
He screwed up.

373
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,957
Now he's trying
to set things right.

374
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,197
Okay, but you can't go ballistic
every time you get a bad break.

375
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,465
(chuckles):
Look who's talking.

376
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,367
(quietly):
This guy is not a perp.

377
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:06,437
He's trying to save his family.

378
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:12,910
Cut him loose.

379
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:17,148
You take one step out of line,
I'm gonna be there,

380
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:18,883
and I'm gonna bust your ass!

381
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:29,994
Thank you.

382
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,131
The arresting officer,
Bruce Zarrelli,

383
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,967
is an 11-year veteran

384
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,035
with a clean and
solid record.

385
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,403
There you go.

386
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,606
Except for being named
in a complaint

387
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,975
a couple of years back
in a brawl

388
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,644
between NYPD officers
and firefighters

389
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:48,246
that broke out in
the emergency room

390
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,047
where they were being treated
at St. Luke's.

391
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:51,215
What are the chances?

392
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:52,517
Of what?
Well,

393
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:56,521
another run-in with the FDNY
out of 35,000 cops?

394
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,523
Zarrelli also coaches
youth hockey

395
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,158
for the Police Sports League's
program.

396
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:03,394
He gives back. See?

397
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:04,962
And?

398
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:10,001
<i>And</i> plays as a defenseman
for the NYPD's hockey squad.

399
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:12,937
And?

400
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:15,606
In three of the last five

401
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:18,643
NYPD-versus-FDNY
annual hockey games,

402
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:22,013
he's been ejected
for misconduct.

403
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,147
For fighting.

404
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:27,985
(laughs): It's hockey;
it's a contact sport.

405
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:30,187
This supports Rourke's claim
that he was singled out.

406
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:31,822
Rourke laid on hands,
not our guy.

407
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:32,990
The collar was solid.

408
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,503
That's not how it's
gonna read in the papers.

409
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,928
Any way you slice it,
Rourke still messed up.

410
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:39,363
Any way you slice it, so did we.

411
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,634
(sighs)

412
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,570
Mayor Chase and I
only met yesterday.

413
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,238
He thought it went well.

414
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:48,739
He gave a review?

415
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,207
You confirmed his opinion of you

416
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,976
based on our research,
that's all.

417
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,711
- Oh.
- If it seems like he flies

418
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,613
by the seat of his pants,
he doesn't.

419
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:56,305
No, I...

420
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,210
He just finds it useful
to give that impression.

421
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:03,120
I haven't made a decision.

422
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:04,589
It's been a day.
I'd hope not.

423
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,991
Right.

424
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,125
(smacks lips)

425
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,660
So why am I here?

426
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,762
Because Peter Chase thinks
you'd make a great D.A.,

427
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:13,798
and I've been in the room
since day one.

428
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,033
What is day one, by the way?
First store he opened.

429
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:17,742
While he was cutting
the ribbon out front,

430
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:20,504
I was out back still duking
it out with the Teamsters boss.

431
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:23,240
And your research on me,
what does it say?

432
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,709
Top of the waves?

433
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:27,211
A lot of positives
with one big unknown.

434
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,546
What is that?

435
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:30,381
Do you want it and how badly.

436
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,849
I don't know that yet.

437
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:32,918
I knew that

438
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,619
from the moment we shook hands.

439
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,389
Do you have any advice for me?

440
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,924
What kind?

441
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,826
What kinds are there?
It boils down

442
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,872
to what you want to hear
and what you need to hear.

443
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,429
(sighs):
Okay.

444
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,498
What I need to hear.

445
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:50,968
I'm a car guy.

446
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:53,838
Family and friends, they come
to me when it's that time.

447
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:55,706
One thing I always tell them...

448
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,208
Okay?

449
00:19:57,276 --> 00:20:00,244
Never buy the first year
of a new model's production.

450
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:03,347
Wait at least
until the second cycle.

451
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,083
I've got a car I like.

452
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:07,485
Exactly.

453
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:09,987
You've got a good job
and one you excel in.

454
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:12,723
Peter Chase as mayor
is still a month and a half

455
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,125
from the showroom floor.

456
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,693
You'd be buying into something

457
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:18,796
no one's had the chance
to even drive around the block.

458
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,002
You're in early.

459
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,737
Got a call from IAB.

460
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:28,305
I figured you would.

461
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:30,174
They're investigating
the Phelps collar.

462
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:31,542
I'm getting called in.

463
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:33,511
Like I said, just
tell the truth.

464
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,179
The truth is

465
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:37,515
that a really bad guy's
off the streets.

466
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,517
But that's the
result, Eddie.

467
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,585
The question is
how it went down.

468
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,354
I don't want
to jam anybody up.

469
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:44,722
I get that. But
if the evidence

470
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,891
that allowed Troy to search
that car was planted...

471
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,427
I don't know that it was,
and neither do you.

472
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:52,163
You don't know,
but you have doubts.

473
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:55,199
What I have is
my partner's back.

474
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:56,434
Just like I had yours.

475
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,502
The difference is I
never crossed the line.

476
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,439
Kenneth Troy is a good cop.
Even good cops screw up.

477
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,941
So we're just gonna
let him hang out to dry?

478
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,644
If Troy broke the law, then
he needs to answer for that,

479
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,679
same as the alleged
shooter that you collared.

480
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,147
Well, no, it's not the same.

481
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:11,849
Phelps is a murderer.

482
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:15,119
And Troy has given his life
to this department.

483
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:16,654
You're right.
It's not the same.

484
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:17,955
Troy's worse.

485
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:20,458
Well, how do you figure that?

486
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:21,859
Because he took an oath.

487
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,228
Because when you put on the
uniform, you ask the public

488
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:26,464
to entrust you with
upholding the law,

489
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,733
so you should know better.

490
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:32,870
The same goes for anyone
who covers for him.

491
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,911
(clears throat)

492
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,680
Detective Reagan,
what are you doing here?

493
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:44,381
I could ask you
the same thing.

494
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,950
You do realize
you're in violation

495
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:47,418
of the order of
protection, correct?

496
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:49,754
No, no, no. I got a message
from Karen at work,

497
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,288
and she asked me
to come over.

498
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:52,423
I'm sure she did.

499
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:54,391
I'm serious.
You got to believe me.

500
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,604
Doesn't matter what I believe.

501
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:56,828
You're under arrest. Let's go.

502
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:57,928
Hands against the car.

503
00:21:57,997 --> 00:21:59,096
What are you...?
Just go.

504
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:01,132
Right now!

505
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:08,773
Turn around.

506
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,841
Stay right here.

507
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:15,746
Let me guess. You just happened
to be in the neighborhood?

508
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:18,816
Warren texted me,
said Karen wanted to meet.

509
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:22,119
I called Karen,
she knew nothing about it.

510
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:24,588
Yeah, sounds like
your boy made it up.

511
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,023
Or someone sent a fake message

512
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:28,425
so he'd violate
his order of protection.

513
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:29,774
Well, that sounds like something

514
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:31,629
<i>you'd</i> probably do
back in your glory days.

515
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:33,030
More than once.

516
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:35,199
But setting people up
is the kind of thing

517
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:36,600
you can get busted for.

518
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,602
Is that a threat?

519
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,205
You take him in based
on a fixed setup?

520
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:43,240
It's a promise.

521
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,309
(chuckles)

522
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,580
Okay.

523
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:51,949
But if he kills his wife,
it's on you.

524
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:55,553
Get the hell out of here. <i>Now!</i>

525
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:57,254
Stay away.

526
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:01,158
(car door closes)

527
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,110
When?

528
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,656
GORMLEY: About an hour
and a half ago.

529
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,648
Apparently, both our guys and
their guys started jawboning

530
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:12,718
at each other, but the
bosses on scene got ahold

531
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:14,286
before anything physical
started.

532
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:16,588
And we can assume
that the cell phones were out

533
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:19,625
and that the jawboning'll be
all bleeps on the 5:00 news.

534
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:21,584
I got nothing but bleeps
for this right now.

535
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,695
BAKER: But they were able

536
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:24,870
to secure the scene together
without any real incident?

537
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:25,665
Yes.

538
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,266
Yeah. This time.

539
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:30,736
Look, walk down the street,

540
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:33,105
and ask anyone the name
of the police commissioner

541
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:35,040
and the fire commissioner,
what do you get?

542
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,109
BAKER:
"Frank Reagan,"

543
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:37,143
and, "I don't know."

544
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:38,744
Exactly. Look,
I'd have a chip

545
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:41,480
on my shoulder, too, if I was
"Commissioner I Don't Know."

546
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:43,482
So would any of you.
So what?

547
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,817
Well, Lieutenant, we are going

548
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:49,988
to do something about this thing
with our guys and their guys

549
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:52,791
before it spills out
onto the street.

550
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,761
Okay, but what about our guy?
Our hockey player?

551
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:57,763
Yeah. We gonna just let him
hang out to dry?

552
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,998
This tradition--

553
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:03,835
I know the rank and file likes
to play it on both sides--

554
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,704
but I got nothing for it.

555
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:07,839
So... what?

556
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:10,208
We ask him
to take one for the team.

557
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:12,010
JAMIE:
<i>You've been</i>

558
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,578
interviewed
with IAB before.

559
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:16,615
Yeah, but not with my
partner's career on the line.

560
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:18,984
You should be worried
about your own career here.

561
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:21,186
I have you to
thank for that.

562
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:22,654
I did my job, Eddie.

563
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:24,356
And it could cost me mine.

564
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:26,024
IAB is looking
at Troy, not you.

565
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:27,859
Like that matters.
Of course it matters.

566
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:31,163
Really? I tell IAB the truth--
I didn't see anything--

567
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:34,166
and Troy still goes down,
I come out smelling like a rat.

568
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:37,169
Maybe to a few knuckleheads.

569
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:42,274
Troy has been in that
precinct for 12 years, Jamie.

570
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:45,010
If he loses his shield,
they're gonna blame that on me.

571
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,611
I did not create
the situation, Eddie.

572
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,013
I did not plant that evidence.

573
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:50,482
You just called IAB.

574
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,391
(door opens)

575
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,892
(sets cup down)

576
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:02,461
(door closes)

577
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:06,531
Hey.

578
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,899
Hey.

579
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,873
Is everything all right?

580
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:18,076
Yeah, just...
work stuff.

581
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:20,612
Work stuff about
you running for D.A.?

582
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:24,049
How did you find out?

583
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:25,250
(laughs)

584
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,918
Hey, I know guys who know guys.

585
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:29,654
I thought it was
supposed to be confidential.

586
00:25:29,723 --> 00:25:31,056
Well, by normal
standards, it is,

587
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,326
but one guy knew one
other guy who knew.

588
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,930
(sighs) I wanted to come
to you with it right away.

589
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,233
But you didn't.

590
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,235
I just felt like
it was a decision

591
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:44,770
I should make on my own.

592
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:47,773
And I respect that.

593
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:52,277
I've wanted this my whole life.

594
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:53,912
Actually, you wanted
to be a jockey

595
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,747
till you were nine years old.

596
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:57,749
Well, I was already
five-seven by then.

597
00:25:57,818 --> 00:25:59,117
And allergic to horses.

598
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:03,088
Okay, I have wanted this
my entire <i>adult</i> life.

599
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:07,159
And it's past time
that Manhattan has a female D.A.

600
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:10,128
Well, I think
you'd make a great one.

601
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:11,763
Nothing to do with gender.

602
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:13,799
Thank you.

603
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,867
Yeah.

604
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:19,437
Something to think about.

605
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:21,306
It is

606
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,009
definitely gonna
turn up the heat around here.

607
00:26:24,077 --> 00:26:26,111
I thought you and I have done
a good job

608
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,647
checking our guns at the door
since I became bureau chief.

609
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:30,482
Yes,

610
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:32,651
but there is the rest
of the family.

611
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,254
What do you mean?

612
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:38,623
Well, they've lived
in the public eye

613
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:40,592
for as long as I can remember,

614
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:42,661
but you choose to stand

615
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:44,663
for public office.

616
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:48,934
The scrutiny will go
through the roof. I know.

617
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,503
Look, it's your decision,

618
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:53,572
as it should be.

619
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:57,142
We'll support what you do.

620
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:02,147
JANKO:
<i>Wow.</i>

621
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:03,982
- District attorney.
- Oh! - All right, Erin.

622
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,184
(overlapping chatter)

623
00:27:06,253 --> 00:27:07,819
Look at you.
I appreciate the support,

624
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:10,021
but I haven't made
a decision yet.

625
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,301
Well, what the heck
are you waiting for?

626
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:12,691
It's a job
you were born to do.

627
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,317
HENRY: Yeah.

628
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,927
Be nice to have a friend
to cops in that office.

629
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:16,428
For once.

630
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:18,830
It's a complicated
decision for all of us.

631
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,532
What do you mean,
all of us?

632
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,500
Well...

633
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:24,636
a lot of hard
questions get asked,

634
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:26,838
and the answers get checked
and double-checked.

635
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:29,541
Folks sticking their noses
where they don't belong.

636
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,844
And nothing's out of bounds,
and I mean nothing.

637
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:34,813
Yeah, but we've all dealt
with the press before.

638
00:27:34,882 --> 00:27:36,882
It's not the press.
They're at least visible.

639
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,683
It's the opposition research,

640
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:40,218
stuff on any
and all of us

641
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,520
that can just surface
out of nowhere.

642
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:44,067
So, you're telling me
that the Russians

643
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:46,057
are gonna be making
stuff up about me online?

644
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:49,327
I doubt it, but before
I make a decision,

645
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:52,464
I would like to know
that you guys are all on board.

646
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:53,899
- 100%.
JANKO: Yeah. - Yeah.

647
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,000
Of course.
JANKO: Yeah.

648
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:56,201
On board.
And if there's

649
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,936
anything I should know,

650
00:27:58,005 --> 00:27:59,771
anything that could
raise a red flag,

651
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,506
now would be the time.

652
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:05,043
You mean like my dad
being a convicted felon?

653
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:07,145
Well, that's already
out in the open.

654
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:08,647
Could it hurt you?

655
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:09,748
I doubt it.

656
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,317
And that's on him, not on you.

657
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:12,946
Yeah.

658
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,420
I got accused
of roughing up a clown

659
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:16,855
who doused some cops with water,
which made all the news.

660
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:19,224
Well, that guy only got half
of what he had coming to him.

661
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,392
And again, it's known.

662
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,127
HENRY:
Yeah.

663
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,362
Cat got your tongue?

664
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:26,731
I'm thinking.

665
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,999
This may take a while.

666
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:29,534
Well, you all know

667
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:32,370
I may have stepped on the line
once or twice in my career.

668
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,706
And Dillinger robbed a bank
one or two times.

669
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:36,875
Hey, I'll stack Danny's record

670
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:38,476
against any detective
on the job.

671
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:39,644
Thank you, Dad.
Mm.

672
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:41,413
And I have a clear conscience
about it,

673
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:43,248
so I say you should go for it.

674
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:46,418
Grandpa, anything I should know?

675
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:47,786
I'll take the Fifth.

676
00:28:47,854 --> 00:28:48,887
FRANK: Hmm.
Oh.

677
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:50,355
Does a fake I.D. count?

678
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:51,356
What?

679
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,091
I think you're okay.

680
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,026
Hopefully, yours is better
than your dad's.

681
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:56,861
- What? - Oh.
JAMIE: Yeah. What was

682
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,930
the name on that thing?
"Marion Morrison."

683
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,299
ALL:
Marion?

684
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:02,500
JANKO:
Seriously?

685
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:04,269
It's John Wayne's name
in real life.

686
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:05,470
Who?

687
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:07,739
That's sad.

688
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:09,574
And if those are the only

689
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:11,409
skeletons in the
closet, you know what?

690
00:29:11,478 --> 00:29:14,145
I'd say you're good to go.

691
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:16,381
DANNY:
Yeah.

692
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,382
Yes.
HENRY: Good to go.

693
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,883
Do it.
Thank you, everyone.

694
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:20,485
Pass the potatoes, Marion.

695
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:23,421
(laughter)

696
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,091
DANNY:
Well, Gramps,

697
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,394
I sure hope your boy Davis
is behaving himself.

698
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,296
I'll take his behavior
over yours.

699
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,299
Wait for me in the car.

700
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:40,138
Do you mind telling me
what happened to Henry Reagan?

701
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:42,407
'Cause this bleeding heart
I've been riding

702
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,843
around with the last few days--
I have no idea who he is.

703
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:47,145
Domestic violence cases
are loaded with landmines.

704
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,346
Uh-huh.

705
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:50,348
You got to walk softly.

706
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:51,616
Well, I know that, Gramps.

707
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:53,118
That's exactly my point.

708
00:29:53,186 --> 00:29:54,953
You know, this isn't
my first rodeo.

709
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:57,489
Problem is, you're acting like
the bull and not the rider.

710
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:59,324
But if this guy Davis
goes off on his wife,

711
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:00,525
he could do serious damage.

712
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:02,160
He's never hurt
anyone in his life.

713
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,095
But if he goes
back to jail,

714
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,864
it'll do some real damage
to his son.

715
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:07,510
Well, I think he should have
thought about that

716
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:08,700
before he became a junkie.

717
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:10,268
Look, Gramps,

718
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:12,604
I became a cop in
the first place because of you

719
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:14,472
and the stories you told
about the old days

720
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,952
when cops didn't look
over their shoulders,

721
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:17,709
and they did
what they had to do.

722
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,544
Watching you work this case
makes me wish

723
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:22,180
I'd kept those stories
to myself.

724
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,452
Well, if that's how you feel,

725
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,454
I'll ride solo on the Davis case
from here on in.

726
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,189
I'll do the same.
Good.

727
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,826
(door closes)

728
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:40,859
Detective Reagan?

729
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:43,627
(crying):
This is all my fault.

730
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:45,696
What-what happened?
What's your fault?

731
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:47,865
I went to pick up Andrew
from soccer practice,

732
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:50,501
and his coach said that
Warren had already taken him.

733
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,969
Taken him where?
I don't know.

734
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:53,348
And I've been calling
their cell phones,

735
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:54,850
and neither one of them
is picking up.

736
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:56,819
Well, didn't the teachers know
about the order of protection?

737
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:59,003
Well, with everything going on,
I didn't have a chance.

738
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:00,578
I can't believe
this is happening.

739
00:31:00,646 --> 00:31:02,291
Wait a minute. Wait.
It's not your fault, okay?

740
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:03,848
What I need you to do
is take a breath.

741
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,928
All right? I'm gonna have this
officer take your complaint.

742
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:08,118
I promise you I'll find him.

743
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,121
Go ahead.
Right this way.

744
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:15,960
You heard?

745
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:17,695
Yeah.
You know,

746
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,797
if he was locked up
like I wanted him to be,

747
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:21,298
this would never
have happened.

748
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,300
And he wouldn't keep
acting like a perp

749
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,236
if you didn't keep
treating him like one.

750
00:31:25,304 --> 00:31:27,304
(chuckles) So you're
saying this is my fault?

751
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:30,608
What I'm saying is this guy
is not who you think he is.

752
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:31,854
I don't give a damn who he is.

753
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:33,344
I got to go find this guy

754
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:35,913
a-and the son that
he just kidnapped!

755
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:37,581
I know where they are.
You...

756
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,049
(exhales)

757
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,985
Well, do you plan on telling me?

758
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:42,653
Oh, I thought
we were going solo.

759
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:45,222
(whispers):
Oh, my God, Gramps.

760
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,690
You drive.

761
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,759
Gladly.

762
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:54,698
Ever go as Beyoncé
for Halloween?

763
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:57,001
Blackface.

764
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:58,002
Uh, no.

765
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,403
Run around topless

766
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:01,238
at Burning Man?
Anything like that?

767
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,173
No, I like to wear clothes
in public.

768
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:04,575
It's kind of my thing.

769
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,844
Your ex-husband have any beefs
he's been waiting to air?

770
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:09,246
We've aired them all, so no.

771
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:10,781
Daughter Nicky, any skeletons?

772
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,983
Not that I know of.
This is all about

773
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:14,485
what you do know of.

774
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:16,153
You can't prevent surprises.

775
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:17,988
You can only anticipate them.

776
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:20,157
Right.

777
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:22,593
A run for anything these days
is like a daily colonoscopy.

778
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:25,262
But the model I made
from researching you

779
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:26,597
is the best kind.

780
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,332
Between your personal conduct

781
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:30,134
and the record of service
in your family,

782
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:33,003
there are offsets for almost any
situation that could rear up.

783
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:34,672
That's good.

784
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,141
Depends on
what you're looking for.

785
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:38,609
What does that mean?

786
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:40,744
Means if you're looking
at the scrutiny

787
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:43,414
as an excuse
not to pursue the office,

788
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:46,016
the scrutiny ain't much of one.

789
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:49,153
Who said I was looking
for an excuse?

790
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:54,158
Isn't that
what you're doing here?

791
00:32:58,331 --> 00:33:00,431
You wanted
to see me, Sarge?

792
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,299
Yeah.

793
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:03,901
How you holding up?

794
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,036
You mean
the IAB dog and pony?

795
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:07,805
Yeah.
Yeah. It's no problem.

796
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:09,440
How long you been
on the job now?

797
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:10,574
19 years.

798
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:11,909
That's a damn good run.

799
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:13,243
You should be proud.

800
00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:15,245
Thank you, sir.

801
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:16,981
Some guys,

802
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:19,516
they don't know
when to hang it up.

803
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:22,486
You don't seem like
that kind of guy.

804
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,490
I guess.

805
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:30,961
(door closes)

806
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,699
The job takes its toll.

807
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:37,635
I've heard of seasoned cops
throwing procedure

808
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:40,504
out the window
to take down a perp.

809
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:42,206
Oh, yeah?

810
00:33:42,274 --> 00:33:44,408
Yeah, and jamming up
their partners in the process.

811
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:47,478
Look, I... I don't know
what Janko told you,

812
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:48,846
but I didn't do anything wrong.

813
00:33:48,914 --> 00:33:50,114
Janko didn't tell me anything.

814
00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:51,615
She didn't need to.

815
00:33:51,684 --> 00:33:53,662
A cadet could look at that
collar and know something

816
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:54,952
wasn't right.
Yeah, but IAB's

817
00:33:55,021 --> 00:33:56,920
still got to prove it, right?
And if they do,

818
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:59,023
your partner catches the blame.

819
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:01,358
Sarge, chances are
Phelps killed two people.

820
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:02,359
Mm-hmm.

821
00:34:02,428 --> 00:34:03,761
Probably more before that.

822
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:05,162
Now he's off the street.

823
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,231
Which doesn't justify
what you did.

824
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:11,235
And IAB's gonna
take your shield for it.

825
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:13,103
But there's a way out.

826
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:14,571
What is that?

827
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,440
You put your papers in. Today.

828
00:34:16,509 --> 00:34:17,841
No way. No way.

829
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,443
I'm not quitting.
Suit yourself.

830
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:22,312
But if you go down for this,
they'll take your pension.

831
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:25,282
You walk on your own,
you can keep it.

832
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:27,518
And your reputation.

833
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,626
All right, can I have some time
to think about this?

834
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:37,661
You got the time it takes
to get to that door.

835
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:45,402
All right, I'll...

836
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:48,505
put my papers in
by the end of the day.

837
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:00,918
(door closes)

838
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,359
Those the two
you're looking for?

839
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:11,328
Yeah, that's them.

840
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,833
How'd you know
he'd bring him here?

841
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:18,836
Warren told me that the best
memory he had of his old man

842
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:20,037
was coming to the Garden

843
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:22,339
and he was sorry that he
never brought Andrew.

844
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:27,511
Guess you were right about
all that touchy-feely stuff.

845
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,546
Go figure.

846
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:31,215
You want me to pull
'em from their seats?

847
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,184
You're the cop.

848
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:35,452
(sighs)

849
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,620
Nah.

850
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:38,689
Let 'em enjoy
the game.

851
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:41,625
I'll call the mom
and let her know the kid's okay.

852
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,538
But do you think you could
score us a couple of seats

853
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:44,962
so we can keep
an eye on 'em?

854
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,564
No problem.
Thanks.

855
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:53,337
Sometimes there
is no bad guy.

856
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:56,607
I should've listened to you.

857
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:59,409
I'm... sorry I didn't.

858
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:00,944
Talk's cheap.

859
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:06,250
Two dogs,

860
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:08,685
fries and a
beer, right?

861
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:10,521
Don't forget the Red Vines.

862
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:13,056
Right.

863
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,659
(chuckles softly)

864
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:18,629
♪ ♪

865
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:22,233
Hey.

866
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:23,534
Hey yourself.

867
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,437
Troy put in his papers today.

868
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:29,339
Yeah. So I hear.

869
00:36:29,408 --> 00:36:31,875
Lets me off the hook
in a big way.

870
00:36:31,944 --> 00:36:33,577
Yeah, you caught a nice break.

871
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:35,913
How'd you do it?

872
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:37,915
(exhales)
What are you talking about?

873
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:42,619
I just laid out the facts.

874
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:44,254
Troy made his own decision.

875
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:46,657
And likely saved my career
in the process.

876
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:48,625
Thanks to you.

877
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:50,027
Yeah, well,
I put you in the fire,

878
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:51,929
so least I could do
was pull you back out.

879
00:36:51,997 --> 00:36:55,899
Mm. It was a tough situation
all around.

880
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:58,168
99 times out of 100,

881
00:36:58,237 --> 00:36:59,770
I go by the book.

882
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,606
I make that call to IAB.
I know.

883
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:05,576
Well, but the trouble is you're
the one time that I shouldn't.

884
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:08,478
You did what you thought
was right.

885
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:09,591
Yeah, but that's
not good enough.

886
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:11,682
Not when it comes to you.

887
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,050
I messed up.

888
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:15,586
I'm sorry.

889
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:17,988
In the end,

890
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:21,658
you had my back,
like you always do.

891
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:26,096
We knew working together
was not gonna be easy.

892
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:28,232
Yeah, but family comes first.

893
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,833
You come first.

894
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:32,502
I never doubted that.

895
00:37:38,844 --> 00:37:40,777
ANNIE:
Um, I-I have...

896
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:41,945
(footsteps approaching)

897
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:43,014
Hi.

898
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:44,648
I really was in
the neighborhood.

899
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:46,483
Had a meeting with the D.A.

900
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:48,252
How'd that go?

901
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,120
(chuckles):
Oh, I don't think he likes me.

902
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:51,466
What makes you say that?
(door closes)

903
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,756
He did that thing they do

904
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:54,803
where they compare an
entrepreneur in elected office

905
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:58,629
to calling an auto mechanic
to do your hip replacement.

906
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:01,598
You know, I'm not
a professional politician.

907
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,466
He said that?

908
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:03,600
In so many words.

909
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:04,835
So, not in those words--

910
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:06,864
just close enough
that you could bend it that way?

911
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:11,975
Mm.

912
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:15,445
My wife Vanessa and our boys,
Gavin and Julian.

913
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,614
Beautiful family.

914
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:19,082
Second wife.

915
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:21,418
Married 15 years.

916
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:24,054
Made all my mistakes
first time around.

917
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:26,456
And you're telling me that why?

918
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:29,293
My interest in you

919
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:32,863
is purely collegial
and will never be anything but.

920
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:35,532
It's important, in this climate,

921
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:36,967
to get that out in the open.

922
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:40,370
Plus, it's the truth.

923
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,139
I believe you.

924
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:45,242
Good. You should.

925
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:48,712
I don't have a decision.

926
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:50,514
I don't have a deadline.

927
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:52,616
I'm gonna wait
until after you're sworn in.

928
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:54,551
If I did have a deadline,

929
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,219
that would be past it.

930
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:58,889
Are either
of the other two prosecutors

931
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:02,559
that you've approached aware
that you're playing the field?

932
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:06,430
That hasn't come up in any
of my conversations,

933
00:39:06,498 --> 00:39:08,065
including the one
I had with you.

934
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,232
How do you know?

935
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:12,502
I know guys who know guys.

936
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:15,505
Course you do.

937
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:18,241
So let's be really clear.

938
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,411
I like you for this,

939
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,146
and I'm guessing
you've rehearsed

940
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:26,350
a D.A.'s version of an
Oscar acceptance speech

941
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:29,286
in front of a mirror
more than once.

942
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,757
The people I believe in,

943
00:39:33,826 --> 00:39:36,093
I don't pave the way.

944
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:39,629
I throw as many obstacles
as I can <i>in</i> the way,

945
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:42,099
see if they got
what I think they do.

946
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:45,669
Understood.

947
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:48,472
See you.

948
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,141
I hope.

949
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,215
Uh, I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out.

950
00:39:58,283 --> 00:40:00,751
Always happy to celebrate
my birthday

951
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:03,553
with my fellow FDNY brothers

952
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:05,622
and sisters.

953
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,758
Let's hope the judge
goes easy on me.

954
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:08,925

00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:30,113
Sorry to say I'm
getting used to it.

963
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,749
This is Officer Bruce Zarrelli.

964
00:40:32,818 --> 00:40:35,519
Yeah. We've met.

965
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:37,454
Officer?

966
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,623
Commissioner Rourke,

967
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:42,159
I overreacted the other night,

968
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:44,227
and I'm sorry.

969
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:46,163
Please accept my apologies.

970
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:49,533
The D.A.'s dropping
the harassment charges.

971
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,301
You can ignore the summons.

972
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,036
You had a hand in that?

973
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:56,173
It was the right call.

974
00:40:56,241 --> 00:41:01,278
I'm sorry you felt disrespected
by my people.

975
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:03,680
(inhales, exhales)

976
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:07,017
(smacks lips)
I should've kept my cool.

977
00:41:09,788 --> 00:41:11,054
Happy birthday.

978
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:15,225
Should I get the Bomb Squad
to open this?

979
00:41:15,294 --> 00:41:17,227
(laughter)

980
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:19,763
Commissioner's courtesy card,
with his cell phone number.

981
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:21,932
If you need him,
give him a call.

982
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Anytime.

983
00:41:26,205 --> 00:41:28,238
Thank you, Frank.

984
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:31,708
You're welcome.

985
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:33,176
Just don't share it

986
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:34,511
with all these guys.

987
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,180
I don't want to get woken up
ten times a night.

988
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:38,849
(laughter)

989
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:49,092
Okay.
