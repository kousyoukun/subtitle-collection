1
00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:02,582
I didn't know that
the bill was past due.

2
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:05,657
Yes, fine, I'll look
into it. Thank you.

3
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:07,492
Hey, here's an extra
bag of socks.

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,294
Dad, why do I need
all of these?

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:12,297
'Cause if you don't want to do
laundry more than once a week,

6
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:13,731
you need extra socks.

7
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:18,072
I also, uh, put
something else in there.

8
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,023
It's college,
you're not a kid anymore,

9
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:21,191
there's gonna be
girls around and...

10
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:23,515
Condoms? Dad, seriously?

11
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:25,150
You don't have to
take it out, okay?

12
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,551
Just put them away.

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,664
For your own protection,
all right?

14
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,821
(phone ringing)

15
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:34,259
Yes, what bill didn't I pay now?

16
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:35,661
Oh, hey, Baez. Yep.

17
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,663
Oh, Sean, catch.

18
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,832
What's this?

19
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:42,200
Your signed Rangers hockey puck.

20
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:43,302
No, this is yours.

21
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,836
Well, every time
I go looking for it,

22
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:47,048
it seems to be in your room,
so I figured, it's all yours.

23
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:47,644
Sweet.

24
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,475
I'm gonna give you
the best gift in the world,

25
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:50,887
and all you're gonna give me
is a "sweet."

26
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:52,022
Just don't expect this back
when you end up

27
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,189
flunking out
and have to come home.

28
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:54,724
I'm not flunking
out of anything.

29
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,949
- Sure.
- Hey, you two knock it off, all right?

30
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:59,318
You, pack up.
You, off to school.

31
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:01,320
Yeah, okay.

32
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:05,223
Come on, Larry. I got to see
my oldest off to college.

33
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:08,460
Just cover me for this game,
would you? Thank you.

34
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:12,331
- Thanks.
- Someone seems frazzled.

35
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:15,667
Says the person not juggling
93 things at the present moment.

36
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,169
Do you want to talk about it?

37
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:19,015
I probably do, but not now.
Let's talk about this.

38
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,138
What do we got?

39
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:22,441
Dr. Max McCandless, age 51.

40
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:24,349
He has a practice upstairs
on the fourth floor.

41
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:26,256
He was coming out of the parking
garage, when out of nowhere,

42
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,982
a guy in a hoodie pumps a dozen
shots through his windshield.

43
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,851
Let me guess, the good doc won't
be healing thyself this time.

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,321
No need, all shots missed except
the one that grazed his wrist.

45
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,393
World's worst shooter?

46
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:44,496
Or the world's luckiest doc.

47
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:50,736
Have you seen Anthony?
He's not in his office.

48
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:52,404
No, you want me to try his cell?

49
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:53,583
No, he's not answering
that, either.

50
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:54,607
Oh, here he comes.

51
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:56,408
Anthony.

52
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:57,609
Sorry I'm late.

53
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:58,678
You okay?

54
00:01:58,746 --> 00:01:59,906
Yeah, my alarm didn't go off,

55
00:01:59,947 --> 00:02:02,414
and then I got stuck
in traffic is all.

56
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:04,349
What's the haps for today?

57
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:05,650
(sighs):
Let's see.

58
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,687
A Flatiron robbery--
that's for you--

59
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,523
prepping victim for trial--
that's for me.

60
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,825
Destruction of Mackenzie
evidence-- that's for you--

61
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,527
and I'm seeing Judge Walsh
at 2:00,

62
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:17,095
so I'm gonna need
that by 1:30.

63
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:20,098
Seriously?
That's barely enough time to...

64
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,100
Where's your watch?
You always wear your watch.

65
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,637
Must've forgot it at home.

66
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:27,939
Is everything okay?

67
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:29,541
Can't a guy have an off morning?

68
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,143
Does it need a big explanation?

69
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,778
All right, fine, fine.

70
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,257
Ms. Reagan, I just got a call
from accounting.

71
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,992
Apparently, there were
charges this morning,

72
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,849
over $8,000

73
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:40,685
on the department card issued
to Detective ABETEMARCO.

74
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:43,789
Okay, we got it, Cameron.
Thanks for your help.

75
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:53,865
I had a date last night.

76
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,600
I met her on Entranced.

77
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,135
Ooh, the hookup app?

78
00:02:57,204 --> 00:03:00,138
That's not what this was.
I mean, we had a great time.

79
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,807
But I woke up this morning,

80
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,444
she was gone,
as was my wallet and my Rolex.

81
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:06,812
You're kidding me.
I called her,

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,214
I texted,
I even went down to the gallery

83
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:11,550
in SoHo she manages,
but they never heard of her.

84
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:14,319
Job was as fake
as her number and her name.

85
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:16,788
- Which was?
- Donna.

86
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:18,134
Let me see
her Entranced profile.

87
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:18,990
Why?

88
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:20,992
Why not?
We got work to do.

89
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:24,596
Anthony, she committed a crime
against you and this office.

90
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,098
Don't you want to find her?

91
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,034
No, I just want to do my job
and you should do yours,

92
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:31,369
and we ain't never
talking about this again.

93
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:32,615
- Listen to me.
- I'll have your answers

94
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,174
on the Mackenzie evidence
by 1:30.

95
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,645
Okay, thank you.
Anyone able to ID the shooter?

96
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:42,647
All were too shook up
to remember anything.

97
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:44,649
Security camera up there
is on the blink.

98
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:47,152
Super said it's been
on backorder for a month.

99
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:48,631
Well, hopefully your partner's
getting something useful

100
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,722
from the victim.

101
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,924
I wish I could be
more helpful, Detective.

102
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,127
I-I just can't think of anyone
I'd consider an enemy.

103
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,207
That's funny, 'cause I could
think of about ten enemies

104
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,763
of mine right off
the top of my head.

105
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:00,499
You're the police.
I'm a fertility doctor.

106
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,667
- Fair enough.
- You're the Baby Magician.

107
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:04,569
I-I've seen you
on the morning talk shows.

108
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:07,405
Yeah, your partner was asking me
about my enemies and, uh,

109
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:09,018
the truth is, couples come to me
desperate to conceive,

110
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,308
I help them.

111
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:13,512
I don't make enemies,
I make dreams come true.

112
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,591
- Ah.
- What about the couples

113
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:15,747
beyond help?

114
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:16,816
They must be devastated

115
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,216
when you have to tell them no.

116
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:20,363
Yeah, thankfully those are
few and far between, and, uh,

117
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:21,987
even they get a referral,

118
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:24,689
and they start wonderful
families via adoption.

119
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,958
How 'bout you, Doc?
You, uh, have a family?

120
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:29,628
Ex-wife and a son.
Uh, Joan and-and Max Jr.

121
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,930
Both of whom
I'm still very close to.

122
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:33,031
Good.

123
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:35,667
Listen...
(stammers)

124
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:36,880
...you know,
if there's nothing else,

125
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:38,336
I'd-I'd really like
to get going.

126
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,505
I was headed to my picnic
when all this began.

127
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:41,773
- <i>Your</i> picnic?
- Yeah.

128
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:43,219
I mean, it's-it's
given by the people

129
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,343
that I help every year
on the High Line.

130
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:48,013
They bring their kids,
we celebrate.

131
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,347
What can I say? I'm blessed.

132
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,515
Well, blessed or not, Doc,

133
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:52,024
somebody's gunning
for you right now.

134
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,230
You sure you don't want to take
a rain check on the picnic?

135
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:56,721
It's already underway and
I-I hate to disappoint people.

136
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,002
All right, tell you what, we'll
make sure you get safe passage.

137
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:02,727
Uh, uh, Cosgrove, can you
give the good doc a lift?

138
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:04,095
I don't know.
Let me ask my boss.

139
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:05,575
Your boss owes me one.
She'll be fine with it.

140
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,999
Trust me. Go ahead. She'll
take care of you. Thank you.

141
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,601
Right this way.

142
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,972
Start with the ex-wife.

143
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,546
(strained grunt)

144
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,548
(exhales)

145
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:30,055
(grunts)

146
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,357
(pants)

147
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,603
THERAPIST:
You're doing just great.

148
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,860
JOHN:
Eh.

149
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:39,197
For a guy who took
two bullets in the spine.

150
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,532
(exhales)

151
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:46,371
My boss is here.

152
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,506
Take five?

153
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:57,716
(grunts)

154
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:02,387
(grunts)

155
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:06,124
Commissioner.

156
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:08,426
What's this, a surprise?

157
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,962
I hate to interrupt.

158
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:12,897
Oh, no worries.

159
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,499
She's a stone sadist.

160
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:16,134
I appreciate the break.

161
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:18,236
Got everything you need?

162
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:21,706
Other than full use
of my legs, I'm all good.

163
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:26,311
Department's gonna take care
of it all.

164
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,312
Medical costs,

165
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,814
transpo, home care.

166
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,049
Till I get back on my feet?

167
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:33,818
Till you tell us
to go the hell away.

168
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:36,821
Just want to get back
on the job.

169
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:42,794
Why are you here, Frank?

170
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:45,230
John, you're not
gonna be cleared

171
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:48,033
to return to active duty.

172
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:52,037
So this is how it works.

173
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:55,640
The department surgeon,
the nature of your injuries,

174
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:59,110
they said no way.

175
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:02,647
You can keep an
administrative post.

176
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:04,649
Or you...

177
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:06,651
can cash out and
collect your pension.

178
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:12,924
That's another shot
in the back is what it is.

179
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:17,462
This one's out
of my hands, John.

180
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,833
I know, Frank.

181
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,272
You said anything I need?

182
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,608
Name it.

183
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:33,945
My son Jay is in the 3-7.

184
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:35,347
Good cop, what I hear.

185
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:38,216
Not surprised, being who.

186
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:42,053
You find the son of a bitch
in the 3-7

187
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:46,725
who refused my boy a post
at the hospital when I was in.

188
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:50,462
What the hell
are you talking about?

189
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,599
You're telling me your son
was refused this post?

190
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,267
You find him, Frank,

191
00:07:56,336 --> 00:08:00,105
and fire his ass.

192
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,908
(sighs)

- Janko.
- Officer Janko,

198
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:36,496
this is Officer Irving,
3rd Precinct.

199
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:38,498
- Yeah?
- Ten minutes ago, I detained

200
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:40,166
several juveniles at Adams Park.

201
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:43,102
One of 'em said
his name is Sean.

202
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:45,238
Handed me a courtesy card
claiming you're family.

203
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,673
- Is he okay?
- Other than getting popped

204
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:49,675
for cutting class
and underage drinking.

205
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:51,410
You want to come talk about it?

206
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,246
Just you, not Uncle Jamie!

207
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,281
I'm on my way.

208
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:00,987
You can say no again,

209
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:02,555
but they're not gonna take no.

210
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,657
There's a lot of baseball
left in this season,

211
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:06,826
and they'll just come back
with another game

212
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,361
for you to throw out
the first pitch.

213
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:12,164
Offer them an at bat.

214
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:16,102
The offer and the
tradition is first pitch.

215
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,704
I know that,
but with my unique skill set,

216
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,873
I might get lucky
and slap a single.

217
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:23,009
No one's ever done that.

218
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:25,111
You're serious.

219
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:26,445
First at bat I would do.

220
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,180
Otherwise, no. Next.

221
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,550
Regarding Detective
Marino and his son Jay.

222
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:34,153
CO at 3-7 says
you got it exactly backward.

223
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:36,289
I do?

224
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,823
I mean, Detective Marino did.

225
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:40,092
CO says the moment
he heard Jay's old man

226
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:42,194
was shot,
he went to the kid

227
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:43,896
and offered to contact
Employee Relations

228
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,698
and have him assigned
to the hospital.

229
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,200
But Jay declined the offer.

230
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,738
Because?

231
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:53,873
CO didn't know.

232
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:56,175
But he said Jay not only refused
the assignment,

233
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,010
he's been looking to work
any overtime

234
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:59,011
that comes by.

235
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,646
Yeah, doesn't make sense.

236
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,214
So it's a he said-he said.

237
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:04,250
Look, there's
a whole family history

238
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:07,219
with the NYPD
beyond father and son.

239
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,154
The father's father.

240
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:09,233
- Yeah.
- And both his brothers

241
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:11,190
and a couple of cousins.

242
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,759
And the late wife was an
EMT in Westchester County.

243
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:16,696
And to refuse that duty
at the hospital,

244
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:18,364
that would be pretty
unprecedented

245
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,132
for a family like that.

246
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:24,370
Yeah, kind of like
if a Reagan did it.

247
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:42,154
JANKO:
Skipping school,

248
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:45,291
getting boozed up... really?

249
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
It was just one beer.

250
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:47,693
Ah, Officer Irving said it was

251
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:50,296
a 12-pack among four kids.

252
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:52,164
So what, you never drank
when you were 16?

253
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,944
Sean, this isn't about me,
this is about you.

254
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:57,603
Being a Reagan means holding
yourself to a higher standard.

255
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,538
And not just because
screwups embarrass

256
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:00,840
the rest of the family,

257
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:02,508
but because it is
the right thing to do.

258
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,276
I'm not even a Reagan yet
and I know that.

259
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:05,678
So you're gonna tell him?

260
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,547
No, I'm not gonna tell him.

261
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:11,017
But, hey, this card?

262
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:13,119
This is a one-time deal.

263
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:14,620
And you just used yours.

264
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:15,955
Okay, you understand?

265
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:18,057
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Guess so or you know so?

266
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:19,659
- I know so.
- Okay.

267
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:22,928
Good. Because I'm starting to
sound like your Uncle Jamie

268
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,264
and it is scaring
the hell out of me.

269
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,799
Let's go.

270
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:31,637
Max was shot?

271
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:32,738
Shot at.

272
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,573
He got little more
than a scratch.

273
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,575
But we still haven't found
the shooter.

274
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:39,712
Well, it wasn't me, if that's
what you're insinuating.

275
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:42,848
What would make you think
we're insinuating it was you?

276
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,228
Well, it's no secret
my ex-husband

277
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:45,484
and I don't get along.

278
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,253
Well, it's a secret to him.

279
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:48,821
Max is all about his image.

280
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,856
Bright and cheery,
beloved by everyone.

281
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,491
But the reality's different.

282
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
(sighs) The more his career
heated up,

283
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,363
the more our marriage
froze over.

284
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,265
Pretty soon there was
only enough room

285
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,500
for his patients and his ego.

286
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,436
not his actual wife and son.

287
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:05,037
Your son, is
that who happens

288
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:06,539
to be eavesdropping
on us right now?

289
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,774
(floorboard creaks)

290
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,543
When you find whoever
shot at my dad,

291
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:11,811
I'll hire him a lawyer.

292
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,245
Honey, don't say that.

293
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:14,591
No, please continue.
As a matter of fact,

294
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:16,882
where were you at 8:05 this morning?
- NYU.

295
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,684
Little vague.
Could you be more specific?

296
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:22,188
In Bobst Library at NYU,
studying.

297
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,723
And you, Ms. McCandless?

298
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,792
I was at Morningstar Pilates,
three blocks from here.

299
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,195
Which means neither of us
had anything to do

300
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:31,897
with whatever this is.

301
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,468
So it's time for you to leave.

302
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:41,207
Okay.

303
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,283
(sighs)

304
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:56,856
Anthony.

305
00:12:56,924 --> 00:13:01,193
Uh, Judge Walsh grant
the adjournment?

306
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:02,795
All 'cause of your stellar work.

307
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,130
It's what I do.

308
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:06,332
I did some work on my own today.

309
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,803
I disputed the bank charges.

310
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:11,937
You won't take a hit.

311
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,405
Oh, that's great news.

312
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:16,108
I also dug around a little
on our Donna woman.

313
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,777
Didn't I say to drop it?

314
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,945
Yeah, that's the beauty
of being the boss.

315
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:21,347
I get to call the shots.

316
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:25,751
So I ran her description against
some other complaints,

317
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,165
and I'm pretty sure she's been
making a business out of this.

318
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:30,589
At least ten other guys gave
similar descriptions.

319
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:34,026
So I'm just one more schmuck.
Great.

320
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,428
You're not a schmuck.

321
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:37,863
Now let me see her profile.

322
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:46,405
Wow. She is a hottie.

323
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:47,840
What does that mean?

324
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,642
That I'm too much of a schlub
to get her?

325
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,010
That's not what I mean.

326
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:52,711
Uh, look, right there.

327
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,414
She said she prefers men
with meat on their bones.

328
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:58,317
She even puts a little emoji
face with the hearts for eyes.

329
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:01,320
Well, I can see why she swiped
right on you.

330
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,556
Okay, now that you've seen her,
are we done?

331
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:04,990
Not till she's in jail.

332
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,926
You want her arrested?

333
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:09,562
Anthony, she's setting up dates
to steal from people.

334
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,964
Your watch alone
is grand larceny.

335
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,766
But if we grab her,
I'll get outed.

336
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,301
As what?

337
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,803
As the idiot who got suckered on
a dating app.

338
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:20,039
No one is looking at you
as an idiot.

339
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:22,308
Not yet. Please, Erin.

340
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:26,412
Uh, my job says that I can see
things coming a mile off.

341
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,315
If people find out, they'll
laugh me out of the building.

342
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:33,686
Anthony, you are a victim
of a crime.

343
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,155
Now, what do we tell victims
in this building?

344
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:37,957
There's no reason to feel shame

345
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,345
because you've done
nothing wrong.

346
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:40,559
That's right.

347
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:41,727
Now, do you believe that?

348
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,095
Of course I do.

349
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:44,630
Then act like it.

350
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:49,068
Fine.

351
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,871
(sighs) Entranced has
an office in Midtown,

352
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:53,939
I'm gonna go down there

353
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:55,986
and see if I can get them
to cough up her real name.

354
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,911
You're not gonna get past the
receptionist without a subpoena.

355
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,046
So how am I supposed to ID her?

356
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:12,022
ABETEMARCO:
Come on, just one fingerprint

357
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,539
or some hair to pull
this Donna's DNA off.

358
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,540
- Wow.
- What, you found something?

359
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,442
No, I'm--

360
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,910
I can't get over this place.

361
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,712
It's so nice and neat.

362
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:24,881
- Why, is that weird?
- No, it's just...

363
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:27,150
your office always looks like
a bomb blew up.

364
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,286
Oh, so I'm a fatso,
a schmuck and a slob.

365
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:31,954
That's not what I mean.

366
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:33,356
I mean that any date

367
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:37,693
would be thrilled to meet
a guy with such great taste.

368
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,039
Yeah, well,
you got to make an effort.

369
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:43,065
Not all of us have the luxury
of booty calls with the ex.

370
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:46,035
(scoffs) I do not have
booty calls with Jack.

371
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:48,304
Believe it or not, I'm serious
about finding someone.

372
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,807
It's lonely being single
in this city,

373
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,709
and hooking up ain't half as fun
as an actual relationship.

374
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:57,013
Not that I could suss out the
real thing anymore, apparently.

375
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,749
Sounds like
you really did like Donna.

376
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:02,018
What can I say?

377
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,921
She was a looker,
we made each other laugh.

378
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:06,489
Halfway through dinner,

379
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:08,491
she leaned over
and kissed me.

380
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,160
Even though it was all an act,
it was nice.

381
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:12,595
It felt right.

382
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:16,199
Well, maybe that's why I
sometimes fall back with Jack.

383
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,268
But still, there's more to love
than just feeling right.

384
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,670
Why are you settling?

385
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:22,205
Good question.

386
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,073
Look, I'm not finding
anything here.

387
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,242
We did what we could.

388
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,644
- Let's go.
- Think you're holding back on something.

389
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:39,956
Obviously, uh, CSU will find

390
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,124
my prints on these, but...

391
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:44,126
they might find her
prints on 'em, too.

392
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:46,896
You know the expression TMI?

393
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

394
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,601
This goes way beyond that.

395
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,139
Eddie, it's no big deal.

396
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,008
It is. I told Sean
I wouldn't say anything

397
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,360
and I blabbed
after five seconds.

398
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:02,927
Just to me,
that doesn't count.

399
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:06,497
In your family, are there, like,
rules about who knows what?

400
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:07,832
What do you mean?

401
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,533
Is it like all for one
and one for all

402
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:11,001
or are there secrets?

403
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,070
No secrets, really.

404
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:13,515
Certain things are
on a need-to-know basis.

405
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,540
Like you giving the boys
courtesy cards, for example.

406
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,576
(sighs) Okay.

407
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,711
It's good what you did, okay?

408
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,100
Any of us would
tell you the same.

409
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:27,618
Oh, look who it is.

410
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:30,187
Danny, come to see the new digs?

411
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,723
Nah, actually, I was on
my way back to the squad. - Mm.

412
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,925
After being called in
to Sean's school today.

413
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:37,128
- What's the problem?
- Oh.

414
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:38,529
Well, what isn't the problem?

415
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:40,075
I mean, he picked a fight
with some kid,

416
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,377
he hasn't been doing
his homework

417
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,533
and his grades are slipping.

418
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,502
- That's rough.
- No.

419
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,670
Rough is me getting
the whole truth out of him.

420
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:48,350
Including the part about you
getting him off the hook

421
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:49,540
for underage drinking.

422
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,776
Danny, I was only
trying to help.

423
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:54,345
Trying to help? By not
telling his own father?

424
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:56,614
And what about you? You
couldn't tell me either?

425
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:59,650
Danny, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

426
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,763
Look, you two want
to raise kids,

427
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:01,919
feel free to have your own.

428
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:04,321
But leave raising Sean
and Jack to me, okay?

429
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:11,729
(indistinct chatter nearby)

430
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,533
Fingerprint gave us her
real name: Maude Weaver.

431
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,535
Maude? No wonder
she picked Donna.

432
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:18,769
She got a record?

433
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:19,870
Long as her legs.

434
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:21,038
You get an address?

435
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,239
Multiple.

436
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:24,809
Various landlords said
she liked to live large,

437
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:26,277
and when she
runs out of money,

438
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:29,413
she offers to trade sex for
rent or skips out altogether.

439
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,781
Current place?

440
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,316
I couldn't find it.

441
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:33,818
So no way to track her down?

442
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,753
Could go back on the app.

443
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,688
Matched with her once,
might happen again.

444
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:39,156
But she'd know it was you.

445
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:43,194
She ain't the only one
that can make a fake profile.

446
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:48,532
So we decided to watch security
footage from nearby buildings.

447
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,434
Every single minute of it.

448
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:51,880
Did you, uh,
see the man who shot at me?

449
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:54,305
Unfortunately, no, but we
did find someone else

450
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,973
who was very
interesting, a woman,

451
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,476
standing outside at various
times of various days,

452
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:00,478
but always looking up
at this building

453
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:01,879
and in particular,
at this office.

454
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:03,692
We think she might be an
accomplice to the shooter.

455
00:19:03,716 --> 00:19:04,716
You recognize her?

456
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,585
You're kidding me.

457
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:08,786
So you do recognize her.

458
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:13,390
Yeah, her-her name is, um,
Noelle King.

459
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,471
She was hired as our
receptionist a couple weeks ago.

460
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:18,262
Well, is she working today?
I don't see her anywhere.

461
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,964
That's 'cause she quit
after one shift.

462
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,565
I guess it's a thing
these days.

463
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:24,368
Kids ghost on their dates and
now they ghost on their jobs.

464
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:25,323
Why would she?

465
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:26,905
That's what doesn't
make any sense.

466
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:29,473
I pay very well,
she was great at the job,

467
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,509
but when she didn't come back,
we checked to see

468
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,310
if she stole anything,
but she didn't.

469
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,912
You have an address
or a phone number?

470
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:37,147
Yeah. Yeah,
I even have, uh, her paycheck

471
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:38,549
for the one day she worked.

472
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,138
If you find her
you can give it to her.

473
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:52,162
No formalities today, Officer.

474
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:12,016
Sit down.

475
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:26,230
Cop comes to One PP,
headed for the 14th floor.

476
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,234
Seems like everybody in the
building knows it, clocks it.

477
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:31,669
Thought this would be simpler.

478
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,007
I'm suddenly trying to remember
every screwup I've made lately

479
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,375
and I'm-I'm not coming up...

480
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:40,210
That's not why you're here.

481
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,180
Well, that's good to know, sir.

482
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:44,882
Actually, from what I read,

483
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,851
you have excellent
evaluations from your COs

484
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,954
and a good number of
"attaboys" from the public.

485
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:51,722
Just doing my job, sir.

486
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,325
I do have a question for you.

487
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:57,461
You don't have to answer it.

488
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,097
I'm not sure what
that means, Commissioner.

489
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,734
It means it's police business,
but not official.

490
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:06,670
Okay.

491
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,573
Did you turn down a posting

492
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:11,976
to the hospital
after your dad was shot,

493
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:15,412
or did somebody drop the ball?

494
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:22,119
No one dropped the ball, sir.

495
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:23,420
(sighs)

496
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:25,856
You're a beat cop
with a master's degree

497
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,758
in urban planning.

498
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:29,760
Yes.

499
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,763
You had a question for me, sir?

500
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,666
I just asked it.

501
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:39,470
Look, Jay,

502
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,006
I've heard just about
every story there is,

503
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:46,176
a whole lot of 'em around
my own dining room table,

504
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:47,845
so...

505
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:52,616
I never wanted to be a cop.

506
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,522
But it's all
my dad ever wanted.

507
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,457
Granddad and uncles, too.

508
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:03,227
It's all anyone could ever talk
about at family get-togethers

509
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,229
and summers up at Pottsgrove.

510
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,631
I know that drill.

511
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,800
Policing's in my genes.

512
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,703
But not in your gut.

513
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:16,173
But it's too late now.

514
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:19,510
My dad's bounced from active
duty 'cause of the injury.

515
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:22,379
If there was a time for me
to go, it's already passed.

516
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:24,615
And I love my dad.

517
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:32,956
I didn't take the post
because...

518
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:37,494
I-I just couldn't take
all that brothers-in-blue stuff.

519
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:39,596
It was bound
to be the whole climate.

520
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:45,436
If there's nothing else, sir...

521
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,938
No, there's nothing else.

522
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:52,509
Look, Jay...

523
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:55,946
I promise you this will stay
between you and me.

524
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,462
GORMLEY:
Boss, maybe he just

525
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:17,863
hasn't had his
defining moment yet.

526
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,698
- Defining moment?
- As a cop.

527
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,668
We all got that one time,
that one action--

528
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:26,672
the nickel drops, we all go,
"I love this job."

529
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,374
BAKER:
How long has he been

530
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:29,842
<i>on</i> the job?
A little over

531
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,911
four and a half years,
which brings his family's total

532
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,180
to somewhere around
a century of service.

533
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,615
Well, that's
quite a legacy.

534
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:38,517
Yeah, he should be proud,
not whiny.

535
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:41,320
He wasn't whiny, Sid.

536
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:44,223
Is this a first--
you with no opinion?

537
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,792
As is often pointed out,
I'm not a cop.

538
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:48,394
I'm well aware.

539
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,829
So I have what is certain to be

540
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:55,734
a distinctly and likely
unwelcome minority opinion.

541
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:57,770
That you're keeping to yourself?
I like that.

542
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,139
Please share.

543
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:01,874
As a non-cop,

544
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,909
I don't go all butterscotch
and marshmallows

545
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:06,311
talking about a
big cop family.

546
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,746
And therefore?

547
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,615
What if we were talking
about a surgeon

548
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:11,016
from a long line of surgeons?

549
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,052
Only this surgeon's
only a surgeon

550
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,353
because he felt pressured

551
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,754
to be one. He hates it.

552
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,623
But he didn't want
to disappoint his family.

553
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,861
You want him operating on you?

554
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:31,136
Garrett, that's not
the same thing.

555
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,939
GARRETT: No? What if he's covering you
in a police action,

556
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:36,008
and the guns come out?
Has he ever

557
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:37,609
fired his weapon in
the line of duty?

558
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:40,512
I didn't go through
every page in his file.

559
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:44,516
Let's assume he's one of the 99%
in the department who hasn't.

560
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:47,319
What if his partner's
life's at stake?

561
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,421
Remember, his
heart's not in it.

562
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,090
Never was.

563
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,958
(sighs)

564
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,960
If he freezes up,

565
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,262
that's <i>his</i> defining moment.

566
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,769
(indistinct chatter)

567
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,415
Oh, excuse me. That's taken.

568
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:18,250
(clears throat)
You mean for Ryan?

569
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,285
The man you were matched with?

570
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,154
He's not coming.

571
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,555
What?

572
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:25,557
You're the sucker
this time, Maude.

573
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,593
Who are you?

574
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,596
Long version--
I'm the person that discovered

575
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:32,965
you have a history
of arrests up and down

576
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,033
the Eastern seaboard,

577
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,769
along with some outstanding
warrants for theft, fraud

578
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:39,838
and conspiracy. Short version
is-- I'm the person

579
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,607
who's putting you in jail.

580
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,743
(laughs)

581
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:47,212
I am so sorry,
but you have the wrong person.

582
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:51,083
My name isn't... "Maude,"
and I didn't do any of that.

583
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,252
Yes, it is, and yes, you did.

584
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,954
And you did worse.
You preyed on

585
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,868
men's insecurities
to get them to drop their guard,

586
00:25:57,892 --> 00:26:00,626
as well as their pants,
but this time, you screwed up

587
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:01,994
'cause you did it to a friend.

588
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,629
ABETEMARCO:
That would be me,

589
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:06,632
and you would
be under arrest.

590
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
Remember these, Maude?

591
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:13,705
Come on. Get up.

592
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:15,741
Come on.

593
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,982
So, Jack, have you signed
up for your classes?

594
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,491
Not yet.
When I get done on Thursday.

595
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,997
Most of them will
already be filled up.

596
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,760
- Seriously? Why?
- Nobody knows.

597
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:29,961
Just the way it
works for freshmen.

598
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,300
Not the classes
that he's gonna take.

599
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,175
How do you know?

600
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,452
Well, he wants to take
all the hardest classes

601
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:34,575
to show what
a grind he is.

602
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:36,477
- Shut up.
DANNY: All right, enough.

603
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:38,145
You figure out
your major yet, bud?

604
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:39,847
- Yeah, major loser.
- Hey, zip it.

605
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,983
Not sure yet.

606
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,785
HENRY: Just make sure
that it's something

607
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,487
that leads to a real job.

608
00:26:46,556 --> 00:26:48,122
- What are you talking about?
- Well,

609
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,991
philosophy and creative writing
and such are great

610
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,961
if you're looking for a job
in 18th-century Florence.

611
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,962
Come on, Pop.

612
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,430
I majored in art history.

613
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,698
I have a job,

614
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,867
one I love, a good one.
DANNY: One which

615
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:02,203
also has nothing to
do with your major.

616
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:03,604
- Hence his point.
NICKY: Yeah.

617
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:06,006
Well, it made me look
at the world in a different way.

618
00:27:06,075 --> 00:27:07,319
JAMIE: Um, I'm with
Eddie. I think

619
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:10,444
that studying law gave me
a whole new perspective.

620
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:12,546
I majored in botany
until I didn't.

621
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:14,026
And I turned out just fine.
DANNY: Not for nothing,

622
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,383
but that's usually you let
someone else say about you.

623
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:17,718
It's just a fact, Danny.

624
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:19,331
They'll probably get
good jobs right away,

625
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:20,955
but the least happy
people at my school

626
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:22,323
are the ones
majoring in business

627
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,858
and economics.

628
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:26,760
I'm gonna say something
I very rarely say.

629
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:28,863
Don't listen to Pop on this one.

630
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:30,197
Really?

631
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:33,467
In a few days, you're gonna
be gone from this place,

632
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:36,470
starting out in the
world on your own.

633
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,440
Make the world your own.

634
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:42,243
Take what is useful
from your time with us,

635
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:45,980
your years around this table,

636
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,216
but don't think you
have to become us.

637
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:52,386
But if you do...

638
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,088
You do.

639
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:55,856
If you don't,

640
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,858
you don't.

641
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:02,529
It's your life, not ours.

642
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,231
(sighs)

643
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,468
And I like to think
that your dad

644
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:11,778
and your aunt and your uncle
do what they do

645
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:14,647
because they were drawn to it,

646
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:18,050
not because they were pushed.

647
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:25,424
I like to think.

648
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:28,661
I hope, anyway.

649
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,468
Anyway...

650
00:28:35,536 --> 00:28:37,803
to Jack.

651
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,409
Happy trails.

652
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:46,178
Good luck.

653
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:50,088
Godspeed.

654
00:28:57,765 --> 00:28:59,456
This is the
last of them.

655
00:28:59,457 --> 00:29:00,109
Thanks.

656
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,675
You're welcome.

657
00:29:01,744 --> 00:29:03,877
- Hey, Danny?
- Yeah.

658
00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:06,980
Look... I don't want to keep
butting in your business.

659
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,516
Right, 'cause that's
Eddie's job now.

660
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:13,887
I think I know why
Sean's been acting out lately.

661
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:15,756
He doesn't want Jack
to leave.

662
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:18,258
Funny way to show it by
ragging on him all the time.

663
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:19,827
He's been showing it
the whole time--

664
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:21,473
by getting busted,
the trouble at school.

665
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:23,097
Sean's trying

666
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:25,299
to be a problem
so that Jack'll decide

667
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:28,235
to stick around and keep
his kid brother in line.

668
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,604
And you know this how,
Mr. Freud?

669
00:29:30,673 --> 00:29:33,107
'Cause I did the same thing
when you left for the Marines.

670
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:35,020
Oh, what happened? Did you get
a B-minus on your test?

671
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:36,610
A-minus. It was a dark time.

672
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:39,546
Uh-huh. Do me a favor--
leave the parenting to me.

673
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:40,895
I was just trying
to help, Danny.

674
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,216
You want to help, help Eddie.

675
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:43,450
Help Eddie what?

676
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,219
(laughing):
Oh, look, I love her,

677
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:48,722
and she's great, sincerely,
and you guys are great together,

678
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:51,058
but the two of you need
to mind your business.

679
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:52,604
We already apologized
for that, Danny.

680
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:54,495
You got a problem
with that, go to hell.

681
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:55,963
(dish clinks loudly)

682
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:57,965
(sighs)

683
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:06,940
She's all yours.

684
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,653
Sure you don't want this collar,
ABETEMARCO?

685
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:11,612
Nah, me and Maude have spent
enough time together.

686
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,480
Besides, I'm gonna
take the stand against her.

687
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,516
Like, in public?

688
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,916
Whatever it takes.

689
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,684
Drop by later to get your cuffs.

690
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:20,687
Mm, might want
to wash those first.

691
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:22,156
Could you not?

692
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:24,024
What?

693
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:25,459
I'm proud of you.

694
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:27,661
It takes a lot
to stand up and be counted.

695
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,430
I got work to do.

696
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:34,101
Dinner later? I've got a friend
from the Brooklyn DA's office.

697
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,005
I think I'm done dating
for a while, but thanks.

698
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:50,317
Am I being arrested?

699
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:52,230
That depends on why you've
been hanging around down

700
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:53,987
at the medical tower
on Chambers Street.

701
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:56,156
What? I Ne...
I never go down there.

702
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:58,158
♪ Ta-da! ♪

703
00:30:58,227 --> 00:30:59,960
- It's like magic.
DANNY: Yeah.

704
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,995
Almost like she's a magician.

705
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:04,231
Now answer the question.

706
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,200
Right, um,

707
00:31:06,268 --> 00:31:08,402
no, I-I worked in that building
for a couple weeks.

708
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,471
You mean a couple hours.
Eight hours, in fact.

709
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:12,739
Then you left,

710
00:31:12,808 --> 00:31:14,741
then you came back
and cased the joint

711
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,643
for a week for some guy.
Who's the guy?

712
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:18,645
- A guy?
- The guy!

713
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:20,581
Playing dumb doesn't look good
on you, Noelle.

714
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,282
I don't know any guy.

715
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:24,218
The same guy who you helped
then turned around

716
00:31:24,286 --> 00:31:25,786
and tried to kill
Dr. McCandless.

717
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:28,589
Why would I want Dr. McCandless
dead? He's my father.

718
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:30,558
Come again?

719
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,398
All my life, this man,
Roy King, has been my dad...

720
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,300
until I did one of those tests,

721
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:43,203
those genealogy things
where you send in your DNA,

722
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:46,473
and it told me
that this man is not my dad.

723
00:31:48,177 --> 00:31:50,110
I asked my mom

724
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:53,547
if I was adopted,
and she said no.

725
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:56,750
In fact, they had gone
to this amazing doctor

726
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:59,319
for IVF to get pregnant.

727
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:00,821
The Baby Magician.

728
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:04,391
I found a video
of Dr. McCandless online.

729
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,592
I just...

730
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:07,961
I just saw myself in him.

731
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,431
So you got a job at his clinic
to get his DNA?

732
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,800
Yeah, from his coffee cup.
And it proved it.

733
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,335
That your mother had an affair?

734
00:32:15,404 --> 00:32:17,070
No. (chuckles softly)

735
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,973
Never in a million years.

736
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:22,042
So, then, how did you...?

737
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:26,613
Wait a minute.

738
00:32:26,682 --> 00:32:30,117
Dr. McCandless used
his own sperm in the IVF?

739
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:34,354
(sighs)

740
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:37,958
Who else knows about this?

741
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:41,061
There's a Web forum
of other kids

742
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,230
who were born
because of Dr. McCandless.

743
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,699
There are more kids? How many?

744
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:48,535
I-I don't know, I just...

745
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:51,538
I went online and asked around
if anyone else had ever felt

746
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:53,640
like their dads
weren't their dads.

747
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,044
Could be one of them's
our shooter.

748
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:59,079
We're gonna need
all their names.

749
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:01,092
I-I don't have them.
I mean, people use screen names.

750
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:04,318
I-I swear, I did not mean
to make anyone want to kill him.

751
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,957
Unbelievable.

752
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:13,860
McCandless is playing God
when really he's a monster.

753
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:16,697
He better hope the shooter
finds him before we do.

754
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:18,365
Sit tight.

755
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:28,327
Thank you so much,
Dr. McCandless.

756
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:29,961
We thought
we'd never see this day.

757
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,963
Or have such a beautiful baby.
(laughs)

758
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:33,943
Take care. I'll see
all three of you in a month. - Yeah.

759
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:35,333
McCANDLESS: Huh?
- There he is.

760
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:37,035
BAEZ:
Secure all computers,

761
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:38,736
data, medical samples.

762
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:39,989
What is this?

763
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:41,307
You're getting knocked
off your pedestal

764
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:42,411
like you deserve.
Step back, please.

765
00:33:42,435 --> 00:33:43,375
I-I didn't do anything.

766
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:45,577
DANNY: Give me your hands.
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.

767
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:46,756
Take it easy there.
I'm the victim.

768
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,179
Somebody tried to kill me.

769
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:50,782
Because you've been knocking up
your own patients for years.

770
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:52,884
What I did was help people.

771
00:33:52,953 --> 00:33:54,185
Folks, this is-this is all

772
00:33:54,254 --> 00:33:55,720
a misunderstanding.

773
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:57,333
How many families' lives
are gonna be ripped apart

774
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:58,423
because of what you did?

775
00:33:58,492 --> 00:34:00,525
How many more kids
like Noelle King?

776
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:03,394
Noelle was one?

777
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:05,408
What's the matter, you don't
recognize your own daughter?

778
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:06,742
That must be tough.
There's got to be quite a few.

779
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:08,678
What do you got, hundreds,
maybe thousands out there?

780
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:10,568
Exactly, exactly,
what I did was give people

781
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:11,848
the children
that they begged for.

782
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:13,238
Why am I the bad guy?

783
00:34:13,306 --> 00:34:14,205
- Move it.
- Maybe some of your kids

784
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,373
will visit you in prison.

785
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:17,442
They can explain it to you.
(phone rings)

786
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:18,776
Reagan.

787
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:20,612
Noelle?

788
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Noelle? No, slow down.
What are you talking about?

789
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:26,885
We're on our way.

790
00:34:26,953 --> 00:34:28,052
What's going on?

791
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:30,388
I think we found our shooter.

792
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:55,380
Gonna need you

793
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:57,549
to put that gun down
facing the water.

794
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,817
Right on the bench, Roy.

795
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:01,653
- How did you...?
- Your daughter

796
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:03,922
Noelle fessed up it was you
who went after McCandless--

797
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,991
after she lied
and blamed somebody else.

798
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:10,828
She covered for me?

799
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:12,096
Yeah.

800
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:13,331
That is, until you went

801
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,733
and said good-bye
about an hour ago.

802
00:35:15,802 --> 00:35:17,602
She told me
I could find you here.

803
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:20,939
This is where we
always would come.

804
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:24,742
Not anymore.

805
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:27,579
Hey. Take your finger

806
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,247
off the trigger
there, Roy, okay?

807
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:31,583
You do not want
to hurt yourself.

808
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:34,152
Just like you didn't want
to kill Dr. McCandless.

809
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,286
Like hell I didn't.

810
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:36,955
You missed a dozen shots
at close range.

811
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:38,656
No one's that bad of a shot,
okay?

812
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:42,293
Why did he do what he did?

813
00:35:42,362 --> 00:35:44,028
Why did he hurt those people?

814
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:45,563
I'm not the person to ask.

815
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:47,365
When Noelle told
me, I just...

816
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:50,668
I lost my mind. I...

817
00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:54,505
And you'll go before a judge
and tell him the story.

818
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:56,808
And nobody's gonna blame you.

819
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,810
But don't do
something stupid now

820
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:01,412
and make it even worse, okay?

821
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:02,914
Just put the gun down.

822
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:05,917
Come on.

823
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,793
I don't care what happens.

824
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:18,796
It's not like I have
a family anymore.

825
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:22,600
I think there's somebody
who would disagree

826
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:25,103
with that assessment.
Turn around.

827
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:30,008
Dad.

828
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:32,910
You lied to protect me?

829
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:35,179
I would do anything for my dad.
(handcuffs clicking)

830
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:38,216
'Cause that's who you are
and who you always will be.

831
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:46,157
Dad, Mom needs us. Both of us.

832
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:58,169
We'll make a detour on the way
back to the squad, okay?

833
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:05,376
Only a couple more, which
is a relief for my back.

834
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:07,512
Lightweight.

835
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,181
Very funny. Go help your uncle.

836
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,717
So, why is Danny
having us see him off?

837
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:14,852
Oh, maybe to show us
how good a dad he is.

838
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:17,088
Rub it in our faces a bit.

839
00:37:17,157 --> 00:37:20,425
Let me grab that.
Yo.

840
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:21,893
Thank you.

841
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:24,762
I'm gonna miss you guys.

842
00:37:24,831 --> 00:37:26,297
(laughs)

843
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:27,732
- Have fun, man.
- I will.

844
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,534
Hey, we're only
a phone call away.

845
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:30,768
I know, I know.
Here.

846
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:32,081
That's a little mad money
for you.

847
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,105
Put that in your pocket,
all right?

848
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:36,040
Sean, come on, man.

849
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:38,676
Come say good-bye
to your brother.

850
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:41,579
All right. I guess
I'll, uh, see you around.

851
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:43,347
Actually, you're coming with us.

852
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,750
- I am?
- Yeah, it was Dad's idea.

853
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:47,785
Figured you'll help me
get settled in,

854
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:49,320
then we'll cruise
around campus.

855
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,399
This way you know what's what

856
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:51,434
for when you visit
on the weekends.

857
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,790
Okay, cool.
How does that sound?

858
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,336
- Good? - Awesome, yeah.
Come on, let's go.

859
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,694
I'll be right there.

860
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:59,931
Hey, I just, uh, want
to say sorry to you guys.

861
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:01,399
Especially you, Eddie.

862
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:02,667
No, I screwed up, Danny.

863
00:38:02,736 --> 00:38:03,746
No, I screwed up, as usual,

864
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,069
running around with my hair

865
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:07,149
on fire, and you were just
trying to help and look out,

866
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:09,307
so... sorry.
I hope you forgive me.

867
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,877
- Hey. Yeah.
- Yeah.

868
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:15,346
Thanks. I don't want to hug you.

869
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,115
(playful growling)
I don't want to hug you.

870
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:19,183
I could use some of
that mad money, though.

871
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:20,585
It's expensive
raising these two.

872
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:21,897
I got a little circus
of my own coming up.

873
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:22,954
It's called a wedding.

874
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:26,424
Right. Well, you chose well.

875
00:38:26,493 --> 00:38:27,992
- Let's not go overboard.
- Hey.

876
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:29,627
What?

877
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:35,500
Did he say what this is about?

878
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:37,635
He did not, Officer.

879
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:41,305
Welcome.

880
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:43,274
Thanks for the invite.

881
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:47,645
Please.

882
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:49,614
Thank you.

883
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:52,650
FRANK:
Thank you, Baker.

884
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:56,154
My son Jay.

885
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,024
Nice to meet you, Jay.

886
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:03,194
You, too, sir.

887
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:05,630
You find that idiot refused
Jay's duty at the hospital?

888
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:08,533
I did, John.
Heads rolled. All I can say.

889
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:09,667
Thank you, Frank.

890
00:39:09,736 --> 00:39:11,636
And while I was sorting
the mess out,

891
00:39:11,704 --> 00:39:14,272
I got a look
at your son's service record.

892
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,240
He's got a very valuable degree.

893
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:17,642
Very proud of him.

894
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,578
Well, you should be.
And I don't need to tell you,

895
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,914
John, about the problems
policing the projects.

896
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:24,115
You certainly don't.

897
00:39:24,184 --> 00:39:26,617
So I started thinking,
I've always fought

898
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:30,087
the Housing Development Board
to bring in a cop.

899
00:39:30,156 --> 00:39:32,890
I mean, the projects
should be planned with a nod

900
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,026
towards policing them,
don't you think?

901
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:37,528
So, it seems to me

902
00:39:37,597 --> 00:39:40,298
someone with Jay's résumé

903
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:43,201
would be a valuable asset
over there and would be

904
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:44,836
long after you and
I have gone fishing.

905
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:49,540
But there's a problem.

906
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:55,446
They still will not allow a cop
on the board.

907
00:39:57,517 --> 00:40:01,719
And the only solution
would be for him to resign.

908
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:05,823
And I would never ask Jay
to do that.

909
00:40:08,094 --> 00:40:10,094
Jay...

910
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:13,464
our police commissioner's
asking us for a favor.

911
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,766
It's up to you, Dad.

912
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,340
Yes, sir.

913
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:27,211
Good. Good.

914
00:40:29,515 --> 00:40:31,649
You sure about this?

915
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:35,253
Thank you, sir.

916
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,258
Thank you, Jay.

917
