1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,478
Job came in about
an hour ago from sanitation.

2
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,413
There was nothing else?
Just the head?

3
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:12,084
So far. M.E.'s office
is on the way.

4
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,585
Pretty decomposed.

5
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:16,388
Why don't you go on up there
and have a closer look?

6
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:18,590
He just said M.E.'s on the way.

7
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:21,126
I'll look out
for them. Go on.

8
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,133
When you were
taking the test,

9
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:30,282
you ever think you'd be
climbing up a pile of garbage

10
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:31,970
to get to a severed head?

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,206
No. Thought I'd be more like

12
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:37,776
Paul Newman
in <i>Fort Apache, The Bronx.</i>

13
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,644
It was <i>Cagney & Lacey</i> for me.

14
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:41,513
You know we could just retire,

15
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,116
and go to a tropical island
and solve crimes there.

16
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:45,383
We could,
but you would

17
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:47,119
never survive outside
the five boroughs.

18
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:48,620
That's true.

19
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,257
Yeah, it's Mano Sangriento.

20
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:53,592
Black hand?

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,795
No, just the fingers.
But it was a hand.

22
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:58,196
That's the calling card.

23
00:00:58,265 --> 00:00:59,809
Yeah. Now we're gonna
have to figure out

24
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,933
why this guy lost his head.

25
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:05,504
Jose Cortez, 30,
from Sunset Park.

26
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,740
Cops found him in possession
of a half-ounce of cocaine.

27
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,042
Criminal possession
in the third degree.

28
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,811
But Cortez has no priors,
so he's eligible

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,212
for judicial diversion.

30
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:17,482
So he'll get drug treatment
instead of jail time.

31
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:19,629
And Schneiderman is on deck, so
no doubt she'll recommend rehab.

32
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:21,664
You run a triple I check
to make sure he doesn't have

33
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:22,954
a record outside of New York?

34
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:25,524
His record's clean.
Legal aid's gonna ask for R.O.R.

35
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,192
What do you want to do?

36
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,593
I'll ask for 500 bail.

37
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:30,095
She'll R.O.R. him anyway.

38
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:31,496
And so it goes.

39
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,176
All right, well, you seem to
have everything under control.

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,299
You need anything from me?

41
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,368
A raise.

42
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:37,836
Get in line.

43
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:43,875
You want some breakfast?

44
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:46,545
Kale and protein powder?
I think I'll pass.

45
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,024
If you show me what's under
that robe, I'll make you

46
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:49,648
whatever you want.
- Well, in that case,

47
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:52,684
you're gonna have to produce
some pretty killer pancakes.

48
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:54,319
Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:58,256
Wish I didn't have court.

50
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:01,593
Mm. It's better than being stuck
in Jersey traffic.

51
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,395
No, I mean, I wish
I could come with you.

52
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:05,063
It's no biggie.

53
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:06,910
Telling your mom that
we're engaged is a biggie.

54
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,511
- Mm...
- Plus, I haven't even met her yet.

55
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:10,936
Exactly. Let's keep it that way.

56
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:12,004
What does that mean?

57
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:15,440
My mother has scared off

58
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,043
every boyfriend
I've ever introduced her to.

59
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:20,078
I'm not every boyfriend.

60
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:22,948
Well, then you'll see
for yourself when you meet her.

61
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,282
At the wedding.

62
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,519
Ridiculous.

63
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,569
Eddie, great news. My court date
got pushed to tomorrow.

64
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:34,059
Oh.

65
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,294
- I can come with you.
- Wait, what?

66
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:38,330
Yeah, I'll just take the
day and come with you.

67
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,532
No, definitely not.

68
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:46,738
Invisibility.
Definitely invisibility.

69
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:48,907
No, man. Spidey-sense.

70
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:51,343
Then, you get fair warning
when something's gonna go down.

71
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:53,645
How about X-ray vision?

72
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:56,381
Ugh, no. There are things
I don't want to see.

73
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,451
I've always had a thing
for the Lasso of Truth.

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,454
Come in handy when we make detective.

75
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:13,131
Hey, why do you guys
always weigh the brain?

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,666
To see how much they weigh.

77
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:17,502
Actually, it's to look
for abnormalities.

78
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:18,970
This one is

79
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,438
three pounds
of memories, emotions

80
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:23,041
and 86 billion nerve cells.

81
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:23,419
Hmm.

82
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,900
I've always wondered about the
part that controls your emotion.

83
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:27,612
Oh, the amygdala.

84
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,614
Kind of wish I could have it
removed sometimes.

85
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:31,060
Yeah, but then you'd
be a serial killer.

86
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,228
Uh, what can you
tell us about

87
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:33,596
the head you found
at the garbage dump?

88
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,755
I'm waiting on DNA, but the time
of death and the injuries

89
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,757
are consistent
with that headless corpse

90
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,392
you guys brought me
a few weeks ago.

91
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,661
You mean the one belonging
to Luis Delgado?

92
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,896
That body wasn't Luis Delgado.

93
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,298
What are you talking about?

94
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:49,167
That body and the head that
you pulled out from the garbage

95
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,236
this morning appear
to belong to the same person.

96
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:52,904
No, the body
we found on the beach

97
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:55,974
with Luis Delgado's clothes on
and Luis Delgado's tattoos

98
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:57,542
belong to Luis Delgado.

99
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,877
Trust me.

100
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,680
I had to get dental records
from Mexico to confirm.

101
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:03,949
Great. Then the son of a bitch

102
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:06,551
who burned down my house
is still alive.

103
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,765
What is it?

104
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:24,169
Two officers sitting
on a witness's house

105
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:26,938
were shot multiple times
inside their patrol car.

106
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,239
Both critical.

107
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,875
- Anyone likely?
- Information's still coming in.

108
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:32,978
They're at Saint Irene's.

109
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,346
And the shooter?

110
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:35,480
No word yet.

111
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:38,483
Frank, one of the officers

112
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:41,286
is Abigail's husband.

113
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:06,309

115
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,999
Hey.

116
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:27,867
Two cops were shot
in their patrol car.

117
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,096
I heard. Any word
on their condition?

118
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,131
Still waiting. But Erin,

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,500
they just picked up
the shooter.

120
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,469
It's Jose Cortez.

121
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,039
The guy we released
this morning?

122
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:42,074
He went straight from
arraignment court

123
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,643
to his apartment,
he picked up a .45

124
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,847
and he opened fire. He's got
a record for murder and assault.

125
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,316
No. His rap sheet came up empty.

126
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:51,751
It came up empty
in our system

127
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,387
because his priors
were in Mexico.

128
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,223
Anthony, this is my fault.

129
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,557
No.

130
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,960
Your A.D.A. followed
the bail recommendations

131
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,961
to the letter.

132
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,195
Tell that to the two cops

133
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,797
laying in the hospital.

134
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,805
Officer Davis is out of surgery.

135
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,940
He's in recovery.

136
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,276
Brian took a bullet to his neck,

137
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,244
which severed his jugular.

138
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,185
Did I ever show you
Brian's department photo?

139
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:10,029
You're not supposed to,
but... he smiled.

140
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:12,364
On purpose.

141
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,767
He said every time
you see a cop shot

142
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,502
on the front page of the paper,

143
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:20,039
it's always the official photo
and they look so serious.

144
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,508
He figured if he smiled,
it was...

145
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,011
some sort of guarantee that
nothing bad would happen to him.

146
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,651
He might be right.

147
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,022
I've promised him all kinds
of things if he gets better.

148
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,410
Brian,

149
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
it's Commissioner Reagan.

150
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:25,004
Whatever it takes, Abigail.

151
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,410
I'm telling you,

152
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,612
Delgado had this guy
made up to look like him,

153
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,147
even down to the tattoo,

154
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,815
so he could pull
one over on us.

155
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,019
Mano Sangriento is all over
Long Island and Manhattan now.

156
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,087
- They all use the black hand.
- He played us.

157
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:45,291
I've checked every ship
and airline passenger list.

158
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,458
I don't think he left town.

159
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,793
Look, it's been weeks, okay?

160
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,795
He could be anywhere by
now, including Mexico.

161
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,530
Just speak to the DEA.

162
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,243
See if they'll give you
anything they got on him.

163
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,379
I'll check the warrant my sister
gave me on his cell phone

164
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,603
and see if that
turns anything up.

165
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,947
I think someone else
should find Delgado.

166
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,548
It's way too personal

167
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,584
between you and him.
I'm not gonna go

168
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,463
off the rails, if that's
what you're thinking, okay?

169
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,420
I promise.

170
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:15,521
You already did.

171
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,489
Do you really want to put us
in the crosshairs?

172
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,902
Look, I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch,

173
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,259
no matter what it takes.

174
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,964
You don't want
to be a part of that,

175
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,433
then I suggest
you walk away on this one.

176
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,668
You really want me to walk away?

177
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,856
Mom.

178
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:52,258
Hi.

179
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,660
Hi.

180
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,729
- Hmm.
- This is Jamie.

181
00:09:58,438 --> 00:09:58,879
Hi.

182
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,400
You didn't tell me
you were bringing someone.

183
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,446
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Jamie Reagan. Nice to meet you.

184
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,569
How do you do?

185
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,638
Very well.

186
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,606
You're welcome.

187
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,941
Um...
Can I steal this?

188
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,276
Yes, no problem.

189
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:18,050
So...

190
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,385
are you dating?

191
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,954
Is this, like,
a new boyfriend?

192
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:24,189
Uh, he-he's my fiancé.

193
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:27,293
Fiancé?

194
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,361
And this is the first time
I'm meeting you?

195
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,263
Well, we didn't
really <i>date</i> date.

196
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:32,364
You didn't date?

197
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,543
What he means
is we've known each other

198
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,833
for a long time.

199
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,535
We were partners on the job.

200
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:39,045
So you're a cop.

201
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:40,439
He's a sergeant.

202
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,544
He went to Harvard.

203
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,814
A quarter of a million dollars
in tuition

204
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,849
and you decided to be a cop.

205
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,062
Well, my whole family's
in law enforcement,

206
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,786
so I guess it was in the blood.

207
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,888
It's too bad doctor or lawyer
wasn't in the blood.

208
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,222
Then you two could

209
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,025
actually afford
a nice lifestyle.

210
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,694
We love our lifestyle, Mom.

211
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,895
Do you own a house?

212
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,530
I have an apartment.

213
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:05,798
Eddie likes being in the city.

214
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,233
- "Eddie"?
- No one calls me Edit, Mom.

215
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,936
I do. Your father does.

216
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,272
Well, I like Eddie.

217
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,808
So, you use a boy's name
and he uses a girl's name.

218
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,709
Mom.

219
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,911
I'm just saying.

220
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,946
That's okay.
My real name's Jameson.

221
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,214
Like the whiskey.

222
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,083
Yeah, like the whiskey.

223
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,552
It's a good thing your parents
didn't like to drink Smirnoff.

224
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,154
- Mom.
- What?

225
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,793
So, Reagan, is that, is that
any relation to...

226
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,473
The police commissioner,
yes, he's my dad.

227
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,698
What?

228
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,800
You must see the humor
in this, Edit.

229
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,435
Your father's in jail,

230
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:46,538
and you're marrying
the police commissioner's son.

231
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:51,076
That's going to make for some
very interesting conversation

232
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,178
at the wedding reception,
don't you think?

233
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,489
Looks like Davis has permanent
nerve damage to his hand.

234
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,358
His shooting hand,

235
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:07,875
so he'll be off
the street for good.

236
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,629
Well, not necessarily.

237
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,664
Not with the kind of things
they can do today.

238
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,733
And Brian Baker?

239
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,569
Still the same.

240
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,638
A.D.A. Reagan, boss.

241
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,178
Erin.

242
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,546
Garrett. Sid.

243
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,348
- Erin.
- How's Brian?

244
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,350
Still unconscious.

245
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,153
It's a waiting game right now.

246
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,555
And Abigail?

247
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:39,258
Abigail hasn't left his side.

248
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,130
Where's your boss?

249
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,368
He's not coming.

250
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:54,573
Okay.

251
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:57,209
I'll be in my office, boss.

252
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,486
Cortez was my case.
I supervised it.

253
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,388
It was my responsibility.

254
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,458
What were you thinking
letting him walk?

255
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,593
He didn't walk.
He made bail.

256
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:17,329
Bail was set at 500 bucks, Erin.
Of course he walked.

257
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,565
That's chump change
for a drug dealer.

258
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:23,235
The arrest was
for a nonviolent drug charge.

259
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,937
We are not in the business
of asking

260
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,840
for high bail because we think
someone <i>might</i> become dangerous.

261
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:32,010
He has a felony record
in Mexico: murder, assault.

262
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,047
My office didn't have access
to that information.

263
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,350
So the D.A.'s office

264
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,419
is in a rush to hold his hand,

265
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,655
and he goes out
and shoots two of my cops.

266
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,892
What do you want me to say, Dad?

267
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:50,462
The department policy is to ask
for little or no bail

268
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,564
for nonviolent crimes.

269
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,267
The policy has had success.

270
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,136
Not so much.

271
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:23,529
Where is he?

272
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,931
I don't know who
you're talking about.

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,232
The guy you're
standing next to

274
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,968
in the painting over
there. Where is he?

275
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,274
- Uh-uh.
- No...

276
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,509
Don't even think about it.

277
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:38,777
You're trespassing.

278
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:40,245
You broke into <i>my</i> house.

279
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,981
You mean like
your husband trespassed

280
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,183
when he burned my house down?

281
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,852
Mom?

282
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:48,954
Is everything okay?

283
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,791
Go back inside.

284
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,828
- Where's your phone?
- In the kitchen.

285
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,330
Let's go get it.

286
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,235
Your husband's making a lot
of money terrorizing people.

287
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:04,937
Who's terrorizing who?

288
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,438
Get the phone.
Pick it up.

289
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,440
Call your husband.
Come on.

290
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,309
Turn around.

291
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,778
Don't do anything crazy.

292
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,216
Luis?

293
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,119
Hey, remember me?

294
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,055
Where's Isabel?
She's right here.

295
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,834
Kids are here, too.
But don't worry, they're safe.

296
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,925
Unless, of course,
I decide to burn your house down

297
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,293
like you burned down mine.

298
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,595
If you harm them,

299
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,731
I swear I'll kill you.

300
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,467
Well, then you better
hurry up and get home.

301
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:36,635
Sit down.

302
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,869
Officer Davis took a bullet
to his right hand,

303
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,970
which has caused
permanent nerve damage.

304
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:55,957
Officer Baker was hit
with a bullet in his neck,

305
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,959
which punctured his jugular.

306
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:02,697
The bullet was removed, but he
has not regained consciousness.

307
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:05,032
We will have updates
as things progress.

308
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:07,735
What about the shooter?

309
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:09,303
Uh, the shooter,
Jose Cortez,

310
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:11,572
was apprehended
shortly after the shooting.

311
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:13,074
He has been charged

312
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:14,809
with attempted murder
in the first degree

313
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:17,011
and will be arraigned
later this afternoon.

314
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,347
Initial reports said Cortez
had been arrested before,

315
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:21,048
but released on bail.
- That's correct.

316
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,317
He was arrested for
drug possession

317
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:24,986
and released on bail
this morning.

318
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,054
Why was he released on bail?

319
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:28,489
The nonviolent nature
of his crimes

320
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:30,558
and the lack
of prior criminal history.

321
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:31,763
Why was he released
in the first place?

322
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,314
He was
a member of Mano Sangriento.

323
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,320
Mr. Cortez had
no criminal history

324
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,488
or gang affiliation
on record.

325
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,156
It was handled

326
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:41,225
as a first-time offense.

327
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,759
What do you mean, "on record"?

328
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,428
Mr. Cortez had
a prior record in Mexico

329
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:48,490
that did not come up
on the initial background check.

330
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,424
In light of what happened,
is the D.A.'s office

331
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:51,792
going to rethink this policy?

332
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:55,963
The policy was established
to decrease overcrowded prisons

333
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:57,565
filled with
nonviolent offenders.

334
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:01,168
In this regard,
the policy is a success.

335
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:04,438
The NYPD has two good officers
in the hospital,

336
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,932
one facing disability,

337
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:09,168
one may not survive.

338
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,670
Asking for minimum bail

339
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,939
for felonies
puts my officers

340
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:15,741
and, more importantly,

341
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,343
our citizens at risk,

342
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,479
because these criminals
will then be incentivized

343
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,782
to go out and commit more,

344
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,517
worse crimes.

345
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,552
And that is exactly
what happened today.

346
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:30,289
That's all.

347
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,590
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

348
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:39,843
I don't know how you
actually thought

349
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:41,111
you could avoid me
meeting your mother.

350
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:43,402
Oh, I was doing a great job
avoiding until today.

351
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:45,282
Eddie, you've met my whole
family; they're not perfect.

352
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:48,040
You have... you know, you have
a Norman Rockwell family.

353
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,254
You go to church on Sundays,
and you eat together on Sundays.

354
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,977
Just please don't.

355
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:54,046
Just saying, it doesn't
bother me what she says.

356
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,715
She just has no filter.

357
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,950
And she only cares

358
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,485
about money.

359
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:01,665
Eddie, do you know why we have
family dinner every Sunday?

360
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,055
No. Why?

361
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,092
Because my grandmother grew up
poor in a small town in Ireland.

362
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,726
She was the oldest of 12 kids,

363
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,462
and there was never
enough to eat.

364
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,464
She moved to New York
to make money.

365
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:13,632
She met my grandpa, and
when they got married,

366
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,279
she promised herself
that they would always

367
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,036
have more than enough to eat.

368
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,537
Family dinner was

369
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:21,407
just her way of proudly
proving that every week.

370
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:27,913
That meal was so important to
her because of how she grew up.

371
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,282
I'm just saying, there must be
some deep-seated reason

372
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:32,384
why your mother is
so obsessed about money.

373
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:36,188
My mother <i>chooses</i> to insult me

374
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:39,692
and to insult every person
I've ever brought home.

375
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,144
Yeah.
Leave the car there

376
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,678
and walk to the garage.

377
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:13,692
Welcome home.

378
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,127
Come on in.

379
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,030
Right over there.

380
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,502
Keep your hands where

381
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:25,804
I can see 'em.
Where's my wife and my boys?

382
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,941
Why'd you set my house on fire?

383
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,420
You're really pretending
to be an innocent victim?

384
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:32,878
- Who gave you the order?
- Doesn't matter.

385
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:34,813
You think if you
take him down, it's over?

386
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,515
You guys thought
you got El Chapo.

387
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,751
There's 20 guys lining up
to be the next El Chapo.

388
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,619
That's how
these organizations work.

389
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:43,455
How this works is that I'm
gonna find every son of a bitch

390
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,758
who had a hand in setting
my house on fire,

391
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:48,038
and I'm not gonna stop until
every one of them's behind bars,

392
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,395
or worse.

393
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:51,063
That's how it works.

394
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,798
Won't bring your wife back.

395
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:56,268
You have two sons.

396
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:59,405
You really want
to put them in danger?

397
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:04,043
Baez, I got Delgado.

398
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,144
Request a 10-85

399
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:08,380
to 12 Bayview Avenue.

400
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:09,726
You're under arrest.
Turn around.

401
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,084
Put your hands
behind your back.

402
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,123
You made a big mistake.

403
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:20,226
You're the one making
a mistake, bro.

404
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:21,827
- I'm one of you.
- Yeah?

405
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,395
How's that?

406
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,165
I'm working for the DEA.

407
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,815
We have you

408
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,583
for the murder
of Melissa Sanchez.

409
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,485
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

410
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:48,787
You told me you killed her
and her unborn baby.

411
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,789
I told you
I didn't think she was okay.

412
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,858
As it turns out, I was right.

413
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,561
She wasn't okay. She was dead.

414
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,964
And Manny Sanchez.

415
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:02,735
Reagan, what do you think
you're doing?

416
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,403
What the hell do you think
<i>you're</i> doing?

417
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,904
Can I talk to you outside?

418
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:14,625
What the hell are you doing
here? And more importantly,

419
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,581
what the hell
are you doing working

420
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,349
with a scumbag like Delgado?

421
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:18,929
- We made a deal with him.
- Yeah, I know you did.

422
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:20,686
You made a deal
with a cold-blooded killer

423
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:23,055
who murdered an innocent woman
and her unborn baby.

424
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:26,258
Delgado's a hired hand.
We're after José Rojas.

425
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,527
His boss. <i>La Almeja.</i> The Clam.

426
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,863
- Okay.
- Delgado is a hired gun.

427
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:35,167
Rojas has murdered or ordered
the murder of hundreds.

428
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:38,137
Okay? We get Rojas,
we bring down the organization.

429
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:39,471
Great, then go get him.

430
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,340
I already got Delgado.
He's mine.

431
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:43,509
No, you're gonna back off.

432
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:44,843
Go to hell.

433
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:48,080
Look, I get that this
has gotten personal for you.

434
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:49,593
- Don't go there.
- Okay, but we don't need you

435
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:52,951
going in there, being a hothead,
blowing our case.

436
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,287
I arrested Delgado.
It's my collar.

437
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,601
- Are you kidding me right now?
- I got him on murder charges. Okay?

438
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,125
That trumps any drug charge
you could possibly get.

439
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,061
So unless you want
to go before a judge

440
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:03,896
and try to get him
to give you a writ for me

441
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:05,776
to turn him over to the feds,
so be it. You go do that.

442
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
But until such time,
Delgado's mine.

443
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,335
He stays here with me.

444
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:11,337
Hey.

445
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:14,406
What?

446
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:16,208
Maybe we can work together
on this.

447
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:18,577
Well, it's the only way

448
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,746
we're both gonna get
what we want.

449
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:30,871
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts,.

450
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:32,962
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

451
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:36,032
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

452
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:48,966
You mind, uh, passing
me the mac and cheese?

453
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,481
Sure.

454
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:52,415
Here you go.

455
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:53,583
Looks good.

456
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:56,619
And what's the matter
with Daniel?

457
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:58,755
Nothing.

458
00:22:58,823 --> 00:23:00,501
Well, you're not piling food
onto your plate,

459
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,025
so it must be something.

460
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:03,626
Well, I kind of lost my appetite

461
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:05,673
when I learned that the guy
who burned our house down

462
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:07,630
cut a deal with the DEA.

463
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,432
You know who burned
our house down?

464
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:12,068
Yeah.
We'll talk about it later.

465
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:15,438
In the meantime, that guy's
walking around free as a bird.

466
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:17,573
Well, you could always
blame the D.A.'s office.

467
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:20,643
It seems to be the common
dumping ground around here.

468
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:22,845
No one's dumping

469
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:24,313
on the D.A.'s office.

470
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:25,648
You saw

471
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:27,016
the joint press conference.

472
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:29,085
System's broken.
Somebody had to call it out.

473
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:30,594
And here I thought
a press conference

474
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,121
was for dispensing information,

475
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,624
not calling people out.
My mistake.

476
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:37,026
Well, last I heard,
you commit a crime,

477
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:39,362
you suffer the consequences,
end of story.

478
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,731
You know how many times
you and Jamie have come to me

479
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,566
for a search warrant
or a subpoena,

480
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:45,535
and you haven't had everything
to get it?

481
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:46,769
Yeah, about as many times

482
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,204
as you've said no.

483
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:49,939
I'm sorry,
I still don't understand.

484
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:51,707
If you know who burned
our house down,

485
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,443
then why is he
still walking?

486
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:55,878
It's something called
judicial perversion.

487
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,146
Judicial diversion.

488
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:58,648
It's a policy

489
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:01,651
where nonviolent offenders
get reduced bail

490
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:04,921
and rehab, community service
instead of jail time.

491
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:07,690
It's called
mollycoddling criminals.

492
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,036
- Exactly.
- Is there anything

493
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,993
that you guys don't blame
on the attorneys?

494
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:12,395
Well, I'm afraid at the moment,

495
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:14,263
there happens
to be plenty to blame.

496
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:15,332
Amen to that.

497
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:16,777
That's what you get for having

498
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:19,302
a liberal D.A.
and a liberal mayor.

499
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,003
Like cops don't
make mistakes?

500
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:23,339
Nobody's saying that.

501
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:24,919
To be fair, I understand
why he got a reduced bail.

502
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:27,310
His arrest wasn't
for a large felony weight.

503
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:29,679
Well, how about his affiliation
with an illegal gang?

504
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:32,081
Or his criminal record?

505
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,483
His criminal record
in Mexico

506
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,585
doesn't come up in
a background check.

507
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:37,064
It would if you ran him
through Interpol.

508
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:39,055
Why would I run
a low-level drug dealer

509
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,124
through Interpol?

510
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:41,190
Why wouldn't you?

511
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,964
You know, when I first started
coming to these family dinners

512
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:51,300
and you guys would argue,
I would get really nervous

513
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:54,670
'cause I thought maybe you'd
never talk to each other again.

514
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:56,439
But...

515
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:58,040
you do.

516
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:00,943
You just keep talking.

517
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:03,713
Come hell or high water.

518
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:05,248
You saying we talk too much?

519
00:25:05,316 --> 00:25:07,783
No.

520
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:09,452
Well, don't worry, Eddie.

521
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,455
No matter what you do,
you're golden at this table.

522
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,390
I am?

523
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:17,226
As long as you wear NYPD blue.

524
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:39,549
I didn't know
you were coming here.

525
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:41,050
Edit never called me.

526
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,186
I didn't tell her.

527
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:45,354
May I come in?

528
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:52,828
I bet she's mad at me.

529
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:54,063
Well, why wouldn't she be?

530
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:55,631
She came to give you
some good news,

531
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,966
and you rained on her parade.

532
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:59,602
The good news would've been
she's marrying someone

533
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,471
who could afford to give her
the life that she's used to.

534
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,806
And what life would that be?

535
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,442
One where your husband's
in prison for fraud

536
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,311
and she wants to cut you
out of her life?

537
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,146
She should be grateful.

538
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,914
We gave her everything.

539
00:26:11,983 --> 00:26:14,517
Your husband cheated people
out of their savings.

540
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:17,553
You insulted every guy
she ever brought around.

541
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:19,288
I tell the truth.

542
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:20,890
And the truth about me
is I don't make

543
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,858
enough money? I'm
the wrong religion?

544
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:24,004
I live in the wrong borough?

545
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:25,161
I won't apologize

546
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,796
for wanting what's best
for my daughter.

547
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:29,384
- I'm what's best for your daughter.
- Oh, because you love her?

548
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:32,034
And that's gonna
take care of the bills?

549
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:35,171
I live a comfortable life,
and my family will, too.

550
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,540
Will it meet your standards?
I don't know.

551
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,976
But my family
will always come first.

552
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,478
That sounds great
on a Hallmark card.

553
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:44,480
But in reality?

554
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,251
Not so much.

555
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:53,022
I don't want Edit to end up...

556
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,357
Like you did?

557
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:57,260
Maybe you need to see the world

558
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:58,694
through a different set
of glasses.

559
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:02,632
Well, I certainly don't trust
the rose-colored ones you wear.

560
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,934
You haven't tried them on yet.

561
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:17,179
I'm in the middle
of pretrial hearings, Pop.

562
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:21,083
You call me
out here for this.

563
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:23,686
I made you your
favorite sandwich.

564
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,756
Thank you. Now,
what are we doing out here?

565
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:28,090
Getting you out
of the office.

566
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,760
My office is not
the problem. Dad is.

567
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:33,229
Oh, is he, now? Why?

568
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,031
'Cause he says
what he feels?

569
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:37,433
In front of
millions of viewers

570
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:39,669
at my first press conference
as bureau chief?

571
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:41,237
Yeah, he could've
tempered it down.

572
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:43,039
You mean watered it down?

573
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,674
Whatever you want
to call it.

574
00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:46,208
You're upset because

575
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:48,477
he talked like the
police commissioner

576
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:49,912
and not your father.

577
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:52,915
I don't see how he could've
handled it any other way.

578
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,717
Of course you're gonna
take his side.

579
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:56,319
I'm not taking sides.

580
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:59,355
Why are you taking this
so personally?

581
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:04,393
I can take the slings and arrows
from other attorneys

582
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:06,395
and the D.A.
and even the press, but...

583
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:07,897
But not your father?

584
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:09,732
He was criticizing

585
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:12,568
the D.A.'s office, not you.

586
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:13,781
That's not what it felt like,

587
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,238
and I was the one up there
taking the heat.

588
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:18,541
You're confusing work
and family.

589
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,943
Your father

590
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:24,080
has the right to disagree
with the D.A.--

591
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:25,848
yes, in public,

592
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:29,385
and yes, even with you
standing there next to him--

593
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:32,722
because it's his job.

594
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,758
But no matter what happens,

595
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:39,095
you'll always have his love
and support.

596
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:47,103
Every time you leave the house,
you have to call first

597
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:48,437
to say where you're going.

598
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:49,817
If you're gonna be late
getting back

599
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:50,973
or your train is delayed,

600
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,619
your car breaks down,
you need to call us

601
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,043
with the details.

602
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:56,512
Then I should tell you
the coke and fentanyl exchange

603
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:57,847
may be going down tonight.

604
00:28:57,915 --> 00:28:59,682
<i>"May</i> be going down tonight"?
I'll get a call

605
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:01,283
this afternoon to confirm.

606
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:02,385
Where?

607
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:03,586
The old candy factory.

608
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,454
I don't know how many people.

609
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:08,190
Usually six or seven total.
Members of the Double Treys,

610
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:10,526
Mano Sangriento, me.

611
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,039
Good. Now we know
where it's going down.

612
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:14,130
So we don't need him to do this.

613
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:16,499
Rojas expects me to be
there to handle the money.

614
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,468
If he finds out I'm not,
he'll be in the wind.

615
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:20,537
Don't trust him.

616
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:25,141
Wipe that smile off your face.

617
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:27,289
That's hard to do 'cause
you're so damn entertaining.

618
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:29,959
- Danny. Danny.
- Reagan! Reagan!

619
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:31,947
Outside.

620
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:35,985
Now!

621
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:37,987
<i>This is too personal for you</i>

622
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,423
and you cannot handle this...
- It's not personal.

623
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:42,458
I don't trust the son
of a bitch, okay?

624
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:44,393
Well, we're on it.

625
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:46,662
- You don't know how that guy works.
- No?

626
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:49,398
35 years ago,
my father crossed the border

627
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:51,634
to get away
from Mano Sangriento.

628
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,869
Okay, when he finally had
enough money,

629
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:56,806
he went back to get the rest
of his family.

630
00:29:56,874 --> 00:30:00,676
Sangriento had killed
every last one of them.

631
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,978
So...

632
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:04,747
don't tell me I don't know him.

633
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,782
Look, I'm sorry.

634
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,784
I am.

635
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:12,065
But you're playing with fire,
trusting this guy.

636
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,522
You're the one playing
with fire,

637
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:15,524
letting him get to you
like that.

638
00:30:15,593 --> 00:30:16,859
You either play by my rules,

639
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:18,861
or you get the hell off my team.

640
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:43,185
Okay. We got Delgado.

641
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:46,689
Amigo.

642
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:13,215
I know where you live.

643
00:31:13,284 --> 00:31:14,917
On my signal, we're gonna go.

644
00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:17,854
One.

645
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:20,423
Two.

646
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:22,970
Wait a minute.
Where the hell is he going?

647
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,527
I don't know. His
car's in the front.

648
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,896
What the hell is he doing?

649
00:31:26,964 --> 00:31:28,030
- Three.
- No. Wait.

650
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,266
No, wait! No!
Go, go, go.

651
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,235
Move, move!

652
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:36,338
Hey. It's a setup. Hold on!

653
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,875
Hey!

654
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:50,853
Help! Help me! Help me!

655
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:54,657
Come here, come here.

656
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:56,725
Hang on!

657
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:01,530
Baez, it's pepper spray!

658
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:10,539
It's pepper spray!

659
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:26,622
Delgado?!

660
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:38,968
Delgado?

661
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:57,286
Aah!

662
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,180
It's a didgeridoo.

663
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:31,049
An Australian wind instrument,
a little bit like a trumpet.

664
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:33,051
Oh.

665
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,520
Thank you.

666
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,490
It's a gift from
the prime minister of Australia

667
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,025
for hosting him last week.

668
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:44,496
A donation to the NYPD Museum?

669
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:48,367
Brian's doing better.

670
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:51,136
He is, thank you.

671
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:53,338
Thought you weren't coming in
for a few weeks.

672
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,974
I told Jimmy
I'd relieve him for a few hours.

673
00:33:56,043 --> 00:33:57,309
I could use the break.

674
00:33:57,378 --> 00:34:00,545
Things are bad
if work's a break.

675
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,881
Actually, things are very good.

676
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,083
Brian is breathing on his own,

677
00:34:05,152 --> 00:34:07,219
he's complaining
about hospital food,

678
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:10,188
and they're gonna release him
tomorrow.

679
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:13,225
Good news.

680
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:15,027
Well, maybe you should

681
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,195
rethink that no-smile policy.

682
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:26,638
I have accompanied you
on many, many hospital visits

683
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:30,342
to officers who have been
injured in the line of duty,

684
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:33,545
some who have died
in the line of duty.

685
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:36,114
I knew it was your job.

686
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:40,218
What I never fully understood
was just how important

687
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,255
your visit is
to the officer's family.

688
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:51,129
And now I know.

689
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:54,433
Thank you.

690
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:09,781
Son of a bitch, he set us up.
I told you not to trust him.

691
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,049
We don't know that yet.

692
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:12,451
Of course he set us up.

693
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,898
He got the hell out of there
right before the boxes exploded.

694
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:17,322
- How the hell would he know?!
- He knew what was coming.

695
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,510
Then why did he go back
to his apartment?

696
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,534
What?

697
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:22,661
Look at the ankle monitor.

698
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,296
It proves that he's there.

699
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:25,964
Then, what happened?

700
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:28,144
- Well, I'll let you know after I see him.
- No, no, no, no.

701
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,735
You'll let 'em know
after <i>we</i> see him.

702
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:31,069
We're going with you.

703
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:38,010
Let's go.

704
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:49,121
Delgado? Police!

705
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,356
I thought the GPS said
he was here.

706
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:52,858
It did.

707
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:55,027
It's Agent Molina, Luis.

708
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:56,461
We need to talk to you.

709
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,596
Luis?

710
00:35:57,664 --> 00:35:58,930
Please, come in.

711
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,609
You know, I'm glad you came.

712
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:12,022
Something I've been wanting
to tell you.

713
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:12,857
What's that?

714
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,881
You know your wife's
helicopter accident?

715
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:16,982
It really wasn't an accident.

716
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,850
It was all arranged
by Mano Sangriento,

717
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,586
because you started
playing games with them.

718
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,204
You son of a bitch.
Where the hell are you?

719
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,461
Where are you?!

720
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,341
You really shouldn't
play games with them.

721
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:32,365
And do you know why?

722
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,865
I don't give a damn why.

723
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:36,268
Because they always win.

724
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,571
Where are you, Delgado?

725
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:48,246
Real tough guy, huh?

726
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:49,481
Couldn't come face me?

727
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,349
Oh, I am facing you, Detective.

728
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,653
And you know what I see?
A loser.

729
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:58,156
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go mix myself a drink.

730
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,305
I'll get TARU in here,
run a trace on the video.

731
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,640
You told me
the GPS said he was here.

732
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:05,497
The son of a bitch isn't here!

733
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:07,766
It said that he was here.

734
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:24,416
Good one.

735
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:26,818
Hello?

736
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,220
Hey.

737
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,921
Eddie, uh, Mom and I--

738
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,256
we made dinner for you.

739
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:33,258
- My mom doesn't cook.
- What did I

740
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:34,593
always tell you, Edit?

741
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:36,228
"Forget the dishes on the shelf,

742
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,529
be a tasty dish yourself"?

743
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:42,234
So, we ordered takeout
from Balthazar's.

744
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,769
Want some wine?

745
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:46,071
Mm-hmm.

746
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,405
Okay.

747
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:53,612
She ordered from the most
expensive restaurant,

748
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,380
and we are gonna
foot the bill.

749
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:57,616
- Yeah, I know.
- You know?

750
00:37:57,684 --> 00:37:59,084
What were you thinking?

751
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:01,153
I thought it would be good
to make amends.

752
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:02,787
She brought the
family photo album?

753
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:04,322
Well, that was my idea.

754
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:06,158
Does it get better
if she has a few drinks?

755
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:08,527
Well, it gets better if we do.

756
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:12,998
Edit, your first bikini!

757
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,033
It's a good thing
you grew some boobs after that.

758
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,236
Who was that guy
that you went with?

759
00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:19,571
What was his name?

760
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,039
Oh. Stan.

761
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,574
Stan. That's right.

762
00:38:22,643 --> 00:38:25,477
His father was a cardiologist.

763
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:27,145
- What ever happened to him?
- Well,

764
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:30,115
Mom, uh, Stan became
a cardiologist, too,

765
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:32,184
and he lives in Boca.

766
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,618
- Ah.
- Oh. Nice boy.

767
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,321
I'll have a refill.
Yeah.

768
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,791
Mom, you scared off every boy
I ever brought home.

769
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,995
If they were all scared off,
then none of them deserve you.

770
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:46,031
Is that your excuse?

771
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,399
It's true.

772
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:50,068
They all ran, except for one.

773
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,541
He's the only one who came back.

774
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,559
I love you.

775
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,194
Something wrong?

776
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,296
No.

777
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,801
You've got

778
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:23,935
to see this, Jamie.

779
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:26,371
Eddie dressed as
Jessica Rabbit

780
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,273
for Halloween.

781
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,275
Ooh, I actually look
pretty hot in that one.

782
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:32,277
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Mm.

783
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:53,665
You already put the bait on?

784
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:56,201
- Thought I'd save you the trouble.
- It's a blood worm?

785
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,103
Sand worms.

786
00:39:58,171 --> 00:40:00,605
I would have gone
with herring.

787
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:02,974
You want me to put
on a bottom bait?

788
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:06,144
No, I didn't ask you to come
out here to valet the tackle.

789
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:08,146
Okay.

790
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:13,285
You know how old you were
when I taught you to fish?

791
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:15,220
- No.
- Seven.

792
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,756
Actually, I wasn't
gonna teach you at all,

793
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:19,891
even though I
taught the boys.

794
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,861
Because I was a girl?

795
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,096
No.

796
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,465
Because it is
the kind of activity

797
00:40:27,534 --> 00:40:30,201
where even
if you do everything perfectly,

798
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,038
there's no guarantee of a fish.

799
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:37,075
And what else is like that,
if I'm hearing you correctly?

800
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,111
Being a boss.

801
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,382
One slipup, and the searchlight
comes on hot and fast.

802
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:46,584
Tell me about it.

803
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:51,790
Pop told me I took
the press conference personally.

804
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:54,292
That I was expecting
you'd act more like

805
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:56,227
a protective father
than the PC.

806
00:40:56,296 --> 00:40:58,263
And what do you think?

807
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:01,666
That my mistake was acting
like a respectful daughter,

808
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:04,269
letting you have the last word.

809
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,374
And the next time?

810
00:41:09,443 --> 00:41:12,610
I will always
be respectful of you.

811
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,647
Couldn't be
any other way, but...

812
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:18,316
I need to respect
my office, too.

813
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:26,791
And maybe keep the joint press
conferences to a minimum.

814
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,894
Yeah. That, too.

815
00:41:31,465 --> 00:41:33,631
Ooh.

816
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,234
Well, what do you know.

817
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:38,236
Results.

818
00:41:52,472 --> 00:41:59,472
