But Cortez has no priors,

So he'll get drug treatment

no doubt she'll recommend rehab.

I'm telling you,

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,612
Delgado had this guy
made up to look like him,

165
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,147
even down to the tattoo,

166
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,815
so he could pull
one over on us.

167
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,019
Mano Sangriento is all over
Long Island and Manhattan now.

168
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,087
- They all use the black hand.
- He played us.

169
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:45,291
I've checked every ship
and airline passenger list.

170
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,458
I don't think he left town.

171

Look, it's been weeks, okay?

172
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,795
He could be anywhere by
now, including Mexico.

173
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,530
Just speak to the DEA.

174
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,243
See if they'll give you
anything they got on him.

175
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,379
I'll check the warrant my sister
gave me on his cell phone

00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,603

Yes, no problem.

202
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:18,050
So...

203
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,385
are you dating?

204
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,954
Is this, like,
a new boyfriend?

205

Uh, he-he's my fiancé.

206
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:27,293
Fiancé?

207
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,361
And this is the first time
I'm meeting you?

208
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,263
Well, we didn't
really <i>date</i> date.

209

You didn't date?

210
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,543
What he means
is we've known each other

211
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,833
for a long time.

212
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,535
We were partners on the job.

213
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:39,045
So you're a cop.

214
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:40,439
He's a sergeant.

215
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,544
He went to Harvard.

216
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,814
A quarter of a million dollars
in tuition

217
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,849
and you decided to be a cop.

218
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,062
Well, my whole family's
in law enforcement,

219
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,786
so I guess it was in the blood.

220
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,888
It's too bad doctor or lawyer
wasn't in the blood.

221
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,222
Then you two could

222
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,025
actually afford
a nice lifestyle.

223
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,694
We love our lifestyle, Mom.

224
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,895
Do you own a house?

225
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,530
I have an apartment.

226
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:05,798
Eddie likes being in the city.

227
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,233
- "Eddie"?
- No one calls me Edit, Mom.

228
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,936
I do. Your father does.

229

Well, I like Eddie.

230
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,808
So, you use a boy's name
and he uses a girl's name.

My real name's Jameson.

234
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,214
Like the whiskey.

235
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,083
Yeah, like the whiskey.

236

It's a good thing your parents
didn't like to drink Smirnoff.

- Mom.
- What?

238
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,793
So, Reagan, is that, is that
any relation to...

239
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,473

You must see the humor
in this, Edit.

243
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,435
Your father's in jail,

244
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:46,538
and you're marrying
the police commissioner's son.

245
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:51,076
That's going to make for some
very interesting conversation

Cortez was my case.
I supervised it.

268
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,388
It was my responsibility.

269

What were you thinking
letting him walk?

270
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,593
He didn't walk.
He made bail.

271
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:17,329
Bail was set at 500 bucks, Erin.
Of course he walked.

272
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,565
That's chump change
for a drug dealer.

273
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:23,235
The arrest was
for a nonviolent drug charge.

274
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,937
We are not in the business
of asking

275
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,840
for high bail because we think
someone <i>might</i> become dangerous.

276
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:32,010
He has a felony record
in Mexico: murder, assault.

277
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,047
My office didn't have access
to that information.

278
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,350
So the D.A.'s office

279
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,419
is in a rush to hold his hand,

280
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,655
and he goes out
and shoots two of my cops.

281
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,892
What do you want me to say, Dad?

282
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:50,462
The department policy is to ask
for little or no bail

283
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,564
for nonviolent crimes.

284
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,267
The policy has had success.

00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,731
I swear I'll kill you.

317
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,467
Well, then you better
hurry up and get home.

318
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:36,635
Sit down.

319
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,869
Officer Davis took a bullet
to his right hand,

320
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,970
which has caused
permanent nerve damage.

321
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:55,957
Officer Baker was hit
with a bullet in his neck,

322
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,959
which punctured his jugular.

323
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:02,697
The bullet was removed, but he
has not regained consciousness.

324
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:05,032
We will have updates
as things progress.

326
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:07,735
What about the shooter?

327
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:09,303
Uh, the shooter,
Jose Cortez,

328
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:11,572
was apprehended
shortly after the shooting.

329
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:13,074
He has been charged

330
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:14,809
with attempted murder
in the first degree

331
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:17,011
and will be arraigned
later this afternoon.

332
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,347
Initial reports said Cortez
had been arrested before,

333
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:21,048
but released on bail.
- That's correct.

334
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,317
He was arrested for
drug possession

335
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:24,986
and released on bail
this morning.

336
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,054
<b><font color="#808080">MAN:</font></b>
Why was he released on bail?

337
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:28,489
The nonviolent nature
of his crimes

338
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:30,558
and the lack
of prior criminal history.

339
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:31,763
Why was he released
in the first place?

340
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,314
He was
a member of Mano Sangriento.

341
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,320
Mr. Cortez had
no criminal history

342
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,488
or gang affiliation
on record.

343
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,156
It was handled

344
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:41,225
as a first-time offense.

345
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,759
What do you mean, "on record"?

346
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,428
Mr. Cortez had
a prior record in Mexico

347
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:48,490
that did not come up
on the initial background check.

348
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,424
In light of what happened,
is the D.A.'s office

349
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:51,792
going to rethink this policy?

350
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:55,963
The policy was established
to decrease overcrowded prisons

351
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:57,565
filled with
nonviolent offenders.

352
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:01,168
In this regard,
the policy is a success.

353
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:04,438
The NYPD has two good officers
in the hospital,

354
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,932
one facing disability,

355
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:09,168
one may not survive.

356
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,670
Asking for minimum bail

357
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,939
for felonies
puts my officers

358
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:15,741
and, more importantly,

359
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,343
our citizens at risk,

360
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,479
because these criminals
will then be incentivized

361
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,782
to go out and commit more,

362
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,517
worse crimes.

363
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,552
And that is exactly
what happened today.

I don't know how you

you could avoid me
meeting your mother.

369

Oh, I was doing a great job
avoiding until today.

Eddie, you've met my whole
family; they're not perfect.

371
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:48,040
You have... you know, you have
a Norman Rockwell family.

372
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,254
You go to church on Sundays,
and you eat together on Sundays.

373
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,977
Just please don't.

374
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:54,046
Just saying, it doesn't
bother me what she says.

375
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,715
She just has no filter.

376
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,950
And she only cares

377
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,485
about money.

378
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:01,665
Eddie, do you know why we have
family dinner every Sunday?

379
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,055
No. Why?

380
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,092
Because my grandmother grew up
poor in a small town in Ireland.

381
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,726
She was the oldest of 12 kids,

382
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,462
and there was never
enough to eat.

383
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,464
She moved to New York
to make money.

384
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:13,632
She met my grandpa, and
when they got married,

385
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,279
she promised herself
that they would always

386
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,036
have more than enough to eat.

387
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,537
Family dinner was

388
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:21,407
just her way of proudly
proving that every week.

389
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:27,913
That meal was so important to
her because of how she grew up.

390
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,282
I'm just saying, there must be
some deep-seated reason

391
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:32,384
why your mother is
so obsessed about money.

392
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:36,188
My mother <i>chooses</i> to insult me

635
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:03,586
The old candy factory.

I don't know how many people.

637
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:08,190
Usually six or seven total.
Members of the Double Treys,

638
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:10,526
Mano Sangriento, me.

Rojas expects me to be
there to handle the money.

my father crossed the border

from Mano Sangriento.

Okay, when he finally had
enough money,

658
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:56,806
he went back to get the rest
of his family.

659
00:29:56,874 --> 00:30:00,676
Sangriento had killed
every last one of them.

660
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,978
So...

Good one.

785
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:26,818
Hello?

786
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,220
<b><font color="#FF5500">(both laughing)</font></b>
Hey.

787
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,921
Eddie, uh, Mom and I--

788
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,256
we made dinner for you.

789
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:33,258
- My mom doesn't cook.
- What did I

790
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:34,593
always tell you, Edit?

791
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:36,228
"Forget the dishes on the shelf,

792
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,529
be a tasty dish yourself"?

793

<b><font color="#FF5500">(laughs)</font></b>

794
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:42,234
So, we ordered takeout
from Balthazar's.

795
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,602
<b><font color="#FF5500">(both laugh)</font></b>

796
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,769
Want some wine?

797
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:46,071
Mm-hmm.

798
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,405
Okay.

799
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:53,612
She ordered from the most
expensive restaurant,

800
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,380
and we are gonna
foot the bill.

801
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:57,616
- Yeah, I know.
- You know?

802
00:37:57,684 --> 00:37:59,084
What were you thinking?

803
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:01,153
I thought it would be good
to make amends.

804
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:02,787
She brought the
family photo album?

805
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:04,322
Well, that was my idea.

806
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:06,158
Does it get better
if she has a few drinks?

807
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:08,527
Well, it gets better if we do.

808
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:12,998
Edit, your first bikini!

809
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,033
It's a good thing
you grew some boobs after that.

810
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,236
Who was that guy
that you went with?

811
00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:19,571
What was his name?

812
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,039
Oh. Stan.

813
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,574
Stan. That's right.

814
00:38:22,643 --> 00:38:25,477
His father was a cardiologist.

815
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:27,145
- What ever happened to him?
- Well,

816
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:30,115
Mom, uh, Stan became
a cardiologist, too,

817
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:32,184
and he lives in Boca.

818
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,618
- Ah.
- Oh. Nice boy.

819
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,321
I'll have a refill.
Yeah.

820
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,791
Mom, you scared off every boy
I ever brought home.

821
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,995
If they were all scared off,
then none of them deserve you.

822
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:46,031
Is that your excuse?

823
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,399
It's true.

824
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:50,068
They all ran, except for one.

825
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,541
He's the only one who came back.

826
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,559
I love you.

827
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,194
Something wrong?

828
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,296
No.

829

<b><font color="#D09090">LENA:</font></b>

830

to see this, Jamie.

831
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:26,371
Eddie dressed as
Jessica Rabbit

832
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,273
for Halloween.

833
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,275
Ooh, I actually look
pretty hot in that one.

834
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:32,277
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Mm.

835
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:53,665
You already put the bait on?

836
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:56,201
- Thought I'd save you the trouble.
- It's a blood worm?

837
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,103
Sand worms.

838
00:39:58,171 --> 00:40:00,605
I would have gone
with herring.

839
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:02,974
You want me to put
on a bottom bait?

840
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:06,144
No, I didn't ask you to come
out here to valet the tackle.

841
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:08,146
Okay.

842
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:13,285
You know how old you were
when I taught you to fish?

843
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:15,220
- No.
- Seven.

844
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,756
Actually, I wasn't
gonna teach you at all,

845
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:19,891
even though I
taught the boys.

846
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,861
Because I was a girl?

847
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,096
No.

848
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,465
Because it is
the kind of activity

849
00:40:27,534 --> 00:40:30,201
where even
if you do everything perfectly,

850
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,038
there's no guarantee of a fish.

851
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:37,075
And what else is like that,
if I'm hearing you correctly?

852
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,111
Being a boss.

853
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,382
One slipup, and the searchlight
comes on hot and fast.

854
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:46,584
Tell me about it.

855
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:51,790
Pop told me I took
the press conference personally.

856
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:54,292
That I was expecting
you'd act more like

857
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:56,227
a protective father
than the PC.

858
00:40:56,296 --> 00:40:58,263
And what do you think?

859
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:01,666
That my mistake was acting
like a respectful daughter,

860
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:04,269
letting you have the last word.

861
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,374
And the next time?

862
00:41:09,443 --> 00:41:12,610
I will always
be respectful of you.

863
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,647
Couldn't be
any other way, but...

864
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:18,316
I need to respect
my office, too.

865
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:26,791
And maybe keep the joint press
conferences to a minimum.

866
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,894
Yeah. That, too.

867
00:41:31,465 --> 00:41:33,631
Ooh.

868
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,234
Well, what do you know.

869
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:38,236
