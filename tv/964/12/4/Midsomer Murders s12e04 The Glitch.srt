1
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:11,816
Watch your bike!

2
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:28,982
If you're going to ride like
maniacs, at least do it quietly!

3
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,102
It says in the guide books the
Valley of Midsomer Sanctae

4
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:38,542
has an atmosphere of calm, spiritual
repose! Fat chance!

5
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:49,662
Last refreshment stop before we turn
off the Ridgeway for Midsomer
Sanctae.

6
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:59,182
Have we heard from the National
Trust? It's all done. Portaloos too!

7
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,222
First things first, Daniel.

8
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,822
When you get to my age, Emily,

9
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:06,702
it really does all revolve around
where the next loo is.

10
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:10,902
Look down there, you young clowns!

11
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:13,382
Midsomer Sanctae.

12
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:16,622
A thousand years of history
you can see.

13
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:20,302
Maybe 2,000 more you can't see,
but you can feel.

14
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:24,822
Last one down's exterminated!

15
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:33,542
Come on. We'll surprise them.
I know a little shortcut!

16
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,902
This is it!
Is this what you call cheating?

17
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:54,782
No!

18
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,702
It's a handicap, like golf!

19
00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:11,062
Morning, sir.
Morning, Jones. You're early.

20
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:14,902
Or did you get in in the hope I
wouldn't witness this unusual event?

21
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:17,782
I have been on a bike before, sir.
Nice bit of kit, that.

22
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:20,302
Brand new, isn't it?
Yeah, doing the Pilgrims' Ride.

23
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:24,702
I wouldn't bet too much of your
salary, generous though it is,

24
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:27,902
on beating Stephens. Fit girl, that!
It's not a race, sir!

25
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,462
Yeah, I know.
I also know you, Jones.

26
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:35,102
Oh, bad tidings from Aspern Tallow.
Your Bucketman struck again.

27
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:36,062
Oh, bad tidings from Aspern Tallow.
Your Bucketman struck again.

28
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,422
No!

29
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:44,382
See no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.

30
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:48,142
Bucketman has turned law-abiding
villagers into the three wise
monkeys.

31
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:50,742
Oh, yeah. It's been three months now?

32
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:53,182
Yeah, and I'm no nearer catching him

33
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,942
than I was the first time he threw
a bucket over a sports car.

34
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:59,462
But there's nothing
I don't know about paint and glue.

35
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:03,462
It'll come in handy, sarge. Yeah, if
I want a job as a paint salesman.

36
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,822
Don't worry, you're not going to be
fired just yet.

37
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:08,862
You get the Bucketman...
by this weekend

38
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,622
and your job will be safe.

39
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:15,422
Mind you, the latest victim,
he's shouting very very loudly.

40
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:18,302
We're not taking it seriously.
We're on the villagers' side.

41
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:21,142
We're turning a blind eye to it all.

42
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:23,502
That's what the villagers are saying
about us

43
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:26,022
not stopping their plague of boy
racers.

44
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:30,862
Yes, but he's been in touch with
the Chief Superintendent.

45
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:30,982
Yes, but he's been in touch with
the Chief Superintendent.

46
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,942
Take a look at that.

47
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:43,622
(WHOOPING)

48
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:49,422
Wey-hey!

49
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,342
How did you get here first?

50
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:53,822
Experience.

51
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:57,422
It's cool here, Dad.
I've always thought so.

52
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:59,502
So what went on here?

53
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:02,662
Well, for over 700 years

54
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,782
pilgrims gathered at Causton
to walk to this abbey,

55
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,822
to pray to St Frideswide
for blessings and help.

56
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:12,742
She was the daughter of an
Anglo-Saxon king,

57
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:15,942
but people prayed here long before
that.

58
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,342
The Romans had a shrine here.

59
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:20,222
Before them the Celts.

60
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:24,142
And I want plenty of prayers to St
Frideswide

61
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:27,142
for good weather on the day. Please!

62
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:31,542
She didn't do very well for us last
year, did she? It bucketed down.

63
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,142
Which reminds me, the Bucketman was
out again last night.

64
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,462
Was he?

65
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:01,382
We're heading back, Tom. Dad was
always on about this place
when I was a kid.

66
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,262
I sort of see it.

67
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:08,582
It means a lot to him that you're
here.

68
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,502
It's just a bike ride.

69
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:34,502
Ta.
Thank you.

70
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:57,342
DCI Barnaby?
That's me.

71
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:00,502
Yes, Mr Finn'll see you now.
Thank you.

72
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:15,462
Is that a smile, Barnaby?

73
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,862
Certainly not, sir. It's the
sunlight coming through the window.

74
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:20,662
I'm not amused.

75
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:23,022
But you wouldn't be here if you
didn't know that.

76
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:27,902
I'm here because you complained to
my Chief Superintendent.

77
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:31,142
And to assure you that we'll do
whatever we can

78
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,902
to catch whoever it was
attacked you.

79
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:37,822
In three months this Bucketman has
attacked four people, now five.

80
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:43,742
All employees of Soft Earth Systems
and drivers of very fast cars.

81
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:48,582
Look, just leave it!
Get it picked up later.

82
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,702
And what about this guy? Jones?

83
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:57,342
If he worked for me I'd have cut him
loose a long time ago.

84
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:59,782
You said you wanted more of the
paint, Sergeant.

85
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:03,382
Knock yourself out!

86
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:06,942
If you guys can't hack it, maybe
we should do something ourselves.

87
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:11,622
I do hope that's not a threat, sir.

88
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:14,742
Where's the car, Mr Finn?
I need to inspect the damage.

89
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,862
Auto repair shop in the village.
Guy called Snape.

90
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,662
Well, thank you very much, Mr Finn.

91
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:27,862
That will be all for now, thank you.

92
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,782
Yeah.

93
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:43,822
What? Well, how does it look?

94
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,862
If he's not there...

95
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:51,382
George has got to be there,
Jonathan! Sort it out!

96
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,542
He's adamant!
I can't twist his arm, Clinton!

97
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:59,702
'Well, then try breaking his damn
neck!' On the table.

98
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:21,302
They've been up the manor already,
talking to Mr Finn.

99
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,142
Livid, he is.

100
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:25,942
Whatever else you might say about
him, he had a nice head of hair.

101
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,902
'In quo corriget?'

102
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:30,942
'Wherewithal shall a young man
cleanse his way?'

103
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:35,262
Let's hope Mr Finn takes note.
At least one car's off the road.

104
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:37,742
I'm surprised you've given it
house room, Daniel.

105
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:40,662
Couldn't resist it, I'm afraid.
It's a beautiful machine,

106
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:43,662
in the hands of someone who can drive
it.

107
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:47,142
Detective Sergeant Jones, here to
investigate injury to my tandem!

108
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:49,502
Mr Wayland-Smith. Miss Harte.
Mr Snape.

109
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:52,902
I'm sure you all know why we're here.

110
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,262
It's not my tandem after all?

111
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:58,462
Clinton Finn has been dealt with by
another instrument of justice.

112
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:02,582
'Noli aemulari.' 'Fret not thyself
because of the ungodly.' I don't.

113
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:08,222
Have to dash. Back to school.

114
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,382
But I'm sure all my buckets are
accounted for.

115
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:15,582
Another paint sample for your
collection, Sergeant.

116
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,982
Devil's own job getting it off.
It's the glue.

117
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:20,422
Terribly sticky with paint.

118
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,382
Right...

119
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,902
Sorry, Jonathan. I forgot.

120
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,182
Well, you'd better tell him I'll be
late.

121
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:54,462
Was there some part of 'I won't be
coming to your press conference
tomorrow'

122
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:57,222
that needed elaboration?

123
00:12:57,222 --> 00:13:02,422
What needs elaborating is your
commitment to this university.

124
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:05,902
This place is here to give me the
opportunity to say what I like,

125
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:07,702
think what I like,
discover what I can,

126
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,662
or fail to do any of those things.

127
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:15,102
Of course it's true that without
your work

128
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:18,222
Soft Earth Systems wouldn't be
offering this money.

129
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:20,862
We all recognise that and applaud
it.

130
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:25,182
But this is about the university!
It's about intellectual integrity.

131
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:28,702
I invented Kernel Logic ten years
ago. I've discovered it's flawed.

132
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:31,382
So you say. And if I come to your
press conference,

133
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:34,022
I shall say that very loudly.
Is that what you want?

134
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:38,462
Do you know. Jonathan, you're almost
persuading me I should come.

135
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:44,502
Yes, Bains?
Dr Jeffers' new bicycle.

136
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:47,702
What?
Excellent!

137
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,102
Lead on!

138
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:52,862
I might even give you a spin round
the quad.

139
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:56,662
I don't think we handled that very
well at all, Jonathan, do you?

140
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:59,462
Hey hey hey!

141
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,957
Where have you been, Tom?
Out.

142
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:35,157
You've got time off for studying.
I don't see much evidence of it.

143
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:36,997
I rode to the abbey with the lads.
Ah.

144
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:43,197
Well, your father and Miss Muffet
got back hours ago.

145
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:46,037
Couldn't you keep up?

146
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:41,677
Oh!

147
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,437
Oh, walk right in!

148
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,317
Make yourself at home!

149
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,957
Everyone else seems to.
You said you'd talk to him.

150
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:21,917
Our son is out of control.

151
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,677
And I don't think his relationship
with his ex-primary school teacher

152
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,317
is healthy,
even if you think yours is.

153
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,237
You wanted me to talk to him.

154
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:35,277
Emily has made that possible
for the first time in years.

155
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:38,997
Ah...

156
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:41,237
Haven't you been married enough,
for God's sake?

157
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,997
It starts in the cloisters at St
Frideswide's,

158
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:49,957
straight down to the river,

159
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:52,237
then it's a steep climb up to the
Ridgeway,

160
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,597
but after that, open country
all the way to Midsomer Sanctae.

161
00:17:56,597 --> 00:18:00,517
That's miles and miles.
I don't have to do it all.

162
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:05,917
I'll start with Cully and then when
I've had enough, I'll just stop.

163
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:10,237
There is one little flaw in this plan
of yours, Mrs Barnaby.

164
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:13,437
You do not have a bike.

165
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,957
Mm...

166
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:21,077
I don't enjoy asking you about this,
Dad,

167
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:25,677
but since George Jeffers doesn't seem
to communicate with anyone
at St Frideswide's these days,

168
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:29,237
I'm forced to try other means.
Bicycles, son.

169
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:32,837
What do you mean, 'bicycles'? All I
ever talk to him about is bicycles.

170
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:35,637
Anything else he does is beyond me.
It's beyond most people.

171
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:38,757
And more to the point,
it's not my business.

172
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:42,637
It's not your business he's putting
the future of the college at risk?

173
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,797
Cos that's what it amounts to.

174
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:48,837
It's not been easy persuading Soft
Earth Systems to put up millions.

175
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,437
Is George happy to lose it?

176
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:54,277
I need to know if he's going
to take it that far.

177
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,917
He must talk to you about
the college, Dad.

178
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,197
You knew him when he was
an undergraduate

179
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:01,157
and you were the head porter.

180
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,997
Surely you care, Dad?
Bicycles, son.

181
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,117
I won't let him do it.

182
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:09,877
It's not just about money.
It's about MY future.

183
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:13,557
Jonathan, you are big enough and old
enough.

184
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:16,077
It'll all come right.
You worry too much.

185
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:18,997
Ha-ha! Emily!

186
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,237
Well, what do you think?

187
00:19:58,237 --> 00:20:00,157
About what?

188
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,997
As a collector of vintage sports
cars,

189
00:20:02,997 --> 00:20:05,797
you can appreciate a beautiful
machine.

190
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:08,877
Brilliant engineering.

191
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:11,637
The ultimate space-frame bicycle.

192
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,717
Whatever turns you on, George.
Whatever turns you on.

193
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:17,877
But what about this?
Not so pretty, huh?

194
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:20,997
I'm not sure I ever found you very
pretty.

195
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:23,517
There are those who do.

196
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:27,597
Yeah, we've had our disagreements
lately. The Glitch.

197
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:30,597
I didn't think you'd pull out of
the press conference.

198
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:33,677
All right, announce a delay. Let
your people know we have a problem,

199
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:36,437
tell them I'll redesign the logic
system.

200
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:39,477
It's been ten years and tens of
millions.

201
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:40,957
I can't ditch it

202
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:44,077
because you think a theoretical
glitch in theoretical circumstances

203
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,437
might cause theoretical problems!

204
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,877
Your glitch has never glitched!

205
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:52,797
I'm surrounded by scientists
who tell me it does not exist.

206
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:54,397
No, you're surrounded by idiots

207
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:56,997
you've PAID to tell
you it doesn't exist.

208
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,757
They're all corrupt, of course.

209
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:02,437
All that matters is, I'm right.

210
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,117
The air traffic control system
you're loosing on the world

211
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:08,517
is catastrophically flawed.

212
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,837
I can't undiscover the Glitch,
Clinton.

213
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:16,597
You have blind faith a solution will
be found before people die. I don't.

214
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:21,197
So now I'm going public.

215
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:27,037
I will not let you do it,
whatever it takes.

216
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,077
We've got a meeting, George.
You haven't forgotten, have you?

217
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:33,037
Hey, come on!

218
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:35,477
Respect the bike!

219
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,077
Don't get a puncture.

220
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:47,957
Oh, good grief.

221
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,917
You can't ride this!

222
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:56,757
It's got no chain.
Well, you'll have to get one.

223
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:59,597
You're good at that sort of thing.

224
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:03,157
You only pretend not to be
so I never ask. Joyce...

225
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,917
Right, any more business?

226
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,837
Yes, Midsomer Children's Hospital
T-shirts at a fiver each.

227
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:11,517
We've got to get 500,

228
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:14,517
and assuming that everybody who takes
part in the ride buys one,

229
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:18,877
together with the sponsorship money
and the spectators give on the day,

230
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:21,877
we're hoping for close to
10,000 quid.

231
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:23,797
That's wonderful.
Less if it rains.

232
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:26,597
Where's your optimism, Dan?

233
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,997
The less optimistic I am,
the less disappointed I get.

234
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:33,317
Well, I will be very disappointed
if we don't get to the pub on time.

235
00:22:35,997 --> 00:22:38,157
Are you going to come and join us?
I may, I may.

236
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,397
See you later.
OK.

237
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:51,117
Melanie was here earlier. Tom.

238
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:53,317
Revision?

239
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:56,237
She thinks if I shout loud enough,
he'll buckle down and work.

240
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:58,717
In my view, he'd do the opposite.

241
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:03,557
Oh, you mean he's his father's son?
Oh, not much of a father.

242
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:04,117
Oh, you mean he's his father's son?
Oh, not much of a father.

243
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:07,677
With your help I-I've been trying,
but...

244
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:11,237
It's not just about Tom, is it?
What do you mean?

245
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:14,957
Erm, I just know...

246
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:18,717
how she looks at me.

247
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:20,677
Well, that's ridiculous.
We're friends!

248
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:25,277
Even if there WAS more than that...

249
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:29,517
'This is the weather
the cuckoo likes

250
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:32,597
And they sit outside
at the Traveller's Rest

251
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:37,757
And maids come forth
in sprig muslin dressed

252
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:40,877
And citizens dream of
the south and west

253
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:42,757
And so do I.'

254
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:51,077
Never a good day for it, but on a day
like this, makes it even worse.

255
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:54,997
Who is she?

256
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:58,717
Emily Harte. Primary school teacher
in Aspern Tallow.

257
00:24:58,717 --> 00:25:02,237
Emily Harte... When did it happen?
Bullard thinks last night.

258
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:04,997
Not late.
Have you been into the village yet?

259
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:07,557
No, I came straight here.
They're very angry.

260
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:11,037
The accident that was waiting to
happen. That's what they're saying.

261
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:12,957
George.

262
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:21,437
Oh, she's very young.

263
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,517
All right right for them
to take her back, Tom? No, hang on.

264
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,397
The...cause of death?

265
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:42,917
A lot of broken bones.

266
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,197
She was hit by a vehicle travelling
at speed.

267
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,837
Well,
she must have been very visible.

268
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:54,397
Car went right over her,
no sign of breaking.

269
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:56,317
Drunk-driving is all I can think.

270
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:01,957
All right, you can take her now.

271
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:03,277
Yep. OK.

272
00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:43,037
Uh-oh. Stay here for a bit.

273
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,757
Have you spoken to Emily's mother?

274
00:26:57,757 --> 00:27:00,677
In the kitchen.
She's making some tea.

275
00:27:00,677 --> 00:27:02,677
I erm...

276
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:05,957
I was watching the children...

277
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,077
I'm sorry, sir.

278
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,637
Don't apologise, Gail.
There's no need.

279
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:17,437
Now, come on,
when did the mother last see Emily?

280
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,557
Emily went out yesterday evening

281
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:21,397
to a meeting at the Midsomer
Cycling Club,

282
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:24,277
at a Dr Jeffers' house.

283
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:28,157
What time did it finish?
Well, I spoke to a Mr Canning.

284
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:30,797
He called in to see Emily's mother.
He was at the meeting.

285
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:32,997
He says 8:30.

286
00:27:32,997 --> 00:27:37,397
He rode back from the village with
a Mr Snape, who owns the garage.

287
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:39,517
Emily stayed and talked to
Dr Jeffers.

288
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:41,997
OK.

289
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:47,517
Was she all right?
Yeah, yes she was.

290
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:50,797
You've had a run-in with Dr Jeffers,
haven't you?

291
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:53,757
Yeah, a person who thinks
I should have arrested everybody

292
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,197
with a fast car
at Soft Earth Systems.

293
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,677
Hit-and-run.
What kind of animal could leave...?

294
00:28:01,677 --> 00:28:04,917
Dr Jeffers, we need definite times.

295
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,397
Emily Harte was here about
the Pilgrims' Ride?

296
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,637
Yes.

297
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:12,037
What time did the meeting end?

298
00:28:13,077 --> 00:28:15,757
Er, 8, 8:15.

299
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:19,157
It was dark when she left,

300
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:23,237
that's why she was riding my bicycle.
There were no lights on hers.

301
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,837
You know the trouble we've had,
the near-misses...

302
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,237
Yeah, we are aware of all that, sir.

303
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:31,877
The time you've wasted looking for
a man with a bucket of paint,

304
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,237
when you should have been doing
something to stop these idiots!

305
00:28:35,237 --> 00:28:39,037
A woman is dead! A young woman with
her whole life ahead of her,

306
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:41,637
and the best you can say is,
'We are aware of that'?

307
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:56,877
I'm really sorry about Emily.

308
00:28:56,877 --> 00:29:00,557
Thought YOU'D be pleased.
That's a terrible thing to say!

309
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:02,597
You hated her.
Oh, Tom!

310
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:04,917
Because Dad liked her
and I liked her too.

311
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,037
That was a problem, right?

312
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,037
She could have been his daughter.

313
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:11,837
She was bidding to be your mother.
I should be so lucky!

314
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:19,837
I shouldn't have said that.

315
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:22,637
Don't keep Clinton waiting, Mum.

316
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,637
You don't want to lose another one.

317
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:50,317
Forensics have got samples of the
car's paint from the bicycle.

318
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:53,157
Dark green.
We may even get a make out of it.

319
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:56,037
Good
The bike itself was barely touched,

320
00:29:56,037 --> 00:29:59,237
but there's obviously some slight
damage to the bodywork of the car.

321
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:01,237
Dr Jeffers works at the university.

322
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:03,837
He's some kind of hotshot scientist.

323
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:06,477
Need to know more about him, not just
fact that he likes cycling.

324
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:12,957
She leaves Dr Jeffers' house,

325
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:15,357
she's on Dr Jeffer's bicycle,

326
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,557
it's a dark night.

327
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:20,397
Would YOU have known it wasn't him?
No. No.

328
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:26,637
Why was the damage to the bike
so little, George?

329
00:30:26,637 --> 00:30:29,357
Emily's injuries, well,
they they were terrible,

330
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:30,997
like the wheels had gone right over
her.

331
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:36,597
She could have fallen off the bike
and the car went over her.

332
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:42,037
But then you say the car reversed?
To see what damage was done?

333
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:44,517
No, no, George.

334
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,717
I don't believe the driver ever got
out of the car.

335
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:49,637
I think he, or she, reversed,

336
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:51,277
like you said,

337
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:53,557
and then drove over Emily
deliberately.

338
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:58,277
No accident. We're looking at
first-degree murder here.

339
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,537
George isn't interested in money.

340
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:12,457
You say that,
but I never really believed it.

341
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:15,897
No, it's true.
He was so careless about patents,

342
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:18,097
he moved on to Kernal Logic

343
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:21,097
and he just couldn't be bothered to
protect our interests.

344
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:26,377
I can't afford that luxury.
It has cost me a fortune to develop.

345
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:29,017
We'll make a packet when it goes
online, but so will George.

346
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,497
Should have hung in there, Mel.

347
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:37,537
Well, he always was
his own worst enemy.

348
00:31:37,537 --> 00:31:42,137
I'm putting together an army of
bigger and better scientists.

349
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:45,977
I'm gonna tell the world that
he's entered the Twilight Zone.

350
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:48,897
I'm gonna destroy him
before he destroys me.

351
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:58,777
Cully loved this so much.
We should keep it.

352
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:01,377
It's still in decent nick
and you never know...

353
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,417
Never know what, love?
You know.

354
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:07,537
Cully's not going to give you a
reason to use that any time soon.

355
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:10,457
Is she?
Mm... Oooh! Right!

356
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:15,697
Oh, yes. What a genius!

357
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:17,097
I've done a good job on this!

358
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,417
Tom?
What?

359
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,217
No, no! Stop!
Why?

360
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:39,217
I'd love you to stay, but I've got
enough problems with Tom.

361
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:42,257
Oh, no, he's a big boy now.

362
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:44,817
I know, but he's just taking it
really badly.

363
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:54,057
Oh, no. Look, I promise I'll sort
something out, OK?

364
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:22,737
Are you OK?

365
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:25,497
It's better to do it on the sofa
than in the car.

366
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:27,457
I don't know what the neighbours
think.

367
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:30,057
Don't you dare speak to me like
that!

368
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,497
Where are you going?
I don't know.

369
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:36,657
But at least I'm not going round for
a heart-to-heart with Emily.

370
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:40,537
Tom!

371
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:43,177
You're here late?

372
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:46,657
You asked me to contact a dozen
scientists. Four are in California.

373
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:51,257
So I thought it was worth waiting
for them to get out of bed

374
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,137
before asking them to do YOU
a favour.

375
00:34:54,297 --> 00:34:57,697
Are they going to write for us? Mm,
except Steve Wright from Stanford.

376
00:34:57,697 --> 00:34:59,497
What's his problem?
His problem is,

377
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,857
he actually thinks George has got
a point.

378
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:03,777
Ah, he's a second-division clown.

379
00:35:08,057 --> 00:35:11,577
Do you wanna have a drink?
No, not tonight.

380
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,817
I don't know what division
I'M playing in,

381
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:17,017
but I will not be played as
a substitute.

382
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:48,337
Morning!

383
00:35:57,777 --> 00:35:59,857
Well done, sarge.

384
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,937
The training's obviously paying off.

385
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:04,657
Sorry, can you spell that
for me, please?

386
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:11,857
I've been talking to some of the
students at the university.

387
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:14,377
Jeffers made his name in the '80s

388
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:16,777
with an invention called Wafer
Logic.

389
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:21,257
The circuit boards that drive
computers

390
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:23,697
are printed on wafer-thin
slices of silicon.

391
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:29,617
The wafer is then cut into a hundred
separate chips

392
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:32,417
and the necessary connections
are made between them.

393
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:37,737
Jeffers' Wafer Logic said,
let's not cut the wafer,

394
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,857
let's build connections between
the chips inside the wafer.

395
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,777
Is there more?

396
00:36:43,777 --> 00:36:47,697
Ten years ago,
he came up with Kernel Logic.

397
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:51,177
This time he said,
let's not slice the silicon,

398
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:55,497
let's build a million computers
inside a whole block of the stuff.

399
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,537
A million computers?

400
00:36:57,537 --> 00:36:59,297
Yeah. It takes that kind of power

401
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:02,937
to model the air space
of the entire planet.

402
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:05,777
If it works, it'll make a fortune
for Soft Earth Systems

403
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,577
AND a tidy sum for Jeffers.

404
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:11,937
And if it doesn't, the investors
will lose...billions.

405
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:14,817
Well, thank you for that, Jones.
Very good. Very good indeed.

406
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:33,977
Ah, you had the chain too tight.
Much too tight.

407
00:37:33,977 --> 00:37:36,697
Fine machine, though.
Don't make them like this any more.

408
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:39,017
I never know if that's a good or bad
thing.

409
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:41,217
That's not going to work,
is it...?

410
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:48,457
Know who did it yet? That's what
we're here to find out, Mr Snape.

411
00:37:48,457 --> 00:37:51,697
Identify the car and you can find
the driver, right?

412
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:56,137
You got something I can go on?
It's one of them.

413
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:59,217
Look at their cars and you'll find
the driver quick enough.

414
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:19,337
We deal with the press conference
as best we can.

415
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:21,417
If Jeffers doesn't show,
no big deal.

416
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:24,937
It's educational press.
Hardly investigative journalism.

417
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:27,737
The more I think about it, we're
better off without him.

418
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:30,977
And if we're rubbishing his ideas
anyway...

419
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,777
You know what's at stake here?

420
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:37,577
If George goes public, my company
loses billions and I lose my job,

421
00:38:37,577 --> 00:38:39,977
your university doesn't get a science
building

422
00:38:39,977 --> 00:38:43,617
and YOU don't become Master
when he retires.

423
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:45,937
So, I want reassurance.

424
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,217
When this gets ugly, and it will,

425
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:50,617
I don't want this university
defending George

426
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:54,177
out of some misguided notion of
academic freedom.

427
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:57,537
When I say he's crazy, he is.

428
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:20,097
I've um pranged my car, Mr Snape.

429
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:23,377
How did you do that, then?
Will it affect the cost?

430
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:26,977
Have you been trying to paint it?
How quickly can you do this?

431
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:29,217
That is, of course,
if you want the job.

432
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,857
I could always take it
up to Causton.

433
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:37,497
Have fun.

434
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:46,817
We know that Emily Harte was killed
between 10:30 and 11:30,

435
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,537
but if we take the time
she left Jeffers' house...

436
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:57,017
If someone wanted to kill Jeffers,

437
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:59,977
what are the chances of just coming
across him cycling at night?

438
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:03,177
Very slim. Must have been unplanned.

439
00:40:03,177 --> 00:40:06,417
Look, it was already dark.

440
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,897
At some point outside the gate
or along the road,

441
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:13,217
our killer sees the bike and sees
someone he THINKS is Jeffers.

442
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:17,097
It's the right place, right clothes,
right bike.

443
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:19,377
Maybe someone thought
he was the Bucketman?

444
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:22,097
Um, couldn't help but overhear...

445
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:24,977
Now, for an intelligent man,

446
00:40:24,977 --> 00:40:27,777
George was always stupid
when it came to judging people.

447
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:31,257
He doesn't believe what you're
saying. I do.

448
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:32,737
And what am I saying, sir?

449
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:35,097
Somebody tried to kill him.

450
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:37,217
I know exactly who.

451
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:42,417
'Deus auribus.' 'We have heard with
our ears.' Clinton Finn!

452
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,777
Clinton Finn?

453
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:47,417
The man you say was responsible
for damaging your tandem?

454
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:52,817
I'm at the university too, with
Jeffers. Organist and choirmaster.

455
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,497
I'm one of the few Fellows who
objects to selling ourselves
to Soft Earth Systems.

456
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:59,537
'Eripe me de inimicis.'
'Deliver me from mine enemies!'

457
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:05,617
The university's enthralled of him
with his swanky new science building,
from IBM Master down,

458
00:41:05,617 --> 00:41:08,617
all terrified Jeffers is going to
lose us the dosh.

459
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:10,577
And the break-in the day before.

460
00:41:10,577 --> 00:41:13,817
A burglar's in the house and Jeffers
says, 'He's not a very good one.'

461
00:41:13,817 --> 00:41:16,257
There's no point in bothering the
police'! Fool!

462
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,737
Mr Finn's at the university
at a press conference.

463
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:23,857
He'll be back this afternoon.

464
00:41:26,337 --> 00:41:30,177
We've got to talk to anyone who might
have seen Emily Harte
on the night she died.

465
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,097
Did you see her?
No, I didn't.

466
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:34,817
She wasn't someone I knew or had
even spoken to.

467
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:37,297
Well, were you out and about
that night?

468
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:40,537
We've got to find someone help
identify the car that killed her.

469
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:42,377
I was working here until ten.

470
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:45,257
So you drove home, then?

471
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:47,377
No, I didn't.

472
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:51,137
I was working here late with
Clinton. We had a drink. I stayed.

473
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:52,577
And yes, before you ask,

474
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,617
'stayed' does mean
what it might infer.

475
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:59,937
Look, maybe it wasn't an accident,
Mr Barnaby,

476
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:04,737
but maybe George Jeffers wasn't the
intended target after all.

477
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,737
And why do you say that?

478
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:11,377
Well, I know she was everyone's idea
of a little angel,

479
00:42:11,377 --> 00:42:13,897
but it would be a mistake to imagine
there wasn't anyone

480
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:15,937
who'd want to harm Emily Harte.

481
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:20,097
I thought you didn't know her?

482
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:24,777
I didn't, but I do know Melanie
Jeffers,

483
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:27,377
who first lost a valuable husband,

484
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:30,657
then felt she was losing her son,

485
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:32,537
both to the same woman.

486
00:42:35,977 --> 00:42:38,297
Not the nicest woman in the world.

487
00:42:38,297 --> 00:42:40,857
Doesn't mean she's not observant.

488
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:44,897
Go and see the ex-Mrs Jeffers,
Jones, see what you make of her.

489
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:47,497
I'll try and find out why our Dr
Jeffers seems so...

490
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:50,897
relaxed about his burglary.

491
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:58,897
I can't see how an inept burglar is
more significant now than yesterday.

492
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:01,377
Nothing was taken.

493
00:43:01,377 --> 00:43:05,497
Someone broke in here, Dr Jeffers.
Why didn't you call the police?

494
00:43:05,497 --> 00:43:08,337
I don't believe anybody's trying to
kill me.

495
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:12,537
Besides, I'm taking my own
precautions.

496
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:15,537
There a webcam.

497
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:18,377
So now, if I'm not here,

498
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:24,737
I can see what's happening
via the internet.

499
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:28,897
Dr Jeffers, I still don't really
know what happened to Emily,

500
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:33,177
but I have to consider whether she
really was the intended victim.

501
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,217
It was a hit-and-run.

502
00:43:35,217 --> 00:43:37,617
And on that road
it will have been a local car.

503
00:43:41,057 --> 00:43:44,057
You've had some disagreement,
haven't you,

504
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:47,417
with Mr Clinton Finn of Soft Earth
Systems.

505
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,297
About science, not murder.

506
00:43:51,817 --> 00:43:54,937
Isn't there an adage in your line of
work

507
00:43:54,937 --> 00:43:57,657
that there comes a time in the
development of any project

508
00:43:57,657 --> 00:44:01,017
when the marketing manager has to
shoot the designer?

509
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:04,017
I do hope that's not literally true,

510
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:06,377
but I'm guessing that your
disagreement

511
00:44:07,057 --> 00:44:09,097
might cost millions
if not billions of pounds?

512
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:13,937
Oh, come on, Dr Jeffers, indulge me,

513
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:17,337
in terms an ignorant layman
might understand. OK.

514
00:44:20,097 --> 00:44:25,257
The binary system deals with any
question

515
00:44:25,257 --> 00:44:27,737
by giving the answer 'yes' or 'no'.

516
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:30,657
Understood?
So far, so good.

517
00:44:30,657 --> 00:44:33,097
We call it a logic system.

518
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:35,137
But I can now prove

519
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:41,577
that when any binary system receives
two almost, but not quite, identical
bits of information

520
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:44,697
at almost but not quite the same
time,

521
00:44:44,697 --> 00:44:48,497
it can theoretically fibrillate,

522
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:50,817
or not make up its mind.

523
00:44:50,817 --> 00:44:54,257
Instead of 'yes' or 'no',

524
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:56,697
it says, 'I don't know.'

525
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:59,297
Logic flies out of the window,

526
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,337
systems can behave in totally
unpredictable ways.

527
00:45:02,337 --> 00:45:03,697
They can crash?

528
00:45:03,697 --> 00:45:07,257
Not a word anyone wants to hear in
relation to air traffic control.

529
00:45:09,337 --> 00:45:14,377
I can't keep silent. I believe a huge
air traffic control system,

530
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:18,777
based on my invention, Kernel Logic,
is susceptible to the Glitch.

531
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:21,217
And that would mean what?

532
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:26,617
If they take me seriously, it will
cost them millions of dollars.

533
00:45:26,617 --> 00:45:30,977
If they ignore me, people will die.

534
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:42,017
I'm surprised at you, Dan.
What do you mean?

535
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:46,297
Looking after their cars,
even after what's happened.

536
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:48,937
Are you going to call the police?
What do YOU think?

537
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:56,297
Well, I'm forever arguing with
George. It's what we do.

538
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:58,657
Not that it gets me far,

539
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:01,617
but I have to provide a home
and a future for Tom,

540
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:04,497
who also happens to be George's son
too,

541
00:46:04,497 --> 00:46:06,697
though a lot of the time
you wouldn't notice it.

542
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:11,377
He doesn't acknowledge Tom?
Well, when he remembers.

543
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:15,337
Most of the time, I don't think he
cares whether he sees Tom or not.

544
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:17,897
You don't want to believe everything
she says.

545
00:46:17,897 --> 00:46:21,137
I don't like saying my mother's
a liar... Tom!

546
00:46:21,137 --> 00:46:24,537
..but where Dad's involved, you want
to be careful. Just shut up!

547
00:46:26,377 --> 00:46:29,617
I'm sorry you heard that. He does
care whether he sees me, Mum.

548
00:46:29,617 --> 00:46:32,017
He likes me. And I like him.

549
00:46:32,017 --> 00:46:34,137
And you do hate that, don't you, Mum?

550
00:46:34,137 --> 00:46:36,657
Just like you hate anyone he cares
about.

551
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:38,537
Just like you hated Emily Harte.

552
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:42,497
Get out! Just get out of here!

553
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:44,417
Go!

554
00:46:59,857 --> 00:47:01,577
Tom!

555
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:12,097
I'm sorry.

556
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,577
He's right. I did hate her.

557
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:21,017
I felt she was taking them both away
from me. Not just George, Tom too.

558
00:47:21,017 --> 00:47:24,457
Huh. What must they think of me now?

559
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:28,617
Oh, God!

560
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:34,337
I've said some stupid things,
Mr Barnaby.

561
00:47:34,337 --> 00:47:36,617
I wish I hadn't.

562
00:47:36,617 --> 00:47:39,337
Most of all, I wish I hadn't said
them to my son.

563
00:47:39,337 --> 00:47:41,337
But whatever I felt about Emily
Harte -

564
00:47:41,337 --> 00:47:44,337
Mrs Jeffers, we're not here to judge
you,

565
00:47:44,337 --> 00:47:47,297
we're here to find out what happened.

566
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:52,337
I resented her, that's all.

567
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:55,617
She was younger, prettier.

568
00:47:55,617 --> 00:48:00,097
And the only two people in the world
I really care about adored her.

569
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:02,137
And that hurt me more than anything.

570
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:09,777
Jeffers has been married three times
and Melanie was his third.

571
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:11,537
They were married nine years.

572
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:16,857
But people are saying that Melanie's
in a relationship
that he's not happy about.

573
00:48:16,857 --> 00:48:20,097
And who is the unwelcome suitor?
Clinton Finn.

574
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,457
So Emily Harte had at least one
enemy.

575
00:48:23,457 --> 00:48:26,097
That makes Melanie Jeffers
a suspect.

576
00:48:26,097 --> 00:48:29,977
Who did she intend to kill?
Emily Harte or George Jeffers?

577
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:40,343
It's coming along, but er, it's
a celebration. Do remember that.

578
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:42,223
Joy is what I want
for the Pilgrims' Ride.

579
00:49:42,223 --> 00:49:45,423
'Omnes gente plaudite!'

580
00:49:45,423 --> 00:49:48,343
'O sing to the Lord
with the voice of melody!'

581
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:49,863
That's it. See you later.

582
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:58,183
Well done, everybody

583
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,823
Whadda you think?

584
00:50:09,663 --> 00:50:12,503
A triumph, of course, Norman.

585
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:15,743
I'm sorry, you're not in the mood.
Not much in the mood myself.

586
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,063
I still can't believe she's dead.

587
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:22,663
I think there are several things
you can't believe...

588
00:50:22,663 --> 00:50:25,863
and really should.
I've told Chief Inspector Barnaby.

589
00:50:25,863 --> 00:50:27,783
The man's no fool. He can see it.

590
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:30,343
It seems you won't see it at all.

591
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,743
If someone really was trying to kill
me, don't you see,

592
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,303
I'm responsible for Emily's death!

593
00:50:42,223 --> 00:50:44,303
How do I live with that?

594
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:47,903
Not by pretending it didn't happen.

595
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:55,583
So, this wonderful building

596
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:59,943
will not only bring the finest minds
to our university

597
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:01,943
from across the globe,

598
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:05,543
it will also bring benefits
outside our walls.

599
00:51:05,543 --> 00:51:09,343
New industries. New jobs.

600
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:14,223
Wherever there is excellence

601
00:51:14,223 --> 00:51:18,303
is where the technology of the
21st century will base itself.

602
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,743
So I think we could take questions
now? Yeah, why not.

603
00:51:25,063 --> 00:51:26,463
Yes, madam?

604
00:51:26,463 --> 00:51:29,423
Does anyone really give all that
money for nothing, Mr Finn?

605
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:32,863
Yes, er, someone does. We do.

606
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:40,263
The money for this project is coming
from Soft Earth's new air traffic
control system,

607
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:45,223
which is based on the Kernel Logic
technology invented by Dr Jeffers?

608
00:51:45,223 --> 00:51:49,543
A good example of new technology
emerging from theoretical science.

609
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:55,023
So why isn't Dr Jeffers here
to tell us all about it today?

610
00:51:55,023 --> 00:51:58,463
Well, if you've read any of George's
work,

611
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:01,383
you'll know that
he's left mainstream science.

612
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:05,143
Where his ideas are taking him,
no-one really knows,

613
00:52:05,143 --> 00:52:08,543
but it's a long way from
air traffic control systems.

614
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,543
But...

615
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:15,823
Yes, well, I think it's time for us
all to have a closer look

616
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:19,223
at this extraordinary building.
Yes, please. Gather round.

617
00:52:21,663 --> 00:52:24,063
Thank you very much. Erm...

618
00:52:28,743 --> 00:52:31,583
Doesn't look like a Bucketman job,
does it?

619
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:33,383
YOU'RE the expert, then!
And you.

620
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:37,423
Paint but no glue, see?

621
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:40,543
Yep.

622
00:52:40,543 --> 00:52:43,503
Is that the colour of the car
that killed Emily?

623
00:52:43,503 --> 00:52:45,743
Yeah.

624
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:52,023
Any ideas?
I could give it some thought.

625
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:54,903
There's not many cars round here
I don't know.

626
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:58,103
No, keep the card.

627
00:52:58,103 --> 00:53:00,503
Let me know if you come up with
anything.

628
00:53:09,383 --> 00:53:11,463
How do you feel about this project?

629
00:53:11,463 --> 00:53:13,503
I'm excited by the intellectual
stimulus

630
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:16,943
a department of theoretical science
can bring to this university.

631
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:22,383
We'll make this the Liverpool or
Manchester United
of scientific experimentation.

632
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:24,863
Of course, you can't do that without
money.

633
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:29,303
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby?
Ursula Carroll, Causton Advertiser.

634
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:31,623
Ah, yes.
We've met before, haven't we?

635
00:53:31,623 --> 00:53:35,143
You're investigating the fatal
hit-and-run in Aspern Tallow,
I believe?

636
00:53:35,143 --> 00:53:38,303
I just wondered why you should turn
up at this press conference?

637
00:53:38,303 --> 00:53:41,583
I need to talk to a lot of people
and I find them where they are.

638
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:44,423
Is Mr Finn one of those people?

639
00:53:44,423 --> 00:53:46,983
Look, whoever was in or around
Aspern Tallow

640
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:48,743
on the night Emily Harte was killed

641
00:53:48,743 --> 00:53:50,743
is one of those people.

642
00:53:50,743 --> 00:53:54,223
And there are a lot of people.

643
00:53:54,223 --> 00:53:56,903
Waiting to talk to me, I guess!
Yes, indeed I am, sir.

644
00:53:57,663 --> 00:54:00,223
About speeding, the Bucketman

645
00:54:00,223 --> 00:54:02,303
or the Centre for Theoretical
Science?

646
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:04,543
No, it's about the death of
Emily Harte, sir.

647
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:09,183
Not making any connection there.

648
00:54:09,183 --> 00:54:11,823
Excuse me, but if you'd like to use
my room, Clinton?

649
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,623
It's this way.
Thank you.

650
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:24,263
George has his Glitch catastrophe
theory.

651
00:54:24,263 --> 00:54:28,183
Like any conspiracy theory,
no objective truth is needed.

652
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:31,543
Any disagreement proves the
conspiracy to keep it from the
public.

653
00:54:33,743 --> 00:54:37,583
Are you embarrassed at all about
Jeffers not being at your press
conference?

654
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:42,983
Well, I wish he hadn't abandoned
serious technology to boo and hiss,

655
00:54:42,983 --> 00:54:46,703
but who should be more embarrassed,
him or me?

656
00:54:48,423 --> 00:54:52,223
I believe that Emily Harte was the
unintended victim

657
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:55,223
of an attempt on Dr Jeffers' life.

658
00:54:55,223 --> 00:54:57,663
And he has enemies, as you will know,
sir.

659
00:54:57,663 --> 00:55:01,503
George is trying to wreck something
we worked on together.

660
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:03,943
Am I hacked off? You bet.

661
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:06,503
Am I out there to kill him? No.

662
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:12,423
You tell me where you were on the
night Emily Harte was killed, please.

663
00:55:13,863 --> 00:55:16,463
I'll need discretion here.
There's a woman involved.

664
00:55:18,543 --> 00:55:22,503
And she is?
My product manager, Helen Markham.

665
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:25,463
Not Mrs Jeffers?

666
00:55:27,943 --> 00:55:30,983
Do you deal in the facts
or just the fancy footwork?

667
00:55:30,983 --> 00:55:35,143
Look, I really didn't feel like I
needed to waste my time

668
00:55:35,143 --> 00:55:38,703
reporting another Bucketman incident.
You've done nothing in the past

669
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,943
and you're not going to do more
in the middle of a murder
investigation.

670
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:45,823
Someone threw a bucket of paint over
your car, they ran off

671
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:47,903
and you just shrugged and drove
home?

672
00:55:47,903 --> 00:55:50,703
Well, it did cause me to crash into
a gate post.

673
00:55:50,703 --> 00:55:54,863
But yes, I cleaned the windscreen as
best I could and I drove on.

674
00:55:54,863 --> 00:55:57,423
You didn't tell Mr Snape that
when you took the car in.

675
00:55:57,423 --> 00:55:59,583
Because I went to get my car
repaired.

676
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:02,983
I didn't want a gathering of village
idiots to dance around it and cheer.

677
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:07,263
And you didn't think to report it?
No, because I've done nothing wrong.

678
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:11,303
Listen, I'm sorry about Emily Harte's
death, truly I am,

679
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:13,343
but I had nothing whatsoever to do
with it.

680
00:56:15,423 --> 00:56:18,903
You've had arguments yourself with
Dr Jeffers, haven't you? Yes.

681
00:56:19,503 --> 00:56:21,863
Heated arguments.

682
00:56:21,863 --> 00:56:24,223
If you're going to jump to the
conclusion

683
00:56:24,223 --> 00:56:27,703
that everyone who's had an argument
with George Jeffers is a murderer,

684
00:56:27,703 --> 00:56:32,823
you're in for a very long haul.
Answers, please, sir, not opinions.

685
00:56:35,063 --> 00:56:37,623
I was here, working.

686
00:56:37,623 --> 00:56:40,023
It was late by the time I finished.
I slept here.

687
00:56:40,023 --> 00:56:46,023
Anyone confirm that? Well, I ate in
the senior common room.

688
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:49,903
The college servants will tell you
that I came back here at about nine.

689
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:51,983
I saw no-one else.

690
00:56:51,983 --> 00:56:54,143
And no-one saw you?

691
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:56,623
I'm afraid not.

692
00:56:58,703 --> 00:57:01,943
We need money.
A great deal of money.

693
00:57:01,943 --> 00:57:06,663
It's tedious, but we don't need to
sell our souls or to kill for it.

694
00:57:06,663 --> 00:57:10,103
I hope we're a little more
sophisticated than that.

695
00:57:10,103 --> 00:57:12,063
Well, somebody isn't, sir.

696
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:16,503
Perhaps you should look at George's
personal life.

697
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:21,783
There's been a string of disgruntled
wives and mistresses.

698
00:57:21,783 --> 00:57:24,983
And I've always thought those are
just the ones we know about.

699
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,903
'Cum invocarem!
'Hear me when I call!'

700
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:33,143
Well, I'll bear that in mind, sir.

701
00:57:33,143 --> 00:57:35,023
Thank you, Doctor.

702
00:57:49,543 --> 00:57:51,183
Hey!

703
00:57:51,183 --> 00:57:55,503
I'm cooking risotto, your favourite.

704
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,543
I'm going out.

705
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:03,863
Tom, I can't undo what I've said.
I'm sorry.

706
00:58:05,303 --> 00:58:09,543
Can we start again? You know I'm not
such an awful person.

707
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:11,703
I've got...things to do, Mum.

708
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:25,263
Mr Snape.
Your wife will do well on that.

709
00:58:25,263 --> 00:58:29,583
They've all got fancy bikes now.
All paint and no pedals, most of 'em.

710
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,263
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

711
00:58:31,263 --> 00:58:34,263
I could have picked it up myself.
I had to be in Causton.

712
00:58:34,263 --> 00:58:36,463
And I'm hoping you've something
better to do.

713
00:58:36,463 --> 00:58:41,383
Oh yes. Yes, we have. I'm drawing up
a list of green cars for Sgt Jones.

714
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:44,343
Oh, that's much appreciated
As long as he told you.

715
00:58:44,343 --> 00:58:47,463
Some people have doubts as to which
side he's on

716
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:49,863
when it comes to the Soft Earth mob.

717
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:53,183
Well, I'd be happy to set them
straight.

718
00:58:53,183 --> 00:58:55,103
Now, Mr Snape, how much do I owe
you?

719
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,903
Don't matter. Wasn't a big job.

720
00:58:56,903 --> 00:59:00,543
You've got to take something. All
kinds of accusations come our way.

721
00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:02,183
Here you are. 20 quid, that's yours.

722
00:59:02,183 --> 00:59:04,143
OK. And thank you.

723
00:59:07,063 --> 00:59:09,423
Joycey!
Ooh!

724
00:59:16,223 --> 00:59:18,423
A university cannot be fettered

725
00:59:18,423 --> 00:59:22,823
by the financial consequences of
telling the truth. Never.

726
00:59:22,823 --> 00:59:26,223
Your argument with Clinton Finn
is that there's a risk involved

727
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:29,103
in the air traffic control system
he's developing. Mm-hm.

728
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:32,663
He thinks you're wrong,
but no-one's trying to stop you
saying what you think.

729
00:59:32,663 --> 00:59:36,143
My dear, everyone's trying to stop
me.

730
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:39,743
If I wasn't a Fellow at St
Frideswide's and thus unsackable,

731
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,223
do you really think
they'd let me through the gates?

732
00:59:42,223 --> 00:59:45,743
Isn't that just a bit paranoid?
He's always been paranoid.

733
00:59:45,743 --> 00:59:49,383
Be careful printing anything George
says, unless it's about bikes!

734
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:51,223
I'm giving an interview here!

735
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:53,863
It's your round,
so we'll shut up if you pay up.

736
00:59:53,863 --> 00:59:55,743
Put it on the slate, then!

737
00:59:59,703 --> 01:00:02,623
Now, let me show you
what I've been doing.

738
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:11,063
I've got webcams inside and outside
the house.

739
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:16,903
What's that light?

740
01:00:20,143 --> 01:00:22,503
Something's moving.
There's someone in there!

741
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:25,063
This is better than the telly!
You are being burgled.

742
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:26,943
You'd better call the police.

743
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:28,783
I'm looking at him and
he doesn't even know it!

744
01:00:30,983 --> 01:00:33,383
No! No!

745
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:35,103
No, I'm not having that!

746
01:01:25,063 --> 01:01:26,983
Come on, where are you?

747
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:31,823
I've already seen you!

748
01:02:13,248 --> 01:02:17,848
No, no, no.
You can't report any of this.

749
01:02:17,848 --> 01:02:20,008
The crime news needn't be a big
deal.

750
01:02:20,008 --> 01:02:23,008
I know you don't like too much
plastered in the local rag.

751
01:02:23,008 --> 01:02:25,608
But?
Well, if I'm honest,

752
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:28,368
I've got a sniff of something
for a national. Have you?

753
01:02:28,368 --> 01:02:30,408
Big business and science?

754
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:33,368
So you're seeing this as a career
opportunity, are you?

755
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:37,408
Well, when the crime's all solved,
you'll have loads of useful
information for me.

756
01:02:37,408 --> 01:02:39,808
All right, all right, Miss Carroll.
Maybe.

757
01:02:39,808 --> 01:02:42,448
But as of now you are a witness.

758
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:44,528
And you do know what that means,
don't you? Yes.

759
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:47,688
Yes. So goodbye, Miss Carroll.

760
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:01,728
Dr Jeffers not here?
He's at the college.

761
01:03:01,728 --> 01:03:04,128
Have you got his camera stuff?

762
01:03:04,128 --> 01:03:07,808
Dark figure in a dark room...
wearing a ski mask.

763
01:03:10,008 --> 01:03:14,888
Jeffers turns the hall light on,
but the burglar's not identifiable.

764
01:03:14,888 --> 01:03:16,528
Let's see...

765
01:03:16,528 --> 01:03:20,848
Looks like the Bucketman, which
doesn't make any sense.

766
01:03:20,848 --> 01:03:24,328
But there was a Bucketman attack,
wasn't there, the previous night?

767
01:03:24,328 --> 01:03:27,888
On Helen Markham.
Paint but no glue.

768
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:30,408
Might be a copycat.
That's all we need.

769
01:03:30,408 --> 01:03:32,768
And the car was clear?
Yeah.

770
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:36,608
But...we do have a result on what
we got from Jeffers' bike.

771
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:38,088
Oh, excellent.

772
01:03:38,088 --> 01:03:42,688
And I've got a list of possible cars
in the area from Dan Snape.

773
01:03:42,688 --> 01:03:45,168
Any match? From the year of
manufacture,

774
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:48,008
could be a C-type Jaguar.

775
01:03:48,008 --> 01:03:50,168
Clinton Finn's got one in his
collection.

776
01:03:55,408 --> 01:03:58,928
Any news on George yet?
It was just a knock to the head.

777
01:03:58,928 --> 01:04:00,728
I spoke to Jonathan Canning just now

778
01:04:00,728 --> 01:04:03,488
and George was in the senior common
room for breakfast...

779
01:04:03,488 --> 01:04:04,768
still arguing.

780
01:04:04,768 --> 01:04:07,448
That's good. That's good.

781
01:04:07,448 --> 01:04:10,408
Oh, by the way, Helen,

782
01:04:10,408 --> 01:04:15,808
I hope it's all right that I spent
yesterday evening with YOU...
till late.

783
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:21,048
I don't have a problem with that,
Clinton.

784
01:04:21,048 --> 01:04:23,728
But you do know everything comes
with a price.

785
01:04:23,728 --> 01:04:24,968
And that is?

786
01:04:24,968 --> 01:04:28,568
Maybe you should decide who you're
screwing, me or Melanie Jeffers.

787
01:04:29,808 --> 01:04:32,248
Because both of us really isn't
on the menu any more.

788
01:04:40,128 --> 01:04:45,928
In binary systems, the Glitch is
a moment of indecision.

789
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:51,328
But how can indecision have anything
to do with the creation of life?

790
01:04:51,328 --> 01:04:54,248
We know life exists,

791
01:04:54,248 --> 01:04:57,328
though as I look around this theatre,
I wonder...

792
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:03,608
But life exists. Evolution exists.

793
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:09,848
Yet classic Darwinism, infinitely
slow alteration over millennia,

794
01:05:09,848 --> 01:05:12,328
had to start somewhere.

795
01:05:12,328 --> 01:05:15,008
At a time when there was no life,

796
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:16,888
did a binary action waver?

797
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:24,008
Did life itself emerge
from a moment of indecision?

798
01:05:24,008 --> 01:05:29,928
Maybe life was created by mistake,

799
01:05:29,928 --> 01:05:32,888
and again, as I look around this
room...

800
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:35,368
I wonder!

801
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:39,568
But let me get you up to date!

802
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:42,608
Why have I got this bump on the head?

803
01:05:42,608 --> 01:05:46,968
It may surprise you to learn that
it's probably because of the Glitch,

804
01:05:46,968 --> 01:05:50,928
that there are people in business
and even at this university

805
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:54,888
who are extremely uncomfortable with
my theories,

806
01:05:54,888 --> 01:05:58,408
particularly when it comes to
aircraft dropping out of the sky

807
01:05:58,408 --> 01:06:00,328
because of it.

808
01:06:00,328 --> 01:06:04,288
There are those who claim that
Jeffers has a Galileo complex!

809
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:25,448
But it isn't the Inquisition
who are trying to keep me quiet...

810
01:06:48,808 --> 01:06:50,808
Telephone call
for Miss Markham.

811
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,808
Miss Markham to the telephone,
please.

812
01:07:09,048 --> 01:07:10,968
Look, but don't touch.

813
01:07:12,888 --> 01:07:16,848
The door was open. I think you mean
the door wasn't locked.

814
01:07:16,848 --> 01:07:19,408
Usual procedure is to wait until
invited in.

815
01:07:19,408 --> 01:07:24,328
Well, I did ask Miss Markham if -
To let me know you were here.

816
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:27,608
Hope you've found
what you're looking for.

817
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:31,688
Has it been repaired or body work
resprayed recently?

818
01:07:31,688 --> 01:07:33,608
Original Le Mans-winning livery.

819
01:07:34,808 --> 01:07:37,608
I need to take a paint sample.
A scratch'll cost you.

820
01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:41,208
I will sue.

821
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:46,728
See what I'm up against!

822
01:07:49,768 --> 01:07:51,968
About last night, sir.

823
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:54,968
I'm very impressed by your webcam
system, but not by your response.

824
01:07:54,968 --> 01:07:57,328
You should have called the police.

825
01:07:57,328 --> 01:08:02,168
Ah, if someone was trying to kill
me, I gave them a good opportunity.

826
01:08:02,168 --> 01:08:05,208
But I'm not dead.
No, thankfully.

827
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:08,608
Who do you think it was? Think it was
the same person as last time?

828
01:08:08,608 --> 01:08:12,488
Tell me, who do you think it was?

829
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,488
I had an idea. I was wrong.
So there's nothing to tell.

830
01:08:15,488 --> 01:08:20,928
I am very confident that it wasn't
Tom bashed you over the head last
night,

831
01:08:20,928 --> 01:08:25,088
but did you believe that the first
intruder WAS your son Tom?

832
01:08:26,888 --> 01:08:29,888
You were right from the start.
I do have enemies.

833
01:08:29,888 --> 01:08:33,968
What I can't accept is how far
some of them will go.

834
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:36,808
Fine, let's talk about your enemies.

835
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:39,048
Start with the college.
What about Dr Canning?

836
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,488
Jonathan? No, no.

837
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:44,808
Come in!

838
01:08:44,808 --> 01:08:47,728
George. Thank God.
Sorry I'm interrupting, Mr Barnaby.

839
01:08:47,728 --> 01:08:50,168
What were you doing
walking in on a burglar like that?

840
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,288
Well, apparently what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.

841
01:08:53,288 --> 01:08:57,328
And we've got the Pilgrims' Ride to
sort out,

842
01:08:57,328 --> 01:08:59,328
with not much help from the college.

843
01:08:59,328 --> 01:09:01,208
That's why I'm here, to see
the bursar,

844
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:04,368
but he hasn't been very helpful.
Talk to the Master

845
01:09:04,368 --> 01:09:08,208
and remind the Master that the
domestic staff quite like the ride.

846
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,088
It's a day out for their families.

847
01:09:10,088 --> 01:09:13,968
And give Jonathan a kick up
the backside while you're here.

848
01:09:13,968 --> 01:09:17,328
Unless, of course, you think
it'll jeopardise his election.

849
01:09:17,328 --> 01:09:19,968
Our Master is retiring, Barnaby.

850
01:09:19,968 --> 01:09:21,848
Ned's son is in line to succeed.

851
01:09:25,048 --> 01:09:27,528
It's time they all grew up.

852
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:29,728
We can all get on with our lives

853
01:09:29,728 --> 01:09:31,768
as long as everyone realises
one way or another

854
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,688
I am going to stop Clinton Finn

855
01:09:33,688 --> 01:09:37,288
from manufacturing a disaster
on the back of my discoveries.

856
01:09:37,288 --> 01:09:39,808
Like everything important,
it's very simple.

857
01:09:41,088 --> 01:09:43,448
Soon as you get this, ring me,
George.

858
01:09:43,448 --> 01:09:46,528
It's about the car that killed Emily.
It's the green.

859
01:09:46,528 --> 01:09:49,448
I can't believe it, but I can't get
it out of my head.

860
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:51,688
I have to talk to you before I go to
the police.

861
01:10:57,088 --> 01:10:59,408
The ramp probably killed him.

862
01:10:59,408 --> 01:11:02,728
But I'd say he was unconscious
before he was put under it.

863
01:11:04,128 --> 01:11:06,088
Someone put him under?

864
01:11:06,088 --> 01:11:10,168
There's a blow to the head that's
nothing to do with the ramp.
It's another murder.

865
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:12,048
I think it's connected to
Emily Harte's.

866
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:14,488
Well, one thing's for sure.

867
01:11:14,488 --> 01:11:18,208
No-one would mistake Snape for
George Jeffers.

868
01:11:19,568 --> 01:11:23,168
'You have one message.'

869
01:11:23,168 --> 01:11:26,768
'Soon as you get this, ring me,
George. It's about the car
that killed Emily.

870
01:11:26,768 --> 01:11:28,408
It's the green.

871
01:11:28,408 --> 01:11:31,088
I can't believe it, but I can't get
it out of my head.

872
01:11:31,088 --> 01:11:33,048
I have to talk to you
before I go to the police.'

873
01:11:35,568 --> 01:11:39,408
I didn't check it till this morning.
What did he want us to know?

874
01:11:40,808 --> 01:11:42,928
He was talking to me about his list
of cars.

875
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:47,808
You said he was still thinking.
Sounds like he'd had a new thought.

876
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:49,728
See if Bullard's still at the
garage.

877
01:11:49,728 --> 01:11:53,208
Ask him if there's any trace, any
bit of paper,

878
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,008
anything written on the wall,
by the phone, anything.

879
01:11:56,768 --> 01:11:59,808
Er, Dr Jeffers,

880
01:11:59,808 --> 01:12:02,448
our people have enhanced
the material on your webcams.

881
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:04,408
If you put that on your computer,

882
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:07,928
maybe we can pick up on something
that could identify your intruder.

883
01:12:09,048 --> 01:12:10,928
Actually, I know who it was.

884
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,568
I've been thinking.

885
01:12:14,568 --> 01:12:17,128
And who did you think?
Clinton Finn?

886
01:12:22,768 --> 01:12:28,208
He's written something in the palm of
his hand, Tom.

887
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:30,928
Escort 63...

888
01:12:30,928 --> 01:12:33,088
And is that all?

889
01:12:33,088 --> 01:12:35,288
No. Thank you.
Thank you very much, George.

890
01:12:37,288 --> 01:12:39,248
There were no Escorts in 1963.

891
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:50,288
Mr Clinton Finn,

892
01:12:50,288 --> 01:12:54,168
two nights ago someone broke into Dr
Jeffers' house.

893
01:12:54,168 --> 01:12:58,368
When Dr Jeffers returned to his
house, the intruder was still there

894
01:12:58,368 --> 01:13:00,528
and Dr Jeffers was injured.

895
01:13:00,528 --> 01:13:03,848
I know all that.
I know you know all that, Mr Finn.

896
01:13:03,848 --> 01:13:07,928
That's why you asked Helen Markham
to give you a false alibi, isn't it?

897
01:13:07,928 --> 01:13:11,328
Well, seemed like a good idea at the
time.

898
01:13:11,328 --> 01:13:14,208
I believe, sir, that the intruder
was you.

899
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:16,808
Now, given that we have two
homicides

900
01:13:16,808 --> 01:13:20,168
which I believe are connected with
your attempt on Dr Jeffers' life,

901
01:13:20,168 --> 01:13:23,368
consider very carefully
what you're going to say.

902
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:26,808
The article you were so anxious
Jeffers shouldn't publish.

903
01:13:26,808 --> 01:13:31,408
The only way you could get hold of
this was from his computer.

904
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:34,208
I needed to know exactly what
he intended to say.

905
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:37,288
I had to try and bury him
as a serious scientist.

906
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,168
Didn't you get the information
the first time you broke in?

907
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:43,928
We used to share information freely,
but George has gone encryption mad.

908
01:13:43,928 --> 01:13:45,688
I had to try and hack in again.

909
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:48,008
He wouldn't have got hurt
if he hadn't come home.

910
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:57,208
But I didn't kill him. If I'd tried
to kill him, he'd be dead!

911
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,968
You're under arrest.

912
01:14:21,928 --> 01:14:24,248
It's perfect!

913
01:14:24,248 --> 01:14:27,848
I think I'm going to be able to do
the whole ride, you know.

914
01:14:27,848 --> 01:14:31,448
Don't you be too ambitious, Joyce.
Just cos you couldn't do it, Dad.

915
01:14:31,448 --> 01:14:33,288
I'll hold my hand up.
No, I couldn't.

916
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:35,328
You are going to be there?

917
01:14:35,328 --> 01:14:38,328
I've got to be there. Police work.
But yes, I shall be there.

918
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:41,528
Don't be so negative!
Mum might just surprise you.

919
01:14:41,528 --> 01:14:46,008
You were right to take it to an
expert.

920
01:14:46,008 --> 01:14:48,008
It's running better now than when
it was new!

921
01:15:49,247 --> 01:15:51,327
Good luck. I'll be thinking of you.

922
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:54,687
There's no excuse for you next year.
Maybe you two get a tandem!

923
01:15:54,687 --> 01:15:57,327
On your bike!

924
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,487
Ladies and gentlemen.
Before we set out,

925
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:05,887
I'd like to dedicate today's ride to
two dear friends

926
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:06,327
I'd like to dedicate today's ride to
two dear friends

927
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:10,607
who travelled the Pilgrims' Road
with me many times,

928
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:13,807
but who will travel it no more.

929
01:16:13,807 --> 01:16:17,087
This is for Dan Snape and Emily...

930
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,247
Emily Harte.

931
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:24,247
The Pilgrims' Ride! Let's go!

932
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:30,647
Are you going to wish us luck,
Jonathan?

933
01:16:30,647 --> 01:16:33,287
You've put an innocent man in jail.

934
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:36,407
You may well have scuppered
safe air travel across the world.

935
01:16:36,407 --> 01:16:39,807
You may well turn this university
into a third-rate institution!

936
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,607
Jonathan, not now, not today.

937
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:43,887
I know Clinton's become desperate,

938
01:16:43,887 --> 01:16:46,967
but I am still struggling with the
idea that he tried to kill me.

939
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:50,887
Surely it can come as no great
surprise that somebody did?

940
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:52,967
Jonathan, please. Enough.

941
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:56,967
I thought you really cared about
this place, Dad. Not any more.

942
01:17:00,007 --> 01:17:02,927
Dr Jeffers, I still don't want you
to do this.

943
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:04,887
There is someone out there -
Whoever it is

944
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:06,807
is going to have to catch me first.

945
01:17:06,807 --> 01:17:09,007
I want you to see how dangerous
this is!

946
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:13,447
I appreciate your concern,
but this is just a bike ride.

947
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:15,207
Come on, Ned.

948
01:17:15,207 --> 01:17:20,247
# Daisy, Daisy,
give me your answer do

949
01:17:20,247 --> 01:17:21,687
# Daisy, Daisy,
give me your answer do

950
01:17:21,687 --> 01:17:25,887
# I'm half crazy...

951
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,207
Keep him in sight, especially up on
the Ridgeway.

952
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:30,647
And if you do lose him, shout.

953
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:35,847
# I can't afford a carriage

954
01:17:35,847 --> 01:17:39,167
# But you'll look sweet upon the seat

955
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:42,167
# Of a bicycle made for two... #

956
01:18:16,727 --> 01:18:18,167
To the right, everybody.

957
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:21,407
Local sport and recreation, is it
today, Miss Carroll?

958
01:18:21,407 --> 01:18:23,327
It is a local paper.

959
01:18:25,607 --> 01:18:30,927
I imagine DS Jones and DC
Stephens will stay pretty close to
George Jeffers.

960
01:18:30,927 --> 01:18:33,407
We are taking every precaution.

961
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:37,527
Does this mean Clinton Finn
isn't a suspect now?

962
01:18:37,527 --> 01:18:39,567
He is helping us with our inquiries.

963
01:18:39,567 --> 01:18:45,727
Oh, you'll see in today's paper...
I didn't make a fuss. Low key.

964
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:49,047
Page four. With obituaries for Emily
Harte and Daniel Snape.

965
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:52,007
I dug that one out of the archive.

966
01:18:52,007 --> 01:18:54,527
Daniel Snape was big into rallying
in his younger days.

967
01:18:54,527 --> 01:18:55,847
Who's that with him?

968
01:18:55,847 --> 01:18:59,007
He's presenting the Midsomer Rally
Cup to Jonathan Canning.

969
01:18:59,007 --> 01:19:01,687
He's only 19 there.

970
01:19:01,687 --> 01:19:03,687
That's his father, isn't it?
Edward Canning?

971
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:06,647
Yes, he was his navigator.

972
01:19:06,647 --> 01:19:10,367
I don't know how careful THEY were
about driving around the lanes
back then.

973
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:13,487
'He's written something in the palm
of his hand, Tom!'

974
01:19:14,727 --> 01:19:17,287
Can I keep this? Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

975
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:19,847
Thank you very much, Miss Carroll.

976
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,527
Ha1

977
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:27,207
You won't keep that up, Ned!

978
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:43,167
What the hell's going on?
This Escort, is this your car, sir?

979
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,807
You walk into my college,
demand a key to my room.

980
01:19:45,807 --> 01:19:47,687
You have no right -
Is this your car, sir?

981
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,047
It was, 25 years ago.

982
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:54,567
63 wasn't the year.

983
01:19:54,567 --> 01:19:56,887
Snape was remembering the numbers
on the number plate.

984
01:19:58,687 --> 01:20:01,207
Well, you've lost me there.
Where's the car now, sir?

985
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:06,487
Well, I lost interest in rallying
a long time ago.

986
01:20:06,487 --> 01:20:10,327
Dad scrapped the car shortly after
that photo was taken.

987
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:13,767
Our Master is retiring, Barnaby.
Ned's son is in line to succeed.

988
01:20:28,607 --> 01:20:30,447
Water?

989
01:20:31,847 --> 01:20:35,167
Water?
No, thank you.

990
01:21:04,967 --> 01:21:06,967
Water?
Yes, please.

991
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:09,167
Thank you.

992
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:10,887
Well done. Keep going.
Thank you.

993
01:21:12,127 --> 01:21:14,047
Water?

994
01:21:16,487 --> 01:21:18,367
How come he's so fit?

995
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:20,047
It's called exercise, sarge.

996
01:21:50,927 --> 01:21:53,087
Hey!

997
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:02,527
Hey!

998
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,487
Careful!

999
01:23:23,567 --> 01:23:24,767
Watch it!

1000
01:24:13,607 --> 01:24:15,527
What the...?

1001
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:22,207
That's the Escort!

1002
01:24:30,847 --> 01:24:33,207
I tried to phone. No signal.
Where's Jeffers?

1003
01:24:33,207 --> 01:24:35,607
He's a few seconds in front of us.

1004
01:24:35,607 --> 01:24:38,087
He's not there now.
Where's Canning? He's our man.

1005
01:24:38,087 --> 01:24:41,727
This is THE Escort that Snape knew.
They they can't have just vanished.

1006
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:46,447
He must have gone off the track
somewhere. You two, ride back.

1007
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:49,087
See if there's any way off this
track, all right?

1008
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:50,967
Go on!

1009
01:25:15,247 --> 01:25:17,327
I've got it! Down here, sir!

1010
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:52,447
Catch him!

1011
01:25:53,887 --> 01:25:56,447
Come off there! Come here!

1012
01:26:08,828 --> 01:26:10,428
No, I'll be fine.

1013
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:12,228
Go on, Tom.
Are you sure? Yeah.

1014
01:26:19,788 --> 01:26:22,948
That's why George Jeffers came in
first, every Pilgrims' Ride.

1015
01:26:22,948 --> 01:26:25,708
Took a shortcut, didn't he?
Now there's a lesson there.

1016
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:27,668
Are you going now, sir?
No. No, I'm not.

1017
01:26:27,668 --> 01:26:29,028
You take Canning in.

1018
01:26:29,028 --> 01:26:31,468
I don't know if and when Joyce and
Cully will finish,

1019
01:26:31,468 --> 01:26:33,388
but I've got to see them do it.

1020
01:26:53,428 --> 01:26:55,348
Yes!

1021
01:26:56,228 --> 01:26:57,868
I finished! I finished!

1022
01:26:57,868 --> 01:27:01,668
Well done! Well done, both of you!
What do you say to that, Dad?

1023
01:27:01,668 --> 01:27:04,588
I never doubted her for a moment.

1024
01:27:04,588 --> 01:27:06,548
What's happened, Chief Inspector?

1025
01:27:06,548 --> 01:27:09,508
My wife and my daughter have just
completed the Pilgrims' Ride.

1026
01:27:09,508 --> 01:27:11,388
You arrested someone?

1027
01:27:11,388 --> 01:27:13,948
Miss Carroll, you come and see me
tomorrow morning.

1028
01:27:13,948 --> 01:27:15,908
No. Er, listen,

1029
01:27:15,908 --> 01:27:18,268
the Advertiser's going to need
a picture.

1030
01:27:18,268 --> 01:27:22,108
So what about a shot of
Cully and Joyce Barnaby?

1031
01:27:22,108 --> 01:27:24,588
That'd make a pretty good front
page, wouldn't it, eh?

1032
01:27:24,588 --> 01:27:27,788
Cully, Joyce. Causton Advertiser.

1033
01:27:37,148 --> 01:27:39,548
I didn't think anyone would
remember the car.

1034
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,268
Daniel did.

1035
01:27:43,268 --> 01:27:45,348
He remembered the colour.

1036
01:27:45,348 --> 01:27:48,268
I know that he believed me when
I told him it had been broken up,

1037
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:51,468
but for how long? He could still
have said something to you.

1038
01:27:53,228 --> 01:27:55,788
Why couldn't he leave it alone?

1039
01:27:55,788 --> 01:27:58,668
Even Jonathan thought the car had
gone to the breakers.

1040
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:06,468
Those years, when he drove,
I was his navigator.

1041
01:28:06,468 --> 01:28:09,028
We were still close then. We're not
close any more

1042
01:28:09,028 --> 01:28:12,868
because he's in a different world
and I don't belong in it.

1043
01:28:12,868 --> 01:28:17,508
But he does!
But wasn't it YOUR college too?

1044
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:21,028
I was head porter,
a college servant.

1045
01:28:21,028 --> 01:28:22,948
It's nothing.

1046
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:30,668
I never dreamed that my son
would be Master.

1047
01:28:30,668 --> 01:28:33,548
I couldn't let George take that
away. And he wouldn't stop.

1048
01:28:33,548 --> 01:28:36,268
I knew he wouldn't stop until
he'd he'd ruined it all.

1049
01:28:37,988 --> 01:28:39,908
I had to do it for my son.

1050
01:28:42,628 --> 01:28:44,708
I didn't know it was Emily.
How could I?

1051
01:28:46,148 --> 01:28:48,348
I thought it was him.

1052
01:28:48,348 --> 01:28:50,828
I watched him coming out the house.
I followed him.

1053
01:29:20,228 --> 01:29:23,908
I didn't know.
But you knew it was Daniel Snape.

1054
01:29:23,908 --> 01:29:25,188
Well, it was too late.

1055
01:29:29,468 --> 01:29:31,388
I had no choice.

1056
01:29:43,988 --> 01:29:46,708
Why didn't Snape just tell us?

1057
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:49,948
He didn't want to till he'd talked
to Jeffers. Wanted to be sure.

1058
01:29:49,948 --> 01:29:52,668
And he didn't entirely trust us.
No, that didn't help.

1059
01:29:52,668 --> 01:29:55,708
Anyway, it's over.
Even the Bucketman.

1060
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:58,108
Afraid not.
That was to put us off the scent.

1061
01:29:58,108 --> 01:29:59,308
He's still out there.

1062
01:30:00,988 --> 01:30:03,428
Ah, Barnaby.

1063
01:30:03,428 --> 01:30:05,708
We have a confession to make.

1064
01:30:12,668 --> 01:30:14,908
Right glue...

1065
01:30:14,908 --> 01:30:17,028
Right paint.

1066
01:30:18,828 --> 01:30:21,108
I knew he'd guessed.

1067
01:30:21,108 --> 01:30:24,108
I thought it was him breaking into
the house to find out for sure.

1068
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:26,388
It wasn't.

1069
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:28,948
But you took over from him anyway,
didn't you, Tom?

1070
01:30:28,948 --> 01:30:31,508
Like father, like son.

1071
01:30:31,508 --> 01:30:36,188
Thought the attack on Helen
Markham's car wasn't quite
the Bucketman's style.

1072
01:30:36,188 --> 01:30:37,948
So what are we going to do, Barnaby?

1073
01:30:37,948 --> 01:30:41,868
Well, I don't know, but we have
a problem, don't we?

1074
01:30:41,868 --> 01:30:45,748
When two almost, but not quite,
identical Bucketmen

1075
01:30:45,748 --> 01:30:49,188
appear at almost, but not quite,
the same time,

1076
01:30:49,188 --> 01:30:53,308
fibrillation can and does occur in
the police investigative system.

1077
01:30:53,308 --> 01:30:56,468
We have a glitch, Dr Jeffers.
We can't have that, can we?

1078
01:30:58,068 --> 01:31:01,148
So why don't we...put all this

1079
01:31:01,148 --> 01:31:04,068
back...in the bag...

1080
01:31:08,028 --> 01:31:10,908
..and...close it?

1081
01:31:12,428 --> 01:31:15,628
Thank you.
Ah, the Bucketmen!

1082
01:31:18,588 --> 01:31:22,148
It doesn't suit you any more than
it suited me, George.

1083
01:31:22,148 --> 01:31:26,628
No. A taste of my own medicine.

1084
01:31:26,628 --> 01:31:30,268
So you're not pressing charges?
I don't think so.

1085
01:31:32,828 --> 01:31:36,748
So how do we iron out this glitch
in the air traffic control system?

1086
01:31:36,748 --> 01:31:39,628
I'll give you a year.
It's ridiculous.

1087
01:31:39,628 --> 01:31:42,908
You still have no concept of how
a scientist works!

1088
01:31:42,908 --> 01:31:46,348
OK, two, tops.
Oh, hell. Let me buy you a drink.

1089
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:49,988
I'm not leaving it in the rain.

1090
01:31:49,988 --> 01:31:52,708
No, no. Right, right.
We can't get the door shut.

1091
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:54,868
You'll have to throw out
some more of this junk.

1092
01:31:54,868 --> 01:31:57,348
Why don't we start with this?

1093
01:31:57,348 --> 01:32:00,628
Don't be provocative, Tom.

1094
01:32:00,628 --> 01:32:04,788
A time will come when this has to go
back on the bike.

1095
01:32:04,788 --> 01:32:07,548
It's nothing Cully said, but...

1096
01:32:07,548 --> 01:32:09,428
I have a feeling that it won't be
long.

1097
01:32:09,428 --> 01:32:13,668
Ah, well, dream things true. Come on.

1098
01:32:19,148 --> 01:32:21,028
Come on, we'll drink to that.

1099
01:32:35,588 --> 01:32:39,428
