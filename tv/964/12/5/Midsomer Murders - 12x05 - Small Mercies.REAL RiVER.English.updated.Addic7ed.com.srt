1
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:16,358
Hey.

2
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:21,238
On your feet, Thomas.
There's a good lad.

3
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,638
Whoops.

4
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,678
Go on, there's a brave lad.

5
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:04,998
Come on.

6
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:45,518
Yes, all right! That's enough
of that.

7
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:50,438
Ah, did you hear me, George?

8
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:02,838
What's going on?

9
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,918
Dunno. Saw the Compton sisters
walking past.

10
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:08,078
In a hurry.

11
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:33,398
Edward, what was all the noise
about?

12
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:35,238
It was a police car.
A police car!

13
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:37,078
Lunchtime menu?

14
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:40,438
I thought we'd have tomato and herb
soup today. It's nice and
refreshing.

15
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:50,918
This way.

16
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,278
What the hell...?

17
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:53,798
Come along. Hurry up.

18
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:59,238
Will you let us in, please?

19
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:02,118
Sorry. Can't. For goodness
sake, it's our property.

20
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,038
That may be the case, madam,
but it's now a crime scene.

21
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,678
Ridiculous...
Please, madam!

22
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:08,918
Morning, sir.

23
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:10,918
Thank you, Stephens. Thank you.

24
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,758
I said let us in!

25
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:16,238
Surely you know who we are!
I'm Hilary Compton.

26
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:19,158
We needn't explain ourselves.
This is my sister, Harriet.

27
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,278
Sir.

28
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,998
Yes, Jones.

29
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:25,678
I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Barnaby, Causton CID. Excuse me,
please.

30
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,758
And before anyone asks, sir.

31
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,638
His name's not Gulliver.

32
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,478
What is his name?

33
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:47,918
Richard Tanner, sir.

34
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,278
He lives local.

35
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:50,638
Who found him?

36
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,438
Bob Moss. He works here.

37
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:56,478
Well, one thing's for sure.

38
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,438
He didn't kill himself.

39
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,598
Where's forensics?
Bullard's on the way.

40
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,438
All those bits of string?
He'll love this.

41
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,078
STEPHENS: Stop!

42
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:08,038
In case you people have failed to
realise it. Harriet!

43
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,238
It may be the end of the season,
but we still have a business to run.

44
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,118
Wait!

45
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,318
Sorry, sir.

46
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,638
Right, that's enough. Let's go.

47
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:22,438
Please. Thank you.

48
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,838
You could have told us.

49
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,518
Guess what?

50
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,838
The police have found a body.

51
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,718
Here in the village.

52
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:47,798
A body?

53
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,078
Edward, that's terrible.

54
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:54,038
Are you having one of your jokes?

55
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:57,038
We heard a police car.

56
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,518
What do you mean, a body?

57
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,718
Whose body?

58
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:04,398
How do I know? Probably some poor sod
died of boredom.

59
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:15,358
When did you find him, Mr Moss?

60
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,358
Just after nine.

61
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,478
Did you see anyone else here?

62
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,798
No. Anyway, we don't open till 10.

63
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:28,758
He was trouble, but he didn't
deserve this.

64
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:31,078
How do you mean he was trouble?

65
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:33,638
Well, he used to trespass,
come in after hours.

66
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:34,958
Why?

67
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:38,478
It was his way. He didn't respect
private property.

68
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,278
Almost cost me my job.

69
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,998
Several times. Because I could not
keep him out.

70
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,078
Do you happen to know
his next of kin, sir?

71
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,438
Um...there's only his sister Jackie,
who runs the craft shop.

72
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,198
So when can I clean up
all this mess?

73
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,398
Can't leave it like this.

74
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,158
And them all covered in blood.

75
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:59,198
No, no, Mr Moss. Nothing is to be
touched.

76
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:03,198
And we'll need to talk to you again.
Where can we find you?

77
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:05,118
Well...I'll be in my workshop.

78
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,838
Looks like he received a penetrating
wound, right side, lower back.

79
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,718
So...we're looking for a weapon.

80
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,798
A knife, sharp tool.

81
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,078
Time of death?

82
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,038
We won't know until we untangle him.

83
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:37,198
What about the string and the pegs?

84
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,438
Yeah, it would have happened after
death.

85
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:42,558
I'd say he was attacked there
and dragged over here.

86
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,318
Where he could be tied up.
Yeah.

87
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:47,838
Some of these figures would have
been knocked over,

88
00:08:47,838 --> 00:08:50,078
so whoever killed him must have
replaced them.

89
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,598
Yeah. Why?

90
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:15,118

104
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,147
Not for sale, I'm afraid.

105
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,667
I bet you're glad of that.

106
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,707
Yes, well, no, it...

107
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,547
doesn't look very seaworthy.

108
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,947
That's the idea. It's for the crazy
craft race.

109
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,387
The crazy what?

110
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:59,147
It's an end-of-season event at
Little Worthy, sir.

111
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:01,107
It happens every year.

112
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,387
It's the only bit of fun we have.

113
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:05,267
Are you Jackie Tanner?

114
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,787
Yeah.

115
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:11,947
I am Detective Chief Inspector
Barnaby and this is Detective
Constable Stephens from Causton CID.

116
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,427
What's he done now?

117
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,107
I'm sorry. Who?

118
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:20,107
Richard. My brother.

119
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,307
Been upsetting the locals again,
has he?

120
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,947
Hmm!

121
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:27,427
Anyway, he'd had a couple of drinks
when he broke the windows of the
tea room.

122
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,307
But it was an accident.

123
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:34,587
He, er...was aiming at those naff
plastic tables they've got outside.

124
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:37,987
Ooh. He hates them. Well...he hates
anything that isn't real.

125
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:47,307
What is it? What's wrong?

126
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:52,787
Miss Tanner, I regret to inform you
that your brother, Richard Tanner,

127
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,667
is dead.

128
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:58,867
I am sorry to have to bring this news

129
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,747
to you.

130
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,747
What are you saying to me?

131
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,227
How can he be dead? He can't be.

132
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:15,227
How...?

133
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:19,827
His killing was unlawful. We believe
that he was murdered.

134
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,387
Please, no.

135
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,267
Not Richard.
Come on, sit down, Jackie.

136
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,307
Miss Tanner, of course...

137
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:33,347
I...have to ask you some questions.

138
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:34,987
These are very important.

139
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:38,867
When did you last see your brother?

140
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,867
Yesterday, maybe.

141
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,827
Early yesterday.

142
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,587
Did they kill him?

143
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,507
Who's they?

144
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,387
The locals.

145
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:56,147
Most of them hated him.

146
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:58,107
Did they? Why? What reason?

147
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,267
He, um...

148
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:06,227
He didn't want Little Worthy
changed in any way. He...

149
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:08,107
didn't like anything new.

150
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:12,387
So if someone suggested changes,
improvements...

151
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,227
He'd fight it.

152
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:20,347
Miss Tanner, where was your brother
when you last saw him?

153
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,667
That teacher...

154
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:28,267
Rebecca. That bitch would never
leave him alone.

155
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,547
He's my...half-brother, actually.

156
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,907
I loved him like a real brother!

157
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:40,027
Oh, Richard!

158
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,587
Where was this?

159
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:55,507
It was over there.

160
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:59,267
Looks as if he spent some time here
with someone last night.

161
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:02,147
These pegs are pretty standard.

162
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:06,387
They can be found in most hardware
or outdoor activity stores.

163
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,027
And the twine?

164
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:10,027
Arts and crafts shops.
Garden centres.

165
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,707
I need to move him soon, Ben, and
the whole place needs to be
searched.

166
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,347
We'll arrange it.

167
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:28,027
Don't forget the far table.

168
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,387
Please.

169
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,067
Oh, for God's sake.

170
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,427
Hardly anyone comes in here at the
best of times.

171
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:41,307
You know your father likes the
restaurant to be as welcoming as
possible, just in case.

172
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:44,027
What? With a dead body and police
everywhere?

173
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:47,667
Lay the table, please.

174
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,667
Would you like me to show you
how to fold a napkin

175
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,187
to make it look like a bird? I've
been learning how to do it.

176
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,027
You know your problem, don't you?

177
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,507
You've got a few of your pages
stuck together.

178
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:28,587
Oh, it's you!

179
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:31,787
I thought it was her. She doesn't
like me smoking.

180
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:33,707
Which one?

181
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:35,427
Harriet.
Oh, Harriet. Yes.

182
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,587
Is she a miss or a mrs?

183
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,467
She's always known as MISS Compton.

184
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,147
Never married.

185
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:44,027
Who'd want her?

186
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,027
And her sister?

187
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,947
Hilary? Yeah, she was wed once.

188
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,827
Years ago.

189
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,627
Still a young bride
when her husband died.

190
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:56,067
Went back to using her maiden name.

191
00:15:56,947 --> 00:16:00,467
Still, they do all right for
themselves. I mean, they own half
the village.

192
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,187
And how long have you worked
for them?

193
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,107
40 years.

194
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,067
Not easy years either.

195
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,907
They're church people.

196
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:11,347
They didn't want a model pub in the
model village.

197
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:15,867
I had to argue until I was blue in
the face before they'd let me make
one.

198
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:18,667
If they had their way...

199
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:22,547
none of these figures would have
a smile on their face.

200
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:26,187
Mmmm.

201
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:28,027
Oh, yeah, yeah.

202
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:30,107
That's Arnold. In for a bit of a
spruce up.

203
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:33,907
Come on then.

204
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,507
What time did you leave here last
night, Mr Moss?

205
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:39,387
Ah, locked up at six.

206
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:42,067
Left about 6:45.

207
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,907
Home at seven.

208
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:47,307
And this workshop, this was locked up
too, was it?

209
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,107
Always is.

210
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,147
Do you have family, Mr Moss?

211
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,347
I never needed one.

212
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,147
Is there anyone who can confirm
what time you got home?

213
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:58,667
No.

214
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,187
Richard Tanner was stabbed some time
last night.

215
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:03,827
When was the last time
you saw him, sir?

216
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:06,107
I forget.
Ever seen him with any friends?

217
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:08,067
I don't think he had any.

218
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,467
Oh, come on, what about the local
schoolteacher?

219
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:13,027
Yeah, well...I did see him with her
once or twice.

220
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:15,627
Did you kill him, Mr Moss?

221
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,787
Me?!

222
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:21,507
Well, no, no...no.

223
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,787
No!

224
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,667
Well, you had good cause.

225
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,547
You said he almost cost you your job.

226
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,507
Yeah...I know, but...

227
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,627
Being out of work at your age...

228
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,507
could be difficult.

229
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:56,867
What's the matter, love?

230
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,467
Has Christa been rude to you again?

231
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,747
Just give it time.

232
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:09,627
Things will get better.

233
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,267
Since her mother left,
I'm all she has.

234
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:16,947
She's just a bit jealous,
that's all.

235
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,227
I couldn't be without you, Bernice.

236
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:26,187
Not now.

237
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:28,707
I couldn't bear it.

238
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,587
Miss Rix?
Yes?

239
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,627
Could I have a word, please?

240
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,627
I haven't seen Richard
for a couple of days.

241
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,427
Can you remember exactly when?

242
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:45,427
Well, I'd have to think about it.

243
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,147
Or where?

244
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:49,187
Oh, that's easy.

245
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:51,347
We went to the model village
together.

246
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,387
He wanted to get ideas
for the craft race.

247
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:56,067
Why are you asking me?

248
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:58,187
Richard Tanner's dead.

249
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:02,107
He's been murdered.

250
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,587
Moss? You spoke with Moss before
coming to see us?

251
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:01,187
Yes, Miss Compton.

252
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:02,867
That's disgraceful.

253
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,947
The man's responsible for what's
happened. He's brought it upon us.

254
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,907
All right, Harriet!

255
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,427
I'm sorry. Why - is he responsible?

256
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,507
Because he smokes while he's
working.

257
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:15,827
Even though we've told him not to.

258
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:20,347
And he insisted we open the model
village on a Sunday. I shall never
forgive him for that.

259
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:23,147
Get rid of him, Hilary. Get rid of
him now.

260
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:25,427
I can't! We need him.

261
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:27,547
Like we need death?

262
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:29,547
And blood spilled here on our
doorstep?

263
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:34,467
Maybe the Devil got him at last.

264
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:38,067
I remember him when I taught
at Sunday school.

265
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,267
In the days before...

266
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:42,227
Bible classes were a thing
of the past.

267
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:45,987
Harriet! I'm sure Mr Barnaby hasn't
come to talk about Bible class.

268
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,907
Even as a young pupil, he was always
causing disruption.

269
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:52,067
Well...

270
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,347
The Devil's children are renowned
for that.

271
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:00,027
I've nothing more to say.

272
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:02,787
I have things to do.

273
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:11,867
In many ways, Richard Tanner was
right. He simply wanted to protect
the village from change.

274
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:15,667
Do you think that could have been
the reason...to kill him?

275
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,547
No!

276
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:20,467
Have you got any idea who did
kill him?

277
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:22,827
Well...

278
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:24,947
No.

279
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,587
My family have lived at Little
Worthy for generations.

280
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,707
I love the place.

281
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,387
But as a tourist village,
it HAS to change.

282
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:37,507
Ah. Um...yes, I don't want to make
things worse for you, Miss Compton,

283
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:40,507
but the model village is out of
bounds to the public

284
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,627
for the time being. I'm sorry.

285
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,507
I thought it might be.

286
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:48,027
Do the locals know who was murdered?

287
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,467
Ah, not everyone. We haven't released
that information yet.

288
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,067
Then I wouldn't bother,
if I were you.

289
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,467
Knowing Little Worthy, they'll have
worked it out by now.

290
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:01,267
No!

291
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,947
No!

292
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:16,947
NO!

293
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,547
I think we should open up this room
a bit next year.

294
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:47,507
Put more of the tables outside.

295
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:49,387
The person who died?

296
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:52,667
It was Richard Tanner.

297
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,187
He'd been stabbed to death.

298
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,987
That's all this village needs.

299
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,347
Who's next, I wonder?

Ah, Miss Rix, this is Detective
Chief Inspector Barnaby.

307
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:37,787
Miss Rix.

308
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:40,587
Er...I was just about to lock up.
Go home.

309
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,827
Well, perhaps you could spare us a
moment or two before you go home.

310
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:45,707
If...if it's about Richard...

311
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:49,107
I can't even begin to think about it
right now.

312
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:52,907
Look, Miss Rix...we need to catch
his killer as soon as possible.

00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:56,027
And we need...all the help
we can get.

314
00:23:56,987 --> 00:24:00,187
I've spoken to Richard's sister,
Jackie Tanner.

315
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:02,947
And I bet she had all sorts of nice
things to say about me.

316
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,587
Well, she did mention...

317
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,467
Well, what she actually said was...

318
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:11,947
'That bitch would never leave
my brother alone.'

319
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:14,267
Oh, that's great, coming from her.

320
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:16,827
That cow is so possessive.

321
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:19,987
She's the one who wouldn't
leave him alone.

322
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,467
Were you and Richard Tanner lovers?

323
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,147
We were an item once.

Yes.

00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,187
What went wrong?

326
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:37,507
He dumped me.

327
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:41,267
OK, so it hurt at the time.

328
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,147
I'm...

329
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:45,867
I can't really handle rejection.

330
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:50,027
Were you with Richard Tanner
last night?

331
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,627
In the model village?

332
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:52,987
No!

333
00:24:52,987 --> 00:24:54,867
I've already told him.

334
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,707
I haven't seen Richard since...

335
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:00,307
Now, hang on.

336
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,947
I may hate what he did to me, but...

337
00:25:02,947 --> 00:25:04,987
I wouldn't hurt him.

338
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,467
I could never do that.

339
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:07,827
Who could?

340
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:08,947
Lots of people.

341
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:10,827
Name one.

342
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:13,747
Well, for a start there's
Mike Johnson, from the gift shop.

343
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:15,827
Richard threatened him once.

344
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:17,867
For what reason?

345
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,827
The randy git tried it on
with his sister.

346
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:21,467
God knows why.

347
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,387
Would have thought she needed
livening up.

348
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:25,347
Did Richard have a girlfriend?

349
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:27,307
Well, there's that kid from
the hotel.

350
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:29,027
But I'd hardly call her
a girlfriend.

351
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,467
Why?

352
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,027
Because she's too young!

353
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:33,507
That's why.

354
00:25:34,747 --> 00:25:36,627
It was probably just a friendship.

355
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,947
It's a nice lot of pictures
you've got here.

356
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,787
Oh...yes!

357
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,907
The children.

358
00:25:46,907 --> 00:25:48,987
They're great. They love their
painting.

359
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:52,707
Why...Gulliver?

360
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:55,547
We always have a theme week.

361
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:58,547
Someone in the village thinks
of an idea and we do it.

362
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:02,027
Last week, it was...the old woman
who lives in a shoe.

363
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,907
The week before that, it was...

364
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:06,747
Oh, something.

365
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:09,147
So, who...suggested Gulliver?

366
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,667
Ah...

367
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,987
I think it was Edward Palfrey
from the hotel.

368
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,467
Look...I really do need to get home!

369
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,627
Miss Rix...

370
00:26:19,627 --> 00:26:22,027
How would you characterise
Richard Tanner?

371
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:23,867
What would you say? That he was a...

372
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:25,747
big man in a small world?

373
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:28,427
Well...

374
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:30,187
Yes.

375
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:32,067
With his way of expressing himself,

376
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:34,867
he certainly was too big for
Little Worthy.

377
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,227
Why do you ask?

378
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:39,387
Because...

379
00:26:39,387 --> 00:26:42,667
that is how Richard Tanner
was found.

380
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,387
Tied down.

381
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:47,947
Allowed to bleed to death.

382
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:51,107
And no-one there to help him.

383
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:11,764
Today has been terrible.

384
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,804
All we've sold is one pair of oven
gloves.

385
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:16,524
Oh, and one joke skeleton.

386
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:19,244
Almost no passing trade.

387
00:27:20,084 --> 00:27:22,244
One of the policemen bought the
skeleton.

388
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:25,618
You could say Richard Tanner had it
coming, Kate.

389
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:27,658
He did upset a lot of people.

390
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:29,538
Upset them enough to kill him?

391
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:38,938
I was saying to Mike we should have
a Mystical Moments grotto next
season.

392
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:42,778
In the corner of the garden.

393
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:47,338
Some people like all that weird
stuff.

394
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:50,938
Where's that box of cinnamon
candles?

395
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:53,298
In the storeroom.

396
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,258
Well, I want them in here.

397
00:28:04,938 --> 00:28:07,058
Tonight still OK?

398
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:08,938
Oh yeah.

399
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,378
On the shelf by the window.

400
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,138
Christa.

401
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:41,298
Christa!

402
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:43,578
Bernice has finished your sea nymph
costume.

403
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,338
It looks wonderful.

404
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,698
Christa.

405
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,218
We realise you're upset. But please
open the door.

406
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:00,098
Please talk to us.

407
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:02,058
Just piss off!

408
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,098
Can I help?

409
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:48,418
Yes, I'm looking for Michael Johnson.

410
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:50,658
Oh, that's me.
Ah. Afternoon, sir.

411
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:54,498
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby
from Causton CID.

412
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:56,418
Oh, right.

413
00:29:56,818 --> 00:29:59,738
It's, er...it's about Richard Tanner.

414
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,338
You knew him?

415
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:04,698
Well, of course, yeah.
Poor old Richard.

416
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:06,498
He was certainly part of the
village.

417
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:08,538
Yes, yes...

418
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:10,418
Did you like him?

419
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:12,698
No.

420
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:14,978
But like most people, I put up
with him.

421
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:18,578
Yeah, I understand you had a little
argument with him quite recently.

422
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:21,298
A what?

423
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,658
About his half-sister, Jackie Tanner.

424
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,538
Who told you that?

425
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:30,058
Yeah, well, did you have the argument
or not?

426
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:32,418
Well...it wasn't exactly
an argument.

427
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:34,898
He just told me to, er...

428
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:37,178
Well, leave his sister alone.

429
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:39,898
He didn't want her getting hurt.

430
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,698
And did you...leave her alone?

431
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:44,138
I wasn't exactly interested
in the first place.

432
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:48,778
Mr Johnson, would you mind telling me
where you were last night?

433
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,378
(Or is that a problem?)

434
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:01,058
Not at all. No.

435
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,978
Um...I went to bed about 12.

436
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:05,938
Before that?

437
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:08,938
Well, I was working late.

438
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:10,898
Building a craft for the race.

439
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:13,138
Out in the forecourt.

440
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,578
Er...the race can still go ahead,
can it?

441
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:19,098
Oh, yes, providing it doesn't
interfere with our investigations.

442
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:21,218
Yeah, it's the one village fun day.

443
00:31:21,218 --> 00:31:23,098
Wouldn't want to lose that.

444
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:27,898
I'm going to be Neptune.

445
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:29,898
What do you think?

446
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:32,138
Thank you, Mr Johnson. Thank you
very much.

447
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,178
I'm sorry, but she still won't
open her door.

448
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:50,818
Can we help?

449
00:31:50,818 --> 00:31:52,698
I believe she was seeing Richard
Tanner?

450
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,578
Seeing him?

451
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:57,058
Surely not. She's still only
a child.

452
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,178
Obviously a very upset child.

453
00:32:00,178 --> 00:32:02,218
Well, only because we knew
the poor man.

454
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:06,298
He'd come here to eat and
Christa always liked to serve him.

455
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:09,018
He used to make her laugh.

456
00:32:09,018 --> 00:32:10,418
Almost two of a kind.

457
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:12,058
In what way?

458
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:14,218
Well, let's just say that...

459
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:16,338
they're the sort who never
really fit in.

460
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:19,378
He used to go his own way and...

461
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:21,338
Christa's always been, well...

462
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:23,578
difficult.

463
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,978
But she'll grow out of it.
You always said she would.

464
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:32,458
So when was Richard last here?

465
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,618
Yesterday evening. He had just
a bar meal.

466
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,218
What sort of mood was he in?

467
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:40,858
His usual self, joking and stuff.

468
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:43,098
And Christa was in all evening?

469
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:44,178
No.

470
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,338
She went out later.

471
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:50,178
She's got a couple of schoolfriends.
They've been making plans about the
craft race.

472
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,338
What time did she get back?

473
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,578
Ah...quite late. Long after we'd
closed.

474
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,018
I'd gone to bed early.

475
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,898
Leaving me to tidy up as usual.

476
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:04,418
Just one wound,

477
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:06,298
but it was enough.

478
00:33:07,138 --> 00:33:09,378
Penetrated the liver and the gall
bladder.

479
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:13,418
Maybe he was turning away
as the blow was struck.

480
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:15,258
Yes.

481
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:17,618
The shape of the wound is the shape
of the blade.

482
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,498
Roundish.

483
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,938
So the weapon you're looking for
has a blade...

484
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:25,978
..four to five inches in length.

485
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:29,378
With a diameter of 16mill.

486
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,458
Which is five eighths of an inch
in old money.

487
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,218
Like a stiletto.

488
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:35,178
How much force was used?

489
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:37,178
None was needed.

490
00:33:37,178 --> 00:33:39,458
As I've said so many times before,

491
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:43,178
our creator was guilty of a few
design faults when he made human
beings.

492
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:47,218
Vital organs too close
to the surface of the skin.

493
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:49,658
Oh, but George, he gave us a brain
to compensate.

494
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,818
That was the biggest design fault
of all.

495
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:04,018
Christa.

496
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:06,178
I'm so glad you've come down.

497
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:13,618
I'm going to my country dancing
class in a while if you want to come
with me?

498
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:17,178
You must be joking.

499
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:18,578
No.

500
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:22,418
I wish I knew what my dad
sees in you.

501
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,178
He...

502
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:26,778
Well, we love each other.

503
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:28,858
You don't even know
what that word means.

504
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:33,138
Because it's not just smiley faces
and all that happy ever after crap.

505
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,178
It's hell.

506
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:37,098
It hurts.

507
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:19,178
That's the way!

508
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:26,578
And sway.

509
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,378
Right, Steve, let's have you
on the floor.

510
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:27,698
But I can't dance.

511
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:29,658
Course you can!

512
00:36:32,498 --> 00:36:35,218
Take your partners for the
Cumberland Square Eight.

513
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,018
Mmmm!

514
00:36:47,258 --> 00:36:49,698
What a sickly pong in here.

515
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,338
I don't know how you put up with it.

516
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,498
Do you know, I don't even notice it
any more.

517
00:36:55,498 --> 00:36:57,378
Well, I do.

518
00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:59,778
It's amazing.

519
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,298
You're the only man I know...

520
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:05,298
who smells like a poof,

521
00:37:05,298 --> 00:37:07,178
and shags like a rhino.

522
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:11,498
Right.

523
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,138
Come here.

524
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:46,178
Well done, Steve.

525
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:58,338
What was that?

526
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:00,818
I didn't hear anything.

527
00:38:01,618 --> 00:38:03,658
It sounded like the letterbox.

528
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:05,538
At this time of night?

529
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:23,498
It couldn't have been
the letterbox.

530
00:38:24,058 --> 00:38:26,978
It must be the dustbin lids.
I told Moss to fix them.

531
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,938
I told you so.

532
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:30,538
Oh...

533
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:33,058
Wait.

534
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:39,698
It must have come through the door
and rolled under there.

535
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:41,658
What on earth can it be?

536
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:00,682
Oh, thanks, Steve.

537
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:02,602
Just put it down there.

538
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:13,242
I love what you've done
to this shop.

539
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:15,882
It's...

540
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:18,922
Well, it has such a comforting
feel to it.

541
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,402
Good. I'm glad you like it.

542
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:24,842
There's not much comfort in Little
Worthy at the moment.

543
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:28,882
End of a lousy season and police
all over the place.

544
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:30,282
Mmm.

545
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,802
I hope I didn't make a fool
of myself last night.

546
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:38,002
No, of course not. You were fine.

547
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:46,162
I'd much rather be running a shop
like this than a tea room.

548
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:49,042
Well, I'm glad someone
appreciates it.

549
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:52,282
Mike doesn't.

550
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:55,162
He says it's all a bit too fussy
for him.

551
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:58,242
I'm afraid he's not a buttons
and bows man.

552
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:01,242
He scares me sometimes.

553
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:02,642
Why?

554
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:04,442
I just don't know
what he gets up to.

555
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:11,602
It feels so good to touch,
doesn't it?

556
00:40:13,642 --> 00:40:15,842
Sad, really.

557
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:18,962
I have so many glamorous things
to wear.

558
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:22,442
Exotic things,
some people might call them.

559
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:24,602
Naughty things.

560
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,762
But I've no-one to wear them for.

561
00:40:39,362 --> 00:40:41,282
How much do I owe you for this?

562
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:45,362
Oh, Detective Sergeant,
please come in.

563
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:49,202
Thank you for coming.

564
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:51,402
No problem.

565
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:54,922
We...we would have contacted
you last night, but it was late.

566
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:58,482
Which means we've had to spend the
whole night worrying about it.

567
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,402
Worrying about what?

568
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:01,922
This!

569
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:06,042
It was put through our letterbox
last night without so much as a
by-your-leave.

570
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:10,162
See, that's the sort of person we
have to deal with in this village.

571
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,522
Down there.

572
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,122
Thank you.

573
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:28,402
Christa?

574
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,202
I'm Tom Barnaby.

575
00:41:33,962 --> 00:41:36,082
Are you a policeman?

576
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:37,482
Ah yes, I am.

577
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:39,402
But I'm not a bad person.

578
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:41,802
I love the costume.

579
00:41:43,922 --> 00:41:46,002
Ah...

580
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:47,882
Christa.

581
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:50,962
May I...

582
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:53,602
talk to you a little bit about
Richard Tanner?

583
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:56,282
I believe he was a friend of yours?

584
00:41:57,162 --> 00:41:59,082
We were more than friends.

585
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:01,442
We were lovers.

586
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,042
And were you with him...the night
before last?

587
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,922
The night he died?

588
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:10,362
Yes.

589
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,402
Where was this?

590
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:14,162
The model village.

591
00:42:14,162 --> 00:42:17,642
A strange place to meet, wasn't it?
A model village, late at night.

592
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:19,762
No. Not really.

593
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:21,762
We liked it there.

594
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:23,682
We used to climb over the wall...

595
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:26,682
have a smoke,

596
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:28,882
make love.

597
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,922
He used to say the model village had
more going for it than the real one.

598
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:34,802
He was right.

599
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:37,282
We were going to go away together.

600
00:42:37,842 --> 00:42:39,762
Were you? Where to?

601
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:41,682
Dunno.

602
00:42:41,682 --> 00:42:43,482
Somewhere.

603
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:47,562
Christa, what time exactly did you
leave the model village that night?

604
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:50,762
Must have been just after 12.

605
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:52,842
Did you see anyone else there?

606
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,322
No.

607
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,842
And didn't Richard want to leave
with you at the same time?

608
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:59,042
No.

609
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,962
He said he wanted to finish
his smoke.

610
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:02,522
I wasn't happy about that.

611
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:03,802
Why not?

612
00:43:03,802 --> 00:43:06,682
Cos I didn't like letting him out
of my sight, that's why.

613
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:08,562
I hated it when he saw other women.

614
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:11,002
Especially that creepy teacher.

615
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:13,162
Christa, how can you talk like this?

616
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:16,242
You just stay away from me.

617
00:43:16,482 --> 00:43:18,482
I loved him.

618
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:20,282
All right?

619
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:22,522
So don't go on about him being
too old for me.

620
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:24,482
Because who are you to talk?

621
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,682
Bernice is half your age.

622
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:29,162
She cares about me and she cares
about you!

623
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:32,602
And you only managed to pull her
because she's three tomatoes short
of a salad.

624
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:38,482
Look at you.

625
00:43:38,722 --> 00:43:40,682
Who else would want you?

626
00:43:46,202 --> 00:43:48,082
I'm sorry about this, Mr Barnaby.

627
00:43:50,922 --> 00:43:53,122
He was shoved through their
letterbox?

628
00:43:53,122 --> 00:43:54,562
Yes.

629
00:43:54,562 --> 00:43:57,082
Well...I suppose it could be kids.

630
00:43:57,442 --> 00:43:59,522
Why kids?

631
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:01,682
They sometimes nick 'em.

632
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:04,442
Course someone could have found him
in the street.

633
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,322
Decided to return him.

634
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:13,322
Now, what do you want to go
wandering off for, eh?

635
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:16,202
Ha!

636
00:44:16,602 --> 00:44:18,282
Right.

637
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,602
Better brush you up a bit.

638
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,962
Ah...thank you...Mr Moss.

639
00:44:22,962 --> 00:44:25,362
You can have this back when we've
finished with it.

640
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,242
But he belongs here!

641
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:29,842
The Compton sisters.

642
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:33,122
Do they have anything to do with
the craft race?

643
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,642
Hilary does.

644
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:37,562
Not Harriet.

645
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,922
She hates it.

646
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:43,322
Thank you.

647
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,082
Oh...

648
00:45:02,562 --> 00:45:03,882
Robert!

649
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:12,202
You were talking to the police again
behind our backs, weren't you?

650
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:13,522
Eh?

651
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:15,682
I watched you.

652
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:18,962
What else could I do? He came here
asking questions.

653
00:45:18,962 --> 00:45:20,922
I've only two things to say to you.

654
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:23,562
Firstly, you're paid to take good
care of our property.

655
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:27,042
Ah...I do take good care of it.

656
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:30,242
Secondly...when we reopen
next season,

657
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:32,842
your services may no longer
be required.

658
00:46:05,122 --> 00:46:07,242
Here you go, sir.

659
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:08,962
One bodkin.

660
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,522
Could have belonged to the victim.

661
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:14,882
It's the sort of tool he'd use.

662
00:46:14,882 --> 00:46:16,522
But why keep it with him?

663
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:18,562
Maybe you should ask the sister.

664
00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:20,722
She uses them too.

665
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:22,482
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

666
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:35,082
If someone worked here long
enough...

667
00:46:35,082 --> 00:46:37,482
do you think they could go
slightly deranged?

668
00:46:39,282 --> 00:46:42,442
This was dumped on the Compton
sisters last night.

669
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:44,362
Freaked them out.

670
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:47,242
And that feller, Moss.

671
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:50,322
He was talking to it
like it was real.

672
00:47:23,362 --> 00:47:25,762
If you get on board, I'll drive you
there.

673
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:28,482
I'm not getting towed through
the streets.

674
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:32,042
I'm supposed to be the Queen
of the Nile. Remember?

675
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:34,322
How could I forget?

676
00:47:36,362 --> 00:47:37,922
Hi, Trev.

677
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,962
You look fantastic.

678
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:41,842
Ohh! Thank you.

679
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,562
We'll walk.

680
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:13,202
I was thinking you look stupid
enough, but you should see what your
friend Kate's wearing.

681
00:48:14,002 --> 00:48:15,922
She's not exactly...my friend.

682
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:18,402
Makes her look even more of a slag.

683
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:21,122
Still...I expect that appeals
to you.

684
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:17,606
Tom.

685
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,726
Has it changed much since your
last visit?

686
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:21,006
No!

687
00:49:21,006 --> 00:49:22,886
It's as crazy as ever,

688
00:49:22,886 --> 00:49:27,046
Would the Vikings take to their
vessel, please?

689
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:34,166
Why is it that the British love
dressing up

690
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,046
at the slightest opportunity?

691
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:40,246
Because we lead such drab lives
for the rest of the time.

692
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:44,166
HILARY: And the Wind in the Willows,
please!

693
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,806
You know, someone with your
reputation shouldn't be in charge of
kids.

694
00:50:05,806 --> 00:50:07,126
You're poisonous.

695
00:50:07,126 --> 00:50:09,886
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about my brother,

696
00:50:09,886 --> 00:50:12,646
and the way you've maligned him ever
since he got rid of you.

697
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:15,406
Well, that's not really the kind of
thing I need to hear now.

698
00:50:15,406 --> 00:50:17,806
You made it very bad for him,
do you realise that?

699
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,886
Then you should have made a better
job of tying him to your apron
strings, shouldn't you?

700
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:24,166
because that must have been the way
you liked it.

701
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:26,006
Used to make me wonder about
you two.

702
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:29,446
Well, perhaps you'd better spread
that round the village as well.

703
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:35,686
Hello, Ben.

704
00:50:35,686 --> 00:50:37,046
Mrs Barnaby. Sir.

705
00:50:37,046 --> 00:50:38,526
Hey.

706
00:50:38,526 --> 00:50:40,246
I'm surprised you're not
taking part.

707
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,286
In this weather? Nooo!

708
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:45,006
Quick, Edward, quick! Come and look
at this.

709
00:50:47,286 --> 00:50:49,366
Come on, Christa, you can do it.

710
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:51,086
I just know you're going to win.

711
00:50:51,086 --> 00:50:52,926
I'll be cheering for you
all the way.

712
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:54,806
Oh, for God's sake, leave me alone,
will you?

713
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:12,646
I'll remind you of the rules.

714
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:18,446
The first fully manned vessel to
reach the far side of the lake,

715
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:23,006
in a straight line, is the winner!

716
00:51:24,286 --> 00:51:26,206
And good luck to everyone.

717
00:52:38,486 --> 00:52:40,406
Whoa! Hold on.

718
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:57,766
You know, I think it's the people
who are crazy, not the boats.

719
00:52:57,766 --> 00:52:59,006
You're right.

720
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:06,806
Ahhh! No!

721
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:11,246
Let's see the finish. Look, we can
go over the bridge.

722
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:12,966
It's the long way round, that.

723
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:14,926
Come on, Ben.

724
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:31,406
It's not far, I don't think.

725
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:28,206
I'd say that one blow with this
thing would be enough.

726
00:54:30,886 --> 00:54:32,806
At any rate...

727
00:54:34,206 --> 00:54:36,526
one of the tines entered her heart
at an angle.

728
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:38,406
She'd have died instantly.

729
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:41,806
Tom, why so sharp?

730
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:45,246
It's not as if it was designed for
mortal combat.

731
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:48,206
Or was it?

732
00:55:04,686 --> 00:55:06,806
What is it, Hilary?

733
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:08,686
What's wrong with you?

734
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:37,406
How could such a thing happen?

735
00:55:37,406 --> 00:55:38,806
It's OK.

736
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:42,246
Whoever did it could have killed
more people.

737
00:55:42,566 --> 00:55:45,006
I was alone there before I saw you.

738
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:47,446
I could have been attacked.
But you weren't.

739
00:55:47,446 --> 00:55:49,326
So...just stop thinking about it.

740
00:56:13,046 --> 00:56:14,966
Who'd fancy you now?

741
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:27,166
Mr Johnson.

742
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:31,406
Now, sir...you see what it was that
killed her, can't you?

743
00:56:34,606 --> 00:56:36,686
Please. No, no, no.

744
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:39,206
Not me.
Why not, Mr Johnson?

745
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:41,526
King Neptune with a taste for
the ladies.

746
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:44,686
It was your party piece. Your murder
weapon.

747
00:56:44,686 --> 00:56:48,046
Yeah, but...but I already told you
that I lost it when we collided.

748
00:56:48,046 --> 00:56:50,486
Who was near you at the time?

749
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:51,926
I don't know! I mean...

750
00:56:51,926 --> 00:56:53,806
You know, it was chaos.

751
00:56:55,406 --> 00:56:57,406
I mean, young Christa.

752
00:56:57,406 --> 00:56:59,326
Why would I want to harm her?

753
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:02,766
The trident.

754
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:04,606
Where'd you get it from?
Who made that?

755
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:06,286
Jackie, in the craft shop.

756
00:57:06,286 --> 00:57:08,166
She made it for me.

757
00:57:09,006 --> 00:57:11,206
OK, Mr Johnson, you can go,

758
00:57:11,206 --> 00:57:14,606
but whatever you do...
do not leave the village.

759
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:16,486
Thank you.

760
00:57:32,126 --> 00:57:36,086
Even to this day, I fail to
understand your relationship with
the Good Lord.

761
00:57:36,526 --> 00:57:38,566
If it lives, criticise it,

762
00:57:38,566 --> 00:57:40,446
if it dies, pray for it.

763
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:44,206
It seems to be your only pleasure
in life.

764
00:57:44,646 --> 00:57:46,966
And I suppose you've nothing
to pray for?

765
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:48,846
Think back, Hilary.

766
00:57:50,206 --> 00:57:52,126
If you dare.

767
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:01,766
Why would someone want
to kill that kid?

768
00:58:03,006 --> 00:58:06,046
Well, she was with Richard Tanner
the night he died.

769
00:58:06,046 --> 00:58:08,446
Maybe the killer saw her as some kind
of witness.

770
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:12,526
I'm checking out Tanner's place later
on today. Can you meet me there?

771
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:14,006
Right.

772
00:58:14,646 --> 00:58:16,526
You see, Jones.

773
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:20,006
You look at this, you'd think you're
in some kind of rural paradise.

774
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:23,166
And how wrong you'd be.

775
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:37,926
It's all right, Robert.
You can smoke.

776
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:55,606
I don't suppose there'll ever be
another race, not now.

777
00:59:01,286 --> 00:59:04,086
Because Little Worthy will never be
the same.

778
00:59:06,886 --> 00:59:09,926
And you looked so pretty standing by
the lake today.

779
00:59:15,046 --> 00:59:16,926
Thank you, Robert.

780
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:28,246
Such a dreadful thing to happen.
Such a waste of a young life.

781
00:59:32,326 --> 00:59:36,846
We get to an age where we hope to
forget all the bad and the sad
things of the past.

782
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:39,486
But the reality is that nothing ever
goes away.

783
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,686
There's always new things to haunt
us, to worry us.

784
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:48,686
I remember...

785
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:50,966
one time that wasn't so sad.

786
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:00,966
Didn't last long, though, did it?

787
01:00:20,065 --> 01:00:21,985
Hello!

788
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:25,385
Hello.

789
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:45,897
Mr Palfrey, um...

790
01:00:46,497 --> 01:00:50,017
I can't tell you how very sorry I am
about Christa's death.

791
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:52,737
I have a daughter myself and I...

792
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:57,657
I know this will be of...small
consolation to you,

793
01:00:57,657 --> 01:01:00,857
but we are determined to find the
person responsible for this.

794
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:06,337
When I first heard the news,
I thought it was an accident.

795
01:01:09,377 --> 01:01:11,737
That would have been bad enough
to cope with.

796
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:14,337
But to learn that she'd
been...murdered.

797
01:01:16,217 --> 01:01:18,137
But why?!

798
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:20,537
Who would want to kill her?

799
01:01:28,377 --> 01:01:30,617
She was four years old
when my wife left us.

800
01:01:33,697 --> 01:01:35,617
I've looked after her ever since.

801
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:40,377
Anne Marie.

802
01:01:41,017 --> 01:01:42,897
My wife.

803
01:01:44,457 --> 01:01:46,697
She went off with the rep
from the brewery.

804
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:51,377
I could never understand why she'd
do such a thing.

805
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:54,817
But...

806
01:01:55,697 --> 01:01:57,617
at least I have Bernice.

807
01:01:58,657 --> 01:02:00,617
I couldn't have managed without her.

808
01:02:03,777 --> 01:02:05,857
I advertised for...

809
01:02:05,857 --> 01:02:07,857
help here at the hotel.

810
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:09,817
She applied.

811
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:15,857
And I'm convinced that Christa
was beginning to accept her
at long last.

812
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,057
Mr Palfrey...

813
01:02:20,057 --> 01:02:23,257
Mr Palfrey...do you mind if I took
a look at..

814
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:25,017
Christa's room?

815
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:26,897
It may help with our investigation.

816
01:02:28,417 --> 01:02:30,337
Thank you.

817
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:07,017
Not exactly house-proud
was Richard Tanner.

818
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:08,297
Hmm-mm!

819
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,497
This man...

820
01:04:16,497 --> 01:04:18,457
and Christa.

821
01:04:18,457 --> 01:04:21,697
There's got to be something else
that links them.

822
01:04:22,857 --> 01:04:24,657
Keep going back to the model village.

823
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:26,577
Why, why...?

824
01:04:26,977 --> 01:04:29,017
They were there together.

825
01:04:29,017 --> 01:04:30,737
Yes...

826
01:04:30,737 --> 01:04:33,657
I somehow feel...there's more
to that place.

827
01:04:33,657 --> 01:04:35,577
Now why do I feel that?

828
01:04:41,817 --> 01:04:43,377
Sir.
Hmm?

829
01:04:50,697 --> 01:04:54,137
Now that's the sort of stuff you'd
get at the craft shop, isn't it?

830
01:04:56,857 --> 01:04:58,697
Miss Tanner.
I, um...

831
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:02,657
I decided it was time
to come round and...

832
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,897
straighten the place up.

833
01:05:04,897 --> 01:05:06,737
The least I could do for my brother.

834
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,617
Miss Tanner...

835
01:05:12,737 --> 01:05:16,257
We realise this is the sort of stuff
you use at your craft shop,

836
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:18,337
but do you ever sell any of this
on at all?

837
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,217
Yes.

838
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,377
To Mike Johnson.

839
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,217
He needed to use the pegs
on his boat.

840
01:05:26,977 --> 01:05:30,777
They should have stopped that stupid
race years ago. Now look what's
happened.

841
01:05:30,777 --> 01:05:33,217
We were told you talked to the
schoolteacher.

842
01:05:33,217 --> 01:05:34,537
It...

843
01:05:34,537 --> 01:05:36,697
didn't sound like a very happy
conversation.

844
01:05:36,697 --> 01:05:38,777
Oh, that's because I can't stand
the cow.

845
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:43,377
You made the trident for Mike
Johnson.

846
01:05:44,337 --> 01:05:46,737
Why were the points so sharp?

847
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:49,177
That's how he wanted them.

848
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,577
Mr Moss!

849
01:06:31,177 --> 01:06:34,017
I have to remind you, sir, this is
still a crime scene.

850
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:36,097
It's still out of bounds.

851
01:06:36,097 --> 01:06:38,737
Sorry. Old habits.

852
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:42,377
I'm used to making sure all's well
before it gets dark.

853
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:44,257
Out you go.

854
01:06:47,857 --> 01:06:49,897
Mr Moss, Bernice...

855
01:06:49,897 --> 01:06:51,817
from the hotel.

856
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,337
You a good friend of hers?

857
01:06:54,337 --> 01:06:56,457
Well, not really, no.

858
01:06:56,457 --> 01:06:59,217
Only I saw the pair of you down by
the lake today.

859
01:06:59,897 --> 01:07:03,177
And she gave you more than a friendly
peck on the cheek, didn't she?

860
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:06,617
Hah! Ah, she's a daft young thing.

861
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,697
She'd kiss just about anyone
if she was happy.

862
01:07:10,577 --> 01:07:13,537
She's always like a kid at a party.

863
01:07:13,537 --> 01:07:15,737
Mmm.

864
01:07:15,737 --> 01:07:19,137
That...wasn't much of a party today,
was it?

865
01:07:19,777 --> 01:07:21,697
No, it was not.

866
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:32,017
Er...just before you go, Mr Moss.

867
01:07:32,977 --> 01:07:35,737
Your employers, the Compton
sisters...

868
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:38,777
It's a very impressive house they
have, isn't it?

869
01:07:38,777 --> 01:07:40,737
Ohh, yes. A fine old place.

870
01:07:40,737 --> 01:07:42,097
It is.

871
01:07:42,097 --> 01:07:45,097
I saw some...graves when I was
over there.

872
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:47,017
You know...little graves.

873
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:49,337
Do they keep pets?

874
01:07:49,337 --> 01:07:51,377
No, no.

875
01:07:51,377 --> 01:07:53,257
No, they got no time for animals.

876
01:07:55,017 --> 01:07:57,017
Good night.

877
01:07:57,737 --> 01:07:59,657
Edward.

878
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:09,017
Edward.

879
01:08:11,977 --> 01:08:13,937
Edward.

880
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:21,897
There you are.

881
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,817
Edward, there's no need to be
doing that.

882
01:08:30,817 --> 01:08:32,777
They have to be done.

883
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:34,697
Yes, but not at this time of night.

884
01:08:39,977 --> 01:08:41,897
Christa's room...

885
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:45,377
I've decided I want it to be left
exactly as it is, untouched.

886
01:08:45,377 --> 01:08:47,297
As though she never went away.

887
01:08:48,817 --> 01:08:52,017
And even after the funeral,
I'd like it to stay like that.

888
01:08:52,017 --> 01:08:53,897
As though she's still with us.

889
01:08:54,937 --> 01:08:56,817
We owe it to her memory.

890
01:08:58,617 --> 01:09:01,737
You still have me, Edward.
You must never forget that.

891
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,137
I won't.

892
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:05,337
We were meant to be together.

893
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:07,777
You asked for help, remember?
And I came here to you.

894
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:09,377
That was fate.

895
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:11,817
I was meant to be with you always.

896
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:14,617
Forever and ever.

897
01:09:23,017 --> 01:09:25,057
I'm going up, Tom.

898
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:26,817
All right, love. I won't be long.

899
01:09:28,217 --> 01:09:31,777
I don't suppose the people of Little
Worthy will ever get over this.

900
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:33,457
Oooh-ooh.

901
01:09:39,377 --> 01:09:41,297
What's this?

902
01:09:42,377 --> 01:09:44,497
Are you starting your second
childhood?

903
01:09:45,697 --> 01:09:47,337
Mmmm.

904
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:46,098
Oh, hi. Bernice.

905
01:10:46,098 --> 01:10:48,258
Look, um...

906
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:50,978
I just want to say that I'm really
sorry about Christa.

907
01:10:50,978 --> 01:10:54,378
I just wish, you know, there was
something I could have done,

908
01:10:54,378 --> 01:10:56,258
some way I could have saved her.

909
01:10:59,578 --> 01:11:01,258
Oh, no.

910
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:02,578
Not again.

911
01:11:02,578 --> 01:11:04,058
I've got to go.

912
01:11:09,538 --> 01:11:11,458
Mr Johnson.

913
01:11:11,898 --> 01:11:13,818
Another quick word.

914
01:11:15,178 --> 01:11:17,058
Inside.

915
01:11:27,418 --> 01:11:29,618
So what have I done this time?

916
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,618
It's about the trident you had made,
sir.

917
01:11:32,098 --> 01:11:34,218
That was just a bit of a laugh.

918
01:11:34,218 --> 01:11:35,898
Bit of a laugh, was it?

919
01:11:35,898 --> 01:11:37,538
That thing was lethal.

920
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:39,538
It was used to kill someone.

921
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:41,418
How was I supposed to know that?

922
01:11:41,418 --> 01:11:43,498
Why was it so sharp?

923
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:45,418
Because that's the way they're made.

924
01:11:45,418 --> 01:11:47,498
No, sir, that's the way you wanted it
made.

925
01:11:49,618 --> 01:11:53,298
Well...I thought it might come in
handy for some...you know, sort of
future use.

926
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,058
Doing what?

927
01:11:56,058 --> 01:11:58,178
I don't know. Um...

928
01:11:58,178 --> 01:12:00,178
Picking up litter.

929
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:02,058
Mr Johnson.

930
01:12:03,258 --> 01:12:07,498
You were given some of these by
Jackie Tanner, were you not?

931
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:09,898
That's right. I used them to secure
the boat.

932
01:12:09,898 --> 01:12:12,778
Do you ever go...to the model village
at night?

933
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:15,218
Me? No!

934
01:12:15,218 --> 01:12:17,338
I wouldn't go there during broad
daylight.

935
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:20,538
Because some of these were found with
the body of Richard Tanner.

936
01:12:21,218 --> 01:12:23,578
Well...maybe they went missing.

937
01:12:23,578 --> 01:12:25,178
From where?

938
01:12:26,498 --> 01:12:29,018
The craft shop, maybe. I don't know.
My garage.

939
01:12:29,338 --> 01:12:33,618
All right, Mr Johnson. What I said
previously still applies.

940
01:12:33,618 --> 01:12:35,698
Do not leave the village
any time soon.

941
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:37,618
Thank you.

942
01:12:38,338 --> 01:12:40,258
Mrs Johnson.

943
01:12:43,578 --> 01:12:45,658
Fantastic.

944
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:49,498
All I was doing was having a bit of
fun on the lake, and now I'm under
house arrest.

945
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:52,058
Yeah, you're always having a 'bit of
fun', Mike.

946
01:12:52,058 --> 01:12:54,098
That's the problem.

947
01:12:54,098 --> 01:12:56,018
Now, it's my turn.

948
01:13:20,338 --> 01:13:22,218
Thank you.

949
01:13:23,578 --> 01:13:25,498
Inspector.

950
01:13:27,338 --> 01:13:29,898
I wasn't sure who suggested
Gulliver's Travels

951
01:13:29,898 --> 01:13:31,818
for our theme painting week.

952
01:13:31,818 --> 01:13:33,658
I was right.

953
01:13:33,658 --> 01:13:35,538
It was Edward Palfrey.

954
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,378
Ah. Mr Palfrey.

955
01:14:13,338 --> 01:14:17,218
I'm sorry to bother you again, but
there's something I forgot to ask you.

956
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:19,378
When I saw you yesterday at the lake,

957
01:14:19,378 --> 01:14:22,458
you were leaving before the race
had finished.

958
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:25,418
That's right.

959
01:14:25,418 --> 01:14:27,338
Someone had to look after the hotel.

960
01:14:29,938 --> 01:14:32,018
Why are you asking me this?

961
01:14:32,018 --> 01:14:34,018
Well, I have to ask the same question

962
01:14:34,018 --> 01:14:36,098
of everyone who was at the race,
you know.

963
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:40,058
And I would also like to ask you
about the nursery school.

964
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,538
The what?

965
01:14:41,538 --> 01:14:44,418
The nursery school, and the choice of
Gulliver's Travels

966
01:14:44,418 --> 01:14:46,298
as a painting theme.

967
01:14:47,898 --> 01:14:49,778
Oh, I thought of that, Mr Barnaby.

968
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:52,578
It's one of my favourite books.

969
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:58,258
And I suggested it to Edward,
didn't I?

970
01:14:58,258 --> 01:15:00,138
And he told Rebecca.

971
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:02,698
Look what I've found.

972
01:15:07,898 --> 01:15:09,818
Aren't they beautiful?

973
01:15:11,738 --> 01:15:13,698
And this is so realistic.

974
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:19,618
I thought they'd help us to remember
dear Christa.

975
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:26,418
Thank you.

976
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:35,458
Just...as a matter of interest,
Mr Palfrey?

977
01:15:36,418 --> 01:15:39,938
How long has it been since...Bernice
answered your ad?

978
01:15:41,618 --> 01:15:43,538
Ah...just over four years.

979
01:15:44,338 --> 01:15:46,218
She must be a godsend to you.

980
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:49,138
Where was she before?

981
01:15:49,138 --> 01:15:52,258
The other side of Causton. A little
village called Goodman's Land.

982
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:54,378
Did she do similar work over there?

983
01:15:54,378 --> 01:15:56,018
No, she was adopted, you know.

984
01:15:56,698 --> 01:16:00,098
And she was looking after her
adoptive mother until she died.

985
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:03,738
This was the first job
she applied for.

986
01:16:03,738 --> 01:16:05,498
Hmm.

987
01:16:05,498 --> 01:16:06,898
Excuse me.

988
01:16:07,378 --> 01:16:08,858
Barnaby.

989
01:16:46,898 --> 01:16:48,818
Jones.

990
01:17:11,978 --> 01:17:13,898
Her sister found her.

991
01:17:15,538 --> 01:17:19,018
Said she saw Moss running out of
here so she came to see what was
going on.

992
01:17:19,018 --> 01:17:20,618
Where is she now?

993
01:17:20,618 --> 01:17:22,458
In the house.

994
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:24,418
Stephens, get over there.
Stay with her.

995
01:17:24,418 --> 01:17:26,018
Yes, sir.

996
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:29,858
Bernice.

997
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:37,538
Bernice.

998
01:17:50,338 --> 01:17:51,538
Bernice!

999
01:17:53,898 --> 01:17:55,618
Bernice!

1000
01:18:02,898 --> 01:18:04,818
You better stay where you are.

1001
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:07,778
I killed her...

1002
01:18:07,778 --> 01:18:09,658
I might just as well kill you!

1003
01:18:10,058 --> 01:18:12,258
And Christa?

1004
01:18:12,258 --> 01:18:14,418
And Richard Tanner,
did you kill them too?

1005
01:18:15,818 --> 01:18:17,458
Mr Moss, you're under arrest.

1006
01:18:18,538 --> 01:18:20,618
You do not have to say anything -
No, no.

1007
01:18:21,418 --> 01:18:22,978
He didn't do it.

1008
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,258
What?

1009
01:18:25,258 --> 01:18:27,218
Did you, Mr Moss?

1010
01:18:27,218 --> 01:18:29,578
This is not going to work.

1011
01:18:39,538 --> 01:18:42,258
Now, Mr Moss, you're going to take
a little walk with us.

1012
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:46,258
Bernice!

1013
01:19:23,378 --> 01:19:26,138
Did you...create this burial ground,
sir?

1014
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:29,018
Hmm?

1015
01:19:30,178 --> 01:19:32,178
And the Compton sisters didn't mind?

1016
01:19:33,098 --> 01:19:34,938
Hilary let me do it, but not
Harriet.

1017
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:38,018
She was against it.

1018
01:19:39,138 --> 01:19:41,618
But it's not a pet cemetery, is it?

1019
01:19:42,258 --> 01:19:44,178
You've more or less told us that.

1020
01:19:45,378 --> 01:19:51,018
I'd say it's the last resting place
of some of those...miniature figures of yours.

1021
01:19:51,978 --> 01:19:54,018
Am I right?

1022
01:19:54,018 --> 01:19:55,378
Yeah.

1023
01:20:02,138 --> 01:20:05,338
Surely no-one in his right mind
makes a cemetery for toys?

1024
01:20:05,338 --> 01:20:07,258
Oh, yes.

1025
01:20:07,858 --> 01:20:11,018
A father with a daughter might.

1026
01:20:13,578 --> 01:20:15,858
A daughter who shares his love for...

1027
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:18,218
the little village and the little
people in it.

1028
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:22,258
A child, who remains a child,

1029
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:24,138
even after all these years.

1030
01:20:26,418 --> 01:20:28,538
What happened to her when she was
born?

1031
01:20:28,538 --> 01:20:30,418
Was she taken into care?

1032
01:20:32,378 --> 01:20:34,498
And after that, what, adopted?

1033
01:20:34,498 --> 01:20:36,618
Yes.

1034
01:20:36,618 --> 01:20:40,298
But when she was a grown woman, you
managed to make contact with her.

1035
01:20:40,298 --> 01:20:42,018
Didn't you?

1036
01:20:42,018 --> 01:20:44,058
Brought her back to Little Worthy,

1037
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:45,978
fixed her up with a job.

1038
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:51,738
And I'm sure you told her not to let
anyone know that you were her father,
didn't you?

1039
01:20:53,778 --> 01:20:55,738
But what about her mother, Bob?

1040
01:21:00,018 --> 01:21:01,938
Did you tell her who she was?

1041
01:21:05,658 --> 01:21:07,538
No.

1042
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:44,642
I'd been married less than a year
when my husband died.

1043
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:52,882
And I truly believed that my
marriage vows were promises made to God.

1044
01:21:57,442 --> 01:21:59,322
I succumbed to sin.

1045
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:03,482
Just the once.

1046
01:22:04,842 --> 01:22:06,722
With...Robert Moss.

1047
01:22:12,482 --> 01:22:14,362
Did your sister know about this?

1048
01:22:18,762 --> 01:22:20,642
She never allowed me to forget it.

1049
01:22:24,602 --> 01:22:29,602
Over the years, I always wondered
about...my baby daughter.

1050
01:22:32,682 --> 01:22:34,602
What became of her.

1051
01:22:43,002 --> 01:22:44,882
Miss Compton...

1052
01:22:45,202 --> 01:22:47,122
Those...gravestones...

1053
01:22:47,642 --> 01:22:49,362
out in the garden.

1054
01:22:49,362 --> 01:22:51,282
Who used to look after those?

1055
01:22:51,962 --> 01:22:53,882
Robert, of course. Why?

1056
01:22:56,362 --> 01:22:58,242
It was just his way.

1057
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:02,402
Sometimes he used to see them
as real people.

1058
01:23:07,322 --> 01:23:09,242
For some reason...

1059
01:23:11,402 --> 01:23:14,962
Harriet always HATED those graves.

1060
01:23:18,762 --> 01:23:20,682
Did she know something I didn't?

1061
01:23:25,002 --> 01:23:26,882
Oh, Harriet!

1062
01:23:28,922 --> 01:23:31,202
I hope you're at peace now.

1063
01:23:33,762 --> 01:23:35,682
Sir.

1064
01:23:38,522 --> 01:23:40,482
Miss Compton.

1065
01:23:42,322 --> 01:23:44,882
I think you should have a word with
Robert Moss.

1066
01:24:35,842 --> 01:24:38,122
Thank you for notifying us,
Mr Palfrey.

1067
01:24:38,122 --> 01:24:40,002
It's not an easy thing for you to do.

1068
01:24:43,122 --> 01:24:45,042
She hasn't taken anything with her.

1069
01:24:53,962 --> 01:24:55,602
What's this?

1070
01:24:55,602 --> 01:24:57,162
It's for things she collects.

1071
01:25:14,682 --> 01:25:16,802
Um...I'd say that's from
the gift shop.

1072
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:21,842
Tea rooms.

1073
01:25:38,402 --> 01:25:40,602
Wherever she is, Mr Barnaby,
she's alone.

1074
01:25:41,242 --> 01:25:43,202
And frightened.

1075
01:25:44,962 --> 01:25:47,122
And I don't want any harm
to come to her.

1076
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:48,802
No.

1077
01:25:48,802 --> 01:25:50,802
Don't you worry, Mr Palfrey.

1078
01:25:50,802 --> 01:25:52,762
I know where to find her.

1079
01:26:26,402 --> 01:26:28,322
All right if I join you, Bernice?

1080
01:26:29,722 --> 01:26:31,642
What's the name of the pub?

1081
01:26:31,882 --> 01:26:34,082
It's The Four Bells.

1082
01:26:34,082 --> 01:26:36,442
Mr Bones used to be the landlord.
I liked him.

1083
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:38,442
Mr Bones.

1084
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:40,082
What happened to him?

1085
01:26:40,082 --> 01:26:42,082
Oh, he got old.

1086
01:26:42,082 --> 01:26:44,922
I saw his name...on a grave.

1087
01:26:47,962 --> 01:26:49,802
Do you know why I'm here, Bernice?

1088
01:26:51,762 --> 01:26:54,602
The bodkin, the trident and the
hammer.

1089
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:58,962
I'm here because of what happened
to Richard,

1090
01:26:58,962 --> 01:27:01,122
to Christa,

1091
01:27:01,122 --> 01:27:03,002
and to Harriet.

1092
01:27:04,922 --> 01:27:06,842
Do you want to talk to me about that?

1093
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,442
See, I think you should, Bernice,
because...

1094
01:27:10,442 --> 01:27:14,922
your father is quite prepared to take
the blame for all those deaths.

1095
01:27:14,922 --> 01:27:16,962
And we can't have that.

1096
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:18,442
Can we?

1097
01:27:22,402 --> 01:27:24,762
Bernice, do you know who
your real mother is?

1098
01:27:26,362 --> 01:27:28,402
Yes.

1099
01:27:28,402 --> 01:27:30,282
She left me years ago.

1100
01:27:30,522 --> 01:27:32,442
It was Harriet.

1101
01:27:45,242 --> 01:27:48,122
He shouldn't be here. He should be
outside the church.

1102
01:27:48,282 --> 01:27:50,882
Well, maybe he went a-wandering.

1103
01:27:52,722 --> 01:27:56,082
Like...a certain policeman that was
pushed through a letterbox.

1104
01:27:57,282 --> 01:27:59,402
I assume you were responsible
for that?

1105
01:28:01,602 --> 01:28:03,522
Let's get you back where you belong.

1106
01:28:04,402 --> 01:28:06,922
Bernice, what else do you know
about your mother?

1107
01:28:08,722 --> 01:28:11,162
She said my father couldn't work
here any more.

1108
01:28:11,762 --> 01:28:13,882
She wanted to take all this away
from him.

1109
01:28:14,762 --> 01:28:16,682
And you killed her because of that?

1110
01:28:18,122 --> 01:28:20,922
No, she didn't like me putting
flowers on the graves.

1111
01:28:37,842 --> 01:28:39,322
She smashed them.

1112
01:28:43,562 --> 01:28:45,442
So I smashed her.

1113
01:29:13,282 --> 01:29:15,202
That's better.

1114
01:29:15,562 --> 01:29:18,242
I saw some models like that
in Christa's room.

1115
01:29:19,282 --> 01:29:21,282
I expect you did. She stole them
from me.

1116
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:25,002
Mr Barnaby, you wouldn't believe
some of the problems

1117
01:29:25,002 --> 01:29:26,922
Edward and I had with that girl.

1118
01:29:27,522 --> 01:29:29,522
He was convinced things would
improve.

1119
01:29:29,522 --> 01:29:31,402
But you knew differently.

1120
01:29:31,402 --> 01:29:33,682
Yes, well, something had to be done
about it.

1121
01:29:52,322 --> 01:29:54,242
Come on!

1122
01:29:55,242 --> 01:29:57,162
Ohhh! Move!

1123
01:29:58,882 --> 01:30:00,802
Christa.

1124
01:30:17,962 --> 01:30:19,882
That girl was no good.

1125
01:30:21,602 --> 01:30:23,962
She was here with a man just as bad.
I saw them.

1126
01:30:30,002 --> 01:30:32,882
He had no respect for this place.
He used to abuse it.

1127
01:30:32,882 --> 01:30:34,602
So he had to be stopped.

1128
01:30:34,602 --> 01:30:35,882
Yes.

1129
01:30:36,122 --> 01:30:38,402
See you.
Call me tomorrow.

1130
01:30:59,442 --> 01:31:01,682
Anyway, he was much too big
for his boots.

1131
01:31:01,682 --> 01:31:03,602
Especially here.

1132
01:31:05,162 --> 01:31:07,362
♪ There was a tree all in the wood

1133
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:09,722
♪ The prettiest tree you ever
did see

1134
01:31:11,162 --> 01:31:14,122

in the ground

1135
