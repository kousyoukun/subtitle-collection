1
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:22,358
Hey.

2
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:27,238
On your feet, Thomas.
There's a good lad.

3
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,638
Whoops.

4
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:03,678
Go on, there's a brave lad.

5
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,998
Come on.

6
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:51,518
Yes, all right! That's enough
of that.

7
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,438
Ah, did you hear me, George?

8
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,828
What's going on?

9
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:11,918
Dunno. Saw the Compton sisters
walking past.

10
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:13,353
In a hurry.

11
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,950
Edward, what was all the noise
about?

12
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,790
It was a police car.
A police car!

13
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,630
Lunchtime menu?

14
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,000
I thought we'd have tomato and herb
soup today. It's nice and
refreshing.

15
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:55,807
This way.

16
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,840
What the hell...?

17
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
Come along. Hurry up.

18
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,790
Will you let us in, please?

19
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,670
Sorry. Can't. For goodness
sake, it's our property.

20
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,590
That may be the case, madam,
but it's now a crime scene.

21
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,240
Ridiculous...
Please, madam!

22
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,470
Morning, sir.

23
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,480
Thank you, Stephens. Thank you.

24
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,310
I said let us in!

25
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,790
Surely you know who we are!
I'm Hilary Compton.

26
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,710
We needn't explain ourselves.
This is my sister, Harriet.

27
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,830
Sir.

28
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,550
Yes, Jones.

29
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Barnaby, Causton CID. Excuse me,
please.

30
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,310
And before anyone asks, sir.

31
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,200
His name's not Gulliver.

32
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,030
What is his name?

33
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,470
Richard Tanner, sir.

34
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,830
He lives local.

35
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,190
Who found him?

36
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,000
Bob Moss. He works here.

37
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,030
Well, one thing's for sure.

38
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,990
He didn't kill himself.

39
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,160
Where's forensics?
Bullard's on the way.

40
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:07,842
All those bits of string?

41
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:08,623
STEPHENS: Stop!

42
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:09,883
He'll love this.

43
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,169
Just in case you people have
failed to realise it...

44
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:12,890
Harriet!

45
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,859
It may be the end of the season,
but we still have a business to run.

46
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
Wait!

47
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,180
Sorry, sir.

48
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,500
Right, that's enough. Let's go.

49
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,300
Please. Thank you.

50
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,700
You could have told us.

51
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,080
Guess what?

52
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,390
The police have found a body.

53
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,280
Here in the village.

54
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,360
A body?

55
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,640
Edward, that's terrible.

56
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,600
Are you having one of your jokes?

57
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,590
We heard a police car.

58
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,080
What do you mean, a body?

59
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,456
Whose body?

60
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:10,989
How do I know? Probably some poor sod
died of boredom.

61
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,910
When did you find him, Mr Moss?

62
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,910
Just after nine.

63
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,030
Did you see anyone else here?

64
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,360
No. Anyway, we don't open till 10.

65
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,659
He was trouble, but he didn't
deserve this.

66
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,630
How do you mean he was trouble?

67
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,190
Well, he used to trespass,
come in after hours.

68
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,520
Why?

69
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,470
It was his way. He didn't respect
private property.

70
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,840
Almost cost me my job.

71
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,550
Several times. Because I could not
keep him out.

72
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,640
Do you happen to know
his next of kin, sir?

73
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,990
Um...there's only his sister Jackie,
who runs the craft shop.

74
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,750
So when can I clean up
all this mess?

75
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,614
Can't leave it like this.

76
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,404
And them all covered in blood.

77
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:04,760
No, no, Mr Moss. Nothing is to be
touched.

78
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,550
And we'll need to talk to you again.
Where can we find you?

79
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,480
Well...I'll be in my workshop.

80
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,190
Looks like he received a penetrating
wound, right side, lower back.

81
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,080
So...we're looking for a weapon.

82
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,150
A knife, sharp tool.

83
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,430
Time of death?

84
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,400
We won't know until we untangle him.

85
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,550
What about the string and the pegs?

86
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,790
Yeah, it would have happened after
death.

87
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,910
I'd say he was attacked there
and dragged over here.

88
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,680
Where he could be tied up.
Yeah.

89
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,190
Some of these figures would have
been knocked over,

90
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,430
so whoever killed him must have
replaced them.

91
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,960
Yeah. Why?

92
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,470
# And on that tree
# And on that tree

93
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,150
# There was a branch

94
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,750
# The prettiest branch

95
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,550
# That you ever did see

96
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,550
# And the branch on the tree
and the tree in the hole

97
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,950
# And the hole in the ground
and the green grass grows all around
all around

98
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,400
# And the green grass grows
all around

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,990
# And on that branch

100
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,830
# And on that branch

101
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,270
# There was a...nest

102
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,310
# There was a nest

103
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,030
# The prettiest nest

104
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,910
# That you ever did see

105
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,000
# And the nest on the branch
and the branch on the tree... #

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
Not for sale, I'm afraid.

107
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,430
I bet you're glad of that.

108
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,470
Yes, well, no, it...

109
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,310
doesn't look very seaworthy.

110
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,710
That's the idea. It's for the crazy
craft race.

111
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,150
The crazy what?

112
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,910
It's an end-of-season event at
Little Worthy, sir.

113
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,880
It happens every year.

114
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,150
It's the only bit of fun we have.

115
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,030
Are you Jackie Tanner?

116
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,050
Yeah.

117
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,326
I am Detective Chief Inspector
Barnaby and this...

118
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:11,329
is Detective Constable Stephens
from Causton CID.

119
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,200
What's he done now?

120
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,484
I'm sorry. Who?

121
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:19,238
Richard. My brother.

122
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,070
Been upsetting the locals again,
has he?

123
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,090
Hmm!

124
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,009
Anyway, he'd had a couple of drinks
when he broke the windows of the
tea room.

125
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,080
But it was an accident.

126
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,350
He, er...was aiming at those naff
plastic tables they've got outside.

127
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,319
Ooh. He hates them. Well...he hates
anything that isn't real.

128
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,080
What is it? What's wrong?

129
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,550
Miss Tanner, I regret to inform you
that your brother, Richard Tanner,

130
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,440
is dead.

131
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,430
I am sorry to have to bring this news

132
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,320
to you.

133
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,520
What... What are you saying to me?

134
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,000
How can he be dead? He can't be.

135
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:14,823
How...?

136
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:19,747
His killing was unlawful. We believe
that he was murdered.

137
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,160
Please, no.

138
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,730
Not Richard.
Come on, sit down, Jackie.

139
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,070
Miss Tanner, of course...

140
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,110
I...have to ask you some questions.

141
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,893
These are very important.

142
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,773
When did you last see your brother?

143
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,640
Yesterday, maybe.

144
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
Early yesterday.

145
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
Did they kill him?

146
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,755
Who's they?

147
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:53,471
The locals.

148
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,672
Most of them hated him.

149
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,880
Did they? Why? What reason?

150
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,040
He, um...

151
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,990
He didn't want Little Worthy
changed in any way. He...

152
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,880
didn't like anything new.

153
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:12,553
So if someone suggested changes,
improvements...

154
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,399
He'd fight it.

155
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,120
Miss Tanner, where was your brother
when you last saw him?

156
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,440
That teacher...

157
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,040
Rebecca. That bitch would never
leave him alone.

158
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,418
He's my...half-brother, actually.

159
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,850
I loved him like a real brother!

160
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,800
Oh, Richard!

161
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:53,718
Where was this?

162
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,280
It was over there.

163
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
Looks as if he spent some time here
with someone last night.

164
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,486
These pegs are pretty standard.

165
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,150
They can be found in most hardware
or outdoor activity stores.

166
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,448
And the twine?

167
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:09,481
Arts and crafts shops.
Garden centres.

168
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,070
I need to move him soon, Ben, the
whole place needs to be searched.

169
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,720
We'll arrange it.

170
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,700
Don't forget the far table.

171
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,050
Please.

172
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,730
Oh, for God's sake.

173
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,090
Hardly anyone comes in here at the
best of times.

174
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,970
You know your father likes the
restaurant to be as welcoming as
possible, just in case.

175
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,156
What? With a dead body and police
everywhere?

176
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,905
Lay the table, please.

177
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,330
Would you like me to show you
how to fold a napkin

178
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,492
to make it look like a bird? I've
been learning how to do it.

179
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,152
You know your problem, don't you?

180
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,633
You've got a few of your pages
stuck together.

181
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,250
Oh, it's you!

182
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,450
I thought it was her. She doesn't
like me smoking.

183
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,370
Which one?

184
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,100
Harriet.
Oh, Harriet. Yes.

185
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,250
Is she a miss or a mrs?

186
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,720
She's always known as MISS Compton.

187
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,810
Never married.

188
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,690
Who'd want her?

189
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,690
And her sister?

190
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,610
Hilary? Yeah, she was wed once.

191
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,500
Years ago.

192
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,432
Still a young bride
when her husband died.

193
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,740
Went back to using her maiden name.

194
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,130
Still, they do all right for
themselves. I mean, they own half
the village.

195
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,850
And how long have you worked
for them?

196
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,770
40 years.

197
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,740
Not easy years either.

198
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,570
They're church people.

199
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,413
They didn't want a model pub in the
model village.

200
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,540
I had to argue until I was blue in
the face before they'd let me make
one.

201
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,856
If they had their way...

202
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,642
none of these figures would have
a smile on their face.

203
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:25,545
Mmmm.

204
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:27,436
Oh, yeah, yeah.

205
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:30,309
That's Arnold. In for a bit of a
spruce up.

206
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,580
Come on then.

207
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,170
What time did you leave here last
night, Mr Moss?

208
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,060
Ah, locked up at six.

209
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,730
Left about 6:45.

210
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,570
Home at seven.

211
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,970
And this workshop, this was locked up
too, was it?

212
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,770
Always is.

213
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,810
Do you have family, Mr Moss?

214
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,010
I never needed one.

215
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,820
Is there anyone who can confirm
what time you got home?

216
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
No.

217
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,200
Richard Tanner was stabbed some time
last night.

218
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,490
When was the last time
you saw him, sir?

219
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,770
I forget.
Ever seen him with any friends?

220
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,730
I don't think he had any.

221
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,130
Oh, come on, what about the local
schoolteacher?

222
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,322
Yeah, well...I did see him with her
once or twice.

223
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,486
Did you kill him, Mr Moss?

224
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,460
Me?!

225
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,170
Well, no, no...no.

226
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,450
No!

227
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,196
Well, you had good cause.

228
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,062
You said he almost cost you your job.

229
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:28,170
Yeah...I know, but...

230
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,290
Being out of work at your age...

231
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,180
could be difficult.

232
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:56,745
What's the matter, love?

233
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,420
Has Christa been rude to you again?

234
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,410
Just give it time.

235
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,300
Things will get better.

236
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,204
Since her mother left,
I'm all she has.

237
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:17,021
She's just a bit jealous,
that's all.

238
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,145
I couldn't be without you, Bernice.

239
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,860
Not now.

240
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,156
I couldn't bear it.

241
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,260
Miss Rix?
Yes?

242
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,300
Could I have a word, please?

243
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:39,591
I haven't seen Richard
for a couple of days.

244
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,482
Can you remember exactly when?

245
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,090
Well, I'd have to think about it.

246
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,810
Or where?

247
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,850
Oh, that's easy.

248
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,010
We went to the model village
together.

249
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,060
He wanted to get ideas
for the craft race.

250
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,116
Why are you asking me?

251
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,860
Richard Tanner's dead.

252
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,780
He's been murdered.

253
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:59,250
Moss? You spoke with Moss before
coming to see us?

254
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,850
Yes, Miss Compton.

255
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,530
That's disgraceful.

256
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,610
The man's responsible for what's
happened. He's brought it upon us.

257
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,165
All right, Harriet!

258
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,090
I'm sorry. Why - is he responsible?

259
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,170
Because he smokes while he's
working.

260
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,490
Even though we've told him not to.

261
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,010
And he insisted we open the model
village on a Sunday. I shall never
forgive him for that.

262
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,810
Get rid of him, Hilary. Get rid of
him now.

263
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,090
I can't! We need him.

264
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,937
Like we need death?

265
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,418
And blood spilled here on our
doorstep?

266
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,140
Maybe the Devil got him at last.

267
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,730
I remember him when I taught
at Sunday school.

268
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,930
In the days before...

269
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,890
Bible classes were a thing
of the past.

270
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,650
Harriet! I'm sure Mr Barnaby hasn't
come to talk about Bible class.

271
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,059
Even as a young pupil, he was always
causing disruption.

272
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,730
Well...

273
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,282
The Devil's children are renowned
for that.

274
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,700
I've nothing more to say.

275
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,460
I have things to do.

276
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,530
In many ways, Richard Tanner was
right. He simply wanted to protect
the village from change.

277
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,330
Do you think that could have been
the reason...to kill him?

278
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
No!

279
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,140
Have you got any idea who did
kill him?

280
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,500
Well...

281
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,620
No.

282
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,250
My family have lived at Little
Worthy for generations.

283
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,370
I love the place.

284
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,560
But as a tourist village,
it HAS to change.

285
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,170
Ah. Um...yes, I don't want to make
things worse for you, Miss Compton,

286
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,170
but the model village is out of
bounds to the public

287
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,290
for the time being. I'm sorry.

288
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,180
I thought it might be.

289
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,151
Do the locals know who was murdered?

290
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,720
Ah, not everyone. We haven't released
that information yet.

291
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,730
Then I wouldn't bother,
if I were you.

292
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,428
Knowing Little Worthy, they'll have
worked it out by now.

293
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,667
No!

294
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,620
No!

295
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,620
NO!

296
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:44,855
I think we should open up this room
a bit next year.

297
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,372
Put more of the tables outside.

298
00:22:47,392 --> 00:22:49,332
The person who died?

299
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,340
It was Richard Tanner.

300
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,860
He'd been stabbed to death.

301
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:58,080
That's all this village needs.

302
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,020
Who's next, I wonder?

303
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,340
(DISTANT SINGING) # And on that
branch...

304
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,260
# There was a...nest

305
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,140
# The prettiest nest

306
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,530
# That you ever did see #

307
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,260
(DOOR BANGS)
This way, sir.

308
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,380
Injured Gulliver.

309
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,050
Ah, Miss Rix, this is Detective
Chief Inspector Barnaby.

310
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,450
Miss Rix.

311
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,250
Er...I was just about to lock up.
Go home.

312
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,490
Well, perhaps you could spare us a
moment or two before you go home.

313
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:46,160
If...if it's about Richard...

314
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,770
I can't even begin to think about it
right now.

315
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,570
Look, Miss Rix...we need to catch
his killer as soon as possible.

316
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,127
And we need...all the help
we can get.

317
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,850
I've spoken to Richard's sister,
Jackie Tanner.

318
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,120
And I bet she had all sorts of nice
things to say about me.

319
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,024
Well, she did mention...

320
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,766
Well, what she actually said was...

321
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,094
'That bitch would never leave
my brother alone.'

322
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:14,778
Oh, that's great, coming from her.

323
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,280
That cow is so possessive.

324
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,660
She's the one who wouldn't
leave him alone.

325
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,486
Were you and Richard Tanner lovers?

326
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,810
We were an item once.

327
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,700
Yes.

328
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,860
What went wrong?

329
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,180
He dumped me.

330
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,267
OK, so it hurt at the time.

331
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,591
I'm...

332
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,818
I can't really handle rejection.

333
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,827
Were you with Richard Tanner
last night?

334
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,290
In the model village?

335
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,650
No!

336
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,540
I've already told him.

337
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,028
I haven't seen Richard since...

338
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,311
Now, hang on.

339
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:02,610
I may hate what he did to me, but...

340
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,650
I wouldn't hurt him.

341
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,130
I could never do that.

342
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,175
Who could?

343
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,510
Lots of people.

344
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,390
Name one.

345
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,310
Well, for a start there's
Mike Johnson, from the gift shop.

346
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,390
Richard threatened him once.

347
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,430
For what reason?

348
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,390
The randy git tried it on
with his sister.

349
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,030
God knows why.

350
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,950
Would have thought she needed
livening up.

351
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,910
Did Richard have a girlfriend?

352
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,870
Well, there's that kid from
the hotel.

353
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,590
But I'd hardly call her
a girlfriend.

354
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,030
Why?

355
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,590
Because she's too young!

356
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,080
That's why.

357
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,200
It was probably just a friendship.

358
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,220
It's a nice lot of pictures
you've got here.

359
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:45,050
Oh...yes!

360
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,234
The children.

361
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:49,260
They're great. They love their
painting.

362
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,980
Why...Gulliver?

363
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,610
We always have a theme week.

364
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,610
Someone in the village thinks
of an idea and we do it.

365
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,090
Last week, it was...the old woman
who lives in a shoe.

366
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,980
The week before that, it was...

367
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,720
Oh, something.

368
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,494
So, who...suggested Gulliver?

369
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:11,378
Ah...

370
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,950
I think it was Edward Palfrey
from the hotel.

371
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,430
Look...I really do need to get home!

372
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,590
Miss Rix...

373
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,990
How would you characterise
Richard Tanner?

374
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,830
What would you say? That he was a...

375
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,720
big man in a small world?

376
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,390
Well...

377
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,150
Yes.

378
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,040
With his way of expressing himself,

379
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,840
he certainly was too big for
Little Worthy.

380
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,190
Why do you ask?

381
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,350
Because...

382
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,640
that is how Richard Tanner
was found.

383
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,360
Tied down.

384
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:47,920
Allowed to bleed to death.

385
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:50,716
And no-one there to help him.

386
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:05,927
Today has been terrible.

387
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:07,977
All we've sold is one pair of oven
gloves.

388
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:10,697
Oh, and one joke skeleton.

389
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,789
Almost no passing trade.

390
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,417
One of the policemen bought the
skeleton.

391
00:27:17,725 --> 00:27:20,781
You could say Richard Tanner had it
coming, Kate.

392
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,821
He did upset a lot of people.

393
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,056
Upset them enough to kill him?

394
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,548
I was saying to Mike we
should have a Mystical

395
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,886
Moments grotto next season.

396
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,951
In the corner of the garden.

397
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:42,757
Some people like all that weird
stuff.

398
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,376
Where's that box of cinnamon
candles?

399
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:48,461
In the storeroom.

400
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:50,431
Well, I want them in here.

401
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:02,584
Tonight still OK?

402
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:04,111
Oh yeah.

403
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,070
On the shelf by the window.

404
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:33,810
Christa.

405
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,290
Christa!

406
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,182
Bernice has finished your sea nymph
costume.

407
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:41,511
It looks wonderful.

408
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:49,142
Christa.

409
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:52,091
We realise you're upset. But please
open the door.

410
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:55,559
Please talk to us.

411
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:57,126
Just piss off!

412
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:41,127
Can I help?

413
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,981
Yes, I'm looking for Michael Johnson.

414
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:46,231
Oh, that's me.
Ah. Afternoon, sir.

415
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:50,061
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby
from Causton CID.

416
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,991
Oh, right.

417
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,311
It's, er...it's about Richard Tanner.

418
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,392
You knew him?

419
00:29:57,412 --> 00:30:00,261
Well, of course, yeah.
Poor old Richard.

420
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,061
He was certainly part of the
village.

421
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,101
Yes, yes...

422
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:05,991
Did you like him?

423
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:07,558
No.

424
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,207
But like most people, I put up
with him.

425
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:14,460
Yeah, I understand you had a little
argument with him quite recently.

426
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,871
A what?

427
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:21,221
About his half-sister, Jackie Tanner.

428
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:23,101
Who told you that?

429
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,621
Yeah, well, did you have the argument
or not?

430
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:27,991
Well...it wasn't exactly
an argument.

431
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,811
He just told me to, er...

432
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,751
Well, leave his sister alone.

433
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,461
He didn't want her getting hurt.

434
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:37,141
And did you...leave her alone?

435
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:39,711
I wasn't exactly interested
in the first place.

436
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:44,621
Mr Johnson, would you mind telling me
where you were last night?

437
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:53,951
(Or is that a problem?)

438
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,621
Not at all. No.

439
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:58,551
Um...I went to bed about 12.

440
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:01,511
Before that?

441
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:04,057
Well, I was working late.

442
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:06,461
Building a craft for the race.

443
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:08,701
Out in the forecourt.

444
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:11,141
Er...the race can still go ahead,
can it?

445
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,661
Oh, yes, providing it doesn't
interfere with our investigations.

446
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:16,781
Yeah, it's the one village fun day.

447
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:18,774
Wouldn't want to lose that.

448
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:23,461
I'm going to be Neptune.

449
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,303
What do you think?

450
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,711
Thank you, Mr Johnson. Thank you
very much.

451
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:44,741
I'm sorry, but she still won't
open her door.

452
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:46,381
Can we help?

453
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:48,261
I believe she was seeing Richard
Tanner?

454
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,151
Seeing him?

455
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,909
Surely not. She's still only
a child.

456
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:55,741
Obviously a very upset child.

457
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:58,504
Well, only because we knew
the poor man.

458
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:01,871
He'd come here to eat and
Christa always liked to serve him.

459
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:04,581
He used to make her laugh.

460
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:05,981
Almost two of a kind.

461
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,621
In what way?

462
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:09,528
Well, let's just say that...

463
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:11,617
they're the sort who never
really fit in.

464
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,941
He used to go his own way and...

465
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:16,901
Christa's always been, well...

466
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:18,854
difficult.

467
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:21,279
But she'll grow out of it.
You always said she would.

468
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:28,021
So when was Richard last here?

469
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:31,072
Yesterday evening. He had just
a bar meal.

470
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,791
What sort of mood was he in?

471
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:36,780
His usual self, joking and stuff.

472
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,235
And Christa was in all evening?

473
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:39,261
No.

474
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:41,368
She went out later.

475
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:45,541
She's got a couple of schoolfriends.
They've been making plans about the
craft race.

476
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,225
What time did she get back?

477
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:50,451
Ah...quite late. Long after we'd
closed.

478
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:52,094
I'd gone to bed early.

479
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:54,271
Leaving me to tidy up as usual.

480
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,781
Just one wound,

481
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:01,671
but it was enough.

482
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:05,451
Penetrated the liver and the gall
bladder.

483
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:08,781
Maybe he was turning away
as the blow was struck.

484
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:10,299
Yes.

485
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:12,981
The shape of the wound is the shape
of the blade.

486
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,861
Roundish.

487
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:17,573
So the weapon you're looking for
has a blade...

488
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,351
..four to five inches in length.

489
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:24,741
With a diameter of 16mill.

490
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:26,821
Which is five eighths of an inch
in old money.

491
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,581
Like a stiletto.

492
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:30,541
How much force was used?

493
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:32,541
None was needed.

494
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:34,821
As I've said so many times before,

495
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:39,154
our creator was guilty of a few
design faults when he made human
beings.

496
00:33:39,304 --> 00:33:42,581
Vital organs too close
to the surface of the skin.

497
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:45,683
Oh, but George, he gave us a brain
to compensate.

498
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,705
That was the biggest design fault
of all.

499
00:33:57,931 --> 00:33:59,891
Christa.

500
00:34:00,091 --> 00:34:02,051
I'm so glad you've come down.

501
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:09,491
I'm going to my country dancing
class in a while if you want to come
with me?

502
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:12,711
You must be joking.

503
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:14,091
No.

504
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:18,008
I wish I knew what my dad
sees in you.

505
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:20,641
He...

506
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,241
Well, we love each other.

507
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,331
You don't even know
what that word means.

508
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:28,601
Because it's not just smiley faces
and all that happy ever after crap.

509
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:30,641
It's hell.

510
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,571
It hurts.

511
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:14,651
That's the way!

512
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:22,051
And sway.

513
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:20,053
Right, Steve, let's have you
on the floor.

514
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:23,161
But I can't dance.

515
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,131
Course you can!

516
00:36:27,971 --> 00:36:30,691
Take your partners for the
Cumberland Square Eight.

517
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,661
Mmmm!

518
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:45,171
What a sickly pong in here.

519
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,811
I don't know how you put up with it.

520
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:50,961
Do you know, I don't even notice it
any more.

521
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,851
Well, I do.

522
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:55,400
It's amazing.

523
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:58,761
You're the only man I know...

524
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,761
who smells like a poof,

525
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:03,439
and shags like a rhino.

526
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:06,961
Right.

527
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:08,611
Come here.

528
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:41,651
Well done, Steve.

529
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,811
What was that?

530
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:56,804
I didn't hear anything.

531
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,121
It sounded like the letterbox.

532
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:01,011
At this time of night?

533
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:19,448
It couldn't have been
the letterbox.

534
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,441
It must be the dustbin lids.
I told Moss to fix them.

535
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:24,401
I told you so.

536
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:26,011
Oh...

537
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:28,531
Wait.

538
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:35,161
It must have come through the door
and rolled under there.

539
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:37,131
What on earth can it be?

540
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,150
Oh, thanks, Steve.

541
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,567
Just put it down there.

542
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:07,915
I love what you've done
to this shop.

543
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:10,555
It's...

544
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,821
Well, it has such a comforting
feel to it.

545
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:16,075
Good. I'm glad you like it.

546
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:19,515
There's not much comfort in Little
Worthy at the moment.

547
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:23,091
End of a lousy season and police
all over the place.

548
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,111
Mmm.

549
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:30,465
I hope I didn't make a fool
of myself last night.

550
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,675
No, of course not. You were fine.

551
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:40,835
I'd much rather be running a shop
like this than a tea room.

552
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:43,715
Well, I'm glad someone
appreciates it.

553
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:46,687
Mike doesn't.

554
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:49,835
He says it's all a bit too fussy
for him.

555
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,915
I'm afraid he's not a buttons
and bows man.

556
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:55,547
He scares me sometimes.

557
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,567
Why?

558
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:59,115
I just don't know
what he gets up to.

559
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:06,275
It feels so good to touch,
doesn't it?

560
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:10,505
Sad, really.

561
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:13,635
I have so many glamorous things
to wear.

562
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:17,115
Exotic things,
some people might call them.

563
00:40:17,135 --> 00:40:19,162
Naughty things.

564
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:23,582
But I've no-one to wear them for.

565
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:35,955
How much do I owe you for this?

566
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,035
Oh, Detective Sergeant,
please come in.

567
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:43,671
Thank you for coming.

568
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,201
No problem.

569
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:49,025
We...we would have contacted
you last night, but it was late.

570
00:40:49,045 --> 00:40:53,145
Which means we've had to spend the
whole night worrying about it.

571
00:40:53,165 --> 00:40:54,508
Worrying about what?

572
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,528
This!

573
00:40:55,548 --> 00:40:59,824
It was put through our letterbox
last night without so much as a
by-your-leave.

574
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:04,835
See, that's the sort of person we
have to deal with in this village.

575
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:11,949
Down there.

576
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,590
Thank you.

577
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:23,075
Christa?

578
00:41:25,955 --> 00:41:27,875
I'm Tom Barnaby.

579
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:30,210
Are you a policeman?

580
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,553
Ah yes, I am.

581
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,586
But I'm not a bad person.

582
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:36,475
I love the costume.

583
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:39,685
Ah...

584
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,084
Christa.

585
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:44,834
May I...

586
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:48,275
talk to you a little bit about
Richard Tanner?

587
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:50,655
I believe he was a friend of yours?

588
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:53,455
We were more than friends.

589
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:55,815
We were lovers.

590
00:41:59,175 --> 00:42:01,405
And were you with him...the night
before last?

591
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:03,285
The night he died?

592
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:04,725
Yes.

593
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:06,765
Where was this?

594
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,525
The model village.

595
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:12,005
A strange place to meet, wasn't it?
A model village, late at night.

596
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:14,125
No. Not really.

597
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:16,125
We liked it there.

598
00:42:16,145 --> 00:42:18,055
We used to climb over the wall...

599
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:21,045
have a smoke,

600
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:23,245
make love.

601
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:27,285
He used to say the model village had
more going for it than the real one.

602
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:29,175
He was right.

603
00:42:29,735 --> 00:42:31,655
We were going to go away together.

604
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:34,135
Were you? Where to?

605
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,045
Dunno.

606
00:42:36,065 --> 00:42:37,845
Somewhere.

607
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:41,935
Christa, what time exactly did you
leave the model village that night?

608
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:45,135
Must have been just after 12.

609
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,205
Did you see anyone else there?

610
00:42:47,225 --> 00:42:48,685
No.

611
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:51,498
And didn't Richard want to leave
with you at the same time?

612
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,047
No.

613
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:55,325
He said he wanted to finish
his smoke.

614
00:42:55,345 --> 00:42:56,758
I wasn't happy about that.

615
00:42:56,778 --> 00:42:57,778
Why not?

616
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:59,966
Cos I didn't like letting him out
of my sight, that's why.

617
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,935
I hated it when he saw other women.

618
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,375
Especially that creepy teacher.

619
00:43:05,575 --> 00:43:07,857
Christa, how can you talk like this?

620
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:10,615
You just stay away from me.

621
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,845
I loved him.

622
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:13,975
All right?

623
00:43:13,995 --> 00:43:16,885
So don't go on about him being
too old for me.

624
00:43:16,905 --> 00:43:18,845
Because who are you to talk?

625
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:21,045
Bernice is half your age.

626
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,525
She cares about me and she cares
about you!

627
00:43:23,545 --> 00:43:26,975
And you only managed to pull her
because she's three tomatoes short
of a salad.

628
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,180
Look at you.

629
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:35,055
Who else would want you?

630
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,663
I'm sorry about this, Mr Barnaby.

631
00:43:45,095 --> 00:43:47,285
He was shoved through their
letterbox?

632
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:48,725
Yes.

633
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:51,255
Well...I suppose it could be kids.

634
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:53,685
Why kids?

635
00:43:53,705 --> 00:43:55,845
They sometimes nick 'em.

636
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,605
Course someone could have found him
in the street.

637
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:00,793
Decided to return him.

638
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:08,254
Now, what do you want to go
wandering off for, eh?

639
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:10,375
Ha!

640
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:12,445
Right.

641
00:44:12,465 --> 00:44:14,765
Better brush you up a bit.

642
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,125
Ah...thank you...Mr Moss.

643
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:19,525
You can have this back when we've
finished with it.

644
00:44:19,545 --> 00:44:21,415
But he belongs here!

645
00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:24,015
The Compton sisters.

646
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:27,295
Do they have anything to do with
the craft race?

647
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:29,805
Hilary does.

648
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:31,735
Not Harriet.

649
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:34,095
She hates it.

650
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:37,495
Thank you.

651
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:54,255
Oh...

652
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,055
Robert!

653
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:06,115
You were talking to the police again
behind our backs, weren't you?

654
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:07,402
Eh?

655
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:09,342
I watched you.

656
00:45:09,865 --> 00:45:12,923
What else could I do? He came here
asking questions.

657
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,085
I've only two things to say to you.

658
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:17,735
Firstly, you're paid to take good
care of our property.

659
00:45:19,015 --> 00:45:20,944
Ah...I do take good care of it.

660
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:24,405
Secondly...when we reopen
next season,

661
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:27,547
your services may no longer
be required.

662
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:01,405
Here you go, sir.

663
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,135
One bodkin.

664
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:06,695
Could have belonged to the victim.

665
00:46:06,935 --> 00:46:09,045
It's the sort of tool he'd use.

666
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:10,685
But why keep it with him?

667
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:12,725
Maybe you should ask the sister.

668
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:14,885
She uses them too.

669
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,655
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

670
00:46:27,055 --> 00:46:29,245
If someone worked here long
enough...

671
00:46:29,265 --> 00:46:31,655
do you think they could go
slightly deranged?

672
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:36,605
This was dumped on the Compton
sisters last night.

673
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:38,535
Freaked them out.

674
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:41,415
And that feller, Moss.

675
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,495
He was talking to it
like it was real.

676
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,925
If you get on board, I'll drive you
there.

677
00:47:19,945 --> 00:47:22,655
I'm not getting towed through
the streets.

678
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:26,215
I'm supposed to be the Queen
of the Nile. Remember?

679
00:47:26,575 --> 00:47:28,495
How could I forget?

680
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:32,085
Hi, Trev.

681
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:34,125
You look fantastic.

682
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:36,015
Ohh! Thank you.

683
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:38,735
We'll walk.

684
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:07,375
I was thinking you look stupid
enough, but you should see what your
friend Kate's wearing.

685
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:10,095
She's not exactly...my friend.

686
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:12,575
Makes her look even more of a slag.

687
00:48:13,255 --> 00:48:15,295
Still...I expect that appeals
to you.

688
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,567
Tom.

689
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:09,689
Has it changed much since your
last visit?

690
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:10,969
No!

691
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,849
It's as crazy as ever,

692
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:17,572
Would the Vikings take to their
vessel, please?

693
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:24,129
Why is it that the British love
dressing up

694
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:26,730
at the slightest opportunity?

695
00:49:26,979 --> 00:49:30,422
Because we lead such drab lives
for the rest of the time.

696
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:34,247
HILARY: And the Wind in the Willows,
please!

697
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:55,769
You know, someone with your
reputation shouldn't be in charge of
kids.

698
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:57,089
You're poisonous.

699
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:59,849
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about my brother,

700
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:01,536
and the way you've maligned him ever
since he got rid of you.

701
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:04,969
Well, that's not really the kind of
thing I need to hear now.

702
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:07,369
You made it very bad for him,
do you realise that?

703
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:11,449
Then you should have made a better
job of tying him to your apron
strings, shouldn't you?

704
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:13,729
because that must have been the way
you liked it.

705
00:50:13,884 --> 00:50:16,272
Used to make me wonder about
you two.

706
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,051
Well, perhaps you'd better spread
that round the village as well.

707
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,249
Hello, Ben.

708
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:26,609
Mrs Barnaby. Sir.

709
00:50:26,629 --> 00:50:28,089
Hey.

710
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,809
I'm surprised you're not
taking part.

711
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:32,537
In this weather? Nooo!

712
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,720
Quick, Edward, quick! Come and look
at this.

713
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:38,929
Come on, Christa, you can do it.

714
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:40,649
I just know you're going to win.

715
00:50:40,669 --> 00:50:42,489
I'll be cheering for you
all the way.

716
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:44,379
Oh, for God's sake, leave me alone,
will you?

717
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:02,997
I'll remind you of the rules.

718
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:08,611
The first fully manned vessel to
reach the far side of the lake,

719
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:13,666
in a straight line, is the winner!

720
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,744
And good luck to everyone.

721
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:29,979
Whoa! Hold on.

722
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:47,329
You know, I think it's the people
who are crazy, not the boats.

723
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:48,579
You're right.

724
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:56,379
Ahhh! No!

725
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:00,809
Let's see the finish. Look, we can
go over the bridge.

726
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:02,529
It's the long way round, that.

727
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:04,499
Come on, Ben.

728
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,549
It's not far, I don't think.

729
00:54:15,026 --> 00:54:18,813
I'd say that one blow with this
thing would be enough.

730
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:22,786
At any rate...

731
00:54:23,383 --> 00:54:26,089
one of the tines entered her heart
at an angle.

732
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:27,979
She'd have died instantly.

733
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:32,079
Tom, why so sharp?

734
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,519
It's not as if it was designed for
mortal combat.

735
00:54:36,832 --> 00:54:38,479
Or was it?

736
00:54:55,186 --> 00:54:57,069
What is it, Hilary?

737
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:58,860
What's wrong with you?

738
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,669
How could such a thing happen?

739
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:29,079
It's OK.

740
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,519
Whoever did it could have killed
more people.

741
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,269
I was alone there before I saw you.

742
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:37,490
I could have been attacked.
But you weren't.

743
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,952
So...just stop thinking about it.

744
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:05,394
Who'd fancy you now?

745
00:56:15,399 --> 00:56:17,429
Mr Johnson.

746
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:21,679
Now, sir...you see what it was that
killed her, can't you?

747
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:26,949
Please. No, no, no.

748
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:29,469
Not me.
Why not, Mr Johnson?

749
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,789
King Neptune with a taste for
the ladies.

750
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:34,949
It was your party piece. Your murder
weapon.

751
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:38,309
Yeah, but...but I already told you
that I lost it when we collided.

752
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:40,749
Who was near you at the time?

753
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:42,189
I don't know! I mean...

754
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:44,079
You know, it was chaos.

755
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:47,669
I mean, young Christa.

756
00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:49,599
Why would I want to harm her?

757
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:53,029
The trident.

758
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:54,869
Where'd you get it from?
Who made that?

759
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:56,549
Jackie, in the craft shop.

760
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:58,439
She made it for me.

761
00:56:59,279 --> 00:57:01,469
OK, Mr Johnson, you can go,

762
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:04,869
but whatever you do...
do not leave the village.

763
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,759
Thank you.

764
00:57:21,926 --> 00:57:26,359
Even to this day, I fail to
understand your relationship with
the Good Lord.

765
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,829
If it lives, criticise it,

766
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,719
if it dies, pray for it.

767
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:34,479
It seems to be your only pleasure
in life.

768
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:37,229
And I suppose you've nothing
to pray for?

769
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:39,119
Think back, Hilary.

770
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:42,399
If you dare.

771
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:52,039
Why would someone want
to kill that kid?

772
00:57:53,279 --> 00:57:56,309
Well, she was with Richard Tanner
the night he died.

773
00:57:56,329 --> 00:57:58,719
Maybe the killer saw her as some kind
of witness.

774
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:02,478
I'm checking out Tanner's place later
on today. Can you meet me there?

775
00:58:02,498 --> 00:58:03,559
Right.

776
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,489
You see, Jones.

777
00:58:06,509 --> 00:58:09,979
You look at this, you'd think you're
in some kind of rural paradise.

778
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:13,139
And how wrong you'd be.

779
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:28,591
It's all right, Robert.
You can smoke.

780
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:45,752
I don't suppose there'll ever be
another race, not now.

781
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:54,444
Because Little Worthy will never be
the same.

782
00:58:56,859 --> 00:59:00,319
And you looked so pretty standing by
the lake today.

783
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:06,978
Thank you, Robert.

784
00:59:14,496 --> 00:59:18,730
Such a dreadful thing to happen.
Such a waste of a young life.

785
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:26,809
We get to an age where we hope to
forget all the bad and the sad
things of the past.

786
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,679
But the reality is that nothing ever
goes away.

787
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:36,338
There's always new things to haunt
us, to worry us.

788
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:38,649
I remember...

789
00:59:38,669 --> 00:59:41,523
one time that wasn't so sad.

790
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,167
Didn't last long, though, did it?

791
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,051
Hello!

792
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:09,758
Hello.

793
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,270
Mr Palfrey, um...

794
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:34,627
I can't tell you how very sorry I am
about Christa's death.

795
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:37,110
I have a daughter myself and I...

796
01:00:38,414 --> 01:00:42,020
I know this will be of...small
consolation to you,

797
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,230
but we are determined to find the
person responsible for this.

798
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,079
When I first heard the news,
I thought it was an accident.

799
01:00:53,131 --> 01:00:55,575
That would have been bad enough
to cope with.

800
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,932
But to learn that she'd
been...murdered.

801
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,510
But why?!

802
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,910
Who would want to kill her?

803
01:01:12,511 --> 01:01:15,234
She was four years old
when my wife left us.

804
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,990
I've looked after her ever since.

805
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,750
Anne Marie.

806
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,270
My wife.

807
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,127
She went off with the rep
from the brewery.

808
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,750
I could never understand why she'd
do such a thing.

809
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,230
But...

810
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,990
at least I have Bernice.

811
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,990
I couldn't have managed without her.

812
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,686
I advertised for...

813
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,220
help here at the hotel.

814
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,190
She applied.

815
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:00,230
And I'm convinced that Christa
was beginning to accept her
at long last.

816
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,732
Mr Palfrey...

817
01:02:04,235 --> 01:02:07,387
Mr Palfrey...do you mind if I took
a look at..

818
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,380
Christa's room?

819
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,013
It may help with our investigation.

820
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,710
Thank you.

821
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,380
Not exactly house-proud
was Richard Tanner.

822
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,670
Hmm-mm!

823
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,860
This man...

824
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,820
and Christa.

825
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:06,541
There's got to be something else
that links them.

826
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,020
Keep going back to the model village.

827
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,950
Why, why...?

828
01:04:12,006 --> 01:04:13,380
They were there together.

829
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Yes...

830
01:04:14,785 --> 01:04:18,020
I somehow feel...there's more
to that place.

831
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,950
Now why do I feel that?

832
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,750
Sir.
Hmm?

833
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,510
Now that's the sort of stuff you'd
get at the craft shop, isn't it?

834
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:43,510
Miss Tanner.
I, um...

835
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:47,210
I decided it was time
to come round and...

836
01:04:47,857 --> 01:04:49,260
straighten the place up.

837
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,100
The least I could do for my brother.

838
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,990
Miss Tanner...

839
01:04:56,959 --> 01:05:00,620
We realise this is the sort of stuff
you use at your craft shop,

840
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,779
but do you ever sell any of this
on at all?

841
01:05:04,103 --> 01:05:05,427
Yes.

842
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,740
To Mike Johnson.

843
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,811
He needed to use the pegs
on his boat.

844
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:14,530
They should have stopped that stupid
race years ago. Now look what's
happened.

845
01:05:14,772 --> 01:05:17,906
We were told you talked to the
schoolteacher, and it...

846
01:05:17,926 --> 01:05:20,331
didn't sound like a very happy
conversation.

847
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:22,830
Oh, that's because I can't stand
the cow.

848
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:28,090
You made the trident for Mike
Johnson.

849
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,355
Why were the points so sharp?

850
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:33,892
That's how he wanted them.

851
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:14,950
Mr Moss!

852
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,380
I have to remind you, sir, this is
still a crime scene.

853
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,460
It's still out of bounds.

854
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,100
Sorry. Old habits.

855
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,740
I'm used to making sure all's well
before it gets dark.

856
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,630
Out you go.

857
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,260
Mr Moss, Bernice...

858
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,190
from the hotel.

859
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,700
You a good friend of hers?

860
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,820
Well, not really, no.

861
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,590
Only I saw the pair of you down by
the lake today.

862
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:47,540
And she gave you more than a friendly
peck on the cheek, didn't she?

863
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,244
Hah! Ah, she's a daft young thing.

864
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,192
She'd kiss just about anyone
if she was happy.

865
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:57,900
She's always like a kid at a party.

866
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,920
Mmm.

867
01:06:59,825 --> 01:07:03,648
That...wasn't much of a party today,
was it?

868
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,070
No, it was not.

869
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,631
Er...just before you go, Mr Moss.

870
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:20,110
Your employers, the Compton
sisters...

871
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,140
It's a very impressive house they
have, isn't it?

872
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,100
Ohh, yes. A fine old place.

873
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,460
It is.

874
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,460
I saw some...graves when I was
over there.

875
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,390
You know...little graves.

876
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,700
Do they keep pets?

877
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,740
No, no.

878
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,630
No, they got no time for animals.

879
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:40,469
Good night.

880
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:43,490
Edward.

881
01:07:51,455 --> 01:07:52,798
Edward.

882
01:07:56,902 --> 01:07:58,310
Edward.

883
01:08:04,978 --> 01:08:06,396
There you are.

884
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:15,180
Edward, there's no need to be
doing that.

885
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,140
They have to be done.

886
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,070
Yes, but not at this time of night.

887
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,270
Christa's room...

888
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:29,740
I've decided I want it to be left
exactly as it is, untouched.

889
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,670
As though she never went away.

890
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:36,380
And even after the funeral,
I'd like it to stay like that.

891
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,270
As though she's still with us.

892
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:40,456
We owe it to her memory.

893
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:46,100
You still have me, Edward.
You must never forget that.

894
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,376
I won't.

895
01:08:47,396 --> 01:08:49,260
We were meant to be together.

896
01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:52,140
You asked for help, remember?
And I came here to you.

897
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,750
That was fate.

898
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:56,190
I was meant to be with you always.

899
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,990
Forever and ever.

900
01:09:07,857 --> 01:09:09,420
I'm going up, Tom.

901
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,307
All right, love. I won't be long.

902
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:16,140
I don't suppose the people of Little
Worthy will ever get over this.

903
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,388
Oooh-ooh.

904
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:25,763
What's this?

905
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,870
Are you starting your second
childhood?

906
01:09:29,923 --> 01:09:31,023
Mmmm.

907
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:25,361
Oh, hi. Bernice.

908
01:10:25,381 --> 01:10:27,521
Look, um...

909
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:30,241
I just want to say that I'm really
sorry about Christa.

910
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:33,641
I just wish, you know, there was
something I could have done,

911
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:35,531
some way I could have saved her.

912
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:40,113
Oh, no.

913
01:10:40,133 --> 01:10:41,456
Not again.

914
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:42,743
I've got to go.

915
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,731
Mr Johnson.

916
01:10:51,171 --> 01:10:53,091
Another quick word.

917
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:55,893
Inside.

918
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:08,881
So what have I done this time?

919
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:11,207
It's about the trident you had made,
sir.

920
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:13,221
That was just a bit of a laugh.

921
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:14,826
Bit of a laugh, was it?

922
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,501
That thing was lethal.

923
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:18,501
It was used to kill someone.

924
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:20,381
How was I supposed to know that?

925
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,461
Why was it so sharp?

926
01:11:22,481 --> 01:11:24,245
Because that's the way they're made.

927
01:11:24,265 --> 01:11:26,540
No, sir, that's the way you wanted it
made.

928
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:32,271
Well...I thought it might come in
handy for some...you know, sort of
future use.

929
01:11:33,684 --> 01:11:35,021
Doing what?

930
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,141
I don't know. Um...

931
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:39,141
Picking up litter.

932
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,031
Mr Johnson.

933
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:46,739
You were given some of these by
Jackie Tanner, were you not?

934
01:11:46,759 --> 01:11:49,201
That's right. I used them to secure
the boat.

935
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:52,131
Do you ever go...to the model village
at night?

936
01:11:52,151 --> 01:11:54,181
Me? No!

937
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:56,011
I wouldn't go there during broad
daylight.

938
01:11:56,031 --> 01:12:00,171
Because some of these were found with
the body of Richard Tanner.

939
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,799
Well...maybe they went missing.

940
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,151
From where?

941
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:08,291
The craft shop, maybe. I don't know.
My garage.

942
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:12,581
All right, Mr Johnson. What I said
previously still applies.

943
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,661
Do not leave the village
any time soon.

944
01:12:14,681 --> 01:12:16,591
Thank you.

945
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:19,231
Mrs Johnson.

946
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:24,621
Fantastic.

947
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:28,461
All I was doing was having a bit of
fun on the lake, and now I'm under
house arrest.

948
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:31,021
Yeah, you're always having a 'bit of
fun', Mike.

949
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:32,589
That's the problem.

950
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,573
Now, it's my turn.

951
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:01,191
Thank you.

952
01:13:02,551 --> 01:13:04,471
Inspector.

953
01:13:06,311 --> 01:13:08,861
I wasn't sure who suggested
Gulliver's Travels

954
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:10,781
for our theme painting week.

955
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:12,621
I was right.

956
01:13:12,641 --> 01:13:14,511
It was Edward Palfrey.

957
01:13:49,755 --> 01:13:51,956
Ah. Mr Palfrey.

958
01:13:51,976 --> 01:13:56,181
I'm sorry to bother you again, but
there's something I forgot to ask you.

959
01:13:56,201 --> 01:13:58,341
When I saw you yesterday at the lake,

960
01:13:58,361 --> 01:14:02,291
you were leaving before the race
had finished.

961
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:04,381
That's right.

962
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:06,673
Someone had to look after the hotel.

963
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,981
Why are you asking me this?

964
01:14:11,001 --> 01:14:12,981
Well, I have to ask the same question

965
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:15,196
of everyone who was at the race,
you know.

966
01:14:15,216 --> 01:14:19,206
And I would also like to ask you
about the nursery school.

967
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:20,226
The what?

968
01:14:20,246 --> 01:14:23,381
The nursery school, and the choice of
Gulliver's Travels

969
01:14:23,401 --> 01:14:25,942
as a painting theme.

970
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:29,392
Oh, I thought of that, Mr Barnaby.

971
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,551
It's one of my favourite books.

972
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:37,616
And I suggested it to Edward,
didn't I?

973
01:14:37,636 --> 01:14:39,483
And he told Rebecca.

974
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,870
Look what I've found.

975
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:49,238
Aren't they beautiful?

976
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:52,279
And this is so realistic.

977
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:58,975
I thought they'd help us to remember
dear Christa.

978
01:15:03,911 --> 01:15:05,391
Thank you.

979
01:15:12,111 --> 01:15:15,071
Just...as a matter of interest,
Mr Palfrey?

980
01:15:15,091 --> 01:15:18,911
How long has it been since...Bernice
answered your ad?

981
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:23,074
Ah...just over four years.

982
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,723
She must be a godsend to you.

983
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:28,101
Where was she before?

984
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:31,221
The other side of Causton. A little
village called Goodman's Land.

985
01:15:31,241 --> 01:15:33,705
Did she do similar work over there?

986
01:15:33,725 --> 01:15:35,534
No, she was adopted, you know.

987
01:15:35,671 --> 01:15:39,993
And she was looking after her
adoptive mother until she died.

988
01:15:40,831 --> 01:15:42,701
This was the first job
she applied for.

989
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:43,721
Hmm.

990
01:15:44,823 --> 01:15:46,055
Excuse me.

991
01:15:46,351 --> 01:15:47,547
Barnaby.

992
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:27,090
Jones.

993
01:16:51,301 --> 01:16:52,871
Her sister found her.

994
01:16:54,511 --> 01:16:57,981
Said she saw Moss running out of
here so she came to see what was
going on.

995
01:16:58,001 --> 01:16:59,581
Where is she now?

996
01:16:59,601 --> 01:17:01,421
In the house.

997
01:17:01,441 --> 01:17:03,704
Stephens, get over there.
Stay with her.

998
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:04,991
Yes, sir.

999
01:17:06,911 --> 01:17:08,015
Bernice.

1000
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:16,511
Bernice.

1001
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,511
Bernice!

1002
01:17:32,972 --> 01:17:34,259
Bernice!

1003
01:17:41,871 --> 01:17:43,791
You better stay where you are.

1004
01:17:45,031 --> 01:17:46,741
I killed her...

1005
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:49,011
I might just as well kill you!

1006
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,692
And Christa?

1007
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,391
And Richard Tanner,
did you kill them too?

1008
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:57,165
Mr Moss, you're under arrest.

1009
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:59,591
You do not have to say anything -
No, no.

1010
01:18:00,932 --> 01:18:02,451
He didn't do it.

1011
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:03,991
What?

1012
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:05,950
Did you, Mr Moss?

1013
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:09,289
This is not going to work.

1014
01:18:18,988 --> 01:18:21,767
Now, Mr Moss, you're going to take
a little walk with us.

1015
01:18:23,671 --> 01:18:24,994
Bernice!

1016
01:19:02,225 --> 01:19:05,583
Did you...create this burial ground,
sir?

1017
01:19:06,031 --> 01:19:07,991
Hmm?

1018
01:19:09,151 --> 01:19:11,719
And the Compton sisters didn't mind?

1019
01:19:12,071 --> 01:19:14,629
Hilary let me do it, but not
Harriet.

1020
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:16,991
She was against it.

1021
01:19:18,111 --> 01:19:21,064
But it's not a pet cemetery, is it?

1022
01:19:21,605 --> 01:19:23,564
You've more or less told us that.

1023
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:28,151
I'd say it's the last resting
place of some of those...

1024
01:19:28,171 --> 01:19:30,558
miniature figures of yours.

1025
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:32,981
Am I right?

1026
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:34,351
Yeah.

1027
01:19:41,111 --> 01:19:44,603
Surely no-one in his right mind
makes a cemetery for toys?

1028
01:19:44,623 --> 01:19:46,231
Oh, yes.

1029
01:19:47,178 --> 01:19:50,741
A father with a daughter might.

1030
01:19:52,551 --> 01:19:54,821
A daughter who shares his love for...

1031
01:19:54,841 --> 01:19:58,108
the little village and the little
people in it.

1032
01:19:58,831 --> 01:20:01,221
A child, who remains a child,

1033
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:03,312
even after all these years.

1034
01:20:05,391 --> 01:20:07,501
What happened to her when she was
born?

1035
01:20:07,521 --> 01:20:10,102
Was she taken into care?

1036
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:13,720
And after that, what, adopted?

1037
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,803
Yes.

1038
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:19,614
But when she was a grown woman, you
managed to make contact with her.

1039
01:20:19,634 --> 01:20:20,981
Didn't you?

1040
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:23,021
Brought her back to Little Worthy,

1041
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,951
fixed her up with a job.

1042
01:20:26,231 --> 01:20:31,198
And I'm sure you told her not to let
anyone know that you were her father,
didn't you?

1043
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:35,619
But what about her mother, Bob?

1044
01:20:38,991 --> 01:20:41,159
Did you tell her who she was?

1045
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:46,511
No.

1046
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:18,502
I'd been married less than a year
when my husband died.

1047
01:21:20,915 --> 01:21:26,709
And I truly believed that my marriage
vows were promises made to God.

1048
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:33,349
I succumbed to sin.

1049
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:36,856
Just the once.

1050
01:21:37,915 --> 01:21:40,530
With...Robert Moss.

1051
01:21:45,555 --> 01:21:48,514
Did your sister know about this?

1052
01:21:51,722 --> 01:21:54,221
She never allowed me to forget it.

1053
01:21:57,675 --> 01:22:02,989
Over the years, I always wondered
about...my baby daughter.

1054
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:07,334
What became of her.

1055
01:22:16,418 --> 01:22:17,955
Miss Compton...

1056
01:22:18,275 --> 01:22:20,695
Those...gravestones...

1057
01:22:20,715 --> 01:22:22,425
out in the garden.

1058
01:22:22,445 --> 01:22:24,588
Who used to look after those?

1059
01:22:25,035 --> 01:22:27,144
Robert, of course. Why?

1060
01:22:29,435 --> 01:22:31,545
It was just his way.

1061
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:36,041
Sometimes he used to see them
as real people.

1062
01:22:40,443 --> 01:22:42,476
For some reason...

1063
01:22:44,475 --> 01:22:48,632
Harriet always HATED those graves.

1064
01:22:51,835 --> 01:22:54,302
Did she know something I didn't?

1065
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:00,196
Oh, Harriet!

1066
01:23:01,995 --> 01:23:04,878
I hope you're at peace now.

1067
01:23:07,434 --> 01:23:08,478
Sir.

1068
01:23:12,544 --> 01:23:13,757
Miss Compton.

1069
01:23:15,193 --> 01:23:18,699
I think you should have a word with
Robert Moss.

1070
01:24:08,915 --> 01:24:11,767
Thank you for notifying us,
Mr Palfrey.

1071
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,874
It's not an easy thing for you to do.

1072
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:18,594
She hasn't taken anything with her.

1073
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:28,758
What's this?

1074
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:30,643
It's for things she collects.

1075
01:24:47,598 --> 01:24:50,247
Um...I'd say that's from
the gift shop.

1076
01:24:53,437 --> 01:24:54,915
Tea rooms.

1077
01:25:11,475 --> 01:25:14,085
Wherever she is, Mr Barnaby,
she's alone.

1078
01:25:14,496 --> 01:25:16,417
And frightened.

1079
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:20,185
And I don't want any harm
to come to her.

1080
01:25:20,205 --> 01:25:21,865
No.

1081
01:25:21,885 --> 01:25:23,865
Don't you worry, Mr Palfrey.

1082
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:25,835
I know where to find her.

1083
01:25:59,775 --> 01:26:02,023
All right if I join you, Bernice?

1084
01:26:03,095 --> 01:26:05,015
What's the name of the pub?

1085
01:26:05,255 --> 01:26:07,445
It's The Four Bells.

1086
01:26:07,465 --> 01:26:09,805
Mr Bones used to be the landlord.
I liked him.

1087
01:26:09,825 --> 01:26:11,405
Mr Bones.

1088
01:26:11,825 --> 01:26:13,102
What happened to him?

1089
01:26:13,122 --> 01:26:14,650
Oh, he got old.

1090
01:26:15,465 --> 01:26:18,295
I saw his name...on a grave.

1091
01:26:21,335 --> 01:26:23,175
Do you know why I'm here, Bernice?

1092
01:26:25,135 --> 01:26:28,379
The bodkin, the trident and the
hammer.

1093
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:32,948
I'm here because of what happened
to Richard,

1094
01:26:32,968 --> 01:26:34,485
to Christa,

1095
01:26:34,505 --> 01:26:36,375
and to Harriet.

1096
01:26:38,295 --> 01:26:40,215
Do you want to talk to me about that?

1097
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:43,245
See, I think you should, Bernice,
because...

1098
01:26:43,265 --> 01:26:48,285
your father is quite prepared to take
the blame for all those deaths.

1099
01:26:48,305 --> 01:26:50,325
And we can't have that.

1100
01:26:50,345 --> 01:26:51,815
Can we?

1101
01:26:55,593 --> 01:26:58,541
Bernice, do you know who
your real mother is?

1102
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:01,152
Yes.

1103
01:27:01,785 --> 01:27:03,655
She left me years ago.

1104
01:27:03,895 --> 01:27:05,460
It was Harriet.

1105
01:27:18,615 --> 01:27:21,635
He shouldn't be here. He should be
outside the church.

1106
01:27:22,005 --> 01:27:24,784
Well, maybe he went a-wandering.

1107
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:29,455
Like...a certain policeman that was
pushed through a letterbox.

1108
01:27:30,655 --> 01:27:32,880
I assume you were responsible
for that?

1109
01:27:34,975 --> 01:27:36,895
Let's get you back where you belong.

1110
01:27:37,954 --> 01:27:40,472
Bernice, what else do you know
about your mother?

1111
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:44,688
She said my father couldn't work
here any more.

1112
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:47,255
She wanted to take all this away
from him.

1113
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:50,450
And you killed her because of that?

1114
01:27:51,495 --> 01:27:54,295
No, she didn't like me putting
flowers on the graves.

1115
01:28:11,215 --> 01:28:12,695
She smashed them.

1116
01:28:16,935 --> 01:28:18,815
So I smashed her.

1117
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:48,575
That's better.

1118
01:28:48,796 --> 01:28:52,247
I saw some models like that
in Christa's room.

1119
01:28:52,471 --> 01:28:54,747
I expect you did. She stole them
from me.

1120
01:28:55,735 --> 01:28:58,365
Mr Barnaby, you wouldn't believe
some of the problems

1121
01:28:58,385 --> 01:29:00,295
Edward and I had with that girl.

1122
01:29:00,895 --> 01:29:02,885
He was convinced things would
improve.

1123
01:29:02,905 --> 01:29:04,765
But you knew differently.

1124
01:29:04,785 --> 01:29:07,055
Yes, well, something had to be done
about it.

1125
01:29:25,695 --> 01:29:27,615
Come on!

1126
01:29:28,615 --> 01:29:30,535
Ohhh! Move!

1127
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:34,175
Christa.

1128
01:29:51,731 --> 01:29:53,633
That girl was no good.

1129
01:29:54,752 --> 01:29:58,017
She was here with a man just as bad.
I saw them.

1130
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:06,245
He had no respect for this place.
He used to abuse it.

1131
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:07,965
So he had to be stopped.

1132
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:09,255
Yes.

1133
01:30:09,495 --> 01:30:12,230
See you.
Call me tomorrow.

1134
01:30:32,815 --> 01:30:35,045
Anyway, he was much too big
for his boots.

1135
01:30:35,065 --> 01:30:36,975
Especially here.

1136
01:30:38,535 --> 01:30:40,725
# There was a tree all in the wood

1137
01:30:40,745 --> 01:30:43,095
# The prettiest tree you ever
did see

1138
01:30:44,535 --> 01:30:47,485
# The tree in the hole and the hole
in the ground

1139
01:30:47,505 --> 01:30:50,255
# And the green grass grows
all around, all around

1140
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:52,935
# And the green grass grows
all around

1141
01:30:54,095 --> 01:30:57,495
# There was a tree all in the wood

1142
01:30:58,215 --> 01:31:00,535
# The prettiest tree you ever
did see

1143
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:05,005
# The tree in the hole and the hole
in the ground

1144
01:31:05,025 --> 01:31:07,405
# And the green grass grows
all around, all around...

1145
01:31:07,425 --> 01:31:09,445
Bernice.

1146
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:13,375
Would it matter very much to you
if I told you that Harriet Compton...

1147
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:16,041
was not your real mother.

1148
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:18,405
Not now, no.

1149
01:31:18,425 --> 01:31:20,295
Too late to care.

1150
01:31:23,335 --> 01:31:26,915
Tell me about your life before you
came here, in Goodman's Land.

1151
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,535
There's not much to say.

1152
01:31:31,255 --> 01:31:34,321
# And the tree in the hole
and the hole in the ground

1153
01:31:34,563 --> 01:31:36,577
# And the green grass grows -
Well, didn't they miss you

1154
01:31:36,597 --> 01:31:38,256
when you decided to leave?

1155
01:31:39,425 --> 01:31:41,245
There was only Mary.

1156
01:31:41,265 --> 01:31:42,714
Your adoptive mother?

1157
01:31:42,734 --> 01:31:43,889
Yeah.

1158
01:31:44,486 --> 01:31:47,535
She didn't want me to go but she
died just before I left.

1159
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:50,055
What did she die of?

1160
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:54,615
Apparently she drank something
that didn't agree with her.

1161
01:32:00,095 --> 01:32:03,165
# And the green grass grows
all around, all around

1162
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:05,415
# And the green grass grows
all around

1163
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:10,152
# Now on this tree there was a limb

1164
01:32:11,095 --> 01:32:13,495
# The prettiest limb you ever
did see

1165
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:17,285
# The limb on the tree
and the tree in the hole

1166
01:32:17,305 --> 01:32:19,485
# And the hole in the ground

1167
01:32:19,505 --> 01:32:22,485
# And the green grass grows
all around, all around

1168
01:32:22,505 --> 01:32:24,855
# And the green grass grows
all around #
