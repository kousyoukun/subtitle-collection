1
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:16,064
Go on.

2
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:22,304
Out you go!

3
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:41,264
(BEEPS)

4
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:10,244
Did you put the alarm on?
Of course I did.

5
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:14,684
Did you check the back door?

6
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:16,564
Yes.

7
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:04,056
Darling...

8
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:07,896
while you're up, I think I left
my water on the dressing table.

9
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,804
Thank you, darling.

10
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:18,964
Don't I get a goodnight kiss?

11
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:26,844
Mm...come back to bed!

12
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:30,764
What are you talking about?

13
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:33,133
I am in bed!

14
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:36,124
(SCREAMS)

15
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,284
Go on, go on!

16
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:19,044
(CAR ALARM)

17
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,644
Go on!

18
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:51,244
Er, next, Freddy's birthday.

19
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,684
We'll have drinks in the Yellow Room
before dinner.

20
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,524
Tell Missus Cox beef, our beef,
as bloody as she likes.

21
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:59,044
What about Tallis?
You know she doesn't eat meat.

22
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:03,124
Well, she can eat vegetables then,
can't she?

23
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:05,164
I want Freddy on my right,
Isobel on my left,

24
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:07,124
the girls as far away from me
as possible...

25
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,044
and the rest, I leave up to you.

26
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:37,524
Race you to the Dower House!
Don't you dare.

27
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:41,524
Wuss! If she wants to break her leg
that's her business.

28
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:11,124
Go away, Rupert.

29
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:13,324
I'm not in the mood for you today.

30
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:15,404
I'll give you a back massage.
No.

31
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:18,924
Get off my bed, you're a servant.

32
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,844
It's not appropriate.

33
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,484
I love you too (!)
Be gone!

34
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:01,204
Happy birthday, Freddy!

35
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:09,204
Happy birthday, Freddy!

36
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:11,364
Hop in, meeting at 10:00.

37
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:14,004
See you at dinner, Isobel.
Jack?

38
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:16,124
Can I ask a favour?

39
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:20,084
Anything for you. David Roper
is staying for a couple of days.

40
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:22,804
Can we bring him this evening?
Oh, God...

41
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,684
Well, he is Freddy's godfather.

42
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:27,844
And you know what
happened last year.

43
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:30,964
Yes, and David was mortified.
He hasn't had a drink since.

44
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:32,844
I'll believe that when I see it.

45
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:38,604
Go on, then. Bring him if you must.

46
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,804
Oh, thanks, Jack. Really.

47
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,044
Tallis! Get that animal
out of the way!

48
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:44,964
Bye, Daddy.

49
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,724
Morning.

50
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:03,204
I'll never get used to that man
careering up and down our drive.

51
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,284
Well, it's his drive now, Mummy.

52
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:08,324
Have some breakfast.

53
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:10,524
You're the twelfth baronet, Will,

54
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:13,164
and the first not to live
at Chettham Park House.

55
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:15,764
'Adapt and survive',
that's the name of the game.

56
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:19,004
Say what you like, that man
turned us out of our home.

57
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:22,244
Saved our bacon, more like. Jack's
been a very good friend to us.

58
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,564
I'm sorry, darling. I had
such a beastly night...

59
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:29,764
Every joint in my body was on fire.

60
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,084
Get me my pills, will you?

61
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:37,324
David Roper's coming to stay.
That should cheer you up.

62
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,204
How lovely!

63
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:42,484
David will buck things up
around here.

64
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:44,324
Mm.

65
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:46,244
Not too much, I hope.

66
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:52,244
It wouldn't keep a child out,
nevermind The Creeper.

67
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:55,244
Joyce, I have told you, The Creeper

68
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:59,044
goes for big houses in the country,
stuffed with jewellery and antiques.

69
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:02,084
Not semi's in Causton with
a couple of tacky prints.

70
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:05,684
He creeps into people's bedrooms,
Tom. When they're asleep.

71
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,564
(DOOR BELL)

72
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:10,284
See? It's perfect...

73
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:12,084
Hi.
Morning.

74
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:14,084
It's absolutely fine...oh...

75
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:18,444
Address your remarks
to that young man.

76
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,844
He's supposed to be investigating
The Creeper.

77
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:26,364
Missus Barnaby would like to know
why you haven't caught him yet?

78
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:29,924
Well, she's not the only one.

79
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:32,284
What's happened?
The Chief Constable's been done.

80
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:35,604
By The Creeper?
Looks like it.

81
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:38,004
I've just come from his house,
it's like Fort Knox.

82
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:40,924
Oh, dear.
Tom! It's not funny.

83
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:45,004
No, it's not. He's got forensics
all over the place like a rash.

84
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:47,324
Everyone's sworn to secrecy,
of course.

85
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:50,124
You can imagine how paranoid
he is about security.

86
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:53,204
Yes, I can.
You're gonna love the next bit.

87
00:08:54,364 --> 00:08:56,604
There's more?

88
00:08:56,604 --> 00:09:00,524
The Chief Constable wants to see you
first thing tomorrow morning. Me?

89
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:03,044
Apparently the case requires
'the delicate touch

90
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,964
of an experienced senior officer.'

91
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:08,524
Now, that is funny.

92
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,324
ISOBEL: David, you look marvellous!

93
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,364
Doesn't he look marvellous!
Positively glowing!

94
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:44,044
Well, my body is a temple
these days.

95
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,244
Somewhat battered...

96
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:48,724
(YELLS IN EXCITEMENT)
Freddy!

97
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:51,284
Happy birthday!

98
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,564
How's capitalism?
Jack made you rich yet?

99
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:59,444
Well, you know...
Yeah...Oh!

100
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:02,164
Oh, the Lady Elizabeth!

101
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,484
Thank God you're here, David.

102
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:08,364
Now we'll have some fun. I'm as
dull as ditchwater these days.

103
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:12,244
I doubt that very much! Talking of
which, isn't it time we had a drink?

104
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,124
I'm gasping.

105
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:17,524
Mineral water, you idiots.

106
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:21,324
Come on!

107
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,684
Here you are, you lucky people.

108
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:31,724
Advance copies, personally inscribed
by the real author, ie, me.

109
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:34,724
So this is THE Harry Godbolt book
then, is it?

110
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:37,444
I've ghosted pop stars, footballers,

111
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,084
but gangsters are the vainest
of the lot, believe me.

112
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:42,164
Bit of a coup getting this,
wasn't it?

113
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:44,444
Godbolt remembered me
from the old days.

114
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,964
'The old days'? Used to gatecrash
all our parties at the gallery.

115
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,124
Ghastly man.

116
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,964
Oh, it was chic then!
To have a tame gangster in tow.

117
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:56,244
Oh, there's a great photo!

118
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,484
(HUMS)

119
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:03,244
Here. Taken at the
opening night party.

120
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,124
(LAUGHTER)

121
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,284
PHOTOGRAPHER: Thank you.

122
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,844
OK, one more. This way, this way,
darling. One more photo.

123
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:16,684
Lovely...

124
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:19,484
Isn't that like the one
in your bedroom?

125
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:22,244
Yes. Minus Godbolt, thank God.

126
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:24,684
(LAUGHS)
Probably rushed off to rob a bank.

127
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,564
Of course...the book
is complete tosh.

128
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,324
(CLEARS THROAT) He died
in the prison hospital...

129
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,804
before we got onto his first murder,
so I had to make the rest up.

130
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:38,604
Isn't it about time you wrote
a proper book, David?

131
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:41,164
Yes, and that's exactly
what I plan to do.

132
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:43,604
And...I've had an idea.

133
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,524
Clever you.

134
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:49,724
How marvellous it must be
to have an idea.

135
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:53,604
I am going to write a book about us.

136
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:56,924
About us?
Us.

137
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,124
I mean, look what happened
to our old gang.

138
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:03,364
Cabinet ministers,
artists, film stars...

139
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,324
masters of the universe!

140
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,524
Look at Jack Filby.

141
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:09,844
It didn't quite happen
for all of us, David.

142
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:14,364
Aw, you were a trailblazer, Will.

143
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:17,164
The gallery, the magazine,
the record label.

144
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,004
Which all went bust.

145
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,164
David's right, Dad.
You had the ideas,

146
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:24,364
you just didn't have the luck.
Exactly, Freddy.

147
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:26,604
Anyway, that's my idea.

148
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:31,804
An in-depth portrait of a generation
that changed the way we live.

149
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:34,964
And I am going to pitch it
at Jack tonight.

150
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:38,284
He's bought up all these publishers,
hasn't he?

151
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:41,964
Jack may not be too keen on
having the past raked up.

152
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,164
He's a public figure now, David.

153
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,044
Oh, don't worry.
I won't tread on any toes.

154
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:51,164
And anyway, Jack's always been
a bit of a maverick at heart.

155
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:53,364
I've got a good feeling about this.

156
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:56,244
This is the one that's going
to turn things around for me.

157
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,044
Well...let's hope so, David.

158
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:13,164
TALLIS: No, don't be greedy.

159
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:17,804
DOCTOR GORING: Got a brace of
partridge

160
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:20,324
in Curate's Wood this morning,
Jack. Murderer.

161
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,204
What was that, dear?

162
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:23,484
Nothing.

163
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:28,564
Laid my hands on a Picasso etching
you may be interested in, Will.

164
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:31,724
From the Vollard suite.
Ah, sorry, Hugo.

165
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,844
Totally broke, 'comme toujours.'

166
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:38,884
Erm...

167
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:43,604
How lovely it is to be here,
surrounded by one's oldest

168
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:46,164
and most trusted friends.

169
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:48,324
Freddy's birthday has become...

170
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:52,084
..a bit of a ritual, a chance
for us all to get together,

171
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:54,964
but there is a special reason
to celebrate tonight.

172
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:58,764
As you know, Freddy has been working
for me for three years now

173
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:01,764
and...he's a credit
to William and Isobel.

174
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:04,204
No, no, I have to say this...

175
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:09,084
You two did a fantastic job
in bringing that young man up.

176
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,244
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

177
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,124
Happy birthday, Freddy.

178
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:15,844
ALL: Happy birthday, Freddy!

179
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:22,164
And so...from Monday I am
giving him a seat on the board.

180
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:24,044
(APPLAUSE)

181
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,604
ALL: # For he's a jolly good fellow

182
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:30,484
# For he's a jolly good fellow

183
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:32,964
# For he's a jolly good fel-low

184
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:35,804
# And...and so say all of us! #

185
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:37,684
(APPLAUSE)

186
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:41,404
Martha. Martha...

187
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:43,364
You're drunk, get out.

188
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:53,724
With pleasure.
And put some clothes on.

189
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,604
(GLASS TINGS)

190
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:03,724
Er, I just wanted to thank
everyone for coming

191
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:06,124
and to thank Jack
for this lovely party

192
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,804
and the terrific opportunity
that he's given me.

193
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:12,564
I think that everyone
here has experienced

194
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:15,244
his incredible kindness
at one time or another.

195
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:18,124
I certainly have and
so have Mum and Dad.

196
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:20,844
So once again, thank you, Jack.

197
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:22,724
ALL: Thank you, Jack!

198
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,884
That's quite enough of
the mutual back-slapping.

199
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,564
I'm just going to say goodnight
to the horses, Daddy.

200
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:32,324
Um...coffee in the billiard room.

201
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:34,204
Cigars in the smoking room.

202
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:38,324
Come on, come on... That girl's off
her rocker if you ask me.

203
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:41,524
So's the other one.
Not surprising in the 'circs'.

204
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,404
Keep it down, Hugo.

205
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,844
Hello, Sid...

206
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:21,084
HUGO: You can break, Freddy.
OK.

207
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:22,964
Watch out.

208
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:27,644
WILLIAM: Good shot.
Think I've set you up, Hugo.

209
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:49,444
Thank you.

210
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:52,164
Can I have a word, Jack?

211
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:54,044
If you must.

212
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:01,941
I don't drink.
Shame.

213
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,755
65 years old, this one.

214
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,684
You were rather fond of brandy,
weren't you?

215
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,156
(LAUGHS)
Not anymore.

216
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,284
Absolutely not!

217
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:24,764
I invite you here, despite
what happened last year -

218
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:27,729
Listen, Jack -
Shut up! Rupert, that'll be all!

219
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:37,764
Of course, I'll be completely
discreet. Don't believe you.

220
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,884
The only reason to
write a book like that

221
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:42,004
is salacious gossip and innuendo.

222
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:44,644
No! No, Jack, this is the
portrait of a generation!

223
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:48,204
Oh, nonsense!
You are a muck-raking hack, David.

224
00:17:48,204 --> 00:17:50,444
I want nothing to do with it,
end of discussion.

225
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,964
It's a great idea, Jack!
It is pure - (INDISTINCT)

226
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:58,284
JACK: It is a terrible idea
and it is not going to happen!

227
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,524
Now, leave!

228
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,884
All right. I will take it
somewhere else, then.

229
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:09,102
(LAUGHS) Even better. I won't have
to be so discreet then, will I?

230
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,804
Out. Now.

231
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,324
That's all you really wanted,
wasn't it? A drink.

232
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:23,204
Here, take the bottle!

233
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:25,804
Ah!

234
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:29,004

Crumbs from the rich man's table!

237
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:49,284
Well, that's the only reason
we're all here, isn't it? Eh?

238
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,324
Uptight bourgeois parasites!

Despise you!

David, please!
Stay where you are.

00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:11,564
We have all done quite enough
looking after David.

246

Go tell your grandmother it's all
right. We'll get him to bed.

Won't be for the first time either.

Public confidence, Barnaby.

knowledge that The Creeper...

278

had successfully burgled
the Chief Constable's house -

There's no need to spell it out,

And I do wish that people would
stop using that ridiculous name.

None. And the alarm system
was deactivated, God knows how.

when you last looked at it?

Certainly not. Those are
the Christmas decorations.

was...in here...

He would have seen you...key
in your code.

have gained access to your house

He won't use the cat flap.

Excuse me...

304

The precise details of this
break-in should remain

strictly 'need-to-know', Barnaby.

Oh, yes. Yes, sir.

307

There's been a break-in at Chettham
Park. Looks like The Creeper again.

Yes, sir.

Only this is slightly different.

discovered a body.

BARNABY: What about the wound
on his forehead?

312
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,200
Happened sometime last night,
apparently.

313
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,000
He'd been drinking heavily,
according to the Chetthams.

314
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,440
Why don't the Chetthams
live up at the big house?

315
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
Well, they probably rent it out.

Local gossip has it that
they're somewhat skint.

317
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,080
So this is skint, is it?

318
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,480
JONES: Gentry do things differently,
eh?

319
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,120
Is there anything else missing
apart from Lady Isobel's diamonds?

320
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Some cash.

321
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,720
And Roper had a laptop, sir. It
was here when they put him to bed.

322
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,160
Tom?
Yeah...

323
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,560
Have a look at this. See?

324
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,480
Little red dots?

325
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,640
Petechiae.
Very good, Tom.

326
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,800
Now, this can happen when death's
caused by cardiac arrest, or -

327
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,200
Or asphyxiation. Yeah, but there's
no sign of strangulation.

328
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,080
Listen, George. He comes to...

329
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,880
sees The Creeper in his room...

330
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,720
starts to raise the alarm
and The Creeper shuts him up.

331
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,640
You think he was suffocated?

332
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,320
Lift his head, George.

333
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,640
Mm-hm!

334
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,960
He's smothered by the pillow.

335
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,160
Blood from the head wound...gets on
the pillow

336
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,480
but the murderer replaces
it...the clean side up.

337
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,080
Evidence.

338
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,720
Be interesting to find out
exactly how much alcohol

339
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,640
there is in his bloodstream.

340
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,520
Soon as I can, Tom.
Thank you.

341
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,600
(WHISTLES)

342
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,000
The cut on his head didn't look
at all bad once we cleaned him up.

343
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,240
And...well...not to mince words...

344
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,400
..we'd seen him much worse,
Inspector.

345
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
And when he didn't come downstairs
in the morning

346
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,960
we assumed...he was sleeping it off.

347
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,960
Where'd he been? We'd all been
at the house, Inspector.

348
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,920
It was my birthday yesterday
and Jack threw a small party.

349
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,080
Jack?
Jack Filby. He lives at the house.

350
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,440
He owns it. He owns the estate,
he owns this house and he owns us!

351
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,280
Please, Grandma...

352
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,320
Jack's an old friend, Inspector.

353
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,200
Er, my son works for him.

354
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,880
So, you'd all been to a party
at Chettham Park House,

355
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,960
but David Roper came back here
some time after the rest of you?

356
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,040
Actually...he left the party
before us.

357
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,800
I'm afraid he fell off the wagon
last night.

358
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,120
He was probably roaming the park
for a couple of hours.

359
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,360
So, the burglary took place after
you'd put Mister Roper to bed?

360
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,160
Yes.

361
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,920
I was still wearing my jewellery
when he turned up.

362
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,080
My God...

363
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,000
you don't think...he was
murdered...by the burglar?

364
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,440
In the circumstances...

365
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
I'm afraid we'll have to treat
his death as...suspicious.

366
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,080
Guess what?
We've been burgled, too!

367
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,960
Dad's incandescent...

368
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,200
What happened?

369
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,320
David's dead, Tallis.

370
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,720
Dead?

371
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,000
But I don't...I don't understand.

372
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,880
I don't understand...
It's OK, Tall...

373
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,760
(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)

374
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm sorry.

375
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,120
Hello? Right.

376
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,313
Erm...I saw...

377
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,720
a couple of copies of this book
upstairs.

378
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,640
David's latest. He was a writer.

379
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Er, it's Jack. Mister Filby.

380
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,720
He'd very much like to have a
word with you, up at the house.

381
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,440
You've been summoned, Inspector.

382
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,640
Better jump to it,
like the rest of us.

383
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,000
BARNABY: Very nice of Mister Filby
to give a party for you.

384
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,360
Hm. It's become a, sort of,
tradition over the years.

385
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,080
He was at university with Mum and
Dad, so I've known him all my life.

386
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,960
What about David Roper?
Yes, him too.

387
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,160
Actually, he's my godfather.

388
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Was.

389
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,280
Incredibly nice man.

390
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,200
A little bit difficult at times,
but...

391
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
'Difficult'?

392
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,080
Well, when he was,
you know, drinking.

393
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,080
Any particular reason he fell
off the wagon last night?

394
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,000
Not that I know of.

395
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I think he might have had a
slight altercation with Jack.

396
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,200
BARNABY: Any idea what about?

397
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,440
No, none whatsoever.
You'll have to ask Jack.

398
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,440
JACK: Here's a list of the watches,
with the serial numbers.

399
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,320
And a photograph of the etching.

400
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,320
We found a window open on
the top floor at the back.

401
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,920
So much for our state-of-the-art
security system.

402
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Would you mind showing the er,
the sergeant that window?

403
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,000
Sure. This way.

404
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,720
So tell me about David Roper.

405
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,120
Yes, sir. Erm, police officers
investigating the break-in

406
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,640
at the Dower House found
his body in the guest room.

407
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,080
It appears that he died
during the night.

408
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,720
So it finally caught up with him,
eh?

409
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,800
What's the 'it', sir?

410
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,320
Drink, drugs. Whatever.

411
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,280
You name it, David snorted it,
drank it, smoked it.

412
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,320
Sorry, Freddy, it's true.

413
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,200
I...I know.

414
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,400
Did you have a disagreement
with Mister Roper last night?

415
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,600
Did I what? I mentioned that
you and David had words.

416
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,200
Well, there was a frank exchange
of opinions, yes.

417
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,920
I've recently moved into publishing

418
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,800
and he came to me with a
hare-brained proposal for a book.

419
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,040
Looking for a hand-out, basically.

420
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,560
What kind of book was that?
Oh, it was about us,

421
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,440
the old movers and shakers, our
generation, some nonsense like that.

422
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,866
You turned him down?
Yes, I did.

423
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,520
So he grabbed a bottle
of my best brandy

424
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,400
and flounced off into the night.

425
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,340
Look...I've been bailing David out
for years now.

426
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,680
Rehab, therapy, endless loans.

427
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,640
Money down the drain.

428
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,605
Last night my patience ran out
and...

429
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,040
Now of course I feel terrible.

430
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,334
Must have got in through that.

431
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:48,278
No prints anywhere, needless to say.

432
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:50,158
Hell of a climb, though.

433
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:54,638
I'll tell you what's interesting.
It's in a blind spot.

434
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:57,518
Neither of those CCTV cameras
covers it.

435
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,798
So, The Creeper had
done his homework...

436
00:33:00,736 --> 00:33:01,862
Looks like it.

437
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:07,118
Well, we'll need names and addresses

438
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,290
of everyone who was at the party
last night. OK, Jones?

439
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,798
Yes, sir.

440
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:16,198
No, I didn't hear them arguing.

441
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:19,118
I went to say goodnight to the
horses, straight after dinner.

442
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:21,038
Do you do that every night?
Of course.

443
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:22,918
No-one else here worth talking to.

444
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:29,038
Do you hunt?
Me? No.

445
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,358
Or shoot, or fish?
Or anything like that?

446
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:33,438
No.

447
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:36,718
Then I'll show you something.
But you've got to keep it a secret.

448
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,398
Come on, dogs.
(BARKING)

449
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,385
I have to keep the dogs out.
Sid drives them mad.

450
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:58,878
Stay.

451
00:34:00,078 --> 00:34:01,998
This is Sid.

452
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:06,958
I rescued him from the hunt.

453
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,964
I thought hunting was illegal.
Yeah, right(!)

454
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:15,958
Who else knows about Sid?
Only Freddy.

455
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:18,038
Dad would be really livid.

456
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:20,958
Does your father hunt?
No, he doesn't have time.

457
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,878
Sucks up to them if they're posh,
though.

458
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,638
Lets them shoot and fish all over
the estate. Dad loves a bit of posh.

459
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:29,158
Like the Chetthams?
Oh, he's known them forever.

460
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,638
You and Freddy Chettham...are
you...?

461
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,478
Oh, God, no. We couldn't.

462
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:40,678
I mean, he's my best friend, we grew
up together. So, no, no way.

463
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:44,798
Hello, Sid...

464
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:47,078
Are you hungry? Are you?

465
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:50,518
MARTHA: What do you want?

466
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:54,118
What are you doing?
Keep your hands off me...

467
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:55,998
(LAUGHING)

468
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:05,211
I'm afraid I'm er, lost.
Me too.

469
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:08,590
Metaphorically speaking, of course.

470
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:14,930
I'm Detective Sergeant -
I know who you are.

471
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:18,558
Sit down.

472
00:35:20,158 --> 00:35:25,240
Did you hear your father arguing
with David Roper last night?

473
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,639
I heard Dad shouting at him, yes.

474
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:31,158
It's no big deal,
Dad shouts at everybody.

475
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:33,470
Except Golden Boy, of course.

476
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:37,758
'Golden Boy'? Adorable Freddy(!)
Don't you find him adorable(?)

477
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:39,958
Everyone does, you know.

478
00:35:40,058 --> 00:35:43,323
What about you.
Oh, I absolutely adore him(!)

479
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:45,918
But then I would, wouldn't I?

480
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:49,958
Why? By the way, me and Rupert,
there's nothing going on.

481
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,583
I just...love teasing him.

482
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:57,318
I'm not, ghastly phrase,
'in a relationship.'

483
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:01,678
Sorry to hear that.
You should be pleased, surely?

484
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:06,518
Did you have anything
stolen last night?

485
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:09,997
Why, sergeant, what can you mean(?)

486
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:12,358
Is that a double entendre?

487
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:19,038
The blow to the head could
have stunned him momentarily

488
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:21,758
but it certainly didn't kill him.
There are traces of bark,

489
00:36:21,758 --> 00:36:23,958
but he probably walked into a tree.

490
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:27,118
And your suffocation theory
is looking a bit shaky, Tom.

491
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,078
Is it? Why?

492
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:30,878
Cos there's no deviation
to the nose,

493
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:33,918
there's no bruising or any damage
to the mouth or lips.

494
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:35,558
And you'd expect to
find either or both

495
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:37,278
if the victim had been suffocated.

496
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,238
He'd had a lot to drink, George.

497
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:43,078
A bottle of brandy, at least.
And maybe he was so drunk

498
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:46,318
he couldn't put up a struggle,
hence no damage to the face.

499
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:48,398
When do we get the
toxicology report?

500
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:50,438
Tomorrow, or the day after.
Whenever.

501
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:56,118
Anyway, I'm going to open him up,
have a look at his ticker.

502
00:36:56,118 --> 00:36:58,078
Stay and watch the fun.
No, thank you.

503
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:07,878
I see absolutely no reason why
our privacy should be invaded.

504
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:10,678
It really is none of
the police's business.

505
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:12,798
Or anyone else's.

506
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:15,198
It's a private arrangement
between friends.

507
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:19,678
I don't know...it just seems wrong!

508
00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:22,478
What with the police treating
David's death as suspicious -

509
00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:26,118
They're just being super cautious
because of the damned burglary.

510
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,318
And it has absolutely nothing
to do with the family.

511
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:33,478
Imagine the publicity.

512
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:35,638
OK, but I'd really rather
not lie about it.

513
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:38,158
Darling...no-one
is suggesting you lie.

514
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:41,558
Discretion, Freddy. Not lying.

515
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:50,718
OK.

516
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:53,598
Discretion it is.

517
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,278
Good boy.

518
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,598
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

519
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:17,558
No more patients this evening,
doctor.

520
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:19,878
Thank you, Missus Painter.
See you tomorrow.

521
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:21,638
Goodnight.
Night.

522
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:43,918
(PHONE RINGS)

523
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:54,318
SYLVIA: Dr Goring.

524
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:56,198
Oh, hello.

525
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:02,838
All right, but you'd better come up
with a jolly good suggestion!

526
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:08,038
You don't seem to understand. If it
ever came out I could be struck off.

527
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:13,398
No. Absolutely not.

528
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:15,518
I simply cannot go on like this!

529
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,358
I reckon Roper came this way.
There's cigar ash here and there,

530
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:23,078
plus the odd footprint.

531
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:25,158
He zig-zagged that-a-way...

532
00:39:25,158 --> 00:39:27,358
there's signs of a struggle.

533
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:30,398
There's the empty brandy bottle
and a cigar butt here. Phil?

534
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,318
Plus, a dirty great lump of wood.

535
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:38,798
There.
Blood?

536
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:41,838
I reckon.
So, Roper didn't walk into the tree.

537
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,838
He got whacked over the head.

538
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:46,918
There's soft ground here, look.

539
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,438
The drag marks...go all the way down
to the Dower House.

540
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,678
So...Roper staggers about...

541
00:39:57,518 --> 00:40:00,118
swigging his brandy,
gets bashed over the head.

542
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:04,798
And some good samaritan hauls him
off down to the Dower House.

543
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:06,998
But who, eh?

544
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:09,558
Someone who followed him
from the big house?

545
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:12,318
Maybe Roper bumped into The Creeper.

546
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:16,478
He's full of brandy,
he's feeling brave, so he has a go.

547
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:18,798
The Creeper grabs
a handy log...bosh!

548
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:24,038
I don't think The Creeper is the
boshing type, Jones. (MOBILE RINGS)

549
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:28,798
Jones.

550
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:32,198
Oh...

551
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:36,158
Right. OK.

552
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:39,958
Yeah, thanks.

553
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,998
There's been another break-in, sir.
Hm?

554
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:45,638
Dr Sylvia Goring's surgery
in Midsomer Market.

555
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:49,318
That name rings a bell. She was
one of the guests at the dinner.

556
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:51,558
Oh, yes, yes.
You want me to check it out?

557
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:53,438
No, no, I will do that.

558
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:58,478
You go back over everyone's
movements after the birthday do.

559
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:01,958
See who could have followed
Roper out of the house.

560
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:06,638
Oh, and Jones?
Get me a copy of Roper's book.

561
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,758
Golden Geezer or
whatever it's called.

562
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,638
Yes, sir.

563
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:15,358
SYLVIA: No, I didn't hear a thing.

564
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,958
What's missing, Dr Goring?

565
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,598
Well, some petty cash,
according to Missus Painter.

566
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:23,718
And my fly rods, would you believe.

567
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,118
Came here looking for drugs
no doubt, and...

568
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,718
made off with my fly rods.

569
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:33,998
Extraordinary!
Do you keep drugs on the premises?

570
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:36,078
Certainly not.

571
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:38,798
Nothing to interest the
average low-life, anyway.

572
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:40,678
You have a picture missing there.

573
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:43,598
Good lord.

574
00:41:43,798 --> 00:41:45,718
Hadn't noticed that.

575
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:48,158
What was it?

576
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:50,478
Oh, just a picture of me and a...

577
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:53,798
jolly nice salmon I caught
in Scotland, I think.

578
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:56,798
It was in a rather
pretty silver frame.

579
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,518
Must have caught the burglar's eye.

580
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:05,158
Dr Goring, you were up
at Chettham Park House

581
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:08,758
were you not, for Freddy Chettham's
birthday party?

582
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:11,078
Yes, the Chetthams are
dear friends of mine.

583
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:12,958
As is Jack Filby.

584
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:15,838
David Roper? Is he a 'dear friend'
of yours?

585
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:19,438
'An acquaintance', shall we say.

586
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,118
Dr Goring?
What is it?

587
00:42:23,118 --> 00:42:26,438
I think the intruder's been going
through the patient's notes.

588
00:42:27,118 --> 00:42:29,038
What?

589
00:42:30,278 --> 00:42:32,198
There they are.

590
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:38,558
Why would the cat burglar -
Oh! Sir William Chettham.

591
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:42,158
Oh, I had those out this morning.
MISSUS PAINTER: But they were -

592
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:44,038
I needed to refer
to them this morning.

593
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,558
You're not suggesting it was
this Creeper chappy, are you?

594
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:55,678
Ah, yes...This could be where
your intruder got in.

595
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:57,958
Oh, but that's never unlocked.

596
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,878
Well, it's unlocked now.

597
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:02,878
Where's the key to this padlock
usually kept, Missus Painter?

598
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:05,678
In my desk.

599
00:43:05,678 --> 00:43:08,878
In your desk. And do you
ever leave your desk

600
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,238
when there are patients
in the waiting room?

601
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:14,118
Well...yes, I...I suppose so.

602
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:16,958
Are you suggesting a patient
may have taken the keys?

603
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,958
But our patients are so respectable!

604
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,838
They're all private!

605
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:34,238
Oh good, you found us! Only just.
Talk about off the beaten track!

606
00:43:36,038 --> 00:43:38,798
What do you think?
It's fantastic!

607
00:43:38,798 --> 00:43:40,958
What is it?
It's for Sid.

608
00:43:41,638 --> 00:43:43,518
Here, hold this.

609
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:45,918
I have to get him outside soon.

610
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:48,958
I'll leave the door open so he can
go out and forage, or try to.

611
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:52,678
Trouble is, he should
be with other foxes

612
00:43:52,678 --> 00:43:55,158
otherwise he won't develop
any social skills.

613
00:43:55,158 --> 00:43:57,358
Yeah, I know how he feels.

614
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,118
I spent all week in meetings
about the retail business.

615
00:44:00,118 --> 00:44:03,398
Jack wants to buy
this chain of shops.

616
00:44:03,398 --> 00:44:05,478
(SIGHS)
Tell him, Freddy.

617
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:07,798
Tell him you want out.
I can't.

618
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:10,318
He'd be devastated.

619
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,278
And what about Mum and Dad?
What would happen to them?

620
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:16,758
Look at us. You with your suit,
me with my animals.

621
00:44:17,798 --> 00:44:20,478
Poor old Martha, getting off
with anything that moves.

622
00:44:20,478 --> 00:44:22,478
It's family, Tals.
We're stuck with it.

623
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:24,718
Maybe David's dying
will change things.

624
00:44:24,718 --> 00:44:26,798
How?
I don't know.

625
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,758
Secrets coming out, clearing
the air. That sort of thing.

626
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,958
There's only one secret,
isn't there?

627
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:36,558
Even if it came out, would it
make things any better?

628
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:41,318
Oh, it's just one of those days.

629
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:44,278
Right, when are you
going to move Sid?

630
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:46,518
Can I help?
Course you can.

631
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:53,758
You're absolutely the only
human being I can stand.

632
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,638
You know that, don't you?

633
00:45:00,638 --> 00:45:02,838
What's that you're reading?

634
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:06,878
'The Golden Geezer.
My Story by Harry Godbolt.'

635
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:09,598
Actually, it was written
by this fellow, David Roper.

636
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:13,678
Is he the one that died at Chettham?
The very same.

637
00:45:15,558 --> 00:45:17,758
And now he really is a ghost writer.

638
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,758
Oh, ha ha(!)

639
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,918
Can I read it after you?

640
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:24,158
You certainly can.
Well, you can read it now.

641
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:26,398
Celebrity gangsters,
the curse of the age.

642
00:45:26,398 --> 00:45:28,398
Here, I'm not wading
through that stuff.

643
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:31,918
Hm, he's very good looking.

644
00:45:31,918 --> 00:45:33,958
Who? Godbolt?

645
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,838
Gosh, yes.

646
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:37,998
Oh, it's so subjective, that stuff.

647
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:42,278
Did you lock the back door?
Yes...

648
00:45:43,438 --> 00:45:45,958
Not that locking would
make much difference.

649
00:45:48,118 --> 00:45:51,398
I will see to it tomorrow...

650
00:46:23,558 --> 00:46:25,478
Tom...

651
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,838
Tom!
What? What? What?

652
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:32,718
Do I have to do everything myself?!

653
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:35,478
Come here, you!

654
00:46:38,558 --> 00:46:40,398
(GROANS IN PAIN)
Joyce?

655
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:44,478
Joyce!

656
00:46:44,798 --> 00:46:46,998
Joyce...

657
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:48,678
You all right?
Yeah.

658
00:46:48,678 --> 00:46:50,478
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

659
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:54,358
He was here, Tom! The Creeper!

660
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:57,118
He was here in our house!
Nevermind him, what about you?

661
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:59,518
Oh, my God. My mother's pearls.

662
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:01,398
At least lie down!

663
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:06,558
Oh, they're here.

664
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,518
Tom?

665
00:47:11,758 --> 00:47:13,638
What's that?

666
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:17,718
That's like the photo in the book.

667
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:20,118
And that - Oh...

668
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:23,278
No, don't...don't touch it.

669
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:27,158
Get the tweezers.

670
00:47:29,798 --> 00:47:31,678
Ta.

671
00:47:41,678 --> 00:47:45,847
I think that The Creeper
has made his first mistake.

672
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:54,819
JONES: These were returned to YOU?

673
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,379
Yes, they were returned anonymously.

674
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:00,659
Ah.

675
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:03,579
"Fake"? What's that about, then?

676
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:05,459
Well, it's obviously a message.

677
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:08,539
Look, The Creeper must be an
insider, mustn't he?

678
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:11,659
He doesn't just know peoples'
security setups,

679
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:14,299
he knows their habits,
their routines.

680
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:17,059
And their secrets. Secrets?

681
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:20,779
There's something linking the
Chetthams with Jack Filby.

682
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:24,019
And it's not just the Old Pals Act.

683
00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:26,299
So The Creeper's what? A tradesman?

684
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:28,259
A servant?

685
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:34,739
What about Rupert, Filby's creepy
butler? He's got brown hair.

686
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:37,499
This looks reddish, though.
Darker at one end.

687
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:40,499
Dye job, maybe. It's not gonna be
much help

688
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:43,499
unless we can find a match.
Well, it's worth a try, innit?

689
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:46,739
Get it down to the lab.
And THEN, Jones,

690
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:49,299
go to Chettham Park House...

691
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:55,179
and get confirmation that this
really is Filby's etching.

692
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:57,459
Right. What about you?

693
00:48:57,459 --> 00:49:00,819
Me, Jones? I am going to ask
Doctor Sylvia Goring

694
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:02,819
why she told me that this

695
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,299
was the photo of a salmon.

696
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:11,219
I knew it was yours, Doctor Goring,

697
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,939
because the framer has
very thoughtfully

698
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:17,139
put your name and address on
the back there. Look.

699
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:22,299
I had a lot of pictures reframed
recently. I must've lost track.

700
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:24,819
It's a great party, that. Yes.

701
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:26,739
Life was fun then.

702
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,619
(LAUGHTER)

703
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:41,059
Easy when you're young and foolish,
Inspector.

704
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:46,179
Why on earth would someone write
'fake' on that photo, do you think?

705
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:48,099
I really haven't the faintest idea.

706
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:52,139
Doctor Goring...

707
00:49:53,259 --> 00:49:56,099
When did you last speak to
David Roper?

708
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:58,699
The other day of course,
at Freddy's party.

709
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:02,259
And before that? He came to see me a
couple of weeks ago.

710
00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:04,699
May I ask what about?

711
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:07,139
Some book he wanted to write.

712
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:11,619
I told him I wouldn't have anything
to do with it.

713
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:13,099
Because?

714
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:14,979
People grow up.

715
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:18,219
People change.

716
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:23,419
Raking up the past serves no purpose
whatsoever.

717
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:29,899
That's all I have to say.

718
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,299
Yes, that looks like Mister Filby's.

719
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:37,659
So, the thief returned it, did he?

720
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,699
Bet that doesn't happen very often.

721
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:41,459
Is it a fake?

722
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:43,699
I wouldn't be surprised.

723
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:47,779
Mister Filby bought it off that old
fraud, Hugo Greening.

724
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:52,259
He was at the birthday do,
wasn't he? Oh, yes.

725
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,739
Oh! Well, he's one of the gang.

726
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:57,779
They turn up when summoned
and sing for their supper.

727
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,939
Greening used to have an art
gallery. Very chic.

728
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:03,819
But it all went pear-shaped.

729
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:05,819
Was David Roper one of the 'gang'?

730
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:07,939
He'd fallen out of favour.

731
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,339
He was very persona non grata,
was David.

732
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,179
Ah. Why was that?

733
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:15,059
Well, how would I know?

734
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,619
I am but a humble lackey.

735
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,739
How discreet.

736
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:22,619
What a good boy.

737
00:51:24,939 --> 00:51:27,019
It was because of me.

738
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:30,019
I had a fling with David, you see.

739
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:32,339
At Freddy's party last year.

740
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,739
It was alcohol-induced

741
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:38,179
and quite extraordinarily
unpleasant.

742
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,139
Daddy was furious.

743
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:43,979
Rupert didn't like it either.
Did you, darling?

744
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:47,139
Roper shouldn't have taken
advantage.

745
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:49,019
'Taken advantage'?

746
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:53,219
Oh, how sweet!

747
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:56,259
(LAUGHS) Is that why you followed
him into the park

748
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:58,339
and hit him over the head?

749
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:02,139
Be a man, Rupert.

750
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:03,619
Confess.

751
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:09,539
I was just going to rough him up a
bit, that's all.

752
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:11,339
Urgh...

753
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:13,099
(GRUNTS)

754
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:16,139

with a branch.'

757
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:25,979
Argh!

758
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:31,099
(FOX BARKS)

My knight in shining armour.

763
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:44,459
And you didn't see who this someone
was?

764
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:45,899
No.

765
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:48,059
Maybe it was this Creeper bloke.

766
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,459
If I'd have known,
I would've gone for him.

767
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,819
Oh, of course you would, darling.

768
00:53:01,419 --> 00:53:03,059
No.

769
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:06,059
Rupert the butler is definitely not
The Creeper.

770
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:07,859
He hasn't got the bottle.

771
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:10,939
So, Martha had a fling with Roper?

772
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:13,299
Yeah. Filby was very angry about it.

773
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:15,107
I'm not surprised.

774
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:20,459
I've had that policeman here again.

775
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:23,179
He knows I'm not telling him
everything.

776
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:25,339
He made me feel like a criminal.

777
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:29,779
Well, what am I to do?

778
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:37,059
All right.
Curate's Wood at two o'clock.

779
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,659
I could get someone from the
Art Fraud Squad

780
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,499
to take a look at it, if necessary?

781
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:54,019
I did explain to Jack that the
provenance was a mite dubious.

782
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:56,299
Does that mean it's dodgy?

783
00:53:56,299 --> 00:54:01,099
I...I explained that the plate
from which the etching was made

784
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:03,659
may be School of Rembrandt.

785
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:06,139
It's dodgy.
I do wish you'd stop saying that!

786
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:09,619
And you explained that, did you,
to Mister Filby?

787
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:13,779
About the plate?
Perhaps not in those words, no.

788
00:54:13,779 --> 00:54:16,739
Look, the main thing is,
Jack liked it.

789
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:19,699
And a couple of grand,
quite frankly,

790
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:21,859
is not of much consequence to him.

791
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:24,779
Whereas... Whereas to you...

792
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:29,539
Business has been very slow of late,
Inspector.

793
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:34,899
Mister Greening, I am not interested
in the provenance of this print.

794
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:38,539
But I am very interested in finding
out exactly what happened

795
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:41,219
to David Roper on the night he died.

796
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:43,459
Surely there's no mystery
about that?

797
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:45,859
The mystery is how he lived
as long as he did.

798
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:50,219
The man's liver must've been
cast-iron.

799
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:54,299
What about the row Roper had
with Mister Filby that night? Mm?

800
00:54:54,299 --> 00:54:56,499
It was er, over...

801
00:54:56,499 --> 00:54:59,179
another book that Roper was planning
to write, wasn't it?

802
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:01,339
About the good old days.

803
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,459
It may have been. I really wasn't
paying much attention.

804
00:55:04,459 --> 00:55:07,299
David always spread chaos and
confusion wherever he went.

805
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:09,379
Did Roper talk to you about this?

806
00:55:09,379 --> 00:55:12,019
We had a brief conversation
about it.

807
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:13,939
I wasn't much help, I'm afraid.

808
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:16,939
I didn't remember the gangster chap
at all.

809
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:20,659
Even though he came to all your
parties?

810
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:23,699
LOTS of people came to our parties.

811
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:27,539
They were extremely good parties.

812
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:31,779
Oh, champagne!

813
00:55:31,779 --> 00:55:34,179
Who wants champagne?

814
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:37,459
(CAMERA SHUTTER)

815
00:55:44,979 --> 00:55:47,539
Sir William Chettham there,
he was er...

816
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:49,979
your partner in the gallery,
wasn't he?

817
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,859
Of sorts.

818
00:55:51,859 --> 00:55:54,579
Once the parties were over
and the actual work began,

819
00:55:54,579 --> 00:55:58,379
Will lost interest. It took me years
to pay off the debts.

820
00:55:58,379 --> 00:56:00,619
Good old Will, of course,

821
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:02,619
fell on his feet.

822
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:11,139
Ask yourself why a man like
Jack Filby never remarried.

823
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:16,619
Ask yourself how the Chetthams
managed to make ends meet.

824
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:24,859
So Jack Filby and Isobel Chettham
were an item.

825
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:28,179
Hence the word 'fake'. Is that the
dark secret, d'you reckon?

826
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:30,179
I don't know, Jones.
Could be part of it.

827
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:39,019
'Art Fraud Squad'.

828
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:41,779
That was good. Yeah, not bad, hey?

(CROWS CAW)

830
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,059
Oh, there you are.

831
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:33,459
There's loads of rabbits in the
meadow. Take a potshot if you want.

832
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:37,179
Don't play silly beggars,
it's loaded.

833
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:48,009
Looks like she put both barrels
to her throat

834
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:50,369
and used the branch to push
the triggers.

835
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:52,489
Practically took her head off.

836
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:55,249
If she came out here to kill
herself...

837
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:58,369
why bother shooting a pigeon?

838
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:00,689
Someone could've grabbed the gun off
her.

839
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:03,529
Any signs of a struggle?
Not at first glance, no.

840
00:58:03,529 --> 00:58:05,529
Well, maybe she knew them.

841
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:07,609
Didn't see them as a threat.

842
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,889
Who found her? The gamekeeper.

843
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:14,689
He heard the gun, guessed it was
Doctor Goring, came over to chat.

844
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:17,409
Apparently Jack Filby let her
shoot here whenever she wanted.

845
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:20,213
And he saw no-one else?
No, sir.

846
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:27,609
Doctor Goring said 'Raking up the
past serves no purpose whatsoever'.

847
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:30,489
She knew something, Jones.

848
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:33,009
It troubled her immensely.

849
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,369
But she wouldn't talk about.

850
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:41,689
Maybe it's got nothing to do with the
Chetthams. Or Roper, or Jack Filby.

851
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:45,009
Who knows what was going on
in her mind?

852
00:58:47,249 --> 00:58:49,769
WILLIAM: No, it couldn't have been
an accident.

853
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:53,129
Sylvia was a fine shot,
and she knew how to handle a gun.

854
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:56,809
Was the birthday party the last time
any of you saw her?

855
00:58:56,809 --> 00:59:00,089
Yes. BARNABY: And how would you
describe her state of mind?

856
00:59:00,089 --> 00:59:03,529
You're not trying to suggest she
took her own life, are you?

857
00:59:03,529 --> 00:59:06,009
I came as soon as I heard the news.
Are you all right?

858
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,169
Devastated, Jack.
Utterly devastated.

859
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,729
What happened? He thinks that Sylvia
took her own life.

860
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:14,409
That's not exactly what he said,
Mummy.

861
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:16,409
This is an ACCIDENT, surely?

862
00:59:16,409 --> 00:59:18,809
The Inspector is determined to see

863
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:21,089
everything that happens on the
Chettham estate

864
00:59:21,089 --> 00:59:23,409
in the worst possible light.

865
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,249
I wonder why.

866
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:29,169
No mystery to this one, Tom.

867
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:32,969
Both barrels of a 12-bore shotgun
to the throat at very close range.

868
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,329
Now, there was one thing
that gave me pause for thought.

869
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:38,409
And that was the blood on her hand.

870
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,369
Hers? No.

871
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:43,969
So she did try and defend herself.
Not so fast, Benjamin.

872
00:59:43,969 --> 00:59:46,689
No, the blood belonged to the
pigeon.

873
00:59:46,689 --> 00:59:49,889
I took the liberty of bagging it.
Its neck had been wrung.

874
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:53,169
So she shoots the pigeon
and wings it...

875
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:55,369
She puts down the gun to wring its
neck...

876
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:57,529
The assailant picks up the gun...
Baboom.

877
00:59:57,529 --> 00:59:59,529
Sounds plausible to me.
By the way, Tom,

878
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,529
I've got the toxicology report
on that Roper chap.

879
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:04,569
Good, give us the gist.

880
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:07,929
Well...the alcoholic levels are
pretty consistent

881
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:10,369
with someone who'd have drunk a
bottle of brandy.

882
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:13,569
And I don't suppose the morphine
content was much of a surprise,

883
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,249
given his track record.

884
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:17,489
Morphine? Well, codeine, actually,

885
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:20,409
but codeine metabolizes
into morphine in the body.

886
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:23,689
My guess would be erm...
prescription pain killer.

887
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:26,529
How much did he take?
Oh, quite a lot.

888
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:29,649
About er...300 milligrams.

889
01:00:29,649 --> 01:00:31,649
Is that enough to kill him?

890
01:00:31,649 --> 01:00:33,809
Borderline, but I'd say it could be
enough

891
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:35,809
to cause respiratory depression.

892
01:00:35,809 --> 01:00:38,209
Or make it very easy to suffocate.

893
01:00:38,209 --> 01:00:40,289
Yes, but is it enough
to make a case, Tom?

894
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:43,529
Yes, thank you, George.

895
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:45,849
Jones...

896
01:00:46,889 --> 01:00:48,529
Jones...

897
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:51,609
There weren't any drugs found in
Roper's effects, were there?

898
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:54,809
No. Oh. No, not so much as an
aspirin.

899
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:56,769
Check with the Chetthams.

900
01:00:56,769 --> 01:01:00,649
The old grandmother must be on some
sort of medication, for starters.

901
01:01:00,649 --> 01:01:02,849
Won't that be on record at
Doctor Goring's?

902
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:04,769

wasn't she?

refer to them this morning.

01:01:20,129 --> 01:01:22,329
I'll check the surgery.

909

You go and have another look in the
guest room at the Dower House.

910
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:28,289
See if Roper had anything
stashed away. Yes, sir.

Come on. Let's get you back

Please, let me help.
No, I can manage.

I'm used to it.

Can I just ask something?

Does anyone in the house take any
sort of prescription painkiller?

answering a couple of questions?

Oh, yes. Of course.

She would be appalled to see me
blubbing.

934
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:59,689
Now, when did you last see
Doctor Goring?

935
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:03,209
After surgery this morning.
And how did she seem?

936
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:06,169
A bit on edge, to be honest.

937
01:03:08,209 --> 01:03:11,529
Missus Painter, did you ever meet
David Roper?

938
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:13,569
He was a friend of hers, I think.

939
01:03:13,569 --> 01:03:16,849
Yes. I didn't care for him at all.

940
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:19,609
He turned up unannounced
a couple of weeks ago,

941
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:22,369
but Sylvia sent him packing.

942
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:25,009
So what time did the surgery close
today?

943
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,209
The last patient left at 12:30.

01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:30,489
And then Doctor Goring...went out?

945
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:33,049
Yes. No! No, not quite.

946
01:03:33,049 --> 01:03:35,249
She did some shredding first.

947
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:40,369
Shredding? Yes. She bought one of
those machines last week.

948
01:04:14,089 --> 01:04:16,449
Nothing in the guest bedroom, sir.

949
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:19,529
But the old girl, Elizabeth?
She's on God knows what.

950
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:22,769
Beta blockers, statins, you name it.

951
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:25,489
Very off-hand when I mentioned
the painkillers.

952
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:29,249
Any joy at the surgery?

953
01:04:29,249 --> 01:04:31,569
Depends what you mean, Jones.

954
01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:34,809
Doctor Goring destroyed all the
Chettham family records,

955
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:37,289
apart from this.

956
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:39,169
Take a look.

957
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:47,409
"Victoria and Albert Clinic."

958
01:04:47,409 --> 01:04:49,089
So?

959
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:51,769
Happily for us,
that clinic still exists.

960
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:56,089
And they very kindly sent me this.

961
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:02,729
Wow...

962
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:08,849
Well, that explains a lot.
Doesn't it just?

963
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:10,889
Roper must have found out somehow
or other

964
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:13,509
and threatened to write about it.
Blackmail.

965
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:16,329
What now?

966
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,249
I think...

967
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:23,769
..the less time they have to cover
their tracks, the better.

968

(PHONE RINGS)

969
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:30,329
Hello?
'Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby.'

970
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:32,209
Inspector, good afternoon.

971
01:05:32,209 --> 01:05:37,009
'Sir William...There's something I'd
very much like to talk to you about.

972
01:05:37,009 --> 01:05:39,049
Something of a personal...'

973
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:40,713
..nature.

974
01:05:44,896 --> 01:05:46,534
Very personal.

975
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:54,729
He knows.

976
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:57,725
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

977
01:06:03,849 --> 01:06:06,529
Hello, Freddy.
We've come to see your father.

978
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:09,512
I know. He's up at the house.
I'm to take you there.

979
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:12,589
Everybody's waiting. Everybody?

980
01:06:15,649 --> 01:06:18,689
FILBY: Well, let's get on with it,
then.

981
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:21,689
What I have to say concerns
Sir William,

982
01:06:21,689 --> 01:06:24,969
and I'd much rather discuss
that with him in private.

983
01:06:24,969 --> 01:06:27,169
Let me put you out of your misery,
Inspector.

984
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:31,809
In the wake of poor Sylvia Goring's
death,

985
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:34,969
you've unearthed something
in my medical records.

986
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:37,889
Something that has piqued your
curiosity.

987
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:40,929
Grubbing around in other people's
affairs. Despicable.

988
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:42,675
Quiet, Elizabeth.

989
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,569
Am I on the right track?

990
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:47,849
Yes, you are.

991
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:52,449
And that something is the fact that
I am unable to father children, yes?

992
01:06:52,449 --> 01:06:54,009
Yes.

993
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:56,209
"Shooting at blanks",
don't they say?

994
01:06:56,209 --> 01:06:58,209
I believe they do, yes.

995
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:02,009
We found out soon after Isobel
and I were married.

996
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:06,089
That I would be unable to produce
a son and heir.

997
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:10,489
It was a terrible blow, Inspector.
Yes, it must have been.

998
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:14,769
And it begs a very large question.

999
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:17,849
Yes, indeed.
Who, then, is Freddy's father?

1000
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:21,769
Well, legally, of course, I am.

1001
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:23,849
And biologically?

1002
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:26,329
Yes, I am.

1003
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:28,409
I'm very proud to say.

1004
01:07:29,649 --> 01:07:32,689
ISOBEL: It was an arrangement
between friends, Inspector.

1005
01:07:32,689 --> 01:07:34,609
A PRIVATE arrangement.

1006
01:07:36,129 --> 01:07:38,769
Well, I'm off.
Stay where you are, Tallis.

1007
01:07:38,769 --> 01:07:41,329
I thought there was going to be some
amazing revelation.

1008
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:44,049
This is ancient history.

1009
01:07:44,049 --> 01:07:46,809
WILLIAM: All the children know,
Inspector. Come on, girls.

1010
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:49,609
They were told as soon as
they were old enough to understand.

1011
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:51,929
You may find this hard to believe,
Barnaby,

1012
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:55,209
but it's a situation that's turned
out very happily for all concerned.

1013
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:59,089
Yes. We're all deliriously happy.
Thank you, Martha, that's enough.

1014
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:01,989
But you weren't very happy when
David Roper found out, were you?

1015
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:04,249
Did he threaten to write about it in
his book?

1016
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:06,409
David always knew, Inspector.

1017
01:08:06,409 --> 01:08:10,569
He could've written about it
any time in the past 25 years.

1018
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:13,609
Unfortunately he's not around to
confirm that, is he?

1019
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:15,779
Well, ask Hugo Greening.

1020
01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:20,569
Er, our dearest and closest friends
have always known.

1021
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:22,849
It's my name on Freddy's
birth certificate.

1022
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,889
When I die, he will become
the 13th baronet.

1023
01:08:25,889 --> 01:08:28,249
And by then I'm sure he'll be
well on his way

1024
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:30,609
to re-establishing
the Chettham family fortunes.

1025
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:33,009
I'll do my best, Dad. 'Dad'.

1026
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:37,929
You see, Inspector, that is the
reality of the situation.

1027
01:08:39,169 --> 01:08:41,729
ELIZABETH: The
Inspector's looking disappointed.

1028
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:45,649
He was hoping to bring Chettham Park
tumbling down round our ears.

1029
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:48,089
I was hoping to find out the truth.

1030
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:49,769
That is all, Lady Chettham.

1031
01:08:49,769 --> 01:08:52,649
THAT is Lady Chettham, Inspector.

1032
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:55,209
The wife of the 12th baronet.

1033
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:58,089
As the widow of the 11th baronet,

1034
01:08:58,089 --> 01:09:01,569
the proper form in my case is
'My Lady'.

1035
01:09:03,209 --> 01:09:05,409
And the correct form in MY case

1036
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:08,249
is 'Detective Chief Inspector',

1037
01:09:08,249 --> 01:09:10,169
'My Lady'.

1038
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:16,409
So this boy Freddy can still inherit
the title?

1039
01:09:16,409 --> 01:09:19,449
Yep. Yes, he can.
When Sir William Chettham dies...

1040
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:24,689
..it goes to some committee or other
in the Lord Chancellor's office,

1041
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:26,689
and if all the paperwork's in order,

1042
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:28,569
nobody rocks the boat...

1043
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:32,369
Maybe that's what Roper threatened
to do. You said he was broke.

1044
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,729
Erm, there's something more to
it than that, Joyce.

1045
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:39,089
When I confronted them,
they were all there,

1046
01:09:39,089 --> 01:09:42,649
about Sir William's infertility...

1047
01:09:43,769 --> 01:09:47,049
..there was an air of immense relief
in the room.

1048
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,369
Hm.

1049
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:51,249
How's 'The Golden Geezer' then, 'ey?

1050
01:09:52,409 --> 01:09:57,409
It's rubbish. And the most ludicrous
bit features your Chief Constable.

1051
01:09:57,409 --> 01:09:59,929
Lovell? What's he doing in it?

1052
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,689
Well, he caught Harry Godbolt.

1053
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:05,049
That's what he got
the Onslow medal for.

1054
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:08,609
Didn't you know?
I must have forgotten.

1055
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:10,769
I wonder...

1056
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:13,809
if he was at that party.

1057
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,169
I'm not understanding you here,
Joyce.

1058
01:10:16,169 --> 01:10:18,689
Why would Lovell be at the party?

1059
01:10:18,689 --> 01:10:22,769
Well, he was at university with the
Chetthams and that lot, wasn't he?

1060
01:10:22,769 --> 01:10:24,969
He was? Mm.

1061
01:10:24,969 --> 01:10:28,049
You don't know very much about your
beloved leader, do you?

1062
01:10:28,049 --> 01:10:29,969
Well, obviously not.

1063
01:10:33,369 --> 01:10:34,689
Joyce...

1064
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:41,929
How would you describe...Isobel's
expression in the photo there, hm?

1065
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:46,849
Adoring.

1066
01:10:46,849 --> 01:10:48,329
Adoring...

1067
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:51,334
Yes. That would be the word.

1068
01:10:52,559 --> 01:10:55,950
The report on Godbolt's arrest
tallies with the book.

1069
01:10:56,769 --> 01:10:59,489
I was surprised, actually.
Why were you surprised?

1070
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:03,009
Harry Godbolt's on the run
with an army of minders,

1071
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:06,569
and Chief Constable Lovell wanders
into a West End hotel room,

1072
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:09,689
'on a hunch', and there's the most
feared gangster in the land,

1073
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:11,889
fast asleep and on his tod.

1074
01:11:11,889 --> 01:11:14,849
And what is your deduction,
Detective Stephens?

1075
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:17,449
Well, somebody must have tipped
Mister Lovell off.

1076
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:21,889
But who'd tip off a PC who'd only
been in the job six months?

1077
01:11:21,889 --> 01:11:23,969
Yeah. Who indeed?

1078
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:28,009
Oh, I almost forgot.

1079
01:11:28,009 --> 01:11:31,689
Forensic report for you, sir.
Ah! Did they run a DNA match?

1080
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,005
Very droll, sir.

1081
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,169
It's the way you tell 'em.

1082
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:42,249
Listen, erm, I've had a thought
about Roper's computer.

1083
01:11:42,249 --> 01:11:44,089
Did you. What about it?

1084
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:46,889
The bag and the power lead were
still on the floor

1085
01:11:46,889 --> 01:11:49,209
when we were called to
the Dower House.

1086
01:11:49,209 --> 01:11:52,689
Yeah, so? The bag's in the evidence
room with the rest of his stuff,

1087
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:54,689
but the mains lead is nowhere
to be found.

1088
01:11:56,089 --> 01:11:59,129
You think someone at the Dower House
snaffled it?

1089
01:11:59,129 --> 01:12:02,849
Well, The Creeper's never nicked
anything like that before, has he?

1090
01:12:02,849 --> 01:12:06,009
If one of the Chetthams did take the
laptop...

1091
01:12:06,009 --> 01:12:08,929
It might still be at the
Dower House.

1092
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:13,969
Let's get a search warrant, shake
the tree and see what falls out.

1093
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:15,969
Yes, sir.

1094
01:12:15,969 --> 01:12:18,045
Oh, what was that about DNA match?

1095
01:12:18,145 --> 01:12:21,329
Oh, yes. The hair.

1096
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:28,529
Anything?

1097
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:32,049
No.

1098
01:12:32,049 --> 01:12:33,929
No. Nothing.

1099
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:46,185
Thanks for this.
It's much appreciated.

1100
01:12:46,185 --> 01:12:48,425
Tallis likes you.
That's good enough for me.

1101
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:50,585
Despite what happened yesterday?

1102
01:12:50,585 --> 01:12:53,345
It had to come out sooner or later.
I'm glad it has.

1103
01:12:53,345 --> 01:12:56,665
It must be very...hard for you,
Freddy.

1104
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:58,625
Sometimes I...

1105
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,545
Sometimes you what?

1106
01:13:00,545 --> 01:13:02,425
Oh, nothing.

1107
01:13:03,585 --> 01:13:05,585
Here we are.

1108
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:07,945
OK. Give us a couple of minutes.
(HORSE SNORTS)

1109
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:15,065
Hiya!

1110
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:16,345
Hey.

1111
01:13:18,905 --> 01:13:21,345
How's Sid? Lonely.

1112
01:13:21,345 --> 01:13:24,585
Hm. And how are you, Tallis?

1113
01:13:24,585 --> 01:13:27,585
Me? Worried about Freddy.

1114
01:13:27,585 --> 01:13:29,745
So many people to please.

1115
01:13:29,745 --> 01:13:32,225
It's bad enough having one dad,
nevermind two.

1116
01:13:33,385 --> 01:13:35,785
Yesterday, up at the Hall,

1117
01:13:35,785 --> 01:13:37,825
you seemed a little disappointed.

1118
01:13:37,825 --> 01:13:39,625
Did I? Yes, you did.

1119
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,865
As if you were expecting to hear
something else from me.

1120
01:13:45,825 --> 01:13:48,825
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

1121
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:50,625
DNA.

1122
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:54,345
It's wonderful stuff, that.
Is it? Yes, it is.

1123
01:13:54,345 --> 01:13:56,745
It's amazing how much information
you can glean

1124
01:13:56,745 --> 01:13:59,825
from the tiniest particle.
Like a hair.

1125
01:13:59,825 --> 01:14:03,825
It's all you need to single out one
person from millions of others.

1126
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:05,785
Or one animal.

1127
01:14:05,785 --> 01:14:08,265
An animal? Like a fox.

1128
01:14:11,505 --> 01:14:13,025
Tallis...

1129
01:14:14,505 --> 01:14:19,945
The Creeper kindly delivered a
picture to my house.

1130
01:14:19,945 --> 01:14:24,345
And there was a tiny hair
caught in the frame.

1131
01:14:24,345 --> 01:14:28,225
I think the picture was a message.

1132
01:14:28,225 --> 01:14:30,185
What about?

1133
01:14:30,185 --> 01:14:33,425
About something that happened
25 years ago.

1134
01:14:36,865 --> 01:14:40,145
Maybe The Creeper was
in someone's house one night

1135
01:14:40,145 --> 01:14:44,665
and overheard something.
Like a weird phone conversation.

1136
01:14:44,665 --> 01:14:48,305
DOCTOR GORING: You don't understand.
If it came out, I could be struck
off.

1137
01:14:48,305 --> 01:14:51,465
FEMALE VOICE: 'For the sake
of the family -' No.
'Sylvia -' Absolutely not.

1138
01:14:51,465 --> 01:14:53,985
I simply cannot go on like this.

1139
01:14:55,585 --> 01:14:57,505
Oh, I see.

1140
01:14:58,905 --> 01:15:03,065
So, you think The Creeper was hoping
that I would discover the truth?

1141
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,185
And have you?

1142
01:15:05,185 --> 01:15:07,105
I'm not sure.

1143
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:13,145
What are you going to do about
The Creeper? Don't know.

1144
01:15:13,145 --> 01:15:15,305
I can't go to the
Crown Prosecution Service

1145
01:15:15,305 --> 01:15:17,705
and say that my chief suspect
is a fox, can I?

1146
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:19,625
I suppose not. No.

1147
01:15:22,705 --> 01:15:27,225
If I could be sure that The Creeper
was going to stop creeping...

1148
01:15:27,225 --> 01:15:31,345
and the stolen property returned
in good order...

1149
01:15:31,345 --> 01:15:33,225
to the police...

1150
01:15:34,585 --> 01:15:36,505
That would be a start.

1151
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:40,785
I bet The Creeper would be very
interested to hear that.

1152
01:15:49,505 --> 01:15:52,225
David was alive...that night.

1153
01:15:52,225 --> 01:15:55,305
'After Rupert knocked him out.
I know he was.'

1154
01:16:01,185 --> 01:16:03,945
He was alive when I took him back
to the Dower House.

1155
01:16:03,945 --> 01:16:05,945
And later too, when he was in bed.

1156
01:16:15,105 --> 01:16:16,825
'I checked.'

1157
01:16:16,825 --> 01:16:18,745
'He was still breathing.'

1158
01:16:24,025 --> 01:16:26,225
I should've tried to do more
for him.

1159
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:28,585
It wasn't your fault, Tallis.

1160
01:16:34,105 --> 01:16:36,065
Pleasant walk, sir?

1161
01:16:36,065 --> 01:16:38,785
Very pleasant indeed, thank you,
Jones.

1162
01:16:38,785 --> 01:16:42,065
Right. Let's go and stir up
the Chetthams.

1163
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:45,265
I'm afraid it's gonna have to wait.

1164
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:46,865
Why?

1165
01:16:46,865 --> 01:16:49,145
The Chief Constable wants
to see you.

1166
01:16:49,145 --> 01:16:51,025
Oh, he does, does he?

1167
01:16:52,105 --> 01:16:53,665
Good.

1168
01:16:54,825 --> 01:16:56,145
Good?

1169
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:12,545
Mm-hm.

1170
01:17:14,425 --> 01:17:16,065
Barnaby.

1171
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:18,185
I want a progress report on the
er...

1172
01:17:18,185 --> 01:17:19,785
The Creeper, Sir.

1173
01:17:21,105 --> 01:17:25,385
The housebreaking epidemic which is
making a nonsense of my targets.

1174
01:17:26,985 --> 01:17:30,105
Sir, there have been two suspicious
deaths.

1175
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:31,945
I'm aware of that.

1176
01:17:31,945 --> 01:17:33,945
And one of 'em...

1177
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:36,025
was David Roper.

1178
01:17:36,025 --> 01:17:38,025
The author of this book.

1179
01:17:38,025 --> 01:17:39,865
I'm assuming that er,

1180
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:42,385
David Roper consulted you
when he was writing this book,

1181
01:17:42,385 --> 01:17:44,465
because after all, it was you

1182
01:17:44,465 --> 01:17:47,465
that finally brought Harry Godbolt
to justice, wasn't it?

1183
01:17:47,465 --> 01:17:50,185
We may have had a telephone
conversation, yes.

1184
01:17:50,185 --> 01:17:53,185
But then you probably already knew
David Roper,

1185
01:17:53,185 --> 01:17:57,105
because you were at university
with him, were you not? Was I?

1186
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,185
Along with Jack Filby,
the Chetthams,

1187
01:17:59,185 --> 01:18:03,025
and...Doctor Sylvia Goring.
Barnaby, what are you driving at?

1188
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:06,625
I'm trying to clarify the situation
before I write my report.

1189
01:18:07,745 --> 01:18:10,625
You know how people jump to
conclusions.

1190
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,185
Make connections that do not exist.

1191
01:18:18,825 --> 01:18:21,865
That crowd were out of my league
at university, Barnaby.

1192
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:24,305
I didn't really know any of them.

1193
01:18:24,305 --> 01:18:26,425
Except Isobel.

1194
01:18:26,425 --> 01:18:28,345
Extraordinary woman.

1195
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:31,545
Yeah, I admit I was an admirer.

1196
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:34,065
I didn't stand a chance, of course.

1197
01:18:34,065 --> 01:18:37,025
But we became friends, of sorts.

1198
01:18:37,025 --> 01:18:39,025
And she trusted me.

1199
01:18:39,025 --> 01:18:40,945
So.

1200
01:18:40,945 --> 01:18:44,225
I'd only been on the beat for
six months when she got in touch.

1201
01:18:44,225 --> 01:18:46,665
She was in a terrible state.

1202
01:18:46,665 --> 01:18:48,585
What, because of erm...?

1203
01:18:48,585 --> 01:18:51,225
I didn't ask what the circumstances
were, Barnaby.

1204
01:18:52,345 --> 01:18:54,905
Godbolt had been on the run
for months.

1205
01:18:54,905 --> 01:18:59,505
She told me where I could find him.
Alone and unguarded.

1206
01:18:59,505 --> 01:19:01,665
What could I do?

1207
01:19:01,665 --> 01:19:04,705
Here was a great opportunity.
To make your name.

1208
01:19:04,705 --> 01:19:07,105
To put away a dangerous criminal,
Barnaby.

1209
01:19:07,105 --> 01:19:09,905
Oh, yes, sir. Of course. I'm sorry.

1210
01:19:09,905 --> 01:19:12,545
I saw no reason why her name
should be mentioned.

1211
01:19:12,545 --> 01:19:14,425
And I still don't.

1212
01:19:21,905 --> 01:19:25,105
Oh. Barnaby. It's you.

1213
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:27,785
Sir William,
I'm so sorry to bother you again.

1214
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,865
Yes, I'm sure you are.

1215
01:19:42,985 --> 01:19:46,585
David's laptop? Mm-hm.
I thought the burglar took it.

1216
01:19:46,585 --> 01:19:51,585
Well, we're not sure now. We think
Mister Roper might've tucked it away
somewhere for safety.

1217
01:19:51,585 --> 01:19:53,865
Here at the Dower House? Yes.

1218
01:19:53,865 --> 01:19:55,665
Now, I know you wouldn't mind me
er...

1219
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:59,225
having a look around, but I've got
a search warrant here anyway.

affairs.

1222
01:20:04,665 --> 01:20:06,665
And when would you want to do this,
Inspector?

1223
01:20:06,665 --> 01:20:09,225
Now, if that would be convenient.

1224
01:20:09,225 --> 01:20:11,145
You never give up, do you?

1225
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:13,065
No, it's irritating, isn't it?

Oh! I'm so sorry.

1228
01:20:17,265 --> 01:20:18,905
Excuse me.

Yes.

01:20:26,305 --> 01:20:28,065
Yeah, well, of course. Right away.

1232
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:33,785
I'm very sorry er, but something
erm, seems to have come up.

1233
01:20:35,225 --> 01:20:37,145
Now, look, it's er,
it's getting late.

1234
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:41,105
How about if I send a team round
tomorrow?

1235
01:20:56,665 --> 01:20:58,665
We'll give it a couple of hours.

You drove me off the road!

1241
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:19,098
I shall make a complaint.

Of course you will, Lady Chettham.
As soon as we've looked inside.

You step out of the car, please.

regarding Freddy.

You still haven't answered my
question

1254
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,520
about DNA testing, Inspector.

1255
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,880
Well, maybe...Lady Chettham could.

1256
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,840
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

1257
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,000
And then maybe you could er,

1258
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,640
tell your husband about your part
in the arrest of Harry Godbolt.

1259
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,680
What? I want my pills.

1260
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,440
This is intolerable, treating
an elderly woman like this.

1261
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,360
I'll get them myself.
Sit DOWN, Isobel.

1262
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,800
What's this about Harry Godbolt?

1263
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:41,760
Sir William, David Roper visited
Harry Godbolt regularly in prison

1264
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,600
when he was ghosting Godbolt's
autobiography.

1265
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,320
Godbolt was terminally ill.

1266
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:50,400
In the end, he couldn't resist...

1267
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,320
..boasting about his affair...

1268
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:58,520
..with
the beautiful wife of the baronet.

1269
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,560
It will all be there, won't it?

01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,840
He didn't know, did he, ever,

1276
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,280
that it was you who turned him over
to the police?

1277
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,720
But did he know that you were
pregnant?

1278

Lies.

It's all lies, darling!
Jones, what do we have there?

1280
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,720
We have...beta blockers,

Yes, all right.

1285
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,080
I gave David some pills.

1286
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,680
He came to my room.
He forced me to hand them over.

1287
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,120
He came to your room, did he?
Yes, now give them to me.

Even though he was so drunk he
could hardly stand? Give them to me!

Give her the pills! Shut up, Isobel!

1290

If only you'd stayed out of that
frightful man's bed!

1291
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,280
David Roper just had to go,
didn't he?

1292

Poor David.

1293

Though I would have done it. Gladly.
For the sake of the family.

Is it true?

01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,480
Harry Godbolt is Freddy's father?

1321
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,960
Yes.

1322
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,440
But Jack was a better prospect.

1323
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,440
I knew he would provide for Freddy.

1324

Unfortunately the blood tests prove

that Filby couldn't possibly be the
