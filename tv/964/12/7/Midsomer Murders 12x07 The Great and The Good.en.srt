Oh, thank God! Thank God.

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,540
Could you come down and let us in?
He's on the stairs.

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,420
Or the landing. I think he's on the
landing.

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,780
Don't you think he might have
scarpered by now?

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,660
You think so?
What with the noise, sort of thing.

31

Well, you could throw the door key
down.

What's happened?

Connie thinks there's an intruder.
Again.

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,660
Still on the landing, she reckons,
having screamed the house down.

37
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,660
Well, maybe we should suspend
judgment, until we can ascertain
what has actually occurred.

Well, maybe we should suspend

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,540
Yeah. Precisely.
I've just remembered.

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,260
There's a spare key under the flower
pot.

41

Right, OK.

42

OK.

Yeah.
Right.

There was definitely someone there.
I swear. Imogen!

Are you all right?
There was someone on the landing.

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,180
Really.

55
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,100
Well, that's awful.

Do you think perhaps you need your
dressing gown?

57

someone in the house.

JONES: Overactive imagination,
according to some of the neighbours.

61
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,460
This is from the officers who
answered the call.

62
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,820
What about the other neighbours?
Well, not quite so dismissive.

63
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,180
Someone was seen loitering not far
from her cottage two weeks ago, late
at night.

64

Someone was seen loitering not far
from her cottage two weeks ago, late
at night.

65
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,620
Then a month ago she told friends
she thought someone had been in her
house -

66
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,980
reckoned things had been moved.

67
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,820
But she has been found sleepwalking
a couple of times on the village
green.

68
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,900
In a bit of an agitated state,
apparently.

69
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,860
I mean, whatever the truth of it,

70
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,540
the officers who answered the call
said she wasn't putting it on;

71
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,380
that she genuinely was very
frightened.

72
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,420
What does she do, this lady?

73
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,820
She's the village school teacher.

74
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,820
Oh, Connie. Connie Bishop.
Yes, the Mrs Barnaby knows her.

75
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,961
Well, I've always taken her for a
very serious, sensible young woman.

76
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,740
Well, there's no sign of a forced
entry. Windows shut, back door
locked.

77
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,220
She kept a spare key under a flower
pot, though.

78
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,900
And who knew about that?
Only half the village.

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,780
Only half the village. Yeah.

please? Listen to Jacqueline.

About last night...
Ah.

89
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,700
I'm afraid I may be wasting your
time.

90
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,860
I think I must have been dreaming.

91
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,860
Well, let's hope you were.

92
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,260
Well, better that than having a real
intruder.

93
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,180
Well, yes, I suppose so.

94
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,540
The officers who attended the scene
said you were sure it wasn't a
dream.

95
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,780
Well, yes. I do remember waking up
and then hearing the noises.

96
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,820
The footsteps on the landing and
creaking floorboards.

97
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,020
But people do sometimes dream
they've woken up, don't they?

98
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,980
When they are, in fact, still
dreaming.

99
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,740
I can't think what else it could
have been.

100
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,020
I mean, I didn't think much about it
at the time, when Jim said the back
door was bolted.

101

Councillor Hanley, Neighbourhood
Watch man - one of the first on the
scene.

102
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
And all the windows were closed.

103
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,980
I was leaning out of my window,
calling for help.

104
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,900
I would have seen anybody escaping
through the front door.

105
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,060
So, there couldn't have been anybody
there.

106
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,180
Now, listen. I understand absolutely
what you're saying,

107
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,020
but just to be on the safe side, and
for your own peace of mind,

108
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,060
I think you should consider changing
the lock on the front door.

109
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,700
Really?
Really.

110
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,814
And you mustn't leave your spare key
under the flower pot.

111
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,180
Yes. Fair enough.

112
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,540
Now, this is my number.

113
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,420
And do not feel embarrassed to give
us a ring

114
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,380
the second you think you've got
another intruder. All right?

115
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,580
There you go. That should help you
sleep more easily.

116
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,900
You're very kind.
I'm sure there won't be anything.

117
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,740
Odds are she was imagining it.

118
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,500
But the fact that back door was
locked from the inside

119
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,220
doesn't rule out the possibility
there really was an intruder, does
it?

120
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,500
And if there was an intruder,
he could have left by that back door,

121
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,300
come in again with the others, locked
the back door from the inside before
anyone saw it,

122
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,980
to make it look as if no-one could
have left that way.

123
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,540
Hmm. Yeah.

124
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,860
Or just stayed in the house and
pretended to come in with the
others.

125
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,340
Yes.

126
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,900
Yes, I think we ought to keep an open
mind.

Yeah.

appointed in the first place.

130
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,700
I can't see her running it for much
longer. Can you?

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,020
Leaning out of windows in the middle
of the night, screaming?

it?

Oh, please!

She lives in an utter fantasy world.

135
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,940
No, allowing her to continue as
Chairperson just wouldn't be fair to
her.

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,460
Quite apart from the charity.

We have to take steps.

on her conscience...

heating at the hall?

154
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,540
Good question!
And then there's the leaking roof.

155
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,940
Zukie's suggesting that we hire an
all-weather marquee for Frobisher
Night.

156
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,220
Zukie's suggesting that we hire an
all-weather marquee for Frobisher
Night.

157
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,180
On the green.

158
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,780
And I really think a sizable chunk
of what we raise should go towards
the new hall this year.

159
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,740
Do you know how much all-weather
marquees cost?

160
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh, don't you worry about that.

161
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,500
Don't worry? Frobisher Night is
about trying to raise money,

162
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,740
not squander it away on expensive
marquees.

163
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,820
Now, you mustn't get upset.

164
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,100
I'm not getting upset.

165
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,620
And we've always had Frobisher Night
at the hall.

166
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,740
Darling, if we want to attract the
kind of people who are going to bid
serious money at the auctions,

167
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:01,900
Darling, if we want to attract the
kind of people who are going to bid
serious money at the auctions,

168
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,420
then we've got to provide the kind
of venue in which they'll feel at
home.

169
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,780
Oh, dear.

170
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,060
You have been badly shaken, haven't
you?

171
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,940
I'm perfectly fine.

172
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
(CRYING) So stupid!

173
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,580
I'm sorry. (SOBS)

174
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,900
Ah, Jenny, tea. Perfectly timed.

175

(CONNIE GROANS)

176
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,180
It's not about raising extra cash
for good causes.

177
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,580
It's about raising her profile with
the local bigwigs.

178
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,140
The glitterati.

179
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,060
That's what ladies who lunch a lot
live for.

180
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,980
She's right about us needing a new
hall.

181
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,540
The school gets way, way too much of
the proceeds, anyway.

182
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,700
And if we're honest, there aren't
enough children to even justify it
being there.

183
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,700
The school is the heart of the
village. And the children are the
future.

184
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,460
Feel a song coming on, Jim? (LAUGHS)

185
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,740
Oh, you can laugh.
We have to make a stand.

186
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,700
Somebody has to.

187
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,060
At the end.

188
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,300
Jim...!

189
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,620
What is it with him these days?
(DOOR CLOSES)

190
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,260
I told her we could stump up the
money for the deposit, but she just
wouldn't have it.

191
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,540
She has no vision.

192
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,300
And fewer and fewer people attend
each year.

193
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,820
And why people support her...

194
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,540
When you say 'we' can stump up the
money for the deposit...

195
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,340
Oh, I'm sorry, babes. I should have
mentioned it, but I didn't think
you'd mind.

196
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,100

You know how grateful I can be.

201

Yes, it is.

I knew there was something wrong.
I knew it.

268
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,540
How did you know?
He was troubled.

269
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,820
He was very troubled. I should have
taken more notice, listened to him.

again tomorrow.

Excuse me.

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,020
Well, Tom, it was a very sharp
knife.

276
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,500
Used approximately one and a half
hours ago.

277
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,700
About the time the intruder was in
Connie's house.

at work.

Home from home, isn't it, boy?

283
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,860
He knows us pretty well now.

284
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,420
Now, Mrs Stroud... Oh, thank you.

285
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,700
You said last night you thought Jim
Hanley was 'troubled',

286
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,260
and you felt you should have listened
to him more.

287
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,700
Yes.

288
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,980
It was a conversation we had in the
pub.

289
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,180
This is the Black Swan?
Yes.

290
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,060
I was talking to him about the
Frobisher Committee.

291
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,780
Ah, Frobisher Night.
The dinner-dance thing?

292
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,820
Yes, and how I wished he hadn't
resigned the chairmanship.

293
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,300
Yes, and how I wished he hadn't
resigned the chairmanship.

294
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,300
And then he started talking about...?
Reputations and secrets.

295
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,140
He'd had a few drinks by then, so I
wasn't taking him too seriously.

296
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,980
'Something about how sometimes
secrets have to be revealed.'

297
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,100
Go on, Councillor - get it off your
chest. It's always best, you know.

298
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,940
(WEARILY) Easy for you to say.

Nah, nah, let the poor man drown his
sorrows. What are you having, Jim?

301
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,460
Nah, nah, let the poor man drown his
sorrows. What are you having, Jim?

302
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,820
At the time, I thought it was just
Jim being his moody old self.

303
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,260
At the time, I thought it was just
Jim being his moody old self.

304
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,980
You knew the Councillor quite well?
40 years.

305
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,820
I served with him at the council for
20.

306
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,340
But I don't think I ever knew him
really well.

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,060
He was very polite and reasonable,
but there was always something in
reserve - you know?

308
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Mrs Stroud, do you know why Jim
Hanley resigned from the Frobisher
Committee?

309
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,380
I know he didn't enjoy it as much as
he used to, before Zukie and the
rest joined.

310
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,580
I know he didn't enjoy it as much as
he used to, before Zukie and the
rest joined.

311
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,980
We had to put up with them because
Zukie's husband has been so generous
over the years.

312
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,060
We had to put up with them because
Zukie's husband has been so generous
over the years.

313
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,140
To the charity.

314
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,700
Poor man. She well and truly has got
her claws into him.

315
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,020
What about friends and family of the
Councillor?

316
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,580
Not really. Divorced years ago.
No children.

317
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,620
We were wondering whether the man I
saw outside Connie's house

318
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,540
might have anything to do with it.

319
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,020
You were the one who saw this man
acting suspiciously?

320
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,980
Yeah, he rushed off when he saw me.
Otherwise, I don't think I'd have
noticed.

321
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,540
So, what was he doing?
It was dark.

322
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,780
I didn't get a good look,

323
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,660
but it was in almost the same place
Jim Hanley was killed, so I just
wondered.

324
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,220
OK, that's it.
(BELL)

325
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,140
Inside.

326
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,460
Thank you.

327
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,180
Hi.
Hi.

328
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,460
I thought I'd just... I heard about
last night. Sounds terrible.

329
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,540
Wasn't great.

330
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,500
Anyway, I just wanted to say, if
there's anything I could do...

331
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,300
I wanted to thank you for the other
night. I was just helping out.

332
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,060
I don't normally hang out of
windows, calling for young men to
come and rescue me!

333
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,460
(CHUCKLES)

334
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,860
I don't know what the women of the
village think of me.

335
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,580
Oh, well, we've all been there.

336
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,300
I mean...I didn't mean...

337
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,340
Because obviously, we...we haven't
erm...

338
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,980
Yeah... I think that's my phone.

339
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,020
Thank you, Justin.

340
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,820
(DOOR BELL)

341
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,060
Good morning. I'm Detective Chief
Inspector Barnaby from Causton CID,

342
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,500
and this is Detective Sergeant Jones.

343
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,780
We'd like to talk to Mrs Richardson,
please.

344
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,620
Come in.
Thank you.

345
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,340
This way.

346
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,660
ZUKIE: If we get the hall back in
proper condition, it's something the
whole community can use.

347
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,620
MAN: Let me think about it.
We're not talking about a huge
amount of money...

348
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:40,740
MAN: Let me think about it.
We're not talking about a huge
amount of money...

349
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,460
Mrs Richardson...
Just a minute.

350
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,860
It's far less than you donated to
the school.

351
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,300
That was money well spent.
Mrs Richardson?

352
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,180
(ANGRILY) Will you please...

353
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,900
Inspector Barnaby, and Detective
er...Constable... Who was it?

354
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,340
Inspector Barnaby, and Detective
er...Constable... Who was it?

355
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,220
Detective Sergeant Jones.

356
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,780
This must be about Councillor
Hanley. Terrible thing.
Thank you, Jenny. That'll be all.

357
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,540
This must be about Councillor
Hanley. Terrible thing.
Thank you, Jenny. That'll be all.

358
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,300
Yes, it is about Councillor Hanley,
and we're talking to everyone that
knew him.

359
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,220
Of course.

360
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,260
Oh, this is my husband, Howard.

361
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,180
Mr Richardson.

362
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,740
Shocking. Please...

363
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,340
I really only knew him from the
Committee work.

364
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,660
He seemed a pleasant enough man.

365
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,140
Er...Mr Richardson, did you know him
at all?

366
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,780
Erm...nice man, I thought.

367
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,700
I can't imagine he had any enemies.

368
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,060
Wasn't anything to do with
Neighbourhood Watch, was it?

369
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,500
We just don't know, sir.

370
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,340
He was very fond of Connie, of
course.

371
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,215
'Very fond'?

372
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:54,060
Well, if I'm brutally honest, it
was...bordering on obsession.

373
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,420
Connie didn't mention it?

374
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,300
How did this erm...obsession manifest
itself?

375
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,060
Oh, body language.

376
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,460
He couldn't disguise it.
It was very odd.

377
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,940
Still, some people like needy types,
don't they?

378
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,420
Were you aware of it, sir -
this obsession?

379
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,780
I didn't see much of him, so I
couldn't really comment.

380
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,300
There's no question it had anything
to do with Connie?

381
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,980
We're not ruling anyone out or in at
this moment, sir.

382
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,500
Where were you both between 11:30 and
12:30 last night?

383
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,380
I was in bed with my husband.

384
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,420
We went up at about 11, didn't we,
Howard?

385
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,700
I came up a bit later.

386
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,860
You were already asleep, actually.

387
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,300
It must have been about 11:30.

388
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,140
And ten times five, William, is...?

389
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,700
Fifty.
Brilliant. Fifty.

390
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,460
Look!
(LAUGHTER)

391
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,820
Can you take over, please?
Listen to Jacqueline.

392
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,026
OK, shh. Next one. Who can tell me
eleven times five?

393
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,540
I was just passing, and I thought
I'd er...drop in and disrupt your
class for a bit.

394
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,660
Well, ten out of ten! No, it's about
that lock you needed changing.

395
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,360
I'd say the Councillor had a bit of
a soft spot for Connie.

396
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,120
Not sure I'd say he was obsessive.

397
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,160
And his relationship with Zukie
Richardson?

398
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,120
He put up with her. Like we all do.

399
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,440
God knows what old Howard sees in
her.

400
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,120
No fool like an old fool.

401
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,360
His money inherited?
Oh, no. Started his own electronics
company. Retired now.

402
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,640
Is he involved in a lot of charities?

403
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah, but understated. You know?
Put a shed-load into the village
school.

404
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,520
They've got the building as long as
they want it now. All repairs and
upkeep taken care of.

405
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,640
They've got the building as long as
they want it now. All repairs and
upkeep taken care of.

406
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,817
Everything?
The whole lot.

407
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,840
Good evening.
I saw you at the school today.

408
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,120
Really? I didn't have you down as a
curtain-twitcher.

409
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,240
I hope you're not taking advantage of
Connie's vulnerable state.

410
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,920
She's asked me to go and take a look
at her front-door locks.

411
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,000
Not that it's any business of yours,
mate.

412
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,760
Is there a problem?

413
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,640
It's laughing boy who's got a
problem.

414
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,483
Just...just don't take advantage of
her.

415
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,440
I'm going round to Connie's later to
sort out her locks...

416
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,920
as I think you suggested.

417
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,400
It's amazing, innit? You try and do
your bit to help.

418
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,240
All you get is sculptors abusing
you.

419
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,580
Keep it civil, gentlemen.

420
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,580
Planning notice.

421
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,060
(KNOCKS AT DOOR)

422
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,940
Oh, an extension.

423
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,860
You'd need a ladder to get into the
upstairs windows.

424
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,260
Yeah, it's fairly secluded,
if there was a ladder handy.

425
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,900
There are window locks.
I think they're OK.

426
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,140
I can get Laurence to have a look
when he comes.

427
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,700
That's a good idea.
What a lovely garden you have.

428
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,220
Thank you.

429
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,340
I see you've got a planning
application for an extension.

430
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,380
Would you lose a lot of the garden?

431
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,420
Quite a bit, sadly.

432
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,460
Assuming the permission comes
through.

433
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,300
Actually, I'm not sure it will now.

434
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,820
Jim was always positive about the
chances, but as he's gone...

435
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,100
Jim was always positive about the
chances, but as he's gone...

436
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,220
Was he on the planning committee?

437
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,420
That's right. I hope that doesn't
make me sound callous.

438
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,740
No, of course it doesn't.

439
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,940
I'll miss him.
Hm.

440
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,700
Miss Bishop, we have to ask: do you
have a boyfriend at the moment?

441
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,740
No, I don't. And to be honest,
I can't really see the relevance.

442
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,078
We've heard that erm...Councillor
Hanley was interested in you...

443
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,680
romantically.

444
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:48,408
'Obsessed' was the word used.

445
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,620
That's ridiculous.
Jim was just a nice man.

446
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,740
We got on well. We were friends.

447
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,420
You didn't ever feel he was
attracted to you?

448
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,135
No. Not in that way.

449
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,714
And I think it says more about the
people making the accusation

450
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:05,329
than the person they're accusing.

451
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,274
I can probably make a wild stab at
who it might have been.

452
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,060
I think Connie could do with a bit
of company, now that she's back at
the cottage.

453
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,100
That's right. She'll be getting all
spooked over there on her own.

454
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,620
What about it, Justin? I'm sure
she'd be pleased with a bit of
company.

know his cake

478
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,580
I couldn't believe what he was
saying down at the pub just now.

479
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,020
What did he say? Well, he was going
on about how keen you were on him.

480
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,980
'Gagging for it' was the charming
phrase he used.

481
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,500
I know. I always thought he was OK.

482
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,620
But that wasn't the worst of it, I'm
afraid.

483
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,660
He said he might hitch up with you,

484
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,660
because he might end up living in
his old house again.

people, isn't it?

487
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,820
But then again, maybe it was just
his idea of a joke. I don't know.

Mmm. Now, this is the lock you want

Well, I was wondering about the
planning application for Connie
Bishop's house.

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,580
Ah, the extension.
What's the situation there?

Oh, it has every chance of going
through.

record, that he thoroughly approved.

children are moving in.

very difficult, I think.

tickets for Frobisher Night.

00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,740
I wondered whether you might give
them up this year.

536
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,420
Give them up?

537

Oh, but we go every year.

538
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Yes, well, that's rather the point.

539
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,140
We wondered if you might give
somebody else a chance this time
around.

anything at the auction?

Well...we got that sirloin of beef
that time. Didn't we, Ted?

really what it's about this year.

We do have some lavish and
extraordinary lots.

realistically contribute,

where it was before.

Why did you go back out there?

606
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,260
I had a bad dream.

607
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,780
I just woke up feeling a bit...
dehydrated, hung-over,

608
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,620
I just woke up feeling a bit...
dehydrated, hung-over,

609
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:41,300
and I remembered that Laurence was
in the summer house, so I went to
see if he was still there.

610
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:41,340
and I remembered that Laurence was
in the summer house, so I went to
see if he was still there.

611
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,713
The weather was foul.
You must have had a very good reason

612
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:47,659
to go back out to the summer house.

613
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,700
(DOOR OPENS)
I just wanted to see if he was OK.

614
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,780
Er...Mrs Stroud's here to see Miss
Bishop, sir.

615
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,055
Yeah, ask her to hang on for a bit,
please.

616
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,700
But I think you ought to stay with
Mrs Stroud again.

617
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,100
At least until forensics have
finished here.

618
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,855
Oh, my God.

619
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,534
What?
I've just remembered.

620
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,196
Laurence said he knew who the
murderer was.

621
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,180
Oh, my God.

622
00:46:27,628 --> 00:46:30,161
Well, who was it?
He didn't say.

623
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,886
He just said he knew who it was.

624
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,511
Connie, what did he say, exactly?

625
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,540
I'd been going on about how people
in the village thought I was crazy,

626
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,100
and half of them probably thought
I'd killed Jim Hanley,

627
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,237
and he said he knew I hadn't.

628
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,898
I said it was sweet of him to say
so, but he couldn't really be sure,

629
00:46:55,137 --> 00:46:57,321
and he got sort of irritated and
said...

630
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,840
he knew I hadn't done it, because he
knew who had.

631
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,060
I told him he should tell the
police.

632
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,956
I said he could be in danger, if he
knew who it was.

633
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,660
And then he said he didn't mean it.

634
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,300
That he'd been joking.

635
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:17,232
But he wasn't joking.
I know he wasn't.

636
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,300
How did you know?

637
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,480
Because he asked me not to mention
it to anyone.

638
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,860
And you don't say that if you've
been joking.

639
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,895
And he gave no clue at all as to who
he thought the murderer was?

640
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,100
No. No, he didn't.

641
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,420
Did you tell anyone about this?
Did you make any phone calls?

642
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,640
No.
I've only just remembered myself.

643
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,160
What do you think, sir?
Is she telling the truth?

644
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,960
You remember Mrs Stroud going on
about Jim Hanley in the pub,

645
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
talking about secrets and
reputations?

646
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,920
Well, Laurence was there too, and I
wonder if Laurence got the Councillor
to explain

647
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,800
who he was talking about.

648
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,800
The thing I hate most about all of
this is how suspicious it makes you
of everyone.

649
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,840
I just...I can't trust anyone.

650
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,920
I'm not even sure if I trust myself
any more.

651
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,480
Sometimes I think I'm going mad.

652
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,280
MRS STROUD:
You're bound to feel wobbly.

653
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,200
I can't believe what Justin said.

654
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,480
I thought he was OK.

655
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,160
Now I find out he's a complete...

656
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,480
How could he?

657
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,400
What are you talking about?

658
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,160
You didn't hear what he said in the
pub?

659
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,560
Apparently, he was telling everyone
he thought he'd get hitched up with
me,

660
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,960
so he could get his old house back,

661
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,200
and how it would be easy, because I
was 'gagging for it'.

662
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,600
Justin didn't say that.
Who told you? Was it Laurence?

663
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,800
He was there.
I know he was there. So was I.

664
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,080
Laurence and Vince were winding
Justin up.

665
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,440
They were the ones talking about him
having his cake and eating it.

666
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
Justin was actually defending you.

667
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,760
Defending me?
Well, of course he was.

668
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,920
Wasn't Justin upset at what Vince
said about getting his shoes under
Connie's bed?

669
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,400
Wasn't Justin upset at what Vince
said about getting his shoes under
Connie's bed?

670
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,840
Yes, he was. Definitely.
See?

671
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,760
Nice cup of tea?
Oh, thank you.

672
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,440
I don't like to speak ill of the
dead, but that swine Laurence

673
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,200
must have been trying to put you off
Justin to give himself a better
chance.

674
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,640
Justin loves you.
You must know that.

675
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,600
He doesn't?
Of course he does.

676
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,560
He's mad about you. Isn't he,
Imogen?

677
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,440
He is. It's just, he doesn't have
the courage to tell you.

678
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,960
I was so rude to him outside the
shop today.

679
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,840
Oh, he'll get over it.

680
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,240
And what's he going to think about
last night?

681
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,400
Talk to him. Explain what happened.

682
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,320
Everything's going to be all right.

683
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,040
Come on!

(DOOR CLOSES)

685
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,080
JONES: So, if what Connie said was
true...

686
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,560
..Laurence may have been killed to
stop him revealing who the murderer
was.

687
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,640
But why here? And why last night?

688
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,560
And how did the killer know Laurence
would be in the summer house?

689
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,000
At half-past one in the morning.

690
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,120
Could it have been the lurker...
from a couple of weeks ago?

691
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,200
Back again. Happened to see them.

692
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,600
Well, if it was the lurker who was
the killer...

693
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,520
..that means our besotted Councillor
Jim Hanley was not.

694
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,800
I think it's time to talk to the wise
man of the village.

ZUKIE: I'm just relieved we took
over when we did.

697
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,880
Connie's obviously in no state to do
anything now.

698

We're not cancelling Frobisher
Night? Absolutely not!

MAN: Come on!

700
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,440
Oh, and I've managed to get
commitments from two more local
celebrities and an Honourable.

701
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,640
Oh, and I've managed to get
commitments from two more local
celebrities and an Honourable.

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,040
Wonderful! I'll see you.
See you.

703
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,560
MAN: About time.

704
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,160
Do you think, Vince, that the
er...the lurker...

705
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,560
was someone local?

706
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,480
It was a bit odd, old Jim Hanley
being found there.

707
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,800
In the same spot where Imogen saw
the Peeping Tom.

708
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Do you think Jim Hanley was, you
know, that way inclined?

709
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,800
Well, there were pointed comments
from his wife before they divorced.

710
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,560
She definitely gave the impression
that he was one of life's voyeurs.

711
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,240
Being a Peeping Tom is pretty
reprehensible behaviour,

712
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,600
but having your throat cut seems a
bit extreme.

713
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,800
I don't think we should jump to any
conclusions about the motive just
yet.

714
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,840
I think there's something you should
know. It's not definitely
suspicious, but it was a bit odd.

715
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,280
In the circumstances.

716
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,440
Yes, go on.

717
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,960
It was yesterday, just here.

718
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,880
I saw Connie talking to Justin,
and they had words.
She was very off with him.

719
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,680
Anyway, it was all because of a lie
that Laurence told.

720
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,320
Saying Justin was only interested in
Connie because he wanted to get his
old house back.

721
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,120
'His old house'?
Yeah, where Connie lives now.

722
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,040
Two years ago, when Justin split up
with Claire...

723
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,080
That's his ex. Lovely girl. Didn't
deserve her.

724
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,000
..they had to sell the house, and
Connie bought it.

725
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,800
Anyway, I was thinking...

726
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,240
if Justin found out what Laurence
had been saying about him,

727
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,120
he wouldn't be too pleased.

728
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,040
No, I was never too keen on
Laurence, but that was not a nice
way to go.

729
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,600
Darts team will miss him.

730
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,960
Pushed his luck, though, with his
womanising.

731
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,560
Hmm. That's true. There'll be one or
two people out there with motives.

732
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,640
Not mentioning any names.

733
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,240
Yeah, but he's got to be on their
list, though, hasn't he?

734
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,120
What with his being smitten by
Connie,

735
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,840
and Laurence trying to muscle in on
the two of them.

736
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,520
I'm not saying he's the murdering
kind, of course.

737
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,600
Very decent of you, Vince.
Thank you(!)

738
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,920
Mind you, I'm not so sure you could
say the same about the subject of
his affections.

739
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,440
Definitely a troubled soul, our
Connie.

740
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,600
What with her nightmares and
sleepwalking

741
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,680
and screams in the middle of the
night.

742
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,920
Who knows what's going on inside
that head of hers?

743
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,760
Connie's the gentlest of people.

744
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,000
Absolutely. Lovely person.

745
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,440
I'm sure you're right.

746
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,800
But it's worth bearing in mind that
anyone who's shown any amorous
interest in her so far

747
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,720
But it's worth bearing in mind that
anyone who's shown any amorous
interest in her so far

748
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,207
has ended up with their throat cut.

749
00:54:25,978 --> 00:54:28,089
I'm going off this pub.

750
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,920
Oh! I thought I might find you here.

751
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,640
Hello.
Oh, sorry. Do you want to go in?

752
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,960
Actually, Justin, it was you I
wanted to talk to.

753
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,678
Oh. Shall we...?

754
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,680
So, er...how have you been getting
on?

755
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,520
Well, I'm staying at Mrs Stroud's,
but it's not ideal.

756
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,760
I've decided to go back to the
cottage tomorrow.

757
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,680
The police should be finished by
then.

758
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,487
Are you sure you'll be all right
there on your own?

759
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,075
Well, that's why I wanted to talk to
you.

760
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,720
You know you said, if there was
anything you could do for me, to
just ask?

761
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,280
Yeah.

762
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,320
I wondered if you might come over
for supper tomorrow.

763
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,196
I think I'm gonna find the evenings
a bit difficult, and I could do with
the company.

764
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,120
If you're not doing anything.

765
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,320
No, no, of course. I'd love to.

766
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,440
Oh, great. About 7:30?

767
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,360
Great.

768
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,240
See you then.

769
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,700
And the entrance here, I think.

770
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,180
Excellent. Good.

771
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,460
Excuse me.

772

I just pray there isn't another
murder.

I didn't particularly like Laurence.
Actually, I positively disliked him.

Ah. And why's that?

779
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,780
He was a liar, full of himself,
rude. The list goes on.

780
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,580
And you didn't like him flirting
with Connie?

781
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,740
She should have had more sense than
to have anything to do with him.

782

How long have you known Connie?

783
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,100
Erm...I met her when I was showing
her round the cottage.

784
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,780
You lived there with your ex-wife,
didn't you?

785
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,660
Girlfriend.
What happened there?

786
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,260
She walked out on me.

787
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,380
She needed her half of the house, so
we had to sell.

788

I'm not a wealthy man.

789
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,140
Well, we'll need her contact
details.

790
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,820
Well, she's quite good friends with
Imogen. Try her.

792

yoga classes, and they were out on
the pull together.

Pretty weird, wanting the house,

with all the bad memories of a
broken relationship.

796
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,660
You'd think he'd want a fresh start
somewhere else.

797

Mind you, it's pretty odd, Connie
wanting to move back in so soon.

invested.

Yes...though I'm not sure quite how
many of his millions he has now.

Justin's ex-girlfriend, Claire

Do you know how we can get hold of
her?

No, I've no idea.

Well, he said you knew her quite
well.

822

to yoga classes together.

Oh, just general background - you
know.

What was their relationship like?

826
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,180
Not great. They went out with each
other for a couple of years,

827
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,420
bought the cottage together, and
then they just drifted apart.

828

Do you know why?
They were never very well suited.

829

Do you know if she kept in touch
with anyone in the village?

For my sake and for everyone else's.

953

No. Look, you were sleepwalking.

954
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:38,980
You woke up in what you thought was
a threatening situation and you
lashed out.

01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:39,100
You woke up in what you thought was
a threatening situation and you
lashed out.

956
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:42,260
I do not think that is an
imprisonable offence.

But you don't...

958

You don't know what you've done when
you've been sleepwalking, do you?

959
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:53,380
And you don't always know whether or
not you've been sleepwalking when
you wake up.

01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,740
You're talking about the murders,
aren't you?

961
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,740

night Laurence was killed?

Well, I didn't tell you everything.

When I looked down at my hand, in
the dream...

..I was holding a knife.

965
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,953
And I heard a voice, inside my
head...

966
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,140
..saying, 'Kill him'...

967
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,580
..over and over.

968
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,624
And the night Jim Hanley died...

969
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,220
..and I found the back door open...

970
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:40,220
(SNIFFLING) ..I think there
were muddy boot prints

971
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,681
by the back door.

972
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,380

973
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,860
And they got smeared with all the
coming and going

974
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:52,060
of the police and everything.

975
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,100
But I don't know how they got there.

976
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,500
I know I should have mentioned it
before.

977
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,820
I'm sorry.

978
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:07,060
So, you think you put on your boots
in your sleep...

979
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,860
..went outside, killed someone,

980
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,780
in your sleep?

981
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,380
Homicidal somnambulism.

982
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:23,660
I don't believe in that, Connie, and
I don't believe you should, either.

983
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,620
But were there any traces of blood on
you?

984
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,620
On your hands or anywhere?

985
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,500
I had a shower.
Oh, yeah.

986
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,940
I didn't do it on purpose or
anything.

987
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:42,740
I was just all muddy and wet,
and I needed to warm up.

would have been washed away.

Connie Bishop says that she may be
the one

who slit the throats of our two
murder victims.

Yeah. In her sleep.

999
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,220
What on earth put that idea into her
head?

1000
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,700
Well, she says she's a regular
sleepwalker,

1001
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,260
and she had a dream on the night of
the second murder,

1002
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,500
where she's holding this knife,

1003
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:37,500
while a voice inside her head kept
saying, 'Kill him, kill him.'

1004
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:42,100
But I can't believe that Connie
Bishop is our killer. Can you?

1005
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,580
Anyway, she wanted to be in a prison
cell tonight.

1006
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,580
For her own protection and everyone
else's, she said.

1007
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:52,020
So, that's what we've done,
to err on the side of caution.

1008
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:54,472
Do you want to turn out the light?

Oh, I'm really going to drop off
easily now(!)

1010
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:04,382
Of course, sleepwalking can
be used as a valid defence

1011
01:12:04,482 --> 01:12:05,860
...against a murder charge.

1012

You released Connie?

1021
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,152
Well, she was talking about booking
in for another night tonight,

1022
01:13:31,252 --> 01:13:33,540
so I said we'd play it by ear.

1023
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,660
Got a bit of interesting news,
though.

1024
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,060
I've just been talking to Justin's
ex, Claire, on the phone.

1025
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:43,420
Imogen contacted her after we'd seen
her, and explained how we're trying
to get hold of her.

1026
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,700
So, they did keep in touch.
Yeah.

1027
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,860
Anyway, Claire says Justin wasn't
violent at all during their
relationship.

1028
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,900
If anything, he was too nice.

So, there goes your 'body under the
patio' theory.

1030
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,100
Yeah.
But there is something.

1031
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,540
Something about this house.

1032
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,460
It all revolves around this house.

1033
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:06,460
Come on.

1034
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:15,060
Murder one on the pathway at the
bottom of Connie's garden.

1035
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,580
Murder two in the summer house.

1036
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,460
Laurence's death.

1037
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:25,420
Let's assume for a moment, shall we,
that Connie was telling us the truth?

1038
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:30,540
Laurence told Connie that he knew
the identity of the murderer.

1039
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,700
But he didn't tell her the name.

1040
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,300
She told him to tell the police,

1041
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,540
because knowing the identity of the
murderer meant

1042
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,300
that he might be in danger himself,
from the murderer.

1043
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,142
But Laurence said that the murderer
didn't know that he knew.

1044
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:51,900
Perhaps Laurence was blackmailing
them...anonymously.

1045
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,100
Yeah. Yes.

1046
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,980
And that's probably the best
explanation

1047
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:58,620
for why he didn't tell the police.

1048
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,420
And then he's killed.
Murdered in his sleep.

1049
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:06,140
Cold-blooded, premeditated murder.

1050
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,780
As if whoever did it

1051
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,340
wanted to prevent their identity from
being revealed...

(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING)

1053
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,100
..or just to get shot of a
blackmailer.

1054
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:20,100
But how or when did they realise it
was Laurence?

1055
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,580
Laurence was virtually passing out

1056
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,820
when Connie put him to bed in the
summer house.

1057
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,300
He couldn't have talked to anyone.

1058
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,340
And Connie said that she didn't,
either.

1059
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:34,980
So, the murderer knew that
Laurence knew who they were,

1060
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:39,940
which also means the murderer would
have known it was Laurence who was

1061
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:44,580
Yeah. But why wait until Laurence
comes up here to Connie's cottage?

1062
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:44,780
Yeah. But why wait until Laurence
comes up here to Connie's cottage?

1063
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,700
Wouldn't that make it more risky?

1064
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,860
I mean, why not kill him as soon as
they knew?

1065

Yeah.

1070
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,620
I was holding a knife, and I heard a
voice inside my head...

1071
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,660
..saying, 'Kill him.'

1072
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,780
What on earth put that idea into her
head?

1073

Well, she's a regular sleepwalker.

They haven't got a match on the
blood,

1082
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,700
but they managed to get a partial
print off the knife handle.

It's Connie Bishop's.

1084
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:58,860
Well, it looks like she's tried to
wipe it clean and missed a bit.

1085
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,220
So, if the blood matches the
victim's, Connie is our killer.

1086
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,940
So, what's going on, sir?
Was she genuinely sleepwalking

1087
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,060
and didn't know what she was doing?

1088
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:14,740
Or was it all a double bluff, and
she was compos mentis all the time?

1089
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,220
That is a very good question, Jones.

of a wonderful human being...

Yes, please.

What about Connie's fingerprints on
the knife?

1110
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:25,480
Well, if the killer could get into
Connie's cottage while she was
asleep,

1111
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,440
he could have pressed the knife
handle onto her fingers.

1112
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,760
She'd been drinking, had a bottle or
two.

1113
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,760
The killer knew she wouldn't wake up
easily. Could even have triggered the
dream.

(BLEEPING)

1115

I didn't mention it earlier, because
I thought the killer might, you
know, be listening in.

1116
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,920
Didn't see any harm in suggesting
that Connie was our chief suspect.

Lull him into a false sense of
security.

1118
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,960
But if it wasn't Connie, how did the
murderer get into the cottage after
killing Laurence?

1119
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,640
But if it wasn't Connie, how did the
murderer get into the cottage after
killing Laurence?

1120
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,760
She'd just had her locks changed.

1121
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:01,000
I've spoken to Connie. Apparently,
she gave the spare key to Laurence
for safe-keeping.

1122
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,960
But I've also spoken to Georgie
Bullard.

1123
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,840
No sign of any key on the body.

1124
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,640
I think the killer took the key to
get into this house.

1125

Ahh.

1126

in,

1127
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,160
when Laurence volunteered to become a
key-holder.

Yes.

01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,480
Having fun?

1213
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,920
Howard knew that if the council
granted Connie planning permission
for the extension,

1214
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,640
and Connie's sister moved back in
with her three kids,

1215
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,400
then that school could go on
for one, two years, at least.

1216
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,100
But Howard needed that school to
fail,

1217
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,997
so he'd get back possession of the
building...and sell it.

1218
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:43,000
But the good Councillor was not for
bribing.

1219
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,080
I've decided to grant planning
permission, so you can do your
worst.

1220
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,680
And if you decide to tell people
what you saw that night,

1221
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,720
I shall tell them that you tried
to...to blackmail me...

1222
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,674
which won't do your reputation much
good, either.

1223
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,880
It's up to you.

1224
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,640
Well, it's all sort of academic now,
anyway.

1225
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,320
She doesn't want you to grant
planning permission.

1226
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,840
What are you talking about?

1227
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:12,160
She's decided she can't face the
thought of her sister and all the
children coming to stay.

1228
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,280
But she wants it to look as if she's
tried, so as not to upset her
sister.

1229
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,120
I don't believe you.

1230
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,686
Well, look. Why don't we go and ask
her? Get it from the horse's mouth.

1231
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,200
She'll still be up. I only spoke to
her five minutes ago.

1232
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,760
Give me a moment.
I'll just get a jacket.

1233
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,520
And he took the Councillor to
Connie's cottage,

1234
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,040
to make it look as though Connie was
involved?

1235
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,400
Initially, it was to get him away
from his own house - that's what he
said.

1236
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,640
'But when he saw Connie go to the
back door of her cottage to let the
dog out,

1237
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,080
he thought, "Ah, I'll take advantage
of that."'

1238
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,760
(GRUNTING AND CHOKING)

1239
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,760
'He said it was an opportunity he
could not refuse.'

1240
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:08,960
So, he nipped inside, hid, waited for
Connie to go to bed,

1241
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,360
and then, using her boots,

1242
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,920
put her muddy footprints by her back
door.

1243
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,080
And what about the builder -
Laurence?

1244
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:21,600
Laurence? Well, when Howard found out
that Laurence knew he was the
murderer

1245
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,320
Laurence? Well, when Howard found out
that Laurence knew he was the
murderer

1246
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,560
and was blackmailing him, to boot,

1247
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,480
well, he had no choice.

1248

(LAURENCE GRUNTING)

1249
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,640
(CHOKING)

1250
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,160
Then all Howard had to do...

1251
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,960
..was to put Connie's fingerprints on
the end of the knife,

1252
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,600
and leave that knife where it could
easily be found,

1253
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,320
as indeed it was, by the little dog.

1254
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,880
And he put all those transmitters in
himself?

1255
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,880
Yes, he did. Electrical engineer.
Boffin par excellence, apparently.

1256
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,043
You can't trust anyone.
No, you can't.

1257
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:10,051
Well, we can hope we get a decent
night's sleep tonight.

1258
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,960
I wouldn't count on it.

1259
