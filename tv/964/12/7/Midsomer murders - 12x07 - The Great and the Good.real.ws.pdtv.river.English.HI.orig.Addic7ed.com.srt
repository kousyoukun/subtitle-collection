Please! There's somebody in my

There's somebody in my house!
It's Connie.

Oh, thank God! Thank God.

26
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,554
Could you come down and let us in?
He's on the stairs.

27
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:00,434
Or the landing. I think he's on the
landing.

28
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,794
Don't you think he might have
scarpered by now?

29
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:06,674
You think so?
What with the noise, sort of thing.

30
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:08,514
Well, you could throw the door key
down.

31
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:10,794
Just a minute.

32
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:15,354
Not a lot of fabric in that nightie,
is there? I mean that in the nicest
possible way.

33
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:18,394
Oi, oi. Neighbourhood Watch is here.
What's happened?

34
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:20,394
Connie thinks there's an intruder.
Again.

35
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,674
Still on the landing, she reckons,
having screamed the house down.

36
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:29,874
Well, maybe we should suspend
judgment, until we can ascertain
what has actually occurred.

37
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,554
Yeah. Precisely.
I've just remembered.

38
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:35,274
There's a spare key 
under the flower pot.

39
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:37,154
Right, OK.

40

Right, lads?
Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:25,514
Do you want to go and look around,
then?

00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,674
Yeah.
Right.

50
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:30,954
There was definitely someone there.
I swear. Imogen!

51
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,594
Are you all right?
There was someone on the landing.

52
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:37,194
Really.

53
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,114
Well, that's awful.

54
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:42,634
Do you think perhaps you need your
dressing gown?

55
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:45,594
I'm serious. There was definitely
someone in the house.

56
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:48,034
Why is this happening?

57
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:53,794
JONES: Overactive imagination,
according to some of the neighbours.

58
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,234
This is from the officers who
answered the call.

59
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:59,594
What about the other neighbours?
Well, not quite so dismissive.

60
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:05,114
Someone was seen loitering not far
from her cottage two weeks ago, late
at night.

61
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:08,394
Then a month ago she told friends
she thought someone had been in her
house -

62
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:10,754
reckoned things had been moved.

63
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:14,594
But she has been found sleepwalking
a couple of times on the village
green.

64
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:16,674
In a bit of an agitated state,
apparently.

65
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:19,634
I mean, whatever the truth of it,

66
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:23,314
the officers who answered the call
said she wasn't putting it on;

67
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:26,154
that she genuinely was very
frightened.

68
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:28,194
What does she do, this lady?

69
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,594
She's the village school teacher.

70
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:34,594
Oh, Connie. Connie Bishop.
Yes, the Mrs Barnaby knows her.

71
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:38,474
Well, I've always taken her for a
very serious, sensible young woman.

72
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:44,514
Well, there's no sign of a forced
entry. Windows shut, back door
locked.

73
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:46,994
She kept a spare key under a flower
pot, though.

74
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,674
And who knew about that?
Only half the village.

75
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:51,554
Only half the village. Yeah.

76
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,394
CONNIE: And twisting!

77
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:09,594

please? Listen to Jacqueline.

The building was donated by Harold
Frobisher 60 years ago.

82
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,554
About last night...
Ah.

83
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,474
I'm afraid I may be wasting your
time.

84
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,634
I think I must have been dreaming.

85
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,634
Well, let's hope you were.

86
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:39,034
Well, better that than having a real
intruder.

87
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:40,954
Well, yes, I suppose so.

88
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:44,314
The officers who attended the scene
said you were sure it wasn't a
dream.

89
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:48,554
Well, yes. I do remember waking up
and then hearing the noises.

90
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:52,594
The footsteps on the landing and
creaking floorboards.

91
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,794
But people do sometimes dream
they've woken up, don't they?

92
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,754
When they are, in fact, still
dreaming.

93
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:01,514
I can't think what else it could
have been.

94
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:05,794
I mean, I didn't think much about it
at the time, when Jim said the back
door was bolted.

95
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:09,314
Councillor Hanley, Neighbourhood
Watch man - one of the first on the
scene.

96
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:11,314
And all the windows were closed.

97
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:13,754
I was leaning out of my window,
calling for help.

98
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:16,674
I would have seen anybody escaping
through the front door.

99
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:18,834
So, there couldn't have been anybody
there.

100
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:22,954
Now, listen. I understand absolutely
what you're saying,

101
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:26,794
but just to be on the safe side, and
for your own peace of mind,

102
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:30,834
I think you should consider changing
the lock on the front door.

103
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,474
Really?
Really.

104
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:36,434
And you mustn't leave your spare key
under the flower pot.

105
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,954
Yes. Fair enough.

106
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:41,314
Now, this is my number.

107
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:44,194
And do not feel embarrassed to give
us a ring

108
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:47,154
the second you think you've got
another intruder. All right?

109
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:50,354
There you go. That should help you
sleep more easily.

110
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,674
You're very kind.
I'm sure there won't be anything.

111
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:59,514
Odds are she was imagining it.

112
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:02,274
But the fact that back door was
locked from the inside

113
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,994
doesn't rule out the possibility
there really was an intruder, does
it?

114
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:10,274
And if there was an intruder,
he could have left by that back door,

115
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:15,074
come in again with the others, locked
the back door from the inside before
anyone saw it,

116
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,754
to make it look as if no-one could
have left that way.

117
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:20,314
Hmm. Yeah.

118
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:23,634
Or just stayed in the house and
pretended to come in with the
others.

119
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,114
Yes.

120
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:29,674
Yes, I think we ought to keep an open
mind.

appointed in the first place.

124
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:42,474
I can't see her running it for much
longer. Can you?

125
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:45,794
Leaning out of windows in the middle
of the night, screaming?

it?

No, allowing her to continue as
Chairperson just wouldn't be fair to
her.

And did anyone tell Connie that the
meeting had been brought forward?

Zukie's suggesting that we hire an
all-weather marquee for Frobisher Night.

149
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:29,954
On the green.

150
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:34,554
And I really think a sizable chunk
of what we raise should go towards
the new hall this year.

Don't worry? Frobisher Night is
about trying to raise money,

not squander it away on expensive

155
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,594
Now, you mustn't get upset.

156
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:51,874
I'm not getting upset.

157
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:55,394
And we've always had Frobisher Night
at the hall.

158
00:11:55,394 --> 00:12:00,674
Darling, if we want to attract the
kind of people who are going to bid
serious money at the auctions,

159
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:04,194
then we've got to provide the kind
of venue in which they'll feel at
home.

160
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,554
Oh, dear.

161
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:10,834
You have been badly shaken, haven't
you?

162
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,714
I'm perfectly fine.

163
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:17,474
(CRYING) So stupid!

164
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:20,354
I'm sorry. (SOBS)

165
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:27,674
Ah, Jenny, tea. Perfectly timed.

166

(CONNIE GROANS)

167
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:34,954
It's not about raising extra cash
for good causes.

168
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,354
It's about raising her profile with
the local bigwigs.

169
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:40,914
The glitterati.

170
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:43,834
That's what ladies who lunch a lot
live for.

171
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,754
She's right about us needing a new
hall.

172
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:50,314
The school gets way, way too much of
the proceeds, anyway.

173
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:54,474
And if we're honest, there aren't
enough children to even justify it
being there.

174
00:12:55,634 --> 00:13:00,474
The school is the heart of the
village. And the children are the
future.

175
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,234
Feel a song coming on, Jim? (LAUGHS)

176
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:05,514
Oh, you can laugh.
We have to make a stand.

177
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:07,474
Somebody has to.

178
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:10,834
At the end.

179
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:13,074
Jim...!

180
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:15,394
What is it with him these days?
(DOOR CLOSES)

181
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:21,034
I told her we could stump up the
money for the deposit, but she just
wouldn't have it.

182
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,314
She has no vision.

183
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:26,074
And fewer and fewer people attend
each year.

184
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:28,594
And why people support her...

185
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:32,314
When you say 'we' can stump up the
money for the deposit...

186
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:36,114
Oh, I'm sorry, babes. I should have
mentioned it, but I didn't think
you'd mind.

187
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,874
It's only a few hundred.

You don't mind, do you, Howie?

You know how grateful I can be.

192
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:54,714

I let Mungo out.

I was only gone a minute.

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:36,829
And you think someone entered the
house during that time?

That's all I can think of.

Lettie.

Yeah?

body at the end of the garden, sir.

243

We thought she should warm up.
She was muddy and cold through from
the rain.

Is it true? It's Councillor Hanley?

257
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:14,509
Yes, it is.

258
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,789
I knew there was something wrong.
I knew it.

259
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:19,989
How did you know?
He was troubled.

260
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:24,269
He was very troubled. I should have
taken more notice, listened to him.

Sir, Mr Bullard's here.
Ah.

262
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:31,229
She can't stay here. I'm going to
take her back to our house.
She can come with us.

263
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,029
Yes, that's very good. We'll talk
again tomorrow.

00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:35,949
Yeah.

265
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:37,829
Excuse me.

266
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:42,469
Well, Tom, it was a very sharp
knife.

267
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,949
Used approximately one and a half
hours ago.

268
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:49,149
About the time the intruder was in
Connie's house.

269
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:51,789
Assuming there was one.

270
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:10,549
I still can't believe it's happened.
Terrible.

dog.

272
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:18,189
We always have Mungo when Connie's
at work.

273
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:21,469
Home from home, isn't it, boy?

274
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,309
He knows us pretty well now.

275
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:27,869
Now, Mrs Stroud... Oh, thank you.

276
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:31,149
You said last night you thought Jim
Hanley was 'troubled',

277
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,709
and you felt you should have listened
to him more.

278
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:36,149
Yes.

279
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:38,429
It was a conversation we had in the
pub.

280
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:40,629
This is the Black Swan?
Yes.

281
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:45,509
I was talking to him about the
Frobisher Committee.

282
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:48,229
Ah, Frobisher Night.
The dinner-dance thing?

283
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:53,749
Yes, and how I wished he hadn't
resigned the chairmanship.

284
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:57,749
And then he started talking about...?
Reputations and secrets.

285
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:02,589
He'd had a few drinks by then, so I
wasn't taking him too seriously.

286
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:08,429
'Something about how sometimes
secrets have to be revealed.'

287
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,549
Go on, Councillor - get it off your
chest. It's always best, you know.

288
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:14,389
(WEARILY) Easy for you to say.

289
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:18,069
Don't be such a drama queen.

290
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:22,909
Nah, nah, let the poor man drown his
sorrows. What are you having, Jim?

291
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:29,709
At the time, I thought it was just
Jim being his moody old self.

292
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:33,429
You knew the Councillor quite well?
40 years.

293
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:36,269
I served with him at the council for
20.

294
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:39,789
But I don't think I ever knew him
really well.

295
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:46,509
He was very polite and reasonable,
but there was always something in
reserve - you know?

296
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:50,509
Mrs Stroud, do you know why Jim
Hanley resigned from the Frobisher
Committee?

297
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:58,029
I know he didn't enjoy it as much as he 
used to, before Zukie and the rest joined.

298
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:04,509
We had to put up with them because
Zukie's husband has been so generous
over the years.

299
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,589
To the charity.

300
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:10,149
Poor man. She well and truly has got
her claws into him.

301
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,469
What about friends and family of the
Councillor?

302
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:16,029
Not really. Divorced years ago.
No children.

303
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:21,069
We were wondering whether the man I
saw outside Connie's house

304
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:22,989
might have anything to do with it.

305
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:28,469
You were the one who saw this man
acting suspiciously?

306
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:32,429
Yeah, he rushed off when he saw me.
Otherwise, I don't think I'd have
noticed.

307
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:34,989
So, what was he doing?
It was dark.

308
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:37,229
I didn't get a good look,

309
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:41,109
but it was in almost the same place
Jim Hanley was killed, so I just
wondered.

310
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,669
OK, that's it.
(BELL)

311
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:55,589
Inside.

312
00:24:57,989 --> 00:24:59,909
Thank you.

313
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,829
Hi.
Hi.

314
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:08,109
I thought I'd just... I heard about
last night. Sounds terrible.

315
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,189
Wasn't great.

316
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:13,149
Anyway, I just wanted to say, if
there's anything I could do...

317
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:16,949
I wanted to thank you for the other
night. I was just helping out.

318
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:20,709
I don't normally hang out of
windows, calling for young men to
come and rescue me!

319
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:22,109
(CHUCKLES)

320
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:24,509
I don't know what the women of the
village think of me.

321
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:27,229
Oh, well, we've all been there.

322
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:29,949
I mean...I didn't mean...

323
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:32,989
Because obviously, we...we haven't
erm...

324
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:36,629
Yeah... I think that's my phone.

325
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,669
Thank you, Justin.

326
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:03,469
(DOOR BELL)

327
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:16,709
Good morning. I'm Detective Chief
Inspector Barnaby from Causton CID,

328
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,149
and this is Detective Sergeant Jones.

329
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:21,429
We'd like to talk to Mrs Richardson,
please.

330
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:24,269
Come in.
Thank you.

331
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,989
This way.

332
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:41,309
ZUKIE: If we get the hall back in
proper condition, it's something the
whole community can use.

333
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:46,389
MAN: Let me think about it.
We're not talking about a huge
amount of money...

334
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:48,109
Mrs Richardson...
Just a minute.

335
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,509
It's far less than you donated to
the school.

336
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,949
That was money well spent.
Mrs Richardson?

337
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:54,829
(ANGRILY) Will you please...

338
00:26:56,189 --> 00:27:01,989
Inspector Barnaby, and Detective
er...Constable... Who was it?

339
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,869
Detective Sergeant Jones.

340
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:12,189
This must be about Councillor Hanley. Terrible thing.
-Thank you, Jenny. That'll be all.

341
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:15,949
Yes, it is about Councillor Hanley,
and we're talking to everyone that
knew him.

342
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:17,869
Of course.

343
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,909
Oh, this is my husband, Howard.

344
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,829
Mr Richardson.

345
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:26,389
Shocking. Please...

346
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:30,989
I really only knew him from the
Committee work.

347
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:34,309
He seemed a pleasant enough man.

348
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:37,789
Er...Mr Richardson, did you know him
at all?

349
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,429
Erm...nice man, I thought.

350
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,349
I can't imagine he had any enemies.

351
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:47,709
Wasn't anything to do with
Neighbourhood Watch, was it?

352
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,149
We just don't know, sir.

353
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,989
He was very fond of Connie, of
course.

354
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,109
'Very fond'?

355
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:58,869
Well, if I'm brutally honest, it
was...bordering on obsession.

356
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,069
Connie didn't mention it?

357
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:06,949
How did this erm...obsession manifest
itself?

358
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:09,709
Oh, body language.

359
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:13,109
He couldn't disguise it.
It was very odd.

360
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,589
Still, some people like needy types,
don't they?

361
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:19,069
Were you aware of it, sir -
this obsession?

362
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:23,429
I didn't see much of him, so I
couldn't really comment.

363
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,949
There's no question it had anything
to do with Connie?

364
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,629
We're not ruling anyone out or in at
this moment, sir.

365
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:35,149
Where were you both between 11:30 and
12:30 last night?

366
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,029
I was in bed with my husband.

367
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:40,069
We went up at about 11, didn't we,
Howard?

368
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:42,349
I came up a bit later.

369
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:44,509
You were already asleep, actually.

370
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:46,949
It must have been about 11:30.

371
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:56,789
And ten times five, William, is...?

372
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:59,349
Fifty.
Brilliant. Fifty.

373
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:01,109
Look!
(LAUGHTER)

374
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:11,469
Can you take over, please?
Listen to Jacqueline.

375
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:16,229
OK, shh. Next one. Who can tell me
eleven times five?

376
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:29,189
I was just passing, and I thought
I'd er...drop in and disrupt your
class for a bit.

377
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:33,309
Well, ten out of ten! No, it's about
that lock you needed changing.

378
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:38,029
I just wondered whether it's
convenient for me to pop round this
evening, take a look at it.

379
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,920
I'd say the Councillor had a bit of
a soft spot for Connie.

380
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,680
Not sure I'd say he was obsessive.

381
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,720
And his relationship with Zukie
Richardson?

382
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,680
He put up with her.
 Like we all do.

383
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,000
God knows what old Howard sees in
her.

384
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,680
No fool like an old fool.

385
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,920
His money inherited?
Oh, no. Started his own electronics
company. Retired now.

386
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,200
Is he involved in a lot of charities?

387
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,520
Yeah, but understated. You know?
Put a shed-load into the village
school.

388
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,200
They've got the building as long as
they want it now. All repairs and
upkeep taken care of.

389
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,960
Everything?
The whole lot.

390
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,400
Good evening.
I saw you at the school today.

391
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,680
Really? I didn't have you down as a
curtain-twitcher.

392
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,800
I hope you're not taking advantage of
Connie's vulnerable state.

393
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,480
She's asked me to go and take a look
at her front-door locks.

394
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,560
Not that it's any business of yours,
mate.

395
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,320
Is there a problem?

396
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,200
It's laughing boy who's got a
problem.

397
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,120
Just...just don't take advantage of
her.

398
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm going round to Connie's later to
sort out her locks...

399
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,480
as I think you suggested.

400
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,960
It's amazing, innit? You try and do
your bit to help.

401
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,800
All you get is sculptors abusing
you.

402
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,840
Keep it civil, gentlemen.

405
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,200
Oh, an extension.

406
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,120
You'd need a ladder to get into the
upstairs windows.

407
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,520
Yeah, it's fairly secluded,
if there was a ladder handy.

408
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,160
There are window locks.
I think they're OK.

409
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,400
I can get Laurence to have a look
when he comes.

410
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,960
That's a good idea.
What a lovely garden you have.

411
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,480
Thank you.

412
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,600
I see you've got a planning
application for an extension.

413
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,640
Would you lose a lot of the garden?

414
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,680
Quite a bit, sadly.

415
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,720
Assuming the permission comes
through.

416
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,560
Actually, I'm not sure it will now.

417
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,360
Jim was always positive about the
chances, but as he's gone...

418
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,480
Was he on the planning committee?

419
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,680
That's right. I hope that doesn't
make me sound callous.

420
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,000
No, of course it doesn't.

421
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,200
I'll miss him.
Hm.

422
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,960
Miss Bishop, we have to ask: do you
have a boyfriend at the moment?

423
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,000
No, I don't. And to be honest,
I can't really see the relevance.

424
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,240
We've heard that erm...Councillor
Hanley was interested in you...
romantically.

425
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,160
'Obsessed' was the word used.

426
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,880
That's ridiculous.
Jim was just a nice man.

427
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,000
We got on well. We were friends.

428
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,680
You didn't ever feel he was
attracted to you?

429
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,560
No. Not in that way.

430
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,280
And I think it says more about the
people making the accusation than
the person they're accusing.

431
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,120
I can probably make a wild stab at
who it might have been.

432
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,320
I think Connie could do with a bit
of company, now that she's back at
the cottage.

433
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,360
That's right. She'll be getting all
spooked over there on her own.

434
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,880
What about it, Justin? I'm sure
she'd be pleased with a bit of
company.

435
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,040
Play your cards right - you could
get your slippers under the bed

436
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,280
and get your old house back into the
bargain.

437
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,760
That's not funny, Vince.
Why not?

438
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,080
We all know you hated selling the
place.

439
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,120
You could have your cake and eat it
there.

440
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,560
Oh, I don't think our sculptor would
know his cake

441
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,920
if it jumped up and bit him on the
snout.

443
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,560
..I'm feeling a little bit peckish
myself.

444
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,360
Evenin', all.

445
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,600
How's Connie getting on, do you
think?

446
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Maybe you should ask her yourself.

447
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,360
If you care for her. Do you?

448
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,920
Course I do.

449
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,400
It's just, every time I get near her,
I start talking gibberish.

450
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,840
I'm all right until I get close to
her, and then some halfwit takes
control of my brain.

451
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,360
Oh, dear. You have got it bad,
haven't you?

452
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,880
But you know, it's not the end of
the world.

453
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,400
If someone's fond of you, they'll
put up with the occasional bouts of
drivel.

Well, that all seems secure enough.

When Justin had the house, he made
sure they did a good job.

457
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,600
Well, he may be all right with

I couldn't believe what he was
saying down at the pub just now.

459
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,280
What did he say? Well, he was going
on about how keen you were on him.

460
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,240
'Gagging for it' was the charming
phrase he used.

461
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,760
I know. I always thought he was OK.

462
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,880
But that wasn't the worst of it, I'm
afraid.

463
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,920
He said he might hitch up with you,

464
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,920
because he might end up living in
his old house again.

465
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,560
'Having his cake and eating it' was
the way he put it.

466
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,240
Amazing how wrong you can be about
people, isn't it?

467
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,080
But then again, maybe it was just
his idea of a joke. I don't know.

468
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,280
Mmm. Now, this is the lock you want
fixed - yeah?

469
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,160
Yeah.

470
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,080
The marquee's booked.
It's going to be fabulous.

471
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,960
Oh, hello, darling.

472
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,240
Zukie. How lovely to see you.
Coming to Frobisher Night?

473
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,560
Frobisher Night? When's that?

474
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,600
Oh, you must come!

475
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,760
It's going to be totally different
this year.

476
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,040
We've got an all-weather marquee on
the green, fantastic caterers,

477
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,400
a top DJ person.

478
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,760
Nothing at all like previous years.
You must come.

479
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,640
Well, I...
Leave it with me.

480
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,320
I'll drop the tickets round.
Say no more. See you there.

481
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,200
OK, thanks.

482
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,280
Zukie! All the tickets are gone.

483
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,840
I'll sort something out.

484
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,440
She's just the kind of person we
need.

485
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,120
Morning.
Oh...absolutely fine.

486
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,320
I'm really enjoying living in my
lovely cottage.

487
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,200
I didn't realise you liked it quite
that much.

488
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,800
Sorry? I've never 'gagged' for
anything in my life!

489
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,360
He was chairperson.
Considered a bit of a tough nut, was
Councillor Hanley,

490
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,080
when it came to planning
applications. Why do you ask?

491
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,000
Well, I was wondering about the
planning application for Connie
Bishop's house.

492
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,840
Ah, the extension.
What's the situation there?

493
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,560
Oh, it has every chance of going
through.

494
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,280
Jim had actually told me, off the
record, that he thoroughly approved.

495
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,040
Connie's sister and the three
children are moving in.

496
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Er...a bad divorce, and it was all
very difficult, I think.

497
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,680
Pretty much homeless.

498
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Jim was very pleased at the idea of
more children in the village.

499
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,960
Bolster the school numbers.

500
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,360
We've heard the relation between Jim
Hanley and Connie Bishop described
as...an obsession.

501
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,840
Obsession? No.

502
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,040
Mildly infatuated, possibly.

503
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,120
In an 'older man, younger woman'
kind of a way.

504
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,600
But he would never have done
anything.

505
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,160
Oh, Mrs Richardson.
Ah, I've caught you in.

506
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,040
Excellent.

507
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,560
What a lovely garden you have.

508
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,520
Oh, thank you.
Well, we do try to keep it nice...

509
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,880
Yes. Erm...I wanted to ask you a
favour, Jean.

510
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,960
Well, if we can help in any way...
Oh, it's Mrs Richardson.

511
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,040
Hello there. Lovely day.

512
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,120
Yes. I was wondering about your
tickets for Frobisher Night.

513
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,000
I wondered whether you might give
them up this year.

514
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,680
Give them up?

515
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,880
Oh, but we go every year.

516
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Yes, well, that's rather the point.

517
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,400
We wondered if you might give
somebody else a chance this time
around.

518
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,760
Have you actually ever bought
anything at the auction?

519
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,120
Well...we got that sirloin of beef
that time. Didn't we, Ted?

520
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,960
That's right.

521
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,160
Yes, well, a sirloin of beef isn't
really what it's about this year.

522
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,040
We do have some lavish and
extraordinary lots.

523
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,600
So, if you don't feel you can
realistically contribute,

524
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,200
you might want to give somebody else
a chance.

525
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,080
Have you got them handy?

526
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,720
There we are. All done.

527
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,600
CONNIE: Thank you!

528
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,200
Would you like me to be a key-holder
for the spare?

529
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,520
Might be a little bit safer than
where it was before.

530
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,600
Or someone else. Just...don't leave
it under the flower pot.

531
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,440
No, no. You keep it. Thanks.

Do you know, I could just do with a

way, too.

as the one used on Councillor
Hanley.

569

doesn't take much effort to cut a
throat.

clumsy play to stay the night.

stay in the summer house, so I...

Well, who was it?
He didn't say.

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,760
He just said he knew who it was.

598
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,280
Connie, what did he say, exactly?

599
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,800
I'd been going on about how people
in the village thought I was crazy,

600
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,360
and half of them probably thought
I'd killed Jim Hanley,

601
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,240
and he said he knew I hadn't.

602
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,440
I said it was sweet of him to say
so, but he couldn't really be sure,

603
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,360
and he got sort of irritated and
said...

604
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,360
he knew I hadn't done it, because he
knew who had.

605
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,320
I told him he should tell the
police.

606
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,720
I said he could be in danger, if he
knew who it was.

607
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,920
And then he said he didn't mean it.

608
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,560
That he'd been joking.

609
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,600
But he wasn't joking.
I know he wasn't.

610
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,560
How did you know?

611
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,840
Because he asked me not to mention
it to anyone.

612
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,120
And you don't say that if you've
been joking.

613
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,480
And he gave no clue at all as to who
he thought the murderer was?

614
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,360
No. No, he didn't.

615
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,680
Did you tell anyone about this?
Did you make any phone calls?

616
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,320
No.
I've only just remembered myself.

617
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:10,155
What do you think, sir?
Is she telling the truth?

618
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:14,955
You remember Mrs Stroud going on
about Jim Hanley in the pub,

619
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:17,035
talking about secrets and
reputations?

620
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:21,915
Well, Laurence was there too, and I
wonder if Laurence got the Councillor
to explain

621
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:23,795
who he was talking about.

622
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:40,795
The thing I hate most about all of
this is how suspicious it makes you
of everyone.

623
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:44,835
I just...I can't trust anyone.

624
00:48:46,115 --> 00:48:48,915
I'm not even sure if I trust myself
any more.

625
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:51,475
Sometimes I think I'm going mad.

626
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:53,275
MRS STROUD:
You're bound to feel wobbly.

627
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:55,195
I can't believe what Justin said.

628
00:48:56,555 --> 00:48:58,475
I thought he was OK.

629
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:01,155
Now I find out he's a complete...

630
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:04,475
How could he?

631
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,395
What are you talking about?

632
00:49:07,995 --> 00:49:11,155
You didn't hear what he said in the
pub?

633
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:14,555
Apparently, he was telling everyone
he thought he'd get hitched up with
me,

634
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:16,955
so he could get his old house back,

635
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:20,195
and how it would be easy, because I
was 'gagging for it'.

636
00:49:20,195 --> 00:49:24,595
Justin didn't say that.
Who told you? Was it Laurence?

637
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:28,795
He was there.
I know he was there. So was I.

638
00:49:28,795 --> 00:49:32,075
Laurence and Vince were winding
Justin up.

639
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:35,435
They were the ones talking about him
having his cake and eating it.

640
00:49:35,435 --> 00:49:38,475
Justin was actually defending you.

641
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,755
Defending me?
Well, of course he was.

642
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:47,395
Wasn't Justin upset at what Vince
said about getting his shoes under
Connie's bed?

643
00:49:47,395 --> 00:49:49,835
Yes, he was. Definitely.
See?

644
00:49:49,835 --> 00:49:51,755
Nice cup of tea?
Oh, thank you.

645
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:56,435
I don't like to speak ill of the
dead, but that swine Laurence

646
00:49:56,435 --> 00:50:00,195
must have been trying to put you off
Justin to give himself a better
chance.

647
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:03,635
Justin loves you.
You must know that.

648
00:50:04,795 --> 00:50:07,595
He doesn't?
Of course he does.

649
00:50:07,595 --> 00:50:09,555
He's mad about you. Isn't he,
Imogen?

650
00:50:09,555 --> 00:50:12,435
He is. It's just, he doesn't have
the courage to tell you.

651
00:50:13,795 --> 00:50:15,955
I was so rude to him outside the
shop today.

652
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:17,835
Oh, he'll get over it.

653
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,235
And what's he going to think about
last night?

654
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:25,395
Talk to him. Explain what happened.

655
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:31,315
Everything's going to be all right.

656
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,035
Come on!

657
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,875
(DOOR CLOSES)

658
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:47,075
JONES: So, if what Connie said was
true...

659
00:50:48,515 --> 00:50:52,555
..Laurence may have been killed to
stop him revealing who the murderer
was.

660
00:50:52,555 --> 00:50:55,635
But why here? And why last night?

661
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,555
And how did the killer know Laurence
would be in the summer house?

662
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,995
At half-past one in the morning.

663
00:51:00,995 --> 00:51:05,115
Could it have been the lurker...
from a couple of weeks ago?

664
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:08,195
Back again. Happened to see them.

665
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:11,595
Well, if it was the lurker who was
the killer...

666
00:51:12,995 --> 00:51:16,515
..that means our besotted Councillor
Jim Hanley was not.

667
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:20,795
I think it's time to talk to the wise
man of the village.

668
00:51:20,795 --> 00:51:22,515
(CAR HORN)

669
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:25,275
ZUKIE: I'm just relieved we took
over when we did.

670
00:51:25,275 --> 00:51:27,875
Connie's obviously in no state to do
anything now.

671
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:31,515
We're not cancelling Frobisher
Night? Absolutely not!

672
00:51:31,515 --> 00:51:33,635
Deposits have been taken.
MAN: Come on!

673
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:40,635
Oh, and I've managed to get
commitments from two more local
celebrities and an Honourable.

674
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:43,035
Wonderful! I'll see you.
See you.

675
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,555
MAN: About time.

676
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:04,155
Do you think, Vince, that the
er...the lurker...

677
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:06,555
was someone local?

678
00:52:06,555 --> 00:52:09,475
It was a bit odd, old Jim Hanley
being found there.

679
00:52:10,235 --> 00:52:12,795
In the same spot where Imogen saw
the Peeping Tom.

680
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:18,995
Do you think Jim Hanley was, you
know, that way inclined?

681
00:52:18,995 --> 00:52:22,795
Well, there were pointed comments
from his wife before they divorced.

682
00:52:22,795 --> 00:52:26,555
She definitely gave the impression
that he was one of life's voyeurs.

683
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:32,235
Being a Peeping Tom is pretty
reprehensible behaviour,

684
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:34,595
but having your throat cut seems a
bit extreme.

685
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:39,795
I don't think we should jump to any
conclusions about the motive just
yet.

686
00:52:53,915 --> 00:52:58,835
I think there's something you should
know. It's not definitely
suspicious, but it was a bit odd.

687
00:52:58,835 --> 00:53:01,275
In the circumstances.

688
00:53:01,275 --> 00:53:03,435
Yes, go on.

689
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:05,955
It was yesterday, just here.

690
00:53:05,955 --> 00:53:09,875
I saw Connie talking to Justin,
and they had words.
She was very off with him.

691
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:13,675
Anyway, it was all because of a lie
that Laurence told.

692
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:18,315
Saying Justin was only interested in
Connie because he wanted to get his
old house back.

693
00:53:18,315 --> 00:53:21,115
'His old house'?
Yeah, where Connie lives now.

694
00:53:22,555 --> 00:53:25,035
Two years ago, when Justin split up
with Claire...

695
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,075
That's his ex. Lovely girl. Didn't
deserve her.

696
00:53:28,075 --> 00:53:30,995
..they had to sell the house, and
Connie bought it.

697
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:33,795
Anyway, I was thinking...

698
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:37,235
if Justin found out what Laurence
had been saying about him,

699
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:39,115
he wouldn't be too pleased.

700
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:46,035
No, I was never too keen on
Laurence, but that was not a nice
way to go.

701
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,595
Darts team will miss him.

702
00:53:49,595 --> 00:53:51,955
Pushed his luck, though, with his
womanising.

703
00:53:51,955 --> 00:53:55,555
Hmm. That's true. There'll be one or
two people out there with motives.

704
00:53:58,755 --> 00:54:00,635
Not mentioning any names.

705
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:04,235
Yeah, but he's got to be on their
list, though, hasn't he?

706
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:06,115
What with his being smitten by
Connie,

707
00:54:06,115 --> 00:54:08,835
and Laurence trying to muscle in on
the two of them.

708
00:54:08,835 --> 00:54:11,515
I'm not saying he's the murdering
kind, of course.

709
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,595
Very decent of you, Vince.
Thank you(!)

710
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:17,915
Mind you, I'm not so sure you could
say the same about the subject of
his affections.

711
00:54:17,915 --> 00:54:20,435
Definitely a troubled soul, our
Connie.

712
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:22,595
What with her nightmares and
sleepwalking

713
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:24,675
and screams in the middle of the
night.

714
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,915
Who knows what's going on inside
that head of hers?

715
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,755
Connie's the gentlest of people.

716
00:54:28,755 --> 00:54:30,995
Absolutely. Lovely person.

717
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:33,435
I'm sure you're right.

718
00:54:33,435 --> 00:54:38,715
But it's worth bearing in mind that
anyone who's shown any amorous
interest in her so far

719
00:54:38,715 --> 00:54:40,795
has ended up with 
their throat cut.

720
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:45,755
I'm going off this pub.

721
00:54:49,435 --> 00:54:52,915
Oh! I thought I might find you here.

722
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,635
Hello.
Oh, sorry. Do you want to go in?

723
00:54:55,635 --> 00:54:57,955
Actually, Justin, it was you I
wanted to talk to.

724
00:54:57,955 --> 00:55:00,115
Oh. Shall we...?

725
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:04,675
So, er...how have you been getting
on?

726
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:07,515
Well, I'm staying at Mrs Stroud's,
but it's not ideal.

727
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:09,755
I've decided to go back to the
cottage tomorrow.

728
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:11,675
The police should be finished by
then.

729
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,075
Are you sure you'll be all right
there on your own?

730
00:55:14,075 --> 00:55:15,995
Well, that's why I wanted to talk to
you.

731
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:20,715
You know you said, if there was
anything you could do for me, to
just ask?

732
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:22,275
Yeah.

733
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:25,315
I wondered if you might come over
for supper tomorrow.

734
00:55:25,315 --> 00:55:29,555
I think I'm gonna find the evenings
a bit difficult, and I could do with
the company.

735
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:33,115
If you're not doing anything.

736
00:55:33,115 --> 00:55:35,315
No, no, of course. I'd love to.

737
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:38,435
Oh, great. About 7:30?

738
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,355
Great.

739
00:55:40,355 --> 00:55:42,235
See you then.

740
00:55:51,155 --> 00:55:53,395
And the entrance here, I think.

741
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:56,875
Excellent. Good.

742
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:00,155
Excuse me.

743
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:04,835
I think it's going to be fabulous!
I just pray there isn't another
murder.

744
00:56:04,835 --> 00:56:06,915
Well, they say bad things come in
threes.

745
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:12,395
You know, Jane, sometimes you can be
very negative.

746
00:56:12,395 --> 00:56:14,435
(HORN BLARING)

747
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:16,355
Not there!

748
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:25,555
I didn't particularly like Laurence.
Actually, I positively disliked him.

749
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:27,435
Ah. And why's that?

750
00:56:28,915 --> 00:56:33,475
He was a liar, full of himself,
rude. The list goes on.

751
00:56:33,475 --> 00:56:36,275
And you didn't like him flirting
with Connie?

752
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:39,435
She should have had more sense than
to have anything to do with him.

753
00:56:39,435 --> 00:56:41,435
How long have you known Connie?

754
00:56:41,435 --> 00:56:44,795
Erm...I met her when I was showing
her round the cottage.

755
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:47,475
You lived there with your ex-wife,
didn't you?

756
00:56:47,475 --> 00:56:49,355
Girlfriend.
What happened there?

757
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:51,955
She walked out on me.

758

we had to sell.

Not great. They went out with each
other for a couple of years,

Oh, Justin...

915
01:08:30,218 --> 01:08:32,138
It's me you should be arresting.

916

Yes.

918

I'm the one who should be locked up.

919

For my sake and for everyone else's.

920
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:57,418
No. Look, you were sleepwalking.

921
01:08:58,298 --> 01:09:02,938
You woke up in what you thought was
a threatening situation and you
lashed out.

922
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:06,098
I do not think that is an
imprisonable offence.

923
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,738
But you don't...

924
01:09:08,738 --> 01:09:12,858
You don't know what you've done when
you've been sleepwalking, do you?

925
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:17,218
And you don't always know whether or
not you've been sleepwalking when
you wake up.

926
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:19,578
You're talking about the murders,
aren't you?

927
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:25,578
You know I said I had a dream the
night Laurence was killed?

928
01:09:27,818 --> 01:09:29,698
Well, I didn't tell you everything.

929
01:09:31,858 --> 01:09:34,138
When I looked down at my hand, in
the dream...

930
01:09:36,898 --> 01:09:38,818
..I was holding a knife.

931
01:09:40,778 --> 01:09:43,418
And I heard a voice, inside my
head...

932
01:09:46,058 --> 01:09:47,978
..saying, 'Kill him'...

933
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:51,418
..over and over.

934
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:55,058
And the night Jim Hanley died...

935
01:09:56,178 --> 01:09:58,058
..and I found the back door open...

936
01:09:59,538 --> 01:10:04,858
(SNIFFLING) ..I think there were
muddy boot prints by the back door.

937
01:10:07,298 --> 01:10:09,218
My sort of size.

938
01:10:11,298 --> 01:10:13,698
And they got smeared with all the
coming and going

939
01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:15,898
of the police and everything.

940
01:10:15,898 --> 01:10:17,938
But I don't know how they got there.

941
01:10:20,218 --> 01:10:22,338
I know I should have mentioned it
before.

942
01:10:23,738 --> 01:10:25,658
I'm sorry.

943
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:30,898
So, you think you put on your boots
in your sleep...

944
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:34,698
..went outside, killed someone,

945
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,618
in your sleep?

946
01:10:40,338 --> 01:10:42,218
Homicidal somnambulism.

947
01:10:43,498 --> 01:10:47,498
I don't believe in that, Connie, and
I don't believe you should, either.

948
01:10:47,498 --> 01:10:50,458
But were there any traces of blood on
you?

949
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,458
On your hands or anywhere?

950
01:10:56,058 --> 01:10:58,338
I had a shower.
Oh, yeah.

951
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:02,778
I didn't do it on purpose or
anything.

952
01:11:02,778 --> 01:11:06,578
I was just all muddy and wet,
and I needed to warm up.

953
01:11:08,218 --> 01:11:11,178

would have been washed away.

the one

who slit the throats of our two

What on earth put that idea into her
head?

965
01:11:50,058 --> 01:11:52,538
Well, she says she's a regular
sleepwalker,

966
01:11:52,538 --> 01:11:55,098
and she had a dream on the night of
the second murder,

967
01:11:55,098 --> 01:11:57,338
where she's holding this knife,

968
01:11:57,338 --> 01:12:01,338
while a voice inside her head kept
saying, 'Kill him, kill him.'

But I can't believe that Connie
Bishop is our killer. Can you?

01:12:07,058 --> 01:12:09,418
Anyway, she wanted to be in a prison
cell tonight.

971
01:12:09,418 --> 01:12:12,418
For her own protection and everyone
else's, she said.

972
01:12:12,418 --> 01:12:15,858
So, that's what we've done,
to err on the side of caution.

973

Do you want to turn out the light?

Oh, I'm really going to drop off
easily now(!)

975
01:12:24,498 --> 01:12:29,698
Of course, sleepwalking can be used
as a valid defence against a murder
charge.

Don't tempt me.

Well, she was talking about booking
in for another night tonight,
so I said we'd play it by ear.

01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,026
Got a bit of interesting news,
though.

989
01:14:05,026 --> 01:14:08,426
I've just been talking to Justin's
ex, Claire, on the phone.

990
01:14:08,426 --> 01:14:12,786
Imogen contacted her after we'd seen
her, and explained how we're trying
to get hold of her.

991
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:15,066
So, they did keep in touch.
Yeah.

992
01:14:15,066 --> 01:14:19,226
Anyway, Claire says Justin wasn't
violent at all during their
relationship.

993
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:21,266
If anything, he was too nice.

994

So, there goes your 'body under the
patio' theory.

995
01:14:24,706 --> 01:14:27,466
Yeah.
But there is something.

996
01:14:27,466 --> 01:14:29,906
Something about this house.

997
01:14:29,906 --> 01:14:32,826
It all revolves around this house.

998
01:14:33,946 --> 01:14:35,826
Come on.

999
01:14:40,586 --> 01:14:44,426
Murder one on the pathway at the
bottom of Connie's garden.

1000
01:14:44,426 --> 01:14:46,946
Murder two in the summer house.

1001
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:49,826
Laurence's death.

1002
01:14:50,906 --> 01:14:54,786
Let's assume for a moment, shall we,
that Connie was telling us the truth?

1003
01:14:56,106 --> 01:14:59,906
Laurence told Connie that he knew
the identity of the murderer.

1004
01:14:59,906 --> 01:15:02,066
But he didn't tell her the name.

1005
01:15:02,066 --> 01:15:04,666
She told him to tell the police,

1006
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,906
because knowing the identity of the
murderer meant

1007
01:15:07,906 --> 01:15:11,666
that he might be in danger himself,
from the murderer.

1008
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:16,186
But Laurence said that the murderer
didn't know that he knew.

1009
01:15:17,506 --> 01:15:21,266
Perhaps Laurence was blackmailing
them...anonymously.

1010
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,466
Yeah. Yes.

1011
01:15:23,466 --> 01:15:25,346
And that's probably the best
explanation

1012
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:27,986
for why he didn't tell the police.

1013
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:30,786
And then he's killed.
Murdered in his sleep.

1014
01:15:32,306 --> 01:15:35,506
Cold-blooded, premeditated murder.

1015
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,146
As if whoever did it

1016
01:15:39,146 --> 01:15:41,706
wanted to prevent their identity from
being revealed...

(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING)

1018

..or just to get shot of a
blackmailer.

1019
01:15:46,426 --> 01:15:49,466
But how or when did they realise it
was Laurence?

1020
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:53,946
Laurence was virtually passing out

1021
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:56,186
when Connie put him to bed in the
summer house.

1022
01:15:56,186 --> 01:15:58,666
He couldn't have talked to anyone.

1023
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,706
And Connie said that she didn't,
either.

1024
01:16:01,546 --> 01:16:04,346
So, the murderer knew that
Laurence knew who they were,

1025
01:16:04,346 --> 01:16:09,306
which also means the murderer would
have known it was Laurence who was
blackmailing them.

1026
01:16:09,306 --> 01:16:14,146
Yeah. But why wait until Laurence
comes up here to Connie's cottage?

1027
01:16:14,146 --> 01:16:16,066
Wouldn't that make it more risky?

1028
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:18,226
I mean, why not kill him as soon as
they knew?

Yeah.

wipe it clean and missed a bit.

01:19:50,067 --> 01:19:52,027

1066
01:19:52,027 --> 01:19:55,147
Well, I might have to tie you down
to the bed, but...! (LAUGHS)

1067

1069
01:20:40,347 --> 01:20:42,267
Well, he said he'd be here.

1070

1071

Yes, sir.

1072

Yes, please.
Lovely.

1073
01:21:53,147 --> 01:21:56,667
What about Connie's fingerprints on
the knife?

1074
01:21:56,667 --> 01:22:00,987
Well, if the killer could get into
Connie's cottage while she was
asleep,

1075
01:22:00,987 --> 01:22:03,947
he could have pressed the knife
handle onto her fingers.

1076
01:22:03,947 --> 01:22:06,267
She'd been drinking, had a bottle or
two.

1077
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:10,267
The killer knew she wouldn't wake up
easily. Could even have triggered the
dream.

01:22:10,267 --> 01:22:12,107
(BLEEPING)

1079
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:18,227
I didn't mention it earlier, because
I thought the killer might, you
know, be listening in.

1080
01:22:18,227 --> 01:22:22,427
Didn't see any harm in suggesting
that Connie was our chief suspect.

1081
01:22:22,427 --> 01:22:25,027
Lull him into a false sense of
security.

1082
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:30,147
But if it wasn't Connie, how did the
murderer get into the cottage after
killing Laurence?

1083
01:22:30,147 --> 01:22:32,267
She'd just had her locks changed.

1084
01:22:32,267 --> 01:22:36,507
I've spoken to Connie. Apparently,
she gave the spare key to Laurence
for safe-keeping.

1085
01:22:36,507 --> 01:22:38,467
But I've also spoken to Georgie
Bullard.

1086
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:40,347
No sign of any key on the body.

1087
01:22:41,427 --> 01:22:44,147
I think the killer took the key to
get into this house.

1088
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:47,507
Ahh.

1089
01:22:47,507 --> 01:22:51,147
I believe our murderer was listening
in,

1090
01:22:51,147 --> 01:22:53,667
when Laurence volunteered to become a
key-holder.

1091

Connie, why were you so stubborn
about keeping the school open?

This is about the school?
Yes.

Howard wanted the school to close,
so the ownership would revert to him.

Mr Hanley...

What? Oh, yeah.

1171
01:29:34,587 --> 01:29:38,427
Which is ironic, because Howard
himself was blackmailed later on.

1172

Jim Hanley, you see, was the Peeping
Tom,

1175
01:29:55,187 --> 01:29:59,427
Howard knew that if the council
granted Connie planning permission
for the extension,

1176
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:02,147
and Connie's sister moved back in
with her three kids,

1177
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,907
then that school could go on
for one, two years, at least.

1178
01:30:05,907 --> 01:30:08,707
But Howard needed that school to
fail,

1179
01:30:08,707 --> 01:30:12,987
so he'd get back possession of the
building...and sell it.

But the good Councillor was not for
bribing.

I've decided to grant planning
permission, so you can do your
worst.

what you saw that night,

1183
01:30:25,187 --> 01:30:29,227

to...to blackmail me...

tried, so as not to upset her
sister.
