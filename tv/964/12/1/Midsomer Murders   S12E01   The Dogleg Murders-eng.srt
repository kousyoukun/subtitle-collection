2
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:38,087
Like this.

3
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:06,513
Like this?

4
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:19,513
Yeah.

5
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,473
That's better.

00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:51,713
Good boy.

9
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,833
I gave Becky Tunstall
a lesson today, Mum.

10
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,873
I know. I'm so pleased.
She's a lovely girl.

11
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:06,313
Can I ask her out?
Not yet. Not till I say so.

12
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:10,873
You and Becky Tunstall,
you make a lovely couple.

13
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:30,593
Take it out the back, Colin.

14
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:34,593
Put it away safe and sound.
I haven't finished.

15
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,713
Do as you're told, this minute.

16
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,713
(LAUGHS)

17
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,833
Stop that, Colin! Stop it!

18
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,993
Do you want a good thrashing?
Do you? No, Mum.

19
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:08,193
Then get on with your chores.

(SNORTS)

21
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,513
This used to be the library,
you know,

22
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:15,673
till your father ripped
out all the book cases.

23
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:19,873
Yes, Martin.
I've heard that story more than once.

24
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:25,113
By the way, I've noticed there's
a loose tile up on the west gable.

25
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,233
Grandad always worried
about that roof.

26
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:31,393
Well, you can attend to it
when you buy the house.

27
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:33,313
If you buy the damn house.

28
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,793
I only need a couple more days.

29
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:42,513
Well, that's all you've got,
before the asking price goes up.

30
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:44,833
Again.

31
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,073
I'm gonna have to get
all the muck off these beams.

32
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,793
That's going to be job number one.

33
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:51,473
Bully for you.
Well, I'm off to play golf.

34
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,393
See yourself out.

35
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,713
You know the way, don't you?

36
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,873
I'll see you at the club, Will.

37
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:06,593
Won't be long now.

38
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:23,913
No.

39
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,513
I found it in the spare room.
No.

40
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:30,553
Oh, come on, Tom. It was good fun
when we used to play tennis.

41
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:34,313
No, it was not.
Rose-tinted spectacles there, Joyce.

44
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:45,153
the small matter of me arresting the
treasurer for murdering his mistress.

45
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:47,113
Details. Details.

46
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,913
We've got to keep active, Tom.

47
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:50,233
Why?

48
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,073
What about waking?
Muddy boots.

49
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,113
Swimming.
Chlorine. Disgusting.

50
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:56,633
How about golf?

51
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,513
Oh, you must be joking.

52
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:00,953
(SIGHS) I give up.

53
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:05,833
Good. Hey, Joyce, what about
those tennis shorts you used to wear?

54
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,793
Have you still got them?

55
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:33,353
Good morning, Captain.
Good morning, Captain.

56
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:20,353
Do you know what the time is, Kemp?

57
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:23,393
Do you mind? I'm trying to hole out.

58
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:27,313
Village members should
be off the course by midday.

59
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,113
I reckon your watch must be fast.

60
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:33,953
It's not even five to yet.
Don't worry, Mr Kingslake,
this is our last hole.

61
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:36,113
Well, make sure it is.

62
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:38,913
Ruddy yokels
cluttering up the course.

63
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:43,313
Oh, come on, Kingslake.
They're only here half a day a week.

64
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,073
Ooh!

65
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,913
I don't like Kemp's manner.

66
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:51,993
He's a trouble maker.

67
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,953
He gives us a jolly good discount
at that garage of his.

68
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,713
I'd rather pay the full whack

69
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:59,113
and not have his ugly mug
cluttering up the course.

70
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:02,233
Well, I prefer Kemp
to that jumped-up beggar Claypole.

71
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,913
God, yes, any day.

72
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:09,473
Go on, then, Drinkwater.

73
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,873
Rumour has it that Claypole
is angling for full membership.

74
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:18,953
Over my dead body.

75
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:23,313
But not chance of it with you three
on the Membership Committee, eh?

76
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:25,153
You know the form, Jerry.

77
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:28,713
Can't discuss membership matters
outside the committee room.

78
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,233
They're just a pain
in the ruddy arse.

80

Oh, put the thing out of its misery,
Drinkwater, for pity's sake.

81
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,953
(LAUGHS) Sliced it.

00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,073
Damn!

84
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:54,353
Ali, you really should be quiet
when someone's making his stroke.

85
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,313
Oh, don't be so wet.

86
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:59,273
A ton says he won't get
out of there in one.

87
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,113
200 says I will.

88
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:04,233
OK.

89
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:08,409
How about three?

90
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,129
I'll tell you what...
let's make it five.

91
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,689
For heaven's sake, you two.

92
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,889
A demi-grand, it is.

93
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,969
Oh, yes.

94
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,409
Route one, chaps.

95
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:48,133
A ton says I get up and down in two.
Any takers?

96
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,253
Not me, Ali.
Me neither.

97
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,453
You big girls' blouses.

98
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,293
Rebecca!

99
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,853
Rebecca, come here this minute.
And you...

100
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,853
you go back to the pro shop now.

101
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,893
Yes, sir.

102
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:18,853
What? I pay for you
to have lessons with the pro

103
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,413
and not with the steward's son.

104
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:24,013
Clyde didn't turn up, so -
I don't care.

105
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:27,573
You are not to associate with
that boy. Do you understand?

106
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,173
Associate (?)
What do you mean, associate?

107
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:33,013
You know very well what I mean.

108
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:41,373
Martin, you have got to do
something about Clyde Patchett.

109
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,453
Come in, Will.

110
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:46,853
I turn up today and find my daughter
being taught

111
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,493
by that...ghastly Fountain boy.

112
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:52,093
Actually,
Darren isn't a bad little player.

113
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:55,093
He's not even the assistant pro.
He's the damned steward's son.

114
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:57,813
And where is Patchett, anyway?

115
00:12:57,813 --> 00:13:00,333
He'll be in later.
He's got a touch of flu, I think.

116
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,253
The kind you catch from a bottle?

117
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,653
Now, listen, Martin,
you are the captain of this club.

118
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:08,333
Either you do something
about Patchett, or I will.

119
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,613
Ali, your ball's over here.

120
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:30,173
What's the matter, Kingslake?
Don't you trust me?

121
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:07,853
For crying out loud!

122
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,933
Mum says you're late.

123
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,413
All right, but she'll have
to wait till tomorrow.

124
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:20,853
Hey!

125
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:23,453
What the hell's going on?

126
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:26,293
Out in one, Kingslake.
You owe me 500.

127
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:27,973
That's impossible.

128
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,933
Are you accusing me of cheating?

129
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,413
He played it out fair and square,
Mr Kingslake.

130
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:40,813
Oh, yeah?
And what's it got to do with you?

131
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,293
What are you doing on the course
at this time of day, anyway?

132
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,213
Broken sprinkler on the eighth.

133
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:50,293
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
this is the 12th.

134
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:51,853
So shove off.

135
00:14:56,893 --> 00:15:00,253
Course, you'll give me a chance
to win my money back. Of course.

136
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:05,293
A grand on Crisp's Folly, then.

137
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:08,093
A grand, it is.

138
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:18,493
Are you all right, old chap?
Yeah...

139
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,133
Never better.

140
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,599
Only a grand, Drinkwater.
No pressure.

141
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,319
Let the man, play, Ali.

142
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,565
Oh, nice one, Jer.

143
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,485
Don't count your chickens,
Drinkwater.

144
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:33,645
Anything can happen
on Crisp's Folly.

145
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:52,045
Ho ho ho! Yes!

146
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:54,445
Route one!

147
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:57,565
Gentlemen, I am on a roll!

148
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,645
Well, where the hell's my ball?

149
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:12,925
Like you said, Kingslake,
anything can happen on Crisp's Folly.

150
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:14,885
Must have had a bad bounce, Ali.

151
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:17,885
No point looking for it, Ali.
Might as well go back to the tee.

152
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,845
I hit it straight down the middle!

153
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,133
Right.

154
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,399
You want some? Right?

155
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,279
Do you?

156
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,399
Because I'm ready if you are.

157
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,919
Kingslake?

158
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,799
How the hell did that get there?

159
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,079
I hope you're not going to say your
ball was on the fairway all the time.

160
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,639
For God's sake, Kingslake,
what are you doing?

161
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,679
(BREATHES SHALLOWLY)

162
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,639

00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:17,516
You idiot.
Are you trying to kill me? Sorry.

165
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,476
I've got a bone to pick with you.

166
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,956
Oh, really?
About him.

167
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,036
Giving my daughter lessons
instead of you.

168
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:29,276
Well, the thing is, I must have
picked up a spot of food poisoning.

169
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,196
Now what?
Something terrible's happened!

170
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:43,556
(PANTS) Some... Someone...

171
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,356
S-Someone's...

172
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:49,156
Someone's what, Ed?

173
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,676
Someone has killed Ali Kingslake.

174
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:07,436
Multiple heads wounds, Tom.
Vicious stuff.

175
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:09,436
Done with that club?

176
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,796
Probably. Won't know for sure
until we've got him on the slab.

177
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:17,196
Beaten to death with a one iron.
What a way to go.

178
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:21,276
This hole was famous, you know.

179
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:24,516
I played it once.
I got a quadruple bogey.

180
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,396
It's known as Crisp's Folly.

181
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:28,916
Crisp's what?
Folly.

182
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,676
A chap called Crisp lost his house
on a bet playing this hole.

183
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:35,316
It's got a 90-degree dogleg,
you see.

184
00:21:35,316 --> 00:21:37,796
You take a driver from the tee,
you end up in the jungle.

185
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,836
With an iron, you may not
get a shot at the green.

186
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:42,276
Well, that's absolutely fascinating,
George,

187
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:44,876
but I don't speak golf.

188
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,676
Where's Jones got to?

189
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:14,629
That's where the momentum...
That's where the momentum comes in.

190
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:17,789
Time for golf, have we?
Ah...sir.

191
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,669
This is Martin Crisp, club captain.

192
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:23,749
And Will Tunstall, president.

193
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:26,429
Dreadful business, Chief Inspector.

194
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,909
Rest assured that we at Whiteoaks
will do everything we can

195
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:31,709
to assist with the investigation.

196
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:34,909
I think you should know that we've
had problems on this hole before.

197
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:37,189
Problems?
Vandalism. Loutish behaviour.

198
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,509
You see, there's a public footpath
goes across the fairway.

199
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,549
It's a damned nuisance.

200
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,109
What is that?
Periscope, sir.

201
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:49,269
So people using the footpath can
check if anyone's on the 13th tee.

202
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:53,429
Health and safety is always
a priority at Whiteoaks.

203
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:56,149
Mr Crisp, is that
the Crisp of Crisp's Folly?

204
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:01,269
Yes, it was my grandfather,
the black sheep of the family.

205
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,309
As you probably know,
John Cotton is a member here,

206
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,589
so lines of communication
will be first rate.

207
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,909
John Cotton?

208
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,749
Your Chief Superintendent,
Inspector.

209
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:16,989
Yes... Well, thank you, gentlemen,
That'll be all for now.

210
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:19,069
We'll talk to you again, of course.

211
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,749
Thank you.

212
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:21,709
Thanks.

213
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:26,229
Since when has Johnny Cotton
been Chief Superintendent, eh?

214
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:28,069
Last week.

215
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,869
You should read your emails.

216
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,669
I can't. The computer's broke.

217
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:41,949
What's this?

218
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:43,749
Kingslake's ball, sir.

219
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:45,469
Is it?

220
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:48,869
If Kingslake's ball was here,
what was he doing in there?

221
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:51,109
Hacking it out probably. Mind you,

222
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:53,949
he'd need a miracle shot
to get to here from in there.

223
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:58,269
So Kingslake disappears
into the undergrowth,

224
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,469
and one of his mates goes looking
for him, yeah?

225
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:02,909
A man called Drinkwater
found the body.

226
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,949
He says he saw someone
fleeing the scene.

227
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:07,269
Any description?
No.

228
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:09,269
Just a flash of someone
in a blue hoodie.

229
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:12,709
Oh, a hoodie? Ho ho ho.
That's perfect, isn't it?

230
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:17,029
Local thug attempts robbery.
Respectable citizen resists.

231
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:20,149
Thug beats respectable citizen
to death with his own clubs.

232
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:21,949
How convenient is that?

233
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:23,629
Maybe that's what happened, sir.

234
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,629
Yeah, well,
I'm not holding my breath.

235
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:28,909
Let's go talk
to some of these golfers.

236
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:52,357
Well, we were playing the 13th,
Crisp's Folly,

237
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:57,757
and Ali creamed it off the tee.
Absolutely mullered it.

238
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:02,877
But when we got on the fairway, lo
and behold, no sign of Ali's ball.

239
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:06,277
So Mr Kingslake's ball must have
gone into the...into the...

240
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:07,917
Rough.
..rough.

241
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:12,557
Well, on Crisp's Folly, you've
got jungle either side of you.

242
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:16,197
There's not much point in looking
for it. Might as well reload.

243
00:25:16,197 --> 00:25:18,717
Reload? Go back to the tee
and play a new ball.

244
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,117
But Ali charged off into the trees.

245
00:25:22,117 --> 00:25:27,037
To look for his ball?
Well...yes. Suppose so.

246
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:30,397
And you went to help him...
Yes, I...

247
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:34,397
Er...I mean...no.

248
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:36,877
Which exactly?

249
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:42,717
Well, no because his ball
was there on the fairway.

250
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:45,837
But you just said
there was no sign of it.

251
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,557
At first, yes.

252
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:54,197
But then he... Then he obviously
found it and played out.

253
00:25:57,717 --> 00:26:00,517
So Mr Kingslake's ball reappeared...

254
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,357
but he didn't.

255
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:04,917
Yes, that's right, so..

256
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:08,597
Ahem. I... So you went in to see
if he was all right, didn't you?

257
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:10,397
Yes.

258
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:13,197
That's right.
I was a little concerned.

259
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,037
There had been incidents
in the past.

260
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:19,157
Were these incidents
reported to the police?

261
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:21,437
I'm really not sure.

262
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:24,197
No idea.

263
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:30,477
So, Mr Drinkwater, you went in to see
if Mr Kingslake was all right and...?

264
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:33,597
Yes. There he was.

265
00:26:33,597 --> 00:26:36,557
Just lying there.

266
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:39,557
I thought maybe he was ill
or something.

267
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:43,197
Then I saw the blood and the ...

268
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:48,437
And then I heard a noise
in the wood

269
00:26:48,437 --> 00:26:53,517
and saw this...this chap
running away.

270
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:58,277
But you can't describe this chap,
Mr Drinkwater.

271
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:01,757
Not really.
I didn't see his face or anything.

272
00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:04,357
He was wearing one of those...
hooded things.

273
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:07,837
Bright blue. Ghastly colour.

274
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:09,557
And until you played the 13th,

275
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:11,557
it had been a game
much like any other, had it?

276
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:14,397
Nothing untoward, nothing unusual.

277
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:17,597
No. Nothing at all.
All perfectly normal.

278
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:20,637
I...

279
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:22,557
Mr Tully?

280
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:25,477
Nothing.

281
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:32,837
Ali did have words with some village
members near the 12th tee. Hm.

282
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:34,597
Village members.

283
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:37,277
Residents are allowed to play
mornings on Wednesday mornings.

284
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:42,397
Thank you. Words? What kind of words?
It was nearly midday.

285
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:45,237
Ali thought it was time
they were off the course.

286
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:50,597
Would you mind if we rang for
a refill, Inspector? No, please.

287
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:55,317
(RINGS BELL)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

288
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:58,077
Large ones, please, Mrs Fountain.

289
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:00,077
Right away, Mr Monkberry.

290
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:09,957
He was a lovely man,
was Mr Kingslake.

291
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:12,797
A lovely man.
I'm sure he was, Mrs...

292
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:15,117
Fountain. Eileen Fountain.

293
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:16,837
Mrs Fountain's the steward here.

294
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:20,317
I've been working here 30 years.
We've never had anything like this.

295
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:22,557
All right, Mrs Fountain. That'll do.

296
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:29,357
We're gonna have to talk
to these village members.

297
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:32,597
Mr Kemp and Mr Claypole.

298
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:36,157
You won't be able to talk
to them here, Inspector. No.

299
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:38,597
Village members are not allowed
in the club house, sir.

300
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:40,277
You'll find them in the cooler.

301
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:41,997
The cooler?

302
00:28:41,997 --> 00:28:45,757
The shed behind the car park, sir,
for the use of village members.

303
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:10,623
There's something
that lot aren't telling us.

304
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,343
I agree, sir.

305
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:15,103
Get Forensics to check
their golf clubs, all of 'em.

306
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:16,863
Yes, sir.

307
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:23,743
Look, Jones.

308
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:26,863
There seems to be an assault
taking place.

309
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:29,183
They're brothers, believe it or not.

310
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:32,463
Are they? Mrs Fountain's boys,
the steward we met.

311
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:35,263
One's the green keeper,
the other works in the pro shop.

312
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:37,223
Want to interview them now?

313
00:29:37,223 --> 00:29:40,023
No.
I'll save that pleasure for later.

314
00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:41,863
Where's this cooler?
It's round there.

315
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:57,318
Alistair Kingslake did a lot for
this club. He'll be sorely missed.

316
00:29:57,318 --> 00:30:00,598
Not by me he won't.
Steady on, Archie.

317
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:04,598
Inspector Barnaby wants the truth,
not the spin. Indeed, I do.

318
00:30:04,598 --> 00:30:08,158
Well, the truth is,
he was the rudest man I ever met.

319
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,391
When you met him on the course,
gentlemen, what happened?

320
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:25,631
We was on the 16th green,

321
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:27,711
next to the 12th tee,

322
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,551
It was coming up to midday.

323
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:31,791
Kingslake reckoned
we should be off the course.

324
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:43,029
He's forever trying to chuck us off.

325
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:46,749
Was. He's a stickler for the rules,
that's all.

326
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:48,589
Quite right, too.

327
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,829
That's what golf's all about.
Sticking to the rules.

328
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:54,069
Where were you this afternoon?

329
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:57,869
Giving Becky Tunstall a lesson.

330
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:02,469
What kind of lesson?
Good question, that.

331
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:07,749
Careful, Kemp. Or what?
You'll set your big brother on me?

332
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:10,229
Steady on, lads.
What will Inspector Barnaby think?

333
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:12,029
What kind of lesson?

334
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:13,629
Golf, of course.

335
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:17,989
So you're a professional.
(LAUGHS)

336
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:20,629
He works the pro shop
three days a week.

337
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,629
And I do some coaching.

338
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:25,309
Only when Clyde Patchett's
under the weather,

339
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:27,269
which is most days.

340
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:30,029
Did you play Crisp's Folly
this morning?

341
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,829
Yeah. About half-ten.

342
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:36,149
There have been incidents,
have there not,

343
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:38,029
at Crisp's Folly in the past?

344
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,349
Incidents?

345
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:46,949
Yeah. Confrontations with the local
hooligans, that sort of thing.

346
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:49,309
Only incidents on Crisp's Folly
are golfing incidents.

347
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:51,629
It's a beast of a hole.

348
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,219
Ever get the feeling
you're not wanted?

349
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,979
You're imagining things.

350
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:12,939
(TOOTS HORN)

351
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:20,339
(TOOTS HORN)

352
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:26,859
We need to talk.

353
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:28,819
Follow me.

354
00:32:50,907 --> 00:32:52,827
500 quid.

355
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:56,307
And you didn't hear it from me,
all right?

356
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,867
So Alistair Kingslake
bet Jerry Drinkwater

357
00:32:58,867 --> 00:33:02,507
that he couldn't get out
of this bunker with one stroke?

358
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:05,507
That's right, and...

359
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:07,707
And? And what, Mr Tully?

360
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:11,907
Well, Jerry jumped into the bunker
and the next thing we knew...

361
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,827
his ball was out of the sand
and right on the green.

362
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,467
It was a pretty miraculous shot,
to be quite honest.

363
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:23,307
Ali certainly thought so. They...

364
00:33:23,307 --> 00:33:27,867
There was brief discussion,
shall we say?

365
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:30,107
Did Mr Kingslake accuse him
of cheating?

366
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,467
Well, it came pretty close,
I can tell you.

367
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:35,347
Then Colin Fountain popped up

368
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,427
and said he saw Jerry play out
fair and square.

369
00:33:37,427 --> 00:33:39,107
So that was that.

370
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:40,787
The green keeper?

371
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:42,627
Yes, he was lurking about.

372
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:46,587
Anyway, the whole thing seemed
to upset Jerry no end.

373
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:51,987
Then he bet Ali ã1,000
on Crisp's Folly.

374
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:54,267
What?
ã1,000?

375
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:57,707
Look, a certain amount of gambling
goes on at Whiteoaks.

376
00:33:57,707 --> 00:33:59,267
Always has done.

377
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:02,987
No doubt Ali Kingslake can afford
to lose a grand here and there,
but I can't.

378
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:05,187
And Jerry Drinkwater -
can he afford it?

379
00:34:05,187 --> 00:34:07,147
I really couldn't say.

380
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:14,347
So, Mr Tully...

381
00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:22,187
..we have Kingslake and Drinkwater
playing Crisp's Folly for ã1,000.

382
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:25,667
Kingslake clouts his ball
into the wood.

383
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:29,667
He goes in after it
and suddenly out it pops.

384
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:33,707
So it would seem.
Another miraculous shot.

385
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:36,547
I suppose so, yes.

386
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:40,227
Mr Tully, do you think
that Kingslake cheated?

387
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:45,907
Play the ball as it lies,
play the course as you find it,

388
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:48,907
and if you can't do either -
Do what is fair.

389
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:54,267
Exactly. That's the spirit of golf.

390
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:57,227
And very much the spirit of
Whiteoaks, I'd like to think.

391
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:59,627
Mr Tully?

392
00:34:59,627 --> 00:35:02,747
You haven't answered my question.

393
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:08,587
If you really want to know a man,
Inspector, play golf with him.

394
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,987
Ali had a temper, it's true,

395
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,187
and his social skills
may have been lacking,

396
00:35:14,187 --> 00:35:16,867
particularly when dealing with
people he regarded as his,

397
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,547
how shall I put it -
social inferiors -

398
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:24,107
but he was a man
of complete integrity.

399
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:29,107
So there.

400
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:32,507
Right, what have we got?

401
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,627
An argument over a bet.
Yeah.

402
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:37,707
Drinkwater cheats his way
out of a bunker on the 12th hole.

403
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:41,187
They double the bet. Kingslake gets
his own back by cheating on the 13th.

404
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:43,547
Drinkwater confronts him
in the wood.

405
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:47,187
They fight and Drinkwater
beats Kingslake to death.

406
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,507
Then he makes up this story
about someone in a blue track suit.

407
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:52,387
Both of them cheated.

408
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:54,587
It seems unlikely.
What?

409
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:57,787
Golf being the last bastion of fair
play? Something like that, yeah.

410
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:59,987
Yeah, well... Well, whatever.

411
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:04,467
Drinkwater's still got a lot
of explaining to do. Hey, look...

412
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:06,467
we need a map of the golf course.

413
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:10,107
I need to know where that footpath
goes to in both directions,
where the road is,

414
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:13,347
and, Jones, could you get hold
of the local news media?

415
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:15,467
This has got to be worth
an appeal, hasn't it?

416
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:19,187
You know, someone somewhere must
know something. You know the form.

417
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:25,187
And those incidents on the 13th hole
- see if they were ever reported.

418
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:27,067
Anything else?

419
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:29,907
Well, if all that's a bit
too much for you, Jones,

420
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:33,227
you could always call
on the widow yourself.

421
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:35,827
No, thanks.

422
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:40,467
Are you familiar with the expression
'golf widow', Inspector?

423
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:43,147
Er, yes. Well, no.
Erm...I have heard it used.

424
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:46,907
He played golf every day,
rain or shine.

425
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:49,627
Then there were
the committee meetings.

426
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,627
And the bar afterwards, of course.

427
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:56,587
So I'm used to being alone, you see.
I've had lots of practice.

428
00:36:56,587 --> 00:37:01,027
May I ask, your late husband
and Jerry Drinkwater -

429
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:04,227
were they erm...very good friends?

430
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:09,747
Well, Ali enjoyed bullying him.

431
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:11,747
And Jerry put up with it.

432
00:37:11,747 --> 00:37:14,987
Maybe that passes for friendship
in male circles.

433
00:37:14,987 --> 00:37:18,387
What about Miles Tully
and Ed Monkberry?

434
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:22,107
Actually, he's seen more of those
two in the last couple of months.

435
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:25,867
The three of them would spend hours
on the putting green,

436
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:28,187
banging on about some crisis
at the club.

437
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:29,827
Crisis? What crisis?

438
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:33,867
How would I know? Golf chatter
was banned in my presence.

That was our last summer
at Pellings.

Worked himself into an early grave,

He saw it as his duty.

00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:26,667
Well, it goes on.

475
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,187
I've always tried to impose
some sort of rule,

476
00:39:29,187 --> 00:39:31,427
but there's always
stiff opposition.

477
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:35,427
The view is that it's a private
matter between members.

478
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:38,067
If it doesn't impinge
on other members, then...

479
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:41,307
If Alistair Kingslake was killed
because of a bet...

480
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,747
..would that qualify as impinging?

481
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:53,667
Are you saying...
Jerry Drinkwater killed Ali?

482
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:57,027
Well, sir, I have to consider
all the possibilities.

483
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:04,507
I've played golf a couple
of times...with Janet Painter.

484
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:06,507
It's years ago. Do you remember?

485
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:08,267
No, I don't.

486
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:10,147
It was quite a good laugh.

487
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:12,227
We even had a lesson with the pro.

488
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,387
He said I had a natural swing.

489
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:17,187
A natural what?
Swing.

490
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:19,067
(LAUGHS)

491
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:23,627
Wait a minute. Did you say
it's called Whiteoaks?

492
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:26,547
I did. Well, that's the club
Derek and Janet joined.

493
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:29,187
It took them ages to get in.

494
00:40:29,187 --> 00:40:31,227
They were as pleased as punch.

495
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:35,347
They had to eat a 12-course dinner
as a kind of test.

496
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:38,267
You know, eat your soup
with your pudding spoon, you're out.

497
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:41,667
So the Painters are members
of the Whiteoaks club, are they?

498
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,987
Well, they were. It was all Janet
talked about for a while.

499
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:49,307
Then Derek had some work problems,
I think and they packed it in.

500
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:51,347
They play badminton now.

501
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:54,467

(CHOKES AND COUGHS) No, Joyce!

503
00:40:57,187 --> 00:41:00,427
Yes, I'd say he was hit
six or seven times.

504
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:02,227
Blows are consistent
with a golf club?

505
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,107
Yes, but...

506
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:05,987
Yes, but what, George?

507
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:08,187
All the blows pretty much landed
in the same place.

508
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:11,307
Good grouping, in fact.
The killer had a good eye.

509
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:13,227
Yes, good hand-eye co-ordination.

510
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:15,267
(MOBILE RINGS)
It made it damned difficult

511
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,067
separating one wound from another.

512
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,307
But there's one
that's slightly off target.

513
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:21,147
And the angle's different.

514
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:25,187
Sir, it's Chief Superintendent
Cotton. Oh, not now.

515
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,707
He's in a...

516
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:31,507
Maybe that was the first hit.

517
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:34,347
He was on his feet at the time
and that would explain the angle.

518
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:35,827
Could be.

519
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,107
But there's something bothering me,
Tom, and I need a bit more time.

520
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:41,307
There's something bothering me too,
George.

521
00:41:41,307 --> 00:41:43,427
If you'd hit a ball into that wood,

522
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:45,707
would you have used a one iron
to get out of it?

523
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:47,467
Now you come to mention it, no.

524
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:49,787
No, you use a one iron off the tee
or on the fairway.

525
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:52,307
If at all. There's an old saying:

526
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:54,827
'If there's lightning about,
hold up a one iron.

527
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:58,027
'Even God can't hit a one iron.'

528
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,067
What's this?

529
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:05,787
I'm not sure,
but it wasn't from a golf club.

530
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:08,787
When he fell maybe.

531
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:11,507
No, the bruising's too small,
too symmetrical.

532
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:13,987
A punch...during the struggle.

533
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:15,947
No, it wasn't a fist.

534
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:19,147
But whatever it was,
it was sustained before the attack.

535
00:42:19,147 --> 00:42:21,907
Right, thank you, George.
Thanks very much.

536

Anything back from Forensics
about those golf clubs?

Not yet, sir, but I've got a map.

Stick a few pins in it.

Come on, Colin. You were there.

that Jerry Drinkwater

had played out of the bunker
fair and square.

No.

625
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:46,771
No. So why did you cover for him?

626
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:51,291
Mr Kingslake was a rude man.

627
00:49:52,611 --> 00:49:54,411
Oh, so you did it
to annoy Mr Kingslake?

Yeah.

629
00:49:57,371 --> 00:50:01,131
He was extremely annoyed.
It was funny.

630
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:05,571
I didn't like Mr Kingslake...

631
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:07,331
but I didn't kill him.

632
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:09,611
No, I don't think you did, Colin.

633
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,691
He's not gonna get her.

634
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:17,371
I'm sorry,
who's not going to get who?

635
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:19,491
My brother Darren.

636
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:24,251
Becky Tunstall
would never go out with him.

637
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:27,211
Would she?

638
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:30,451
I'm sorry, Colin.
I can't help you there.

639
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:44,691
Hello?

640
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:47,011
Mr Monkberry!

641
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,371
Mr Monkberry?

642
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:40,971
(BUSHES RUSTLE)

643
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:47,251
Hey! Hey, you!

644
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:54,971
Argh!

645
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:15,571
Look out, man!

646
00:52:15,571 --> 00:52:17,371
Did you see him?

647
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:19,811
Who?
A man in blue.

648
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:25,091
A man in blue
fleeing the scene of a crime.

649
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:27,291
DS Jones, isn't it?

650
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:30,931
(BREATHLESS) Oh...hello, sir.

651
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:32,651
What on earth is going on, Sergeant?

652
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:34,291
Well, there's a dead body...

653
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:37,011
sir. (PANTS)

654
00:52:38,131 --> 00:52:40,251
Multiple stab wounds to the abdomen,
Tom.

655
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:43,811
And no cuts on his hands or his arms?
No.

656
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:47,451
No defensive wounds. The attack
took him by surprise, then.

657
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:49,531
No time to defend himself.

658
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:52,691
Or maybe he wasn't surprised
because he knew his assailant.

659
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:56,291
What was that he said to you?

660
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:58,291
He said he'd had an odd phone call.

661
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,051
The killer, do you think?

662
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,171
No sign of his mobile, I suppose.

663
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:05,451
No, no. Just his wallet.

664
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:08,171
There's no cash or credit cards
in it, though.

665
00:53:08,171 --> 00:53:12,771
So this person in the blue tracksuit
actually exists. Yes, indeed.

666
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:14,931
Spooky place.

667
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:18,171
Time was I'd have given my eye teeth
to be a member here.

668
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:22,171
I'll stick to Causton Municipal,
thank you very much. Me too.

669
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:26,491
Oh, the Chief Superintendent wants
to talk to us at the clubhouse, sir.

670
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:29,051
Well, the Chief Superintendent
will have to wait.

671
00:53:29,051 --> 00:53:31,371
I want to look at the 13th again.

672
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:45,051
So the killer must have known

673
00:53:45,051 --> 00:53:48,131
that Kingslake and his cronies
were on the course.

674
00:53:48,131 --> 00:53:51,051
He waits for them
to get to the 13th tee,

675
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:55,171
and when they do, he watches
them through that periscope.

676
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:57,691
So he knows who's hit which ball?

677
00:53:57,691 --> 00:54:00,211
Exactly. Now, he wants to lure
Kingslake into the woods.

678
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:02,931
But Kingslake hits a great shot
off the tee.

679
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:07,491
So the killer snaffles the ball
and then goes into the woods.

680
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:10,171
Why would Kingslake
bother looking for it?

681
00:54:10,171 --> 00:54:13,291
The ball could have gone anywhere.
You'd play another one off the tee.

682
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,251
Yeah, that's been bothering me too.

683
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:18,611
Maybe, Jones, maybe he didn't have
to look for a ball at all.

684
00:54:18,611 --> 00:54:20,651
Do you remember that bruise
on his forehead?

685
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:27,571
The ball was thrown at him.

686
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:30,091
Now, from what we know of Mr
Kingslake, there's only one way

687
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:32,371
he'd react to something like that,
isn't there?

688
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:35,651
Right.

689
00:54:36,131 --> 00:54:38,411
He grabs a club at random...
Hence the one iron.

690
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:40,891
..and heads off to confront
whoever chucked his ball.

691
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,051
He gets jumped,
has his club taken off him -

692
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:44,851
No, not necessarily, Jones.

693
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:46,571
Not necessarily.

694
00:54:46,571 --> 00:54:50,291
George Bullard is worried about one
of the blows to Kingslake's head.

695
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,971
I don't want to jump the gun,

696
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:54,131
but I reckon in a day or two
George will come to us

697
00:54:54,131 --> 00:54:57,331
and tell us that the blow was done
by a different club.

698
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,091
You want some?

699
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:02,371
Because I'm ready if you are.

700
00:55:08,691 --> 00:55:12,011
The subsequent blows were delivered
by Kingslake's club

701
00:55:12,011 --> 00:55:14,891
in order to disguise
or obscure the first blow.

702
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:17,771
(SQUELCHING)

703
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:21,171
Good hand-eye co-ordination,
says George Bullard.

704
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:23,931
He's a golfer, Jones.

705
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:27,091
A golfer.
That cheered you up, has it, sir?

706
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:30,691
Look, I know you think I've got
a prejudice against the golfers.

707
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:32,451
And I have.

708
00:55:32,451 --> 00:55:34,371
But I've put it to one side
for the moment.

709
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:37,411
The truth, Jones, is all I'm
interested in, I promise you.

710
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:40,211
Well, I'm sure that'll please
the Chief Superintendent.

711
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,331
Will you stop worrying
about the Chief Superintendent?

712
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:45,651
He's waiting for us
back at the club house.

713
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:47,451
Is he?
Yep. Oh.

714
00:55:47,451 --> 00:55:50,051
Now, of course, we can't be sure

715
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:54,371
until the pathologist
has completed his final examination.

716
00:55:54,371 --> 00:56:00,691
But it looks likely that Mr Kingslake
was struck by two golf clubs,

717
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,931
one of which might have belonged to,
or been in the possession of,

718
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:05,611
his assailant.

719
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:10,651
So this thug was wandering around
with a golf club?

720
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:14,411
I think Inspector Barnaby
is suggesting

721
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:17,731
the murderer is a member
of this club. Indeed I am, sir,

722
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:20,131
because that is a possibility.

723
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:22,771
A member? Ridiculous.

724
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:25,891
Drinkwater saw the murderer
running away.

725
00:56:25,891 --> 00:56:29,851
Monkberry was stabbed and had
his cash and credit card stolen.

726
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:33,971
Sergeant Jones saw the thug in the
blue track suit with his own eyes.

727
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:37,891
Gentlemen, Inspector Barnaby
will do everything in his power

728
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:41,171
to make sure that the club and its
members are treated with tact,

729
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:43,731
and discretion, isn't that right?

730
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:47,211
Tom?

731
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:50,611
Yes, yes, tact and discretion.

732
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:56,611
I think, John,
you might mention the possibility
of opening the front line.

733
00:56:56,611 --> 00:56:58,491
Yes, of course.
I don't see any reason

734
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:02,371
why the front line hole shouldn't
be open for play from Monday,
do you, Barnaby?

735
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:05,131
They're well away from the SOCs.

736
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:07,771
I'll be playing over at Chedgrave
Park for the time being.

737
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:10,171
I think it's best
if I keep my distance.

738
00:57:10,171 --> 00:57:12,811
I quite understand, John,
and thanks for all your help.

739
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,811
A word, Barnaby.

740
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:30,611
I would appreciate it, Barnaby,

741
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:32,611
if you would take my calls now
and then.

742
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:36,651
Yes, I'm sorry.
You know, it's been a bit...hectic.

743
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:38,531
Of course.

744
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:41,291
Of course. Do you play golf, Tom?

745
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,451
Perhaps you'd like to join me
at Chedgrave Park?

746
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:46,371
No, I do not play golf, John.

747
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:48,371
I always thought it
a bit unsporting,

748
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:50,451
you know, hitting a stationary ball.

749
00:57:51,571 --> 00:57:54,371
The more's the pity.
I play, sir.

750
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:57,091
I want a daily progress report.

751
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:05,411
I am disappointed in you.
It was worth a try.

752
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:07,491
Do you play?
Yeah.

But there was an assault on Crisp's
Folly a couple of years ago.

758
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:34,117
A bloke called Derek Painter
was attacked.

Derek Painter?
Yeah. Here's the interesting thing.

760
00:58:36,837 --> 00:58:38,717
The police were called
by Harry Claypole,

761

one of the village members.

762

Who has no recollection
of any incidents on the 13th hole.

He's here now, in the cooler.

He was up by the periscope

No, that was the thing. When I told
him, he got quite shirty.

785
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:30,807
Said there was no point
wasting their time

786
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:34,647
when he hadn't got a look at whoever
it was. OK, so the police arrive.

787
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:38,247
Yeah, they didn't speak to me.
They were only here five minutes.

788
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:40,687
Had a word with Mr Tunstall
and Mr Painter and left.

789
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:44,047
Mr Tunstall.
Yeah, he sorted it out.

790
01:00:44,047 --> 01:00:47,767
He was quite annoyed
about me phoning the police as well.

791
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:51,327
Very concerned about
the club's image, is Mr Tunstall.

792
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:57,847
Anyway, next time
I stayed well out of it.

793
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:01,167
Next time?

794
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:05,007
Er... Oh, nothing.

795
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:07,687
Mr Claypole.

796
01:01:09,447 --> 01:01:15,047
Well, Jerry Drinkwater was playing
Crisp's Folly last year.

797
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,767
He come out the rough
with a bloody nose.

798
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:20,567
Said he walked into a tree.

799
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:24,567
A few months after, Clyde Patchett
was found in a bunker,

800
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,607
doubled up, crying like a baby.

801
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:30,927
Caught himself in a sensitive
spot with his sand wedge, he said.

802
01:01:30,927 --> 01:01:34,567
Bit odd, though, him being
a professional, and so on.

803
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:39,007
Were either of the Fountain brothers
around at the times of these events?

804
01:01:39,007 --> 01:01:42,007
You're never far from a Fountain
at Whiteoaks.

805
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:46,527
The Fountains seem to be an
institution round here, don't they?

806
01:01:46,527 --> 01:01:48,767
Oh, yeah,
the wonderful Mrs Fountain.

807
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:50,887
The sun shines out of her,
all right.

808
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:53,447
As long as
there's no money involved.

809
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:55,247
Now, what can you mean by that?

810
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:59,807
That woman's so tight,
she squeaks when she walks.

811
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:03,007
I did some work for her.
Put a new concrete floor

812
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,407
in that damned pigsty of hers.

813
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:10,647
That was three years ago.
She still owes me half the money.

814
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:13,527
You should have told us about
the attack on Mr Painter before.

815
01:02:13,527 --> 01:02:16,727
Yeah, I know, I know,
but I didn't want to...

816
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:19,047
Didn't want to cause any trouble
for the club, did you?

817
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:25,567
Look, there's a captain's committee
meeting day after next.

818
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,407
They're proposing new members.

819
01:02:27,407 --> 01:02:30,967
The captain, Mr Crisp,
he's put me up for full membership.

820
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:33,687
I'd be the first village member
to become a full member.

821
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:36,607
Mr Crisp thinks it's about time

822
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:39,247
things were a bit more...
democratic around here.

823
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:41,087
Good for him.

824
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,807
He's a good bloke - Mr Crisp.
There's no side to him.

825
01:02:43,807 --> 01:02:47,967
He manages the White Lion Hotel
in Causton, you know.

826
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:50,847
You'll even find him serving
behind the bar when they're short.

827
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:53,607
So he understands people like me.
He's got a bit of respect.

828
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:57,647
Well, Mr Claypole,
I hope you succeed.

829
01:02:57,647 --> 01:02:59,847
They have to vote unanimously,
of course,

830
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:02,247
but I'm well liked around here.
I'm sure you are.

831
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:04,967
All I've got to get through then
is the president's dinner.

832
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:06,687
Bit of an ordeal, is it?

833
01:03:06,687 --> 01:03:09,967
Oh, yes. Curtains
if you pick up the wrong fork.

834
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:11,967
Like teeing off with your putter,
you're out.

835
01:03:16,407 --> 01:03:20,047
I'd be grateful if you didn't
discuss this membership thing
with anyone.

836
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:23,407
It's not done to discuss things
in public.

837
01:03:23,407 --> 01:03:27,927
Don't you worry, Mr Claypole. Your
secret is safe with us. Thank you.

838
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:30,647
We need to talk
to this Derek Painter bloke.

839
01:03:30,647 --> 01:03:32,527
I'll get his details
off the secretary.

840
01:03:32,527 --> 01:03:34,287
No need.
I know how to get hold of him.

841
01:03:34,287 --> 01:03:36,807
Derek Painter was a friend.
He used to be a member here.

842
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:38,687
But he packed it in rather suddenly.

843
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:41,287
Now, Jerry Drinkwater.

844
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:07,367
Never keep a car longer
than three years.

845
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:11,007
Depreciation's terrible.

846
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,167
Have you got a minute, please?
Er... Er...

847
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:17,367
Later would be better for me
or tomorrow.

848
01:04:17,367 --> 01:04:20,807
No, now, please, Mr Drinkwater.

849
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:24,167

851
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:33,647
Are you just moving in,
Mr Drinkwater, or moving out?

852
01:04:33,647 --> 01:04:35,567
Oh. Moving out.

(TURNS OFF MACHINE)

859
01:04:57,487 --> 01:04:59,567
My wife's a bit depressed
at the moment.

860
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,367
It's the move.

861
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:05,047
Mm. We want to talk about the day
Alistair Kingslake was killed.

862
01:05:05,047 --> 01:05:07,767
For God's sake, I've told you
everything. But you haven't, sir.

863
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:11,407
You didn't tell us about the bet
you had on with Alistair Kingslake.

864
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,327
Bet? What bet?

865
01:05:15,847 --> 01:05:19,247
Mr Drinkwater,
if I suspect from this moment on

866
01:05:19,247 --> 01:05:22,247
that you are telling me something
that is less than the complete truth,

867
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:25,287
Jones here will handcuff you,
take you to Causton Police station

868
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:28,087
and charge you with conspiracy
to pervert the course of justice.

869
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:29,687
Are we clear? Now, look -

870
01:05:29,687 --> 01:05:31,727
Are we clear about that?

871
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:37,447
OK, all right.

872
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:42,607
It was a few quid, that's all.

873
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:45,167
500.
If you say so.

874
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:48,007
And he accused you of cheating,
didn't he? As good as.

875
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:52,407
The nerve of the man. But you did
cheat, Mr Drinkwater, didn't you?

876
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,687
Now, just you hold your horses.
Just you hold on.

877
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:01,527
OK, all right.

878
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,847
I told him I'd got out of the bunker
in one.

879
01:06:05,847 --> 01:06:07,647
I'm ashamed to say it was a lie.

880
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:10,687
I've never done anything like that
before in my life. Never.

881
01:06:10,687 --> 01:06:13,207
But I was sick to death
of Kingslake's bullying,

882
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:16,247
sick of him bullying me
with his damned money.

883
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,647
So you doubled the bet
on Crisp's Folly.

884
01:06:20,007 --> 01:06:22,567
Yes. A grand.

885
01:06:22,567 --> 01:06:26,287
What an idiot. There was no way
I could pay him if I lost,

886
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:28,007
but if I won, well...

887
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:32,727
..the pleasure of taking
a thousand smackers off Kingslake...

888
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:35,847
That man hated losing, believe me.

889
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,527
So what happened?

890
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:42,767
His tee shot was in the trees.

891
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:44,687
Gone.

892
01:06:44,687 --> 01:06:48,287
The next thing I knew, there's his
ball in the middle of the fairway.

893
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:51,327
So you thought he'd cheated.
Yes, it was impossible.

894
01:06:51,327 --> 01:06:54,447
I went after him to tell him
what I thought of him.

895
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,367
There he was...lying there.

896
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:02,367
Body all twisted.

897
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:06,847
I didn't kill him, I swear
and I didn't kill Ed Monkberry.

898
01:07:06,847 --> 01:07:08,567
I know you didn't kill Ed Monkberry

899
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:11,767
because you were visiting
Eileen Fountain, Mr Drinkwater,

900
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:13,727
at the time, weren't you?

901
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:16,767
Was I?
Yes, you were.

902
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:18,767
Until you saw me.

903
01:07:18,767 --> 01:07:20,607
What were you doing there?

904
01:07:20,607 --> 01:07:25,927
Oh, catering committee stuff.

to lend me a small sum of money...

910
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:43,967
to tide me over.

911
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:45,847
I was paying her back.

912
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:49,167
You were borrowing money
from Eileen Fountain?

Well, I've known Mrs Fountain
for years.

914
01:07:51,727 --> 01:07:54,407
She's been very kind.

915
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:59,047
It was just to tide me over...
so I could keep on playing golf.

Yes, we did, absolutely.

That's the long and the short of it.

937
01:09:32,025 --> 01:09:34,665
The one thing that kept me
out of trouble was golf.

938
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:37,425
Until I joined Whiteoaks.

939
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:40,705
Does gambling go on up there?

940
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:43,225
Oh, it certainly does.

941
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:45,305
I was down a couple of grand

942
01:09:45,305 --> 01:09:48,585
with nothing
but change in my pocket.

943
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:51,665
So I was pointed in the direction
of someone who could help.

944
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:55,865
Was that someone,
by any chance, Eileen Fountain?

945
01:09:55,865 --> 01:09:58,465
That's right. The steward.

946
01:09:58,465 --> 01:10:01,785
Turns out
she's the club's unofficial banker.

947
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:04,305
Who pointed you in her direction?

948
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:07,065
Will Tunstall.
He was the one I owed money to.

949
01:10:08,185 --> 01:10:10,585
I should have listened
to Martin Crisp.

950
01:10:10,585 --> 01:10:12,745
You've probably heard his story.

951
01:10:12,745 --> 01:10:15,105
Losing that lovely house.

952
01:10:15,105 --> 01:10:18,305
Yes, after the membership committee
voted us in,

953
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:20,545
Martin Crisp took me to one side

954
01:10:20,545 --> 01:10:23,065
and warned me
about the gambling element.

955
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:26,385
So you borrowed money
from Eileen Fountain

956
01:10:26,385 --> 01:10:30,065
to pay off your gambling debts
to Will Tunstall.

957
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:32,105
Keeping it in the family,
he called it.

958
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:35,625
And I fell a couple of weeks behind
with the payments.

959
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:40,625
One day I find myself in the trees
on Crisp's Folly

960
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:46,185
and Colin, Eileen Fountain's
great lump of a son,

961
01:10:46,185 --> 01:10:48,265
looms out of nowhere

962
01:10:48,265 --> 01:10:51,185
and roughs me up.
What?

963
01:10:51,185 --> 01:10:53,785
Derek, you should have come to me.

964
01:10:53,785 --> 01:10:58,465
Anyway, we put our heads together
and managed to pay it all off.

965
01:10:58,465 --> 01:11:01,465
So, no more Whiteoaks for us.

966
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:03,825
Stick to badminton.
That's my advice.

967
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:43,385
What's it for?
Shut up, we're counting.

968
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:47,625
We're helping a friend, a very good
friend who will help us in return.

969
01:11:48,945 --> 01:11:51,785
But that's all we've got,
that's everything.

970
01:11:51,785 --> 01:11:53,625
Spread it thin, dad always said.

971
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:56,065
Shouldn't you be feeding a pig
or something?

972
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:03,985
She doesn't really like you.

973
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:08,385
She's just pretending.

974
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,825
She's just winding you up.

975
01:12:16,345 --> 01:12:18,385
Ugh!

976
01:12:18,385 --> 01:12:21,185
Stop it, both of you, this minute!

977
01:12:21,185 --> 01:12:22,985
I decide what's best
for this family.

978
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:25,025
Darren, get on with your work.
And, you...

979
01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:28,065
get out and don't come back
until you've calmed down.

980
01:12:42,505 --> 01:12:44,185
You aren't going to get her.

981
01:12:58,189 --> 01:13:00,229
Ah, the map.

982
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:01,949
Very nice.

983
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:06,349
Monkberry's body was found here,
sir, just off the footpath,

984
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:09,549
about 100 yards away
from where Kingslake was found.

985
01:13:09,549 --> 01:13:11,709
And the assaults
on Drinkwater and Painter?

986
01:13:11,709 --> 01:13:14,029
Here, sir,
where Kingslake was found.

987
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:18,829
And Clyde Patchett's alleged groin
injury occurred in this bunker here.

988
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:20,669
Ah, Crisp's Folly again.

989
01:13:20,669 --> 01:13:24,349
Right, so, Painter
and Drinkwater assaulted here.

990
01:13:24,349 --> 01:13:26,589
Yes, thank you, Jones.
Been there, done that.

991
01:13:26,589 --> 01:13:28,869
What did Miles Tully
have to say for himself?

992
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:31,669
He said the meetings
at Kingslake's house

993
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:34,069
were about the membership committee.

994
01:13:34,069 --> 01:13:38,509
They were worried about candidates
that Martin Crisp is putting up
like that Claypole bloke.

995
01:13:38,509 --> 01:13:42,229
(POSH VOICE) Not our sort of chap,
don't you know?

996
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:44,989
Transpires, Jones,
that Eileen Fountain runs

997
01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:47,869
a very, very lucrative
money-lending operation.

998
01:13:47,869 --> 01:13:49,829
Well, well.

999
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:51,829
That nice Mrs Fountain.

1000
01:13:51,829 --> 01:13:54,069
That nice Mrs Fountain.

1001
01:13:54,069 --> 01:13:57,109
Painter borrowed a couple of grand
from her at extortionate rates

1002
01:13:57,109 --> 01:14:00,589
to cover his losses
and so did Jerry Drinkwater.

1003
01:14:00,589 --> 01:14:03,749
And heaven knows how may others.
Offering loans without a licence.

1004
01:14:03,749 --> 01:14:07,109
Consumer Credit Act, 1974.

1005
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,909
And Colin found him.
He strong-arms those people

1006
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:12,549
who fall behind with their payments.

1007
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,909
Well, that's extortion.
Let's pull 'em in.

1008
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,629
No. Let them be for the minute,

1009
01:14:16,629 --> 01:14:19,429
while we work out the connection
with those two murders.

1010
01:14:19,429 --> 01:14:23,629
Is there a connection?
I mean, Kingslake had money.

1011
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:26,549
He didn't need any loans
and Monkberry wasn't a gambler.

1012
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:29,789
So we could still be looking
for a local bad boy.

1013
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:32,189
There's got to be a connection,
Jones.

1014
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:35,149
Will Tunstall, it was,
who delivered Derek painter

1015
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:38,069
into the delicate clutches
of Eileen Fountain.

1016
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:43,749
So let's go ask him why the
president of Whiteoaks Golf Club

1017
01:14:43,749 --> 01:14:45,709
touts for a loan shark?

1018
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:51,789
Yeah.

1019
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:57,029
Have you got the money?

1020
01:14:57,029 --> 01:14:59,029
I'll have the money
by the end of the day.

1021
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:01,189
I've heard all that before.

1022
01:15:01,189 --> 01:15:03,749
I had the money six months ago
and you put the price up.

1023
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:07,189
Because you took so long about it
and the market went up.

1024
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:11,149
Do you expect me to sell you an
asset at less than the market price?

1025
01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:14,029
Dad, that policeman's here.

1026
01:15:14,029 --> 01:15:17,949
Well, actually,
this isn't terribly convenient.

1027
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:20,029
It'll only take a minute.

1028
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,349
I'm off to the club for a lesson,
dad.

1029
01:15:24,349 --> 01:15:26,229
Who with?

1030
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:28,069
Don't get stressed.

1031
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:30,549
It's with Clyde, OK?

1032
01:15:33,349 --> 01:15:37,029
Well, I'd better be getting along.
No, no, Mr Crisp.

1033
01:15:37,029 --> 01:15:40,069
Stay where you are.
I'd like you to hear this too.

1034
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:43,429
Have you caught the murderer,
Inspector?

1035
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:46,669
No, this concerns Eileen Fountain.

1036
01:15:46,669 --> 01:15:51,389
It is alleged that she's been lending
money to members of Whiteoaks.

1037
01:15:51,389 --> 01:15:54,629
Well, if Eileen wants to lend people
a few quid here and there,

1038
01:15:54,629 --> 01:15:56,629
surely that's her business.

1039
01:15:56,629 --> 01:15:59,149
Colin's been using force
to extract repayments.

1040
01:15:59,149 --> 01:16:03,069
Now, did either of you
know about this? Certainly not.

1041
01:16:03,069 --> 01:16:06,269
Mr Tunstall?
No, of course not.

1042
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:09,669
Mr Crisp, thank you.

1043
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:12,669
I'd like to talk to Mr Tunstall
alone now, please.

1044
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:16,389
Yes, well, I have a committee
meeting to prepare for.

1045
01:16:17,509 --> 01:16:19,349
Gambling, Will...

1046
01:16:19,349 --> 01:16:22,709
that's what's brought us
to this sorry state.

1047
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:25,749
You and me, both.

1048
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:29,109
Spare me the sermonising, Martin.

1049
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:31,029
And, Martin?
What?

1050
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:39,909
So, you don't know anything
about Mrs Fountain's money lending?

1051
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:42,909
Am I missing something here?

1052
01:16:42,909 --> 01:16:46,829
Never mind Mrs Fountain.
Two men have been murdered.

1053
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:48,789
Two damned good friends of mine.

1054
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:51,909
We have a witness who said you did.
He claims you recommended her.

1055
01:16:51,909 --> 01:16:55,229
That makes you an accomplice,
Mr Tunstall.

1056
01:16:55,229 --> 01:16:58,869
That's outrageous. You wait till my
friend John Cotton hears about this.

1057
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:03,349
I'll be reporting it to the Chief
Superintendent later on today, sir,

1058
01:17:03,349 --> 01:17:06,629
so it won't be a very long wait.

1059
01:17:06,629 --> 01:17:10,509
Somewhere along the line, someone
got their wires crossed. Perhaps.

1060
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:13,549
Perhaps I didn't fully take on -
Mr Tunstall, thank you very much.

1061
01:17:13,549 --> 01:17:15,469
That will be all for the time being.

1062
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:18,669
Get hold of George Bullard.
I want to talk to him right away.

1063
01:17:18,669 --> 01:17:20,429
Sir?

1064
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:35,229
Oi!

1065
01:17:36,309 --> 01:17:37,549
Ha ha ha!

1066
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:39,309
Sometimes I love this job.

1067
01:17:39,309 --> 01:17:42,989
Tom, I've had a bit of a
breakthrough. You know I was worried

1068
01:17:42,989 --> 01:17:46,149
about those blows to Kingslake's
head? Two different clubs.

1069
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:47,509
Yes...

1070
01:17:47,509 --> 01:17:50,349
That's right.
Do you know what sort yet?

1071
01:17:50,349 --> 01:17:53,469
There's something about the injuries
I'm still trying to work out.

1072
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:56,109
If I may humbly suggest, George,

1073
01:17:56,109 --> 01:17:57,989
take a look at Monkberry here.

1074
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:03,749
Six stab wounds to the right side
of the abdomen. George...

1075
01:18:03,749 --> 01:18:05,989
Six stab wounds to the right side.

1076
01:18:05,989 --> 01:18:09,509
(LAUGHS) Of course.

1077
01:18:09,509 --> 01:18:11,669
Oh, damn! Damn!

1078
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:13,829
I don't get it.

1079
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:16,589
The murderer was left-handed.

1080
01:18:16,589 --> 01:18:19,989
The first blow to Kingslake's head
was with a left-handed golf club.

1081
01:18:19,989 --> 01:18:22,549
Which means the shape
of the indentation was reversed.

1082
01:18:22,549 --> 01:18:24,349
That's what confused me.

1083
01:18:24,349 --> 01:18:27,229
So we're looking
for a left-handed golfer.

1084
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:30,069
Yeah. There can't be that many
at Whiteoaks.

1085
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:32,629
Well, there is one
that springs to mind.

1086
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:34,589
Oh, and Martin?

1087
01:18:36,309 --> 01:18:38,229
Martin Crisp. He's a leftie.

1088
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:42,429
Crisp? Remember that impromptu
lesson you had on the 13th fairway?

1089
01:18:50,149 --> 01:18:52,109
See, we've been looking
at the gambling

1090
01:18:52,109 --> 01:18:54,149
and we should have been looking
at a house.

1091
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:56,589
The house Crisp's grandfather
lost in a bet?

1092
01:18:56,589 --> 01:19:00,309
Yeah. Pellings. How much is it worth?
Two million? Three million? More?

1093
01:19:00,309 --> 01:19:04,069
How does a hotel manager
manage to raise that kind of money?

1094
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:06,909
I don't know, but how does killing
Monkberry and Kingslake help?

1095
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:09,829
They were part of the membership
committee along with Tully.

1096
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,429
Do you remember the meetings
that the three of them had?

1097
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:16,149
They didn't like the fact
that Crisp was considering
Claypole for membership. So?

1098
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:21,389
I think Martin Crisp had someone
much more controversial lined up.

1099
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:25,549
Someone the three of them
wouldn't vote for in a million years.

1100
01:19:27,869 --> 01:19:30,029
So he gets rid of two of them.

1101
01:19:30,029 --> 01:19:32,149
That leaves Miles Tully.

1102
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:34,349
And the committee meeting's today.

1103
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:36,589
We'd better find him.
Thank you, George.

1104
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:39,389
My pleasure.

1105
01:19:48,788 --> 01:19:52,708
Is er...everything in order...
Mrs Fountain?

1106
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,788
Oh, yes, Mr Crisp.
Everything is very much in order.

1107
01:19:55,788 --> 01:19:58,668
Just the man.
Martin, you wanted to see me.

1108
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:01,708
Yes, I thought we might play
a couple of holes together.

1109
01:20:02,348 --> 01:20:05,228
There's something
I'd like your advice on.

1110
01:20:05,228 --> 01:20:07,388
Well, of course. I'd be delighted.

1111
01:20:20,588 --> 01:20:22,428
Thank you, Mrs Tully.

1112
01:20:22,428 --> 01:20:24,308
We'd better get a move on.

1113
01:20:24,308 --> 01:20:26,468
He's gone to the club
to have a drink with Crisp.

1114
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:31,268
So Crisp borrows money wherever
he can. He scrimps, he saves.

1115
01:20:31,268 --> 01:20:34,108
Finally, he gets enough money
together to buy Pellings.

1116
01:20:34,108 --> 01:20:37,668
But then Tunstall
raises the price...again.

1117
01:20:37,668 --> 01:20:41,308
So there he is,
still wanting more cash.

1118
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:44,188
And who does he turn to?
Eileen Fountain.

1119
01:20:44,188 --> 01:20:45,868
Eileen Fountain.

1120
01:20:45,868 --> 01:20:48,028
But she wants something in return,
doesn't she?

1121
01:20:48,028 --> 01:20:50,508
Membership for her beloved Darren.

doubt very, very much, sweetheart,

What about it?
Well...

1150
01:23:21,503 --> 01:23:24,343
I wanted to talk about
the candidates for membership.

1151

to discuss that,

If this is about Harry Claypole,

will approve him.

01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:39,183
Why do you like Darren more than me?

1244
01:29:39,183 --> 01:29:41,343
Who said I did?

1245
01:29:41,343 --> 01:29:43,663
You do, though, don't you?

1246
01:29:45,143 --> 01:29:47,183
You never talk to anyone.

1247
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:50,743
Why should people like you
if you don't talk to them?

1248
01:29:50,743 --> 01:29:52,703
You're a bit scary, Colin.

1249
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:56,903
You're scaring me now. I'm going.

1250
01:29:56,903 --> 01:29:59,103
Wait.

1251
01:30:02,743 --> 01:30:04,303
Look...

1252
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:20,023
God.

1253
01:30:20,023 --> 01:30:21,863
It's for you.

1254
01:30:23,743 --> 01:30:25,423
Me?

1255
01:30:25,423 --> 01:30:27,863
So you'll like me.

1256
01:30:29,503 --> 01:30:33,223
No, Colin,
that's not the way it works.

1257
01:30:33,223 --> 01:30:35,503
Now let me go.

1258
01:30:35,503 --> 01:30:37,183
Wait!

1259
01:30:42,623 --> 01:30:44,263
All right, all right.

1260
01:30:44,263 --> 01:30:45,863
You're all right now

1261
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:47,503
(SHOUTING)

1262
01:30:49,183 --> 01:30:51,223
(PIG GRUNTS)

1263
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:06,063
So all the details were written
in Eileen Fountain's ledger.

1264
01:31:06,063 --> 01:31:08,623
Yes, her book-keeping
was impeccable.

1265
01:31:08,623 --> 01:31:10,903
And apart from Tully,
Kingslake and Monkberry,

1266
01:31:10,903 --> 01:31:13,983
everyone, every single man
on that membership committee,

1267
01:31:13,983 --> 01:31:15,823
was in hock to Eileen Fountain.

1268
01:31:15,823 --> 01:31:17,903
They would have voted for the pig
if asked.

1269
01:31:17,903 --> 01:31:20,543
What about the builder chap?
Claypole?

1270
01:31:20,543 --> 01:31:22,823
Martin Crisp introduced him
to test the water,

1271
01:31:22,823 --> 01:31:24,743
to see what the reaction would be.

1272
01:31:24,743 --> 01:31:27,223
Of course,
Kingslake and co were outraged.

1273
01:31:27,223 --> 01:31:30,303
So he knew that Darren Fountain
wouldn't stand a chance.

1274
01:31:30,303 --> 01:31:35,023
So Crisp had to eliminate
the opposition. Yeah.

1275
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:37,983
Crisp's office had French windows,
opened on to the golf course.

1276
01:31:37,983 --> 01:31:42,263
He kept a little buggy, a little
golf buggy, there all the time.

1277
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,503
People were used to him
buzzing around in it.

1278
01:31:44,503 --> 01:31:47,703
So he hid the buggy,
got into his track suit,

1279
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:49,663
and waited by the periscope.

1280
01:31:49,663 --> 01:31:52,383
Now, he was due to play a round
of golf with Ed Monkberry.

1281
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:55,183
But Monkberry cancelled,
so he had to improvise...

1282
01:31:55,183 --> 01:31:56,743
with the knife.

1283
01:31:57,863 --> 01:32:00,743
Do go and get changed, Tom.
They'll be here in a minute.

1284
01:32:00,743 --> 01:32:03,703
There's plenty of time. Oh, God.

1285
01:32:03,703 --> 01:32:05,743
What?
I forgot my bat.

1286
01:32:05,743 --> 01:32:08,183
You mean, your racquet.

1287
01:32:08,183 --> 01:32:10,783
Don't worry. Here it is.

1288
01:32:10,783 --> 01:32:14,183
Oh, thank you, Joyce.
What would I do without you?

1289
01:32:14,183 --> 01:32:16,143
Not a lot. Oh!

1290
01:32:16,143 --> 01:32:20,943
Here they are. You two are cruising
for a bruising today.

1291
01:32:20,943 --> 01:32:23,663
We're gonna run you ragged.
You'd better get changed, Tom.

1292
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:25,543
We're on in five minutes.
Absolutely.

1293
01:32:25,543 --> 01:32:27,423
Ooh.

1294
01:32:27,423 --> 01:32:29,743
Are you all right?
Yeah, fine. No.

1295
01:32:29,743 --> 01:32:34,223
Oh, I think
I've tweaked my hamstring.

1296
01:32:34,223 --> 01:32:37,143
Run it off, that's the thing.
Yes, get on court and run it off.

1297
01:32:38,703 --> 01:32:40,343
Right.

1298
01:32:43,623 --> 01:32:46,543
You three, you can start without me.
Please.
