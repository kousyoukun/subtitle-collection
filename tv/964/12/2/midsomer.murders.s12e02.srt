1
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:11,437
Schnell. Machst du schnell.

2
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:47,917
Danke.
Bitte Joseph.

3
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,237
Jetzt.

4
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,237
Ech Verstanden. Achtung.

5
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:21,237
Jawohl.

6
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,557
Allenby House?

7
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:27,437
Up there, mate.

8
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:41,077
Come on.

9
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,917
Oh, for God's sake!

10
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:56,037
That you, was it?

11
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,997
Well, I don't see anyone else
around here.

12
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,237
No. Nor do I.

13
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:05,317
Could you move your mutton
off the road, please?

14
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:07,277
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

15
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,157
Right away, Sir.
Thank you.

16
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,637
I'll just leave this here.
Hmm? Right.

17
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:13,397
OK?
Hmm?

18
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,757
Oi! Whoa!

19
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,197
Oh, my God, what are you doing?!

20
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:21,637
Oi!

21
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,757
Hey, don't just walk away!
Get this off of here.

22
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:28,117
Oh, my God. Look at my car! My car!

23
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:35,557
And it was you who discovered
the forced entry, was it, sir?
No, Joyce, no.

24
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:38,117
I'm not going to go out on Sunday.

25
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:40,157
Sunday is my day of rest.

26
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:42,117
Sir...

27
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,037
We'll talk later.

28
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,677
What is it now, Sir Malcolm?

29
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,837
Look at the time, you dim ninny.

30
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:59,077
It's five o'clock. Rush hour.

31
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:02,597
You bring us this way,
we'll be here till breakfast!

32
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:06,477
Take us past the community centre
and then on up to the crem.

33
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:08,237
Right, Sir.

34
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:11,877
What's all that about?

35
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:16,037
Sir Malcolm Frazer has but a passing
acquaintance with reality.

36
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:18,277
He's rehearsing his own funeral.

37
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,917
He thinks they're coming to get him.

38
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,957
Which they?
Oh, God knows.

39
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:27,957
I just wish they'd hurry up.

40
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,637
Sir...
What?

41
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:37,237
..I don't suppose you've heard
anything about my application for -
No, Stephens, I have not.

42
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,277
And even if I had,
I couldn't possibly say.

43
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:42,877
So...you could know something then?

44
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,117
Go away.

45
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:01,437
Agh!

46
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:03,557
You stupid... Agh!

47
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:06,117
What was that for?

48
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:09,197
This...is a grenade, old son.

49
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,837
If you don't whack it
out of the ground,

50
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,717
we all get blown to hell.

51
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:21,317
Gently does it. Watch the varnish.

52
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:25,477
You see? Couldn't be easier.

53
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:27,597
Roll out and roll on.

54
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,477
Hey-ho, away we go.

55
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:33,277
Come on.

56
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,397
That's the ticket. Now...

57
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,397
..during the final hymn...

58
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:45,197
# Bread of Heaven

59
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,557
# Feed me now and ever more

60
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,837
# Ever more #

61
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,997
Unity up here in the pulpit.

62
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:55,317
Don't want the vicar doing it.
Complete faffer.

63
00:06:55,317 --> 00:07:01,677
You press the button here, which
sends me down to my last little
journey to the barbecue.

64
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:03,637
And so from box to earth.

65
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:06,317
Any questions?
Can we go home now?

66
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:37,437
Gonna kill someone some day.

67
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:40,517
Not if I get him first.

68
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:47,037
Oi! You! Wells!

69
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,797
Hang on, lads.

70
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,717
Ooh, here we go.

71
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:58,917
What do YOU want? Just slumming.
How are the Peasants XI today?

72
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,397
Ready to take you
pack of tossers apart.

73
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,197
Thrashed you last year.

74
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:05,637
Yeah, ball tampering. Bent umpire.

75
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,797
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

76
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:11,437
Good, jolly good. Let's keep it
for the game shall we?

77
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:14,637
We'd like you to change your umpire
this year. Why?

78
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:17,277
Because Sir Malcolm is half blind.

79
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:19,157
I am not.

80
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:22,037
Who do you have in mind?

81
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:26,077
Anyone who isn't biased, bent,
or bribed.

82
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:30,477
You cannot be serious.

83
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:35,037
You could balance out some of Sir
Malcolm's more daft decisions. No.

84
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:40,357
It might not end in the usual
punch-up if you're there.
You're not listening to me.

85
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:45,717
Jones, Sunday is my day off.
I'll be in there watching the telly,
brain in neutral.

86
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:50,557
After you've fixed the down pipe
and talked to the neighbours
about their hedge,

87
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,437
and gone to the garden centre.

88
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:04,877
What-ho, young Jarvis.

89
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,797
Sir Malcolm, this is now
a safe house, right?

90
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,797
This is our home.

91
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:13,997
Which you rent to the government,
correct? Yes, your point being?

92
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:17,717
I've just walked in unchallenged.
We knew you were coming.

93
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:20,077
That...that is not the point.

94
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:24,837
Tomorrow a VIP is arriving.
Everything must be in order
vis-a-vis security.

95
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:26,557
Who is coming?
Classified.

96
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,917
We have the highest clearance.

97
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:33,917
Not for some time.
Listen, chummy, I was running Berlin
while you were in nappies.

98
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:38,317
Nicky and Jenny were operatives when
you were pushing your first pen.

99
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:42,077
And now you're running a specialised
B&B, so get used to it.

100
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:46,997
And make sure these CCTV cameras
are working.

101
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:50,637
Oh, we don't like him, do we?

102
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:54,237
No, we don't.
Don't you dare. You leave him alone.

103
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:57,117
We need the money.
Allenby needs the money.

104
00:09:58,477 --> 00:10:00,397
And I need a drink.

105
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:15,157
I was a spook once.

106
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,957
You were not.
I was.

107
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:20,037
When I graduated from Bramshill...

108
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,037
..they asked me to join MI6.

109
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:25,197
Why?

110
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:27,077
Cos I spoke Russian.

111
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,677
But you don't speak Russian.

112
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:33,717
No, they got the wrong person.
They wanted Brenda Packard.

113
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,797
Brenda? In our W I?
Grows big vegetables?

114
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:39,957
That's the chap.
She's been with MI6 for years.

115
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:43,237
Goodness.
I tried it for a few months.

116
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:46,517
Security officer, grade 7.

117
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:49,757
Drank gallons of weak tea
and, er, played cricket...

118
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:51,597
..in the corridors.

119
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:54,157
You never told me any of this.

120
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:56,357
Well, no, Joyce. Secret, innit?

121
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:30,997
There are 42 basic
areas in cricket rules.

122
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:34,917
And they are split
into numbered sub-headings,

123
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:38,877
which produce thousands and thousands
of sub sub-clauses.

124
00:11:38,877 --> 00:11:41,117
I will never forgive you for this.

125
00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:43,957
What's happening?

126
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,397
Bossy woman came in looking for you.

127
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:50,397
Wouldn't give her name,
but left you this.

128
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:52,557
A lot of numbers.
Thank you.

129
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:57,317
Also, break-in at the museum.
Nothing missing, though.
Think you can handle that?

130
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,237
I'll do my best.

131
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,237
So what is it?

132
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:06,997
It's a substitution and multiplication cipher
based on a pre-agreed word,

133
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:10,397
then given its numerical
position in the alphabet,

134
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:15,917
multiplied by the date of delivery
and sent in five-number sections.
So what does it say?

135
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,117
I haven't the faintest idea.

136
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,277
Morning.
Morning. Ah!

137
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:22,957
Woman Police Constable Stephens.

138
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,557
I have a letter here for you.

139
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:33,397
Oh, maybe it's not for you,
because it's addressed to...

140
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:35,797
..Detective Constable Stephens.

141
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:02,597
Do you think you could phone
next time, please, Brenda?

142
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:04,837
I like to keep my hand in.

143
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:07,237
It took me two hours
to work this out.

144
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:09,797
Oh, a beer. Thank you very much.

145
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:12,517
The beer's for me. Lemonade for you.

146
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,717
So how's the daughter, then?

147
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,797
Forever in your debt.

148
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,677
As am I.

149
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:23,357
You're not really retired, are you?

150
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:27,437
Let's just say I tend to work more
form the garden these days.

151
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:29,397
So what can I do for you?

152
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:32,877
Allenby House.

153
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,157
The company, in its wisdom,

154
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:37,797
has decreed that it should be
a safe house.

155
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,557
Safe house? Run by Malcolm Frazer?

156
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:43,077
What sort of drugs
are they on?

157
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:45,197
Relatively safe house, then.

158
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:48,997
A stopover for people on sensitive
government business.

159
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,877
Good food, comfy beds,

160
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,917
and the odd, er...

161
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:58,277
..whatever they need
to keep them happy and cooperative.

162
00:13:58,277 --> 00:14:01,237
I do not approve.
Your approval is not required.

163
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,157
But your expertise could be.

164
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:09,037
I was hoping you might pay
an informal courtesy call

165
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:12,797
and check that everything
is tickety-boo at the funny farm.

166
00:14:12,797 --> 00:14:14,877
Why can't you do that?

167
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:21,237
Because I am the left hand that
doesn't let the right hand know
what it's doing. Oh, the great game.

168
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:24,077
Mr Kipling wasn't just a jam tart.

169
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,317
Your health.

170
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,437
Sir.

171
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:51,917
Morning.

172
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,797
Mr Barnaby.
Yes.

173
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,957
I gather you were once one of us.

174
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:02,117
Just passing through.

175
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:05,277
Pity. We might have ended up
on the same desk.

176
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:10,237
He's in the library.

177
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:12,117
Thank you.

178
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:23,397
Silk is best. Nylon would really
irritate the skin.

179
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,277
I'm sure you're right, Sir.

180
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:28,957
What brings the plod round here?

181
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:34,677
I gather that your house, has been 
inducted into the service of Queen and country.

182
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:38,637
I had no choice. Allenby soaks up
the dosh like a sponge.

183
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:43,197
And I wondered if you needed any help
with security, anything like that.

184
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,837
Oh. Well, that's very good of you.

185
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,397
Yes, yes, what do you want?

186
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:52,397
I was just wondering
who your visitor was.

187
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:57,397
This is DCI Barnaby. He's offered
to double check the security
stuff for us.

188
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:01,237
How kind. But I think you'll find
our arrangements are...

189
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:04,797
..probably beyond the
expertise of a country policeman.

190
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,277
Barnaby worked for the company
when you were about 12.

191
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:10,437
Well, isn't that interesting.

192
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,717
But we can manage fine. Thank you.

193
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,957
Is it illegal to strangle
nasty little weasels?

194
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:22,517
I think it's actively encouraged,
isn't it, Sir?

195
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,997
They don't seem to have stolen
anything.

196
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:30,357
Are you sure? Well, I haven't done
a total check,

197
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:34,837
but they certainly didn't take
anything valuable.
Nothing vandalised?

198
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:37,757
Bit of a mystery, Mr Jones.

199
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:41,277
Certainly is, Miss Watson.

200
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:45,237
Are you ever coming round again?

201
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,637
I can't sleep with a suspect.

202
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,717
Suspect? Well, you could have done
it yourself.

203
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:53,157
An insurance scam.
You big chicken.

204
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:54,957
How about tonight?
No.

205
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:59,157
Look...

206
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:02,277
..just...check your stock
and give me a call.

207
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:04,237
At the station.

208
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,797
It wouldn't take long.
I'd be gentle.

209
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,677
Oh, you are...

210
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:11,037
I'd still respect you. (GIGGLES)

211
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:23,237
So...who's the grand fromage?

212
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:29,397
Dear God.
Geoffrey Larkin.

213
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:34,557
I recruited him 30 years ago
straight out of Causton Grammar.

214
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:37,197
Best young batsman
this county ever had.

215
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,677
Sir Malcolm.

216
00:17:39,677 --> 00:17:41,677
Long time no see.

217
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:44,357
Damned traitor.

218
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:51,637
SIR MALCOLM: Hurry up, Seth.
Get a move-on.

219
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:55,237
Sir Malcolm. I'd like to thank you.

220
00:17:55,757 --> 00:18:00,077
What for? For getting me on board
the biggest gravy train ever.

221
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:02,157
I don't find that funny.

222
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,957
If I'd had my way -
Malcolm...

223
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,077
..Geoffrey's our guest.

224
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,237
Government's guest.

225
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:11,597
When I was a lad, this house was
just a sort of...

226
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:14,157
..unattainable concept
on the horizon.

227
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:17,117
Now I could buy ten of them.

228
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:19,997
Amazing how the world turns,
eh, Malcolm?

229
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,637
Are you still playing cricket?

230
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:26,877
Whenever I can.
How about tomorrow?

231
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:30,037
We have the annual match
against the village team.

232
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:33,237
As a house guest,
you'd be eligible to play.

233
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,637
Mr Larkin is here
for important discussions
with government ministers.

234
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:40,597
He's not here to waste time
playing cricket.

235
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,677
I'll think about it.
I really do feel -

236
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,597
I said I'll think about it.

237
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:51,517
Well, whatever we can do to
make your stay more pleasurable...

238
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:53,597
You must be a boy scout.

239
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,109
Morning.

240
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:45,509
Morning all. And a lovely morning
it is, too.

241
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,909
Looks like a serious breakfast!

242
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,789
Nicky?
Father?

243
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:03,609
Father...

244
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,609
..it's been too long.

245
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,649
He asked what I'm up to.

246
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:10,769
So... (IMITATES MORSE CODE)

247
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,249
Don't be so damn rude.

248
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:25,249
Could we have a little less morse
code. I've got a terrible headache.


249
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,049
Morning, Glen.
Morning.

250
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:34,009
I was just saying I'd be delighted
to play for their team
against the village yobs. Fantastic.

251
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:37,289
Being a former yob myself,
I know how they think.

252
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,249
Don't I, Malcolm?

253
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:44,569
See? The throat.

254
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,689
Look at the throat.

255
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:49,129
Torn, slashed, ripped right out.

256
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,569
Yes, I can see that, Mr Comfort.

257
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,329
So what done it, eh?

258
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:56,489
Probably...a dog.

259
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,289
A dog?

260
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,369
What kind of dog done that?

261
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:02,369
That ain't no dog, woman.

262
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,289
No dog's that vicious.

263
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,089
So what do YOU think it was?

264
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:09,729
Obvious, ain't it?

265
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:11,609
The beast.

266
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,529
The beast?
The beast.

267
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:17,209
The beast has returned.

268
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:20,009
Just like they said it would.

269
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,929
You'd best be catching it
before it does more than sheep.

270
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:25,849
Sergeant.

271
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,569
Thank you so much
for your assistance.

272
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:30,529
This way, please, sir.

273
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,529
Just through there.

274
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,769
The big foot and mouth.
He lost his cottage.

275
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:40,689
Life's been a bit...too much for him
since.

276
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,729
Ben...

277
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,849
..what do you think?

278
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:51,329
I mean, how plain are plain clothes
supposed to be?

279
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:57,489
Erm...'The umpire shall make frequent and
irregular inspections of the ball.

280
00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:02,529
In the event of any fielder changing
the condition of the ball unfairly,

281
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,209
the umpire shall change the ball
forthwith.

282
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:09,049
Rule 69, sub-section 7...'

283
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:16,649
Going somewhere?
I believe in meticulous planning.

284
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,209
And turning every situation
to your own advantage.

285
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,449
You were the one that did that.

286
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:24,449
You betrayed our whole ethos.

287
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:26,369
(SCOFFS) Oh, dear, oh, dear.

288
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,249
Naughty Geoffrey Larkin.

289
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:30,169
Didn't go to our school.

290
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,289
Wasn't a member of our club.

291
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:34,729
And worse of all, got very rich.

292
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:36,889
What do you want?

293
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:39,449
November the 9th, 1989.
Ring any bells?

294
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,889
Berlin wall came down.

295
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,289
Right. End of history.

296
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:51,409
And guess who was one of the first
people clambering over the rubble

297
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:54,369
to have a squizz at the East German
files, eh?

298
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,329
Yup. Geoffrey Larkin.

299
00:24:57,449 --> 00:25:01,249
Walked away with suitcases
full of fascinating documents.

300
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,369
Typical.

301
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,649
I recently came across one old file
marked...

302
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:08,489
..Wolfman.

303
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:13,289
Hello.

304
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,449
You've gone all pale.

305
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:18,329
Blood pressure having
a bit of a plummet?

306
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,689
Wolfman, whoever he was,

307
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:25,929
liked to feed at 70 Wilhelmstrasse.

308
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:29,569
The British Embassy.

309
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,129
Would you like that file,
Sir Malcolm?

310
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:37,169
I don't do deals with traitors.

311
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:55,249
BARNABY: You want what?
Since our guest at Allenby -

312
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:58,729
Geoffrey Larkin.
Whose identity is classified
information.

313
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,969
Not in the pub, it isn't.

314
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:06,849
Since our guest at Allenby has seen
fit to play cricket at this village
match this afternoon -

315
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:09,209
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

316
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:12,689
No, no, he can't do that.
He played for the county.

317
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:17,849
But as a guest at Allenby, he has the
correct residential qualifications.

318
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,569
I've already cleared it.
Well, thanks a lot (!)

319
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:22,609
Jones...

320
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:26,169
Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Jarvis,
you were saying.

321
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,449
I would like you to provide extra
men at said cricket match

322
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:32,329
to ensure his safety.

323
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:35,329
Policemen?

324
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:38,569
Obviously. This is a matter
of national security.

325
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:41,209
Well, I'm very sorry, Mr Jarvis,

326
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:47,809
but all my men are fully occupied
serving the local community.
Why don't you ask Scotland Yard?

327
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:50,049
Are you refusing my request?

328
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,209
(AS YOKEL) Well, happen as maybe
I am, Sir, yes.

329
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,609
Ah, right.

330
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,689
Bye, Inspector.

331
00:26:57,689 --> 00:27:00,329
Be it...on...your head.

332
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:03,409
You precious little...

333
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:08,249
I can't believe you OK'd Larkin to
play for Allenby. That's so unfair.

334
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:11,369
Look, maybe if you'd chosen
another umpire,

335
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,049
he might have made
a different decision.

336
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,969
What do you think of this one?

337
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,089
Not yet!

338
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:35,089
TANNOY: Boys and girls, welcome
to the annual match between Midsomer
Parva and an Allenby House XI.

339
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:40,489
Weather set to be fair, we hope,
and the umpires and captains
have taken to the field

340
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:44,289
to see who wins the toss.
Let's wish both sides good luck

341
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,209
and may the best team win.

342
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:48,489
Oh, erm...tails.

343
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:50,369
Hmm.
It's, erm, heads, Father.

344
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,449
What?

345
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:54,569
Oh, yes, yes, so it is.

346
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:56,689
Right, well done, Nicky.

347
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,569
So, Allenby to bat.

348
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,329
We're gonna murder you.
Jolly good, bring it on.

349
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:04,329
Toff git.
Peasant trash.

350
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,529
Oi, oi. No sledging.

351
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:09,609
One sign of trouble
and I'll cancel this match.

352
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:11,649
You can't do that.
Oh, yes I can.

353
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:15,529
So...shut up, pad up,
and play the game.

354
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,849
Right. Good.

355
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:19,849
Get in, lads!

356
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:23,049
Five minutes!
You know Sir Malcolm is half-blind?

357
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,169
I had noticed. So you'll overrule
any of his really daft decisions?

358
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:29,049
Just bowl, Jones.

359
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,969
Come on, lads, be sharp!

360
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,889
Play.

361
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:39,609
Howzat!

362
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,729
Not out.

363
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,769
It was lbw!

364
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:46,729
Not out?!

365
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:48,609
Unbelievable.

366
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:51,129
Good call.

367
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,089
Not out.

368
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:06,129
Not out?!

369
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:09,169
For God's sake,
his stump's in flaming Guildford!

370
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:11,049
What?

371
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:15,929
Oh. I...I'm sorry, Nicky,
I can't really dispute that one.

372
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,529
That's all right, Father.

373
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,489
Howzat!

374
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,529
No ball.
What?!

375
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:36,089
Your foot was over the line. Yards.

376
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:38,769
Get on with it.

377
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,809
Catch it!

378
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:50,809
Catch it!

379
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,889
Oh, thank you (!)

380
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:01,169
ANNOUNCER: Batting at number five
is Geoffrey Larkin,

381
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,889
a former star of the Midsomer
Under-19s. Welcome home, Geoffrey.

382
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:10,609
I'm gonna chop you into little
pieces. Pulverise your sorry arse.

383
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,569
I'll look forward to that.

384
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,369
SIR MALCOLM: No ball.

385
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:36,089
Oh, come on, Dave!

386
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:56,249
I don't believe it.

387
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:03,689
ANNOUNCER: Well, played, Allenby.

388
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:06,689
They scored 170 for five
in their innings.

389
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,889
So, Midsomer Parva,
that's your target. 171.

390
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:13,489
Whose side are you on, Sir?

391
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:18,569
Same as always, Jones.
The side of decency, justice
and the American way.

392
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:24,089
I'd like to protest about the
inclusion of a former county player
in the Allenby team.

393
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:28,689
Yes, he did murder you, didn't he?
Well, it's typical Malcolm Frazer.

394
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:31,929
He was always a devious so-and-so.
Objection overruled.

395
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:35,689
A-ha.

396
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:39,569
I am enjoying this job.
Playing God in a limited universe.

397
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:47,009
Fantastic innings.

398
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,769
Thank you.

399
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:52,409
You're very good at scoring,
aren't you?

400
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,729
What do you think, Tom?

401
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:15,449
You can't give lbw from square leg.

402
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:20,289
Yes!

403
00:32:57,729 --> 00:32:59,649
Dead man.

404
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:02,089
Dead man.

405
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,809
Show me the ball, please.

406
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,209
Thank you.

407
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,049
This ball has been scratched.

408
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:16,809
No, no, no, just normal...
wear and tear.

409
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,409
What the hell are you doing?

410
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:29,089
This button has been filed down
to form a cutting edge.

411
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,049
I'm not a detective for nothing.

412
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,009
Come on!

413
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:36,889
New ball, please!

414
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,489
Yes!

415
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:56,089
ANNOUNCER: Bit of a collapse
for the village team, I'm afraid.

416
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:59,049
Last man in at number eleven.
Seth Comfort.

417
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:02,089
Couldn't be much closer.

418
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,809
Just one ball remaining
and the light's fading fast.

419
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:08,089
Allenby need that last wicket,

420
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,969
and the village needs to runs to win.

421
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,889
VOICE FROM CROWD: Come on, Seth.

422
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:35,889
ANNOUNCER: Oh, dear, that's it.
It's all over.

423
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,809
Allenby are the winners.
Congratulations.

424
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,889
His foot was over!

425
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:44,249
ANNOUNCER: Hold on,
there's a protest of some sort.

426
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,969
He touched the rope. It's a six.
No, he caught it. We won.

427
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,689
Mr Barnaby?
Oh, I'm sorry, I was...unsighted.

428
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,089
Aagh!
It's all over. We've won.

429
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,289
The hell you have. We won.

430
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,329
Oi!

431
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:04,289
ANNOUNCER: If people could just stay
off the pitch, please.

432
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:06,209
Clear the pitch...

433
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:09,809
I... Oh, this is really dreadful.

434
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,689
Sir?
I am off duty.

435
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:15,729
But I've rostered you on.
I'm sure you can handle it. Bye-bye.

436
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:23,609
MAN IN PUB:
Scored again, have you, Andy?

437
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:26,169
WOMAN IN PUB: What a cheek!
MAN: Ignore him.

438
00:36:15,748 --> 00:36:20,028
Whatever else, this murder had
nothing to do with the cricket.

439
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:23,668
How would you let this happen?
I warned you, I told you -

440
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:28,268
Calm down. Just walk away. Walk away.
Calm...? It's a disaster.

441
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:31,748
Mr Comfort, we're recording.
Go ahead. Hello? Hello...

442
00:36:31,748 --> 00:36:33,748
I told 'em, I warned 'em.

443
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:36,948
It's the beast. The Beast of
Midsomer.

444
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:41,188
I told 'em it were the beast.
Yes, I did.

445
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:43,948
You're soft in the head, Seth.
Shut up.

446
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:46,308
You'll see, you'll see.
Jarvis.

447
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:49,988
Is...is...is it important?!
It's important, yes!

448
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:55,388
What makes you think a wild beast
is responsible, Mr Comfort?
The Midsomer Chronicles,

449
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:59,548
Deacon Henry of Causton writ
that when the badness shall come,

450
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:02,308
so shall the beast of vengeance...

451
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,708
..and that.
Thank you, Mr Comfort.

452
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,588
Yeah.
OK, wrap it up, Bob.

453
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:15,188
Multiple lacerations, varying
in depth and intensity.

454
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:17,548
Agricultural tool?
Unlikely.

455
00:37:18,748 --> 00:37:21,388
More like some sort of claw.
Claw?

456
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:23,388
Eagle? Lion?
Bigger.

457
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:27,428
Bigger than a lion?

458
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:29,748
These are very deep gashes, Tom.

459
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,748
Not dissimilar to those evidenced
on certain sheep recently.

460
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:36,628
Oh, so it's the Hound
of the Baskervilles?

461
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:38,668
Have to keep an open mind.

462
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:41,388
I think you should keep on digging.

463
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:45,228
Not my fault that the world
isn't all black and white.

464
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,148
Jones!

465
00:37:56,868 --> 00:38:01,308
Right, I want them all in the
library, including the staff.

466
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:06,148
There's a straightforward procedure
in a police investigation like this.

467
00:38:06,148 --> 00:38:09,228
We ask you questions,
you try and answer them,

468
00:38:09,228 --> 00:38:13,628
and please add any information
you think may help our enquiries.

469
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:18,868
Detective Sergeant Jones here
and myself - Excuse me, Inspector.
Could I have a word?

470
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:21,468
Please.
In private. It's very important.

471
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,588
Excuse me.

472
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:31,788
Yes? These people cannot answer
your questions.

473
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:37,668
I beg your pardon? They've all
signed the Official Secrets Act.

474
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:43,148
As it pertains to national security,
it will be investigated by security services.

475
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:49,228
Oh, no, Sir, this is a murder
investigation in an area for which
I'm the senior police officer.

476
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:52,988
Those people will cooperate with me
or I will lock them up.

477
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:57,068
It's a shame you didn't heed my
earlier request for assistance.

478
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,268
Yes, I have him here.

479
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,948
Hello? Who is this, please?

480
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:10,148
Really. And what do you want?

481
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:19,228
Sir, I...

482
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:22,828
Where...?

483
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:38,148
Do we have a problem?
You have no jurisdiction.

484
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:41,508
The hell I don't.
You also...signed the Act.

485
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,308
I...

486
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:47,668
This was a million years ago.

487
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:50,988
It still stands. Oh, no, Brenda,
I'm not having this.

488
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,708
All this MI6 Mickey Mouse gump.
I don't give a damn.

489
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:58,588
This is my investigation
and you are not going to stop it.

490
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:00,508
Stubborn as ever.

491
00:40:07,628 --> 00:40:09,748
We always win, Tom.

492
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:12,308
You lot think you have the power,

493
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:15,348
but we're the real bullies
in the playground.

494
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:18,388
Sorry.

495
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:25,668
Set up a road block
outside Allenby House.

496
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:27,948
List me the lot of them.

497
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:31,388
I want details of everyone
who goes in and out.

498
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:35,988
Don't you think that's being
a bit petty, Sir?
A bit counter-productive?

499
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:38,868
Would you kindly do as you're told,
please?

500
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:46,428
I do think we need to try
and work together, as a team.

501
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:52,148
This can't stand.

502
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:54,908
We cannot have a state
within a state.

503
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:57,428
Absolutely.
And if it hadn't been for me,

504
00:40:57,428 --> 00:41:01,988
that Brenda Packard woman
wouldn't still be in her job.

505
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:06,508
I thought she was retired.
Oh, they never retire, Joyce.

506
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:10,068
They're vultures. They just change
trees now and again.

507
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,468
You've been suspended before.
Yes.

508
00:41:12,468 --> 00:41:14,508
Well?
What?

509
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:18,468
You just got on with it
until they came to their senses.

510
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:21,188
I can't even speak
to the sodding suspects.

511
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,348
I am banned from the crime scene.

512
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:25,788
So, think laterally.

513
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:28,628
What does that mean?

514
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:32,868
I don't know. You're the one
that's always telling me to do it.

515
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,348
What do you mean?

516
00:41:48,348 --> 00:41:51,468
It's a fairly straightforward
question, Jimmy.

517
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:54,828
What was your relationship
with Sir Malcolm Frazer?

518
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:57,988
You get out the wrong side
of bed this morning?

519
00:41:57,988 --> 00:42:02,428
You called Sir Malcolm Frazer a
devious so-and-so. What did you mean?

520
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:04,868
Do you have some history
with the man?

521
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:08,508
I signed the Act as well, you know.
Oh, for crying out loud.

522
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:12,268
Is there anybody in this village
who didn't sign? Sorry, mate.

523
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,828
OK, OK.

524
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:19,148
I'll see your Official Secrets

525
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:24,348
and raise you one quite extensive
criminal record.

526
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:28,508
How many convictions DO you have
for breaking and entering, Jimmy?

527
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:31,028
Oh, I was a kid, for Christ's sakes.

528
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:34,708
It won't look good at the golf club.
You're blackmailing me?

529
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:38,948
I am talking to the citizen
in the way that citizen understands.

530
00:42:38,948 --> 00:42:42,428
(SIGHS) I was Frazer's chauffeur
for a few years,

531
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:44,588
mainly while he was in Berlin.

532
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:46,308
And why was he devious?

533
00:42:46,908 --> 00:42:50,828
Well, because they are, aren't they,
people like him.

534
00:42:50,828 --> 00:42:55,508
1985, Jimmy. How did you come by the
money to start your car business?

535
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:58,428
Won it on the horses.

536
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:02,988
If you're going to lie to me, try
and be convincing. Show some respect.

537
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:09,028
It were predicted, Mr Barnaby.

538
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:11,188
Really? By whom?

539
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:16,588
My Granda'. He said beast'll
come back when things go wrong.

540
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:20,668
And where did your grandad
get that information from, Seth?

541
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:23,188
The Chronicles.
I'm sorry, the what?

542
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:26,868
The Midsomer Chronicles of...
16 summat.

543
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,748
When badness come,

544
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:31,748
so will the beast.

545
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:34,788
It's writ.
Is it?

546
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:36,828
Oh, yeah.

547
00:43:36,828 --> 00:43:40,428
Well, we'd better find your beast,
hadn't we, Sir?

548
00:43:40,428 --> 00:43:44,668
Now...you work up at Allenby House,
don't you?

549
00:43:44,668 --> 00:43:48,988
Helps out a bit. Yes, and your sheep
graze on Allenby land, don't they?

550
00:43:48,988 --> 00:43:53,868
So maybe...one of their CCTV cameras
caught your beast in passing.

551
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,908
Dunno. Well, you could find out,
couldn't you?

552
00:43:57,908 --> 00:44:04,228
You could pop into the security
control room and check the
recordings for the last few nights.

553
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:08,868
Or better still,
bring those recordings to me
and I'll check them for you.

554
00:44:12,188 --> 00:44:14,068
Barnaby.

555
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:16,588
What are you doing, Barnaby?

556
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:20,308
Sir?
The road block outside Allenby.

557
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:23,748
Well, I believe I have
the authority.

558
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:26,668
Well, I'm overruling that authority.

559
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:29,308
Get your tanks
off the company's lawn.

560
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,108
Clear?

561
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:34,228
Sir...

562
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:36,388
..may I see you this afternoon?

563
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:03,828
What do you think you're doing?

564
00:45:03,828 --> 00:45:05,948
My chores, Sir.

565
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:09,028
Get out and stay out. Permanently.
You're fired.

566
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:11,868
Ooh, I don't think so, Sir.
Really? Why not?

567
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:14,308
Cos I know all the answers, Sir.

568
00:45:14,308 --> 00:45:16,668
I even know some of the questions.

569
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:19,348
Sir.

570
00:45:36,628 --> 00:45:38,428
Come in.

571
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:44,628
Thank you for...seeing me
so promptly.

572
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:58,576
Oh, nobody told me
lunch was being served.

573
00:45:59,496 --> 00:46:02,336
Because staff usually eat
in the kitchen.

574
00:46:02,816 --> 00:46:06,536
Oh, I see, that's your idea
of cooperation, is it?

575
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:08,776
Your mess. You clear it up.

576
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:12,296
It's not our fault your prize
chicken got strangled.

577
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,336
I'm gonna get this place
closed down.

578
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:18,816
And you lot with it.

579
00:46:21,016 --> 00:46:25,296
Hmm. I suppose we will have to sort
the little runt out after all.

580
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:26,936
I'll drink to that.

581
00:46:27,936 --> 00:46:29,816
You'd drink to anything.

582
00:46:36,016 --> 00:46:38,696
Where's she going?
Your wife, dear boy.

583
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:42,216
Should have asked her that
years ago.

584
00:46:43,256 --> 00:46:46,696
Seth told me this was the only one
he could get.

585
00:46:46,696 --> 00:46:48,616
Check this bit.

586
00:46:51,136 --> 00:46:53,056
Sir?
I'm sorry. What?

587
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:04,776
That's Jenny Frazer
the night before the murder.

588
00:47:04,776 --> 00:47:07,136
Can't see who she's with, though.

589
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:12,216
No sound.

590
00:47:15,536 --> 00:47:17,736
It's part of the investigation.

591
00:47:20,696 --> 00:47:23,216
I think it might be Geoffrey Larkin.

592
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:28,336
Otherwise why bother to sneak out to
the barn in the middle of the night?

593
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:37,616
How long had she known him?

594
00:47:37,616 --> 00:47:39,696
A few hours.

595
00:47:39,696 --> 00:47:42,536
I think it was someone she knew
quite well.

596
00:47:42,536 --> 00:47:44,776
Why?

597
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:48,096
Because...most women
do not do THAT ...

598
00:47:48,816 --> 00:47:50,736
..on a first date.

599
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,976
Come here!
Excuse me, Harry.

600
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:22,816
What do you think you're doing?

601
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:27,056
Relaying your father's latest
funeral plans to the hearse driver.

602
00:48:27,056 --> 00:48:29,136
And have you given him one?

603
00:48:29,136 --> 00:48:34,016
He's male and can stand upright.
That's enough for you, isn't it?
You're drunk.

604
00:48:34,016 --> 00:48:35,936
And you're the village bike.

605
00:48:41,256 --> 00:48:43,216
Why?

606
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:45,176
Why everyone else but me?

607
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,856
Why do you think,
you pathetic little man?

608
00:48:50,736 --> 00:48:52,896
Oh, nice (!)

609
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,816
Very nice!
Go home.

610
00:48:54,816 --> 00:48:56,696
Go to bed. Sleep it off.

611
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:00,376
Go on.

612
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:24,936
Is everything all right?

613
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:28,056
Couldn't be better.

614
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:50,976
So, how many idiots does it take
to change a light bulb?

615
00:49:55,136 --> 00:49:58,216
Hello, little oik.
How's your career going?

616
00:49:58,216 --> 00:50:01,216
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got one any more.

617
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:30,016
What?

618
00:50:35,456 --> 00:50:37,496
OK.

619
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,376
Whatever you say.

620
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,896
I'll be there.

621
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,816
I just need a little sleepy first.

622
00:50:51,296 --> 00:50:55,536
TV ANNOUNCER: Our reporter spoke
to a local expert at the scene.

623
00:50:55,536 --> 00:50:59,016
It were writ, weren't it,
in the Midsomer Chronicles.

624
00:50:59,016 --> 00:51:01,216
Deacon Henry of Causton writ

625
00:51:01,216 --> 00:51:04,096
that when the badness shall come...

626
00:51:04,096 --> 00:51:08,696
So do you think Seth's nonsense has
anything to do with your case?

627
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:11,816
Hello?

628
00:51:11,816 --> 00:51:13,936
Anyone in?
Oh, I'm sorry.

629
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:17,136
Erm...my case.
It's not my case any more.

630
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:20,856
I resigned this afternoon.

631
00:51:23,136 --> 00:51:25,376
For God's sake....why?

632
00:51:26,056 --> 00:51:27,936
Well...

633
00:51:27,936 --> 00:51:29,976
..seemed time.

634
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:35,096
Now we can do all those things
we said we'd do when I retired.

635
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:38,216
Like what?

636
00:51:38,216 --> 00:51:40,216
Erm...oh, you know...

637
00:51:40,216 --> 00:51:42,296
..er...

638
00:51:42,296 --> 00:51:44,176
..retirement things.

639
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:47,776
Cruises.

640
00:51:47,776 --> 00:51:49,696
Whatever.

641
00:51:50,696 --> 00:51:52,496
Oh, God!

642
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:01,216
I don't suppose he'll want that.

643
00:52:01,216 --> 00:52:03,016
He always wakes up hungry.

644
00:52:03,016 --> 00:52:04,936
Ah, well.

645
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:06,856
You be nice to him, eh?

646
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:15,776
He's not in his room.

647
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:20,096
Nicky?

648
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:22,056
Nothing?
Not a sign, Ma'am.

649
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,776
Nicky?

650
00:52:26,336 --> 00:52:28,296
Nicky?

651
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:31,136
You've not found him?
No.

652
00:52:31,136 --> 00:52:33,056
Peter...

653
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:37,176
Nicky?

654
00:52:37,776 --> 00:52:40,136
Nicks?
Mr Frazer?

655
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:54,136
Oh...

656
00:53:01,616 --> 00:53:03,496
Oh, no!

657
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:06,816
Oh, Nicky.

658
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:19,216
Well, you'd better get it.

659
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:21,576
It's not my concern any more.

660
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:23,496
Oh, for God's sake.

661
00:53:24,016 --> 00:53:26,296
Don't... All right, all right.

662
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,056
Yes, yes, yes.

663
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,896
We need your help.
Police station.

664
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:41,696
Working hours.
Detective Sergeant Jones.

665
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:43,896
You need to come now.

666
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:46,416
No I do not.
There's been another death.

667
00:53:50,136 --> 00:53:52,176
Right. I'll, er...

668
00:53:52,176 --> 00:53:54,176
..I'll just do the...

669
00:53:54,176 --> 00:53:56,536
..the prelims, yeah...and, er...

670
00:53:56,536 --> 00:54:01,656
..I'll hand over the...the case
proper to...to Jones in the morning.

671
00:54:02,216 --> 00:54:04,056
Of course.

672
00:54:07,216 --> 00:54:09,096
Barnaby.

673
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:11,656
Oh, hello, Sir.

674
00:54:12,656 --> 00:54:14,576
Yes, yes, I had heard.

675
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,536
Oh, I see.

676
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:20,776
And that would be, would it,
with full control

677
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:24,016
and no further interference
from any other agencies?

678
00:54:24,016 --> 00:54:26,536
No, no, Sir, that's....that's fine.

679
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:29,736
Thank you, Sir...and goodbye.

680
00:54:31,656 --> 00:54:33,576
See you later.

681
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,096
Thank God for small murders.

682
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:45,016
Where have you been?

683
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:47,496
It's 6am, Sir. I was sleeping.

684
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:52,176
God, what happened?

685
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:56,616
Exactly the same as before. Multiple
lacerations by something unknown.

686
00:54:56,616 --> 00:54:58,696
Unknown to you.

687
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:01,336
Yes, Tom, and I'm no slouch,
thank you.

688
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:07,656
So maybe we should look at the feasibility -
No, no, George. Waste of time.

689
00:55:07,656 --> 00:55:10,456
We do not believe
in mythical beasts, do we?

690
00:55:10,456 --> 00:55:15,336
This is a simple murder togged up
to look like something tabloid.

691
00:55:15,336 --> 00:55:20,016
There is a rational explanation
for this and I need to know it.

692
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,936
Come on, Jones, chop, chop.

693
00:55:30,256 --> 00:55:32,456
Right.

694
00:55:32,456 --> 00:55:35,256
As I was saying,
before I was interrupted.

695
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:39,936
There's a straightforward procedure
for a formal...

696
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,136
He was...pretty useless...

697
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:48,256
..but he was my dear, dear boy.

698
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:53,216
His mother died, you see.

699
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:56,296
Now Nicky's gone.

700
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,976
Who'll take over Allenby now?

701
00:56:00,936 --> 00:56:03,016
Family, land, continuity.

702
00:56:03,016 --> 00:56:05,496
They give one a place, you know.

703
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:07,816
Without them, we're all a bit lost.

704
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:09,856
I am sorry, Sir, very sorry.

705
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:12,656
Do please ask your questions.

706
00:56:15,616 --> 00:56:17,856
Sir Malcolm...

707
00:56:17,856 --> 00:56:20,896
..what did you have against
Geoffrey Larkin?

708
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:22,856
He was a traitor.

709
00:56:23,536 --> 00:56:25,456
Was he?
Oh, yes.

710
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:27,656
Spent 15 years with us.

711
00:56:27,656 --> 00:56:31,976
All the while, quietly schmoozing
our network of contacts,

712
00:56:31,976 --> 00:56:35,896
so that when he left the service,
he could pal up with them

713
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:39,096
as a ludicrously overpaid
'defence consultant.' Yes.

714
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:41,656
Or, as we used to say, arms dealer.

715
00:56:42,496 --> 00:56:44,776
No gentleman.
No, right.

716
00:56:45,496 --> 00:56:47,456
And no private income.

717
00:56:48,616 --> 00:56:50,496
I'm sorry?

718
00:56:50,496 --> 00:56:52,936
Oh, just raking the gravel, Sir.

719
00:56:52,936 --> 00:56:54,816
Setting the lines straight.

720
00:56:57,896 --> 00:56:59,936
Tell me about Berlin.
Oh.

721
00:57:01,176 --> 00:57:04,736
You've been talking
to that Jimmy Wells, haven't you?

722
00:57:04,736 --> 00:57:07,096
Yes, well, it wasn't our fault.

723
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:09,576
What wasn't your fault?

724
00:57:10,536 --> 00:57:13,496
And it has nothing to do
with this inquiry.

725
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,376
Can I decide that?
No.

726
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:17,296
No?

727
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:19,416
No, nothing relevant there.

728
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,296
Take my word for it.

729
00:57:21,776 --> 00:57:24,656
There's nothing relevant
any more.

730
00:57:25,656 --> 00:57:27,576
So, er...if you don't mind.

731
00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:30,056
Certainly, Sir.

732
00:57:44,816 --> 00:57:47,016
It's not there. I've checked.

733
00:57:47,016 --> 00:57:49,096
It?

734
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:52,496
The...hound, or whatever it was
that killed Nicks.

735
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:56,256
We don't believe it was an animal,
Mrs Frazer.

736
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:59,376
Nor do I. Silly notion.

737
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:07,736
Er...it appears three DVDs are
missing from the last few days.

738
00:58:08,536 --> 00:58:13,056
Nicky handled all of that.
I expect they're around somewhere.

739
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,976
So who would want him dead?

740
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:19,056
He was very good at making enemies.

741
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:21,056
Especially when he was drunk.

742
00:58:24,176 --> 00:58:26,776
The night Geoffrey Larkin
was killed.

743
00:58:26,776 --> 00:58:28,656
In the hay loft...

744
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:30,576
..to who...to whom...

745
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:33,296
..were you making love?

746
00:58:33,296 --> 00:58:35,176
We've got THAT DVD.

747
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:39,376
You tell me.

748
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:43,096
It was dark. We couldn't see
the other...participant.

749
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:47,296
It was Nicky, of course.

750
00:58:49,136 --> 00:58:52,136
It was...one of the games
we used to play.

751
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:56,136
Secret assignations,
naughty fantasies...

752
00:58:56,136 --> 00:58:59,936
..never...really letting anyone know
what was going on.

753
00:59:01,096 --> 00:59:03,056
Berlin.

754
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,336
I didn't know anything.

755
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:10,936
But you were there.

756
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:13,456
We were just young operatives,
Mr Barnaby.

757
00:59:14,536 --> 00:59:17,616
Did as we were told.
Never saw the whole picture.

758
00:59:17,616 --> 00:59:19,616
I find that hard to believe.

759
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:23,216
Sorry.

760
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:27,056
If I could have your full attention,
please, Sir.

761
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:33,096
Sergeant Jones, I called Barnaby in
to aid me on...certain matters.

762
00:59:33,096 --> 00:59:36,336
It is with him, and him alone,

763
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:38,216
I will be communicating.

764
00:59:39,056 --> 00:59:41,056
Excuse me.

765
00:59:41,056 --> 00:59:45,736
Well, I'm afraid that's slightly at
odds with what DCI Barnaby told me.

766
00:59:45,736 --> 00:59:48,416
He asked me to talk to you
as you were...

767
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:51,616
..'small fry...'

768
00:59:51,616 --> 00:59:56,656
What? '..an MI6 office boy
of no particular importance.'

769
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,336
Did he get that wrong?

770
01:00:02,576 --> 01:00:07,696
Jarvis says he was asleep by 11.
Didn't wake up until Jenny
discovered the body.

771
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:12,016
Jumpy as a cat, mind. That's cos
he might lose his job over this.

772
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:14,896
Oh, that would be a shame (!)

773
01:00:14,896 --> 01:00:16,976
Sir Malcolm and Mrs Frazer?

774
01:00:16,976 --> 01:00:22,336
Even when vulnerable, years
of training have made obfuscation
second nature to them.

775
01:00:22,336 --> 01:00:27,336
So you didn't get much?
Nope. Have to squeeze the fruit
further up the food chain.

776
01:00:27,336 --> 01:00:29,176
What shall I do?

777
01:00:32,176 --> 01:00:33,936
What did you make of that?

778
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:37,496
Nothing.

779
01:00:37,496 --> 01:00:41,256
Thieves that don't thieve?
Vandals have a change of heart?

780
01:00:41,256 --> 01:00:43,656
No-one breaks in for no reason.

781
01:00:43,656 --> 01:00:46,096
It brings on a policeman's reflux.

782
01:00:47,256 --> 01:00:49,936
He's like that. Instinctive.
Irritating.

783
01:00:50,616 --> 01:00:55,776
He has decided that
someone broke in for a reason,
so I have to find the reason.

784
01:00:55,776 --> 01:00:58,656
So you didn't just come back
to see me?

785
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,456
No.
Not at all?

786
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,936
Would you concentrate, please?

787
01:01:02,936 --> 01:01:07,776
Come on. There's a stack of stuff back here
that's never been catalogued.

788
01:01:07,776 --> 01:01:11,016
This one had been broken open.
What's in there?

789
01:01:11,016 --> 01:01:14,176
Animal skulls, bones
and general bits.

790
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:16,176
But mainly skulls.

791
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,656
Hyena, I think. 

792
01:01:18,656 --> 01:01:21,016
So what's missing?

793
01:01:21,016 --> 01:01:24,456
I'm not sure, but there's
an empty specimen bag here.

794
01:01:24,456 --> 01:01:26,496
Hey, no, no, no, don't touch.

795
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:33,456
I didn't report it cos I thought
who'd want an old skull?

796
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:39,896
Sheep shit.

797
01:02:00,576 --> 01:02:02,456
Seth?

798
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:07,656
Seth?

799
01:02:10,976 --> 01:02:13,496
Berlin, in the early 80s, Brenda.

800
01:02:14,216 --> 01:02:16,096
What went down?

801
01:02:16,096 --> 01:02:18,016
Nothing to do with you.

802
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:21,696
My chief tells me
that I have full powers.

803
01:02:22,736 --> 01:02:25,456
And my chief, me, says you don't.

804
01:02:27,056 --> 01:02:28,976
I could have you arrested.

805
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:30,856
No, you couldn't.

806
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:35,616
I could have arrested your daughter.

807
01:02:35,616 --> 01:02:37,656
Below the belt, Barnaby.

808
01:02:37,656 --> 01:02:40,536
Well, I hauled Charlotte
out of that squat,

809
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:42,776
I thumped
her crack-head boyfriend,

810
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:47,256
and I sent her home to you because
I thought you were a decent person

811
01:02:47,256 --> 01:02:49,896
trying to do your best
for your country.

812
01:02:50,736 --> 01:02:52,776
And I still am.

813
01:02:52,776 --> 01:02:56,336
No, you're not, Brenda.
You're just like the Frazers.

814
01:02:56,336 --> 01:02:59,256
Still locked in that cold war
hocus pocus.

815
01:02:59,256 --> 01:03:02,936
It meant little then,
it means absolutely nothing now.

816
01:03:02,936 --> 01:03:06,816
Apart from the fact you are impeding
a murder investigation.

817
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,376
I will not allow that to happen.

818
01:03:09,376 --> 01:03:16,056
So please answer my question or I'll
personally take you to a small cell
and beat the truth out of you.

819
01:03:20,616 --> 01:03:23,016
When the wall was still up...

820
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:26,976
..we had a little team of
specialists working under Malcolm.

821
01:03:26,976 --> 01:03:30,056
His son Nicky, wife Jenny...and
Jimmy Wells.

822
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,176
We got a lot of people out.

823
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:34,256
Until there was a leak.

824
01:03:34,256 --> 01:03:36,256
A betrayal.

825
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:38,536
And the whole thing unravelled.

826
01:03:38,536 --> 01:03:42,656
And Anglo-Russian relations
took a quite spectacular dive.

827
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:45,376
Did you find out
who the traitor was? No.

828
01:03:45,376 --> 01:03:50,536
So it all left a nasty taste in the corporate 
mouth and a few careers stalled.

829
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:52,416
Including Malcolm's.

830
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:57,056
You should have stuck with us, Tom.

831
01:03:57,056 --> 01:03:59,976
Your life could have been
equally fruitless.

832
01:04:04,576 --> 01:04:06,576
Oh, come on!

833
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:09,816
Think, think, think, think, think.

834
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:11,696
Ah.

835
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,296
Nice one, Seth.

836
01:04:51,459 --> 01:04:56,899
It's been washed but we should be
able to find traces of blood in the crevices.

837
01:04:56,899 --> 01:04:59,579
Yes, definitely the murder weapon.

838
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:03,059
And what kind of creature
has a skull like that?

839
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:05,579
It's from the felidae,
or cat family.

840
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:07,899
Cat? Pussy cat?

841
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:11,219
 Sabre-toothed cat
of Northern Chad.

842
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:15,939
They were about the size of a lion
and had huge projecting fangs.

843
01:05:15,939 --> 01:05:20,459
They still around? They say one
was shot on the Ivory Coast in 1975.

844
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:23,659
It was officially identified
as a mutant jaguar.

845
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,579
And that is what this is?

846
01:05:27,379 --> 01:05:29,579
No.

847
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:33,499
Actually, I think this is a
prehistoric smilodon fatalis.

848
01:05:34,379 --> 01:05:40,539
They found a lot of them in
the La Brea tarpits in Los Angeles.
There's one in most museums.

849
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:43,019
But it has nothing to do
with any animal

850
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:45,419
that was ever seen in Midsomer?

851
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,859
Not this side of the last ice age.

852
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,459
All right.

853
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:54,059
He's not in his shack by the pub.

854
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:56,819
Hasn't been seen since yesterday -
Sir...

855
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:01,579
Seth! Seth!

856
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:04,259
Can we have a word, please?

857
01:06:08,659 --> 01:06:11,139
He's doing a runner.
On a tractor.

858
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:13,459
On a tractor. Get after him.
Right.

859
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:34,459
Seth, what are you doing?

860
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,779
Seth, why don't you just stop?

861
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:42,899
Seth.

862
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:48,219
Oof!

863
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,619
Well done, Jones!

864
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,739
You're under arrest.

865
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:20,979
That were amazing.

866
01:07:20,979 --> 01:07:23,099
Good.

867
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,419
The things you do...
Yeah, yeah.

868
01:07:25,419 --> 01:07:28,339
How did you learn them things?
I took classes.

869
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:30,259
Payment, please.

870
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,259
Ooh.

871
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:49,819
You're very sweet.

872
01:08:33,099 --> 01:08:35,179
No!

873
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:37,899
My car! Oh! Oh, my car!

874
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:39,779
My car!

875
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:47,299
Yes, a very sort of town/country
metaphor, that, isn't it?

876
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:51,739
Inspector, aren't you gonna
do anything?

877
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:53,619
Inspector? Inspector!

878
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:56,339
Oh, no!

879
01:08:56,339 --> 01:09:00,019
What was the murder weapon
doing in your shearing shed?

880
01:09:00,019 --> 01:09:02,379
Weapon?
The skull with the fangs.

881
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:05,059
Did you kill those people?
No!

882
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:07,739
They were killed with your skull.
Not mine.

883
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:11,259
Of the beast. Skull of the beast.
That's crap, Seth.

884
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:19,099
You stole the skull from the museum
then started this beast rumour
to cover your tracks.

885
01:09:19,099 --> 01:09:22,859
Come on, Seth, spit it out.
Get it off your chest. Jones...

886
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,579
Seth!
Jones.

887
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:29,019
Seth...

888
01:09:29,019 --> 01:09:30,899
..Seth...

889
01:09:31,419 --> 01:09:33,579
Can't be much fun, can it?

890
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:36,659
Living in a shack
at the back of the pub.

891
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:40,739
And there's not much money in lamb
these days, is there? No.

892
01:09:40,739 --> 01:09:43,459
So a chap might need
a bit of an earner.

893
01:09:44,299 --> 01:09:46,499
So how much do you get paid

894
01:09:46,499 --> 01:09:50,499
for being the one and only expert
on the beast of Midsomer?

895
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:53,819
They done it. Loch Ness.

896
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:56,499
Monster this, monster that.

897
01:09:56,499 --> 01:09:59,659
Money in the till.
And there ain't no monster.

898
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:01,939
And there isn't a beast.

899
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:07,499
But isn't it going a bit far,
killing people to make your story
sound credible?

900
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:09,739
That weren't me.

901
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:15,979
Honest. Someone stole that skull.
Done them things, put it back,
make it look as if it were me.

902
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,619
I wouldn't kill anyone!
Listen... Jones.

903
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:26,739
Come here.

904
01:10:32,379 --> 01:10:37,819
Cinch. Seth hasn't got the mental faculties
to organise a complex murder plot.

905
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:41,459
Smart enough to manipulate the
media. Any fool can do that.

906
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:45,179
But, Sir... And Jones, I've
checked the pub CCTV camera.

907
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:50,499
Seth was either helping
behind the bar or in his shack
at the time of both murders.

908
01:10:50,499 --> 01:10:55,859
Thanks for keeping me in the loop(!)
SETH: I got more of them...
film things for you.

909
01:11:00,259 --> 01:11:03,619
It's very difficult to lip-read
at that distance.

910
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:05,859
Just do the best you can, Alice.

911
01:11:07,259 --> 01:11:09,179
Berlin Wall...

912
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:11,259
..East German something...

913
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,539
..wolf...Wolfman.

914
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:24,659
British Embassy...

915
01:11:25,499 --> 01:11:27,499
..would it...something...

916
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:33,499
And the other one says, I don't,
something, something traitors.

917
01:11:37,019 --> 01:11:38,779
Is that a coffin?

918
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:47,379
Never liked the idea
of being a corpse.

919
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:49,019
No.

920
01:11:49,019 --> 01:11:50,899
That's my wife there. Gwenny.

921
01:11:51,419 --> 01:11:53,579
She's with our Nicky now.

922
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:55,459
I'm sure she is.

923
01:11:56,299 --> 01:11:58,219
Grim stuff.

924
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:01,499
So what did you want?

925
01:12:01,499 --> 01:12:04,299
Why did you call Geoffrey Larkin
a traitor?

926
01:12:04,299 --> 01:12:08,499
Told you. Cos he was a bent little
sharpie. But that's not a traitor.

927
01:12:08,499 --> 01:12:11,099
He lined his pockets
with blood money.

928
01:12:11,099 --> 01:12:13,299
That's a betrayal of mankind.

929
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:15,499
And Wolfman?

930
01:12:15,499 --> 01:12:18,819
That was the name of the file
we kept on him.

931
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:21,019
Yes, appropriate, too.

932
01:12:21,019 --> 01:12:24,419
Now, are you telling me
the truth, here, Sir Malcolm?

933
01:12:24,419 --> 01:12:26,459
What is truth, Barnaby?

934
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:28,539
It's like love.

935
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:30,619
One man's truth...

936
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:32,499
..is another man's...

937
01:12:35,259 --> 01:12:37,179
..something or other.

938
01:12:42,579 --> 01:12:47,059
Sir M making any sense?
No. And lying through his teeth.

939
01:12:47,059 --> 01:12:52,979
It's physiological when some people
lie. They tighten their nostrils
or narrow their pupils.

940
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:59,099
Sir Malcolm was doing both. But
he's so close to going over the edge,
I didn't want to push it.

941
01:12:59,099 --> 01:13:01,099
They're all stalling.
Yeah.

942
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:05,219
So let us insert some ninja
into the appropriate orifices,

943
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:07,699
and see if we can make the horses
dance.

944
01:13:08,299 --> 01:13:10,099
What?

945
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:26,234
I can't talk to you about all that
back stuff. They'd string me up.

946
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:29,434
What if I told you 'the boss'
said it was OK.

947
01:13:29,434 --> 01:13:32,434
You don't even know
who the boss is.

948
01:13:33,434 --> 01:13:35,674
You through, Jones?
Yes, Sir.

949
01:13:41,914 --> 01:13:43,954
Good God.
Correct, Jimmy.

950
01:13:43,954 --> 01:13:45,914
Sit down.

951
01:13:47,634 --> 01:13:49,794
You look as shifty as ever.

952
01:13:49,794 --> 01:13:51,914
Yes, Mrs Packard.

953
01:13:51,914 --> 01:13:57,234
Now, cooperate fully -
repeat, fully - with Mr Barnaby,

954
01:13:57,234 --> 01:14:01,234
or I'll have you in Belmarsh
before you can say code six.

955
01:14:01,914 --> 01:14:03,914
Goodbye, Jimmy.

956
01:14:08,434 --> 01:14:11,114
Respect.
Right. Berlin.

957
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:16,794
You were...part of a team that
got people across the wall, right?

958
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:19,314
Yeah. They...

959
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:22,354
..got me in because
I was a mechanic's whizz.

960
01:14:22,354 --> 01:14:27,194
Got a whole family out
on a home-made balloon.
Another bloke on a flying fox.

961
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:29,234
But...tunnels was the best.

962
01:14:29,234 --> 01:14:31,314
How long did this go on for?

963
01:14:31,314 --> 01:14:33,234
Oh...couple of years.

964
01:14:34,114 --> 01:14:36,554
Then one day it all went arse up.

965
01:14:37,794 --> 01:14:40,074
Go on.

966
01:14:40,074 --> 01:14:43,394
It was a good tunnel.
(Schnell. Machst du schnell.)

967
01:14:44,074 --> 01:14:47,034
We'd got half a dozen people
down that one.

968
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:58,114
(Schnell, schnell.)
It was a kid that day.

969
01:15:00,354 --> 01:15:02,354
But they were onto us.

970
01:15:02,754 --> 01:15:04,594
Someone must have blabbed.

971
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:13,794
And what did they do to you?

972
01:15:15,274 --> 01:15:17,274
Water boarding.

973
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:19,794
Water boarding?

974
01:15:28,634 --> 01:15:31,274
(Genug Gehabt?)

975
01:15:31,274 --> 01:15:34,354
Those blokes were 20 years ahead
of the Yanks.

976
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:39,474
I told them everything
they wanted to know, so...

977
01:15:39,474 --> 01:15:41,474
..the whole op was blown.

978
01:15:41,474 --> 01:15:43,514
Then what happened to you?

979
01:15:43,514 --> 01:15:46,114
Three years in a Dresden slammer...

980
01:15:46,114 --> 01:15:48,754
..before our people done a deal.

981
01:15:48,754 --> 01:15:51,594
And did you go on
working for 'the company?'

982
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:54,674
Surprisingly not,
Mr Barnaby.

983
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:59,274
No, they gave me enough money
to start up the biz here,

984
01:15:59,274 --> 01:16:04,394
and told me to keep schtum,
or they'd nail my knackers
to the church tower.

985
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:08,314
Did you ever find out who it was
that betrayed you all?

986
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,314
No.

987
01:16:10,314 --> 01:16:12,274
I still await that pleasure.

988
01:16:14,754 --> 01:16:16,754
Do we buy all that?

989
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:20,114
Some. Maybe we should rely
on ACTUAL evidence.

990
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:22,074
What do you have in mind?

991
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:26,714
Well, Gail and I have been looking
at the CCTV stuff. Ooh, she's keen.

992
01:16:27,514 --> 01:16:29,434
So am I.

993
01:16:36,674 --> 01:16:38,874
Saintly?

994
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:41,594
Or...standing to attention?

995
01:16:45,074 --> 01:16:47,154
What? (MUFFLED) Who did that?

996
01:16:48,634 --> 01:16:50,594
Who's there?!

997
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:59,914
What are you doing?!

998
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:02,314
What's going on?!

999
01:17:02,954 --> 01:17:05,834
See, Sir,
Larkin's first night there,

1000
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:09,474
Jenny Frazer comes down the stairs
in her dressing gown,

1001
01:17:09,474 --> 01:17:11,554
then there's a gap, see?

1002
01:17:12,474 --> 01:17:14,834
Then she goes out the front door.

1003
01:17:16,394 --> 01:17:20,354
So why isn't the main part
of the hallway covered as well?

1004
01:17:21,594 --> 01:17:23,634
Then there's Nicky.

1005
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,994
Now where is he?

1006
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,674
Yeah, where?
We don't know.

1007
01:17:30,674 --> 01:17:34,634
There's no coverage on that side
of the building, either.

1008
01:17:34,634 --> 01:17:40,034
So anyone can go in and out
without being observed.
If they knew what the coverage was.

1009
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:42,474
I was gonna say that actual thing.

1010
01:17:42,474 --> 01:17:45,354
But you were taking too long,
Detective Jones.

1011
01:17:45,354 --> 01:17:47,674
Well done, Detective Stephens.

1012
01:17:47,674 --> 01:17:49,554
Thank you, Sir.

1013
01:17:57,514 --> 01:17:59,714
Reg, Sir Malcolm about?

1014
01:17:59,714 --> 01:18:01,914
Haven't seen him, Sir.
Mrs Frazer?

1015
01:18:01,914 --> 01:18:03,834
Gone shopping.
What about Jarvis?

1016
01:18:04,594 --> 01:18:06,954
Around somewhere, I guess.
Oh, yeah.

1017
01:18:14,714 --> 01:18:17,354
No-one up there, Sir.
And he's not in there.

1018
01:18:17,354 --> 01:18:19,234
Oh, no, no. Wait a sec.

1019
01:18:23,354 --> 01:18:26,074
Not here.
Nor is his box.

1020
01:18:28,914 --> 01:18:31,034
(BANGING)
What are you doing?!

1021
01:18:35,114 --> 01:18:37,034
He-e-e-e-e-e-elp!

1022
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:47,074
Still warm.

1023
01:18:47,474 --> 01:18:49,594
He must be here somewhere.

1024
01:18:49,594 --> 01:18:51,514
I'm sorry, what?

1025
01:18:51,514 --> 01:18:53,394
Jarvis.
What about Jarvis?

1026
01:18:53,394 --> 01:18:55,634
He's the obvious suspect.

1027
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:57,874
Why do you say that?

1028
01:18:57,874 --> 01:19:01,074
Because he's the only one left?

1029
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:03,554
Oh, that'll sound good in court (!)

1030
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:06,674
What are you doing?

1031
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:10,234
Where have you been, Sir?
Fixing the wing of my car.

1032
01:19:10,234 --> 01:19:15,154
Have you seen Sir Malcolm?
He was working on his coffin
about half-an-hour ago.

1033
01:19:15,154 --> 01:19:19,874
Sir Malcolm isn't here,
the coffin isn't here,
but the Range Rover IS here.

1034
01:19:19,874 --> 01:19:23,074
So how did he move the coffin
from the premises?

1035
01:19:24,234 --> 01:19:26,194
So...should...shall I...?

1036
01:19:27,874 --> 01:19:31,074
The question is not how but whom.
I've got it.

1037
01:19:31,554 --> 01:19:33,554
The cricket club.

1038
01:19:37,114 --> 01:19:39,034
Practise session.

1039
01:19:39,834 --> 01:19:43,114
I was sitting here.
Jimmy had hit me with a bouncer.

1040
01:19:43,114 --> 01:19:45,114
Yeah, go on.

1041
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:49,274
Jenny Frazer made a circle
on a car window with her finger.

1042
01:19:51,434 --> 01:19:53,954
Then she made a mark in the circle.

1043
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:56,354
Clock code.
Whereabouts in the circle?

1044
01:19:57,914 --> 01:19:59,954
Centre top.
Centre top.

1045
01:19:59,954 --> 01:20:01,914
Midday or midnight.

1046
01:20:01,914 --> 01:20:04,034
Whose car was it, do you know?

1047
01:20:08,674 --> 01:20:10,634
It had trade plates on it.

1048
01:20:10,634 --> 01:20:14,394
I don't know what you're on about.
Yes, you do, Jimmy.

1049
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:17,834
You were or are having an affair
with Jenny Frazer.

1050
01:20:17,834 --> 01:20:21,274
Nope. It's not a crime, Jimmy,
you don't have to lie.

1051
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,914
We're not here to nick you
for anything.

1052
01:20:23,914 --> 01:20:27,634
Overcome your natural instincts
and tell us the truth.

1053
01:20:27,634 --> 01:20:29,994
I deny everything.

1054
01:20:29,994 --> 01:20:35,274
Jenny left a message on one
of your cars at the cricket club.
Meet her at midnight.

1055
01:20:35,274 --> 01:20:40,434
We have a video. The pair of you
going at it hammer and tongs.
You got visuals?

1056
01:20:40,434 --> 01:20:42,234
Yes.
Why didn't you say?

1057
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:44,274
Where is she?

1058
01:20:44,274 --> 01:20:46,474
I don't know.

1059
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,634
Jimmy, have you lent her a vehicle
lately?

1060
01:20:49,634 --> 01:20:52,554
Something big enough
to hold a long box?

1061
01:20:58,274 --> 01:21:00,314
SIR MALCOLM: (MUFFLED) Hello?

1062
01:21:01,594 --> 01:21:03,514
Hello?

1063
01:21:04,314 --> 01:21:07,914
She can't help it, you know.
She was trained for it.

1064
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:10,114
Trained for what?
Work it out, son.

1065
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:12,834
Ah. The hearse is gone.

1066
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,754
Harry! You grubby little beggar!

1067
01:21:15,754 --> 01:21:18,514
What? So you think you're a man,
do ya?

1068
01:21:18,514 --> 01:21:21,634
You grubby little sod!
I think we'd better move on.

1069
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:46,994
Causton Crematorium,
everyone available.

1070
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:08,594
SIR MALCOLM: (MUFFLED) Help!

1071
01:22:14,114 --> 01:22:17,634
As we commit Malcolm Frazer
to the flames,

1072
01:22:17,634 --> 01:22:20,714
let us remember
what he meant to all of us.

1073
01:22:20,714 --> 01:22:25,394
An evil, manipulative, uncaring man,

1074
01:22:25,394 --> 01:22:28,954
who is finally getting
what he so richly deserves.

1075
01:22:30,794 --> 01:22:32,714
Help!

1076
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:41,754
Round the back!

1077
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,314
Ooh!

1078
01:23:03,874 --> 01:23:05,994
Jones!

1079
01:23:08,034 --> 01:23:10,074
Jones!

1080
01:23:10,074 --> 01:23:12,154
Jones!

1081
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,114
The bolts! Undo the bolts!

1082
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:28,994
# Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,

1083
01:23:28,994 --> 01:23:33,514
# Feed me now and evermore,
evermo-o-o-o-o-ore

1084
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:36,034
# Feed me now and evermore,
evermo-o-o-o-o-ore

1085
01:23:36,034 --> 01:23:41,154
# Feed me till I want no more #

1086
01:23:41,154 --> 01:23:42,834
# Feed me till I want no more #

1087
01:23:46,394 --> 01:23:48,514
It's all right, darling.

1088
01:23:50,514 --> 01:23:52,394
It's all right.

1089
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:00,954
She didn't mean nothing.

1090
01:24:00,954 --> 01:24:03,714
She's just a bit upset after Nicky.

1091
01:24:03,714 --> 01:24:08,314
She's murdered two people and she's
just attempted to kill a third.

1092
01:24:08,314 --> 01:24:10,394
Nah, you've got it wrong.
Jenny?

1093
01:24:11,794 --> 01:24:13,874
Jenny?

1094
01:24:13,874 --> 01:24:15,794
Berlin.

1095
01:24:15,794 --> 01:24:17,954
All those years ago?

1096
01:24:17,954 --> 01:24:23,474
You and Jimmy were running the escape
routes from East Berlin, weren't you?

1097
01:24:23,474 --> 01:24:27,394
And the shared risk, shared
excitement threw you together.

1098
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:32,994
Whilst Nicky was organising
the West Berlin end of things.

1099
01:24:32,994 --> 01:24:35,034
But...

1100
01:24:35,034 --> 01:24:37,354
..someone betrayed you that day.

1101
01:24:39,114 --> 01:24:42,274
Did you ever suspect
that it was Nicky?
(Jetzt.)

1102
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:46,074
(Ech Verstanden. Achtung! Los!)
(Jawohl!)

1103
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:48,914
No.

1104
01:24:48,914 --> 01:24:50,834
We were a close team.

1105
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:53,714
He was really sympathetic.

1106
01:24:55,314 --> 01:24:59,594
Especially when he told me that
Jimmy had died in the East.

1107
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,634
Who told you?

1108
01:25:01,634 --> 01:25:03,394
Malcolm and Nicky.

1109
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:05,234
And you believed them?

1110
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:07,154
Why would they lie?

1111
01:25:09,274 --> 01:25:11,154
And you married Nicky.

1112
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:13,634
A year later.

1113
01:25:14,514 --> 01:25:16,394
I wasn't in love with him.

1114
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:22,034
But Nicky and Malcolm
were like my...my family by then.

1115
01:25:26,194 --> 01:25:28,394
Nicky wasn't up to much in bed.

1116
01:25:29,794 --> 01:25:32,274
Not much fun for a young woman,
so...

1117
01:25:35,354 --> 01:25:37,314
..I diversified.

1118
01:25:41,194 --> 01:25:44,314
Not many secrets
in the Brit community there...

1119
01:25:44,954 --> 01:25:48,394
..so word of my behaviour
soon...got around.

1120
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:52,114
Malcolm called me in.

1121
01:25:52,674 --> 01:25:54,914
Said he understood my feelings...

1122
01:25:55,674 --> 01:25:57,914
..and Nicky's failings.

1123
01:25:57,914 --> 01:26:01,514
But instead of upsetting
the apple cart by leaving...

1124
01:26:03,194 --> 01:26:08,434
..why didn't I use
my obvious skills and inclinations
to serve my country?

1125
01:26:09,994 --> 01:26:11,994
Mrs Honey Trap.

1126
01:26:13,074 --> 01:26:14,994
Whoring for England.

1127
01:26:14,994 --> 01:26:17,474
Making a virtue out of my hobby.

1128
01:26:19,994 --> 01:26:22,914
Felt about as cheap
as a bag of flour.

1129
01:26:26,034 --> 01:26:28,074
We came back to Allenby,

1130
01:26:28,074 --> 01:26:30,114
and I settled for a life of...

1131
01:26:30,714 --> 01:26:32,674
..frustration...

1132
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:35,274
..compromise...

1133
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,154
..depression.

1134
01:26:39,074 --> 01:26:42,154
But then Jimmy came back
from the dead.

1135
01:26:43,834 --> 01:26:45,994
Horrible home life but...

1136
01:26:45,994 --> 01:26:47,874
..a lover to keep me happy.

1137
01:26:48,674 --> 01:26:50,994
Until Geoffrey Larkin turned up.

1138
01:26:53,794 --> 01:26:59,594
It was you who supervised
and controlled the security systems
at Allenby, wasn't it?

1139
01:26:59,594 --> 01:27:05,874
Malcolm and Nicky were useless at
anything practical or mechanical,
so they were my toys.

1140
01:27:08,114 --> 01:27:12,034
(I recently came across one old file
marked...Wolfman.

1141
01:27:12,874 --> 01:27:15,034
Hello? You've gone all pale.

1142
01:27:16,194 --> 01:27:19,274
Blood pressure
having a bit of a plummet?

1143
01:27:19,274 --> 01:27:21,954
Would you like that file,
Sir Malcolm?)

1144
01:27:21,954 --> 01:27:25,514
BARNABY: But it was you
who really wanted that file.

1145
01:27:35,994 --> 01:27:37,994
Then finally...

1146
01:27:37,994 --> 01:27:41,354
..finally...you got to know
the real Berlin story.

1147
01:27:45,314 --> 01:27:47,194
(Jimmy.)

1148
01:27:48,594 --> 01:27:50,514
Malcolm...

1149
01:27:50,514 --> 01:27:52,434
..and Nicky...

1150
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,114
..they were the real traitors.

1151
01:27:57,234 --> 01:28:00,434
They had a deal going
with a Stasi officer.

1152
01:28:00,434 --> 01:28:04,474
They'd get people over the wall
for massive backhanders.

1153
01:28:04,474 --> 01:28:08,914
Some of them were legit good guys,
but most of them were crooks.

1154
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:14,514
Black marketeers, Soviet thugs,
anybody with money could
buy a ticket on the MI6 express.

1155
01:28:14,514 --> 01:28:16,714
No wonder they set you up.

1156
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:20,274
But why didn't you tell me
about the bleedin' file, Jen?

1157
01:28:20,274 --> 01:28:22,434
Because, Jimmy...

1158
01:28:22,434 --> 01:28:25,754
..if she could get rid of Nicky
and Malcolm Frazer,

1159
01:28:25,754 --> 01:28:28,434
then guess who would inherit Allenby?

1160
01:28:28,434 --> 01:28:30,434
Jen?

1161
01:28:30,954 --> 01:28:34,754
You two could have lived
happily together couldn't you?

1162
01:28:34,754 --> 01:28:39,714
But not with Geoffrey Larkin about,
because he knew what was in
the Wolfman file,

1163
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,914
and he'd be pointing the finger.

1164
01:28:41,914 --> 01:28:43,794
So he had to go.

1165
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:49,514
And then you thought you'd piggyback

1166
01:28:49,514 --> 01:28:52,474
on Seth Comfort's
ridiculous beast scam.

1167
01:28:55,634 --> 01:28:57,754
Borrowed the skull, did you?

1168
01:28:57,754 --> 01:29:00,194
And overcame a big guy like Larkin?

1169
01:29:00,194 --> 01:29:02,074
Easy. He was a man.

1170
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,794
(Someone there?)

1171
01:29:18,714 --> 01:29:21,314
(I thought you might fancy
a nightcap.)

1172
01:29:22,754 --> 01:29:24,914
(I thought I'd read you right.)

1173
01:29:25,434 --> 01:29:27,354
(Almost.)

1174
01:29:39,714 --> 01:29:43,834
So you disguised the wound
by tearing it with the skull.

1175
01:29:43,834 --> 01:29:45,914
Yes.
Nice.

1176
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:48,994
BARNABY: And Nicky
was even easier, wasn't he?

1177
01:29:48,994 --> 01:29:51,154
Cos Nicky, as usual, was drunk.

1178
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:53,354
(What?)

1179
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,274
Never knew what hit him.

1180
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:01,234
Oh, dear God.

1181
01:30:02,354 --> 01:30:04,274
Jimmy, they deserved it.

1182
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:06,154
No, no, Jenny.

1183
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:09,114
I don't think so.

1184
01:30:12,594 --> 01:30:14,474
Shall we go?

1185
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:42,394
Very professional.

1186
01:30:42,394 --> 01:30:45,234
Ah, there's a compliment.
Thank you, Sir.

1187
01:30:45,234 --> 01:30:47,794
You're not leaving us, are you?
Obviously.

1188
01:30:47,794 --> 01:30:49,754
New posting?

1189
01:30:49,754 --> 01:30:54,154
Yes, global warming has opened up
the Arctic. North West Passage.

1190
01:30:54,154 --> 01:30:57,634
I'll be monitoring
the, er...shipping traffic.

1191
01:30:57,634 --> 01:31:00,914
Ooh. Very important.
Yes, it is important. Yes, it is.

1192
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:02,914
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1193
01:31:02,914 --> 01:31:04,834
Ah...

1194
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,794
I wish you a good day.

1195
01:31:13,394 --> 01:31:15,434
Are you smiling, Sir?

1196
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:20,474
No, certainly not. I'm not the petty,
spiteful, vindictive sort. (LAUGHS

1197
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:30,154
Yes, innings.

1198
01:31:31,674 --> 01:31:33,714
And again.

1199
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:46,754
Brenda.

1200
01:31:47,474 --> 01:31:49,554
They're having this re-match...

1201
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:51,754
..as a decider...

1202
01:31:51,754 --> 01:31:54,354
..But we can leave
before the punch-up.

1203
01:31:56,554 --> 01:31:58,474
How's HE coming along?

1204
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:03,154
Remarkably well...

1205
01:32:03,154 --> 01:32:06,314
..for one who's lived through
his own cremation.

1206
01:32:06,314 --> 01:32:08,714
He deserves to be roasted alive...

1207
01:32:09,514 --> 01:32:12,834
..and when he returns
from the twilight zone...

1208
01:32:12,834 --> 01:32:14,874
..I'll have him locked up.

1209
01:32:14,874 --> 01:32:16,754
Better to remain insane.

1210
01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:20,314
Probably.

1211
01:32:20,314 --> 01:32:22,994
Well, I'll tell him.
Keep on gibbering.

1212
01:32:24,554 --> 01:32:27,034
You always were a bit of a bolshie.

1213
01:32:40,514 --> 01:32:42,874
Your chappie's been clobbered.
Yes.

1214
01:32:46,274 --> 01:32:48,234
What a shame.

1215
01:33:04,394 --> 01:33:06,314
