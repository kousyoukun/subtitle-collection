00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,159
MAN: No! Please, no! No!

2
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:23,319
No! Please! No! No!

3
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,239
(CONTINUES WAILING)

4
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,999
CHEERING

5
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,679
BOOING

6
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,839
(WAILS) No!

7
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,519
No!

8
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:18,387
MAN: Cut!

9
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,867
Cut.
OK, reset, everybody.

10
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,307
Reset. We're running out of blood.

11
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:43,267
BLEEPS

12
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:49,707
I've got something interesting, sir.
I'm tailing George Ince.

13
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:51,827
BARNABY: George Ince? Really?

14
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:56,187
'Yeah, it's definitely him.'
That is not good news.

15
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:58,787
With a bit of luck, he'll drive onto
someone else's patch.

16
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:10,347
And he's heading towards
Midsomer Magna.

17
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,987
Then, Jones, it falls to us
to protect

18
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:17,027
the wealthier citizens of Midsomer
from Mr Ince's thieving ways.

19
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:30,907
(CLEARS THROAT
AND MUTTERS TO HIMSELF)

20
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:42,747
How does this sound? "It is a
little-known fact that, in 1905,

21
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:45,787
the Hungarian aristocrat and writer,
Baroness Orczy,

22
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:49,387
was a guest of Lord Fitzgibbon
at Midsomer Magna Manor."

23
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:55,427
What's wrong?
Neville, don't. Please.

24
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:57,427
You could have let me finish.

25
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,427
You were going to say the woman who
wrote the Scarlet Pimpernel

26
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:04,547
based the character of Sir Percy
Blakeney on Lord Fitzgibbon,

27
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:07,427
who owned Magna Manor at the turn
of the last century.

28
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,187
Well...yes.

29
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:13,787
We know she never went near the
place, never mind met his Lordship.

30
00:03:13,787 --> 00:03:15,787
WE know that.

31
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:19,267
Given that they're filming that very
book in the grounds of the manor,

32
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,867
don't you think it'll be a tad
obvious to everyone else?

33
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:25,147
You're right.

34
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:30,107
The occasional embellishment
to the history of a place,

35
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:33,667
I mean, everyone does that.
But Terence Charteris had no right

36
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,347
to ask you to lie to blatantly.

37
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:38,947
If I don't play along,
I lose the job.

38
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:41,587
Where else am I going to find work
in Midsomer Magna?

39
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:45,667
They're still hiring extras
on the film.

40
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,307
You could have a dip back into
the business, for old times' sake.

41
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:52,907
You obviously don't know
who's directing this film. Who?

44
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,187
Three, two, one, drop!

45
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:17,067
Cut it!

46
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,027
82, take 1.

47
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,267
And, action!

48
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,147
CHEERING

49
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,987
Cut it.

50
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:41,227
Nick, these execution scenes -
I know, I know.

51
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,187
Enough blood to float an abattoir.

52
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,507
I'll get special effects
to turn it down.

53
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:49,747
Good grief, no. If anything, we need
more blood. Buckets of the stuff.

54
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,107
Know your audience.

55
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:57,427
It's not as if you're directing
an art-house movie, is it?

56
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:12,427
Ah, Jones. So, Mr Ince is here.

57
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:15,027
They're opening the place
to the public, sir.

58
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:17,627
Apparently, it's got historic
connections

59
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,627
with the French Revolution.
Doing a film, aren't they?

60
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:22,467
The Scarlet Pimpernel.

61
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,347
What you might call a remake
of a remake of a remake.

62
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:28,547
Yes, Joyce mentioned something
about it. Where is he now?

63
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,747
Parked up round the side.

64
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,227
Your informant has got to be right
about Ince setting up a job.

65
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:37,027
What other interest could he have in
a stately home?

66
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:39,907
Maybe he's come for a dose of
culture and a guided tour.

67
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:43,267
Although George prefers to guide
himself round places like this.

68
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:47,867
And usually by torchlight when
there's no-one else about.
Let's find out what he's up to.

69
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:50,307
'Three, two, one, drop.

70
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,467
Cut it.
82, take 1.

71
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,187
Action.'

72
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:59,107
CROWD CHEERS

73
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:07,387
Something else not right about
that scene. Enlighten me.

74
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,467
Not enough peasants.
You want me to reshoot?

75
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,667
Oh, God, no. But for future scenes,
you'll need more crones and hags.

76
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:17,707
Crones and hags.
I'll see what I can conjure up.

77
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:20,827
Don't make hard work of it.
An area like this must be overrun

78
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:22,987
with yokels and inbreds.

79
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:26,307
Why don't you try the local
old folks' home. They'll come cheap.

80
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,907
'And drop.'

81
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:52,187
There he is.
Look who he's with.

82
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,027
Jed Norris!

83
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:55,947
Talk about thick as thieves, eh?

84
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:59,987
No, leave it, leave it.
You'll get nothing from him.

85
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,827
A word with Mr Norris might prove
more useful.

86
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:08,707
I can see exactly why you're
going for this heritage scam.

87
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:12,147
Do you have to use that word?
I'm joking, Diane.

88
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:17,027
No, I mean it certainly looks like
an authentic historical pile.

89
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:21,667
From what I gather it's getting more
authentically historical by the day.

90
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,587
(LAUGHS) Got a man working on it.

91
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,947
Local historian.

92
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,707
Historian?
Oh, you don't need one of them.

93
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:33,107
Dip into Hans Christian Andersen.
He was good with fairytales.

94
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,627
Listen, Terence...

95
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:41,547
I'm not sure how much more I can
take of Jack Braxton.

96
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:44,267
The man's a philistine.
Ooh!

97
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:48,067
You want the producer sacked, you'll
have to clear that with Diane.

98
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:52,867
Why's that?
Because they're very good friends.

99
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:55,787
I didn't even know you knew him.
He's being facetious.

100
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:58,667
I don't understand.
It may have escaped your notice,

101
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,827
but this marriage is on the rocks.

102
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:05,147
We're just trying to hold things
together till we get the business
off the ground.

103
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:07,307
So you and Braxton are er...

104
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:09,067
Close.
(SNORTS)

105
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:14,427
Ah!

106
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,307
Well, even so. He's a hatchet man.
Known for it.

107
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,387
He's the producer.
Money men have to be like that.

108
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:23,867
We want this film to look
as good as possible, don't we?

109
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,347
I mean...don't we?

110
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,267
Look, Nick...

111
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:36,707
I know you see this as a chance
to get your career back on track,

112
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:40,547
but to us it's just business, OK?

113
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,627
Right, well...thanks for putting me
in the picture.

114
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,147
I'd better get back to set.

115
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:50,387
Actors to execute.

116
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:52,467
I'll see you both tomorrow night,
then.

117
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,387
Keep up the good work.

118
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,667
I don't know how you can bear
that man in the house

119
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,667
after the way he's treated
our daughter.

120
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,587
How do you think Leonie feels
about this?

121
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:12,267
Diane, there's family
and there's business.

122
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:16,627
Right now, the family business
is in trouble. We need Nick Cheyney.

123
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:19,507
So Leonie's just gonna have to
lump it. All right?

124
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:40,467
Hello, Jed! I didn't think
you were due for release just yet.

125
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,107
Parole. Good behaviour.

126
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:45,347
Ah! Well, congratulations.

127
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:47,547
Yeah, I think they needed
the cell space.

128
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:50,627
I'm telling you, overcrowding in
prisons is criminal.

129
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:52,907
So it's not somewhere
you want to rush back to?

130
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,827
Never again.
I can't handle any more.

131
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,747
So why the meeting with George Ince?

132
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:58,947
It wasn't a meeting.

133
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:02,187
I just happened to bump into him.
Small world (!)

134
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:04,267
What's he doing here?

135
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,467
You don't ask people like George
their business.

136
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:10,467
No, you don't. Nasty piece of work.
So what are you doing at Magna Manor?

137
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:13,387
I'm working here.
You? Work!

138
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:15,987
That's right. Big laugh!

139
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:18,547
Excuse me.

140
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,467
Thank you.

141
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:25,507
No meeting between Jed Norris
and George Ince is coincidental.

142
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,467
Get hold of the management here.

143
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:30,027
If anything untoward happens,
I want to know about it.

144
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:32,307
Sir.

145
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,187
Can you get over to the props boys?

146
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:43,507
(GROANS) Nick, erm, these are the
old folk from The Cedars.

147
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:45,347
Crones and hags. As ordered.

148
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,227
Right. Well, get them fitted out
with rags.

149
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,707
I want them on set
at eight tomorrow morning.

150
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:55,787
Some of them are over 80,
Mr Cheyney.

151
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:58,387
(SIGHS) Nine, then.

152
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:04,307
It's a bit late. We've gotta get
the costumes ready...

153
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:06,027
Nick?

154
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:11,187
Gwen? Gwen Morrison?

155
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,107
You do remember me.

156
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,947
Always! But, uh...

157
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:17,587
Well, it must be what erm...

158
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:21,707
17 years.
No! No, not that long, surely.

159
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:25,387
Well, I've lived in this village
for 15 of them. Ever since Ted died.

160
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,427
Ted died?

161
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,347
So you're um...on your own, then?

162
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:35,587
No, no. I live with Neville.
You remember Neville.

163
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:38,027
(LAUGHS) Of course! Neville!

164
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,547
I might've known
he'd still be around.

165
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,547
Listen, darling,
I really can't talk now but, er...

166
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:47,427
I'll catch you later, all right?

167
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:50,147
Gwen Morrison.

168
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,187
WOMAN: Excuse me! Excuse me!

169
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:05,147
It's not as though you're asking me
to update the history of the Manor.

170
00:12:05,147 --> 00:12:07,227
That is exactly what I'm asking you
to do.

171
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,507
But what you want is pure fantasy.

172
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:13,187
Erm... Your point?

173
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,707
It's not ethical.

174
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:20,187
And it shouldn't be part of my remit
as Events Organiser of the Manor.

175
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:22,587
(SNORTS) Don't flatter yourself.

176
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:25,467
Part-time tour guide
was all you were ever gonna be.

177
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,627
Were?

178
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:30,307
I need to get this place
open to the public ASAP.

179
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,547
Till then,
I'm just haemorrhaging money.

180
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:35,307
So I can't afford to have losers
like you holding me back.

181
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:37,187
Go on, you're fired!

182
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,587
What're you waiting for?

183
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,547
Right, bye.

184
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:49,547
How come you're at Gwen's?
It was a bit chaotic today.

185
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,627
Ooh, sounds exciting.
It was.

186
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:54,107
We were up at The Cedars
on charity shop business

187
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,067
when someone came round
from the film unit

188
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,627
to recruit the old folk as extras.

189
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,787
They need more "crones and hags".

190
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:04,427
Crones? They actually used those
terms? Not that any of us minded.

191
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:07,787
Most of us are thrilled to bits
to be in The Scarlet Pimpernel.

192
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,587
Us? Gwen and I volunteered
to be chaperones,

193
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,027
so we thought we might as well be
extras too.

194
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,627
Following in your daughter's
footsteps, eh?

195
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,907
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
Oh, hello, Neville.

196
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:21,587
Jones? 'Sir, report of a prowler,
Magna Manor.'

197
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:24,187
You think it could be Ince?
'Looks like it, sir.'

198
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,827
Right, get yourself some back-up.
I'll be right there.

199
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,507
DOOR CLOSES

200
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:36,827
Well, I challenged him...
and he fired me.

201
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:41,067
A week before the place is due
to open to the public?

202
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:45,627
I've picked up on what's happening.

203
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:48,227
Terence Charteris may live in
a manor house,

204
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,627
but he's a barrow boy
out of his depth.

205
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,907
He's over-stretched himself
and he's about to go under.

206
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,987
I don't think he could afford
to pay me.

207
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:59,307
Well, no great loss, if you ask me.

208
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:03,107
I mean, why not sign up as an extra?

209
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:12,507
He's round the back somewhere.
Right, Jones, off you go.

210
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:16,347
I have to tell you if he's the man
we think he is,

211
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,147
he has a history of violence.

212
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,667
Your husband's not out looking
for him, is he?

213
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,587
My husband's gone out
for the evening.

214
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:37,187
Police! Stop!

215
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,547
SIREN BLARES

216
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,547
Gotcha!

217
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:01,347
Oi!

218
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:05,027
What's going on?
Better late than never.

219
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,787
Diane, what is going on?
A prowler.

220
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:11,547
Prowler? Where?
Standing in front of you!

221
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,987
Don't be ridiculous -
he's the security guard!

222
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,347
Since when?
A couple of days ago.

223
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,467
Oh, well, thank you for telling me.

224
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:21,587
Then why did you run away?
I didn't know who you were.

225
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,427
I shouted "police".
Anybody could do that.

226
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:28,987
Security guard for the Manor?
And for the film set.

227
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:33,147
Made sense, him keeping an eye
on things over.
So I had a word with Jack Braxton.

228
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:35,667
Who's he?
The film's producer.

229
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:45,947
Jed Norris, a security guard?

230
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:49,027
Talk about putting the fox in charge
of the hen house.

231
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,427
Our friend Ince must be involved
in this.

232
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:54,107
That producer needs to know
what he's taken on.

233
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:58,995
OK, where's your Mum.

234
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:06,755
Come on, Leonie.
OK, I'm coming.

235
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,035
Take...take that one.

236
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,515
You know Gwen's got
a job as an extra on this film,

237
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:19,315
so I'm on my own in the charity shop
today. Oh, hello!

238
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:22,275
I was watching that Nick Cheyney
on set all day yesterday. What?

239
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,835
You didn't say anything to him?

240
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:31,355
Danny, please. You promised.
Leave him to me.

241
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,795
I want Cheyney out of our lives,
Leonie. For good.

242
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:52,555
Sir...five years ago,
when Ince was on remand,

243
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:55,555
he and Norris were briefly
in Causton Jail together.

244
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:57,475
They're old acquaintances.

245
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,475
And Mr Norris has just conned
his way into a security job.

246
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,395
Pull him in for questioning, sir?

247
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:05,115
Jed's not really in the same league
as Ince, is he?

248
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:07,795
Just, er, cut him a bit of slack,
keep an eye on him.

249
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,835
George Ince is the man
we really want

250
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:13,235
and if Jed Norris can lead us to him,
well, that'd be a result.

251
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:19,875
Come on, Gwen.
You'll get the old folk fired

252
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,715
if I don't get them to the set
on time.

253
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,635
Why don't you help Joyce with the
old folk today?

254
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:28,315
I'll stay here and look after Josh.

255
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,915
No, thanks. I'm not going anywhere
near that film set.

256
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:32,795
Come on, we're out of here.

257
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,835
Let's say bye to Auntie Gwen. Bye!

258
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:37,715
Bye, Josh.

259
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,955
Bye, Leonie.
Bye. Right...

260
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:44,315
Right!

261
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,235
MAN: All right! Mind your backs!

262
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,275
Out the way, please! And you!

263
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,635
Joyce!

264
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,675
Aristos to the carriage, please.

265
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:18,355
Costume checks, please.

266
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:22,355
So, you say this guy Norris
has got form?

267
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:24,235
Just a bit.

268
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:27,875
What do you recommend?
I'd like you to keep him on.

269
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,835
At least then we'll know where he is
during the shoot.

270
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:33,795
And, between you and me,
he might prove a useful lead

271
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:36,155
to someone else
we want to keep tabs on.

272
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:39,115
Suits me. He has all the
qualifications I need. He's cheap.

273
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:41,995
What? Tight budget, this film?

274
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,155
(LAUGHS) Like a tourniquet.

275
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,395
We'd have half a chance if someone
other than that clown of a director

276
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:49,475
was calling the shots
from behind the camera.

277
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,595
But you're the producer, aren't you?

278
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:53,835
I mean, don't you appoint
the director?

279
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:56,755
I do. And ordinarily I wouldn't
touch Nick Cheyney.

280
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:59,955
But he brokered the deal that got us
this location for free.

281
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:02,635
Knows the people who own the Manor.

282
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:05,595
Ah, Mr And Mrs Charteris.
Friends of yours?

283
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:08,155
No, we don't move in
the same social circles.

284
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:12,275
Lucky you. The wife's OK,
her husband's a complete philistine.

285
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:15,395
The people we have to get into bed
with to get a movie made.

286
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,595
Figure of speech.

287
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:24,435
Mrs Barnaby looks very fetching
in that red cap, sir.

288
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,915
Peasants behind the cart, thank you!

289
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:39,555
Now, I need you to start in line
with the arch, all right?

290
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,875
Can we get some quiet, please,
and a bit of concentration?

291
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,115
All right, now, the...
Let's just have a look, love, OK?

292
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,995
The rider's gonna come galloping in
down here, all right?

293
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:50,995
Can we finish checks now, please?

294
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:53,955
Rider comes galloping in,
gives you the news from Paris.

295
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:57,475
Get out of here, no time to lose.
Barbarous hordes on their way.

296
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:01,275
Now, you're horrified but dignified.
Remember, you're French aristocrats.

297
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,195
That's all right.
Can we get the coats off, please?

298
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:08,555
Quieten down!
Can we get the coats off now!

299
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,635
Coats off, Nigel!
Going for a take.

300
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:13,675
Right. Going for a take!
All right, standing by for a take.

301
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:14,995
Turn over!
Speed!

302
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,875
Sound running!
Mark it!

303
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,795
143 take 1.

304
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:23,635
Background action!

305
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,395
And...action!

306
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,155
Go! Go! Go!

307
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:38,515
And stop!

308
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:41,115
And run back! Go!

309
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,995
CAR HORN: ODE TO JOY

00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,675
What the hell is that?!

311
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:49,275
Cut!
Cut!

312
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,435
And we've cut there, we've cut!

313
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:53,595
Reset!
Reset!

314
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:57,235
First positions, everybody.
I know that car. It can't be!

315
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:01,395
Throw him off the set.

316
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:04,075
'Scuse me, 'scuse me!
You can't park here! Ah, Nick!

317
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:07,195
Hope I didn't disturb anything.

318
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:10,555
No-one makes an entrance
quite like Raymond Clandillon.

319
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:13,635
Dying art, I'm afraid.
I try to keep it going.

320
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:17,115
Just passing? No. Thought I'd stop
for a while. Get involved.

321
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:19,835
Yeah, well I'm afraid the film's
already cast. I know.

322
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:22,635
According to this there's
not a D-list celeb

323
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:25,795
or clapped out sports star
to be found anywhere.

324
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:28,595
You've got them all.
So no room for you, then.

325
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,115
Oh, you can squeeze me in,
for old time's sake.

326
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:35,075
And what makes you think I want
a disruptive old queen like you

327
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:36,955
anywhere near my film?

328
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:41,395
I've given up the booze.
Really?

329
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:43,075
Smell my breath.
I'd rather not.

330
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:44,955
I need this.

331
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:48,635
Oh, what the hell.

332
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:53,435
We go back a long way, don't we?
Oh, thanks, Nick.

333
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:56,075
Show him where wardrobe is.
He can be the cart driver.

334
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:59,355
Reload! Reload, please! Are you
offering me work as an extra?

335
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:01,275
Take it or leave it.

336
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:05,835
OK.

337
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:09,435
And if you so much as look...
at a bottle of booze...

338
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:16,515
Can we do that again?

339
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:20,115
And this time, if it's not too much
trouble, can you get the timing
right?

340
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,675
First positions, please!

341
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:32,635
Raymond? Oh!

342
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:34,795
Is that you?

343
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:37,035
In the flesh!

344
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:40,035
Come here, you!

345
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,595
Oh! What a wonderful, wonderful
surprise.

346
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:46,355
I don't know about you,
but a Christmas card every year
hasn't been enough.

347
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:49,555
I wanted to see what you looked like
after 17 years.

348
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:52,275
Well, you haven't changed.
Gwen!

349
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:55,075
Oh, all right.
A bit frayed round the edges.

350
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:58,675
But the car's still immaculate.
Well, of course. I cherish her.

351
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,795
If there was but one room
at the Inn,

352
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:04,555
I'd gladly stay out in the cold and
let her have shelter for the night.

353
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,635
You might have to.

354
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,755
Hello, Raymond.

355
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:12,035
Neville.
The Magna Hotel's full to bursting.

356
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:14,915
I take it you are staying?
I am.

357
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:18,235
I saw that they were shooting this
film in your neck of the woods

358
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:22,075
and thought it would be the ideal
opportunity to catch up with you.

359
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:24,395
I didn't realise
we'd all be working on it.

360
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:27,075
You've got a part?
Sort of.

361
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:29,955
Must dash. Have to get changed.

362
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:36,755
Raymond. That's for the extras.

363
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:38,835
I know.

364
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,195
Hasn't that made your day?

365
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:47,675
Working as an extra? God,
that must be so humiliating for him.

366
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:50,115
And in a film directed by
Nick Cheyney.

367
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:56,955
All aristos and peasants
back on set in 15 minutes!

368
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:59,035
All right!
15 minutes, all right?

369
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:01,555
What the hell's he still doing
in your life?

370
00:24:01,555 --> 00:24:04,275
I always sign our Christmas cards
from both of us.

371
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,235
You knew he was still living
with me.

372
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,995
But why? You don't owe him anything.

373
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,915
Ted's dead.
You're under no obligation

374
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:14,675
to look after his brother.
I know that.

375
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:18,475
So why would you want
your brother-in-law
lurking about the place?

376
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:21,115
Particularly when you're...
well, you know.

377
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:24,435
What?
Trying to entertain.

378
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:27,515
Do you mean sex?

379
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:29,195
Yes.

380
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:32,875
It must be hard enough to come by
in a dead and alive hole like this.

381
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,275
Oh, I've lost interest in all that.
You?

382
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,115
I don't believe it!

383
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:40,115
You go without something long
enough, you get used to it.

384
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,675
Then we'll have to get you
unused to it.

385
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:46,315
Oh, yeah? And what are you going to
do about it, you old poof?

386
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:48,995
Oooh! That's my Gwen!

387
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,715
CHATTER

388
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,635
You look as though you need that.

389
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:15,435
Well, I know how Sisyphus felt.

390
00:25:15,435 --> 00:25:17,275
Is that a medical complaint?

391
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:19,315
Character in Greek mythology.

392
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,355
Had to push a boulder up a hill.

393
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:24,195
Couldn't relax or it would roll back
and crush him.

394
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:27,555
I'll keep 'em coming, then.
Nah, I've gotta go to the Manor.

395
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:30,635
Dinner with the producer.
Oh. You likely to be late?

396
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,555
I hope not. Why?

397
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:35,235
Well, I'll wait up.
We can sink a few then.

398
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:37,715
Good man. Well, I'll drink to that.

399
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:41,915
Oh, I was er...just saying.

400
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,875
Drink later on, when you get back
from dinner?

401
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,195
Oh, I thought you meant
just the two of us.

402
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:49,755
Oh, I...
Very nice of you to include me.

403
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:54,195
Don't worry Nick, I've got other
plans. I'm sure you have.

404
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:11,835
Can I help you, sir?
You certainly can.

405
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:16,795
I have spent the last 30 years
coming out of the closet,

406
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:19,275
and you have put me back into one.

407
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,475
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

408
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:23,795
I want a bigger room.

409
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:27,395
Taxi for Mr Cheyney. Through there,
to the left, peasants' bar.

410
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,835
I'll check on the computer.

411
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:37,075
All right?

412
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:47,915
Have you ridden with this guy
before? No. Why?

413
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,915
From the look he was giving you,

414
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,835
I assumed you'd forgotten
to tip him.

415
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:59,955
Oh, no, my darling. Leave it,
please. Well, it's me or Danny.

416
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:02,115
Well, does it have to be
either of you, just now?

417
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:03,995
He's got to be confronted.

418
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:11,955
So, I was thinking as an added
attraction for the great unwashed

419
00:27:11,955 --> 00:27:14,835
we might open the place
to the public while you're filming.

420
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,595
I can't have the public around
while I'm trying to work.

421
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:21,475
Then get your arse into gear. You're
a jobbing director, not Fellini.

422
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,155
We can't afford to finance
your fantasies.

423
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:30,915
Leonie.
Ah, your gorgeous daughter!

424
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:36,075
Leonie, please.
This is a business meeting.

425
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:38,395
It's neither the time nor the place.

426
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,555
It's always about what you want,
isn't it?

427
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,755
Must never jeopardise the deal.

428
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:45,275
Diane, see our daughter out,
will you?

429
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:49,275
I'm sorry? You seem to have mistaken
me for one of the hired help.

430
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:51,435
Besides, I don't think she's ready
to go yet.

431
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:53,315
Oh, I am!

432
00:27:56,955 --> 00:28:01,435
Don't you even think about
coming anywhere near me or my child.

433
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:03,315
MY child.

434
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:08,315
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Am I being threatened?

435
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:12,835
Yes. You are.

436
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:32,675
I seem to have lost my appetite.
Yeah, well, I'll come with you.

437
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:34,555
You're the reason I'm leaving.

438
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:39,275
Sorry, Nick. Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

439
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:56,755
Hands off my grandson, Nick,
or I'll see you dead.

440
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,075
VEHICLE APPROACHES

441
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:17,035
ENGINE STOPS AND DOORS OPEN

442
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,755
DISTANT RAISED VOICES

443
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,555
I promised Leonie
I'd stay out of this,

444
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,795
but if you go anywhere near her
or Josh...

445
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:40,435
Good God! Even the taxi driver's
threatening me now.

446
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,315
Is the whole bloody village
in on this?

447
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:44,195
No. Just me.

448
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:48,755
And just what has it got to do
with you?

449
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,195
I'm Leonie's partner.
Partner?!

450
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:54,955
(LAUGHS) How PC!

451
00:29:54,955 --> 00:29:57,475
Well, partner or not,

452
00:29:57,475 --> 00:30:00,755
you have no rights
where Josh is concerned, but I have.

453
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:04,755
So if I choose to get closer
to my son...

454
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:08,355
..there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

455
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:10,235
Oh, there is!

456
00:30:11,595 --> 00:30:13,475
VAN DOOR SLAMS AND ENGINE STARTS

457
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:20,235
(CRIES OUT)

458
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:49,415
Hi, George.

459
00:31:49,415 --> 00:31:51,415
What have you got here?

460
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:54,935
Dead five or six hours. Cause of
death, head separated from the body.

461
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:57,695
Now, that's where we benefit from
having an expert on the job.

462
00:31:57,695 --> 00:31:59,775
That's enough from you.

463
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:01,655
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

464
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:06,055
It's Nick Cheyney.
The film's director.

465
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:07,975
You know him?

466
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:12,015
I saw him yesterday.
When he was in one piece.

467
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:16,415
Well, we don't have to look far
for the murder weapon.

468
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:18,695
If it was murder.
Really?

469
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,895
There's no sign of a struggle

470
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:24,975
and only Mr Cheyney and Mr Braxton
held keys to the safety lock.

471
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:28,335
You think it could be suicide?
Except there's no sign of his key.

472
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:34,655
Who found him?
The security guard.

473
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:36,535
Jed Norris.

474
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:43,535
I spoke to him. Mr Cheyney.
He came looking for me.

475
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:46,735
What for?
Wanted me to get lost for an hour.

476
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:49,655
I have to say, I didn't expect
to see him again last night.

477
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,335
Again?
Yeah.

478
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:53,775
He'd been to dinner at the Manor.
Big bust up.

479
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:55,815
I could hear them arguing
from outside

480
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:58,695
and the looks they were giving him
when he left. Who?

481
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:00,855
Mr and Mrs Charteris,
their daughter,

482
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,935
Mr Braxton... Even the cab driver.

483
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:07,655
Was he alone on the set
when you saw him? Oh, yeah.

484
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:10,415
That's what made it all
a bit creepy. In what way?

485
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:12,415
He was so drunk
he was barely conscious.

486
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:15,975
So someone drove him there.
I never heard him arrive.

487
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:18,655
I mean, car, dead of night.
You'd hear it.

488
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,055
But I didn't.

489
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:24,175
Here, listen,
could I have a strong coffee?

490
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:26,295
This place is giving me the creeps.

491
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,455
Turning sensitive in your old age,
Jed?

492
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:31,575
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right,
don't worry about me.

493
00:33:31,575 --> 00:33:34,295
I'm only the one who found
the head in the basket.

494
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:36,215
Did you find it?
You know I did.

495
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,775
Or did you put it there?
No, no, no, no, no, no!

496
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:40,815
I'm not having that.

497
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:43,815
I mean, I might have a bit of form
but I'm not a violent man.

498
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,815
Check my record.
We know your record, Jed.

499
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:49,375
What about George Ince?

500
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,775
Ince was nowhere near this place
last night.

501
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:54,375
Far as I know.

502
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,255
All right, Jed,
go get yourself that coffee. Thanks.

503
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,735
What about Ince? He's a violent man.

504
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:13,255
Yeah, but he's a robber
first and foremost.

505
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:15,815
And if Cheyney had disturbed him
during a break-in,

506
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:18,135
he would have attacked him
without a thought.

507
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:20,415
But he wouldn't have had to chop
his head off.

508
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:24,815
You know, Jones,
under the circumstances,

509
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:27,615
this is not an ideal interview room.

510
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:38,855
Who was at the dinner party
last night?

511
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:41,295
It was a working dinner.
Just the three of us.

512
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:43,815
The three of you?
Me, Nick and Jack Braxton.

513
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,255
Mrs Charteris, you weren't there?

514
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,735
No, no. It was a business meeting.

515
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:51,975
Although she did make an entrance
with our charming daughter.

516
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:54,895
Leonie turned up unexpectedly.
She left early.

517
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,815
After doing her best
to ruin the evening.

518
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:59,015
Why would she want to do that?

519
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:02,495
Because she's my daughter. Do you
have children, Chief Inspector?

520
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:04,255
How can you even ask that?

521
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:07,575
Do you know, you and Nick Cheyney
are two of a kind.

522
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:10,215
What's that supposed to mean?
You're both...

523
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:12,615
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
..lousy fathers!

524
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:15,215
Jones?
Oh, steady on, Sergeant.

525
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:20,575
That's a high-quality piece of
furniture you're knocking about
there. Priceless, in fact.

526
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,455
Sorry. It was a wrong number.

527
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:27,455
I understand you're planning to open
the Manor as a heritage site, sir?

528
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:31,135
That's right. Turns out the old
place is groaning with history.

529
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:34,255
Priceless, eh? Yeah, well,
not literally, but pretty close.

530
00:35:34,255 --> 00:35:36,855
Certainly irreplaceable.
Mr Charteris...

531
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:39,015
did Braxton and Cheyney leave
together?

532
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:42,855
No, they left separately. They don't
have much time for one another.

533
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:45,055
And what state was Mr Cheyney in
when he left?

534
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:50,215
Well, he'd had a drink.
What does that mean, precisely?

535
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,975
It means he was drunk.
And objectionably so.

536
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:55,695
That's Nick.
As though that makes it acceptable.

537
00:35:56,815 --> 00:36:01,695
Look...I suppose there's no way of
stopping this, Chief Inspector?

538
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:04,135
I'm sorry?
All the negative publicity.

539
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:07,535
Oh, that is not my department,
I'm afraid.

540
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:11,255
Mrs Charteris, what did you do
after Mr Cheyney left?

541
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:15,055
I had an early night.
(SNORTS)

542
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:28,775
Jones, what was all that
about the furniture?

543
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:31,175
We are investigating
a suspicious death

544
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:33,815
and you're going on about
a flaming cupboard.

545
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,815
Because it was a fake.
How do you know?

546
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,815
My grandad was a cabinet maker.

547
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:40,215
He was a what?
He was a master cabinet maker.

548
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:42,335
So he'd know all about
dodgy cupboards?

549
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:45,535
All I'm saying is that cupboard
was far from irreplaceable.

550
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,135
Ironic, isn't it?

551
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:55,135
An every-expense-spared production
and the cheap old prop

552
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:58,255
we had made up to look like
a guillotine actually works.

553
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:01,255
But you want to know if you can
carry on filming, yeah?

554
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:04,175
I was thinking more along the lines
of when.

555
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,895
How're you gonna find a new director
at such short notice?

556
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:09,015
On our budget, we won't!

557
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:11,215
Although Cheyney wasn't being paid,

558
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:14,255
his indulgent style of shooting
was costing us a fortune.

559
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:17,055
Not being paid? He was on
a profit-sharing agreement.

560
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:20,975
That's how desperate we both were.
No, I will take over as director.

561
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:23,335
Will you? You seem very pleased
at the prospect.

562
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:27,375
Mr Braxton, is there someone
who can confirm where you were

563
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,615
at the time of Nick Cheyney's death,
like Mrs Charteris?

564
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,735
What are you implying?
Mrs Charteris - she called us out

565
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:36,255
a couple of nights ago
to investigate a prowler.

566
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,855
She said she was just about
to go to bed. So?

567
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:42,455
Well, her husband was out.
Your car was at the front door.

568
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:46,375
OK.

569
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,655
Diane Charteris and I
spent last night together too.

570
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:53,255
So you are each other's alibis
for the time of Nick Cheyney's death?

571
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:56,495
Mm.
Thank you.

572
00:37:56,495 --> 00:38:00,055
You can carry on filming.
But only because I want to keep
everyone together

573
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:03,095
for the sake of this investigation.
Thank you, Mr Braxton.

00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,775
Freddie.

576
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:18,655
Morning, sir.

577
00:38:18,655 --> 00:38:21,335
Nick Cheyney.
He was staying here, wasn't he?

578
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:25,215
That's right. I heard him come back
last night. Only he didn't.

579
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:28,975
I'm sorry, you've lost me.

580
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,335
He'd been for dinner at the Manor.

581
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:34,655
We'd arranged to have a drink
when he got back.

582
00:38:34,655 --> 00:38:37,095
Well, I heard Danny's taxi pull up
outside.

583
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,055
Danny? Who's Danny?
Danny Twyman.

584
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:41,215
He's a nice lad.
Runs a local minibus.

585
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:43,535
And you recognised his voice.
Yeah.

586
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,975
They were having an argument.
About what?

587
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:48,855
I couldn't hear.
Didn't last long, though.

588
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:52,535
Danny drove off and I was expecting
Cheyney to come into the hotel.

589
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,095
He didn't.

590
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:58,775
What do you think happened to him?
We know what happened.

591
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:00,735
We're trying to work out why.

592

(WOMAN SNIFFS AND SOBS)

593
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:09,855
We knew him
when he first started out.

594
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,135
He was a louse even then.

595
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:17,015
What a waste of life.

596
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:19,535
What a wicked waste of life.

597
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:22,535

drop him off last night?

600
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:49,415
Outside the Midsomer Magna Hotel.

601
00:39:49,415 --> 00:39:52,655
We have a witness
who heard raised voices.

602
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:55,455
We had a row over the fare.

603
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:58,055
Asked if I took credit cards. As if!

604
00:39:58,055 --> 00:40:00,335
So you didn't drive him
to the film set?

605
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:02,695
No way. He'd already had one ride
for free.

606
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:06,895
See anyone else while you were
driving around the Manor?

607
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:08,695
Only Jed Norris hanging around.

608
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:12,255
How long have you known
Miss Charteris?

609
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:15,935
We were students together,
on a drama course in London.

610
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,135
Before she was pregnant?

611
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:20,935
I'm not Josh's dad,
if that's what you're asking.

612
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:26,455
I'd like to be. That's why I
followed her back to Midsomer Magna.

613
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:29,135
To help her make the break.
The break from what?

614
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,735
Her dad. Lets her live here
rent-free but he's a control freak.

615
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:37,375
Is that what she argued with him
about last night?

616
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:40,375
Or had she gone there to confront
Nick Cheyney?

617
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:43,975
Well, she didn't like the man.
Well, neither does her mother.

618
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:49,175
Is that because Nick Cheyney
is the father of Leonie's child?

619
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,735
Yes. Yes, he was.

620
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,655
So they were in a relationship?

621
00:40:57,615 --> 00:41:00,335
He came to our college
as a visiting lecturer.

622
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:03,095
The only relationship they had
was the sort that happens

623
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:05,415
after a 50p-a-pint night
in the student bar.

624
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:12,375
You come and give your Auntie Gwen
a big cuddle.

625
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,815
Gwen, you ought to go home.
I can manage here.

626
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:17,295
Are you sure?
Cos I really do feel dreadful.

627
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:19,455
It's fine. Really.

628
00:41:19,455 --> 00:41:21,055
Good morning.
Tom.

629
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:23,255
Gwen.

630
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:25,215
Miss Charteris.
You've come to see me?

631
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:28,415
Yes, yes, we have.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby

632
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:31,215
and this is Detective Sergeant Jones
from Causton CID.

633
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:35,455
Miss Charteris, I understand that
you were at a dinner

634
00:41:35,455 --> 00:41:38,855
with Mr Nick Cheyney last night
and you had an argument.

635
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:41,575
A blazing row would be
more accurate.

636
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:44,135
Look, Danny's phoned me.
Has he?

637
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,175
Then he will have told you
that we know

638
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:48,615
that Nick Cheyney was Josh's father?

639
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,815
What? Oh, God!

640
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:53,535
Are you OK?
No, I'm all right. Please.

641
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:55,935
No. I'm fine, I'm fine.

642
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:58,455
Gwen was just about to go home,
actually.

643
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,855
Nick's death has really upset her.

644
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,175
Err, Miss Charteris, can we, er...

645
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:08,015
Erm, yes, of course.

646
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:12,095
How did your parents react
when you became pregnant?

647
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,855
Oh, my dad had a top man lined up
in Harley Street.

648
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:20,735
Which you obviously resisted.
You bet.

649
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,975
And where was Mr Cheyney
in all of this?

650
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,975
Making the arrangements.
How did you know?

651
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:28,255
That's the sort of thing
Nick would've done.

652
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:31,135
Of course, you knew him, didn't you?

653
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:35,255
So your parents were aware
that Cheyney was Josh's father?

654
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,455
Oh, yeah.

655
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:40,535
What bugs me is how easily
Dad dismisses what Nick did to me.

656
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:46,295
It may not have been rape but...
he took advantage.

657
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:51,255
And did he acknowledge that
he was the father of your child?

658
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:53,975
Barely, and that suited me fine.

659
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:58,695
Until he arrived here and started
talking about getting to know Josh.

660
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:00,815
He could've been winding me up.

661
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,535
But I wasn't taking any chances.

662
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:07,615
By luring him to the guillotine
and chopping his head off?

663
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:11,415
Do I look like a murderer?

664
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:25,375
Yes and er...Lady Arabella,
her name was.

665
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,575
Fine looking woman.
Beautiful.

666
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:31,375
Yes, distinct likeness,
if I may say so.

667
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,215
Mind out, sir.
I know, you were asking about...

668
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:37,455
This apparently is the only chalk
farm - Mr Charteris.

669
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:39,535
Oh. I've got a couple of questions
for you.

670
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:50,335
Why didn't you tell us about
the argument you had

671
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:52,615
at your dinner party
the other evening?

672
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:54,975
It was just Leonie
being bloody with Nick.

673
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:58,735
The father of her son.
Oh, you know about that now, do you?

674
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:01,135
Single mother against the world.

675
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:03,775
Hardly a single mother -
she's in a relationship.

676
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:07,375
Oh, is that what you call it?
You don't approve of Danny Twyman?

677
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:11,015
Are you serious? Went against the
grain hiring him for the evening,

678
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,135
but he's the only taxi in the area.

679
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:14,895
You hired him?

680
00:44:14,895 --> 00:44:18,415
Yeah, paid him on account to pick
Nick up and drop him back off again.

681
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:25,575
You must have had a very complicated
relationship with Nick Cheyney.

682
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:28,375
I've known Nick for years,
Chief Inspector.

683
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,415
And you knew about his affair
with your daughter?

684
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:34,215
Yes.

685
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:37,615
And you still felt able to entertain
him to dinner under your roof?

686
00:44:37,615 --> 00:44:39,535
That was purely business.

687
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,895
And you weren't in favour of
Nick Cheyney

688
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:45,015
being involved in
your grandson's life?

689
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:48,335
I'd have made sure it didn't happen.

690
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:50,455
How would you have done that?

691
00:44:52,135 --> 00:44:54,215
Not by killing him, Chief Inspector.

692
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:56,975
But I would have stopped him.

693
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:05,855
How long had you known Nick Cheyney?

694
00:45:07,415 --> 00:45:09,615
We worked on some films together.

695
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:11,855
Yeah, we looked him up
on the database.

696
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:14,055
Apparently he made
a few box office hits.

697
00:45:14,055 --> 00:45:17,895
Oh, he'd known what it was like
to work with big names, big budgets.

698
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:19,975
I suppose you can understand him

699
00:45:19,975 --> 00:45:22,175
becoming a bit resentful
in later life.

700
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:25,055
Gwen, stop defending the man.
Nobody ever liked him.

701
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,935
That's not true.

702
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,655
We worked with lots of other
directors besides Nick.

703
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:33,055
In the business we were known as
the Four Musketeers.

704
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,295
Me, Neville, Raymond and Ted.

705
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:37,695
Ted?
My late husband.

706
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:39,855
Neville's brother.

707
00:45:39,855 --> 00:45:42,895
He died just before we moved
to Midsomer Magna.

708
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:48,055
No children? Does that question have
any relevance?

709
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:50,335
Well, I won't know
until you answer it, Gwen.

710
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:55,095
No. No children.

711
00:45:56,695 --> 00:46:00,295
Background artists for scene 53,
back on set now, please!

712
00:46:02,655 --> 00:46:04,575
Gwen?

713
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:07,855
Er, yes, off you go, thank you.

714
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:18,455
Touched a nerve there.
I thought I might.

715
00:46:22,775 --> 00:46:25,615
Last time I saw Nick,
as he was leaving for dinner.

716
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:29,335
I was in reception trying to get
moved from my shoebox of a room.

717
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:32,935
And where were you after that?
In bed. Exhausted and defeated.

718
00:46:32,935 --> 00:46:34,855
You didn't like Nick Cheyney,
did you?

719
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:37,975
No, and I did briefly entertain
the notion of trying to kill him

720
00:46:37,975 --> 00:46:41,375
to get a bigger room, but I thought
that was a touch excessive.

721
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:45,375
Did you have any other reason
for wanting him dead?

722
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:48,695
Believe me, having to spend
the night in that single bed
was reason enough.

723
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:56,695
Thank you. Keep the change.

724
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:03,295
Psst! Psst!

725
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,095
Chief Inspector.
Yes?

726
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:08,215
I've been waiting to speak to you.

727
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:11,775
Why didn't you come through
to the bar? I could hardly do that.

728
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:14,575
It was Raymond Clandillon
I wanted to tell you about.

729
00:47:14,575 --> 00:47:18,895
You do know they hated one another,
him and Nick Cheyney?

730
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:20,975
Well, he didn't put it
as strongly as that.

731
00:47:20,975 --> 00:47:23,375
And I bet he didn't tell you why.

732
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,575
Nick Cheyney sacked him from a film
they were working on.

733
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:31,295
So he had a reason.
But Cheyney didn't leave it at that.

734
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:34,295
Bad-mouthed him
all around the industry.

735
00:47:34,295 --> 00:47:36,895
Tipped Raymond's career
into free-fall.

736
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,015
Did he?
Well, thank you, thank you for that.

737
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:42,815
Just thought you'd like to know.
Yes, thank you.

738
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:49,359
Right, going for a take!

739
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,559
Going for a take!
Standing by for a take!

740
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:53,719
Turn over!
Speed!

741
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:55,679
Sound rolling!
Mark it!

742
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,479
168, take 7.
Stand by...

743
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:01,159
and...action!

744
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,159
HALF-HEARTED CHEERING

745
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:19,439
Cut!
Cut!

746
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,079
I would like to try and clarify
something.

747
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,519
You are downtrodden peasants.

748
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:32,679
And these people... See?

749
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:35,679
These people have ground you
into the earth.

750
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,799
They've exploited you
all your lives.

751
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:39,759
You hate them with a passion.

752
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:42,479
And now it is payback time.

753
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:46,639
So when you hear the blade
slice through their necks,

754
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:51,439
I want you to try and imagine
your feelings of joyful revenge,

755
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:54,039
and let me hear it!

756
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:56,279
Right?
MURMURING

757
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:03,639
OK, reset, everybody!

758
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:07,599
Ronnie, how long with the blood?
Ten minutes.

759
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,439
Make it five!

760
00:49:09,879 --> 00:49:13,799
Raymond Clandillon
was no fan of Nick Cheyney.

761
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:15,999
Neither was Neville Hayward.

762
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:20,079
And Jack Braxton's almost joyful
at getting rid of him from the film.

763
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,519
Diane Charteris loathed him.

764
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,719
Not sure about the husband, though.

765
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:26,599
Hurry up with that blood!

766
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:33,559
Gwen, you shouldn't be doing this.
You're still in shock.

767
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:35,479
Take it up!

768
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:37,319
I've always been a professional,
Joyce.

769
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:41,959
I hope I still am.

770
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:44,199
Then, of course,
there's Danny Twyman.

771
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:46,279
He admits having a row
with Nick Cheyney,

772
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:48,239
but he lied about the reason,
didn't he?

773
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,159
It couldn't have been over the fare

774
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,239
because that had already been paid
for by Terence Charteris.

775
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,519
So why should we believe that he
didn't take Cheyney to the film set?

776
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,679
Hello. What's going on over there?

777
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,879
Someone find me the unit nurse,
please.

778
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:08,079
(SNIFFS) It's not booze.

779
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,239
Neville!

780
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,039
It's worth checking,
given his track record.

781
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,439
Raymond?
What's going on?

782
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:20,039
How are you feeling?
I'm fine now.

783
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:21,759
Are you sure?
Yeah.

784
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,879
High blood pressure.

785
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,079
Happens from time to time.

786
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,039
Tell me. Why are you prepared
to work as an extra?

787
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:35,079
Got to do something
to pay the bills.

788
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:37,079
No, I mean on this particular film.

789
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,719
With a director who did his best
to ruin your career?

790
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:43,159
Cheyney only helped me on my way.

791
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,799
I was already well down that slope.

792
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:48,519
So you didn't bear him a grudge?
Of course I did.

793
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,439
That's exactly why I wanted to get
on this film.

794
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:54,599
You came to kill him.
I came to gloat.

795
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:56,559
Sorry, I'm not following that.

796
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,399
Look, I may be just an extra
in a rubbish movie,

797
00:50:59,399 --> 00:51:01,839
but Nick was actually directing it.

798
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,599
And for him that was a living death.

799
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,279
Mr Braxton? I'm sorry.

800
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:27,719
Her head won't be underneath the
blade when it falls, will it?

801
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,599
No. Let me show you.

802
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,519
Can you demonstrate
the blade safety?

803
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:39,399
Satisfied?
Ah, yes.

804
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:42,239
But that guillotine remains under
guard at all times

805
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:44,959
and you retain the key, OK?
Fine.

806
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,319
Is it absolutely necessary for him
to be here while we're filming?

807
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,359
Well, I can have him removed,

808
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,039
but we'll have to shut down your
film set. If he goes, everybody goes.

809
00:51:57,479 --> 00:51:59,799
Right, let's do this!

810
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:02,359
Quiet, please! Going for a take!

811
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:03,999
Quiet, please!
Stand by!

812
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:05,799
Turnover!
Running!

813
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,719
End board!

814
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,679
Stand by!

815
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,519
And action!

816
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,159
Takes some guts to put your head
where Cheyney lost his.

817
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:29,039
There's more to Gwen Morrison
than meets the eye.

818
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:31,479
Let's hope it stays that way.
Quiet, everyone!

819
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:35,919
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

820
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:40,799
Cut!
Cut!

821
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:42,679
MOBILE CONTINUES RINGING

822
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,839
Whose mobile is that?

823
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:57,319
TURNS MOBILE OFF
Sorry!

824
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,759
Beautiful.

825
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:11,559
Feeling better?
Much.

826
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:13,959
But you look as though
you could do with cheering up.

827
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:15,839
I'm all right. I've got Josh.

828
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,719
Cute little fellow but he belongs
with his mum.

829
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,879
He's the last thing you need
right now, and you know it.

830
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:26,559
So what do you suggest?
A spin in my beast.

831
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,279
It'll put the glow back
in your cheeks again.

832
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:32,199
But I can't, I've got to wait for
the old people.

833
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:35,439
They can manage without you.
Now, come on, come on.

834
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:38,239
We'll go for a trip down
memory lane. Oh, stop it!

835
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:41,959
That argument you had
with Nick Cheyney,

836
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,999
It was nothing to do with
that taxi fare.

837
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:45,719
You were angrier than that.
Was I?

838
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:48,679
Yes. Nick Cheyney was trying to get
involved in Josh's life.

839
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,639
You couldn't let that happen.

840
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:52,559
I don't know why you were worried.

841
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,359
Leonie wasn't about to push you out
in favour of Nick Cheyney.

842
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,399
Although, successful film director,
cab driver... Given the choice...

843
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:02,639
Yes, and after all,
Nick Cheyney was the real father.

844
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,519
The best thing Nick ever did for
Josh was stay away from him.

845
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:07,479
Real father?

846
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:11,359
I'm the only father Josh
has ever known and that's the way
it's going to stay!

847
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,679
That's Ince!

848
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,359
With Charteris.

849
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:31,999
Yeah. I doubt they're talking
rare antiques.

850
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,719
Remember this? You and Ted
in the back, me at the wheel,

851
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,079
and Neville chewing his nails
down to his elbows.

852
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,799
You did drive a bit recklessly.
With gay abandon!

853
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:45,679
Reckless abandon.

854
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,559
Happy days!

855
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,519
Then why the tears?

856
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:56,199
You know why.

857
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,679
Gwen, it's over.

858
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:03,879
A long time ago.

859
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:16,439
We've found traces of Oramorph
in Cheyney's body.

860
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,519
What's Oramorph?
Morphine based, colourless.

861
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:22,239
It's a controlled drug,
issued on prescription.

862
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,359
Usually to terminal cancer patients
to ease their pain.

863
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,999
Any sign of cancer in Cheyney?
None at all.

864
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,759
So what is the significance of this?

865
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:34,079
Combined with alcohol, and there was
plenty of that in his system,

866
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,439
Oramorph would have caused Cheyney
to pass out.

867
00:55:36,439 --> 00:55:39,519
So the likelihood is that Cheyney
was unconscious

868
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,359
before the blade fell.
I'd have thought so.

869
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:45,479
Which tells us -
That someone else was involved

870
00:55:45,479 --> 00:55:48,079
and that this is now
a murder investigation.

871
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:56,279
Now what?

872
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:59,639
Sit yourself down, Jed.

873
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,399
I want you to know why you're
employed here as a security guard.

874
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:09,359
It's obvious. This place is
stacked out with valuable stuff.

875
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,239
Some of the pictures alone
are worth millions.

876
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:14,639
Who told you that?
Charteris or Ince?

877
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,559
I don't know what you mean.

878
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,159
They're in it together, Jed,
and you are being taken for a mug.

879
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,679
There's nothing in this place
worth more than a few quid.

880
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,159
It's all fake.
It's an insurance scam, Jed.

881
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,319
Once your friend Ince has cleared
this place out,

882
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:35,199
who d'you think I'll be looking for
as the inside man who let him in, eh?

883
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,559
With your record,
it'll be open and shut.

884
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:40,159
Charteris and Ince
know that you are no grass.

885
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:42,759
They're relying on it.
It'll be a long sentence too.

886
00:56:42,759 --> 00:56:46,679
Yes, indeed it will. Especially
if he's involved with a murderer.

887
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:48,559
Murderer?

888
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,159
Oh, I needed that.
Oh, you've earned those, gentlemen.

889
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:00,039
LAUGHTER

890
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,359
Careful, careful, careful.
Here comes the constabulary.

891
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,359
Being a bit loud, were we?

892
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:10,759
No, of course you weren't.
May we join you?

893
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:12,479
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

894
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,319
You're looking in better spirits.

895
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,199
We were remembering one of Nick's
films that we worked on.

896
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:24,399
That's me, Neville, Raymond
and er...that's Ted.

897
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,319
Oh, thank you.
Oh, the Four Musketeers.

898
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,319
That was a long time ago.

899
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:32,039
I can tell that by the togas
you're all wearing.

900
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:35,439
That was on the set of The Cross And
The Sword. A Biblical epic.

901
00:57:35,439 --> 00:57:39,119
They were slaves.
I was an army commander.
I was actually on a horse.

902
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,519
Raymond was an actor back then.

903
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:44,039
Proper parts.
I was, yes.

904
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:46,559
You can look me up in Who's This?
of show business.

905
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,039
Well, you're an extra
with the rest of us now.

906
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:54,039
And it's the drink which has
brought me this far down
the evolutionary scale, Your Honour.

907
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:57,679
Shame it wasn't a solo trip.
Neville!

908
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,079
But no, you had to drag Ted along
for the ride.

909
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,559
Neville, that's not what happened.
Oh, for pity's sake, Gwen.

910
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:08,399
Your husband, my brother,
drank himself to death

911
00:58:08,399 --> 00:58:11,039
and he was always there
to buy the next round.

912
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:14,919
I'm going home.

913
00:58:14,919 --> 00:58:16,839
Sorry.

914
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:20,639
'Scuse me!
Hey!

915
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:22,559
Thank you!

916
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:28,039
Thank you.
Er, that's mine.

917
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:30,679
Oh, I thought you were gonna let me
keep it.

918
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:32,599
Sorry, darling.
Aw!

919
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:34,479
It's the only one I have of Ted.

920
00:59:06,837 --> 00:59:10,757
"You wish once more to see me
a love-sick supplicant at your feet,

921
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:13,437
so that you can have the pleasure
of kicking me aside

922
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:15,637
like a troublesome lapdog?"

923
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,917
It's not working.
It's only a run-through.

924
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:21,597
He's doing his best.
He's too wooden.

925
00:59:21,597 --> 00:59:24,357
He is supposed to be wooden.

926
00:59:24,357 --> 00:59:28,157
He's a stiff-arsed aristocrat
who can't express his true feelings.

927
00:59:28,157 --> 00:59:30,357
My husband!

928
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:33,557
A man who loves me with a passion
underneath all that.

929
00:59:33,557 --> 00:59:35,677
But he can't bring himself
to tell you.

930
00:59:35,677 --> 00:59:37,637
That is the whole point
of the scene.

931
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:39,517
(EXASPERATED GROAN)

932
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:50,477
Let's take a break.
Reload!

933
00:59:55,117 --> 00:59:57,037
DIALS NUMBER ON MOBILE PHONE

934
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:03,357
Neville Hayward resents the time

935
01:00:03,357 --> 01:00:06,637
Clandillon spent drinking with
his brother Ted, doesn't he?

936
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:09,317
Yeah, but Gwen didn't seem bothered
by it, did she?

937
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:11,757
And Ted was Gwen's husband.

938
01:00:11,757 --> 01:00:14,997
So maybe Neville was jealous?
Maybe he fancied Clandillon.

939
01:00:14,997 --> 01:00:17,117
Unrequited love and all that.

940
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:19,757
Do you think Neville's gay?

941
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:24,077
Well, he's never married.
He's lived with his sister-in-law
most of his adult life.

942
01:00:24,077 --> 01:00:26,037
I'm not so sure about that.

943
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:31,477
Problem, Mr Braxton?
Oh, just the usual.

944
01:00:32,437 --> 01:00:35,237
Why don't you get someone else
to read the scene with her?

945
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:37,637
Any suggestions?

946
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:39,517
Yeah, Neville Hayward.

947
01:00:39,517 --> 01:00:42,517
Who? Neville Hayward.
There, talking to her now.

948
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:46,477
An extra? He'll be no better.

949
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:49,197
She doesn't want someone
who's better, Mr Braxton.

950
01:00:49,197 --> 01:00:52,677
She wants some acknowledgement
of the tantrum she's just thrown.

951
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:57,197
You're right.

952
01:00:57,197 --> 01:00:59,317
Might be worth a try.

953
01:00:59,317 --> 01:01:01,357
And you'd be doing me a favour,
thank you.

954
01:01:02,997 --> 01:01:04,877
Stand by! Stand by!

955
01:01:24,517 --> 01:01:28,397
Right, we're getting there. Let's go
once more from the top of the scene.

956
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:31,877
And...action!

957
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:35,517
You required my presence, madam?

958
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:38,437
I assume that it was not
with a view to...

959
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:40,917
indulging in tender reminiscences.

960
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:43,077
Why not?

961
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:45,997
The present is not so glorious
but that I should wish

962
01:01:45,997 --> 01:01:48,117
to dwell a little in the past.

963
01:01:49,157 --> 01:01:51,597
Is it possible that love can die?

964
01:01:51,597 --> 01:01:53,237
Good, good.

965
01:01:53,237 --> 01:01:55,397
But you're ferociously proud,

966
01:01:55,397 --> 01:01:59,037
and you're determined to get him to
express his true feelings for you.

967
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:03,197
I thought the passion you felt
for me

968
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:05,517
would outlast the span
of human life.

969
01:02:10,837 --> 01:02:14,917
You wish once more to see me
a love-sick supplicant at your feet,

970
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:17,917
so that you may have the pleasure
of kicking me aside

971
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:19,837
like a troublesome lapdog?

972
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,877
I entreat you...

973
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:24,597
can we not bury the past?

974
01:02:26,357 --> 01:02:29,797
But I understood you to say that it
was your desire to dwell in it.

975
01:02:29,797 --> 01:02:31,677
And tears, tears.

976
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:37,157
Since it distresses you...

977
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:39,117
we will speak no more of it.

978
01:02:41,037 --> 01:02:43,837
Unable to express his feelings
he turns and leaves.

979
01:02:44,757 --> 01:02:48,157
And that is where we're gonna cut.
That's absolutely wonderful!

980
01:02:48,157 --> 01:02:49,797
Are you happy?

981
01:02:49,797 --> 01:02:51,797
Right, well, all we need now

982
01:02:51,797 --> 01:02:54,997
is for Sir Percy to grace us
with his presence and we're away.

983
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:56,917
Jack, have you got a minute?

984
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:03,797
Neville.

985
01:03:03,797 --> 01:03:06,717
That was very good, that. Very good.

986
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:09,237
And very revealing.

987
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,237
What do you mean?

988
01:03:12,237 --> 01:03:14,477
Gwen Morrison's interest
in children?

989
01:03:14,477 --> 01:03:16,597
Why did she never have any children
of her own?

990
01:03:18,237 --> 01:03:20,437
It's a touchy subject.

991
01:03:20,437 --> 01:03:22,677
They were desperate
to have a family.

992
01:03:22,677 --> 01:03:24,837
Her and my brother, Ted.

993
01:03:24,837 --> 01:03:26,597
But they never did.

994
01:03:28,117 --> 01:03:30,237
Oh, well, they tried.

995
01:03:30,237 --> 01:03:32,517
Three miscarriages, Gwen suffered.

996
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,557
And what effect
did that have on Ted?

997
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:36,557
He was devastated.

998
01:03:36,557 --> 01:03:39,717
Turned to drink. Slow suicide.

999
01:03:39,717 --> 01:03:42,277
With Raymond Clandillon for company.

1000
01:03:46,037 --> 01:03:49,637
When Ted died,
I did what I could for Gwen...

1001
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,277
..but I can never forgive Raymond.

1002
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:55,197
That was good of you though,
wasn't it,

1003
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,797
you know, to stay around
and pick up the pieces?

1004
01:03:59,197 --> 01:04:01,117
I did it for my brother.

1005
01:04:02,157 --> 01:04:04,077
Almost taking his place.

1006
01:04:05,757 --> 01:04:07,597
Up to a point.
Oh, yes, up to a point.

1007
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:10,517
It's not as though you and Gwen
were husband and wife.

1008
01:04:26,717 --> 01:04:29,997
Sergeant. We've just been talking
to Neville Hayward.

1009
01:04:29,997 --> 01:04:32,237
That sounds ominous.

1010
01:04:32,237 --> 01:04:34,197
What's he been telling you?

1011
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:52,637
Gwen, I was very interested in
your attitude towards children,

1012
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:56,157
and Neville told me about
your three miscarriages.

1013
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:58,317
He had no right.

1014
01:04:58,317 --> 01:05:02,397
Was your husband, was Ted, the
father in all three pregnancies?

1015
01:05:02,397 --> 01:05:04,597
Or am I right in thinking that,
in one case,

1016
01:05:04,597 --> 01:05:06,477
the father was Nick Cheyney?

1017
01:05:07,797 --> 01:05:10,877
This is none of your business.
I'm sorry but I think it is.

1018
01:05:10,877 --> 01:05:13,357
I am trying to find out who killed
Nick Cheyney.

1019
01:05:13,357 --> 01:05:16,997
Since I believe he was the father of
one of your unborn children,

1020
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:19,077
it's very much part of
my investigation.

1021
01:05:21,557 --> 01:05:24,917
Where's all this come from?
From your behaviour with Josh

1022
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:28,957
in the charity shop, when you found
out that Nick Cheyney was his father.

1023
01:05:28,957 --> 01:05:32,077
..that we know that Nick Cheyney
was Josh's father?

1024
01:05:32,077 --> 01:05:33,237
Oh, God!

1025
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,077
She was just about to go home,
actually.

1026
01:05:37,077 --> 01:05:39,477
Nick's death has really upset her.

1027
01:05:41,077 --> 01:05:43,877
I couldn't believe
that I was holding Nick's son

1028
01:05:43,877 --> 01:05:46,797
after I'd killed our own.

1029
01:05:48,997 --> 01:05:51,317
I so wanted to have that child.

1030
01:05:51,317 --> 01:05:55,117
But...I couldn't do it to Ted.

1031
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,237
Not after what we'd been through

1032
01:05:57,237 --> 01:06:00,997
and so I let him think that
I'd had a miscarriage.

1033
01:06:02,237 --> 01:06:04,357
What about Cheyney?

1034
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:06,837
He, erm...made all the arrangements.

1035
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:09,237
He was...good at that sort of thing.

1036
01:06:10,357 --> 01:06:13,037
Gwen, did you kill him?

1037
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:31,557
"They seek him here,
they seek him there."

1038
01:06:34,397 --> 01:06:36,357
And now I've found him.

1039
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:40,677
What the hell are you doing?
I thought somewhere private.

1040
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:46,597
Somewhere suitably murky...
for a grubby little revelation.

1041
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:51,477
Are you raving?
I know your secret.

1042
01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:53,757
You're mad!
And you do have a secret, don't you?

1043
01:06:53,757 --> 01:06:56,077
I know, because I have it...

1044
01:06:58,317 --> 01:07:00,517
..right here.

1045
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,677
You killed Ted.
No.

1046
01:07:02,677 --> 01:07:04,637
Your own brother.

1047
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:06,957
Just because he was married to Gwen.

1048
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:08,837
Is that what it was with Cheyney?

1049
01:07:10,117 --> 01:07:12,197
Was he too close to her
for your liking?

1050
01:07:16,037 --> 01:07:18,237
GWEN: Leave the village? Why?

1051
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:20,357
You can see the way
Barnaby's thinking.

1052
01:07:20,357 --> 01:07:22,517
That we're in this together.

1053
01:07:22,517 --> 01:07:26,197
That we've exacted some kind of
revenge on Nick Cheyney.

1054
01:07:26,197 --> 01:07:28,277
And why would he think that?

1055
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,837
Because he knows
Cheyney wrecked your life.

1056
01:07:30,837 --> 01:07:33,037
So trust me, please.

1057
01:07:33,037 --> 01:07:35,997
We have to leave this village
if we want to be together.

1058
01:07:35,997 --> 01:07:38,157
We are together.

1059
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:42,597
You know what I mean.

1060
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:44,997
Neville, I don't want to talk
about this.

1061
01:07:44,997 --> 01:07:48,317
No. I'm not allowed to mention
the way I really feel.

1062
01:07:48,317 --> 01:07:51,557
Talk about that love
that dare not speak its name.

1063
01:07:51,557 --> 01:07:53,437
Now you're being histrionic.

1064
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:56,757
You can give yourself to a callous
bastard like Nick Cheyney...

1065
01:07:56,757 --> 01:07:59,157
Stop it!
Where did I go wrong?

1066
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:03,037
Made the mistake of actually caring
for you,

1067
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,117
instead of treating you the way
every other man in your life did,
except Ted.

1068
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:09,997
How many times did you expect him
to look the other way?

1069
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:13,597
He never knew.

1070
01:08:13,597 --> 01:08:16,037
In our business? Impossible.

1071
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:19,797
You must have known
you were destroying him.

1072
01:08:19,797 --> 01:08:22,317
But you kept on playing the part.

1073
01:08:23,397 --> 01:08:26,517
"Poor Gwen, she was so in love
with Ted."

1074
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:30,277
Must have been to put up with
that brother of his all these years.

1075
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:34,117
I know why you've put up with me.
And it's never gonna happen.

1076
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:37,677
And if you can no longer accept
that, then you'd better leave.

1077
01:08:37,677 --> 01:08:39,437
Now!

1078
01:08:39,437 --> 01:08:41,357
MAN: Tom, you got five?

1079
01:08:52,397 --> 01:08:54,277
Oh, Raymond. It's you.

1080
01:08:57,637 --> 01:08:59,557
Not still down in the dumps?

1081
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:02,757
I've just had a terrible row
with Neville.

1082
01:09:02,757 --> 01:09:04,877
Well, that's not difficult. Here.

1083
01:09:04,877 --> 01:09:06,757
Have a few swigs of this.

1084
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:11,757
I thought you'd stopped drinking.
I have.

1085
01:09:11,757 --> 01:09:13,837
But I'm like an old Saint Bernard

1086
01:09:13,837 --> 01:09:15,837
bringing succour to those
that need it.

1087
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:28,197
So, you'll be on until two o'clock
and then...

1088
01:09:40,077 --> 01:09:43,077
You haven't seen Gwen, have you?
No, not for a while.

1089
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:45,517
But she wasn't feeling too good
earlier on.

1090
01:09:45,517 --> 01:09:47,757
She might have gone home
with Neville, then.

1091
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:49,877
More than likely.

1092
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:52,637

Bloody but unbowed.

1097
01:11:15,677 --> 01:11:18,317
In fact, not even bloody.

1098
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:20,717
What happened?
Had one of my turns.

1099
01:11:20,717 --> 01:11:22,597
Came off the road.

1100
01:11:23,477 --> 01:11:26,877
Still feel a bit groggy.
Right, I'll call for help.

1101
01:11:26,877 --> 01:11:28,837
Thanks. Mine's in the car.

1102
01:11:30,957 --> 01:11:34,237
Where are you going?
I forgot to turn the engine off.

1103
01:11:34,237 --> 01:11:36,557
No, wait a minute. You wait there.
I'll do that.

1104
01:11:50,157 --> 01:11:52,917
Right, rescue vehicle's on its way.

1105
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:55,357
Now, come on, Raymond.
Let's get you to A&E.

1106
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,477
Oh, there's no need for that.

1107
01:11:57,477 --> 01:11:59,517
Yes, there is.
Come on, no arguments.

1108
01:11:59,517 --> 01:12:01,437
You've gotta be checked out.
Come on.

1109
01:12:03,637 --> 01:12:05,997
Uh, tell me.

1110
01:12:05,997 --> 01:12:09,917
You and Gwen Morrison...
Why do you get on so well?

1111
01:12:10,957 --> 01:12:14,117
I suppose it's because we both
once cared for the same man.

1112
01:13:13,837 --> 01:13:17,437
I thought you were supposed to be
going out at eight.
It's nearly nine.

1113
01:13:17,437 --> 01:13:20,237
It's a girls' night out.
It's nothing to do with you.

1114
01:13:20,237 --> 01:13:23,877
Let's drop the pretence.
You're spending the night
with Jack Braxton.

1115
01:13:23,877 --> 01:13:27,597
Of course. I'm simply keeping up
the facade of civilised duplicity.

Just because I used Cheyney
for my business,

1119
01:13:37,277 --> 01:13:39,997
don't think that made me despise him
any the less,

1120
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:42,477
or myself for having anything to do
with him.

1121
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:44,597
Why are you telling me this?

1122
01:13:44,597 --> 01:13:46,837
Did you kill Nick?

1123
01:13:49,237 --> 01:13:51,277
I'm just saying...

1124
01:13:51,277 --> 01:13:53,517
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

1125
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:58,597

01:15:58,797 --> 01:16:01,237
OK, don't move! That's enough Ince!

1137
01:16:02,677 --> 01:16:03,957
Cuff him!

1138
01:16:07,517 --> 01:16:10,557
I mean, I love the idea but,
does it have to be the Sixties?

1139
01:16:10,557 --> 01:16:12,517
It makes it much more expensive.

1140
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:15,517
I know but we've got it down to
about three million dollars.

1141

We've got a production company
in Maryland... Mr Charteris.

01:16:18,757 --> 01:16:20,757
Oh. Chief Inspector.

1143
01:16:20,757 --> 01:16:24,277
There's been an attempted robbery
up at the Manor.

1144
01:16:24,277 --> 01:16:26,277
Terry.

1145
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:28,917
Uh...attempted?

1146
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,077
Yes, sir, attempted.

1147
01:16:31,077 --> 01:16:33,317
Fortunately, we caught them
in the act.

1148
01:16:36,277 --> 01:16:38,237

01:17:32,437 --> 01:17:34,557
I was going to give you a ring, Jed,

1152
01:17:34,557 --> 01:17:37,237
but I thought you'd prefer to hear
the news in person.

1153
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:42,117
All rounded up. Didn't have to use
the thumbscrews on Mr Ince.

1154
01:17:42,117 --> 01:17:44,437
He's already given us Charteris's
name.

1155
01:17:44,437 --> 01:17:48,237
And yours. Just as well you decided
to change sides, eh?

1156
01:17:48,237 --> 01:17:50,477
So a big thank you.

1157
01:17:50,477 --> 01:17:54,357
By the way, somebody tried to break
into the props store earlier.

1158
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:57,277
But we didn't find anyone.
We?

1159
01:17:57,277 --> 01:17:59,877
Me and your PC,
guarding the guillotine.

Oh, my...
Gwen.

1164
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:48,063
There's no sign of Neville
and his car's missing.

1165
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,023
I've put out an APB.

1166
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:54,463
Ah! The law never sleeps, eh?

1167
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,983
A bit early in the day
to come calling, though.

1168
01:18:58,983 --> 01:19:02,463
Could say the same for you. No car.
I've come to cadge a lift from Gwen.

1169
01:19:05,223 --> 01:19:07,423
What?

1170
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:09,543
Gwen Morrison won't be going to work
today.

1171
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:12,263
(MOCK GASP) Full name?
That sounded official.

1172
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:15,303
Gwen... Gwen's body was found
at the guillotine

1173
01:19:15,303 --> 01:19:17,183
in the early hours of this morning.

1174
01:19:19,143 --> 01:19:21,263
Body?

1175
01:19:21,263 --> 01:19:23,143
She's been beheaded.

1176
01:19:36,983 --> 01:19:40,663
I keep trying to picture it
and block it out of my mind
at the same time.

1177
01:19:42,223 --> 01:19:44,143
Oh, God.

1178
01:19:46,143 --> 01:19:48,103
How's Neville taking it?

1179
01:19:48,103 --> 01:19:50,143
Well, we'll know that
when we find him.

1180
01:19:50,143 --> 01:19:52,183
Gone missing?
It appears so, yes.

1181
01:19:52,183 --> 01:19:54,703
Well, does that mean...?
Does it mean what?

1182
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:56,943
Well, Gwen dead.
Neville gone missing...

1183
01:19:59,543 --> 01:20:03,343
Do you think it's likely
that Neville would have harmed her?

1184
01:20:03,343 --> 01:20:07,303
Gwen? No, no. He'd love to get me
under that blade, but Gwen, never!

1185
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,743
There's no love lost
between you two, is there?

1186
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,463
I'm afraid I might be partly
responsible...

1187
01:20:15,903 --> 01:20:18,103
..for him disappearing.
What's this?

1188
01:20:18,103 --> 01:20:20,303
An anonymous letter.

1189
01:20:20,303 --> 01:20:22,623
Well, it was sent to Ted
anonymously, anyway.

1190
01:20:23,823 --> 01:20:26,183
Telling him about his wife
and Nick Cheyney.

1191
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:30,143
Did Ted know
who was responsible for this?

1192
01:20:30,143 --> 01:20:33,223
No but it had to be from somebody
wanting the marriage to break up.

1193
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:37,583
Someone who was willing to spend
15 years of his life with Gwen

1194
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,223
without ever letting
his true feelings show?

1195
01:20:40,223 --> 01:20:42,503
That's why you're
the Chief Inspector.

1196
01:20:42,503 --> 01:20:44,983
Took me years to work that out.

1197
01:20:44,983 --> 01:20:47,183
What did you do with it?

1198
01:20:47,183 --> 01:20:49,863
Oh, I confronted him with it
yesterday.

1199
01:20:49,863 --> 01:20:52,063
A grubby little revelation.

1200
01:20:52,063 --> 01:20:54,303
He was a snivelling wreck.

1201
01:20:54,303 --> 01:20:56,223
Because I have it...

1202
01:20:57,863 --> 01:21:00,063
right here.

1203
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:02,543
'Especially when I threatened to
show it to Gwen.'

1204
01:21:02,543 --> 01:21:04,423
And what would that achieve?

1205
01:21:05,743 --> 01:21:10,183
It was a bluff.
I wouldn't have done that to her.

1206
01:21:10,183 --> 01:21:12,423
But Neville didn't know
you were bluffing.

1207
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:15,583
No.

1208
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:18,143
I thought he deserved to sweat.

1209
01:21:30,023 --> 01:21:34,143
You know, Raymond, if Neville felt
that strongly about Gwen,

1210
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:37,423
it must have been hard for him
just living with her as a friend.

1211
01:21:37,423 --> 01:21:42,103
Torture. But you'd be surprised
how little someone will settle for
when they're in love.

1212
01:21:42,103 --> 01:21:44,223
Mr Braxton...

1213
01:21:44,223 --> 01:21:46,383
You know why I'm here.

1214
01:21:46,383 --> 01:21:48,823
You're closing us down.
That is correct.

1215
01:21:48,823 --> 01:21:51,863
Before you make the announcement,
may I just say a few words?

1216
01:21:51,863 --> 01:21:53,703
Make it brief.

1217
01:21:54,863 --> 01:21:56,743
Ladies and gentlemen.

1218
01:21:57,983 --> 01:21:59,983
Could I have your attention, please?

1219
01:22:01,063 --> 01:22:03,343
Quiet, please!
We're going for a take!

1220
01:22:03,343 --> 01:22:05,383
Quiet, please!
Quiet, please!

1221
01:22:06,743 --> 01:22:10,623
Thank you. Erm...I just wanted to
say a few words about Gwen.

1222
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:16,663
Most of us knew her
in some capacity or other.

1223
01:22:16,663 --> 01:22:20,783
The people of the village remember
a compassionate and caring woman.

1224
01:22:20,783 --> 01:22:23,823
The more venerable among us
in the acting profession

1225
01:22:23,823 --> 01:22:25,983
knew that side of her too,

1226
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:29,503
but we also remember a performer
who was game for anything.

1227
01:22:31,303 --> 01:22:34,903
Who can forget the leather bikini,
the whip and the stuffed swan?

1228
01:22:36,463 --> 01:22:38,383
The Lovely Leida.

1229
01:22:39,063 --> 01:22:42,663
Well, the point is Gwen was
a very special person,

1230
01:22:42,663 --> 01:22:45,583
and however we choose
to remember her,

1231
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:47,983
we should do our best
to keep that memory alive.

1232
01:22:49,343 --> 01:22:51,263
Thank you.

1233
01:22:53,543 --> 01:22:55,503
"The Lovely Leida"?

1234
01:22:56,743 --> 01:23:00,463
There was a side to Gwen
that you knew nothing about
in Midsomer Magna.

1235
01:23:09,063 --> 01:23:11,223
So Gwen hadn't returned home

1236
01:23:11,223 --> 01:23:14,143
by the time you left the house
yesterday evening, right?

1237
01:23:14,143 --> 01:23:16,023
I didn't expect her to.

1238
01:23:17,063 --> 01:23:19,223
Why is that?

1239
01:23:19,223 --> 01:23:22,343
I thought she was deliberately
staying away till I'd gone.

1240
01:23:23,943 --> 01:23:26,063
Had she asked you to leave?

1241
01:23:29,383 --> 01:23:31,303
Where did you plan to go?

1242
01:23:32,343 --> 01:23:34,263
Plan?

1243
01:23:35,943 --> 01:23:37,863
Do I look as though I had a plan?

1244
01:23:43,943 --> 01:23:47,663
You know, everything points to
Neville Hayward, sir.

1245
01:23:47,663 --> 01:23:50,663
Except for the fact that we picked
him up at a 24-hour diner

1246
01:23:50,663 --> 01:23:54,223
and the staff say he'd been sitting
there since yesterday evening.

1247
01:23:54,223 --> 01:23:57,023
All during the time Gwen Morrison
was guillotined.

1248
01:23:57,023 --> 01:23:58,823
So we let him go?

1249
01:23:58,823 --> 01:24:00,823
Yes, well,
we've got no choice, have we?

1250
01:24:02,783 --> 01:24:05,223
Tell him not to leave the house
without notifying us.

1251
01:24:09,423 --> 01:24:12,103
DS Jones. Yeah.

1252
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:14,983
Take Neville Hayward home, please.
Thanks.

1253
01:24:31,863 --> 01:24:33,703
On my way home, Tom.
George.

1254
01:24:34,423 --> 01:24:37,663
But...we found traces of Oramorph
in Gwen Morrison's body.

1255
01:24:37,663 --> 01:24:39,463
Did you?

1256
01:24:39,463 --> 01:24:42,063
Enough to render her unconscious
before she was killed?

1257
01:24:42,063 --> 01:24:45,023
Definitely.
So they were both unconscious

1258
01:24:45,023 --> 01:24:48,463
by the time the killer laid them
under the blade of the guillotine.

1259
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:51,543
That's why there was no sign of a
struggle from either her or Cheyney.

1260
01:24:51,543 --> 01:24:53,663
I still don't see how it's possible

1261
01:24:53,663 --> 01:24:55,943
to get them there without being seen
or heard.

1262
01:24:55,943 --> 01:24:57,903
No, me neither. Especially Gwen.

1263
01:24:57,903 --> 01:25:01,343
I mean, OK, the killer broke into
the props store as a diversion

1264
01:25:01,343 --> 01:25:04,303
but that wouldn't have given him
the time he needed, would it? No.

1265
01:25:05,423 --> 01:25:06,703
Unless...

1266
01:25:14,223 --> 01:25:17,703
Unless the body was already
at the guillotine.

1267
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:22,423
The cart full of headless dummies.

1268
01:25:22,423 --> 01:25:25,263
Sir?
Headless dummies, Jones.

1269
01:25:25,263 --> 01:25:28,103
He should have been driving them
away from the guillotine,

1270
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:29,823
not towards it! George...

1271
01:25:31,023 --> 01:25:33,943
Come back, I want you to be part of
this. The Oramorph.

1272
01:25:33,943 --> 01:25:36,663
you said it was available
on prescription, yes?

1273
01:25:36,663 --> 01:25:40,023
At any high street chemist.
Or hospital pharmacy.

1274
01:25:40,023 --> 01:25:42,303
That's how he knew where it was.

1275
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:45,623
Raymond, let's get you to A&E.
Oh, there's no need for that.

1276
01:25:45,623 --> 01:25:47,903
Oh, yes, there is.
Come on, no arguments.

1277
01:25:47,903 --> 01:25:50,503
When I drove him to the hospital
there were roadworks.

1278
01:25:50,503 --> 01:25:53,143
There were diversions,
but he knew the way round them.

1279
01:25:53,143 --> 01:25:55,543
Because he'd been there before.

1280
01:25:55,543 --> 01:25:57,543
Is he suffering from
terminal cancer?

1281
01:25:59,503 --> 01:26:02,943
Any way of confirming that, George?
A post mortem.

1282
01:26:02,943 --> 01:26:05,503
Well, use your clout
with the hospital.

1283
01:26:05,503 --> 01:26:08,983
Not in my remit.
Thank you, George. Thank you.

1284
01:26:16,063 --> 01:26:18,263
I don't any more, as you know.

1285
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:21,063
But I thought you might like
a little pick-me-up.

1286
01:26:21,063 --> 01:26:22,823
Oh.

1287
01:26:23,783 --> 01:26:27,103
You suspected, didn't you, that
Neville was in love with Raymond

1288
01:26:27,103 --> 01:26:29,823
and jealous of him spending so much
time with Ted.

1289
01:26:29,823 --> 01:26:33,503
That's when I thought Neville was
gay, but he isn't. But Raymond is!

1290
01:26:33,503 --> 01:26:36,863
What if, during the many hours he
spent consoling Ted

1291
01:26:36,863 --> 01:26:40,223
in the various pubs and bars,
Raymond fell in love with him?

1292
01:26:40,223 --> 01:26:42,263
Without Ted realising?

1293
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:45,023
And when Ted died of the booze
and the broken heart,

1294
01:26:45,023 --> 01:26:47,183
caused by Gwen and Cheyney,

1295
01:26:47,183 --> 01:26:50,343
then Raymond would have been
devastated and very angry.

1296
01:26:50,343 --> 01:26:52,623
But why wait 15 years
to take your revenge?

1297
01:26:53,503 --> 01:26:56,463
He's dying.
He's got nothing left to lose.

1298
01:26:56,463 --> 01:26:58,663
He's settling old scores.

1299
01:27:00,143 --> 01:27:01,743
And his car...

1300
01:27:04,743 --> 01:27:07,183
I didn't realise
it was still running.

1301
01:27:07,183 --> 01:27:10,423
His engine was still running...
but I couldn't hear it.

1302
01:27:10,423 --> 01:27:13,903
It explains why Freddie Greenaway
didn't hear a second car engine

1303
01:27:13,903 --> 01:27:16,943
outside the hotel the night of
Cheyney's murder, doesn't it?

1304
01:27:16,943 --> 01:27:19,703
Clandillon took Cheyney to the film
set in his car.

1305
01:27:19,703 --> 01:27:21,863
If he was in love with Ted,

1306
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:24,263
he'd have a reason
to kill Cheyney and Gwen.

1307
01:27:24,263 --> 01:27:26,663
And Neville Hayward...

1308
01:27:26,663 --> 01:27:29,183
for sending Ted that letter.

1309
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:33,463
DOORBELL

1310
01:27:45,183 --> 01:27:47,183
No sign of movement, sir.

1311
01:27:47,183 --> 01:27:49,103
Film set.

1312
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,543
(RAYMOND GROANS)

1313
01:27:59,383 --> 01:28:01,063
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS

1314
01:28:06,183 --> 01:28:08,103
Chief Inspector.

1315
01:28:08,943 --> 01:28:11,463
I must applaud your sense
of the dramatic.

1316
01:28:11,463 --> 01:28:15,463
Unfortunately, your timing's
just a little bit out.

1317
01:28:15,463 --> 01:28:17,503
There is no point in this.

1318
01:28:17,503 --> 01:28:19,383
Oh, I think there is.

1319
01:28:20,423 --> 01:28:23,743
I'm not prepared to let the people
responsible for Ted's death...

1320
01:28:23,743 --> 01:28:25,543
go unpunished.

1321
01:28:25,543 --> 01:28:29,103
But you've already done what
you've set out to do, haven't you?

1322
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:32,183
You came to Midsomer to catch up
with Nick Cheyney

1323
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:33,903
and you've done that.

1324
01:28:33,903 --> 01:28:37,543
And having Gwen here made it so much
easier to lure him to his fate.

1325
01:28:42,223 --> 01:28:44,463
'You waited outside the hotel

1326
01:28:44,463 --> 01:28:47,103
for him to get back from his dinner
at the Manor.

1327
01:28:47,103 --> 01:28:49,623
And you knew he'd be drunk,
didn't you?

1328
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:52,943
And then what? I suppose you told
him that Gwen wanted to see him?'

1329
01:28:52,943 --> 01:28:56,023
'Given the history between them,
I knew he'd be curious.'

1330
01:28:56,023 --> 01:28:58,903
(LAUGHS) Top quality malt.

1331
01:29:01,143 --> 01:29:03,263
I knew it!
I knew you were still drinking.

1332
01:29:04,623 --> 01:29:08,343
I suppose you know this means
you're fired. Finish it off.

1333
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,303
'The whisky was spiked with
Oramorph.'

1334
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,383
You have been doing your homework.

1335
01:29:13,663 --> 01:29:17,423
And then what? I suppose you parked
a little way away from the film set

1336
01:29:17,423 --> 01:29:20,223
and advised Cheyney
to get rid of the security guard

1337
01:29:20,223 --> 01:29:22,543
so his meeting with Gwen
wouldn't be seen.

1338
01:29:22,543 --> 01:29:26,143
It's as though you were there.
You're dying, Raymond.

1339
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:28,143
Why would you be bothered about
being caught?

1340
01:29:28,143 --> 01:29:30,223
Well, I wasn't.

1341
01:29:31,143 --> 01:29:34,903
And there was still Gwen and Neville
to be taken care of.

1342
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:38,383
Raymond... Cheyney I can understand.
Neville, yes, maybe.

1343
01:29:38,383 --> 01:29:40,543
But Gwen? I mean, why Gwen?

1344
01:29:40,543 --> 01:29:43,063
Surely Gwen was the...chief victim?

1345
01:29:43,063 --> 01:29:45,263
Victim?!

1346
01:29:45,263 --> 01:29:49,783
Gwen was a more than willing partner
in their squalid little affair.

1347
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:53,423
So in your eyes
she was as guilty as Cheyney.

1348
01:29:53,423 --> 01:29:55,303
More so.

1349
01:29:57,663 --> 01:29:59,703
Oh, Raymond. It's you.

1350
01:29:59,703 --> 01:30:02,143
'I bided my time.

1351
01:30:02,143 --> 01:30:04,903
Gave her a few swigs
from my hip flask.

1352
01:30:04,903 --> 01:30:06,783
Specially prepared.'

1353
01:30:08,183 --> 01:30:10,103
'Whisky and Oramorph.'

1354
01:30:16,303 --> 01:30:20,463
Do you know, Raymond?
You are doing him a great favour.

1355
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:25,863
You think so?
Yes, I do.

1356
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:30,823
He wouldn't want to wake up to
the memories he'd have to live with.

1357
01:30:30,823 --> 01:30:32,943
CRUNCH
Don't come any closer, Sergeant.

1358
01:30:34,943 --> 01:30:37,103
(MOUTHS)

1359
01:30:37,103 --> 01:30:41,183
A rather squalid attempt at
reverse psychology, Chief Inspector.

1360
01:30:43,143 --> 01:30:45,103
But it's worked.

1361
01:30:46,063 --> 01:30:50,463
He'd much prefer oblivion...
to a living hell.

1362
01:30:52,663 --> 01:30:54,623
Here.

1363
01:30:56,223 --> 01:30:58,183
You want this.

1364
01:31:00,783 --> 01:31:02,703
No, not really.

1365
01:31:03,703 --> 01:31:05,623
I had that lock changed.

1366
01:31:07,823 --> 01:31:09,863
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1367
01:31:09,863 --> 01:31:12,623
And I made the noble gesture.

1368
01:31:12,623 --> 01:31:16,103
Appropriate, really...
the Scarlet Pimpernel.

1369
01:31:17,743 --> 01:31:21,503
"It's a far, far better thing
I do..."

1370
01:31:21,503 --> 01:31:23,903
That's A Tale Of Two Cities.
Is it?

1371
01:31:26,863 --> 01:31:29,023
Typical of my life.

1372
01:31:31,303 --> 01:31:33,663
I'm in someone else's story again.

1373
01:31:48,863 --> 01:31:52,103
By the way, thanks for telling me
about changing the lock.

1374
01:31:52,103 --> 01:31:54,423
Oh, sorry.
I was sweating cobs back there.

1375
01:31:54,423 --> 01:31:56,743
Yeah, sorry.
It was a last-minute decision.

1376
01:31:56,743 --> 01:31:59,503
Oh, it's just as well.
He was going for the hat trick.

1377
01:31:59,503 --> 01:32:02,063
I mean Cheyney, Neville,
I can understand.

1378
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:04,783
But I had no idea how he really felt
about Gwen.
