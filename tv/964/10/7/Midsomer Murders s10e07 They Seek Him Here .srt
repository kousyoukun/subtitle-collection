No! Please! No! No!

00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,999
CHEERING

6
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,679
BOOING

7
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,839
(WAILS) No!

8
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,519
No!

00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:16,387
MAN: Cut!

10
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:18,867
Cut.
OK, reset, everybody.

11
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,307
Reset. We're running out of blood.

12
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:41,267
BLEEPS

13
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,707
I've got something interesting, sir.
I'm tailing George Ince.

14
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,827
BARNABY: George Ince? Really?

15
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:54,187
'Yeah, it's definitely him.'
That is not good news.

16
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,787
With a bit of luck, he'll drive onto
someone else's patch.

17
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:08,347
And he's heading towards
Midsomer Magna.

18
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,987
Then, Jones, it falls to us
to protect

19
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:15,027
the wealthier citizens of Midsomer
from Mr Ince's thieving ways.

20
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:28,907
(CLEARS THROAT
AND MUTTERS TO HIMSELF)

21
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:40,747
How does this sound? "It is a
little-known fact that, in 1905,

22
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:43,787
the Hungarian aristocrat and writer,
Baroness Orczy,

23
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:47,387
was a guest of Lord Fitzgibbon
at Midsomer Magna Manor."

24
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:53,427
What's wrong?
Neville, don't. Please.

25
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,427
You could have let me finish.

26
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:58,427
You were going to say the woman who
wrote the Scarlet Pimpernel

27
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:02,547
based the character of Sir Percy
Blakeney on Lord Fitzgibbon,

28
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:05,427
who owned Magna Manor at the turn
of the last century.

29
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:08,187
Well...yes.

30
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,787
We know she never went near the
place, never mind met his Lordship.

31
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,787
WE know that.

32
00:03:13,787 --> 00:03:17,267
Given that they're filming that very
book in the grounds of the manor,

33
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,867
don't you think it'll be a tad
obvious to everyone else?

34
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:23,147
You're right.

35
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:28,107
The occasional embellishment
to the history of a place,

36
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,667
I mean, everyone does that.
But Terence Charteris had no right

37
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,347
to ask you to lie to blatantly.

38
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,947
If I don't play along,
I lose the job.

39
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:39,587
Where else am I going to find work
in Midsomer Magna?

40
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:43,667
They're still hiring extras
on the film.

41
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:47,307
You could have a dip back into
the business, for old times' sake.

42
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:50,907
You obviously don't know
who's directing this film. Who?

43
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,187
Three, two, one, drop!

44
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:15,067
Cut it!

45
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:18,027
82, take 1.

46
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,267
And, action!

47
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,147
CHEERING

48
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:31,987
Cut it.

49
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:39,227
Nick, these execution scenes -
I know, I know.

50
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:41,187
Enough blood to float an abattoir.

51
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:43,507
I'll get special effects
to turn it down.

52
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:47,747
Good grief, no. If anything, we need
more blood. Buckets of the stuff.

53
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:50,107
Know your audience.

54
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:55,427
It's not as if you're directing
an art-house movie, is it?

55
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:10,427
Ah, Jones. So, Mr Ince is here.

56
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:13,027
They're opening the place
to the public, sir.

57
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:15,627
Apparently, it's got historic
connections

58
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,627
with the French Revolution.
Doing a film, aren't they?

59
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:20,467
The Scarlet Pimpernel.

60
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,347
What you might call a remake
of a remake of a remake.

61
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:26,547
Yes, Joyce mentioned something
about it. Where is he now?

62
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:28,747
Parked up round the side.

63
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:32,227
Your informant has got to be right
about Ince setting up a job.

64
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:35,027
What other interest could he have in
a stately home?

65
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:37,907
Maybe he's come for a dose of
culture and a guided tour.

66
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:41,267
Although George prefers to guide
himself round places like this.

67
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:45,867
And usually by torchlight when
there's no-one else about.
Let's find out what he's up to.

68
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,307
'Three, two, one, drop.

69
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:53,467
Cut it.
82, take 1.

70
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,187
Action.'

71
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,107
CROWD CHEERS

72
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:05,387
Something else not right about
that scene. Enlighten me.

73
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:08,467
Not enough peasants.
You want me to reshoot?

74
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:11,667
Oh, God, no. But for future scenes,
you'll need more crones and hags.

75
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:15,707
Crones and hags.
I'll see what I can conjure up.

76
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:18,827
Don't make hard work of it.
An area like this must be overrun

77
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,987
with yokels and inbreds.

78
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:24,307
Why don't you try the local
old folks' home. They'll come cheap.

79
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,907
'And drop.'

80
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:50,187
There he is.
Look who he's with.

81
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:52,027
Jed Norris!

82
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:53,947
Talk about thick as thieves, eh?

83
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,987
No, leave it, leave it.
You'll get nothing from him.

84
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:00,827
A word with Mr Norris might prove
more useful.

85
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,707
I can see exactly why you're
going for this heritage scam.

86
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:10,147
Do you have to use that word?
I'm joking, Diane.

87
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:15,027
No, I mean it certainly looks like
an authentic historical pile.

88
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:19,667
From what I gather it's getting more
authentically historical by the day.

89
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,587
(LAUGHS) Got a man working on it.

90
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,947
Local historian.

91
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:27,707
Historian?
Oh, you don't need one of them.

92
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:31,107
Dip into Hans Christian Andersen.
He was good with fairytales.

93
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,627
Listen, Terence...

94
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:39,547
I'm not sure how much more I can
take of Jack Braxton.

95
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:42,267
The man's a philistine.
Ooh!

96
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:46,067
You want the producer sacked, you'll
have to clear that with Diane.

97
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:50,867
Why's that?
Because they're very good friends.

98
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,787
I didn't even know you knew him.
He's being facetious.

99
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:56,667
I don't understand.
It may have escaped your notice,

100
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,827
but this marriage is on the rocks.

101
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:03,147
We're just trying to hold things
together till we get the business
off the ground.

102
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:05,307
So you and Braxton are er...

103
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,067
Close.
(SNORTS)

104
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:12,427
Ah!

105
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:15,307
Well, even so. He's a hatchet man.
Known for it.

106
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,387
He's the producer.
Money men have to be like that.

107
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,867
We want this film to look
as good as possible, don't we?

108
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:26,347
I mean...don't we?

109
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,267
Look, Nick...

110
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:34,707
I know you see this as a chance
to get your career back on track,

111
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:38,547
but to us it's just business, OK?

112
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,627
Right, well...thanks for putting me
in the picture.

113
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,147
I'd better get back to set.

114
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:48,387
Actors to execute.

115
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,467
I'll see you both tomorrow night,
then.

116
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,387
Keep up the good work.

117
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:01,667
I don't know how you can bear
that man in the house

118
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,667
after the way he's treated
our daughter.

119
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,587
How do you think Leonie feels
about this?

120
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,267
Diane, there's family
and there's business.

121
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:14,627
Right now, the family business
is in trouble. We need Nick Cheyney.

122
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,507
So Leonie's just gonna have to
lump it. All right?

123
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:38,467
Hello, Jed! I didn't think
you were due for release just yet.

124
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:41,107
Parole. Good behaviour.

125
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,347
Ah! Well, congratulations.

126
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:45,547
Yeah, I think they needed
the cell space.

127
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:48,627
I'm telling you, overcrowding in
prisons is criminal.

128
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,907
So it's not somewhere
you want to rush back to?

129
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,827
Never again.
I can't handle any more.

130
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,747
So why the meeting with George Ince?

131
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,947
It wasn't a meeting.

132
00:09:56,947 --> 00:10:00,187
I just happened to bump into him.
Small world (!)

133
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:02,267
What's he doing here?

134
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,467
You don't ask people like George
their business.

135
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:08,467
No, you don't. Nasty piece of work.
So what are you doing at Magna Manor?

136
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,387
I'm working here.
You? Work!

137
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,987
That's right. Big laugh!

138
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:16,547
Excuse me.

139
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:18,467
Thank you.

140
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:23,507
No meeting between Jed Norris
and George Ince is coincidental.

141
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,467
Get hold of the management here.

142
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:28,027
If anything untoward happens,
I want to know about it.

143
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,307
Sir.

144
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:32,187
Can you get over to the props boys?

145
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,507
(GROANS) Nick, erm, these are the
old folk from The Cedars.

146
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,347
Crones and hags. As ordered.

147
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:49,227
Right. Well, get them fitted out
with rags.

148
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,707
I want them on set
at eight tomorrow morning.

149
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:53,787
Some of them are over 80,
Mr Cheyney.

150
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,387
(SIGHS) Nine, then.

151
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,307
It's a bit late. We've gotta get
the costumes ready...

152
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:04,027
Nick?

153
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,187
Gwen? Gwen Morrison?

154
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:11,107
You do remember me.

155
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:12,947
Always! But, uh...

156
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:15,587
Well, it must be what erm...

157
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:19,707
17 years.
No! No, not that long, surely.

158
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:23,387
Well, I've lived in this village
for 15 of them. Ever since Ted died.

159
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:25,427
Ted died?

160
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:30,347
So you're um...on your own, then?

161
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:33,587
No, no. I live with Neville.
You remember Neville.

162
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:36,027
(LAUGHS) Of course! Neville!

163
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,547
I might've known
he'd still be around.

164
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:43,547
Listen, darling,
I really can't talk now but, er...

165
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,427
I'll catch you later, all right?

166
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:48,147
Gwen Morrison.

167
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,187
WOMAN: Excuse me! Excuse me!

168
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:03,147
It's not as though you're asking me
to update the history of the Manor.

169
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:05,227
That is exactly what I'm asking you
to do.

170
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:07,507
But what you want is pure fantasy.

171
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:11,187
Erm... Your point?

172
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:14,707
It's not ethical.

173
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:18,187
And it shouldn't be part of my remit
as Events Organiser of the Manor.

174
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:20,587
(SNORTS) Don't flatter yourself.

175
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:23,467
Part-time tour guide
was all you were ever gonna be.

176
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,627
Were?

177
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,307
I need to get this place
open to the public ASAP.

178
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:30,547
Till then,
I'm just haemorrhaging money.

179
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:33,307
So I can't afford to have losers
like you holding me back.

180
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:35,187
Go on, you're fired!

181
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,587
What're you waiting for?

182
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,547
Right, bye.

183
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:47,547
How come you're at Gwen's?
It was a bit chaotic today.

184
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,627
Ooh, sounds exciting.
It was.

185
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:52,107
We were up at The Cedars
on charity shop business

186
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,067
when someone came round
from the film unit

187
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,627
to recruit the old folk as extras.

188
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,787
They need more "crones and hags".

189
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:02,427
Crones? They actually used those
terms? Not that any of us minded.

190
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:05,787
Most of us are thrilled to bits
to be in The Scarlet Pimpernel.

191
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,587
Us? Gwen and I volunteered
to be chaperones,

192
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,027
so we thought we might as well be
extras too.

193
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:13,627
Following in your daughter's
footsteps, eh?

194
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,907
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
Oh, hello, Neville.

195
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:19,587
Jones? 'Sir, report of a prowler,
Magna Manor.'

196
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:22,187
You think it could be Ince?
'Looks like it, sir.'

197
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,827
Right, get yourself some back-up.
I'll be right there.

198
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,507
DOOR CLOSES

199
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:34,827
Well, I challenged him...
and he fired me.

200
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:39,067
A week before the place is due
to open to the public?

201
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,627
I've picked up on what's happening.

202
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:46,227
Terence Charteris may live in
a manor house,

203
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:48,627
but he's a barrow boy
out of his depth.

204
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,907
He's over-stretched himself
and he's about to go under.

205
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,987
I don't think he could afford
to pay me.

206
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:57,307
Well, no great loss, if you ask me.

207
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:01,107
I mean, why not sign up as an extra?

208
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:10,507
He's round the back somewhere.
Right, Jones, off you go.

209
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,347
I have to tell you if he's the man
we think he is,

210
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:16,147
he has a history of violence.

211
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,667
Your husband's not out looking
for him, is he?

212
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,587
My husband's gone out
for the evening.

213
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:35,187
Police! Stop!

214
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,547
SIREN BLARES

215
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,547
Gotcha!

216
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,347
Oi!

217
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:03,027
What's going on?
Better late than never.

218
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,787
Diane, what is going on?
A prowler.

219
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:09,547
Prowler? Where?
Standing in front of you!

220
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:11,987
Don't be ridiculous -
he's the security guard!

221
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:14,347
Since when?
A couple of days ago.

222
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,467
Oh, well, thank you for telling me.

223
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,587
Then why did you run away?
I didn't know who you were.

224
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,427
I shouted "police".
Anybody could do that.

225
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:26,987
Security guard for the Manor?
And for the film set.

226
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:31,147
Made sense, him keeping an eye
on things over.
So I had a word with Jack Braxton.

227
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,667
Who's he?
The film's producer.

228
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:43,947
Jed Norris, a security guard?

229
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:47,027
Talk about putting the fox in charge
of the hen house.

230
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:49,427
Our friend Ince must be involved
in this.

231
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:52,107
That producer needs to know
what he's taken on.

232
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:56,995
OK, where's your Mum.

233
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:04,755
Come on, Leonie.
OK, I'm coming.

234
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,035
Take...take that one.

235
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:13,515
You know Gwen's got
a job as an extra on this film,

236
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,315
so I'm on my own in the charity shop
today. Oh, hello!

237
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:20,275
I was watching that Nick Cheyney
on set all day yesterday. What?

238
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:25,835
You didn't say anything to him?

239
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:29,355
Danny, please. You promised.
Leave him to me.

240
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,795
I want Cheyney out of our lives,
Leonie. For good.

241
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:50,555
Sir...five years ago,
when Ince was on remand,

242
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:53,555
he and Norris were briefly
in Causton Jail together.

243
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,475
They're old acquaintances.

244
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:58,475
And Mr Norris has just conned
his way into a security job.

245
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,395
Pull him in for questioning, sir?

246
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,115
Jed's not really in the same league
as Ince, is he?

247
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,795
Just, er, cut him a bit of slack,
keep an eye on him.

248
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:07,835
George Ince is the man
we really want

249
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:11,235
and if Jed Norris can lead us to him,
well, that'd be a result.

250
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,875
Come on, Gwen.
You'll get the old folk fired

251
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,715
if I don't get them to the set
on time.

252
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:23,635
Why don't you help Joyce with the
old folk today?

253
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,315
I'll stay here and look after Josh.

254
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,915
No, thanks. I'm not going anywhere
near that film set.

255
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,795
Come on, we're out of here.

256
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,835
Let's say bye to Auntie Gwen. Bye!

257
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,715
Bye, Josh.

258
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,955
Bye, Leonie.
Bye. Right...

259
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:42,315
Right!

260
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:44,235
MAN: All right! Mind your backs!

261
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:47,275
Out the way, please! And you!

262
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,635
Joyce!

263
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:12,675
Aristos to the carriage, please.

264
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:16,355
Costume checks, please.

265
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:20,355
So, you say this guy Norris
has got form?

266
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,235
Just a bit.

267
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,875
What do you recommend?
I'd like you to keep him on.

268
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,835
At least then we'll know where he is
during the shoot.

269
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:31,795
And, between you and me,
he might prove a useful lead

270
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,155
to someone else
we want to keep tabs on.

271
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,115
Suits me. He has all the
qualifications I need. He's cheap.

272
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,995
What? Tight budget, this film?

273
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,155
(LAUGHS) Like a tourniquet.

274
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:45,395
We'd have half a chance if someone
other than that clown of a director

275
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:47,475
was calling the shots
from behind the camera.

276
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:49,595
But you're the producer, aren't you?

277
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,835
I mean, don't you appoint
the director?

278
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:54,755
I do. And ordinarily I wouldn't
touch Nick Cheyney.

279
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:57,955
But he brokered the deal that got us
this location for free.

280
00:18:57,955 --> 00:19:00,635
Knows the people who own the Manor.

281
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:03,595
Ah, Mr And Mrs Charteris.
Friends of yours?

282
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:06,155
No, we don't move in
the same social circles.

283
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:10,275
Lucky you. The wife's OK,
her husband's a complete philistine.

284
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,395
The people we have to get into bed
with to get a movie made.

285
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,595
Figure of speech.

286
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:22,435
Mrs Barnaby looks very fetching
in that red cap, sir.

287
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,915
Peasants behind the cart, thank you!

288
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:37,555
Now, I need you to start in line
with the arch, all right?

289
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:40,875
Can we get some quiet, please,
and a bit of concentration?

290
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,115
All right, now, the...
Let's just have a look, love, OK?

291
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,995
The rider's gonna come galloping in
down here, all right?

292
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,995
Can we finish checks now, please?

293
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:51,955
Rider comes galloping in,
gives you the news from Paris.

294
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:55,475
Get out of here, no time to lose.
Barbarous hordes on their way.

295
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:59,275
Now, you're horrified but dignified.
Remember, you're French aristocrats.

296
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:04,195
That's all right.
Can we get the coats off, please?

297
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:06,555
Quieten down!
Can we get the coats off now!

298
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,635
Coats off, Nigel!
Going for a take.

299
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,675
Right. Going for a take!
All right, standing by for a take.

300
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:12,995
Turn over!
Speed!

301
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,875
Sound running!
Mark it!

302
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,795
143 take 1.

303
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,635
Background action!

304
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,395
And...action!

305
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:32,155
Go! Go! Go!

306
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,515
And stop!

307
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,115
And run back! Go!

308
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,995
CAR HORN: ODE TO JOY

309
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,675
What the hell is that?!

310
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:47,275
Cut!
Cut!

311
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:49,435
And we've cut there, we've cut!

312
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,595
Reset!
Reset!

313
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:55,235
First positions, everybody.
I know that car. It can't be!

314
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,395
Throw him off the set.

315
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:02,075
'Scuse me, 'scuse me!
You can't park here! Ah, Nick!

316
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:05,195
Hope I didn't disturb anything.

317
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:08,555
No-one makes an entrance
quite like Raymond Clandillon.

318
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:11,635
Dying art, I'm afraid.
I try to keep it going.

319
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:15,115
Just passing? No. Thought I'd stop
for a while. Get involved.

320
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,835
Yeah, well I'm afraid the film's
already cast. I know.

321
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:20,635
According to this there's
not a D-list celeb

322
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:23,795
or clapped out sports star
to be found anywhere.

323
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:26,595
You've got them all.
So no room for you, then.

324
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,115
Oh, you can squeeze me in,
for old time's sake.

325
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:33,075
And what makes you think I want
a disruptive old queen like you

326
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:34,955
anywhere near my film?

327
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:39,395
I've given up the booze.
Really?

328
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:41,075
Smell my breath.
I'd rather not.

329
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:42,955
I need this.

330
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:46,635
Oh, what the hell.

331
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:51,435
We go back a long way, don't we?
Oh, thanks, Nick.

332
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,075
Show him where wardrobe is.
He can be the cart driver.

333
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:57,355
Reload! Reload, please! Are you
offering me work as an extra?

334
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:59,275
Take it or leave it.

335
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:03,835
OK.

336
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:07,435
And if you so much as look...
at a bottle of booze...

337
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:14,515
Can we do that again?

338
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:18,115
And this time, if it's not too much
trouble, can you get the timing
right?

339
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,675
First positions, please!

340
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:30,635
Raymond? Oh!

341
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:32,795
Is that you?

342
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:35,035
In the flesh!

343
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:38,035
Come here, you!

344
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:40,595
Oh! What a wonderful, wonderful
surprise.

345
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:44,355
I don't know about you,
but a Christmas card every year
hasn't been enough.

346
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:47,555
I wanted to see what you looked like
after 17 years.

347
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:50,275
Well, you haven't changed.
Gwen!

348
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:53,075
Oh, all right.
A bit frayed round the edges.

349
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:56,675
But the car's still immaculate.
Well, of course. I cherish her.

350
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,795
If there was but one room
at the Inn,

351
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,555
I'd gladly stay out in the cold and
let her have shelter for the night.

352
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,635
You might have to.

353
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,755
Hello, Raymond.

354
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:10,035
Neville.
The Magna Hotel's full to bursting.

355
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:12,915
I take it you are staying?
I am.

356
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:16,235
I saw that they were shooting this
film in your neck of the woods

357
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:20,075
and thought it would be the ideal
opportunity to catch up with you.

358
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:22,395
I didn't realise
we'd all be working on it.

359
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:25,075
You've got a part?
Sort of.

360
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:27,955
Must dash. Have to get changed.

361
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:34,755
Raymond. That's for the extras.

362
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,835
I know.

363
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:39,195
Hasn't that made your day?

364
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:45,675
Working as an extra? God,
that must be so humiliating for him.

365
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,115
And in a film directed by
Nick Cheyney.

366
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:54,955
All aristos and peasants
back on set in 15 minutes!

367
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:57,035
All right!
15 minutes, all right?

368
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,555
What the hell's he still doing
in your life?

369
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,275
I always sign our Christmas cards
from both of us.

370
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,235
You knew he was still living
with me.

371
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,995
But why? You don't owe him anything.

372
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:09,915
Ted's dead.
You're under no obligation

373
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,675
to look after his brother.
I know that.

374
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:16,475
So why would you want
your brother-in-law
lurking about the place?

375
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:19,115
Particularly when you're...
well, you know.

376
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:22,435
What?
Trying to entertain.

377
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,515
Do you mean sex?

378
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,195
Yes.

379
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:30,875
It must be hard enough to come by
in a dead and alive hole like this.

380
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,275
Oh, I've lost interest in all that.
You?

381
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:35,115
I don't believe it!

382
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:38,115
You go without something long
enough, you get used to it.

383
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:40,675
Then we'll have to get you
unused to it.

384
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:44,315
Oh, yeah? And what are you going to
do about it, you old poof?

385
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:46,995
Oooh! That's my Gwen!

386
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,715
CHATTER

387
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,635
You look as though you need that.

388
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,435
Well, I know how Sisyphus felt.

389
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:15,275
Is that a medical complaint?

390
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:17,315
Character in Greek mythology.

391
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,355
Had to push a boulder up a hill.

392
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:22,195
Couldn't relax or it would roll back
and crush him.

393
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:25,555
I'll keep 'em coming, then.
Nah, I've gotta go to the Manor.

394
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:28,635
Dinner with the producer.
Oh. You likely to be late?

395
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,555
I hope not. Why?

396
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:33,235
Well, I'll wait up.
We can sink a few then.

397
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:35,715
Good man. Well, I'll drink to that.

398
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:39,915
Oh, I was er...just saying.

399
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,875
Drink later on, when you get back
from dinner?

400
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,195
Oh, I thought you meant
just the two of us.

401
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:47,755
Oh, I...
Very nice of you to include me.

402
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:52,195
Don't worry Nick, I've got other
plans. I'm sure you have.

403
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:09,835
Can I help you, sir?
You certainly can.

404
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:14,795
I have spent the last 30 years
coming out of the closet,

405
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:17,275
and you have put me back into one.

406
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,475
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

407
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:21,795
I want a bigger room.

408
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:25,395
Taxi for Mr Cheyney. Through there,
to the left, peasants' bar.

409
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,835
I'll check on the computer.

410
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:35,075
All right?

411
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,915
Have you ridden with this guy
before? No. Why?

412
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:47,915
From the look he was giving you,

413
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,835
I assumed you'd forgotten
to tip him.

414
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:57,955
Oh, no, my darling. Leave it,
please. Well, it's me or Danny.

415
00:26:57,955 --> 00:27:00,115
Well, does it have to be
either of you, just now?

416
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:01,995
He's got to be confronted.

417
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,955
So, I was thinking as an added
attraction for the great unwashed

418
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:12,835
we might open the place
to the public while you're filming.

419
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:15,595
I can't have the public around
while I'm trying to work.

420
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:19,475
Then get your arse into gear. You're
a jobbing director, not Fellini.

421
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:22,155
We can't afford to finance
your fantasies.

422
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:28,915
Leonie.
Ah, your gorgeous daughter!

423
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:34,075
Leonie, please.
This is a business meeting.

424
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:36,395
It's neither the time nor the place.

425
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:38,555
It's always about what you want,
isn't it?

426
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,755
Must never jeopardise the deal.

427
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:43,275
Diane, see our daughter out,
will you?

428
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:47,275
I'm sorry? You seem to have mistaken
me for one of the hired help.

429
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:49,435
Besides, I don't think she's ready
to go yet.

430
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,315
Oh, I am!

431
00:27:54,955 --> 00:27:59,435
Don't you even think about
coming anywhere near me or my child.

432
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:01,315
MY child.

433
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,315
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Am I being threatened?

434
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:10,835
Yes. You are.

435
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:30,675
I seem to have lost my appetite.
Yeah, well, I'll come with you.

436
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,555
You're the reason I'm leaving.

437
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:37,275
Sorry, Nick. Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

438
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,755
Hands off my grandson, Nick,
or I'll see you dead.

439
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:04,075
VEHICLE APPROACHES

440
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:15,035
ENGINE STOPS AND DOORS OPEN

441
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,755
DISTANT RAISED VOICES

442
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:32,555
I promised Leonie
I'd stay out of this,

443
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:34,795
but if you go anywhere near her
or Josh...

444
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:38,435
Good God! Even the taxi driver's
threatening me now.

445
00:29:38,435 --> 00:29:40,315
Is the whole bloody village
in on this?

446
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:42,195
No. Just me.

447
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:46,755
And just what has it got to do
with you?

448
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:49,195
I'm Leonie's partner.
Partner?!

449
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:52,955
(LAUGHS) How PC!

450
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:55,475
Well, partner or not,

451
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:58,755
you have no rights
where Josh is concerned, but I have.

452
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,755
So if I choose to get closer
to my son...

453
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:06,355
..there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

454
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,235
Oh, there is!

455
00:30:09,595 --> 00:30:11,475
VAN DOOR SLAMS AND ENGINE STARTS

456
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,235
(CRIES OUT)

457
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:47,415
Hi, George.

458
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,415
What have you got here?

459
00:31:49,415 --> 00:31:52,935
Dead five or six hours. Cause of
death, head separated from the body.

460
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:55,695
Now, that's where we benefit from
having an expert on the job.

461
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:57,775
That's enough from you.

462
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,655
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

463
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:04,055
It's Nick Cheyney.
The film's director.

464
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,975
You know him?

465
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,015
I saw him yesterday.
When he was in one piece.

466
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:14,415
Well, we don't have to look far
for the murder weapon.

467
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:16,695
If it was murder.
Really?

468
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,895
There's no sign of a struggle

469
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,975
and only Mr Cheyney and Mr Braxton
held keys to the safety lock.

470
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:26,335
You think it could be suicide?
Except there's no sign of his key.

471
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,655
Who found him?
The security guard.

472
00:32:32,655 --> 00:32:34,535
Jed Norris.

473
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:41,535
I spoke to him. Mr Cheyney.
He came looking for me.

474
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:44,735
What for?
Wanted me to get lost for an hour.

475
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,655
I have to say, I didn't expect
to see him again last night.

476
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,335
Again?
Yeah.

477
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,775
He'd been to dinner at the Manor.
Big bust up.

478
00:32:51,775 --> 00:32:53,815
I could hear them arguing
from outside

479
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:56,695
and the looks they were giving him
when he left. Who?

480
00:32:56,695 --> 00:32:58,855
Mr and Mrs Charteris,
their daughter,

481
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:00,935
Mr Braxton... Even the cab driver.

482
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:05,655
Was he alone on the set
when you saw him? Oh, yeah.

483
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:08,415
That's what made it all
a bit creepy. In what way?

484
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:10,415
He was so drunk
he was barely conscious.

485
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:13,975
So someone drove him there.
I never heard him arrive.

486
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:16,655
I mean, car, dead of night.
You'd hear it.

487
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:18,055
But I didn't.

488
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:22,175
Here, listen,
could I have a strong coffee?

489
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:24,295
This place is giving me the creeps.

490
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,455
Turning sensitive in your old age,
Jed?

491
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:29,575
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right,
don't worry about me.

492
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:32,295
I'm only the one who found
the head in the basket.

493
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:34,215
Did you find it?
You know I did.

494
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,775
Or did you put it there?
No, no, no, no, no, no!

495
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:38,815
I'm not having that.

496
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:41,815
I mean, I might have a bit of form
but I'm not a violent man.

497
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:44,815
Check my record.
We know your record, Jed.

498
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,375
What about George Ince?

499
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,775
Ince was nowhere near this place
last night.

500
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:52,375
Far as I know.

501
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:57,255
All right, Jed,
go get yourself that coffee. Thanks.

502
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,735
What about Ince? He's a violent man.

503
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:11,255
Yeah, but he's a robber
first and foremost.

504
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:13,815
And if Cheyney had disturbed him
during a break-in,

505
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:16,135
he would have attacked him
without a thought.

506
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:18,415
But he wouldn't have had to chop
his head off.

507
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:22,815
You know, Jones,
under the circumstances,

508
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:25,615
this is not an ideal interview room.

509
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:36,855
Who was at the dinner party
last night?

510
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,295
It was a working dinner.
Just the three of us.

511
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:41,815
The three of you?
Me, Nick and Jack Braxton.

512
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:44,255
Mrs Charteris, you weren't there?

513
00:34:44,255 --> 00:34:46,735
No, no. It was a business meeting.

514
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:49,975
Although she did make an entrance
with our charming daughter.

515
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:52,895
Leonie turned up unexpectedly.
She left early.

516
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:54,815
After doing her best
to ruin the evening.

517
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:57,015
Why would she want to do that?

518
00:34:57,015 --> 00:35:00,495
Because she's my daughter. Do you
have children, Chief Inspector?

519
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:02,255
How can you even ask that?

520
00:35:02,255 --> 00:35:05,575
Do you know, you and Nick Cheyney
are two of a kind.

521
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:08,215
What's that supposed to mean?
You're both...

522
00:35:08,215 --> 00:35:10,615
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
..lousy fathers!

523
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:13,215
Jones?
Oh, steady on, Sergeant.

524
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:18,575
That's a high-quality piece of
furniture you're knocking about
there. Priceless, in fact.

525
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,455
Sorry. It was a wrong number.

526
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:25,455
I understand you're planning to open
the Manor as a heritage site, sir?

527
00:35:25,455 --> 00:35:29,135
That's right. Turns out the old
place is groaning with history.

528
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:32,255
Priceless, eh? Yeah, well,
not literally, but pretty close.

529
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,855
Certainly irreplaceable.
Mr Charteris...

530
00:35:34,855 --> 00:35:37,015
did Braxton and Cheyney leave
together?

531
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:40,855
No, they left separately. They don't
have much time for one another.

532
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:43,055
And what state was Mr Cheyney in
when he left?

533
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:48,215
Well, he'd had a drink.
What does that mean, precisely?

534
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:50,975
It means he was drunk.
And objectionably so.

535
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:53,695
That's Nick.
As though that makes it acceptable.

536
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:59,695
Look...I suppose there's no way of
stopping this, Chief Inspector?

537
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:02,135
I'm sorry?
All the negative publicity.

538
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:05,535
Oh, that is not my department,
I'm afraid.

539
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:09,255
Mrs Charteris, what did you do
after Mr Cheyney left?

540
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:13,055
I had an early night.
(SNORTS)

541
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:26,775
Jones, what was all that
about the furniture?

542
00:36:26,775 --> 00:36:29,175
We are investigating
a suspicious death

543
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:31,815
and you're going on about
a flaming cupboard.

544
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,815
Because it was a fake.
How do you know?

545
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,815
My grandad was a cabinet maker.

546
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:38,215
He was a what?
He was a master cabinet maker.

547
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:40,335
So he'd know all about
dodgy cupboards?

548
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:43,535
All I'm saying is that cupboard
was far from irreplaceable.

549
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,135
Ironic, isn't it?

550
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:53,135
An every-expense-spared production
and the cheap old prop

551
00:36:53,135 --> 00:36:56,255
we had made up to look like
a guillotine actually works.

552
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,255
But you want to know if you can
carry on filming, yeah?

553
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:02,175
I was thinking more along the lines
of when.

554
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:04,895
How're you gonna find a new director
at such short notice?

555
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:07,015
On our budget, we won't!

556
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:09,215
Although Cheyney wasn't being paid,

557
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:12,255
his indulgent style of shooting
was costing us a fortune.

558
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:15,055
Not being paid? He was on
a profit-sharing agreement.

559
00:37:15,055 --> 00:37:18,975
That's how desperate we both were.
No, I will take over as director.

560
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,335
Will you? You seem very pleased
at the prospect.

561
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:25,375
Mr Braxton, is there someone
who can confirm where you were

562
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:28,615
at the time of Nick Cheyney's death,
like Mrs Charteris?

563
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:31,735
What are you implying?
Mrs Charteris - she called us out

564
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:34,255
a couple of nights ago
to investigate a prowler.

565
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:36,855
She said she was just about
to go to bed. So?

566
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:40,455
Well, her husband was out.
Your car was at the front door.

567
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,375
OK.

568
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,655
Diane Charteris and I
spent last night together too.

569
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:51,255
So you are each other's alibis
for the time of Nick Cheyney's death?

570
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:54,495
Mm.
Thank you.

571
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:58,055
You can carry on filming.
But only because I want to keep
everyone together

572
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:01,095
for the sake of this investigation.
Thank you, Mr Braxton.

Freddie.

575
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:16,655
Morning, sir.

576
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:19,335
Nick Cheyney.
He was staying here, wasn't he?

577
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:23,215
That's right. I heard him come back
last night. Only he didn't.

578
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:26,975
I'm sorry, you've lost me.

579
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:29,335
He'd been for dinner at the Manor.

580
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:32,655
We'd arranged to have a drink
when he got back.

581
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:35,095
Well, I heard Danny's taxi pull up
outside.

582
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:37,055
Danny? Who's Danny?
Danny Twyman.

583
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:39,215
He's a nice lad.
Runs a local minibus.

584
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,535
And you recognised his voice.
Yeah.

585
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:43,975
They were having an argument.
About what?

586
00:38:43,975 --> 00:38:46,855
I couldn't hear.
Didn't last long, though.

587
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:50,535
Danny drove off and I was expecting
Cheyney to come into the hotel.

588
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:54,095
He didn't.

589
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:56,775
What do you think happened to him?
We know what happened.

590
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:58,735
We're trying to work out why.

591

(WOMAN SNIFFS AND SOBS)

592
00:39:05,935 --> 00:39:07,855
We knew him
when he first started out.

593
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:11,135
He was a louse even then.

594
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:15,015
What a waste of life.

595
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:17,535
What a wicked waste of life.

596
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:20,535
Fortunately his own, this time.

drop him off last night?

599
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:47,415
Outside the Midsomer Magna Hotel.

600
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:50,655
We have a witness
who heard raised voices.

601
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,455
We had a row over the fare.

602
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:56,055
Asked if I took credit cards. As if!

603
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:58,335
So you didn't drive him
to the film set?

604
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:00,695
No way. He'd already had one ride
for free.

605
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:04,895
See anyone else while you were
driving around the Manor?

606
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:06,695
Only Jed Norris hanging around.

607
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:10,255
How long have you known
Miss Charteris?

608
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:13,935
We were students together,
on a drama course in London.

609
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:16,135
Before she was pregnant?

610
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:18,935
I'm not Josh's dad,
if that's what you're asking.

611
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:24,455
I'd like to be. That's why I
followed her back to Midsomer Magna.

612
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,135
To help her make the break.
The break from what?

613
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:32,735
Her dad. Lets her live here
rent-free but he's a control freak.

614
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:35,375
Is that what she argued with him
about last night?

615
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,375
Or had she gone there to confront
Nick Cheyney?

616
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:41,975
Well, she didn't like the man.
Well, neither does her mother.

617
00:40:41,975 --> 00:40:47,175
Is that because Nick Cheyney
is the father of Leonie's child?

618
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:51,735
Yes. Yes, he was.

619
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:54,655
So they were in a relationship?

620
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:58,335
He came to our college
as a visiting lecturer.

621
00:40:58,335 --> 00:41:01,095
The only relationship they had
was the sort that happens

622
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:03,415
after a 50p-a-pint night
in the student bar.

623
00:41:07,655 --> 00:41:10,375
You come and give your Auntie Gwen
a big cuddle.

624
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,815
Gwen, you ought to go home.
I can manage here.

625
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:15,295
Are you sure?
Cos I really do feel dreadful.

626
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:17,455
It's fine. Really.

627
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:19,055
Good morning.
Tom.

628
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:21,255
Gwen.

629
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:23,215
Miss Charteris.
You've come to see me?

630
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:26,415
Yes, yes, we have.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby

631
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:29,215
and this is Detective Sergeant Jones
from Causton CID.

632
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:33,455
Miss Charteris, I understand that
you were at a dinner

633
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:36,855
with Mr Nick Cheyney last night
and you had an argument.

634
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:39,575
A blazing row would be
more accurate.

635
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:42,135
Look, Danny's phoned me.
Has he?

636
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:44,175
Then he will have told you
that we know

637
00:41:44,175 --> 00:41:46,615
that Nick Cheyney was Josh's father?

638
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:48,815
What? Oh, God!

639
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:51,535
Are you OK?
No, I'm all right. Please.

640
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:53,935
No. I'm fine, I'm fine.

641
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,455
Gwen was just about to go home,
actually.

642
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:59,855
Nick's death has really upset her.

643
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,175
Err, Miss Charteris, can we, er...

644
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:06,015
Erm, yes, of course.

645
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:10,095
How did your parents react
when you became pregnant?

646
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:14,855
Oh, my dad had a top man lined up
in Harley Street.

647
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:18,735
Which you obviously resisted.
You bet.

648
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:20,975
And where was Mr Cheyney
in all of this?

649
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:23,975
Making the arrangements.
How did you know?

650
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,255
That's the sort of thing
Nick would've done.

651
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:29,135
Of course, you knew him, didn't you?

652
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:33,255
So your parents were aware
that Cheyney was Josh's father?

653
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:35,455
Oh, yeah.

654
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:38,535
What bugs me is how easily
Dad dismisses what Nick did to me.

655
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:44,295
It may not have been rape but...
he took advantage.

656
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:49,255
And did he acknowledge that
he was the father of your child?

657
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:51,975
Barely, and that suited me fine.

658
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,695
Until he arrived here and started
talking about getting to know Josh.

659
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:58,815
He could've been winding me up.

660
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,535
But I wasn't taking any chances.

661
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:05,615
By luring him to the guillotine
and chopping his head off?

662
00:43:07,495 --> 00:43:09,415
Do I look like a murderer?

663
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:23,375
Yes and er...Lady Arabella,
her name was.

664
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,575
Fine looking woman.
Beautiful.

665
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:29,375
Yes, distinct likeness,
if I may say so.

666
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:32,215
Mind out, sir.
I know, you were asking about...

667
00:43:32,215 --> 00:43:35,455
This apparently is the only chalk
farm - Mr Charteris.

668
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:37,535
Oh. I've got a couple of questions
for you.

669
00:43:45,695 --> 00:43:48,335
Why didn't you tell us about
the argument you had

670
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,615
at your dinner party
the other evening?

671
00:43:50,615 --> 00:43:52,975
It was just Leonie
being bloody with Nick.

672
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:56,735
The father of her son.
Oh, you know about that now, do you?

673
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:59,135
Single mother against the world.

674
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:01,775
Hardly a single mother -
she's in a relationship.

675
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:05,375
Oh, is that what you call it?
You don't approve of Danny Twyman?

676
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:09,015
Are you serious? Went against the
grain hiring him for the evening,

677
00:44:09,015 --> 00:44:11,135
but he's the only taxi in the area.

678
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,895
You hired him?

679
00:44:12,895 --> 00:44:16,415
Yeah, paid him on account to pick
Nick up and drop him back off again.

680
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:23,575
You must have had a very complicated
relationship with Nick Cheyney.

681
00:44:23,575 --> 00:44:26,375
I've known Nick for years,
Chief Inspector.

682
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:29,415
And you knew about his affair
with your daughter?

683
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:32,215
Yes.

684
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:35,615
And you still felt able to entertain
him to dinner under your roof?

685
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:37,535
That was purely business.

686
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,895
And you weren't in favour of
Nick Cheyney

687
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:43,015
being involved in
your grandson's life?

688
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:46,335
I'd have made sure it didn't happen.

689
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,455
How would you have done that?

690
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:52,215
Not by killing him, Chief Inspector.

691
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:54,975
But I would have stopped him.

692
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:03,855
How long had you known Nick Cheyney?

693
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,615
We worked on some films together.

694
00:45:07,615 --> 00:45:09,855
Yeah, we looked him up
on the database.

695
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:12,055
Apparently he made
a few box office hits.

696
00:45:12,055 --> 00:45:15,895
Oh, he'd known what it was like
to work with big names, big budgets.

697
00:45:15,895 --> 00:45:17,975
I suppose you can understand him

698
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:20,175
becoming a bit resentful
in later life.

699
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,055
Gwen, stop defending the man.
Nobody ever liked him.

700
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:24,935
That's not true.

701
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:28,655
We worked with lots of other
directors besides Nick.

702
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:31,055
In the business we were known as
the Four Musketeers.

703
00:45:31,055 --> 00:45:33,295
Me, Neville, Raymond and Ted.

704
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,695
Ted?
My late husband.

705
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:37,855
Neville's brother.

706
00:45:37,855 --> 00:45:40,895
He died just before we moved
to Midsomer Magna.

707
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:46,055
No children? Does that question have
any relevance?

708
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:48,335
Well, I won't know
until you answer it, Gwen.

709
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:53,095
No. No children.

710
00:45:54,695 --> 00:45:58,295
Background artists for scene 53,
back on set now, please!

711
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:02,575
Gwen?

712
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:05,855
Er, yes, off you go, thank you.

713
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:16,455
Touched a nerve there.
I thought I might.

714
00:46:20,775 --> 00:46:23,615
Last time I saw Nick,
as he was leaving for dinner.

715
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:27,335
I was in reception trying to get
moved from my shoebox of a room.

716
00:46:27,335 --> 00:46:30,935
And where were you after that?
In bed. Exhausted and defeated.

717
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:32,855
You didn't like Nick Cheyney,
did you?

718
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:35,975
No, and I did briefly entertain
the notion of trying to kill him

719
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:39,375
to get a bigger room, but I thought
that was a touch excessive.

720
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:43,375
Did you have any other reason
for wanting him dead?

721
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:46,695
Believe me, having to spend
the night in that single bed
was reason enough.

722
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:54,695
Thank you. Keep the change.

723
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:01,295
Psst! Psst!

724
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:04,095
Chief Inspector.
Yes?

725
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:06,215
I've been waiting to speak to you.

726
00:47:06,215 --> 00:47:09,775
Why didn't you come through
to the bar? I could hardly do that.

727
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:12,575
It was Raymond Clandillon
I wanted to tell you about.

728
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:16,895
You do know they hated one another,
him and Nick Cheyney?

729
00:47:16,895 --> 00:47:18,975
Well, he didn't put it
as strongly as that.

730
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:21,375
And I bet he didn't tell you why.

731
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:24,575
Nick Cheyney sacked him from a film
they were working on.

732
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:29,295
So he had a reason.
But Cheyney didn't leave it at that.

733
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:32,295
Bad-mouthed him
all around the industry.

734
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:34,895
Tipped Raymond's career
into free-fall.

735
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:38,015
Did he?
Well, thank you, thank you for that.

736
00:47:38,015 --> 00:47:40,815
Just thought you'd like to know.
Yes, thank you.

737
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,359
Right, going for a take!

738
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,559
Going for a take!
Standing by for a take!

739
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,719
Turn over!
Speed!

740
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:53,679
Sound rolling!
Mark it!

741
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,479
168, take 7.
Stand by...

742
00:47:57,479 --> 00:47:59,159
and...action!

743
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:14,159
HALF-HEARTED CHEERING

744
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,439
Cut!
Cut!

745
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,079
I would like to try and clarify
something.

746
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,519
You are downtrodden peasants.

747
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:30,679
And these people... See?

748
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:33,679
These people have ground you
into the earth.

749
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,799
They've exploited you
all your lives.

750
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:37,759
You hate them with a passion.

751
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:40,479
And now it is payback time.

752
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:44,639
So when you hear the blade
slice through their necks,

753
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,439
I want you to try and imagine
your feelings of joyful revenge,

754
00:48:49,439 --> 00:48:52,039
and let me hear it!

755
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:54,279
Right?
MURMURING

756
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,639
OK, reset, everybody!

757
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,599
Ronnie, how long with the blood?
Ten minutes.

758
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,439
Make it five!

759
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:11,799
Raymond Clandillon
was no fan of Nick Cheyney.

760
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:13,999
Neither was Neville Hayward.

761
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:18,079
And Jack Braxton's almost joyful
at getting rid of him from the film.

762
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,519
Diane Charteris loathed him.

763
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,719
Not sure about the husband, though.

764
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,599
Hurry up with that blood!

765
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:31,559
Gwen, you shouldn't be doing this.
You're still in shock.

766
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:33,479
Take it up!

767
00:49:33,479 --> 00:49:35,319
I've always been a professional,
Joyce.

768
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,959
I hope I still am.

769
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:42,199
Then, of course,
there's Danny Twyman.

770
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:44,279
He admits having a row
with Nick Cheyney,

771
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:46,239
but he lied about the reason,
didn't he?

772
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,159
It couldn't have been over the fare

773
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,239
because that had already been paid
for by Terence Charteris.

774
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:54,519
So why should we believe that he
didn't take Cheyney to the film set?

775
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,679
Hello. What's going on over there?

776
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,879
Someone find me the unit nurse,
please.

777
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:06,079
(SNIFFS) It's not booze.

778
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,239
Neville!

779
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,039
It's worth checking,
given his track record.

780
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,439
Raymond?
What's going on?

781
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,039
How are you feeling?
I'm fine now.

782
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:19,759
Are you sure?
Yeah.

783
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:21,879
High blood pressure.

784
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,079
Happens from time to time.

785
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:31,039
Tell me. Why are you prepared
to work as an extra?

786
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,079
Got to do something
to pay the bills.

787
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:35,079
No, I mean on this particular film.

788
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:37,719
With a director who did his best
to ruin your career?

789
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:41,159
Cheyney only helped me on my way.

790
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:43,799
I was already well down that slope.

791
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:46,519
So you didn't bear him a grudge?
Of course I did.

792
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:49,439
That's exactly why I wanted to get
on this film.

793
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:52,599
You came to kill him.
I came to gloat.

794
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:54,559
Sorry, I'm not following that.

795
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,399
Look, I may be just an extra
in a rubbish movie,

796
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:59,839
but Nick was actually directing it.

797
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,599
And for him that was a living death.

798
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:17,279
Mr Braxton? I'm sorry.

799
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,719
Her head won't be underneath the
blade when it falls, will it?

800
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,599
No. Let me show you.

801
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,519
Can you demonstrate
the blade safety?

802
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:37,399
Satisfied?
Ah, yes.

803
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:40,239
But that guillotine remains under
guard at all times

804
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,959
and you retain the key, OK?
Fine.

805
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,319
Is it absolutely necessary for him
to be here while we're filming?

806
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,359
Well, I can have him removed,

807
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:54,039
but we'll have to shut down your
film set. If he goes, everybody goes.

808
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,799
Right, let's do this!

809
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,359
Quiet, please! Going for a take!

810
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:01,999
Quiet, please!
Stand by!

811
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:03,799
Turnover!
Running!

812
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:05,719
End board!

813
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,679
Stand by!

814
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:11,519
And action!

815
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,159
Takes some guts to put your head
where Cheyney lost his.

816
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,039
There's more to Gwen Morrison
than meets the eye.

817
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,479
Let's hope it stays that way.
Quiet, everyone!

818
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:33,919
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

819
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:38,799
Cut!
Cut!

820
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:40,679
MOBILE CONTINUES RINGING

821
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:46,839
Whose mobile is that?

822
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,319
TURNS MOBILE OFF
Sorry!

823
00:52:58,799 --> 00:53:00,759
Beautiful.

824
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:09,559
Feeling better?
Much.

825
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:11,959
But you look as though
you could do with cheering up.

826
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,839
I'm all right. I've got Josh.

827
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,719
Cute little fellow but he belongs
with his mum.

828
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:20,879
He's the last thing you need
right now, and you know it.

829
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:24,559
So what do you suggest?
A spin in my beast.

830
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,279
It'll put the glow back
in your cheeks again.

831
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:30,199
But I can't, I've got to wait for
the old people.

832
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,439
They can manage without you.
Now, come on, come on.

833
00:53:33,439 --> 00:53:36,239
We'll go for a trip down
memory lane. Oh, stop it!

834
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:39,959
That argument you had
with Nick Cheyney,

835
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:41,999
It was nothing to do with
that taxi fare.

836
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:43,719
You were angrier than that.
Was I?

837
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:46,679
Yes. Nick Cheyney was trying to get
involved in Josh's life.

838
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:48,639
You couldn't let that happen.

839
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,559
I don't know why you were worried.

840
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,359
Leonie wasn't about to push you out
in favour of Nick Cheyney.

841
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,399
Although, successful film director,
cab driver... Given the choice...

842
00:53:57,399 --> 00:54:00,639
Yes, and after all,
Nick Cheyney was the real father.

843
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,519
The best thing Nick ever did for
Josh was stay away from him.

844
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,479
Real father?

845
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:09,359
I'm the only father Josh
has ever known and that's the way
it's going to stay!

846
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,679
That's Ince!

847
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:26,359
With Charteris.

848
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:29,999
Yeah. I doubt they're talking
rare antiques.

849
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,719
Remember this? You and Ted
in the back, me at the wheel,

850
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,079
and Neville chewing his nails
down to his elbows.

851
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,799
You did drive a bit recklessly.
With gay abandon!

852
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:43,679
Reckless abandon.

853
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:47,559
Happy days!

854
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,519
Then why the tears?

855
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:54,199
You know why.

856
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,679
Gwen, it's over.

857
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:01,879
A long time ago.

858
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:14,439
We've found traces of Oramorph
in Cheyney's body.

859
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:17,519
What's Oramorph?
Morphine based, colourless.

860
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,239
It's a controlled drug,
issued on prescription.

861
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:23,359
Usually to terminal cancer patients
to ease their pain.

862
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,999
Any sign of cancer in Cheyney?
None at all.

863
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:28,759
So what is the significance of this?

864
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,079
Combined with alcohol, and there was
plenty of that in his system,

865
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,439
Oramorph would have caused Cheyney
to pass out.

866
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:37,519
So the likelihood is that Cheyney
was unconscious

867
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,359
before the blade fell.
I'd have thought so.

868
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:43,479
Which tells us -
That someone else was involved

869
00:55:43,479 --> 00:55:46,079
and that this is now
a murder investigation.

870
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:54,279
Now what?

871
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,639
Sit yourself down, Jed.

872
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:03,399
I want you to know why you're
employed here as a security guard.

873
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:07,359
It's obvious. This place is
stacked out with valuable stuff.

874
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,239
Some of the pictures alone
are worth millions.

875
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,639
Who told you that?
Charteris or Ince?

876
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,559
I don't know what you mean.

877
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,159
They're in it together, Jed,
and you are being taken for a mug.

878
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,679
There's nothing in this place
worth more than a few quid.

879
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,159
It's all fake.
It's an insurance scam, Jed.

880
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,319
Once your friend Ince has cleared
this place out,

881
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:33,199
who d'you think I'll be looking for
as the inside man who let him in, eh?

882
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,559
With your record,
it'll be open and shut.

883
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,159
Charteris and Ince
know that you are no grass.

884
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:40,759
They're relying on it.
It'll be a long sentence too.

885
00:56:40,759 --> 00:56:44,679
Yes, indeed it will. Especially
if he's involved with a murderer.

886
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:46,559
Murderer?

887
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,159
Oh, I needed that.
Oh, you've earned those, gentlemen.

888
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,039
LAUGHTER

889
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,359
Careful, careful, careful.
Here comes the constabulary.

890
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,359
Being a bit loud, were we?

891
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:08,759
No, of course you weren't.
May we join you?

892
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,479
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

893
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:14,319
You're looking in better spirits.

894
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,199
We were remembering one of Nick's
films that we worked on.

895
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:22,399
That's me, Neville, Raymond
and er...that's Ted.

896
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:25,319
Oh, thank you.
Oh, the Four Musketeers.

897
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,319
That was a long time ago.

898
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:30,039
I can tell that by the togas
you're all wearing.

899
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:33,439
That was on the set of The Cross And
The Sword. A Biblical epic.

900
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:37,119
They were slaves.
I was an army commander.
I was actually on a horse.

901
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,519
Raymond was an actor back then.

902
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,039
Proper parts.
I was, yes.

903
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,559
You can look me up in Who's This?
of show business.

904
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,039
Well, you're an extra
with the rest of us now.

905
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:52,039
And it's the drink which has
brought me this far down
the evolutionary scale, Your Honour.

906
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:55,679
Shame it wasn't a solo trip.
Neville!

907
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:00,079
But no, you had to drag Ted along
for the ride.

908
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,559
Neville, that's not what happened.
Oh, for pity's sake, Gwen.

909
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:06,399
Your husband, my brother,
drank himself to death

910
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,039
and he was always there
to buy the next round.

911
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:12,919
I'm going home.

912
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:14,839
Sorry.

913
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,639
'Scuse me!
Hey!

914
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:20,559
Thank you!

915
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:26,039
Thank you.
Er, that's mine.

916
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:28,679
Oh, I thought you were gonna let me
keep it.

917
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,599
Sorry, darling.
Aw!

918
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:32,479
It's the only one I have of Ted.

919
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:08,757
"You wish once more to see me
a love-sick supplicant at your feet,

920
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:11,437
so that you can have the pleasure
of kicking me aside

921
00:59:11,437 --> 00:59:13,637
like a troublesome lapdog?"

922
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:16,917
It's not working.
It's only a run-through.

923
00:59:16,917 --> 00:59:19,597
He's doing his best.
He's too wooden.

924
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,357
He is supposed to be wooden.

925
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:26,157
He's a stiff-arsed aristocrat
who can't express his true feelings.

926
00:59:26,157 --> 00:59:28,357
My husband!

927
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:31,557
A man who loves me with a passion
underneath all that.

928
00:59:31,557 --> 00:59:33,677
But he can't bring himself
to tell you.

929
00:59:33,677 --> 00:59:35,637
That is the whole point
of the scene.

930
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:37,517
(EXASPERATED GROAN)

931
00:59:46,277 --> 00:59:48,477
Let's take a break.
Reload!

932
00:59:53,117 --> 00:59:55,037
DIALS NUMBER ON MOBILE PHONE

933
00:59:59,317 --> 01:00:01,357
Neville Hayward resents the time

934
01:00:01,357 --> 01:00:04,637
Clandillon spent drinking with
his brother Ted, doesn't he?

935
01:00:04,637 --> 01:00:07,317
Yeah, but Gwen didn't seem bothered
by it, did she?

936
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:09,757
And Ted was Gwen's husband.

937
01:00:09,757 --> 01:00:12,997
So maybe Neville was jealous?
Maybe he fancied Clandillon.

938
01:00:12,997 --> 01:00:15,117
Unrequited love and all that.

939
01:00:15,117 --> 01:00:17,757
Do you think Neville's gay?

940
01:00:17,757 --> 01:00:22,077
Well, he's never married.
He's lived with his sister-in-law
most of his adult life.

941
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,037
I'm not so sure about that.

942
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:29,477
Problem, Mr Braxton?
Oh, just the usual.

943
01:00:30,437 --> 01:00:33,237
Why don't you get someone else
to read the scene with her?

944
01:00:33,237 --> 01:00:35,637
Any suggestions?

945
01:00:35,637 --> 01:00:37,517
Yeah, Neville Hayward.

946
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:40,517
Who? Neville Hayward.
There, talking to her now.

947
01:00:42,317 --> 01:00:44,477
An extra? He'll be no better.

948
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:47,197
She doesn't want someone
who's better, Mr Braxton.

949
01:00:47,197 --> 01:00:50,677
She wants some acknowledgement
of the tantrum she's just thrown.

950
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:55,197
You're right.

951
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:57,317
Might be worth a try.

952
01:00:57,317 --> 01:00:59,357
And you'd be doing me a favour,
thank you.

953
01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:02,877
Stand by! Stand by!

954
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:26,397
Right, we're getting there. Let's go
once more from the top of the scene.

955
01:01:26,397 --> 01:01:29,877
And...action!

956
01:01:31,277 --> 01:01:33,517
You required my presence, madam?

957
01:01:33,517 --> 01:01:36,437
I assume that it was not
with a view to...

958
01:01:36,437 --> 01:01:38,917
indulging in tender reminiscences.

959
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:41,077
Why not?

960
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:43,997
The present is not so glorious
but that I should wish

961
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:46,117
to dwell a little in the past.

962
01:01:47,157 --> 01:01:49,597
Is it possible that love can die?

963
01:01:49,597 --> 01:01:51,237
Good, good.

964
01:01:51,237 --> 01:01:53,397
But you're ferociously proud,

965
01:01:53,397 --> 01:01:57,037
and you're determined to get him to
express his true feelings for you.

966
01:01:58,997 --> 01:02:01,197
I thought the passion you felt
for me

967
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:03,517
would outlast the span
of human life.

968
01:02:08,837 --> 01:02:12,917
You wish once more to see me
a love-sick supplicant at your feet,

969
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:15,917
so that you may have the pleasure
of kicking me aside

970
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,837
like a troublesome lapdog?

971
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:19,877
I entreat you...

972
01:02:19,877 --> 01:02:22,597
can we not bury the past?

973
01:02:24,357 --> 01:02:27,797
But I understood you to say that it
was your desire to dwell in it.

974
01:02:27,797 --> 01:02:29,677
And tears, tears.

975
01:02:33,157 --> 01:02:35,157
Since it distresses you...

976
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:37,117
we will speak no more of it.

977
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:41,837
Unable to express his feelings
he turns and leaves.

978
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:46,157
And that is where we're gonna cut.
That's absolutely wonderful!

979
01:02:46,157 --> 01:02:47,797
Are you happy?

980
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,797
Right, well, all we need now

981
01:02:49,797 --> 01:02:52,997
is for Sir Percy to grace us
with his presence and we're away.

982
01:02:52,997 --> 01:02:54,917
Jack, have you got a minute?

983
01:02:59,717 --> 01:03:01,797
Neville.

984
01:03:01,797 --> 01:03:04,717
That was very good, that. Very good.

985
01:03:04,717 --> 01:03:07,237
And very revealing.

986
01:03:08,357 --> 01:03:10,237
What do you mean?

987
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:12,477
Gwen Morrison's interest
in children?

988
01:03:12,477 --> 01:03:14,597
Why did she never have any children
of her own?

989
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:18,437
It's a touchy subject.

990
01:03:18,437 --> 01:03:20,677
They were desperate
to have a family.

991
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:22,837
Her and my brother, Ted.

992
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:24,597
But they never did.

993
01:03:26,117 --> 01:03:28,237
Oh, well, they tried.

994
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,517
Three miscarriages, Gwen suffered.

995
01:03:30,517 --> 01:03:32,557
And what effect
did that have on Ted?

996
01:03:32,557 --> 01:03:34,557
He was devastated.

997
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:37,717
Turned to drink. Slow suicide.

998
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:40,277
With Raymond Clandillon for company.

999
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:47,637
When Ted died,
I did what I could for Gwen...

1000
01:03:49,077 --> 01:03:51,277
..but I can never forgive Raymond.

1001
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:53,197
That was good of you though,
wasn't it,

1002
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,797
you know, to stay around
and pick up the pieces?

1003
01:03:57,197 --> 01:03:59,117
I did it for my brother.

1004
01:04:00,157 --> 01:04:02,077
Almost taking his place.

1005
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,597
Up to a point.
Oh, yes, up to a point.

1006
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:08,517
It's not as though you and Gwen
were husband and wife.

1007
01:04:24,717 --> 01:04:27,997
Sergeant. We've just been talking
to Neville Hayward.

1008
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,237
That sounds ominous.

1009
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:32,197
What's he been telling you?

1010
01:04:45,957 --> 01:04:50,637
Gwen, I was very interested in
your attitude towards children,

1011
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:54,157
and Neville told me about
your three miscarriages.

1012
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:56,317
He had no right.

1013
01:04:56,317 --> 01:05:00,397
Was your husband, was Ted, the
father in all three pregnancies?

1014
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,597
Or am I right in thinking that,
in one case,

1015
01:05:02,597 --> 01:05:04,477
the father was Nick Cheyney?

1016
01:05:05,797 --> 01:05:08,877
This is none of your business.
I'm sorry but I think it is.

1017
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:11,357
I am trying to find out who killed
Nick Cheyney.

1018
01:05:11,357 --> 01:05:14,997
Since I believe he was the father of
one of your unborn children,

1019
01:05:14,997 --> 01:05:17,077
it's very much part of
my investigation.

1020
01:05:19,557 --> 01:05:22,917
Where's all this come from?
From your behaviour with Josh

1021
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:26,957
in the charity shop, when you found
out that Nick Cheyney was his father.

1022
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:30,077
..that we know that Nick Cheyney
was Josh's father?

1023
01:05:30,077 --> 01:05:31,237
Oh, God!

1024
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:35,077
She was just about to go home,
actually.

1025
01:05:35,077 --> 01:05:37,477
Nick's death has really upset her.

1026
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:41,877
I couldn't believe
that I was holding Nick's son

1027
01:05:41,877 --> 01:05:44,797
after I'd killed our own.

1028
01:05:46,997 --> 01:05:49,317
I so wanted to have that child.

1029
01:05:49,317 --> 01:05:53,117
But...I couldn't do it to Ted.

1030
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:55,237
Not after what we'd been through

1031
01:05:55,237 --> 01:05:58,997
and so I let him think that
I'd had a miscarriage.

1032
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:02,357
What about Cheyney?

1033
01:06:02,357 --> 01:06:04,837
He, erm...made all the arrangements.

1034
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:07,237
He was...good at that sort of thing.

1035
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:11,037
Gwen, did you kill him?

1036
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:29,557
"They seek him here,
they seek him there."

1037
01:06:32,397 --> 01:06:34,357
And now I've found him.

1038
01:06:35,397 --> 01:06:38,677
What the hell are you doing?
I thought somewhere private.

1039
01:06:38,677 --> 01:06:44,597
Somewhere suitably murky...
for a grubby little revelation.

1040
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,477
Are you raving?
I know your secret.

1041
01:06:49,477 --> 01:06:51,757
You're mad!
And you do have a secret, don't you?

1042
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,077
I know, because I have it...

1043
01:06:56,317 --> 01:06:58,517
..right here.

1044
01:06:58,517 --> 01:07:00,677
You killed Ted.
No.

1045
01:07:00,677 --> 01:07:02,637
Your own brother.

1046
01:07:02,637 --> 01:07:04,957
Just because he was married to Gwen.

1047
01:07:04,957 --> 01:07:06,837
Is that what it was with Cheyney?

1048
01:07:08,117 --> 01:07:10,197
Was he too close to her
for your liking?

1049
01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:16,237
GWEN: Leave the village? Why?

1050
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:18,357
You can see the way
Barnaby's thinking.

1051
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:20,517
That we're in this together.

1052
01:07:20,517 --> 01:07:24,197
That we've exacted some kind of
revenge on Nick Cheyney.

1053
01:07:24,197 --> 01:07:26,277
And why would he think that?

1054
01:07:26,277 --> 01:07:28,837
Because he knows
Cheyney wrecked your life.

1055
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:31,037
So trust me, please.

1056
01:07:31,037 --> 01:07:33,997
We have to leave this village
if we want to be together.

1057
01:07:33,997 --> 01:07:36,157
We are together.

1058
01:07:38,397 --> 01:07:40,597
You know what I mean.

1059
01:07:40,597 --> 01:07:42,997
Neville, I don't want to talk
about this.

1060
01:07:42,997 --> 01:07:46,317
No. I'm not allowed to mention
the way I really feel.

1061
01:07:46,317 --> 01:07:49,557
Talk about that love
that dare not speak its name.

1062
01:07:49,557 --> 01:07:51,437
Now you're being histrionic.

1063
01:07:51,437 --> 01:07:54,757
You can give yourself to a callous
bastard like Nick Cheyney...

1064
01:07:54,757 --> 01:07:57,157
Stop it!
Where did I go wrong?

1065
01:07:58,477 --> 01:08:01,037
Made the mistake of actually caring
for you,

1066
01:08:01,037 --> 01:08:05,117
instead of treating you the way
every other man in your life did,
except Ted.

1067
01:08:05,117 --> 01:08:07,997
How many times did you expect him
to look the other way?

1068
01:08:09,637 --> 01:08:11,597
He never knew.

1069
01:08:11,597 --> 01:08:14,037
In our business? Impossible.

1070
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,797
You must have known
you were destroying him.

1071
01:08:17,797 --> 01:08:20,317
But you kept on playing the part.

1072
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,517
"Poor Gwen, she was so in love
with Ted."

1073
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:28,277
Must have been to put up with
that brother of his all these years.

1074
01:08:28,277 --> 01:08:32,117
I know why you've put up with me.
And it's never gonna happen.

1075
01:08:32,117 --> 01:08:35,677
And if you can no longer accept
that, then you'd better leave.

1076
01:08:35,677 --> 01:08:37,437
Now!

1077
01:08:37,437 --> 01:08:39,357
MAN: Tom, you got five?

1078
01:08:50,397 --> 01:08:52,277
Oh, Raymond. It's you.

1079
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:57,557
Not still down in the dumps?

1080
01:08:58,437 --> 01:09:00,757
I've just had a terrible row
with Neville.

1081
01:09:00,757 --> 01:09:02,877
Well, that's not difficult. Here.

1082
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:04,757
Have a few swigs of this.

1083
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:09,757
I thought you'd stopped drinking.
I have.

1084
01:09:09,757 --> 01:09:11,837
But I'm like an old Saint Bernard

1085
01:09:11,837 --> 01:09:13,837
bringing succour to those
that need it.

1086
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:26,197
So, you'll be on until two o'clock
and then...

1087
01:09:38,077 --> 01:09:41,077
You haven't seen Gwen, have you?
No, not for a while.

1088
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,517
But she wasn't feeling too good
earlier on.

1089
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:45,757
She might have gone home
with Neville, then.

1090
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:47,877
More than likely.

1091
01:09:47,877 --> 01:09:50,637

Bloody but unbowed.

1096
01:11:13,677 --> 01:11:16,317
In fact, not even bloody.

1097
01:11:16,317 --> 01:11:18,717
What happened?
Had one of my turns.

1098
01:11:18,717 --> 01:11:20,597
Came off the road.

1099
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,877
Still feel a bit groggy.
Right, I'll call for help.

1100
01:11:24,877 --> 01:11:26,837
Thanks. Mine's in the car.

1101
01:11:28,957 --> 01:11:32,237
Where are you going?
I forgot to turn the engine off.

1102
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:34,557
No, wait a minute. You wait there.
I'll do that.

1103
01:11:48,157 --> 01:11:50,917
Right, rescue vehicle's on its way.

1104
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:53,357
Now, come on, Raymond.
Let's get you to A&E.

1105
01:11:53,357 --> 01:11:55,477
Oh, there's no need for that.

1106
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,517
Yes, there is.
Come on, no arguments.

1107
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:59,437
You've gotta be checked out.
Come on.

1108
01:12:01,637 --> 01:12:03,997
Uh, tell me.

1109
01:12:03,997 --> 01:12:07,917
You and Gwen Morrison...
Why do you get on so well?

1110
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:12,117
I suppose it's because we both
once cared for the same man.

1111
01:13:11,837 --> 01:13:15,437
I thought you were supposed to be
going out at eight.
It's nearly nine.

1112
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:18,237
It's a girls' night out.
It's nothing to do with you.

1113
01:13:18,237 --> 01:13:21,877
Let's drop the pretence.
You're spending the night
with Jack Braxton.

1114
01:13:21,877 --> 01:13:25,597
Of course. I'm simply keeping up
the facade of civilised duplicity.

01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:35,277
Just because I used Cheyney
for my business,

1118
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,997
don't think that made me despise him
any the less,

1119
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,477
or myself for having anything to do
with him.

1120
01:13:40,477 --> 01:13:42,597
Why are you telling me this?

1121
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:44,837
Did you kill Nick?

1122
01:13:47,237 --> 01:13:49,277
I'm just saying...

1123
01:13:49,277 --> 01:13:51,517
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

1124
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:56,597

A special drink for a special lady.

01:15:56,797 --> 01:15:59,237
OK, don't move! That's enough Ince!

1136
01:16:00,677 --> 01:16:01,957
Cuff him!

1137
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:08,557
I mean, I love the idea but,
does it have to be the Sixties?

1138
01:16:08,557 --> 01:16:10,517
It makes it much more expensive.

1139
01:16:10,517 --> 01:16:13,517
I know but we've got it down to
about three million dollars.

1140
01:16:13,517 --> 01:16:16,757
We've got a production company
in Maryland... Mr Charteris.

1141
01:16:16,757 --> 01:16:18,757
Oh. Chief Inspector.

1142
01:16:18,757 --> 01:16:22,277
There's been an attempted robbery
up at the Manor.

1143
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,277
Terry.

1144
01:16:24,277 --> 01:16:26,917
Uh...attempted?

1145
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:29,077
Yes, sir, attempted.

1146
01:16:29,077 --> 01:16:31,317
Fortunately, we caught them
in the act.

1147
01:16:34,277 --> 01:16:36,237
You don't seem very pleased, sir?

01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,557
I was going to give you a ring, Jed,

1151
01:17:32,557 --> 01:17:35,237
but I thought you'd prefer to hear
the news in person.

1152
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:40,117
All rounded up. Didn't have to use
the thumbscrews on Mr Ince.

1153
01:17:40,117 --> 01:17:42,437
He's already given us Charteris's
name.

1154
01:17:42,437 --> 01:17:46,237
And yours. Just as well you decided
to change sides, eh?

1155
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:48,477
So a big thank you.

1156
01:17:48,477 --> 01:17:52,357
By the way, somebody tried to break
into the props store earlier.

1157
01:17:52,357 --> 01:17:55,277
But we didn't find anyone.
We?

1158
01:17:55,277 --> 01:17:57,877
Me and your PC,
guarding the guillotine.

1159

Oh, my...
Gwen.

1163
01:18:43,303 --> 01:18:46,063
There's no sign of Neville
and his car's missing.

1164
01:18:46,063 --> 01:18:48,023
I've put out an APB.

1165
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:52,463
Ah! The law never sleeps, eh?

1166
01:18:53,743 --> 01:18:56,983
A bit early in the day
to come calling, though.

1167
01:18:56,983 --> 01:19:00,463
Could say the same for you. No car.
I've come to cadge a lift from Gwen.

1168
01:19:03,223 --> 01:19:05,423
What?

1169
01:19:05,423 --> 01:19:07,543
Gwen Morrison won't be going to work
today.

1170
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:10,263
(MOCK GASP) Full name?
That sounded official.

1171
01:19:10,263 --> 01:19:13,303
Gwen... Gwen's body was found
at the guillotine

1172
01:19:13,303 --> 01:19:15,183
in the early hours of this morning.

1173
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:19,263
Body?

1174
01:19:19,263 --> 01:19:21,143
She's been beheaded.

1175
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:38,663
I keep trying to picture it
and block it out of my mind
at the same time.

1176
01:19:40,223 --> 01:19:42,143
Oh, God.

1177
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:46,103
How's Neville taking it?

1178
01:19:46,103 --> 01:19:48,143
Well, we'll know that
when we find him.

1179
01:19:48,143 --> 01:19:50,183
Gone missing?
It appears so, yes.

1180
01:19:50,183 --> 01:19:52,703
Well, does that mean...?
Does it mean what?

1181
01:19:52,703 --> 01:19:54,943
Well, Gwen dead.
Neville gone missing...

1182
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:01,343
Do you think it's likely
that Neville would have harmed her?

1183
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:05,303
Gwen? No, no. He'd love to get me
under that blade, but Gwen, never!

1184
01:20:05,303 --> 01:20:07,743
There's no love lost
between you two, is there?

1185
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:12,463
I'm afraid I might be partly
responsible...

1186
01:20:13,903 --> 01:20:16,103
..for him disappearing.
What's this?

1187
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,303
An anonymous letter.

1188
01:20:18,303 --> 01:20:20,623
Well, it was sent to Ted
anonymously, anyway.

1189
01:20:21,823 --> 01:20:24,183
Telling him about his wife
and Nick Cheyney.

1190
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:28,143
Did Ted know
who was responsible for this?

1191
01:20:28,143 --> 01:20:31,223
No but it had to be from somebody
wanting the marriage to break up.

1192
01:20:32,463 --> 01:20:35,583
Someone who was willing to spend
15 years of his life with Gwen

1193
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:38,223
without ever letting
his true feelings show?

1194
01:20:38,223 --> 01:20:40,503
That's why you're
the Chief Inspector.

1195
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:42,983
Took me years to work that out.

1196
01:20:42,983 --> 01:20:45,183
What did you do with it?

1197
01:20:45,183 --> 01:20:47,863
Oh, I confronted him with it
yesterday.

1198
01:20:47,863 --> 01:20:50,063
A grubby little revelation.

1199
01:20:50,063 --> 01:20:52,303
He was a snivelling wreck.

1200
01:20:52,303 --> 01:20:54,223
Because I have it...

1201
01:20:55,863 --> 01:20:58,063
right here.

1202
01:20:58,063 --> 01:21:00,543
'Especially when I threatened to
show it to Gwen.'

1203
01:21:00,543 --> 01:21:02,423
And what would that achieve?

1204
01:21:03,743 --> 01:21:08,183
It was a bluff.
I wouldn't have done that to her.

1205
01:21:08,183 --> 01:21:10,423
But Neville didn't know
you were bluffing.

1206
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,583
No.

1207
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:16,143
I thought he deserved to sweat.

1208
01:21:28,023 --> 01:21:32,143
You know, Raymond, if Neville felt
that strongly about Gwen,

1209
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:35,423
it must have been hard for him
just living with her as a friend.

1210
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:40,103
Torture. But you'd be surprised
how little someone will settle for
when they're in love.

1211
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,223
Mr Braxton...

1212
01:21:42,223 --> 01:21:44,383
You know why I'm here.

1213
01:21:44,383 --> 01:21:46,823
You're closing us down.
That is correct.

1214
01:21:46,823 --> 01:21:49,863
Before you make the announcement,
may I just say a few words?

1215
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,703
Make it brief.

1216
01:21:52,863 --> 01:21:54,743
Ladies and gentlemen.

1217
01:21:55,983 --> 01:21:57,983
Could I have your attention, please?

1218
01:21:59,063 --> 01:22:01,343
Quiet, please!
We're going for a take!

1219
01:22:01,343 --> 01:22:03,383
Quiet, please!
Quiet, please!

1220
01:22:04,743 --> 01:22:08,623
Thank you. Erm...I just wanted to
say a few words about Gwen.

1221
01:22:11,303 --> 01:22:14,663
Most of us knew her
in some capacity or other.

1222
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:18,783
The people of the village remember
a compassionate and caring woman.

1223
01:22:18,783 --> 01:22:21,823
The more venerable among us
in the acting profession

1224
01:22:21,823 --> 01:22:23,983
knew that side of her too,

1225
01:22:23,983 --> 01:22:27,503
but we also remember a performer
who was game for anything.

1226
01:22:29,303 --> 01:22:32,903
Who can forget the leather bikini,
the whip and the stuffed swan?

1227
01:22:34,463 --> 01:22:36,383
The Lovely Leida.

1228
01:22:37,063 --> 01:22:40,663
Well, the point is Gwen was
a very special person,

1229
01:22:40,663 --> 01:22:43,583
and however we choose
to remember her,

1230
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:45,983
we should do our best
to keep that memory alive.

1231
01:22:47,343 --> 01:22:49,263
Thank you.

1232
01:22:51,543 --> 01:22:53,503
"The Lovely Leida"?

1233
01:22:54,743 --> 01:22:58,463
There was a side to Gwen
that you knew nothing about
in Midsomer Magna.

1234
01:23:07,063 --> 01:23:09,223
So Gwen hadn't returned home

1235
01:23:09,223 --> 01:23:12,143
by the time you left the house
yesterday evening, right?

1236
01:23:12,143 --> 01:23:14,023
I didn't expect her to.

1237
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:17,223
Why is that?

1238
01:23:17,223 --> 01:23:20,343
I thought she was deliberately
staying away till I'd gone.

1239
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:24,063
Had she asked you to leave?

1240
01:23:27,383 --> 01:23:29,303
Where did you plan to go?

1241
01:23:30,343 --> 01:23:32,263
Plan?

1242
01:23:33,943 --> 01:23:35,863
Do I look as though I had a plan?

1243
01:23:41,943 --> 01:23:45,663
You know, everything points to
Neville Hayward, sir.

1244
01:23:45,663 --> 01:23:48,663
Except for the fact that we picked
him up at a 24-hour diner

1245
01:23:48,663 --> 01:23:52,223
and the staff say he'd been sitting
there since yesterday evening.

1246
01:23:52,223 --> 01:23:55,023
All during the time Gwen Morrison
was guillotined.

1247
01:23:55,023 --> 01:23:56,823
So we let him go?

1248
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,823
Yes, well,
we've got no choice, have we?

1249
01:24:00,783 --> 01:24:03,223
Tell him not to leave the house
without notifying us.

1250
01:24:07,423 --> 01:24:10,103
DS Jones. Yeah.

1251
01:24:10,103 --> 01:24:12,983
Take Neville Hayward home, please.
Thanks.

1252
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:31,703
On my way home, Tom.
George.

1253
01:24:32,423 --> 01:24:35,663
But...we found traces of Oramorph
in Gwen Morrison's body.

1254
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:37,463
Did you?

1255
01:24:37,463 --> 01:24:40,063
Enough to render her unconscious
before she was killed?

1256
01:24:40,063 --> 01:24:43,023
Definitely.
So they were both unconscious

1257
01:24:43,023 --> 01:24:46,463
by the time the killer laid them
under the blade of the guillotine.

1258
01:24:46,463 --> 01:24:49,543
That's why there was no sign of a
struggle from either her or Cheyney.

1259
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:51,663
I still don't see how it's possible

1260
01:24:51,663 --> 01:24:53,943
to get them there without being seen
or heard.

1261
01:24:53,943 --> 01:24:55,903
No, me neither. Especially Gwen.

1262
01:24:55,903 --> 01:24:59,343
I mean, OK, the killer broke into
the props store as a diversion

1263
01:24:59,343 --> 01:25:02,303
but that wouldn't have given him
the time he needed, would it? No.

1264
01:25:03,423 --> 01:25:04,703
Unless...

1265
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:15,703
Unless the body was already
at the guillotine.

1266
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:20,423
The cart full of headless dummies.

1267
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:23,263
Sir?
Headless dummies, Jones.

1268
01:25:23,263 --> 01:25:26,103
He should have been driving them
away from the guillotine,

1269
01:25:26,103 --> 01:25:27,823
not towards it! George...

1270
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:31,943
Come back, I want you to be part of
this. The Oramorph.

1271
01:25:31,943 --> 01:25:34,663
you said it was available
on prescription, yes?

1272
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:38,023
At any high street chemist.
Or hospital pharmacy.

1273
01:25:38,023 --> 01:25:40,303
That's how he knew where it was.

1274
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:43,623
Raymond, let's get you to A&E.
Oh, there's no need for that.

1275
01:25:43,623 --> 01:25:45,903
Oh, yes, there is.
Come on, no arguments.

1276
01:25:45,903 --> 01:25:48,503
When I drove him to the hospital
there were roadworks.

1277
01:25:48,503 --> 01:25:51,143
There were diversions,
but he knew the way round them.

1278
01:25:51,143 --> 01:25:53,543
Because he'd been there before.

1279
01:25:53,543 --> 01:25:55,543
Is he suffering from
terminal cancer?

1280
01:25:57,503 --> 01:26:00,943
Any way of confirming that, George?
A post mortem.

1281
01:26:00,943 --> 01:26:03,503
Well, use your clout
with the hospital.

1282
01:26:03,503 --> 01:26:06,983
Not in my remit.
Thank you, George. Thank you.

1283
01:26:14,063 --> 01:26:16,263
I don't any more, as you know.

1284
01:26:16,263 --> 01:26:19,063
But I thought you might like
a little pick-me-up.

1285
01:26:19,063 --> 01:26:20,823
Oh.

1286
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:25,103
You suspected, didn't you, that
Neville was in love with Raymond

1287
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:27,823
and jealous of him spending so much
time with Ted.

1288
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:31,503
That's when I thought Neville was
gay, but he isn't. But Raymond is!

1289
01:26:31,503 --> 01:26:34,863
What if, during the many hours he
spent consoling Ted

1290
01:26:34,863 --> 01:26:38,223
in the various pubs and bars,
Raymond fell in love with him?

1291
01:26:38,223 --> 01:26:40,263
Without Ted realising?

1292
01:26:40,263 --> 01:26:43,023
And when Ted died of the booze
and the broken heart,

1293
01:26:43,023 --> 01:26:45,183
caused by Gwen and Cheyney,

1294
01:26:45,183 --> 01:26:48,343
then Raymond would have been
devastated and very angry.

1295
01:26:48,343 --> 01:26:50,623
But why wait 15 years
to take your revenge?

1296
01:26:51,503 --> 01:26:54,463
He's dying.
He's got nothing left to lose.

1297
01:26:54,463 --> 01:26:56,663
He's settling old scores.

1298
01:26:58,143 --> 01:26:59,743
And his car...

1299
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:05,183
I didn't realise
it was still running.

1300
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:08,423
His engine was still running...
but I couldn't hear it.

1301
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:11,903
It explains why Freddie Greenaway
didn't hear a second car engine

1302
01:27:11,903 --> 01:27:14,943
outside the hotel the night of
Cheyney's murder, doesn't it?

1303
01:27:14,943 --> 01:27:17,703
Clandillon took Cheyney to the film
set in his car.

1304
01:27:17,703 --> 01:27:19,863
If he was in love with Ted,

1305
01:27:19,863 --> 01:27:22,263
he'd have a reason
to kill Cheyney and Gwen.

1306
01:27:22,263 --> 01:27:24,663
And Neville Hayward...

1307
01:27:24,663 --> 01:27:27,183
for sending Ted that letter.

1308
01:27:29,543 --> 01:27:31,463
DOORBELL

1309
01:27:43,183 --> 01:27:45,183
No sign of movement, sir.

1310
01:27:45,183 --> 01:27:47,103
Film set.

1311
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,543
(RAYMOND GROANS)

1312
01:27:57,383 --> 01:27:59,063
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS

1313
01:28:04,183 --> 01:28:06,103
Chief Inspector.

1314
01:28:06,943 --> 01:28:09,463
I must applaud your sense
of the dramatic.

1315
01:28:09,463 --> 01:28:13,463
Unfortunately, your timing's
just a little bit out.

1316
01:28:13,463 --> 01:28:15,503
There is no point in this.

1317
01:28:15,503 --> 01:28:17,383
Oh, I think there is.

1318
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:21,743
I'm not prepared to let the people
responsible for Ted's death...

1319
01:28:21,743 --> 01:28:23,543
go unpunished.

1320
01:28:23,543 --> 01:28:27,103
But you've already done what
you've set out to do, haven't you?

1321
01:28:27,103 --> 01:28:30,183
You came to Midsomer to catch up
with Nick Cheyney

1322
01:28:30,183 --> 01:28:31,903
and you've done that.

1323
01:28:31,903 --> 01:28:35,543
And having Gwen here made it so much
easier to lure him to his fate.

1324
01:28:40,223 --> 01:28:42,463
'You waited outside the hotel

1325
01:28:42,463 --> 01:28:45,103
for him to get back from his dinner
at the Manor.

1326
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:47,623
And you knew he'd be drunk,
didn't you?

1327
01:28:47,623 --> 01:28:50,943
And then what? I suppose you told
him that Gwen wanted to see him?'

1328
01:28:50,943 --> 01:28:54,023
'Given the history between them,
I knew he'd be curious.'

1329
01:28:54,023 --> 01:28:56,903
(LAUGHS) Top quality malt.

1330
01:28:59,143 --> 01:29:01,263
I knew it!
I knew you were still drinking.

1331
01:29:02,623 --> 01:29:06,343
I suppose you know this means
you're fired. Finish it off.

1332
01:29:06,343 --> 01:29:08,303
'The whisky was spiked with
Oramorph.'

1333
01:29:08,303 --> 01:29:10,383
You have been doing your homework.

1334
01:29:11,663 --> 01:29:15,423
And then what? I suppose you parked
a little way away from the film set

1335
01:29:15,423 --> 01:29:18,223
and advised Cheyney
to get rid of the security guard

1336
01:29:18,223 --> 01:29:20,543
so his meeting with Gwen
wouldn't be seen.

1337
01:29:20,543 --> 01:29:24,143
It's as though you were there.
You're dying, Raymond.

1338
01:29:24,143 --> 01:29:26,143
Why would you be bothered about
being caught?

1339
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:28,223
Well, I wasn't.

1340
01:29:29,143 --> 01:29:32,903
And there was still Gwen and Neville
to be taken care of.

1341
01:29:32,903 --> 01:29:36,383
Raymond... Cheyney I can understand.
Neville, yes, maybe.

1342
01:29:36,383 --> 01:29:38,543
But Gwen? I mean, why Gwen?

1343
01:29:38,543 --> 01:29:41,063
Surely Gwen was the...chief victim?

1344
01:29:41,063 --> 01:29:43,263
Victim?!

1345
01:29:43,263 --> 01:29:47,783
Gwen was a more than willing partner
in their squalid little affair.

1346
01:29:47,783 --> 01:29:51,423
So in your eyes
she was as guilty as Cheyney.

1347
01:29:51,423 --> 01:29:53,303
More so.

1348
01:29:55,663 --> 01:29:57,703
Oh, Raymond. It's you.

1349
01:29:57,703 --> 01:30:00,143
'I bided my time.

1350
01:30:00,143 --> 01:30:02,903
Gave her a few swigs
from my hip flask.

1351
01:30:02,903 --> 01:30:04,783
Specially prepared.'

1352
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:08,103
'Whisky and Oramorph.'

1353
01:30:14,303 --> 01:30:18,463
Do you know, Raymond?
You are doing him a great favour.

1354
01:30:21,823 --> 01:30:23,863
You think so?
Yes, I do.

1355
01:30:25,143 --> 01:30:28,823
He wouldn't want to wake up to
the memories he'd have to live with.

1356
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:30,943
CRUNCH
Don't come any closer, Sergeant.

1357
01:30:32,943 --> 01:30:35,103
(MOUTHS)

1358
01:30:35,103 --> 01:30:39,183
A rather squalid attempt at
reverse psychology, Chief Inspector.

1359
01:30:41,143 --> 01:30:43,103
But it's worked.

1360
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:48,463
He'd much prefer oblivion...
to a living hell.

1361
01:30:50,663 --> 01:30:52,623
Here.

1362
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:56,183
You want this.

1363
01:30:58,783 --> 01:31:00,703
No, not really.

1364
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:03,623
I had that lock changed.

1365
01:31:05,823 --> 01:31:07,863
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1366
01:31:07,863 --> 01:31:10,623
And I made the noble gesture.

1367
01:31:10,623 --> 01:31:14,103
Appropriate, really...
the Scarlet Pimpernel.

1368
01:31:15,743 --> 01:31:19,503
"It's a far, far better thing
I do..."

1369
01:31:19,503 --> 01:31:21,903
That's A Tale Of Two Cities.
Is it?

1370
01:31:24,863 --> 01:31:27,023
Typical of my life.

1371
01:31:29,303 --> 01:31:31,663
I'm in someone else's story again.

1372
01:31:46,863 --> 01:31:50,103
By the way, thanks for telling me
about changing the lock.

1373
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:52,423
Oh, sorry.
I was sweating cobs back there.

1374
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:54,743
Yeah, sorry.
It was a last-minute decision.

1375
01:31:54,743 --> 01:31:57,503
Oh, it's just as well.
He was going for the hat trick.

1376
01:31:57,503 --> 01:32:00,063
I mean Cheyney, Neville,
I can understand.

1377
01:32:00,063 --> 01:32:02,783
But I had no idea how he really felt
