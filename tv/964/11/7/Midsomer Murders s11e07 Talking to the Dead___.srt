1
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:43,530
Hello?

2
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:52,759
Hello?

3
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:02,787
Stan?

4
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,593
Nesta?

5
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:01,431
Thank you.

6
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:45,003
Well, it's blood, alright.
Whether it's human is another matter.

7
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:49,761
- And this is how it was found?
- Yeah, same as the other cottage

8
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,583
Breakfast on the table,
tea still warm.

9
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,422
Kettle on the hob.
No sign of the occupants.

10
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,514
If that is not human blood, George,
what is it?

11
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:02,444
Four people live in these cottages
and no sign of any of them.

12
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,572
I'll get the lab to run a check.

13
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:06,156
And the postman called us in?

14
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,255
- Noticed the blood stain, apparently.
- Yeah, where is he?

15
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,925
On his rounds,
as far as we know.

16
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:13,128
That big house we passed
on the way here.

17
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,700
- The priory?
- Yeah. See if there's anyone in.

18
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,101
So, George. In this cottage we got
Nesta and Stanley Goodfellow.

19
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:21,960
What about the other?

20
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,901
The Thomases.
Molly and Colin.

21
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:24,970
Did you know them?

22
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:28,327
I did the post mortem on
their 10-year-old son Peter.

23
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:31,243
He ran away from home
after an argument.

24
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,762
Found wandering in Monksbarton
Woods for a couple of days.

25
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:35,969
He was alive when they found him
but he died soon after.

26
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,077
Suspicious death?

27
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:39,763
No, no, no. He died of
hypothermia.

28
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:42,523
When they found Peter,
he was jibbering.

29
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:43,907
No one could understand him.

30
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:46,158
The locals had it that
he was speaking in tongues.

31
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,307
Isn't there some kind of mystery
surrounding Monksbarton Woods?

32
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:52,410
Well, I don't know any
details, Tom.

33
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:55,295
The man you want's
Wallace Stone, local historian.

34
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,807
He's the vicar over at
Beau Clayton.

35
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:00,353
Bit of a hellfire and
damnation man, too.

36
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:00,353


37
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,812
{\2c&H0000FF&}Water stains?
It could be.

38
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:05,613
{\2c&H0000FF&}Dunno.
Ask Forensics to pay us a visit.

39
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:05,613


40
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:07,427
I made some enquiries, though.

41
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:09,562
It's owned by a Lynton Pargeter.

42
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,016
He lives in London,
but the place has been

43
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,140
in the family for as long as
anyone can remember.

44
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:14,159
Who lives there now?

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,778
He does.
Last of the Pargeters.

46
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,743
It's a big place for a
weekend retreat, isn't it?

47
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:19,089
- Not if you're rich.
- Is he?

48
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,589
Well, I looked through the window,
the place is stuffed with antiques.

49
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,463
Right. Check his details.
Give him a ring.

50
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,859
You drive. Drop me off at
Beau Clayton vicarage.

51
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,699
I want to talk to a
Reverend Stone.

52
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:33,088
Monksbarton Woods... er...
haunted, apparently.

53
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:35,128
By what?

54
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:38,415
The ghosts of monks, Mr Barnaby.

55
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:42,025
Men of the cloth who
died violent deaths.

56
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,349
There was once a thriving
religious community

57
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,396
in Monksbarton.

58
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,889
The abbey was destroyed during
the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

59
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,682
And the priory is
all that's left?

60
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:56,462
When the soldiers arrived,
the monks fled into the woods...

61
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,341
they were hunted down
and slaughtered.

62
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:03,923
Local legend says their death cries
can sometimes still be heard.

63
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:08,194
This village is obsessed
by Monksbarton legends.

64
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,827
We're plagued by ghost hunters,
fanatics and freaks.

65
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:15,771
Half the village is among them.
I'm a man of God, Mr Barbaby.

66
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:18,872
There's no place for superstition
in my religion.

67
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:20,091
Sarah!

68
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:23,151
Could you tell me, please,
about Peter Thomas.

69
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,075
The boy had a silly argument
with his mother,

70
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,814
ran away, got lost.

71
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,316
Died of exposure.
Sarah!

72
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:33,736
It was said that when he
was found he was... erm...

73
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:35,697
Speaking in tongues, yes.

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,760
Utter nonsense.

75
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:41,138
And near blasphemous
nonsense at that.

76
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,414
I preached a sermon against it.
Did you press my jacket?

77
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,992
Why was he not found sooner?

78
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,231
The woods must've
been his playground.

79
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,799
No, Colin and Molly Thomas lived
all their lives here in Beau Clayton.

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,038
They only moved to Monksbarton
after Peter died.

81
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,314
Molly got the idea
that she'd be nearer to her

82
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,836
dead son's spirit up there.

83
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:07,540
She thought she might be able to
get in touch, ask for forgiveness.

84
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,426
She had a breakdown.

85
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,234
She wasn't in her right mind.

86
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,170
Country people, Mr Barnaby.

87
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:20,327
Simple minds can be
easily ensnared...

88
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,342
by the talk of ghosts and ghouls
and the walking dead.

89
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:28,144
Frankly, I'd have preferred a
city parish, but it seems...

90
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:30,666
I'm not thought suitable.

91
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:33,668
Odd, don't you think?

92
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,571
To be spurned for the
strength of one's belief?

93
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,911
Did Molly Thomas
come to you for help?

94
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,720
No, she spoke to my wife,
for all the good it did.

95
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:48,434
Did you think that Mrs Thomas
was unbalanced?

96
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:51,452
Mrs Stone?

97
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,559
She was a woman in grief.

98
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,119
What do you know about
Monksbarton?

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,612
Monksbarton.

100
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:12,025
Apart from the two cottages
it's just the priory now.

101
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:14,719
With Stanley Goodfellow and
his wife to look after it.

102
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,761
Colin and Molly Thomas?

103
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:19,759
Colin's the manager of Benyon's
Woodyard in Beau Clayton.

104
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:23,021
After Peter died, Molly insisted
they move up to Monksbarton.

105
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,254
Did you know them?

106
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,429
I was part of the investigation
into the boy's death.

107
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,255
Molly was in a bad way.

108
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:34,082
So the Goodfellows are...
what, caretakers?

109
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,752
They manage the priory and
the woodland that surrounds it.

110
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:41,356
Stanley Goodfellow used to be a
gamekeeper up on the Farley estate.

111
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:43,680
So, a normal couple.

112
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,588
Nesta was know to be
a bit of a goer.

113
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,771
They say she had
a couple of affairs.

114
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:50,444
You know... just the usual.

115
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,345
Hello.

116
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,071
Yes. Just a moment.

117
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,875
- Can we pick this up later?
- Okay.

118
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:05,488
Drink after work?

119
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,229
Yeah, great.

120
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,868
Mr Pargeter...

121
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,787
Pargeter's on his way here?

122
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:13,992
He is.

123
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:17,570
Keys to the priory, just
where he said they'd be.

124
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:20,728
Where's the post?

125
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,350
Postman called this morning.

126
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,852
Where's the post?

127
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:29,158
Got scared and forgot
to leave it?

128
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,535
We'll ask him.

129
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,896
I'll check for return post.

130
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,912
Nice telly!

131
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:36,889
Plasma screen...

132
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:40,501
Every moment of footballing magic
in high definition.

133
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,905
- It's expensive?
- 15-hundred? Two grand?

134
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:47,015
Whew.
On a laborer's wage?

135
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:51,946
Forward!

136
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,198
Forward!

137
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,112
What?
You didn't hear it?

138
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:07,153
- It's a fox.
- Didn't sound like a fox to me.

139
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,752
Oh, all right.
It's the howl of a were-wolf,

140
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:12,113
ravening for blood.

141
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:15,713
Lucky I'm here
to protect you, then.

142
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:42,513
What's that?

143
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:47,752
Oh, that, Jones... is an iron maiden.

144
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,753
It's a medieval
instrument of torture.

145
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,752
Ooh!

146
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:01,473
A slow lingering death
in exquisite torment.

147
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:05,512
Different interrogation techniques
in those days.

148
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,352
All right. You take the rooms
upstairs. I'll look down here.

149
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:10,712
And make it quick. Chop, chop!

150
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,633
You don't expect to find them?
Not unless they're all dead.

151
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:20,513
Ooh! Yeah.

152
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,992
Jones?

153
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:39,273
Hello?

154
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,993
Jones, can you bring the keys?

155
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:38,673
Help!

156
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:50,832
You slammed the door.
Yeah. Any punctures?

157
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,232
No! You slammed the door.

158
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,713
No punctures?

159
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:58,272
No punctures?

160
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,992
Aah! That, Jones...

161
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:03,432
is because this version
of the iron maiden

162
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,832
uses a mechanical device

163
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,832
to do its work.

164
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,793
See?

165
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:17,752
Instead of being impaled immediately,

166
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:21,472
the victim would suffer
the slow advance

167
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,273
of the spikes.
It's neat.

168
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:28,153
Good job this IS the more
sophisticated version. Otherwise...

169
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,513
Got the keys?

170
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,433
Thank you. Come on.

171
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,312
Break in.
Yeah, seems so.

172
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:51,393
And take a look at this.

173
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:58,712
Something has taken the polish
off the table.

174
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:01,512
Water stains?
It could be.

175
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,312
Dunno.
Ask Forensics to pay us a visit.

176
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:05,952
Detective Sergeant Jones?

177
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,112
Lynton Pargeter.
We spoke on the phone.

178
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:11,633
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby.
Causton CID. Chief Inspector.

179
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:13,833
Oh, dear.

180
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:19,832
Did you do this?

181
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,673
No, sir, we did not.

182
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,192
You've had a break-in.
Perhaps you'd look around.

183
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,312
See if you've got anything missing.

184
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:29,073
Apart from my tenant workers

185
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:35,152
Just in time.
I got you a Chicken Jalfrezi.
Didn't have time to cook.

186
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:37,032
What?

187
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,712
Busy day, love?

188
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:43,032
Yes. I went to a fascinating talk
at Beau Clayton village hall.

189
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,393
Cyrus LeVanu.
Oh, for crying out loud.

190
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:49,272
He's a very interesting man.
He's not interesting.

191
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:52,072
He's a con, a charlatan, a phoney.
Have you seen his TV show?

192
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:54,712
Yes.
Well, it's... it's... it's laughable.

193
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:58,032
Isn't it? I mean, what does he
call himself? The ghostbuster

194
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:01,112
Ghost HUNTER. Ghost hunter.
You have a closed mind.

195
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:03,472
I do not have a closed mind.

196
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,272
I'm a copper.

197
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:07,913
I can spot a phoney a mile away
and LeVanu fits the bill exactly.

198
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:10,872
What's he doing in Causton?

199
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:13,872
The ghostly monks.
He's here for the anniversary.

200
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:15,712
What anniversary?

201
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,953
Of the massacre. It's tomorrow.

202
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:22,673
He's holding a ceremony
of spiritual healing in the woods.

203
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,913
Did I order that?

204
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,033
Unquiet spirits, speak to me.

205
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:01,033
I feel something.

206
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,273
Something tremulous in the ether.

207
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,753
Something that speaks of bloodshed
and darkness.

208
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,592
A spirit voice crying for help.

209
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:21,433
Oh, wonderful

210
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:29,672
We're in the company
of troubled souls.

211
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:32,072
Excuse me... Mr LeVanu.

212
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:34,952
Are you a seeker after truth?
No.

213
00:15:34,953 --> 00:15:37,112
Er, yes... Well, not en-

214
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:39,433
I am a police officer.

215
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:43,832
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby
from Causton CID.

216
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,112
And these woods, sir, are off limits.

217
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,232
Is this a crime scene?

218
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,672
Well, no.

219
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,752
It isn't.
Quite.

220
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:55,592
These woods are full of voices
of tormented souls, Mr Barnaby.

221
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:57,792
And I'm here to bring them peace.

222
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:00,312
With the express permission
of Mr Lynton Pargeter.

223
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:01,552
Pargeter?

224
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:04,112
Full... and express permission...

225
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,152
of Mr Pargeter.

226
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:07,833
Our mission begins.

227
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:11,193
Restless spirit, speak to me.

228
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,153
Unquiet spirit, speak to me.

229
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:47,672
My God!

230
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:49,393
What was that?

231
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:54,152
A spirit presence calling for help.

232
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,273
We must go deeper. Always deeper.

233
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,832
How long's he been dead?

234
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,952
Well, it's a shallow grave,
so some insulation.

235
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:23,072
Looking at the state of the body,

236
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:24,992
insect infestation and so on,

237
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:27,192
at least three days.

238
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,512
You must have known Colin Thomas.
Is this him?

239
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,952
No, I met Molly once,
but never Colin.

240
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:32,953
Ah!

241
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:36,912
Gail. Can you identify the body?
He'd be able to help.

242
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:39,273
What with being able to
talk to the dead

243
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:45,552
So. Is this Colin Thomas
or Stanley Goodfellow?

244
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:48,433
Neither of them.
I've never seen that man before.

245
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:50,913
I was drawn to him, Barnaby.

246
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,233
Called by the dead.

247
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:59,232
Erm, this officer
will take your statement,

248
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,592
Mr LeVanu - then you can go.

249
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:03,792
Go?

250
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:06,833
Go where? It must be plain to you
that I'm needed here.

251
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,473
I'm blessed with a great gift.

252
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:20,392
So, this man
isn't one of my tenants.

253
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,392
No, we don't know who he is yet.

254
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:25,432
We'll be asking you to view the body
in case you can identify him.

255
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,392
Me? Why would I know him?
Just for elimination purposes.

256
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:30,312
Excuse me.
Yes, Gail.

257
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:32,193
Mr Pargeter.

258
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:38,752
I understand that you've given Cyrus
LeVanu full access to the woods.

259
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:40,352
Yes, I have.

260
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,953
Well, it's making my job
very difficult, sir.

261
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:46,832
You know some people think
that Mr LeVanu is a charlatan?

262
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,792
A fraud?

263
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,393
Do you share their view?

264
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,712
On the contrary.

265
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,753
I think Cyrus LeVanu
is a gifted psychic.

266
00:19:56,913 --> 00:20:00,072
If the troubled souls
of those who were murdered

267
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,192
still wander these woods,
perhaps LeVanu

268
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:05,633
might find a way
of bringing them... rest.

269
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:09,512
My granny used to read tea leaves.

270
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,352
She saw a ghost once.
It walked through the wall.

271
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,792
Why don't they use the doors,
like everyone else?

272
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:17,392
Any news on those stains
by the window?

273
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,552
Lab report says
they're water stains,

274
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,152
with minute traces of blood.

275
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,152
Ooh, not ectoplasm, then

276
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:25,112
Someone clearing up a bloodstain?

277
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:27,472
The bloodstains
at the Goodfellows' cottage?

278
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:30,272
- Definitely human.
- Ooh, a scientific fact, at last

279
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:32,632
Did you ask about the postman?
Sam Nelms.

280
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,872
Lives in Beau Clayton. And, yes.

281
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:36,993
There was a delivery made
that morning.

282
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,233
Charlatan!

283
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,472
Anti-Christ!

284
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,633
How dare you come to my parish?

285
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,593
With your unholy gibberish
of witchcraft.

286
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,673
And you are...?

287
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,672
The Reverend Wallace Stone.

288
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:29,952
I am the guardian of the moral
health of the people of this parish.

289
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:32,232
People you seem happy to corrupt,

290
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,312
with your wicked talk
of psychic powers.

291
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:37,273
More than one path to the truth,
Reverend Stone.

292
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,632
Blasphemy!

293
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,873
If there are restless souls
in Monksbarton Woods...

294
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,632
..it's God's task
to give them their rest.

295
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,712
Not that of
an unscrupulous mountebank.

296
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:50,593
That's slander.

297
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:54,193
You'd do well to watch your tongue.

298
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:04,072
I foresee
big trouble between those two.

299
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,233
And I don't need a crystal ball
for that.

300
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:33,153
Anybody in?

301
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:37,192
What?

302
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:39,233
Causton CID.

303
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:47,472
What do we know about er... Mr Nelms?

304
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:50,912
He's been a postman in Beau Clayton
for three years.

305
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,552
Before that, delivery driver -
sacked.

306
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:55,832
Before that, milkman - sacked.

307
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,033
Why?
Thought to be on the fiddle.

308
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:04,232
I gave a statement.

309
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:07,073
We know that, Mr Nelms.
May we come in?

310
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:11,072
It's a bit... difficult just now.

311
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,473
We know that, too

312
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:28,873
- She's um...
- None of our business, Mr Nelms.

313
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:32,622
I'd like the postal packet
you were supposed to deliver

314
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:34,503
to one of the cottages
up at Monksbarton.

315
00:23:34,504 --> 00:23:36,024
The what?

316
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:38,672
There must have been something
to deliver, or why go there?

317
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:40,672
It must have been a packet,

318
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:43,233
or why not put it
through the letterbox?

319
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,833
It was so spooky.

320
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:52,592
Finding the place deserted.

321
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:54,632
I forgot about it.

322
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,713
Later, I realised I still had it.

323
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:01,952
Still... it can't be worth much,
can it?

324
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:03,873
Little plastic statue.

325
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,952
That is a...

326
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:09,993
is a Netski.

327
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,952
Look, Jones, how beautiful that is.

328
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,392
Is it... valuable?
Have you seen anything unusual

329
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:19,392
up at the Monksbarton cottages
recently?

330
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:20,952
Recently?

331
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:23,112
No.

332
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,912
Course, I've seen the lights
in the woods of a dark morning.

333
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:28,152
And I've heard those weird noises.
But seeing as

334
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:30,632
the woods are haunted,
that's only to be expected.

335
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,633
You believe those stories?
Do I look simple?

336
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,553
Listen. Um...

337
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,712
It'd be better if you could er...

338
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,712
keep quite about things - you know.

339
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:46,912
Keep quiet about a theft?
No.

340
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:48,713
About my... friend.

341
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:51,792
Your boss'll have to know
about this.

342
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:54,712
Yeah, well, jobs are easy enough
to come by. But erm...

343
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:56,752
She's a...

344
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,633
speciality act.

345
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:03,392
What did you call it? A net what?
A Netski.

346
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:06,032
Some of them are worth a fortune,
others not.

347
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,152
And this one?

348
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,632
Go and ask the expert.

349
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,512
As discussed...

350
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:13,833
John Temple.

351
00:25:17,393 --> 00:25:20,792
Yes, I remember.
She came in asking for a valuation.

352
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:23,072
And...?
Well, it's not ivory.

353
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:25,912
It's not old. 1950s, or thereabouts.

354
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:27,712
And carved from whale tooth.

355
00:25:27,713 --> 00:25:30,232
Eighty quid, perhaps?

356
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:33,792
A hundred, at best.
I made her an offer over the phone.

357
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:36,193
She turned it down
and I returned it by post.

358
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:39,553
I don't haggle.

359
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,633
A Mrs Smith, Sergeant Jones.

360
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:47,713
Mrs Smith.

361
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:01,393
Keep in line!

362
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,792
Creatures of darkness...

363
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:32,673
hear me!

364
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:37,872
Creatures of darkness...

365
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,193
hear me!

366
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,792
Creatures of darkness...

367
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:45,673
hear me!

368
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:06,072
The Netski was taken
to Temple Antiques by a Mrs Smith.

369
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:08,952
Obviously,
Nesta Goodfellow or Molly Thomas.

370
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,992
Yeah. Well, whoever took it...

371
00:27:10,993 --> 00:27:13,233
they certainly came from The Priory.

372
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:16,192
I think the present Mr Pargeter

373
00:27:16,193 --> 00:27:18,272
has been strapped for cash.

374
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:20,472
Hm.

375
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,712
You say some kids...
called at the station?

376
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:24,792
Yes. Up here on a dare.

377
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,952
Saw lights in the woods.

378
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:30,232
Oh, that'd be the wandering souls
of the dead

379
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,992
Is the entire population
of Beau Clayton...

380
00:27:32,993 --> 00:27:35,552
suffering from ghost fever?

381
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,513
Let my words reach you.

382
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,513
Let the flame of love be your balm.

383
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:45,072
Speak to me out of the dark.
I want you out of these woods,
all of you!

384
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:46,792
And out now!

385
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:49,152
Mr Barnaby, we're conducting
a healing ritual.

386
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:51,553
Anger has no place
in the circle of the phoenix.

387
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:54,912
We're expecting a spirit presence.

388
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:57,512
Are you? Yes, well, I'm sorry.

389
00:27:57,513 --> 00:28:00,112
But this area really is now
off limits.

390
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:02,952
So, I'd be very grateful
if you'd all leave.

391
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:05,953
And I'll arrest you... if you don't.

392
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:11,152
You heard that?

393
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:13,112
We all heard that!

394
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:14,913
The dead are speaking to me.

395
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,632
You must have heard it, sir.
It was a fox.

396
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:28,192
Or it was a bird or... whatever.

397
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:30,232
It didn't sound like a bird.

398
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:32,272
No, you're right.

399
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:34,312
It didn't, did it?

400
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,193
No.

401
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,153
And who are they?

402
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,953
I told you. I don't know!

403
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:18,232
But I would never leave them
to this scum of Corinth. No.

404
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,992
They'll be my very own assassins.

405
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,712
They'll take the princess
a gown of silk.

406
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:26,112
A golden crown.

407
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:30,352
But these, I'll drench
in poison so strong that anyone

408
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,913
who touches them will die in agony.

409
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,593
But the thing that tears my heart...

410
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:39,513
..is what must happen next.

411
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:43,953
I shall kill my children.
Kill them both.

412
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,112
No-one shall save them.

413
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,832
No-one shall own them.

414
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,752
And when I've brought
both Jason and his house

415
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:55,352
to ruin, I shall leave this land.

416
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,552
Unnatural woman,

417
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:00,352
flying from the death cries
of my darlings.

418
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:02,432
From their blood.

419
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,313
Their blood.

420
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:07,713
Their blood!

421
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:10,793
How is it I can bear such guilt...

422
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:14,513
..but not the laughter
of my enemies?

423
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:36,076
'I thought you said your dog
didn't bite .' 'Whose dog?'

424
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:39,036
'Your dog.'
'Yeah. But that's not my dog.'

425
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,276
12-bore shotgun, apparently.

426
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:42,837
Shot in the back.

427
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:48,716
- It was Molly Thomas, wasn't it?
- Positive ID from Mr Pargeter, yeah.

428
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,877
Bullard thinks she'd only been dead
a few hours.

429
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:53,837
So, what do you think?

430
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,797
I think that um...

431
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,996
She goes for the phone.

432
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:03,036
She doesn't make it.

433
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:05,076
She pulls the table over.

434
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:07,436
She turns the radio on full blast.

435
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,317
To try and attract attention.

436
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:13,156
I think the effort of...
reaching for the radio

437
00:31:13,157 --> 00:31:14,877
must have finished her off.

438
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:23,077
So, the question is...
how did she get back here?

439
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:25,436
And where from?

440
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:27,437
And why did she come back?

441
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,196
Where's Pargeter now?

442
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:32,077
He went back to The Priory.

443
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,517
She was shot in this room,
wasn't she?

444
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:44,236
And she was shot in the back.

445
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:46,117
She wasn't running away.

446
00:31:47,837 --> 00:31:49,676
It looks as if she was
facing the wall.

447
00:31:49,677 --> 00:31:51,756
Whoever killed her...

448
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:55,317
couldn't look her in the face
when they pulled the trigger.

449
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:06,037
Speak to me...

450
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:09,397
..and I will bring you peace.

451
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,796
To those who worship false gods,

452
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:15,836
I say...

453
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:18,117
'Harken and tremble...

454
00:32:19,277 --> 00:32:21,996
..you root of all evil,
you author of pain,

455
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:23,517
you begetter of death!

456
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,836
You will be cast out
with every Satanic power,

457
00:32:27,837 --> 00:32:30,436
with every unclean spirit,

458
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:33,276
and your voice will be stilled
and your hand will be stayed,

459
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:34,677
and your eye will be blind.

460
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:36,837
TURN from your way of darkness!

461
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:39,117
TURN from the devil's paths!

462
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:42,316
Or you must suffer
the torments of hell

463
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:43,957
through all eternity!'

464
00:32:49,797 --> 00:32:50,797
Well?

465
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:54,436
That was my rehearsal for Sunday.

466
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:57,036
Oh. I'm sorry, Wallace.

467
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:58,957
I wasn't really listening.

468
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:07,756
So, you were out walking,
Mr Pargeter. Am I right?

469
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:10,116
- Yes.
- In the woods.

470
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:12,236
They are my woods, Barnaby.

471
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:13,917
So, you're not put off
by talk of ghosts.

472
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:17,556
I frequently walk there.

473
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:19,676
I've come to no harm.
But you've seen the lights?

474
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:21,836
Heard strange cries?

475
00:33:21,837 --> 00:33:23,477
From time to time.

476
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:27,876
My family have lived with these
phenomena for many, many years.

477
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:31,036
If there are ghosts, it would seem
I've come to terms with them.

478
00:33:31,037 --> 00:33:33,036
So, you're coming back
from your walk...

479
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:35,156
you hear the radio...

480
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:37,476
you go into the cottage
and you find Mrs Thomas?

481
00:33:37,477 --> 00:33:39,876
Yes.
You didn't see anyone?

482
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:41,996
Hear a car driving away?

483
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:43,996
The place was... deserted.

484
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:46,716
Just... Molly Thomas lying there.

485
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:49,477
And erm... the radio on.

486
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:53,196
You're quite a collector,
Mr Pargeter.

487
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,676
In a small way.

488
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:57,716
Mostly pieces acquired by my family.

489
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:59,356
Of course, some of them have gone

490
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:01,916
to my least favourite charities

491
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,836
My ex-wives.

492
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:06,356
Also collectors, in their way

493
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:10,197
So, you've got er... valuable
antiques here, family heirlooms.

494
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,116
And no alarm system.
I did have one.

495
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,676
It tended to go off
three or four times a week.

496
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:18,077
For no good reason.

497
00:34:19,477 --> 00:34:22,596
Stanley and Nesta Goodfellow
kept an eye on things.

498
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:25,197
Yes, but they're not here now,
are they, Mr Pargeter?

499
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,316
Two murders, three people missing.
Don't you think

500
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:33,356
you'd be safer staying at the pub
in Beau Clayton?

501
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:36,317
But there's no alarm, Barnaby,
as you pointed out.

502
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:39,157
And all these valuable things.

503
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:41,477
As you said.

504
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:53,757
Did you see that?
Indeed, I did.

505
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:59,197
I think, Jones...

506
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:04,156
..whatever is in those woods...

507
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:06,676
it's time we met it face to face.

508
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:08,756
Come on.

509
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:10,716
Do ghosts have faces?

510
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:12,836
Oh, I think they do, yes.

511
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:14,717
Except the headless ones

512
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,197
- Stay close.
- I will

513
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:00,677
Did you hear that?

514
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:04,716
Where's that coming from?

515
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:06,796
I think it came from over there.

516
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,516
Ah. There's an echo, isn't there?

517
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,197
Hard to tell.

518
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:21,876
Jones! Where are you?

519
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:23,996
I'm here, sir!

520
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:25,956
Where are YOU?

521
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:27,876
Sir?

522
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:29,757
Jones?

523
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:35,837
Sir.

524
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,917
Are you there, sir?

525
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,116
Aargh!

526
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:22,356
Jones?!

527
00:37:22,357 --> 00:37:24,477
Aargh!

528
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,877
Aargh!

529
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:54,597
Who's there?!

530
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:16,516
Sir!
Aargh!

531
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:18,956
Jones.
I heard you call for help.

532
00:38:18,957 --> 00:38:20,996
I did not call for help.

533
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:24,037
I was attacked... by an owl.

534
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:27,316
I saw something.
What?

535
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:30,717
I don't know. Well, whatever it was,
Jones, it was not a ghost.

536
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:35,397
Someone has been tracking me.
But now I am the tracker.

537
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:37,797
Come on.

538
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,036
Stanley?

539
00:39:56,037 --> 00:39:58,557
It's Stanley Goodfellow.

540
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,556
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr McKay.

541
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,036
Mr Barnaby.
Yes.

542
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:33,236
I'm Mary McKay.

543
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:34,957
Stanley's upstairs. This way.
Thank you.

544
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:42,396
Stanley is suffering from
dissociative trauma.

545
00:40:42,397 --> 00:40:44,996
He experienced something
so terrifying,

546
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:47,196
his mind has simply
closed down on him.

547
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,556
It's a defence mechanism, of course.

548
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:51,636
Well, at the moment,
Stanley Goodfellow

549
00:40:51,637 --> 00:40:54,356
is the only man who can solve
the disappearance of his wife

550
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:56,116
and two other people.

551
00:40:56,117 --> 00:40:57,916
My problem is...

552
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,437
he can't speak.

553
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:04,396
Well... he's not saying
anything anyone can understand.

554
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:07,716
Words are a danger
to Stanley just now.

555
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,876
His subconscious is telling him

556
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:12,036
to reject speech because...

557
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:14,437
whatever happened to him
lies beyond description.

558
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,476
Well, when will he be um...?

559
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:20,996
He's lost touch with reality,
Mr Barnaby - we just can't say

560
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:24,036
when he'll want to return,
if ever.

561
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:25,837
Oh. Excuse me.

562
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,196
Jones?
Mystery body in the woods, sir.

563
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:32,156
Positive ID from The Met.

564
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,516
Terence Paul Lowther.

565
00:41:34,517 --> 00:41:36,636
Part of a well-organised
London gang

566
00:41:36,637 --> 00:41:38,836
that specialise in nicking antiques.

567
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:41,556
Good work.
I'm just leaving The Pines now.

568
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:43,236
Nothing yet from
Stanley Goodfellow.

569
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:45,836
- Well if you're on your way back...
- I'll pick you up.

570
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,476
I want to go down to the village,
pick up on the local gossip.

571
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:49,916
OK. We'll talk then.

572
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,277
Bye.

573
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,877
Your details, please?

574
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,956
Gail...? Are you free this evening?

575
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,396
After work? For a chat.

576
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:10,476
Yeah. Where shall we go?

577
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:12,276
Oh, a pub.
Yeah.

578
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:14,117
Yeah, lovely.

579
00:42:47,557 --> 00:42:49,837
- And here endeth...
- The first lesson

580
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:55,357
And here beginneth the second

581
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:07,876
The Met said Lowther could be
linked to half a dozen robberies
involving antiques.

582
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,516
That antique shop fellow.
John Temple?

583
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:13,956
What did he say about the Netski?
He reckoned it was worth about ã100.

584
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:15,876
Said it was modern -
nothing special.

585
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:19,116
Did he? Meaning...?
Maybe he was conning her into
selling it for a song.

586
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:22,916
You know. In either case, it must
have been taken from The Priory.

587
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:25,916
Why didn't Pargeter...
report the theft?

588
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:28,236
See that?
Yeah.

589
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:29,997
I'll follow you in.
Yeah, OK.

590
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:36,037
Excuse me. Could I...?

591
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:44,317
This village is ghost crazy,
if you ask me. There you go, mate.

592
00:43:45,477 --> 00:43:47,717
Oh, look out. Here's the law.
Hello, Mr Nelms.

593
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:50,716
A man of leisure, thanks to you lot.

594
00:43:50,717 --> 00:43:54,556
Gardening leave.
Don't let me interrupt you, sir.

595
00:43:54,557 --> 00:43:57,997
Carry on. What were you saying?
That something weird's going on.

596
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:00,516
But spirits?

597
00:44:00,517 --> 00:44:02,637
Spooks? I don't think so.

598
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,677
Shall we sit and wait for them
to come outside? Jones.

599
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,037
Detective Chief Inspector.
Mr Pargeter.

600
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:19,156
I was intending to come to see you.
I heard.

601
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,596
You did? About what?
Stanley Goodfellow. You found him.

602
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:24,796
Yes, indeed. In your woods.

603
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:26,797
Is it true that he's lost his mind?

604
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,236
He's under medical supervision
just now.

605
00:44:30,237 --> 00:44:33,236
I'm hoping to be able
to speak to him in due course.

606
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,237
But er... this is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

607
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:41,397
Ah, yes. Yes.

608
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:45,516
It was supposed to be delivered
to the Goodfellows.

609
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,996
Not really their thing.
We wondered if they were

610
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:49,836
taking it in for you.
No. No, no.

611
00:44:49,837 --> 00:44:51,716
This has no great value.

612
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:53,676
It's... nice enough.

613
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:56,796
I'm going to an antiques fair
in France

614
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:58,476
for a couple of days.

615
00:44:58,477 --> 00:45:01,796
I'd be grateful if the police could
watch The Priory while I'm away.

616
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:04,596
Mr Pargeter,
two murders have been committed.

617
00:45:04,597 --> 00:45:07,516
Both bodies were found on your land.

618
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:10,357
A visit to France...
out of the question.

619
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:15,316
This is outrageous.
I have business to attend to.

620
00:45:15,317 --> 00:45:18,357
Friend of yours?
Who?

621
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:20,477
Jones.

622
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:19,837
- Not his netsuke, then?
- Oh, no

623
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:23,516
Of course it is.
He's up to something.

624
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:25,716
Are we mobile yet?

625
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:28,156
Pit-stop wheel change, sir.
Oh, good.

626
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:30,596
Time in the Traffic Division
not wasted, then

627
00:46:30,597 --> 00:46:32,916
Thank you.

628
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:35,477
Exorcizamus te...

629
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:39,036
..omnis incursio

630
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:41,517
infernalis adversarii...

631
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:45,596
..omnis legio,

632
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,796
omnis congregatio,

633
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:50,276
et secta diabolica!

634
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:52,037
Jesu Christi!

635
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:02,516
I adjure you, Satan.

636
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:04,556
Yield now to God.

637
00:48:04,557 --> 00:48:06,757
Depart, accursed one!

638
00:48:08,397 --> 00:48:10,396
Depart, foul fiend!

639
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:12,317
Depart -

640
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,110
If there ARE restless souls
in these woods,

641
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:26,470
they are the souls of godly men.

642
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,950
And it is the work of God's minister
to bring them deliverance.

643
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,951
And you saw no-one.
No.

644
00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:33,991
Just...

645
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:39,191
Sitting up in his grave
as if it were... judgment day.

646
00:48:43,071 --> 00:48:47,391
Gases. Post-mortem gases, causing
expansion and consequent movement.

647
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:50,790
- It sometimes happens in the morgue.
- Really?

648
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,671
A body rising under a sheet.

649
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:55,270
He was buried.

650
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:58,551
It was a shallow grave,
like the other victim.
He was barely covered in earth.

651
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:02,750
Whoever buried him
must've been in a hurry.

652
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:05,591
Or didn't have the tools
to do the job. Do we know who he is?

653
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,910
Yes. It's Colin Thomas.

654
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:11,910
Positive ID from Stephens.
Cause of death, George.

655
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:14,231
Shotgun wound.
12-bore, by the look of it.

656
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:18,950
So, we've got two people dead,
one mad, one still missing.

657
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:20,990
Why these people?

658
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,550
What was it about them

659
00:49:22,551 --> 00:49:23,951
that made them the victims, eh?

660
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:27,750
There's something
we're still not seeing.

661
00:49:27,751 --> 00:49:31,151
Right. Let's start again. Let's have
another look round the cottages.

662
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,271
Sir!

663
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:05,470
Ticket to Florida
in the name of Nesta Goodfellow.

664
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:08,350
With a note.
Saying...? See you at the airport.

665
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:11,631
Is that note signed?
Sex bomb.

666
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:14,551
Our over-eager postman?

667
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:17,391
I wonder if her husband knew.

668
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:24,631
What?
Someone's in there!

669
00:50:30,751 --> 00:50:32,671
Oi! Hey... hey!

670
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:58,470
Don't kill him, sir!
He'll kill himself if he carries on.

671
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:00,031
How fast is he going?

672
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:21,110
He'll come out over
on the Beau Clayton road, won't he?

673
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,831
Whoa!

674
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:30,550
Lost him!

675
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:32,871
Not necessarily.

676
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:45,671
Take a look round the back.

677
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:57,910
Please don't say it was a hunch.
Observation.

678
00:51:57,911 --> 00:51:59,911
Saw it first time we called.
Didn't you?

679
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,950
Make sure he doesn't
jump out of the back window

680
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:09,871
and escape or something.

681
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:21,751
Muddy ride, was it

682
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:25,070
Did you find anything?

683
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:27,031
No.

684
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:31,070
A few coins in a jar.

685
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,950
Thought they might have other
bits and pieces hidden away.

686
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:37,270
Why were they hidden?
They were at it.

687
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:39,790
Nicking stuff up at The Priory.

688
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,550
A little nick here,
a little nick there.

689
00:52:42,551 --> 00:52:45,430
You had a look around
in the Goodfellows' cottage as well.

690
00:52:45,431 --> 00:52:48,471
Didn't you? Did you see
anything you fancied in there?

691
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,311
You can't get a 40-inch
plasma screen on a mountain bike.

692
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:57,950
'I am the way and the truth
and the life, ' says the Lord.

693
00:52:57,951 --> 00:53:01,110
For tempters and blasphemers abound.

694
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:04,191
And those who love evil
are in our midst.

695
00:53:06,631 --> 00:53:09,390
The times are out of joint...

696
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:13,070
where wrongdoers prosper
and the spawn of Satan multiplies.

697
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:15,870
Where the virtue finds no respect.

698
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:19,550
For who does not know that,
in the face of such evil,
it takes a man of courage

699
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:25,111
to stand up unafraid and say,
'I am for divine justice
and retribution'?

700
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,031
Stanley.

701
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:07,790
Did you know, Stanley...

702
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:12,110
that Nesta... was getting ready
to run off and leave you?

703
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,030
I wonder if you...

704
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:15,911
I wonder if you knew that.

705
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:36,350
You hold the key... Stanley.

706
00:54:36,351 --> 00:54:38,551
Somewhere inside. Sorry.

707
00:54:42,351 --> 00:54:44,271
What happened to you, eh?

708
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:56,030
The number plate of that SUV
was on the computer.

709
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:58,151
Stolen from an address in Chelsea
a week ago.

710
00:54:59,991 --> 00:55:03,270
Right. Let Chelsea know
it's been spotted here.

711
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:06,431
And get our Traffic Division
to watch out for it. Yes, Sarge.

712
00:55:14,351 --> 00:55:17,310
I don't know why you're coming.
You said you think he's a fake.

713
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:19,830
Well, he's a prime suspect,
for starters, Joyce.

714
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:22,950
It's a bit odd,
him suddenly turning up in Midsomer.

715
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:26,310
A bit opportune, don't you think?
Maybe all this psychic drivel

716
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:28,870
is a cover for something
more sinister.

717
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:32,310
Don't be ridiculous. Why on earth
should he want to kill anyone?

718
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:34,031
Give him someone to talk to.

719
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:38,550
The powers with which
I have been gifted

720
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:40,790
led me to the grave of a man

721
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:44,111
who'd fallen victim
to the forces of evil.

722
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:49,070
I intend to use these same powers...

723
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:50,951
to envision the whereabouts...

724
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:54,110
..of a missing woman.

725
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,590
Nesta Goodfellow.

726
00:55:56,591 --> 00:55:58,830
I'm so glad I came Shh!

727
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:00,911
The knife of light
will point the way.

728
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:08,631
I shall fall into a trance...

729
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:12,790
..and concentrate on
the strong psychic projection

730
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:15,150
of her fear.

731
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:18,430
I shall seek her out
in the dark night

732
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,431
of her distress.

733
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,070
Aargh!

734
00:56:29,071 --> 00:56:31,310
I can see her!

735
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:33,191
Agh!

736
00:56:34,351 --> 00:56:37,830
She lies... beneath
the sign of the witch.

737
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:40,070
Oh!

738
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:41,831
Of the witch!

739
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:47,911
For goodness sake. Come on!

740
00:56:51,471 --> 00:56:54,990
I mean, to talk to the dead!
How stupid is that?

741
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:58,550
I mean, what is the point
of talking to someone

742
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:00,990
who is incapable of listening?
You might do worse

743
00:57:00,991 --> 00:57:04,470
than follow up on what he said!
Oh, you mean, the inspired vision?

744
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:06,510
Well, look. Let's see.

745
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:08,750
A dark place, he says.

746
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:11,350
Three people have died,
two buried in shallow graves.

747
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:13,710
Of course he talks about
a dark place!

748
00:57:13,711 --> 00:57:15,830
And the sign of the witch?

749
00:57:15,831 --> 00:57:19,030
Witches.
Stock in trade of the phoney psychic.

750
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:21,110
Witches are bound to be
top of the agenda.

751
00:57:21,111 --> 00:57:22,750
He fainted!
Of course he did.

752
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,631
And how theatrical that was.

753
00:58:16,431 --> 00:58:18,351
It's fine. All clear.

754
01:00:19,871 --> 01:00:21,311
Right.

755
01:01:09,671 --> 01:01:12,230
I got your message.
YES... Jones.

756
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:14,510
Sorry, sir. Are you all right?

757
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:18,430
Of course I'm all right.
I didn't expect you to ambush me.
What happened?

758
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:22,270
Pargeter and the others loaded some
furniture in the SUV and drove off.

759
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:23,950
That's why he had to
stay in the house.

760
01:01:23,951 --> 01:01:26,110
Half those antiques he's got there?

761
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:28,790
Stolen. He's still in there.
Good chance to nab him.

762
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:32,390
No. We should wait.
He doesn't know we're onto him.

763
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:34,431
And I don't want to scare off
the delivery boys.

764
01:01:36,751 --> 01:01:39,030
Did it occur to you to follow them?

765
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:41,190
I made a quick phone call.

766
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:42,951
They won't be looking for
a woman driver.

767
01:02:31,775 --> 01:02:33,854
Uh-huh.

768
01:02:33,855 --> 01:02:35,735
I see.

769
01:02:37,775 --> 01:02:40,415
And you're absolutely certain.

770
01:02:41,815 --> 01:02:43,935
OK. Thank you.

771
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:50,574
Morning, Jones.
Morning, sir. Call from the lab.

772
01:02:50,575 --> 01:02:54,054
Blood in the Goodfellows' cottage?
Definitely not Colin Thomas's.

773
01:02:54,055 --> 01:02:55,774
Not?
Nope.

774
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:58,414
So, it's not Lowther's
and it's not Colin Thomas's.

775
01:02:58,415 --> 01:03:00,414
That poses a few questions.
Yeah.

776
01:03:00,415 --> 01:03:02,946
And Pargeter's got
more than a few to answer.

777
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:05,094
- Where are you going?
- Well, I thought we were...

778
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:07,174
No, no, no.

779
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:09,655
I think we give Pargeter and Temple
a little more rope.

780
01:03:10,815 --> 01:03:12,775
Come on.

781
01:03:16,495 --> 01:03:19,454
Maybe if we get off the track...
Maybe what?

782
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:21,335
Of course... I could be wrong.

783
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:24,335
Surely not

784
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,654
And after the news
here on Radio Causton,

785
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:36,654
we'll be talking to psychic
and ghost hunter Cyrus LeVanu,

786
01:03:36,655 --> 01:03:39,734
whose latest book Talking To
The Dead has just been published,

787
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:43,614
and asking him about
his recent sensational experiences

788
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,615
in the famously haunted
Monksbarton Woods.

789
01:03:55,295 --> 01:03:57,255
Yes.

790
01:04:01,455 --> 01:04:03,455
Ooh! That was close.

791
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:06,855
We're getting near.

792
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:17,415
Gotcha!

793
01:04:18,975 --> 01:04:21,174
That sound you're hearing, Jones.

794
01:04:21,175 --> 01:04:24,614
It's the sound of
a radio signal being blocked.

795
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:26,335
Somewhere...

796
01:04:27,415 --> 01:04:29,495
..up in that tree.

797
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,375
Well, it's not gonna be me.

798
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:43,815
Fine.

799
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:30,175
Jones? We've got another one here.
Oh!

800
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:43,935
Ah! There you are.

801
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,255
What have you got?

802
01:05:51,455 --> 01:05:53,814
Ah.

803
01:05:53,815 --> 01:05:57,494
I think we'll find
this little gizmo is well stocked
with mysterious noises.

804
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,894
And I reckon we'll find
a few others like this,

805
01:05:59,895 --> 01:06:02,054
courtesy of Cyrus LeVanu.

806
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:03,694
How did you know?
How?

807
01:06:03,695 --> 01:06:06,494
Well... last night,
after my car got stuck,

808
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,814
I had to walk about half a mile
through these woods.

809
01:06:08,815 --> 01:06:11,014
I could hear the cries and I knew

810
01:06:11,015 --> 01:06:13,414
there must be some sort of
rational explanation.

811
01:06:13,415 --> 01:06:17,094
And I thought how convenient
all this was for Cyrus LeVanu.

812
01:06:17,095 --> 01:06:21,614
Obviously, the woods weren't full
of his supporter stooges
whispering on cue.

813
01:06:21,615 --> 01:06:24,654
And then I thought I heard
this buzzing sound.

814
01:06:24,655 --> 01:06:26,455
Aagh!
And I...

815
01:06:27,895 --> 01:06:30,334
You all right, Jones?
I'm absolutely fine, sir.

816
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:32,054
Thanks for asking.
Well, come on.

817
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:36,014
And then I thought,
it's not ectoplasmic eruption
we're talking about here.

818
01:06:36,015 --> 01:06:38,174
It's radio waves.

819
01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:40,774
And then you found the body.
I mean...

820
01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:43,774
Wow! That must have been
one hell of a shock, wasn't it?

821
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:46,455
Not if, like me, you've been gifted
with special powers.

822
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,334
Gail... Oh, yeah?

823
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,814
On now?

824
01:06:55,815 --> 01:06:57,774
Thanks for letting me know.

825
01:06:57,775 --> 01:06:59,494
What's that?

826
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:01,654
This.

827
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:05,614
My last meeting
was a complete sellout,
so I will hold another one.

828
01:07:05,615 --> 01:07:08,094
Tonight at Beau Clayton Town Hall.

829
01:07:08,095 --> 01:07:10,574
And, although there are those
who would prevent me,

830
01:07:10,575 --> 01:07:14,294
I've every intention of returning
to Monksbarton Woods.

831
01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:17,334
Where you'll be...
Talking To The Dead!

832
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:20,334
Well, that's all we've got time for,
so a big thank you to our guest,

833
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:22,574
the psychic adventurer, Cyrus Leva-

834
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:24,974
Where's our
'psychic adventurer' staying?

835
01:07:24,975 --> 01:07:27,134
Er, The Monk's Retreat.

836
01:07:27,135 --> 01:07:29,614
I shall go there.
I want you to go to Temple Antiques.

837
01:07:29,615 --> 01:07:32,255
For whatever was shipped over there
last night. Yeah.

838
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:36,695
Oh!

839
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:46,774
Local radio shows might
seem small beer for someone like me.

840
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:50,254
There you go.
But er... the most important thing

841
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:52,254
is to get the message across.

842
01:07:52,255 --> 01:07:54,294
Loud and clear.

843
01:07:54,295 --> 01:07:57,335
Loud and clear, Mr LeVanu!

844
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:00,415
Like the signals
from your transmitters.

845
01:08:02,135 --> 01:08:04,894
Barnaby, what are you talking about?

846
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:08,814
Do you not know, Mr LeVanu? I'm
talking about the mysterious cries

847
01:08:08,815 --> 01:08:10,974
in Monksbarton Woods.

848
01:08:10,975 --> 01:08:14,134
But, of course,
there is a logical explanation.

849
01:08:14,135 --> 01:08:16,734
As you well know.
Where do you transmit from?

850
01:08:16,735 --> 01:08:18,614
Your room here?

851
01:08:18,615 --> 01:08:20,574
Your car?

852
01:08:20,575 --> 01:08:22,774
Or do you have an accomplice,
who helps you

853
01:08:22,775 --> 01:08:24,934
with your special effects?

854
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:27,214
I've never seen this object before
in my life.

855
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:29,374
What I find offensive
about people like you,

856
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:33,054
Mr LeVanu, is that you
feed off other people's anxieties.

857
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:36,175
And their pain.
You trade on their weaknesses.

858
01:08:38,135 --> 01:08:41,014
Ooh! Listen to that.
How spooky is that?

859
01:08:41,015 --> 01:08:43,095
Frightened me to death

860
01:08:58,415 --> 01:09:01,414
Detective Inspector Jones,
isn't it? Sergeant.

861
01:09:01,415 --> 01:09:03,694
I was wondering if you'd had
any more contact

862
01:09:03,695 --> 01:09:06,614
with Mrs Smith, the woman who -

863
01:09:06,615 --> 01:09:09,534
Brought in the Netski.
No. I did agree to phone if I -

864
01:09:09,535 --> 01:09:12,415
Yes. I was just passing and
thought it just as easy to pop in.

865
01:09:13,655 --> 01:09:15,535
Will you excuse me?

866
01:09:19,295 --> 01:09:21,294
Hello?

867
01:09:21,295 --> 01:09:24,134
Yes... Yes.

868
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:27,055
Erm... Yes. I think we'd agreed
the fourth of April.

869
01:09:29,055 --> 01:09:30,895
Well, you could bring it in
in the morning.

870
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:42,695
Oh, Gail.

871
01:09:44,695 --> 01:09:47,654
There's pictures on here
of some items of furniture.

872
01:09:47,655 --> 01:09:50,134
Let's see if Art and Antiques
can recognise something.

873
01:09:50,135 --> 01:09:52,255
Right... Sarge?

874
01:09:53,855 --> 01:09:56,574
Are we still on?
It's just that, last night -

875
01:09:56,575 --> 01:09:58,374
You were on extra duty.

876
01:09:58,375 --> 01:09:59,815
Of course.

877
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:04,135
Gail.

878
01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:07,495
Gail?

879
01:10:08,695 --> 01:10:10,415
Look...

880
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:13,415
What?

881
01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:18,615
No workplace involvements.

882
01:10:19,935 --> 01:10:22,094
It's just tough to have a...

883
01:10:22,095 --> 01:10:25,095
proper working relationship if...
we also have...

884
01:10:26,535 --> 01:10:29,015
..a relationship.
You think so?

885
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:34,975
It's never been a problem for me
in the past.

886
01:11:04,175 --> 01:11:07,615
Vile and untruthful accusations
have been made against me.

887
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:11,014
Those whom I considered steadfast

888
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:12,895
have abandoned me.

889
01:11:14,015 --> 01:11:16,734
Even thrown aside their belief.

890
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,254
No, it's you they've thrown aside.
Why?

891
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:21,894
Because you've been exposed
as a liar and a cheat.

892
01:11:21,895 --> 01:11:24,134
That's slanderous!
Not if it's the truth.

893
01:11:24,135 --> 01:11:27,214
And it is,
which is why your slavish followers

894
01:11:27,215 --> 01:11:30,334
have abandoned you.
I never put transmitters in trees.

895
01:11:30,335 --> 01:11:32,454
No, of course not

896
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,655
Now everyone's seen you
in your true colours...

897
01:11:35,695 --> 01:11:38,414
..why don't you pack up your tricks

898
01:11:38,415 --> 01:11:40,494
and your hocus-pocus and leave?

899
01:11:40,495 --> 01:11:42,495
Leave?

900
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:44,920
I won't be leaving.

901
01:11:44,921 --> 01:11:48,254
I will be returning
to Monksbarton Wood

902
01:11:48,255 --> 01:11:50,662
in the hope of bringing peace
to souls in torment.

903
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:53,054
Poison, LeVanu.
Your fake philosophy is poison.

904
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:54,815
Your ridiculous rituals are poison.

905
01:11:56,615 --> 01:11:58,535
You are poison.

906
01:12:59,533 --> 01:13:01,732
Jones.

907
01:13:01,733 --> 01:13:05,572
Sir. Quick response from the photos
I took at Temple Antiques.

908
01:13:05,573 --> 01:13:08,813
Four items definitely stolen,
two suspected.

909
01:13:09,893 --> 01:13:12,012
The table with the water stain

910
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,972
is part of a haul
from a house in Devon.

911
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:18,452
The Devon Police are pretty sure
a London gang was involved.

912
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:20,572
They turned them over,
but no result.

913
01:13:20,573 --> 01:13:23,812
So, the stuff must have gone to
a receiver the next day.

914
01:13:23,813 --> 01:13:27,012
Pargeter fences it to dealers.
Including John Temple.

915
01:13:27,013 --> 01:13:29,212
He's got the outlets -
here and abroad.

916
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:32,212
That's why he wanted to go to
the antiques fair in France.

917
01:13:32,213 --> 01:13:33,813
The SUV guys are his distributors.

918
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:38,333
Now all we have to do...
is find the murderer.

919
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,452
Barnaby.

920
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,572
You checked house and garden?
Thoroughly.

921
01:13:45,573 --> 01:13:48,612
He's not here. I'm sure of that.
You said you found a weapon.

922
01:13:48,613 --> 01:13:50,373
Ah, yes. Here.

923
01:13:54,453 --> 01:13:56,253
Has anyone touched it?
No.

924
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,532
There's blood on the blade.

925
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:01,093
What kind of a knife is it?

926
01:14:02,213 --> 01:14:04,093
It's er... a kris.

927
01:14:06,293 --> 01:14:08,533
It's a collector's item.
An antique?

928
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:14,332
Got backup?
On the way.

929
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:16,532
He's here, all right.

930
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:19,053
It's time to put the screws
on Mr Lynton Pargeter.

931
01:14:20,213 --> 01:14:22,252
Let's hurry.

932
01:14:22,253 --> 01:14:24,412
Right.

933
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:27,053
Take the upstairs rooms.
I'll look down here. And be careful.

934
01:15:38,613 --> 01:15:41,452
I heard one of those cries.
Yes, I know.

935
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,532
It was me.

936
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:45,293
Take a look at that.

937
01:15:46,533 --> 01:15:50,052
We have seriously misjudged
Cyrus LeVanu. It was Pargeter,

938
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:53,772
not LeVanu, responsible for those
strange noises in the woods.

939
01:15:53,773 --> 01:15:55,852
His way of keeping the locals out

940
01:15:55,853 --> 01:15:57,972
while he took delivery
of stolen goods.

941
01:15:57,973 --> 01:16:01,252
And the mysterious lights...
must have been from the vans.

942
01:16:01,253 --> 01:16:03,452
Delivering the dodgy antiques.

943
01:16:03,453 --> 01:16:05,852
Well, he's packed a case,
so it seems he'll be back.

944
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:08,173
Oh, he will. Airline ticket.

945
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:12,013
Guess where to.
Florida. Yep.

946
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,612
Pargeter and Nesta Goodfellow?

947
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,853
What's that?

948
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,253
Jones?

949
01:17:15,973 --> 01:17:18,132
In the woods, behind The Priory.

950
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,613
Behind The Priory!
Into the woods.

951
01:17:29,213 --> 01:17:30,533
Come on, quick!

952
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:35,213
All right? Straight through!

953
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:51,612
Gone.

954
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:53,492
Yeah. Gone to ground.

955
01:17:53,493 --> 01:17:54,933
Come on.

956
01:18:32,093 --> 01:18:35,172
How long can you keep this up,
Stanley?

957
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:37,613
Another week?

958
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:44,172
- Oh, very good, Stanley.
- It's very good

959
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:45,213
Had me fooled.

960
01:18:50,573 --> 01:18:52,372
Where is she, Stanley?

961
01:18:52,373 --> 01:18:54,253
Where is Nesta?

962
01:19:08,573 --> 01:19:10,493
Stay with him.

963
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:29,773
Dear God. Nesta?!

964
01:19:32,293 --> 01:19:33,573
Jones?!

965
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,022
I'm going to talk...

966
01:20:03,023 --> 01:20:06,217
to Mr Goodfellow
whilst you pay Mr Temple a visit.

967
01:20:06,703 --> 01:20:08,623
Yes, sir.

968
01:20:26,303 --> 01:20:28,302
Once it started...

969
01:20:28,303 --> 01:20:30,822
no going back.

970
01:20:30,823 --> 01:20:33,702
Pargeter was a fence,
a receiver of stolen goods.

971
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:36,182
You knew that.

972
01:20:36,183 --> 01:20:38,302
And he knew you knew.

973
01:20:38,303 --> 01:20:40,502
We could see what he was up to.

974
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:42,702
What could he do?

975
01:20:42,703 --> 01:20:44,622
If we didn't take too much,
he didn't worry.

976
01:20:44,623 --> 01:20:46,503
All of you?

977
01:20:47,903 --> 01:20:50,063
Colin and Molly Thomas too?
Colin was up for it.

978
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:53,382
Molly was unhappy. She...

979
01:20:53,383 --> 01:20:55,542
tried to get him to stop.

980
01:20:55,543 --> 01:20:58,102
If she'd succeeded,
he wouldn't have got involved

981
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,863
in the murder of Terry Lowther,
would he?

982
01:21:00,983 --> 01:21:02,783
I didn't mean to kill him.

983
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:08,622
He broke in.
He knew that Pargeter was in London,
so he didn't expect to see anyone.

984
01:21:08,623 --> 01:21:10,823
And you took him on.

985
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:23,742
The water stains on
the antique table and the carpet.

986
01:21:23,743 --> 01:21:26,022
They were caused
when you mopped up the blood.

987
01:21:26,023 --> 01:21:28,743
Mm. Then we buried him in the woods.

988
01:21:31,023 --> 01:21:33,022
But then Colin lost his nerve,
didn't he?

989
01:21:33,023 --> 01:21:34,463
It'll be all right.

990
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:38,902
How can it be all right? He's dead.

991
01:21:38,903 --> 01:21:40,822
He went home and told Molly.

992
01:21:40,823 --> 01:21:43,782
We've talked it over, Stan.
It's the only thing to do.

993
01:21:43,783 --> 01:21:46,342
They wanted to go to the police.

994
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:49,342
You buried him.
But you killed him.

995
01:21:49,343 --> 01:21:52,703
We hid the body. You think the
police are gonna be understanding?

996
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:02,383
That's it, Stan.
You can do as you please.

997
01:22:05,343 --> 01:22:06,983
No, Stan. Please. No.

998
01:22:09,423 --> 01:22:11,662
I didn't know what to do.

999
01:22:11,663 --> 01:22:13,543
I wasn't going to prison.
I knew that much.

1000
01:22:17,703 --> 01:22:19,902
We was on a good thing,
up there at The Priory.

1001
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:21,503
If only they'd listened to reason.

1002
01:22:25,383 --> 01:22:27,983
I thought I'd keep them
in the woods till they saw sense.

1003
01:22:30,063 --> 01:22:33,503
And then Colin decided
to have another go at me.

1004
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:37,102
No! No, please!

1005
01:22:37,103 --> 01:22:38,983
Please, stop it! No!

1006
01:22:41,063 --> 01:22:42,943
Colin!

1007
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:57,262
The thing was...

1008
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,223
I didn't mean to kill him either.

1009
01:23:00,663 --> 01:23:02,622
It was just...
one thing after another.

1010
01:23:02,623 --> 01:23:04,622
You know?

1011
01:23:04,623 --> 01:23:06,903
Just... one thing after another.

1012
01:23:08,623 --> 01:23:11,983
You buried Colin Thomas,
just as you buried Terry Lowther.

1013
01:23:13,223 --> 01:23:15,262
I made the women do it.

1014
01:23:15,263 --> 01:23:17,422
Get up!

1015
01:23:17,423 --> 01:23:20,022
I was gonna go back later
and make a proper job of it.

1016
01:23:20,023 --> 01:23:23,102
But... I knew I couldn't trust them.

1017
01:23:23,103 --> 01:23:27,822
So... we had to keep moving round
the woods, stay ahead of the police.

1018
01:23:27,823 --> 01:23:29,982
But I had to find
somewhere to keep 'em.

1019
01:23:29,983 --> 01:23:31,542
Somewhere safe.

1020
01:23:31,543 --> 01:23:33,743
So you thought of this shack.

1021
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:41,703
Well... I used to work
as a 'keeper on the estate,
before I worked at The Priory.

1022
01:23:42,783 --> 01:23:44,703
I know every inch of these woods.

1023
01:23:45,863 --> 01:23:48,183
But something went wrong,
didn't it, Stanley?

1024
01:23:49,343 --> 01:23:51,703
Molly Thomas somehow managed...
to escape.

1025
01:23:54,183 --> 01:23:56,823
They thought I would kill 'em.
I hadn't thought about it.

1026
01:23:57,983 --> 01:23:59,863
I hadn't thought about
anything much.

1027
01:24:02,143 --> 01:24:04,222
Molly ran indoors.

1028
01:24:04,223 --> 01:24:06,262
I was close behind.

1029
01:24:06,263 --> 01:24:07,822
No. Aargh!

1030
01:24:07,823 --> 01:24:09,623
I saw where she went.

1031
01:24:35,063 --> 01:24:37,182
There was nothing for it.

1032
01:24:37,183 --> 01:24:39,743
Well... no way back. Not then.

1033
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:45,103
But I... I couldn't...

1034
01:24:49,023 --> 01:24:51,343
You couldn't look at her, could you?

1035
01:24:53,943 --> 01:24:54,983
Turn round.

1036
01:25:16,103 --> 01:25:19,063
What... what have you done?

1037
01:25:20,663 --> 01:25:23,622
Perhaps I should have
killed Nesta then.

1038
01:25:23,623 --> 01:25:26,223
Yeah. I should have killed her.

1039
01:25:28,263 --> 01:25:29,982
But I didn't.

1040
01:25:29,983 --> 01:25:32,182
The fact is, Stanley,
you very nearly did.

1041
01:25:32,183 --> 01:25:33,823
Well, that was your fault.

1042
01:25:36,983 --> 01:25:39,342
I put her in the well,
keep her out of trouble.

1043
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:42,142
Then you caught me
and she was stuck down there.

1044
01:25:42,143 --> 01:25:45,422
And she must have been down there
when we found you the first time.

1045
01:25:45,423 --> 01:25:47,422
She didn't have the strength
to call out.

1046
01:25:47,423 --> 01:25:49,222
And this is my fault?

1047
01:25:49,223 --> 01:25:50,823
Definitely.

1048
01:25:52,223 --> 01:25:55,502
Oh, yeah. That was down to you.

1049
01:25:55,503 --> 01:25:58,743
Stanley, you could have
told someone where she was.

1050
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:03,662
She was getting ready to leave me.

1051
01:26:03,663 --> 01:26:05,583
I knew that.

1052
01:26:06,663 --> 01:26:08,982
Stealing things to pay for it all.

1053
01:26:08,983 --> 01:26:11,822
Did you know
it was Lynton Pargeter...

1054
01:26:11,823 --> 01:26:13,982
that she was having an affair with?

1055
01:26:13,983 --> 01:26:16,262
Not until he came at me
with a knife.

1056
01:26:16,263 --> 01:26:18,103
I wasn't expecting it.

1057
01:26:19,303 --> 01:26:21,742
Otherwise he'd never
have got close enough.

1058
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:24,343
What have you done, you bastard?
Where's Nesta? Dead?

1059
01:26:28,263 --> 01:26:29,702
Aargh!

1060
01:26:29,703 --> 01:26:31,182
Then it was him...

1061
01:26:31,183 --> 01:26:33,182
or me.

1062
01:26:33,183 --> 01:26:35,342
No choice in the matter.

1063
01:26:35,343 --> 01:26:38,222
You caught up with him
at The Priory.

1064
01:26:38,223 --> 01:26:41,142
What I don't understand
is how you got there so quickly.

1065
01:26:41,143 --> 01:26:43,622
I mean, all he had to do
was grab his case,

1066
01:26:43,623 --> 01:26:45,543
chuck it into a car and he'd be gone.

1067
01:26:46,903 --> 01:26:49,182
I've lived round Beau Clayton
all my life.

1068
01:26:49,183 --> 01:26:51,263
I know every track, every shortcut.

1069
01:26:52,343 --> 01:26:54,942
His bad luck. He got back first.

1070
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,503
But I came across the fields.

1071
01:26:59,623 --> 01:27:01,543
He wasn't quick enough.

1072
01:27:42,183 --> 01:27:44,023
No! Aaaargh!

1073
01:27:53,623 --> 01:27:55,982
John Temple is very anxious
to co-operate.

1074
01:27:55,983 --> 01:28:00,223
Is he? Shouldn't be long before
we find Pargeter's delivery men.

1075
01:28:01,383 --> 01:28:03,222
Was he...
Forthcoming?

1076
01:28:03,223 --> 01:28:05,062
Yes.

1077
01:28:05,063 --> 01:28:06,702
Surprisingly so.

1078
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:09,703
Except... perhaps not such a surprise.

1079
01:28:10,943 --> 01:28:13,862
Sir?
He could have been miles away

1080
01:28:13,863 --> 01:28:17,222
by the time we found the body.
Yet, when we chased him,

1081
01:28:17,223 --> 01:28:19,302
where does he come?
He comes back here.

1082
01:28:19,303 --> 01:28:21,063
Where we found him
in the first place.

1083
01:28:22,503 --> 01:28:24,702
Perhaps he wanted to be caught.

1084
01:28:24,703 --> 01:28:26,703
Perhaps he wanted her to be found.

1085
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,503
See? It's all your fault, really.

1086
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:36,662
Still doing his mad act, then?

1087
01:28:36,663 --> 01:28:38,863
I'm not sure he's acting. Not now.

1088
01:28:40,103 --> 01:28:42,183
A horseshoe over water.

1089
01:28:43,783 --> 01:28:46,102
A witch's sign,
my Welsh granny used to say.

1090
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:47,982
She's in a dark place.
It's dark.

1091
01:28:47,983 --> 01:28:50,182
She cannot speak, she cannot see.

1092
01:28:50,183 --> 01:28:53,423
She lies... beneath
the sign of the witch!

1093
01:28:56,223 --> 01:28:58,183
No. It's nonsense.

1094
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:07,742
I preached to the people, Sarah.

1095
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:09,782
Now the truth has been heard.

1096
01:29:09,783 --> 01:29:11,583
The blasphemer is unmasked.

1097
01:29:12,743 --> 01:29:14,982
Sarah?
I'm sorry, Wallace.

1098
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:16,783
I've had enough.

1099
01:29:18,183 --> 01:29:21,462
What do you mean?
I don't understand. No.

1100
01:29:21,463 --> 01:29:23,343
Of course you don't.

1101
01:29:25,863 --> 01:29:28,022
Surely it's too late
for the postman.

1102
01:29:28,023 --> 01:29:30,102
No.

1103
01:29:30,103 --> 01:29:32,143
Perfect timing.

1104
01:29:41,103 --> 01:29:43,302
So, it was your fault.

1105
01:29:43,303 --> 01:29:45,342
What was my fault?
It was your fault

1106
01:29:45,343 --> 01:29:48,302
that LeVanu was accused of fraud.
He is a fraud.

1107
01:29:48,303 --> 01:29:50,782
You're such a cynic.
Joyce...

1108
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:54,702
people like ghost stories,
they enjoy being scared.

1109
01:29:54,703 --> 01:29:56,622
It's basic human nature.

1110
01:29:56,623 --> 01:29:58,382
You don't believe it all, do you?

1111
01:29:58,383 --> 01:30:01,262
Well, why not? I have an open mind.

1112
01:30:01,263 --> 01:30:03,302
Unlike some people.

1113
01:30:03,303 --> 01:30:05,183
Hm. All right.

1114
01:30:08,943 --> 01:30:09,943
Come on.

1115
01:30:11,343 --> 01:30:13,702
I don't care how you rationalise it.

1116
01:30:13,703 --> 01:30:15,982
There's definitely
something spooky here.

1117
01:30:15,983 --> 01:30:17,782
Yeah. Well, so people say.

1118
01:30:17,783 --> 01:30:20,262
Accounts of the mass murder
in Monksbarton Woods

1119
01:30:20,263 --> 01:30:22,982
have been handed down
from generation to generation.

1120
01:30:22,983 --> 01:30:26,942
There is a theory that the very
stones of The Priory, even the earth,

1121
01:30:26,943 --> 01:30:28,662
where the victims fell,

1122
01:30:28,663 --> 01:30:31,782
is imprinted with psychic recordings
of those terrible events.

1123
01:30:31,783 --> 01:30:35,222
And Cyrus LeVanu
traded on that theory.

1124
01:30:35,223 --> 01:30:38,982
I was wrong about LeVanu
just in one respect.

1125
01:30:38,983 --> 01:30:41,502
It was Pargeter,
not LeVanu, who put...

1126
01:30:41,503 --> 01:30:45,982
speakers in the trees to scare off...
the locals. Right.

1127
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:49,223
Let's see if we can summon up...
a ghostly presence for you.

1128
01:30:51,063 --> 01:30:52,903
Joyce?

1129
01:30:53,983 --> 01:30:54,983
Joyce?

1130
01:30:58,543 --> 01:31:00,463
Joyce. What is it? Are you all right?

1131
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:05,583
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

1132
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:22,862
Very strange,
and difficult to explain, really.

1133
01:31:22,863 --> 01:31:25,062
Is it, George?

1134
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,782
Stan Goodfellow
encounters him in the woods,

1135
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:30,862
thinks he might raise the alarm
and kills him to keep him quiet.

1136
01:31:30,863 --> 01:31:33,502
No, Tom. This man died recently.

1137
01:31:33,503 --> 01:31:35,702
This morning, in fact.

1138
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:38,782
Long after Stanley Goodfellow
was arrested. No.

1139
01:31:38,783 --> 01:31:40,822
It's the manner of his death.

1140
01:31:40,823 --> 01:31:43,063
I've heard of it and never seen it.

1141
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:47,023
Parasympathetic rebound.

1142
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:50,582
It happens when
someone is so terrified

1143
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:54,502
that the whole
metabolic system reacts
and tries to calm itself down.

1144
01:31:54,503 --> 01:31:58,303
The problem is,
it can make too good a job of it,
and the heart simply stops beating.

1145
01:32:00,423 --> 01:32:03,423
I don't know what it was he
encountered in Monksbarton Woods.

1146
01:32:04,543 --> 01:32:06,623
Frankly, I hope I never find out.

1147
01:32:11,063 --> 01:32:12,463
Aargh!

1148
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:23,063
Parasympathetic rebound.

1149
01:32:24,903 --> 01:32:27,022
You're telling me
that Cyrus LeVanu...

1150
01:32:27,023 --> 01:32:28,983
died of fright.
