1
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,530
Hello?

2
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:47,759
Hello?

3
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:57,787
Stan?

4
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,593
Nesta?

5
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:56,431
Thank you.

6
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:40,003
Well, it's blood, alright.
Whether it's human is another matter.

7
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:44,761
- And this is how it was found?
- Yeah, same as the other cottage

8
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,583
Breakfast on the table,
tea still warm.

9
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:49,422
Kettle on the hob.
No sign of the occupants.

10
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:51,514
If that is not human blood, George,
what is it?

11
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:57,444
Four people live in these cottages
and no sign of any of them.

12
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,572
I'll get the lab to run a check.

13
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:01,156
And the postman called us in?

14
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:03,255
- Noticed the blood stain, apparently.
- Yeah, where is he?

15
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:04,925
On his rounds,
as far as we know.

16
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:08,128
That big house we passed
on the way here.

17
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,700
- The priory?
- Yeah. See if there's anyone in.

18
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,101
So, George. In this cottage we got
Nesta and Stanley Goodfellow.

19
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:16,960
What about the other?

20
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,901
The Thomases.
Molly and Colin.

21
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:19,970
Did you know them?

22
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,327
I did the post mortem on
their 10-year-old son Peter.

23
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,243
He ran away from home
after an argument.

24
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:28,762
Found wandering in Monksbarton
Woods for a couple of days.

25
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,969
He was alive when they found him
but he died soon after.

26
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,077
Suspicious death?

27
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,763
No, no, no. He died of
hypothermia.

28
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:37,523
When they found Peter,
he was jibbering.

29
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:38,907
No one could understand him.

30
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:41,158
The locals had it that
he was speaking in tongues.

31
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:45,307
Isn't there some kind of mystery
surrounding Monksbarton Woods?

32
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,410
Well, I don't know any
details, Tom.

33
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,295
The man you want's
Wallace Stone, local historian.

34
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,807
He's the vicar over at
Beau Clayton.

35
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:55,353
Bit of a hellfire and
damnation man, too.

36
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:57,812
Water stains?
It could be.

37
00:12:57,813 --> 00:13:00,613
Dunno.
Ask Forensics to pay us a visit.

38
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,427
I made some enquiries, though.

39
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:04,562
It's owned by a Lynton Pargeter.

40
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,016
He lives in London,
but the place has been

41
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:08,140
in the family for as long as
anyone can remember.

42
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,159
Who lives there now?

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,778
He does.
Last of the Pargeters.

44
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,743
It's a big place for a
weekend retreat, isn't it?

45
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,089
- Not if you're rich.
- Is he?

46
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,589
Well, I looked through the window,
the place is stuffed with antiques.

47
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,463
Right. Check his details.
Give him a ring.

48
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,859
You drive. Drop me off at
Beau Clayton vicarage.

49
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,699
I want to talk to a
Reverend Stone.

50
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,088
Monksbarton Woods... er...
haunted, apparently.

51
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:30,128
By what?

52
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:33,415
The ghosts of monks, Mr Barnaby.

53
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,025
Men of the cloth who
died violent deaths.

54
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,349
There was once a thriving
religious community

55
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,396
in Monksbarton.

56
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,889
The abbey was destroyed during
the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

57
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:48,682
And the priory is
all that's left?

58
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:51,462
When the soldiers arrived,
the monks fled into the woods...

59
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,341
they were hunted down
and slaughtered.

60
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:58,923
Local legend says their death cries
can sometimes still be heard.

61
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:03,194
This village is obsessed
by Monksbarton legends.

62
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:07,827
We're plagued by ghost hunters,
fanatics and freaks.

63
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,771
Half the village is among them.
I'm a man of God, Mr Barbaby.

64
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,872
There's no place for superstition
in my religion.

65
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,091
Sarah!

66
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:18,151
Could you tell me, please,
about Peter Thomas.

67
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,075
The boy had a silly argument
with his mother,

68
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,814
ran away, got lost.

69
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,316
Died of exposure.
Sarah!

70
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:28,736
It was said that when he
was found he was... erm...

71
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:30,697
Speaking in tongues, yes.

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
Utter nonsense.

73
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:36,138
And near blasphemous
nonsense at that.

74
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,414
I preached a sermon against it.
Did you press my jacket?

75
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,992
Why was he not found sooner?

76
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:47,231
The woods must've
been his playground.

77
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:50,799
No, Colin and Molly Thomas lived
all their lives here in Beau Clayton.

78
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,038
They only moved to Monksbarton
after Peter died.

79
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,314
Molly got the idea
that she'd be nearer to her

80
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,836
dead son's spirit up there.

81
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:02,540
She thought she might be able to
get in touch, ask for forgiveness.

82
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,426
She had a breakdown.

83
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,234
She wasn't in her right mind.

84
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:12,170
Country people, Mr Barnaby.

85
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:15,327
Simple minds can be
easily ensnared...

86
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,342
by the talk of ghosts and ghouls
and the walking dead.

87
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:23,144
Frankly, I'd have preferred a
city parish, but it seems...

88
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:25,666
I'm not thought suitable.

89
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:28,668
Odd, don't you think?

90
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,571
To be spurned for the
strength of one's belief?

91
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:35,911
Did Molly Thomas
come to you for help?

92
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,720
No, she spoke to my wife,
for all the good it did.

93
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:43,434
Did you think that Mrs Thomas
was unbalanced?

94
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:46,452
Mrs Stone?

95
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:53,559
She was a woman in grief.

96
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:02,119
What do you know about
Monksbarton?

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,612
Monksbarton.

98
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:07,025
Apart from the two cottages
it's just the priory now.

99
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,719
With Stanley Goodfellow and
his wife to look after it.

100
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,761
Colin and Molly Thomas?

101
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:14,759
Colin's the manager of Benyon's
Woodyard in Beau Clayton.

102
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:18,021
After Peter died, Molly insisted
they move up to Monksbarton.

103
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:19,254
Did you know them?

104
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,429
I was part of the investigation
into the boy's death.

105
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,255
Molly was in a bad way.

106
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:29,082
So the Goodfellows are...
what, caretakers?

107
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,752
They manage the priory and
the woodland that surrounds it.

108
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:36,356
Stanley Goodfellow used to be a
gamekeeper up on the Farley estate.

109
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,680
So, a normal couple.

110
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,588
Nesta was know to be
a bit of a goer.

111
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,771
They say she had
a couple of affairs.

112
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:45,444
You know... just the usual.

113
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,345
Hello.

114
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,071
Yes. Just a moment.

115
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:57,875
- Can we pick this up later?
- Okay.

116
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,488
Drink after work?

117
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,229
Yeah, great.

118
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,868
Mr Pargeter...

119
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,787
Pargeter's on his way here?

120
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:08,992
He is.

121
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:12,570
Keys to the priory, just
where he said they'd be.

122
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,728
Where's the post?

123
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,350
Postman called this morning.

124
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:20,852
Where's the post?

125
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,158
Got scared and forgot
to leave it?

126
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,535
We'll ask him.

127
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:27,896
I'll check for return post.

128
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,912
Nice telly!

129
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:31,889
Plasma screen...

130
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:35,501
Every moment of footballing magic
in high definition.

131
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,905
- It's expensive?
- 15-hundred? Two grand?

132
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:42,015
Whew.
On a laborer's wage?

133
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:46,946
Forward!

134
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,198
Forward!

135
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:00,112
What?
You didn't hear it?

136
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:02,153
- It's a fox.
- Didn't sound like a fox to me.

137
00:09:03,353 --> 00:09:05,752
Oh, all right.
It's the howl of a were-wolf,

138
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,113
ravening for blood.

139
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,713
Lucky I'm here
to protect you, then.

140
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:37,513
What's that?

141
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:42,752
Oh, that, Jones... is an iron maiden.

142
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,753
It's a medieval
instrument of torture.

143
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,752
Ooh!

144
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:56,473
A slow lingering death
in exquisite torment.

145
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,512
Different interrogation techniques
in those days.

146
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:03,352
All right. You take the rooms
upstairs. I'll look down here.

147
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,712
And make it quick. Chop, chop!

148
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,633
You don't expect to find them?
Not unless they're all dead.

149
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:15,513
Ooh! Yeah.

150
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:31,992
Jones?

151
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,273
Hello?

152
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:04,993
Jones, can you bring the keys?

153
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:33,673
Help!

154
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:45,832
You slammed the door.
Yeah. Any punctures?

155
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,232
No! You slammed the door.

156
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:49,713
No punctures?

157
00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:53,272
No punctures?

158
00:11:53,273 --> 00:11:55,992
Aah! That, Jones...

159
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:58,432
is because this version
of the iron maiden

160
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:00,832
uses a mechanical device

161
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,832
to do its work.

162
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,793
See?

163
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,752
Instead of being impaled immediately,

164
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:16,472
the victim would suffer
the slow advance

165
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,273
of the spikes.
It's neat.

166
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,153
Good job this IS the more
sophisticated version. Otherwise...

167
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,513
Got the keys?

168
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:29,433
Thank you. Come on.

169
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,312
Break in.
Yeah, seems so.

170
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:46,393
And take a look at this.

171
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,712
Something has taken the polish
off the table.

172
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:56,512
Water stains?
It could be.

173
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:59,312
Dunno.
Ask Forensics to pay us a visit.

174
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,952
Detective Sergeant Jones?

175
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:03,112
Lynton Pargeter.
We spoke on the phone.

176
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:06,633
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby.
Causton CID. Chief Inspector.

177
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:08,833
Oh, dear.

178
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:14,832
Did you do this?

179
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,673
No, sir, we did not.

180
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,192
You've had a break-in.
Perhaps you'd look around.

181
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:22,312
See if you've got anything missing.

182
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:24,073
Apart from my tenant workers

183
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:30,152
Just in time.
I got you a Chicken Jalfrezi.
Didn't have time to cook.

184
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:32,032
What?

185
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,712
Busy day, love?

186
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:38,032
Yes. I went to a fascinating talk
at Beau Clayton village hall.

187
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,393
Cyrus LeVanu.
Oh, for crying out loud.

188
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,272
He's a very interesting man.
He's not interesting.

189
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:47,072
He's a con, a charlatan, a phoney.
Have you seen his TV show?

190
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:49,712
Yes.
Well, it's... it's... it's laughable.

191
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:53,032
Isn't it? I mean, what does he
call himself? The ghostbuster

192
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,112
Ghost HUNTER. Ghost hunter.
You have a closed mind.

193
00:13:56,113 --> 00:13:58,472
I do not have a closed mind.

194
00:13:58,473 --> 00:14:00,272
I'm a copper.

195
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,913
I can spot a phoney a mile away
and LeVanu fits the bill exactly.

196
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,872
What's he doing in Causton?

197
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:08,872
The ghostly monks.
He's here for the anniversary.

198
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:10,712
What anniversary?

199
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:12,953
Of the massacre. It's tomorrow.

200
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,673
He's holding a ceremony
of spiritual healing in the woods.

201
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:21,913
Did I order that?

202
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:48,033
Unquiet spirits, speak to me.

203
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:56,033
I feel something.

204
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:59,273
Something tremulous in the ether.

205
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:02,753
Something that speaks of bloodshed
and darkness.

206
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,592
A spirit voice crying for help.

207
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,433
Oh, wonderful

208
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:24,672
We're in the company
of troubled souls.

209
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,072
Excuse me... Mr LeVanu.

210
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,952
Are you a seeker after truth?
No.

211
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:32,112
Er, yes... Well, not en-

212
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:34,433
I am a police officer.

213
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:38,832
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby
from Causton CID.

214
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,112
And these woods, sir, are off limits.

215
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:43,232
Is this a crime scene?

216
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,672
Well, no.

217
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:46,752
It isn't.
Quite.

218
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:50,592
These woods are full of voices
of tormented souls, Mr Barnaby.

219
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,792
And I'm here to bring them peace.

220
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:55,312
With the express permission
of Mr Lynton Pargeter.

221
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:56,552
Pargeter?

222
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,112
Full... and express permission...

223
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:01,152
of Mr Pargeter.

224
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,833
Our mission begins.

225
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,193
Restless spirit, speak to me.

226
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,153
Unquiet spirit, speak to me.

227
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:42,672
My God!

228
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,393
What was that?

229
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,152
A spirit presence calling for help.

230
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,273
We must go deeper. Always deeper.

231
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:12,832
How long's he been dead?

232
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,952
Well, it's a shallow grave,
so some insulation.

233
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:18,072
Looking at the state of the body,

234
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:19,992
insect infestation and so on,

235
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,192
at least three days.

236
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:24,512
You must have known Colin Thomas.
Is this him?

237
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:26,952
No, I met Molly once,
but never Colin.

238
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:27,953
Ah!

239
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:31,912
Gail. Can you identify the body?
He'd be able to help.

240
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:34,273
What with being able to
talk to the dead

241
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:40,552
So. Is this Colin Thomas
or Stanley Goodfellow?

242
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,433
Neither of them.
I've never seen that man before.

243
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:45,913
I was drawn to him, Barnaby.

244
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:49,233
Called by the dead.

245
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:54,232
Erm, this officer
will take your statement,

246
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,592
Mr LeVanu - then you can go.

247
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,792
Go?

248
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:01,833
Go where? It must be plain to you
that I'm needed here.

249
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,473
I'm blessed with a great gift.

250
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:15,392
So, this man
isn't one of my tenants.

251
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:17,392
No, we don't know who he is yet.

252
00:19:17,393 --> 00:19:20,432
We'll be asking you to view the body
in case you can identify him.

253
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:23,392
Me? Why would I know him?
Just for elimination purposes.

254
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:25,312
Excuse me.
Yes, Gail.

255
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:27,193
Mr Pargeter.

256
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:33,752
I understand that you've given Cyrus
LeVanu full access to the woods.

257
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,352
Yes, I have.

258
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:37,953
Well, it's making my job
very difficult, sir.

259
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,832
You know some people think
that Mr LeVanu is a charlatan?

260
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,792
A fraud?

261
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,393
Do you share their view?

262
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,712
On the contrary.

263
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:50,753
I think Cyrus LeVanu
is a gifted psychic.

264
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:55,072
If the troubled souls
of those who were murdered

265
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:57,192
still wander these woods,
perhaps LeVanu

266
00:19:57,193 --> 00:20:00,633
might find a way
of bringing them... rest.

267
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:04,512
My granny used to read tea leaves.

268
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:07,352
She saw a ghost once.
It walked through the wall.

269
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:09,792
Why don't they use the doors,
like everyone else?

270
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,392
Any news on those stains
by the window?

271
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:14,552
Lab report says
they're water stains,

272
00:20:14,553 --> 00:20:16,152
with minute traces of blood.

273
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:18,152
Ooh, not ectoplasm, then

274
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:20,112
Someone clearing up a bloodstain?

275
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:22,472
The bloodstains
at the Goodfellows' cottage?

276
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:25,272
- Definitely human.
- Ooh, a scientific fact, at last

277
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:27,632
Did you ask about the postman?
Sam Nelms.

278
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,872
Lives in Beau Clayton. And, yes.

279
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:31,993
There was a delivery made
that morning.

280
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,233
Charlatan!

281
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,472
Anti-Christ!

282
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:09,633
How dare you come to my parish?

283
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,593
With your unholy gibberish
of witchcraft.

284
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:16,673
And you are...?

285
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:21,672
The Reverend Wallace Stone.

286
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:24,952
I am the guardian of the moral
health of the people of this parish.

287
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:27,232
People you seem happy to corrupt,

288
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,312
with your wicked talk
of psychic powers.

289
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:32,273
More than one path to the truth,
Reverend Stone.

290
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:35,632
Blasphemy!

291
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,873
If there are restless souls
in Monksbarton Woods...

292
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:41,632
..it's God's task
to give them their rest.

293
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,712
Not that of
an unscrupulous mountebank.

294
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:45,593
That's slander.

295
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:49,193
You'd do well to watch your tongue.

296
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:59,072
I foresee
big trouble between those two.

297
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:01,233
And I don't need a crystal ball
for that.

298
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,153
Anybody in?

299
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:32,192
What?

300
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:34,233
Causton CID.

301
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:42,472
What do we know about er... Mr Nelms?

302
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:45,912
He's been a postman in Beau Clayton
for three years.

303
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:48,552
Before that, delivery driver -
sacked.

304
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:50,832
Before that, milkman - sacked.

305
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,033
Why?
Thought to be on the fiddle.

306
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:59,232
I gave a statement.

307
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:02,073
We know that, Mr Nelms.
May we come in?

308
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:06,072
It's a bit... difficult just now.

309
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:07,473
We know that, too

310
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:23,873
- She's um...
- None of our business, Mr Nelms.

311
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:27,622
I'd like the postal packet
you were supposed to deliver

312
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,503
to one of the cottages
up at Monksbarton.

313
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:31,024
The what?

314
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:33,672
There must have been something
to deliver, or why go there?

315
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:35,672
It must have been a packet,

316
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:38,233
or why not put it
through the letterbox?

317
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,833
It was so spooky.

318
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:47,592
Finding the place deserted.

319
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,632
I forgot about it.

320
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:51,713
Later, I realised I still had it.

321
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,952
Still... it can't be worth much,
can it?

322
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,873
Little plastic statue.

323
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:03,952
That is a...

324
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:04,993
is a Netski.

325
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:08,952
Look, Jones, how beautiful that is.

326
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:11,392
Is it... valuable?
Have you seen anything unusual

327
00:24:11,393 --> 00:24:14,392
up at the Monksbarton cottages
recently?

328
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:15,952
Recently?

329
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,112
No.

330
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:20,912
Course, I've seen the lights
in the woods of a dark morning.

331
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:23,152
And I've heard those weird noises.
But seeing as

332
00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:25,632
the woods are haunted,
that's only to be expected.

333
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,633
You believe those stories?
Do I look simple?

334
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:34,553
Listen. Um...

335
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,712
It'd be better if you could er...

336
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:39,712
keep quite about things - you know.

337
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:41,912
Keep quiet about a theft?
No.

338
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,713
About my... friend.

339
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,792
Your boss'll have to know
about this.

340
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:49,712
Yeah, well, jobs are easy enough
to come by. But erm...

341
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:51,752
She's a...

342
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:53,633
speciality act.

343
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:58,392
What did you call it? A net what?
A Netski.

344
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:01,032
Some of them are worth a fortune,
others not.

345
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,152
And this one?

346
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,632
Go and ask the expert.

347
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,512
As discussed...

348
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:08,833
John Temple.

349
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:15,792
Yes, I remember.
She came in asking for a valuation.

350
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:18,072
And...?
Well, it's not ivory.

351
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:20,912
It's not old. 1950s, or thereabouts.

352
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,712
And carved from whale tooth.

353
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,232
Eighty quid, perhaps?

354
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:28,792
A hundred, at best.
I made her an offer over the phone.

355
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,193
She turned it down
and I returned it by post.

356
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,553
I don't haggle.

357
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:39,633
A Mrs Smith, Sergeant Jones.

358
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:42,713
Mrs Smith.

359
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:56,393
Keep in line!

360
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,792
Creatures of darkness...

361
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,673
hear me!

362
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:32,872
Creatures of darkness...

363
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:34,193
hear me!

364
00:26:36,713 --> 00:26:38,792
Creatures of darkness...

365
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,673
hear me!

366
00:26:56,353 --> 00:27:01,072
The Netski was taken
to Temple Antiques by a Mrs Smith.

367
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:03,952
Obviously,
Nesta Goodfellow or Molly Thomas.

368
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:05,992
Yeah. Well, whoever took it...

369
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:08,233
they certainly came from The Priory.

370
00:27:09,273 --> 00:27:11,192
I think the present Mr Pargeter

371
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:13,272
has been strapped for cash.

372
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:15,472
Hm.

373
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:17,712
You say some kids...
called at the station?

374
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:19,792
Yes. Up here on a dare.

375
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:21,952
Saw lights in the woods.

376
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:25,232
Oh, that'd be the wandering souls
of the dead

377
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:27,992
Is the entire population
of Beau Clayton...

378
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,552
suffering from ghost fever?

379
00:27:30,553 --> 00:27:32,513
Let my words reach you.

380
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:35,513
Let the flame of love be your balm.

381
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:40,072
Speak to me out of the dark.
I want you out of these woods,
all of you!

382
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:41,792
And out now!

383
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,152
Mr Barnaby, we're conducting
a healing ritual.

384
00:27:44,153 --> 00:27:46,553
Anger has no place
in the circle of the phoenix.

385
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,912
We're expecting a spirit presence.

386
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:52,512
Are you? Yes, well, I'm sorry.

387
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:55,112
But this area really is now
off limits.

388
00:27:55,113 --> 00:27:57,952
So, I'd be very grateful
if you'd all leave.

389
00:27:57,953 --> 00:28:00,953
And I'll arrest you... if you don't.

390
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:06,152
You heard that?

391
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,112
We all heard that!

392
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:09,913
The dead are speaking to me.

393
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,632
You must have heard it, sir.
It was a fox.

394
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:23,192
Or it was a bird or... whatever.

395
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:25,232
It didn't sound like a bird.

396
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:27,272
No, you're right.

397
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,312
It didn't, did it?

398
00:28:29,313 --> 00:28:31,193
No.

399
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:46,153
And who are they?

400
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:01,953
I told you. I don't know!

401
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:13,232
But I would never leave them
to this scum of Corinth. No.

402
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,992
They'll be my very own assassins.

403
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:18,712
They'll take the princess
a gown of silk.

404
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:21,112
A golden crown.

405
00:29:21,113 --> 00:29:25,352
But these, I'll drench
in poison so strong that anyone

406
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:27,913
who touches them will die in agony.

407
00:29:29,673 --> 00:29:31,593
But the thing that tears my heart...

408
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,513
..is what must happen next.

409
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,953
I shall kill my children.
Kill them both.

410
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:42,112
No-one shall save them.

411
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,832
No-one shall own them.

412
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,752
And when I've brought
both Jason and his house

413
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:50,352
to ruin, I shall leave this land.

414
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:52,552
Unnatural woman,

415
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:55,352
flying from the death cries
of my darlings.

416
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,432
From their blood.

417
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:59,313
Their blood.

418
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:02,713
Their blood!

419
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,793
How is it I can bear such guilt...

420
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,513
..but not the laughter
of my enemies?

421
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:31,076
'I thought you said your dog
didn't bite .' 'Whose dog?'

422
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:34,036
'Your dog.'
'Yeah. But that's not my dog.'

423
00:30:34,037 --> 00:30:36,276
12-bore shotgun, apparently.

424
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:37,837
Shot in the back.

425
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,716
- It was Molly Thomas, wasn't it?
- Positive ID from Mr Pargeter, yeah.

426
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,877
Bullard thinks she'd only been dead
a few hours.

427
00:30:46,957 --> 00:30:48,837
So, what do you think?

428
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:52,797
I think that um...

429
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:55,996
She goes for the phone.

430
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:58,036
She doesn't make it.

431
00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:00,076
She pulls the table over.

432
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:02,436
She turns the radio on full blast.

433
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:04,317
To try and attract attention.

434
00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:08,156
I think the effort of...
reaching for the radio

435
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,877
must have finished her off.

436
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:18,077
So, the question is...
how did she get back here?

437
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,436
And where from?

438
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:22,437
And why did she come back?

439
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:25,196
Where's Pargeter now?

440
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:27,077
He went back to The Priory.

441
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:33,517
She was shot in this room,
wasn't she?

442
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,236
And she was shot in the back.

443
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:41,117
She wasn't running away.

444
00:31:42,837 --> 00:31:44,676
It looks as if she was
facing the wall.

445
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:46,756
Whoever killed her...

446
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:50,317
couldn't look her in the face
when they pulled the trigger.

447
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,037
Speak to me...

448
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:04,397
..and I will bring you peace.

449
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,796
To those who worship false gods,

450
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:10,836
I say...

451
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:13,117
'Harken and tremble...

452
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:16,996
..you root of all evil,
you author of pain,

453
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:18,517
you begetter of death!

454
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:22,836
You will be cast out
with every Satanic power,

455
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:25,436
with every unclean spirit,

456
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:28,276
and your voice will be stilled
and your hand will be stayed,

457
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:29,677
and your eye will be blind.

458
00:32:30,277 --> 00:32:31,837
TURN from your way of darkness!

459
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:34,117
TURN from the devil's paths!

460
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:37,316
Or you must suffer
the torments of hell

461
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:38,957
through all eternity!'

462
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,797
Well?

463
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,436
That was my rehearsal for Sunday.

464
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:52,036
Oh. I'm sorry, Wallace.

465
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,957
I wasn't really listening.

466
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:02,756
So, you were out walking,
Mr Pargeter. Am I right?

467
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:05,116
- Yes.
- In the woods.

468
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:07,236
They are my woods, Barnaby.

469
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,917
So, you're not put off
by talk of ghosts.

470
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,556
I frequently walk there.

471
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,676
I've come to no harm.
But you've seen the lights?

472
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:16,836
Heard strange cries?

473
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:18,477
From time to time.

474
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:22,876
My family have lived with these
phenomena for many, many years.

475
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:26,036
If there are ghosts, it would seem
I've come to terms with them.

476
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,036
So, you're coming back
from your walk...

477
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:30,156
you hear the radio...

478
00:33:30,157 --> 00:33:32,476
you go into the cottage
and you find Mrs Thomas?

479
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,876
Yes.
You didn't see anyone?

480
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:36,996
Hear a car driving away?

481
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,996
The place was... deserted.

482
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,716
Just... Molly Thomas lying there.

483
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:44,477
And erm... the radio on.

484
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,196
You're quite a collector,
Mr Pargeter.

485
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:50,676
In a small way.

486
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:52,716
Mostly pieces acquired by my family.

487
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:54,356
Of course, some of them have gone

488
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,916
to my least favourite charities

489
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,836
My ex-wives.

490
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,356
Also collectors, in their way

491
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:05,197
So, you've got er... valuable
antiques here, family heirlooms.

492
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:09,116
And no alarm system.
I did have one.

493
00:34:09,117 --> 00:34:11,676
It tended to go off
three or four times a week.

494
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,077
For no good reason.

495
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:17,596
Stanley and Nesta Goodfellow
kept an eye on things.

496
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,197
Yes, but they're not here now,
are they, Mr Pargeter?

497
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:25,316
Two murders, three people missing.
Don't you think

498
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:28,356
you'd be safer staying at the pub
in Beau Clayton?

499
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,317
But there's no alarm, Barnaby,
as you pointed out.

500
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:34,157
And all these valuable things.

501
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:36,477
As you said.

502
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,757
Did you see that?
Indeed, I did.

503
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:54,197
I think, Jones...

504
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,156
..whatever is in those woods...

505
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:01,676
it's time we met it face to face.

506
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:03,756
Come on.

507
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:05,716
Do ghosts have faces?

508
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,836
Oh, I think they do, yes.

509
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,717
Except the headless ones

510
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:52,197
- Stay close.
- I will

511
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:55,677
Did you hear that?

512
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:59,716
Where's that coming from?

513
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:01,796
I think it came from over there.

514
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:04,516
Ah. There's an echo, isn't there?

515
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:06,197
Hard to tell.

516
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:16,876
Jones! Where are you?

517
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:18,996
I'm here, sir!

518
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:20,956
Where are YOU?

519
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:22,876
Sir?

520
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:24,757
Jones?

521
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:30,837
Sir.

522
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:05,917
Are you there, sir?

523
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:15,116
Aargh!

524
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:17,356
Jones?!

525
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:19,477
Aargh!

526
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:30,877
Aargh!

527
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,597
Who's there?!

528
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:11,516
Sir!
Aargh!

529
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:13,956
Jones.
I heard you call for help.

530
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:15,996
I did not call for help.

531
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:19,037
I was attacked... by an owl.

532
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,316
I saw something.
What?

533
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:25,717
I don't know. Well, whatever it was,
Jones, it was not a ghost.

534
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:30,397
Someone has been tracking me.
But now I am the tracker.

535
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,797
Come on.

536
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:51,036
Stanley?

537
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:53,557
It's Stanley Goodfellow.

538
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:24,556
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr McKay.

539
00:40:24,557 --> 00:40:26,036
Mr Barnaby.
Yes.

540
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:28,236
I'm Mary McKay.

541
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:29,957
Stanley's upstairs. This way.
Thank you.

542
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:37,396
Stanley is suffering from
dissociative trauma.

543
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:39,996
He experienced something
so terrifying,

544
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:42,196
his mind has simply
closed down on him.

545
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:44,556
It's a defence mechanism, of course.

546
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:46,636
Well, at the moment,
Stanley Goodfellow

547
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:49,356
is the only man who can solve
the disappearance of his wife

548
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:51,116
and two other people.

549
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:52,916
My problem is...

550
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,437
he can't speak.

551
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:59,396
Well... he's not saying
anything anyone can understand.

552
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:02,716
Words are a danger
to Stanley just now.

553
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,876
His subconscious is telling him

554
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:07,036
to reject speech because...

555
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:09,437
whatever happened to him
lies beyond description.

556
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,476
Well, when will he be um...?

557
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:15,996
He's lost touch with reality,
Mr Barnaby - we just can't say

558
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:19,036
when he'll want to return,
if ever.

559
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:20,837
Oh. Excuse me.

560
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:25,196
Jones?
Mystery body in the woods, sir.

561
00:41:25,197 --> 00:41:27,156
Positive ID from The Met.

562
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:29,516
Terence Paul Lowther.

563
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:31,636
Part of a well-organised
London gang

564
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:33,836
that specialise in nicking antiques.

565
00:41:33,837 --> 00:41:36,556
Good work.
I'm just leaving The Pines now.

566
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:38,236
Nothing yet from
Stanley Goodfellow.

567
00:41:38,237 --> 00:41:40,836
- Well if you're on your way back...
- I'll pick you up.

568
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:43,476
I want to go down to the village,
pick up on the local gossip.

569
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:44,916
OK. We'll talk then.

570
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:47,277
Bye.

571
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:53,877
Your details, please?

572
00:41:58,237 --> 00:42:00,956
Gail...? Are you free this evening?

573
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:03,396
After work? For a chat.

574
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,476
Yeah. Where shall we go?

575
00:42:05,477 --> 00:42:07,276
Oh, a pub.
Yeah.

576
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:09,117
Yeah, lovely.

577
00:42:42,557 --> 00:42:44,837
- And here endeth...
- The first lesson

578
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,357
And here beginneth the second

579
00:42:58,637 --> 00:43:02,876
The Met said Lowther could be
linked to half a dozen robberies
involving antiques.

580
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:05,516
That antique shop fellow.
John Temple?

581
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:08,956
What did he say about the Netski?
He reckoned it was worth about ã100.

582
00:43:08,957 --> 00:43:10,876
Said it was modern -
nothing special.

583
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:14,116
Did he? Meaning...?
Maybe he was conning her into
selling it for a song.

584
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:17,916
You know. In either case, it must
have been taken from The Priory.

585
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,916
Why didn't Pargeter...
report the theft?

586
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:23,236
See that?
Yeah.

587
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:24,997
I'll follow you in.
Yeah, OK.

588
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:31,037
Excuse me. Could I...?

589
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:39,317
This village is ghost crazy,
if you ask me. There you go, mate.

590
00:43:40,477 --> 00:43:42,717
Oh, look out. Here's the law.
Hello, Mr Nelms.

591
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:45,716
A man of leisure, thanks to you lot.

592
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:49,556
Gardening leave.
Don't let me interrupt you, sir.

593
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:52,997
Carry on. What were you saying?
That something weird's going on.

594
00:43:54,077 --> 00:43:55,516
But spirits?

595
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:57,637
Spooks? I don't think so.

596
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:03,677
Shall we sit and wait for them
to come outside? Jones.

597
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,037
Detective Chief Inspector.
Mr Pargeter.

598
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:14,156
I was intending to come to see you.
I heard.

599
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:17,596
You did? About what?
Stanley Goodfellow. You found him.

600
00:44:17,597 --> 00:44:19,796
Yes, indeed. In your woods.

601
00:44:19,797 --> 00:44:21,797
Is it true that he's lost his mind?

602
00:44:22,957 --> 00:44:25,236
He's under medical supervision
just now.

603
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:28,236
I'm hoping to be able
to speak to him in due course.

604
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:31,237
But er... this is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

605
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:36,397
Ah, yes. Yes.

606
00:44:37,557 --> 00:44:40,516
It was supposed to be delivered
to the Goodfellows.

607
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:42,996
Not really their thing.
We wondered if they were

608
00:44:42,997 --> 00:44:44,836
taking it in for you.
No. No, no.

609
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:46,716
This has no great value.

610
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,676
It's... nice enough.

611
00:44:48,677 --> 00:44:51,796
I'm going to an antiques fair
in France

612
00:44:51,797 --> 00:44:53,476
for a couple of days.

613
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:56,796
I'd be grateful if the police could
watch The Priory while I'm away.

614
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:59,596
Mr Pargeter,
two murders have been committed.

615
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,516
Both bodies were found on your land.

616
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:05,357
A visit to France...
out of the question.

617
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,316
This is outrageous.
I have business to attend to.

618
00:45:10,317 --> 00:45:13,357
Friend of yours?
Who?

619
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:15,477
Jones.

620
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:14,837
- Not his netsuke, then?
- Oh, no

621
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:18,516
Of course it is.
He's up to something.

622
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:20,716
Are we mobile yet?

623
00:46:20,717 --> 00:46:23,156
Pit-stop wheel change, sir.
Oh, good.

624
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:25,596
Time in the Traffic Division
not wasted, then

625
00:46:25,597 --> 00:46:27,916
Thank you.

626
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:30,477
Exorcizamus te...

627
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,036
..omnis incursio

628
00:46:34,037 --> 00:46:36,517
infernalis adversarii...

629
00:46:38,557 --> 00:46:40,596
..omnis legio,

630
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,796
omnis congregatio,

631
00:46:42,797 --> 00:46:45,276
et secta diabolica!

632
00:46:45,277 --> 00:46:47,037
Jesu Christi!

633
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:57,516
I adjure you, Satan.

634
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,556
Yield now to God.

635
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:01,757
Depart, accursed one!

636
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:05,396
Depart, foul fiend!

637
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:07,317
Depart -

638
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:19,110
If there ARE restless souls
in these woods,

639
00:48:19,111 --> 00:48:21,470
they are the souls of godly men.

640
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:24,950
And it is the work of God's minister
to bring them deliverance.

641
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:26,951
And you saw no-one.
No.

642
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:28,991
Just...

643
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:34,191
Sitting up in his grave
as if it were... judgment day.

644
00:48:38,071 --> 00:48:42,391
Gases. Post-mortem gases, causing
expansion and consequent movement.

645
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,790
- It sometimes happens in the morgue.
- Really?

646
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:47,671
A body rising under a sheet.

647
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:50,270
He was buried.

648
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:53,551
It was a shallow grave,
like the other victim.
He was barely covered in earth.

649
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,750
Whoever buried him
must've been in a hurry.

650
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:00,591
Or didn't have the tools
to do the job. Do we know who he is?

651
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:03,910
Yes. It's Colin Thomas.

652
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:06,910
Positive ID from Stephens.
Cause of death, George.

653
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,231
Shotgun wound.
12-bore, by the look of it.

654
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:13,950
So, we've got two people dead,
one mad, one still missing.

655
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,990
Why these people?

656
00:49:15,991 --> 00:49:17,550
What was it about them

657
00:49:17,551 --> 00:49:18,951
that made them the victims, eh?

658
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:22,750
There's something
we're still not seeing.

659
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,151
Right. Let's start again. Let's have
another look round the cottages.

660
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,271
Sir!

661
00:49:57,151 --> 00:50:00,470
Ticket to Florida
in the name of Nesta Goodfellow.

662
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:03,350
With a note.
Saying...? See you at the airport.

663
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:06,631
Is that note signed?
Sex bomb.

664
00:50:08,151 --> 00:50:09,551
Our over-eager postman?

665
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:12,391
I wonder if her husband knew.

666
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:19,631
What?
Someone's in there!

667
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:27,671
Oi! Hey... hey!

668
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:53,470
Don't kill him, sir!
He'll kill himself if he carries on.

669
00:50:53,471 --> 00:50:55,031
How fast is he going?

670
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:16,110
He'll come out over
on the Beau Clayton road, won't he?

671
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:17,831
Whoa!

672
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:25,550
Lost him!

673
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,871
Not necessarily.

674
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:40,671
Take a look round the back.

675
00:51:49,951 --> 00:51:52,910
Please don't say it was a hunch.
Observation.

676
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,911
Saw it first time we called.
Didn't you?

677
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:02,950
Make sure he doesn't
jump out of the back window

678
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:04,871
and escape or something.

679
00:52:15,151 --> 00:52:16,751
Muddy ride, was it

680
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:20,070
Did you find anything?

681
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:22,031
No.

682
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:26,070
A few coins in a jar.

683
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,950
Thought they might have other
bits and pieces hidden away.

684
00:52:28,951 --> 00:52:32,270
Why were they hidden?
They were at it.

685
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:34,790
Nicking stuff up at The Priory.

686
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,550
A little nick here,
a little nick there.

687
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:40,430
You had a look around
in the Goodfellows' cottage as well.

688
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:43,471
Didn't you? Did you see
anything you fancied in there?

689
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:47,311
You can't get a 40-inch
plasma screen on a mountain bike.

690
00:52:49,111 --> 00:52:52,950
'I am the way and the truth
and the life, ' says the Lord.

691
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:56,110
For tempters and blasphemers abound.

692
00:52:56,111 --> 00:52:59,191
And those who love evil
are in our midst.

693
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:04,390
The times are out of joint...

694
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:08,070
where wrongdoers prosper
and the spawn of Satan multiplies.

695
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:10,870
Where the virtue finds no respect.

696
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:14,550
For who does not know that,
in the face of such evil,
it takes a man of courage

697
00:53:14,551 --> 00:53:20,111
to stand up unafraid and say,
'I am for divine justice
and retribution'?

698
00:53:51,191 --> 00:53:53,031
Stanley.

699
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,790
Did you know, Stanley...

700
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:07,110
that Nesta... was getting ready
to run off and leave you?

701
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,030
I wonder if you...

702
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:10,911
I wonder if you knew that.

703
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:31,350
You hold the key... Stanley.

704
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,551
Somewhere inside. Sorry.

705
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:39,271
What happened to you, eh?

706
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:51,030
The number plate of that SUV
was on the computer.

707
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:53,151
Stolen from an address in Chelsea
a week ago.

708
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,270
Right. Let Chelsea know
it's been spotted here.

709
00:54:58,271 --> 00:55:01,431
And get our Traffic Division
to watch out for it. Yes, Sarge.

710
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:12,310
I don't know why you're coming.
You said you think he's a fake.

711
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:14,830
Well, he's a prime suspect,
for starters, Joyce.

712
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:17,950
It's a bit odd,
him suddenly turning up in Midsomer.

713
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:21,310
A bit opportune, don't you think?
Maybe all this psychic drivel

714
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:23,870
is a cover for something
more sinister.

715
00:55:23,871 --> 00:55:27,310
Don't be ridiculous. Why on earth
should he want to kill anyone?

716
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:29,031
Give him someone to talk to.

717
00:55:30,951 --> 00:55:33,550
The powers with which
I have been gifted

718
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:35,790
led me to the grave of a man

719
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:39,111
who'd fallen victim
to the forces of evil.

720
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:44,070
I intend to use these same powers...

721
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:45,951
to envision the whereabouts...

722
00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:49,110
..of a missing woman.

723
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:51,590
Nesta Goodfellow.

724
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:53,830
I'm so glad I came Shh!

725
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:55,911
The knife of light
will point the way.

726
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:03,631
I shall fall into a trance...

727
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,790
..and concentrate on
the strong psychic projection

728
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:10,150
of her fear.

729
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:13,430
I shall seek her out
in the dark night

730
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:15,431
of her distress.

731
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:24,070
Aargh!

732
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:26,310
I can see her!

733
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:28,191
Agh!

734
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:32,830
She lies... beneath
the sign of the witch.

735
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,070
Oh!

736
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,831
Of the witch!

737
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,911
For goodness sake. Come on!

738
00:56:46,471 --> 00:56:49,990
I mean, to talk to the dead!
How stupid is that?

739
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:53,550
I mean, what is the point
of talking to someone

740
00:56:53,551 --> 00:56:55,990
who is incapable of listening?
You might do worse

741
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:59,470
than follow up on what he said!
Oh, you mean, the inspired vision?

742
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:01,510
Well, look. Let's see.

743
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:03,750
A dark place, he says.

744
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:06,350
Three people have died,
two buried in shallow graves.

745
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:08,710
Of course he talks about
a dark place!

746
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:10,830
And the sign of the witch?

747
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:14,030
Witches.
Stock in trade of the phoney psychic.

748
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,110
Witches are bound to be
top of the agenda.

749
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:17,750
He fainted!
Of course he did.

750
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:19,631
And how theatrical that was.

751
00:58:11,431 --> 00:58:13,351
It's fine. All clear.

752
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:16,311
Right.

753
01:01:04,671 --> 01:01:07,230
I got your message.
YES... Jones.

754
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:09,510
Sorry, sir. Are you all right?

755
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:13,430
Of course I'm all right.
I didn't expect you to ambush me.
What happened?

756
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:17,270
Pargeter and the others loaded some
furniture in the SUV and drove off.

757
01:01:17,271 --> 01:01:18,950
That's why he had to
stay in the house.

758
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:21,110
Half those antiques he's got there?

759
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:23,790
Stolen. He's still in there.
Good chance to nab him.

760
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:27,390
No. We should wait.
He doesn't know we're onto him.

761
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:29,431
And I don't want to scare off
the delivery boys.

762
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:34,030
Did it occur to you to follow them?

763
01:01:34,031 --> 01:01:36,190
I made a quick phone call.

764
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:37,951
They won't be looking for
a woman driver.

765
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:28,854
Uh-huh.

766
01:02:28,855 --> 01:02:30,735
I see.

767
01:02:32,775 --> 01:02:35,415
And you're absolutely certain.

768
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:38,935
OK. Thank you.

769
01:02:42,415 --> 01:02:45,574
Morning, Jones.
Morning, sir. Call from the lab.

770
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:49,054
Blood in the Goodfellows' cottage?
Definitely not Colin Thomas's.

771
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:50,774
Not?
Nope.

772
01:02:50,775 --> 01:02:53,414
So, it's not Lowther's
and it's not Colin Thomas's.

773
01:02:53,415 --> 01:02:55,414
That poses a few questions.
Yeah.

774
01:02:55,415 --> 01:02:57,946
And Pargeter's got
more than a few to answer.

775
01:02:57,947 --> 01:03:00,094
- Where are you going?
- Well, I thought we were...

776
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,174
No, no, no.

777
01:03:02,175 --> 01:03:04,655
I think we give Pargeter and Temple
a little more rope.

778
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,775
Come on.

779
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:14,454
Maybe if we get off the track...
Maybe what?

780
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:16,335
Of course... I could be wrong.

781
01:03:17,415 --> 01:03:19,335
Surely not

782
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,654
And after the news
here on Radio Causton,

783
01:03:27,655 --> 01:03:31,654
we'll be talking to psychic
and ghost hunter Cyrus LeVanu,

784
01:03:31,655 --> 01:03:34,734
whose latest book Talking To
The Dead has just been published,

785
01:03:34,735 --> 01:03:38,614
and asking him about
his recent sensational experiences

786
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:41,615
in the famously haunted
Monksbarton Woods.

787
01:03:50,295 --> 01:03:52,255
Yes.

788
01:03:56,455 --> 01:03:58,455
Ooh! That was close.

789
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:01,855
We're getting near.

790
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,415
Gotcha!

791
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,174
That sound you're hearing, Jones.

792
01:04:16,175 --> 01:04:19,614
It's the sound of
a radio signal being blocked.

793
01:04:19,615 --> 01:04:21,335
Somewhere...

794
01:04:22,415 --> 01:04:24,495
..up in that tree.

795
01:04:30,455 --> 01:04:32,375
Well, it's not gonna be me.

796
01:04:36,895 --> 01:04:38,815
Fine.

797
01:05:23,215 --> 01:05:25,175
Jones? We've got another one here.
Oh!

798
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:38,935
Ah! There you are.

799
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:44,255
What have you got?

800
01:05:46,455 --> 01:05:48,814
Ah.

801
01:05:48,815 --> 01:05:52,494
I think we'll find
this little gizmo is well stocked
with mysterious noises.

802
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:54,894
And I reckon we'll find
a few others like this,

803
01:05:54,895 --> 01:05:57,054
courtesy of Cyrus LeVanu.

804
01:05:57,055 --> 01:05:58,694
How did you know?
How?

805
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:01,494
Well... last night,
after my car got stuck,

806
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:03,814
I had to walk about half a mile
through these woods.

807
01:06:03,815 --> 01:06:06,014
I could hear the cries and I knew

808
01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:08,414
there must be some sort of
rational explanation.

809
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:12,094
And I thought how convenient
all this was for Cyrus LeVanu.

810
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:16,614
Obviously, the woods weren't full
of his supporter stooges
whispering on cue.

811
01:06:16,615 --> 01:06:19,654
And then I thought I heard
this buzzing sound.

812
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:21,455
Aagh!
And I...

813
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:25,334
You all right, Jones?
I'm absolutely fine, sir.

814
01:06:25,335 --> 01:06:27,054
Thanks for asking.
Well, come on.

815
01:06:27,055 --> 01:06:31,014
And then I thought,
it's not ectoplasmic eruption
we're talking about here.

816
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:33,174
It's radio waves.

817
01:06:33,175 --> 01:06:35,774
And then you found the body.
I mean...

818
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:38,774
Wow! That must have been
one hell of a shock, wasn't it?

819
01:06:38,775 --> 01:06:41,455
Not if, like me, you've been gifted
with special powers.

820
01:06:47,175 --> 01:06:49,334
Gail... Oh, yeah?

821
01:06:49,335 --> 01:06:50,814
On now?

822
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:52,774
Thanks for letting me know.

823
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,494
What's that?

824
01:06:54,495 --> 01:06:56,654
This.

825
01:06:56,655 --> 01:07:00,614
My last meeting
was a complete sellout,
so I will hold another one.

826
01:07:00,615 --> 01:07:03,094
Tonight at Beau Clayton Town Hall.

827
01:07:03,095 --> 01:07:05,574
And, although there are those
who would prevent me,

828
01:07:05,575 --> 01:07:09,294
I've every intention of returning
to Monksbarton Woods.

829
01:07:09,295 --> 01:07:12,334
Where you'll be...
Talking To The Dead!

830
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:15,334
Well, that's all we've got time for,
so a big thank you to our guest,

831
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:17,574
the psychic adventurer, Cyrus Leva-

832
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,974
Where's our
'psychic adventurer' staying?

833
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:22,134
Er, The Monk's Retreat.

834
01:07:22,135 --> 01:07:24,614
I shall go there.
I want you to go to Temple Antiques.

835
01:07:24,615 --> 01:07:27,255
For whatever was shipped over there
last night. Yeah.

836
01:07:30,535 --> 01:07:31,695
Oh!

837
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:41,774
Local radio shows might
seem small beer for someone like me.

838
01:07:41,775 --> 01:07:45,254
There you go.
But er... the most important thing

839
01:07:45,255 --> 01:07:47,254
is to get the message across.

840
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:49,294
Loud and clear.

841
01:07:49,295 --> 01:07:52,335
Loud and clear, Mr LeVanu!

842
01:07:53,495 --> 01:07:55,415
Like the signals
from your transmitters.

843
01:07:57,135 --> 01:07:59,894
Barnaby, what are you talking about?

844
01:07:59,895 --> 01:08:03,814
Do you not know, Mr LeVanu? I'm
talking about the mysterious cries

845
01:08:03,815 --> 01:08:05,974
in Monksbarton Woods.

846
01:08:05,975 --> 01:08:09,134
But, of course,
there is a logical explanation.

847
01:08:09,135 --> 01:08:11,734
As you well know.
Where do you transmit from?

848
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:13,614
Your room here?

849
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:15,574
Your car?

850
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:17,774
Or do you have an accomplice,
who helps you

851
01:08:17,775 --> 01:08:19,934
with your special effects?

852
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:22,214
I've never seen this object before
in my life.

853
01:08:22,215 --> 01:08:24,374
What I find offensive
about people like you,

854
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:28,054
Mr LeVanu, is that you
feed off other people's anxieties.

855
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:31,175
And their pain.
You trade on their weaknesses.

856
01:08:33,135 --> 01:08:36,014
Ooh! Listen to that.
How spooky is that?

857
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:38,095
Frightened me to death

858
01:08:53,415 --> 01:08:56,414
Detective Inspector Jones,
isn't it? Sergeant.

859
01:08:56,415 --> 01:08:58,694
I was wondering if you'd had
any more contact

860
01:08:58,695 --> 01:09:01,614
with Mrs Smith, the woman who -

861
01:09:01,615 --> 01:09:04,534
Brought in the Netski.
No. I did agree to phone if I -

862
01:09:04,535 --> 01:09:07,415
Yes. I was just passing and
thought it just as easy to pop in.

863
01:09:08,655 --> 01:09:10,535
Will you excuse me?

864
01:09:14,295 --> 01:09:16,294
Hello?

865
01:09:16,295 --> 01:09:19,134
Yes... Yes.

866
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:22,055
Erm... Yes. I think we'd agreed
the fourth of April.

867
01:09:24,055 --> 01:09:25,895
Well, you could bring it in
in the morning.

868
01:09:36,415 --> 01:09:37,695
Oh, Gail.

869
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:42,654
There's pictures on here
of some items of furniture.

870
01:09:42,655 --> 01:09:45,134
Let's see if Art and Antiques
can recognise something.

871
01:09:45,135 --> 01:09:47,255
Right... Sarge?

872
01:09:48,855 --> 01:09:51,574
Are we still on?
It's just that, last night -

873
01:09:51,575 --> 01:09:53,374
You were on extra duty.

874
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:54,815
Of course.

875
01:09:57,895 --> 01:09:59,135
Gail.

876
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:02,495
Gail?

877
01:10:03,695 --> 01:10:05,415
Look...

878
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,415
What?

879
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:13,615
No workplace involvements.

880
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:17,094
It's just tough to have a...

881
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:20,095
proper working relationship if...
we also have...

882
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:24,015
..a relationship.
You think so?

883
01:10:27,735 --> 01:10:29,975
It's never been a problem for me
in the past.

884
01:10:59,175 --> 01:11:02,615
Vile and untruthful accusations
have been made against me.

885
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:06,014
Those whom I considered steadfast

886
01:11:06,015 --> 01:11:07,895
have abandoned me.

887
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,734
Even thrown aside their belief.

888
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:14,254
No, it's you they've thrown aside.
Why?

889
01:11:14,255 --> 01:11:16,894
Because you've been exposed
as a liar and a cheat.

890
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:19,134
That's slanderous!
Not if it's the truth.

891
01:11:19,135 --> 01:11:22,214
And it is,
which is why your slavish followers

892
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:25,334
have abandoned you.
I never put transmitters in trees.

893
01:11:25,335 --> 01:11:27,454
No, of course not

894
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:29,655
Now everyone's seen you
in your true colours...

895
01:11:30,695 --> 01:11:33,414
..why don't you pack up your tricks

896
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:35,494
and your hocus-pocus and leave?

897
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:37,495
Leave?

898
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,920
I won't be leaving.

899
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:43,254
I will be returning
to Monksbarton Wood

900
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:45,662
in the hope of bringing peace
to souls in torment.

901
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,054
Poison, LeVanu.
Your fake philosophy is poison.

902
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:49,815
Your ridiculous rituals are poison.

903
01:11:51,615 --> 01:11:53,535
You are poison.

904
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:56,732
Jones.

905
01:12:56,733 --> 01:13:00,572
Sir. Quick response from the photos
I took at Temple Antiques.

906
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:03,813
Four items definitely stolen,
two suspected.

907
01:13:04,893 --> 01:13:07,012
The table with the water stain

908
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:08,972
is part of a haul
from a house in Devon.

909
01:13:08,973 --> 01:13:13,452
The Devon Police are pretty sure
a London gang was involved.

910
01:13:13,453 --> 01:13:15,572
They turned them over,
but no result.

911
01:13:15,573 --> 01:13:18,812
So, the stuff must have gone to
a receiver the next day.

912
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:22,012
Pargeter fences it to dealers.
Including John Temple.

913
01:13:22,013 --> 01:13:24,212
He's got the outlets -
here and abroad.

914
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:27,212
That's why he wanted to go to
the antiques fair in France.

915
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:28,813
The SUV guys are his distributors.

916
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:33,333
Now all we have to do...
is find the murderer.

917
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,452
Barnaby.

918
01:13:38,453 --> 01:13:40,572
You checked house and garden?
Thoroughly.

919
01:13:40,573 --> 01:13:43,612
He's not here. I'm sure of that.
You said you found a weapon.

920
01:13:43,613 --> 01:13:45,373
Ah, yes. Here.

921
01:13:49,453 --> 01:13:51,253
Has anyone touched it?
No.

922
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:54,532
There's blood on the blade.

923
01:13:54,533 --> 01:13:56,093
What kind of a knife is it?

924
01:13:57,213 --> 01:13:59,093
It's er... a kris.

925
01:14:01,293 --> 01:14:03,533
It's a collector's item.
An antique?

926
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:09,332
Got backup?
On the way.

927
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,532
He's here, all right.

928
01:14:11,533 --> 01:14:14,053
It's time to put the screws
on Mr Lynton Pargeter.

929
01:14:15,213 --> 01:14:17,252
Let's hurry.

930
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:19,412
Right.

931
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:22,053
Take the upstairs rooms.
I'll look down here. And be careful.

932
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:36,452
I heard one of those cries.
Yes, I know.

933
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:38,532
It was me.

934
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:40,293
Take a look at that.

935
01:15:41,533 --> 01:15:45,052
We have seriously misjudged
Cyrus LeVanu. It was Pargeter,

936
01:15:45,053 --> 01:15:48,772
not LeVanu, responsible for those
strange noises in the woods.

937
01:15:48,773 --> 01:15:50,852
His way of keeping the locals out

938
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:52,972
while he took delivery
of stolen goods.

939
01:15:52,973 --> 01:15:56,252
And the mysterious lights...
must have been from the vans.

940
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:58,452
Delivering the dodgy antiques.

941
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,852
Well, he's packed a case,
so it seems he'll be back.

942
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:03,173
Oh, he will. Airline ticket.

943
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,013
Guess where to.
Florida. Yep.

944
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:10,612
Pargeter and Nesta Goodfellow?

945
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:12,853
What's that?

946
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,253
Jones?

947
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:13,132
In the woods, behind The Priory.

948
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:15,613
Behind The Priory!
Into the woods.

949
01:17:24,213 --> 01:17:25,533
Come on, quick!

950
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,213
All right? Straight through!

951
01:17:44,613 --> 01:17:46,612
Gone.

952
01:17:46,613 --> 01:17:48,492
Yeah. Gone to ground.

953
01:17:48,493 --> 01:17:49,933
Come on.

954
01:18:27,093 --> 01:18:30,172
How long can you keep this up,
Stanley?

955
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:32,613
Another week?

956
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:39,172
- Oh, very good, Stanley.
- It's very good

957
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,213
Had me fooled.

958
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:47,372
Where is she, Stanley?

959
01:18:47,373 --> 01:18:49,253
Where is Nesta?

960
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,493
Stay with him.

961
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,773
Dear God. Nesta?!

962
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:28,573
Jones?!

963
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:58,022
I'm going to talk...

964
01:19:58,023 --> 01:20:01,217
to Mr Goodfellow
whilst you pay Mr Temple a visit.

965
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:03,623
Yes, sir.

966
01:20:21,303 --> 01:20:23,302
Once it started...

967
01:20:23,303 --> 01:20:25,822
no going back.

968
01:20:25,823 --> 01:20:28,702
Pargeter was a fence,
a receiver of stolen goods.

969
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:31,182
You knew that.

970
01:20:31,183 --> 01:20:33,302
And he knew you knew.

971
01:20:33,303 --> 01:20:35,502
We could see what he was up to.

972
01:20:35,503 --> 01:20:37,702
What could he do?

973
01:20:37,703 --> 01:20:39,622
If we didn't take too much,
he didn't worry.

974
01:20:39,623 --> 01:20:41,503
All of you?

975
01:20:42,903 --> 01:20:45,063
Colin and Molly Thomas too?
Colin was up for it.

976
01:20:46,143 --> 01:20:48,382
Molly was unhappy. She...

977
01:20:48,383 --> 01:20:50,542
tried to get him to stop.

978
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:53,102
If she'd succeeded,
he wouldn't have got involved

979
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:54,863
in the murder of Terry Lowther,
would he?

980
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:57,783
I didn't mean to kill him.

981
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:03,622
He broke in.
He knew that Pargeter was in London,
so he didn't expect to see anyone.

982
01:21:03,623 --> 01:21:05,823
And you took him on.

983
01:21:16,023 --> 01:21:18,742
The water stains on
the antique table and the carpet.

984
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:21,022
They were caused
when you mopped up the blood.

985
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:23,743
Mm. Then we buried him in the woods.

986
01:21:26,023 --> 01:21:28,022
But then Colin lost his nerve,
didn't he?

987
01:21:28,023 --> 01:21:29,463
It'll be all right.

988
01:21:31,023 --> 01:21:33,902
How can it be all right? He's dead.

989
01:21:33,903 --> 01:21:35,822
He went home and told Molly.

990
01:21:35,823 --> 01:21:38,782
We've talked it over, Stan.
It's the only thing to do.

991
01:21:38,783 --> 01:21:41,342
They wanted to go to the police.

992
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:44,342
You buried him.
But you killed him.

993
01:21:44,343 --> 01:21:47,703
We hid the body. You think the
police are gonna be understanding?

994
01:21:54,983 --> 01:21:57,383
That's it, Stan.
You can do as you please.

995
01:22:00,343 --> 01:22:01,983
No, Stan. Please. No.

996
01:22:04,423 --> 01:22:06,662
I didn't know what to do.

997
01:22:06,663 --> 01:22:08,543
I wasn't going to prison.
I knew that much.

998
01:22:12,703 --> 01:22:14,902
We was on a good thing,
up there at The Priory.

999
01:22:14,903 --> 01:22:16,503
If only they'd listened to reason.

1000
01:22:20,383 --> 01:22:22,983
I thought I'd keep them
in the woods till they saw sense.

1001
01:22:25,063 --> 01:22:28,503
And then Colin decided
to have another go at me.

1002
01:22:29,863 --> 01:22:32,102
No! No, please!

1003
01:22:32,103 --> 01:22:33,983
Please, stop it! No!

1004
01:22:36,063 --> 01:22:37,943
Colin!

1005
01:22:50,263 --> 01:22:52,262
The thing was...

1006
01:22:52,263 --> 01:22:54,223
I didn't mean to kill him either.

1007
01:22:55,663 --> 01:22:57,622
It was just...
one thing after another.

1008
01:22:57,623 --> 01:22:59,622
You know?

1009
01:22:59,623 --> 01:23:01,903
Just... one thing after another.

1010
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:06,983
You buried Colin Thomas,
just as you buried Terry Lowther.

1011
01:23:08,223 --> 01:23:10,262
I made the women do it.

1012
01:23:10,263 --> 01:23:12,422
Get up!

1013
01:23:12,423 --> 01:23:15,022
I was gonna go back later
and make a proper job of it.

1014
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:18,102
But... I knew I couldn't trust them.

1015
01:23:18,103 --> 01:23:22,822
So... we had to keep moving round
the woods, stay ahead of the police.

1016
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:24,982
But I had to find
somewhere to keep 'em.

1017
01:23:24,983 --> 01:23:26,542
Somewhere safe.

1018
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,743
So you thought of this shack.

1019
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:36,703
Well... I used to work
as a 'keeper on the estate,
before I worked at The Priory.

1020
01:23:37,783 --> 01:23:39,703
I know every inch of these woods.

1021
01:23:40,863 --> 01:23:43,183
But something went wrong,
didn't it, Stanley?

1022
01:23:44,343 --> 01:23:46,703
Molly Thomas somehow managed...
to escape.

1023
01:23:49,183 --> 01:23:51,823
They thought I would kill 'em.
I hadn't thought about it.

1024
01:23:52,983 --> 01:23:54,863
I hadn't thought about
anything much.

1025
01:23:57,143 --> 01:23:59,222
Molly ran indoors.

1026
01:23:59,223 --> 01:24:01,262
I was close behind.

1027
01:24:01,263 --> 01:24:02,822
No. Aargh!

1028
01:24:02,823 --> 01:24:04,623
I saw where she went.

1029
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:32,182
There was nothing for it.

1030
01:24:32,183 --> 01:24:34,743
Well... no way back. Not then.

1031
01:24:37,703 --> 01:24:40,103
But I... I couldn't...

1032
01:24:44,023 --> 01:24:46,343
You couldn't look at her, could you?

1033
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:49,983
Turn round.

1034
01:25:11,103 --> 01:25:14,063
What... what have you done?

1035
01:25:15,663 --> 01:25:18,622
Perhaps I should have
killed Nesta then.

1036
01:25:18,623 --> 01:25:21,223
Yeah. I should have killed her.

1037
01:25:23,263 --> 01:25:24,982
But I didn't.

1038
01:25:24,983 --> 01:25:27,182
The fact is, Stanley,
you very nearly did.

1039
01:25:27,183 --> 01:25:28,823
Well, that was your fault.

1040
01:25:31,983 --> 01:25:34,342
I put her in the well,
keep her out of trouble.

1041
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:37,142
Then you caught me
and she was stuck down there.

1042
01:25:37,143 --> 01:25:40,422
And she must have been down there
when we found you the first time.

1043
01:25:40,423 --> 01:25:42,422
She didn't have the strength
to call out.

1044
01:25:42,423 --> 01:25:44,222
And this is my fault?

1045
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,823
Definitely.

1046
01:25:47,223 --> 01:25:50,502
Oh, yeah. That was down to you.

1047
01:25:50,503 --> 01:25:53,743
Stanley, you could have
told someone where she was.

1048
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:58,662
She was getting ready to leave me.

1049
01:25:58,663 --> 01:26:00,583
I knew that.

1050
01:26:01,663 --> 01:26:03,982
Stealing things to pay for it all.

1051
01:26:03,983 --> 01:26:06,822
Did you know
it was Lynton Pargeter...

1052
01:26:06,823 --> 01:26:08,982
that she was having an affair with?

1053
01:26:08,983 --> 01:26:11,262
Not until he came at me
with a knife.

1054
01:26:11,263 --> 01:26:13,103
I wasn't expecting it.

1055
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:16,742
Otherwise he'd never
have got close enough.

1056
01:26:16,743 --> 01:26:19,343
What have you done, you bastard?
Where's Nesta? Dead?

1057
01:26:23,263 --> 01:26:24,702
Aargh!

1058
01:26:24,703 --> 01:26:26,182
Then it was him...

1059
01:26:26,183 --> 01:26:28,182
or me.

1060
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,342
No choice in the matter.

1061
01:26:30,343 --> 01:26:33,222
You caught up with him
at The Priory.

1062
01:26:33,223 --> 01:26:36,142
What I don't understand
is how you got there so quickly.

1063
01:26:36,143 --> 01:26:38,622
I mean, all he had to do
was grab his case,

1064
01:26:38,623 --> 01:26:40,543
chuck it into a car and he'd be gone.

1065
01:26:41,903 --> 01:26:44,182
I've lived round Beau Clayton
all my life.

1066
01:26:44,183 --> 01:26:46,263
I know every track, every shortcut.

1067
01:26:47,343 --> 01:26:49,942
His bad luck. He got back first.

1068
01:26:49,943 --> 01:26:51,503
But I came across the fields.

1069
01:26:54,623 --> 01:26:56,543
He wasn't quick enough.

1070
01:27:37,183 --> 01:27:39,023
No! Aaaargh!

1071
01:27:48,623 --> 01:27:50,982
John Temple is very anxious
to co-operate.

1072
01:27:50,983 --> 01:27:55,223
Is he? Shouldn't be long before
we find Pargeter's delivery men.

1073
01:27:56,383 --> 01:27:58,222
Was he...
Forthcoming?

1074
01:27:58,223 --> 01:28:00,062
Yes.

1075
01:28:00,063 --> 01:28:01,702
Surprisingly so.

1076
01:28:01,703 --> 01:28:04,703
Except... perhaps not such a surprise.

1077
01:28:05,943 --> 01:28:08,862
Sir?
He could have been miles away

1078
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:12,222
by the time we found the body.
Yet, when we chased him,

1079
01:28:12,223 --> 01:28:14,302
where does he come?
He comes back here.

1080
01:28:14,303 --> 01:28:16,063
Where we found him
in the first place.

1081
01:28:17,503 --> 01:28:19,702
Perhaps he wanted to be caught.

1082
01:28:19,703 --> 01:28:21,703
Perhaps he wanted her to be found.

1083
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:25,503
See? It's all your fault, really.

1084
01:28:29,543 --> 01:28:31,662
Still doing his mad act, then?

1085
01:28:31,663 --> 01:28:33,863
I'm not sure he's acting. Not now.

1086
01:28:35,103 --> 01:28:37,183
A horseshoe over water.

1087
01:28:38,783 --> 01:28:41,102
A witch's sign,
my Welsh granny used to say.

1088
01:28:41,103 --> 01:28:42,982
She's in a dark place.
It's dark.

1089
01:28:42,983 --> 01:28:45,182
She cannot speak, she cannot see.

1090
01:28:45,183 --> 01:28:48,423
She lies... beneath
the sign of the witch!

1091
01:28:51,223 --> 01:28:53,183
No. It's nonsense.

1092
01:29:00,383 --> 01:29:02,742
I preached to the people, Sarah.

1093
01:29:02,743 --> 01:29:04,782
Now the truth has been heard.

1094
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:06,583
The blasphemer is unmasked.

1095
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:09,982
Sarah?
I'm sorry, Wallace.

1096
01:29:09,983 --> 01:29:11,783
I've had enough.

1097
01:29:13,183 --> 01:29:16,462
What do you mean?
I don't understand. No.

1098
01:29:16,463 --> 01:29:18,343
Of course you don't.

1099
01:29:20,863 --> 01:29:23,022
Surely it's too late
for the postman.

1100
01:29:23,023 --> 01:29:25,102
No.

1101
01:29:25,103 --> 01:29:27,143
Perfect timing.

1102
01:29:36,103 --> 01:29:38,302
So, it was your fault.

1103
01:29:38,303 --> 01:29:40,342
What was my fault?
It was your fault

1104
01:29:40,343 --> 01:29:43,302
that LeVanu was accused of fraud.
He is a fraud.

1105
01:29:43,303 --> 01:29:45,782
You're such a cynic.
Joyce...

1106
01:29:45,783 --> 01:29:49,702
people like ghost stories,
they enjoy being scared.

1107
01:29:49,703 --> 01:29:51,622
It's basic human nature.

1108
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:53,382
You don't believe it all, do you?

1109
01:29:53,383 --> 01:29:56,262
Well, why not? I have an open mind.

1110
01:29:56,263 --> 01:29:58,302
Unlike some people.

1111
01:29:58,303 --> 01:30:00,183
Hm. All right.

1112
01:30:03,943 --> 01:30:04,943
Come on.

1113
01:30:06,343 --> 01:30:08,702
I don't care how you rationalise it.

1114
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:10,982
There's definitely
something spooky here.

1115
01:30:10,983 --> 01:30:12,782
Yeah. Well, so people say.

1116
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:15,262
Accounts of the mass murder
in Monksbarton Woods

1117
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:17,982
have been handed down
from generation to generation.

1118
01:30:17,983 --> 01:30:21,942
There is a theory that the very
stones of The Priory, even the earth,

1119
01:30:21,943 --> 01:30:23,662
where the victims fell,

1120
01:30:23,663 --> 01:30:26,782
is imprinted with psychic recordings
of those terrible events.

1121
01:30:26,783 --> 01:30:30,222
And Cyrus LeVanu
traded on that theory.

1122
01:30:30,223 --> 01:30:33,982
I was wrong about LeVanu
just in one respect.

1123
01:30:33,983 --> 01:30:36,502
It was Pargeter,
not LeVanu, who put...

1124
01:30:36,503 --> 01:30:40,982
speakers in the trees to scare off...
the locals. Right.

1125
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:44,223
Let's see if we can summon up...
a ghostly presence for you.

1126
01:30:46,063 --> 01:30:47,903
Joyce?

1127
01:30:48,983 --> 01:30:49,983
Joyce?

1128
01:30:53,543 --> 01:30:55,463
Joyce. What is it? Are you all right?

1129
01:30:56,623 --> 01:31:00,583
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

1130
01:31:15,423 --> 01:31:17,862
Very strange,
and difficult to explain, really.

1131
01:31:17,863 --> 01:31:20,062
Is it, George?

1132
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:22,782
Stan Goodfellow
encounters him in the woods,

1133
01:31:22,783 --> 01:31:25,862
thinks he might raise the alarm
and kills him to keep him quiet.

1134
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:28,502
No, Tom. This man died recently.

1135
01:31:28,503 --> 01:31:30,702
This morning, in fact.

1136
01:31:30,703 --> 01:31:33,782
Long after Stanley Goodfellow
was arrested. No.

1137
01:31:33,783 --> 01:31:35,822
It's the manner of his death.

1138
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,063
I've heard of it and never seen it.

1139
01:31:40,063 --> 01:31:42,023
Parasympathetic rebound.

1140
01:31:43,183 --> 01:31:45,582
It happens when
someone is so terrified

1141
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:49,502
that the whole
metabolic system reacts
and tries to calm itself down.

1142
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:53,303
The problem is,
it can make too good a job of it,
and the heart simply stops beating.

1143
01:31:55,423 --> 01:31:58,423
I don't know what it was he
encountered in Monksbarton Woods.

1144
01:31:59,543 --> 01:32:01,623
Frankly, I hope I never find out.

1145
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:07,463
Aargh!

1146
01:32:16,143 --> 01:32:18,063
Parasympathetic rebound.

1147
01:32:19,903 --> 01:32:22,022
You're telling me
that Cyrus LeVanu...

1148
01:32:22,023 --> 01:32:23,983
died of fright.
