2
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:17,776
I'll just go get one more.

3
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,336
Same again?

4
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:28,112
Actually, I could um...
I could do with a change.

5
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,792
I got a slot free after the shift,
babe.

6
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:37,432
Know what, Jamie?
I'd rather kill myself!

7
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,672
Yep?

8
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,792
I think you'd better step outside.

9
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,752
What? Hang on.

10
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:58,112
Over here.

11
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:15,672
Come with me.

12
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,752
You're going to pay up.

13
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:22,112
What are you laughing at? Eh?

14
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:25,232
Oh, no, you don't.
I've got it in the car.

15
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:31,392
This'll make you laugh.

16
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:36,111
You ain't laughing now, are ya?

17
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:39,232
Ten thousand. Ten thou, or else.

18
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,911
OK, can you gather round, please?

19
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:15,911
Just want to say a few words about
what we have to get out of today.

20
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:19,951
Remember, if we get broken up into
groups it's key that we're diverse.

21
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,871
- So, are we feeling motivated?
- Yes, sir!

22
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:25,472
No "sirs" today,
but more on that later.

23
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:28,551
Now, I want you to wear these badges

24
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:31,031
as firmly and prominently as
possible all day long.

25
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,872
It's absolutely key to the exercise.
Understood? Yes.

26
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,512
My tendonitis is back.

27
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,192
It was your other elbow before.

28
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:49,831
Well, it'll make a change from
hanging about at home all weekend.

29
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:51,792
I do not "hang about at home".

30
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:59,071
Is that him?

31
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,391
Acting Chief Superintendent Cotton,
for it is he.

32
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:07,392
He's terribly young. Looks rather
cute to be a pain in the backside.

33
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:12,111
Looks can be
deceptive. Bye, love. Bye.

34
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,071
- Everybody happy?
- Yes.

35
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:18,191
Now, the Chief Constable
sees teamwork as the hard-wiring
for his new programme,

36
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,551
and this workshop's
all about team building.

37
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,191
We're very lucky to have some ex-TA
instructors with us for the day,

38
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,431
so I'm sure you'll find it anything
but boring.

39
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,591
Once we leave here, we forget who's
boss and who's not.

40
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,552
It's strictly first names only.

41
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:35,591
I want everyone to contribute
and to criticise,

42
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:38,072
without regard to rank or
experience.

43
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:40,592
OK? Into the van!

44
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:13,072
Thanks, Caro.
Come to carol practice later.

45
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:17,752
It'll do you good.
Therapy? You sound like Tim.

46
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,072
No decorations again this year?

47
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,592
What's the point?

48
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,712
I can't do Christmas, Caro.

49
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:32,032
Come and sing. Promise?

50
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,672
All OK?
Sweet as, boss.

51
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:07,432
Good Friday night?
Eh? Oh, yeah. Well, I've had better.

52
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:12,111
They closed the road up near Delham.
We'll unload at the yard.
What about -

53
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:15,832
Don't panic, Dale, I've got it
sorted. Go and have your breakfast,
wait for my call.

54
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:40,751
Off to win the war single-handed
again, Colonel?

55
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:43,232
Oh, I wish I was, Don.

56
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,072

57
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,512
Hold on, darling.

58
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,512
I'm expected at Caro's.
Penny, I hardly see you.

59
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,272
It helps being with Caro.

60
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,952
She helps.
Gilly was my daughter too, you know.

61
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,872
Morning, Sergeant.
Hard night?

62
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:39,592
Worked till two, sir, but there's
still a rattle in the cam case.
I need to strip it down again.

63
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:43,791
We're due to deliver tomorrow
and we've got this police thing at
the centre.

64
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:46,351
Jamie'll be on my back.
Don't worry about Jamie, sir.

65
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:49,151
I'll start as soon as we get back.
It'll be sorted tonight.

66
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:52,072
I appreciate it, Ed. I don't know
where I'd be without you.

67
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,792
You look exhausted, love.
Huh!

68
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:15,672
Love?

69
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,432
That's the driver's log books
checked.

70
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:25,031
You off? Recce-ing the war game
with the Colonel.

71
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:28,072
I'll be a couple of hours. Layla
didn't come home till morning again.

72
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,632
I'll try and talk to her later.

75

We don't want to let the side down

Never readier, sir.
It's "John", remember?

83
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,992
We're dispensing with hierarchies,
today, Tom. And why?

84
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:35,671
Because in order to fight crime
today, we need to reboot our
relationships

85
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:38,992
as well as our systems.
Rebooting? I say, sir!

Yes! Good to see you again.

This is Detective Sergeant Jones.
Detective Sergeant.

93
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,871
I...I didn't know the TA provided
this kind of stuff.

94
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:11,352
Well, our Colonel had his arm
twisted by your Chief Super.

Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby
and Detective Sergeant Jones,
Causton CID.

96
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:21,151
This is our CO, Colonel Matt Parkes.
I've heard a lot about you, Chief
Inspector - all good.

97
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,831
So you, er, train potential recruits
here, do you?

to keep wearing the uniform.
Eh, Captain?

100
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:33,991
You hardly need that, sir. I served
under the Colonel for 12 years.

101
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:37,392
Saw some hard soldiering together,
eh, Tim? Certainly did, sir.

102
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:41,991
So are you er... just observing
today, or making the jumps yourself?

103
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:44,752
Oh, I hope there's no jumps involved.

104

00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,792
Come round to the right.
ROUND TO THE RIGHT! Oh!

154
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,872
God!
Having fun, Tom?

155
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:58,631
Are we having fun, Tom?
Well, you may be, Ben,

156
00:13:58,632 --> 00:14:02,871
but I'm busy marvelling at the
contribution egg-and-spoon racing
makes to police work

157
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:05,072
- Come on, up you get.
- Need another egg?

158
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,952
Beats slashing after-eight charges
in the office, sir. Yeah.

159
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,512
Afternoon, Penny.

160
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,712
Very sorry to have disturbed.

161
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,952
Stabs you through the heart,
that look. Poor woman!

162
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:57,352
Time she accepted you've nothing to
answer for, sir. Would you, George?

163
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:00,032
In her position?

164
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,847
OK, team, let's hear
from Captain Galsworthy.

165
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:29,407
We'll be going inside for some
role-play work shortly,

166
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,327
but before we do that,
Sergeant Lovell?

167
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,527
Right, teams of three this time.

168
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:36,008
Two pairs of handcuffs for each.

169
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,767
Don!
Oh! Afternoon, Mr James.

170
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:56,127
Thought I'd make your day.
Bacchanalia, 4:30 at Coombe.

171
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:58,967
Great odds. Stable boy at Ringlands
says he can't lose.

172
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,288
If you're quick,
you can still go and put one on.

173
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:04,087
Oh, the Colonel wouldn't like it.

174
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,647
He's dug in at the woods,
playing soldiers with George.

175
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:08,528
Yeah, well, Dale's due back.

176
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,528
Is he? Well, I can check him in.

177
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:15,368
Go on.

178
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:37,808
Go on, go for it.

179
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:42,128
Well done, team.
Handcuffs back to me, please.

180
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:47,367
OK, team, we're stranded.
We'll come back to your log.

181
00:16:47,368 --> 00:16:49,087
That won't work.
Positive thinking!

182
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,047
We won't all fit on, John.
Think teamwork, Tom. We can do it.

183
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,727
Trust, trust, trust. Ready, Ben?

184
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:57,367
Ah, well... I er...
You first. I wouldn't do it, Jones.

185
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,248
Ignore him, Ben.

186
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,848
Jones, you are a...

187
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,968
Sorry, sir.
Aargh!

188
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,448
Nina keeping her spirits up?

189
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:37,487
She's doing fine, thank you, sir.
Good. Give her my best, will you?

190
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,208
Sir.
Bye now, George.

191
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:47,847
Why don't you stop saluting and tell
him exactly where to shove his job?

192
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:50,927
In fact, his whole haulage business?
Don't start, love.

193
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:53,328
Mum tells me that you weren't home
till dawn.

194
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:56,368
So?

195
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,527
Where do you go all night, love?

196
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:02,967
What's it got to do with you?
We worry, Layla.

197
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:05,687
Dad, if you'd once stood up
for yourself with the Parkeses,

198
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:07,207
I wouldn't be stuck here,

199
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,008
cleaning toilets and wiping up stale
beer for a living!

200
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:12,807
♪ Forth they went together

201
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:15,328

wild lament

00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:20,368

00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:24,927
♪ Sire, the night is darker now

204
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:27,128
♪ And the wind blows stronger

00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:28,847
♪ Fails my heart...

206
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:31,208
That looks nice.
Especially for you, Soldier.

207
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,768
Can you see the hook, just there?
Yes.

208
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,247
Oh, perfect!
And can you put that up?

209
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:42,367
♪ Thou shalt find the winter's rage

210

00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,408
Oh, that looks lovely.
What about um... this here?

212
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,488
Are you going out again?

213
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,848
I forgot to check
the gates at the centre were locked.

214
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:04,367
"Coming up in half an hour,
Ant And Dec's Christmas Special.

215
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,007
Before that, though,
a chance to wallow in nostalgia

216
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,928
as we explore Christmas
past and Christmas presents!"

217
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:23,088
Is that your father?
Yes. The Halseys have been soldiers
for generations.

218
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:27,248
You were never tempted
by a military career, then?

219
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:30,608
Youthful rebellion, and all that!

220
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:35,008
It's comforting to think that
his values and mine are united.

221
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:38,727
Well, in a way,

222
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:41,608
turning this house over to soldiers
less lucky than he was.

223
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:47,848
What does your family think
of you living in the servants'
quarters of your own home?

224
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:50,967
My only daughter died in childbirth.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

225
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,168
Oh, a long time ago now.

226
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:58,448
I'm sure she would have approved,
though. Like me, she married
a military man.

227
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:20,288
Wow! Isn't it lovely!
Daisy! Daisy.

228
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:23,568
I thought we'd go
to my private penthouse.

229
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:26,248
Don't want to disturb the old man,
do we?

230
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:33,048
"My dreams were disturbed
by visions of what is going on."

231
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:38,607
"And then the great day arrived."

232
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,488
"Daddy! Daddy!"

233
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,047
"Like all other children, they don't
know what to do first,

234
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:50,528
with so many presents all around
them, so many things to play with."

235
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,728
All right, all right!

236
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:34,767
I'm coming! I'm coming.

237
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:37,288
"Oh, how beautiful!"
Hello? Parkes Freight.

238
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:41,688
Hello?

239
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:45,247
"But Santa made a grave mistake.

240
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,568
He left a railroad train for Jackie.

241
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:50,647
He should have left it for Daddy,

242
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:53,568
because fathers and mothers
never grow up - not on Christmas!

243
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:57,408
Merry Christmas, everybody."

244
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:00,688
"Merry Christmas to all!"

245
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,767
Great session, well done.

246
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:28,648
A hand for Captain Galsworthy!

247
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:34,927
Many thanks. I hope you've all
managed to get something out of it.

248
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:36,808
You all have
a very good journey home.

249
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:43,728
It's going to hurt in the morning.
Interesting day, Ben, yes?

250
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:48,008
Thought provoking, sir.
"John". Good.

251
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:50,928
What about some spontaneous
peer evaluation?

252
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:57,728
Sir? "John". How do you rate Tom's
teamwork, on a scale of 1 to 10?

253
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:03,208
Is, er, 1 top or bottom, sir?
Bottom.

254
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:07,208
We talked about honesty, Ben. We're
all on the same side, remember?

255
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,488
10.

256
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:12,688
Now, come on. No-one's perfect.

257
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:15,768
Yeah, OK. 9, then. Really?
Well, 8 is as low as I'll go.

258
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:20,207
In my view,
Tom has shown some reluctance

259
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,127
to buy into our team scenario.

260
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,088
Yes.

261
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:28,208
That's because...

262
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,208
Because...?

263
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:38,528
Carry on, Ben. This is good.
Open up. Have your say.

264
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:46,208
Excuse me.

265
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:52,008
Because he thinks it's rubbish, sir.
John.

266
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,968
Jones. Sorry. What's up?

267
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:04,367
Are you sure you're OK, love?
Yes, I'm fine, honestly.

268
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:07,888
Now, come on.
I want the medics to check you out.
OK, but I'm really just cold.

269
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:16,247
Right, golden hour actions:
elimination of known offenders.

270
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,047
You've had a similar incident
of arson recently.

271
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:22,288
Yeah, Poulter the pyromaniac, but
I'm fairly sure it wasn't him.

272
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:27,928
Fuzzy logic, Tom. Gut instinct
can let you down. Systems won't.

273
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:31,167
We banged Poulter up last Wednesday,
sir.

274
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:36,248
Ah, right. Well, this is a great
moment to do live process checks.

275
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:40,048
What I'll do is,
I'll... I'll see you guys later.

276
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:44,367
Chief Inspector, this is my son
and business partner, James.

277
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:45,807
Colonel. Mr Parkes.
All right?

278
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:48,567
Shall I get a sit rep
from the Senior Fire Officer, sir?

279
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:51,808
Yeah, you do that.
Were you here when the fire started?

280
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:56,807
I was in the house. Jamie was in the
grain store with... with a friend.

281
00:25:56,808 --> 00:26:01,047
We could've bloody fried in there!
It's a flat the drivers used to use.

282
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:03,487
James has been staying there
since he came home.

283
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:06,448
Home from where? France. Starting
to wonder why I didn't stay.

284
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,607
How's the watchman?
Oh, he's not seriously hurt.

285
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:13,567
The hospital are keeping him
overnight, running a full service.

286
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:15,448
Shame he wasn't giving us one!

287
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:19,808
James, have you any reason to believe
that you were the target?

288
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:22,728
No.
I just noticed your eye.

289
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:26,168
I got drunk last night.
Walked into a door.

290
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,488
SFO says it's OK to go in, sir.

291
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,808
Excuse me.

292
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:38,127
He doesn't remember me.
Leave it, Dad. I'll look after her.

293
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:41,048
I went to school with James Parkes.
Right little prat he was, too!

294
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:43,728
Hey! Hey, who's that?

295
00:26:57,568 --> 00:27:02,048
Structure looks sound.
No sign of a white transit.

296
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:10,807
Oh, erm, George Barkham,
my yard manager. DCI Barnaby.

297
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:12,968
You ex-TA too, eh?
Sir.

298
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:17,848
Terrible mess!
Well, no-one was hurt, anyway.

299
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:23,208
Any idea how it happened, sir?
SFO thinks arson, sir.

300
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:27,607
No! They've already found
traces of chlorate and sugar

301
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:29,568
and wiring fused
to the axle of the truck.

302
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:35,407
Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got
jobs to lay off or cancel before
the morning. Yes.

303
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:37,168
Come on.
Sir.

304
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,887
We'll need someone here overnight.
Sorted, sir.

305
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:47,327
And we need interviews with the
watchman and the driver of the truck.

306
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:52,647
They're father and son. I've
arranged a visit for the morning.
Very thorough. Just doing my job.

307
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:54,687
Jones...
Yes, sir?

308
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:58,647
I'm not going to get you tarred and
feathered and sent to Traffic, all
right? You're not?

309
00:27:58,648 --> 00:28:01,527
No. I thought I'd dropped you in it
with the Boy Wonder, sir.

310
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:05,928
Well, yes, you did. But your candour
merely hastens the inevitable.

311
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:09,008
♪ See an open door

312
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:12,408
♪ Find a way into your heart...

313
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:16,368
I'll give you my own personal
medical examination later.

314
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:19,368
This is no time for champagne, son.

315
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:23,607
And... the young lady should be
getting home.

316
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:25,488
Daisy's staying over, actually.

317
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:29,048
You and I have work to do.
Ah, give it a rest, will you, Dad?

318
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:35,447
There's a taxi waiting outside.
I said I want her to stay!

319
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:40,328
I'm sure you understand. I'll go.
I'm sorry about what's happened.

320
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,128
I'm sorry, Mr Parkes.

321
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:03,567
If you know anything
about all this...

322
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:06,968
Me? I'm a victim here! Nothing to do
with your... girlfriend problems?

323
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:10,168
I'm not the one with the problems,
Dad, remember?

324
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,808
I'm not used to being under attack
on my own premises, Jamie!

325
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,767
I'd at least like to know what kind
of threat we're facing.

326
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:21,448
Fine! You can tell me
as soon as you've worked it out!

327
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,727
I just heard about your fire
on the news, Tom.

328
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,328
Oh, yeah? I must've driven past there
minutes before it went up!

329
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:41,328
Oi! Get off.
Oh, it's good. Good, that.

330
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:45,847
Do you know what happened yet?
Well, it wasn't an accident.

331
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:47,728
We know that much.

332
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:50,328
How was your carol singing?
Tiring!

333
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,047
Caroline says that the concert is
nearly a sell-out already. Ooh!

334
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:58,247
All we need now
is someone of local stature

335
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,168
to present the cheque on the night.

336
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,688
Oh, all right!
Flattery will get you everywhere.

337
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:09,008
Actually, I've asked
Superintendent Cotton.

338
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:14,968
He was charming!
Just waiting for confirmation.

339
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,048
Here.

340
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:29,608
It was fantastic, you know, Caro.

341
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,608
The roar of the flames, the heat...

342
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:36,168
Like Hell's fire!

343
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,288
Penny, this has to stop!

344
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:44,688
It'll never stop.

345
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:47,928
Not till I'm dead.

346
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,968
Or he is.

347
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:03,241
Yeah. Right, OK. Yeah. Thanks.

348
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:08,095
Don't look now, sir,
but we're being watched. Where?

349
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:10,496
One o'clock. Big man in red.

350
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:15,896
Oh, you're full of fun today,
Jones I like Christmas, sir.

351
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:22,055
That was Forensics. They've found
pieces of the detonator for the
bomb: a 24-hour clock.

352
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:24,935
So it could have been planted any
time up to a day previously.

353
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:29,655
Yeah. Won't make our job any easier.
Positive thinking, Jones. Positive
thinking!

354
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:31,735
See you later.

355
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:34,576
Mr Parkes! I just wanted to see
how Don was getting on.

356
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:37,856
Problem with that?

357
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:41,176
Thank you.

358
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,336
Police, Dad.

359
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,975
How are you feeling, Mr Mitchinson?

360
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:55,496
Not bad. Could be worse.
Mr Parkes was just telling us there
was a bomb under my truck.

361
00:31:56,336 --> 00:32:01,735
Yes, that is correct. Dale, your last
run was to Marseilles, yes?

362
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:03,935
Yeah, we go regular
for a feed company.

363
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:08,295
Can you tell us, please, what
happened during the 24 hours
before you arrived back?

364
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:10,336
It's all in the log.
No - you tell me.

365
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:15,095
Well, I left Marseilles about six,

366
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:17,655
drove up far as Paris,
stayed in the cab overnight

367
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:20,576
and did the crossing um...
about ten-ish the next day.

368
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:23,895
Did you leave the truck while it was
being loaded?

369
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:25,776
No way! Too many foreigners about.

370
00:32:26,536 --> 00:32:29,295
Was the truck checked by customs
at Dover?

371
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:32,536
Yeah, Dover and Calais. Load check,
mirrors, sniffers - the works.

372
00:32:34,056 --> 00:32:36,816
And you checked Dale
back into the yard at what time?

373
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:40,015
Just after three - about ten past.
Wasn't it, Dad?

374
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,455
Yeah, that's right.

375
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:46,135
And there were no strangers in the
yard during the afternoon or evening?

376
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,296
No unexpected occurrences?

377
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:51,536
No. Well, only the phone call.

378
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:54,735
"Divine intervention", the Colonel
said.

379
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:58,096
If it wasn't for that call, I
could've gone up with that garage.

380
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:03,896
Who was the call from?
Don't know. Well, they rang off when
I picked up.

381
00:33:05,296 --> 00:33:08,615
The bomb must've been planted
this side of the Channel.

382
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:12,376
Dale didn't make any stops or leave
the truck after he'd made that
crossing.

383
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:16,855
It's hard to see anyone had the
opportunity to plant a bomb at
all, isn't it?

384
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:19,735
He was nervous.
And his father was even more so.

385
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,975
Lucky break for him, anyway.

386
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:25,696
Fate, Jones -
or the arsonist.

387
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:33,216
Maybe... maybe the bomber wanted to
make sure Mitchinson wasn't harmed.

388
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:50,135
How was Don?
Fine, yeah. Nothing wrong with him
that a bet or two wouldn't cure

389
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:52,175
Erm, by the way, I've been meaning
to ask...

390
00:33:52,176 --> 00:33:55,616
Erm, did you see a van in the
garage yesterday afternoon?

391
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:59,815
Long-wheel-base Transit. It was gone
when I got back from the woods,

392
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:02,215
before the explosion.
No, I didn't see it.

393
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:04,735
Oh, well, I'll ask Don.
It's just a van, Dad!

394
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:07,695
It's probably one of the drivers'.
What's the problem?

395
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,295
A bomb went off in the garage,
Jamie, a matter of hours later -

396
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:12,216
Fine, fine, fine. I'll check it out.

397
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:22,936
OK, yes. Thank you.

398
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:29,015
They're pretty sure the tread's
from a standard-issue army boot.

399
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,936
Not your little blonde, then?
Also...

400
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,735
..particles of ash mixed with earth
in the tread pattern.

401
00:34:34,736 --> 00:34:37,415
Proving the
wearer was here after the explosion.

402
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,256
Got to be the firestarter,
hasn't it?

403
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:43,935
Why use a timer when you're planning
to attend the event, then?

404
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:46,415
Some of them like to watch, don't
they?

405
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,335
And if he is army, he might know
something about bomb making.

406
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:53,135
We need the boots
from the Centre - all of them.
The instructors' and the recruits'.

407
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:56,736
Meanwhile, the question is not just
the how, but also the why.

408
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:02,535
He's no soldier, but I wouldn't put
it past James Parkes, sir -
for the insurance, maybe.

409
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:05,016
Our finance
checks say the business is sound.

410
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,816
Nothing sound about sonny Jim, sir.
I'd put money on it.

411
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:14,815
Police have some questions, Dad.
I've gotta be somewhere.

412
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:19,136
Er, no, Mr Parkes. I'd appreciate
your input too, if you'd be so kind.

413
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:24,416
Do you know of anyone
who might have had a reason
to harm you or your business?

414
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,895
A rival company, perhaps?

415
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:29,776
Or a disgruntled employee?

416
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,816
I cut out some dead wood
when I first got back.

417
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,655
Did you? Can you give us some names?

418
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:41,455
With respect, sir - the "dead wood"
was all loyal employees.

419
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:44,736
None of them would think of harming
the Colonel or his business.

420
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:48,816
I see. No family feud?

421
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:51,936
Neighbourhood dispute?

422
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,136
Abandoned lovers?

423
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:57,856
Caroline Halsey's hardly a friend.
What, her at the Manor?

424
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,655
She's not an enemy either, Jamie.

425
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:02,736
Well, that's me out of ideas
Can I go?

426
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:05,856
Don't go far, Mr Parkes.
We'll need to talk to you again.

427
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:09,896
Why would he suspect Ms Halsey?

428
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,856
She's my late wife's mother,
Jamie's grandmother.

429
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:18,256
There's no love lost between them.

430
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:23,416
Jamie's here, Tim.

431
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:31,455
You shouldn't have come.
I wanted to check the merchandise.

432
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:34,215
We're meeting the buyer for
that one at five, usual place.

433
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:36,975
I'll be delivering the Bugatti
around midnight. Tonight?

434
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:41,095
What about the police? You're stupid
to even think about it! Ed's right.

435
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:45,136
Can't keep the customers waiting,
people. And there's plenty of them!

436
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:48,016
You'd better go.

437
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,056
- Jamie! You're unscathed.
- You sound surprised

438
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:56,416
More... disappointed.

439
00:36:57,056 --> 00:37:00,175
I've given your name to the police,
you know. Oh, come on!

440
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:04,095
You can't think I'm the only soul
round here that wishes you
a terrifying comeuppance.

441
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,976
Screw you, Grandma.

442
00:37:08,016 --> 00:37:09,856
Caroline?

443
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:22,136
What was he doing here?
Yes, Tim - what WAS he doing here?

444
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:24,376
Problem with his car.

445
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,656
That's the girl we saw last night
at the yard.

446
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:52,696
Hello. I'm DS Jones and this is
DCI Barnaby.

447
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:57,016
What's your name?
Layla... Barkham.

448
00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:01,136
Any relation to...
George? Yep - my father.

449
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:04,975
So, what were you doing at the
haulage yard last night?

450
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:07,176
Looking. Is that a crime

451
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:18,816
Layla, we'd like a word about James
Parkes. One word? "Devious".

452
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:20,416
More would be better.

453
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,979
Jamie uses people.

454
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,899
Since he got back from France,
he's ripped off, hurt or upset
half the village.

455
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,500
Who specifically has he hurt?
Try the Galsworthys.

456
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,099
Their daughter Gilly
was a friend of mine.

457
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,339
He started on her
as soon as he came home

458
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,660
and she fell for it all the way.

459
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,700
They'd only been going out a couple
of weeks. She got pregnant.

460
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,900
That's when she found out who James
really cares about.

461
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,220
What, he dropped her?
Huh! And the rest.

462
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,420
Denied it was his. Made out Gilly
was a slut.

463
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,700
She went to pieces.

464
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,459
Hanged herself in Calham Woods,

465
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,380
almost exactly two years ago.

466
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,100
That figures.
She was such a cool person!

467
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,220
We were good friends.

468
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,180
What about Caroline Halsey?

469
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,380
James seems to regard her as some
kind of enemy.

470
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,380
She was Gilly's godmother.

471
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,900
And what about you, Layla? What did
James Parkes do to you?

472
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,820
He screwed us,
like he does everyone else.

473
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,419
"Us"?

474
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,659
Just before Jamie came home,

475
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,060
my dad was going to be
made a partner in the firm.

476
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,219
Then Jamie pitches up,

477
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,939
sweet-talks his dad...

478
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,139
Partnership goes to him, instead!

479
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,500
Is that why you firebombed his yard
to get even?

480
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,900
If I wanted to hurt Jamie, I'd hurt
HIM, not his truck.

481
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,660
If what you say is true, I'm
surprised Colonel Parkes wants his
son around at all.

482
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,140
Colonel's just like my dad -
too forgiving.

483
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,660
Now, that's what I call
genuine teamwork!

484
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,299
We had the feeling that you weren't
convinced by our programme.

485
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,100
It wasn't your programme that failed
to convince me, Captain. Sergeant.

486
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,979
I was hoping to talk to
your wife, sir.

487
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,100
She's over at the Manor
with Caroline Halsey.

488
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,340
Can I help?
Shall I go, Tim?

489
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,860
I've no secrets from Ed, Mr Barnaby.

490
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,699
I understand that both you and Mrs
Galsworthy

491
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,620
have very good reason to feel
bitterly towards the Parkes family.

492
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,459
I don't hold James Parkes
responsible for my daughter's death,

493
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,379
let alone the Colonel.

494
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,780
Blame, in my experience,
can be an emotional,
rather than a rational reaction.

495
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,859
I...
I admit that Penny persists

496
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,780
in the belief that James...

497
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,819
..that it was
his fault that Gilly died.

498
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,740
But a bomb?

499
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,380
She wouldn't know where to begin.

500
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,100
But you would.

501
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:22,460
Look, the terrible fact is that
Gilly was no longer a child.

502
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,900
Penny and I had to let her go, had
to let her make her own choices...

503
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
..however much we might regret them.

504
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,780
I'd known Gilly
since she was a little girl.

505
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,140
Of course, I cared about her, but -
Revenge is a very poor remedy for
loss.

506
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,700
I think I can speak for both of
us on that.

507
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,300
Why aren't you on boot duty?

508
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,219
I've got a load more at the station,
too. This is my last stop.

509
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,540
Oh, and you asked for the list of
locals with relevant previous, sir.

510
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,740
Apart from Mr Poulter, there's just
the one.

511
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Ooh!

512
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,620
Ms Halsey? I'm Detective Chief
Inspector Barnaby from Causton CID.

513
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,820
Joyce's husband. Yes.
How can I help?

514
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,699
You can help by telling me if you
made or planted the bomb

515
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,259
that exploded at Parkes' haulage yard
last night.

516
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:39,340
No! I didn't.

517
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,019
But you were arrested once for
detonating an explosive device on
Ministry of Defence property.

518
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,220
That wasn't a bomb!
It was a mega firework!

519
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,219
All right. It's generally known

520
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,619
that I condemn war
as a means to resolve conflict,

521
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,380
but I have absolutely no desire
to cause anyone personal injury.

522
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,140
We believe that the bomber, the
arsonist, could have been a soldier,

523
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,100
or someone dressed as a soldier.

524
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,660
I'd heard.

525
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,300
Your fire seems to need attention.

526
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,740
Would you mind?

527
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,820
Erm...?
They belonged to Gilly.

528
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,979
I've tried to stop Penny,

529
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,540
but she's taken to dressing up
in them in the evenings.

530
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,619
For what purpose? She's convinced
herself Jamie is a sexual predator,

531
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,420
that he forces himself
on vulnerable young women,

532
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,940
so she's started keeping watch.

533
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,460
Her "midnight manoeuvres",
she calls them.

534
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,980
She intends to catch him red-handed.

535
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,940
And you don't disagree with her view
of your grandson James?

536
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,059
My daughter lost her life giving
birth to Jamie, Chief Inspector,

537
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,499
and almost from the first day,

538
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:16,180
he proved himself
to be a self-serving,
despicable human being.

539
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,980
But I really don't believe he ever
forced himself on Gilly.

540
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,140
She loved him.

541
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,220
Is he even old enough to drive?
Old enough to have made his third
million already this year.

542
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,940
Yeah, man. She's hot.
Everything you've ever wanted, mate.

543
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,180
Now all I want is my fifty grand.

544
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,580
The Chief Inspector
needs to talk to you, darling.

545
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,860
He wants to know
if I blew up Parkes's yard

546
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,820
Indeed I do, Mrs Galsworthy.

547
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,260
James Parkes violated my daughter.
He stole her life.

548
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,260
I wish I HAD started the fire.

549
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,660
I wish James had been consumed
alive.

550
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,740
Ms Halsey here tells me that you have
been following him.

551
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,300
Someone's got to.
And that you were in the Yard
last night when the fire started.

552
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,819
Daisy Fisher, the girl with Jamie.

553
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,700
17. Still at school.

554
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,900
Right. Tell me what happened.

555
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,060
Jamie was in the grain store with
Daisy. I heard a phone ring.

556
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,540
Don went to answer it, then he came
back out again and - bang!

557
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,939
Mrs Galsworthy,

558
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,219
I need your firmest assurance

559
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,820
that you
will stay away from James Parkes...

560
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,140
and refrain
from any further "manoeuvres".

561
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,499
All right. I promise.

562
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,580
O Come All Ye Faithful

563
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,859
♪ Come and behold him

564
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,019
♪ Born the king of angels

565
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,419
Ooh, the Mitchinsons strike it lucky!

566
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,340
♪ O come let us adore him

567
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:42,580
♪ O come let us adore him

568
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,260
Only two more.

569
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,579
What are you two doing?

570
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,859
We're trying to match all these with
the prints found at the scene, sir.

571
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,859
I can see that, Ben. My point is,
it's Tech Support's job,

572
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,940
so why are YOU doing it?
Vomiting and diarrhoea, sir.

573
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,100
They think it was the pork pies
at the Christmas do.

574
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,780
It's laid low the entire Tech
department.

575
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,620
Fine. OK, I'll leave you to it.

576
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,860
I didn't know anyone was sick, sir.

577
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,260
All done. No matches.

578
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,780
I think you'll have
more success with these.

579
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,219
Unfortunately,
I'm inclined to doubt that the owner
is, indeed, our arsonist,

580
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,100
but check 'em, anyway.

581
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,060
Did you um... find out about the van?

582
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,899
What?

583
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,019
Yeah, yeah. Turns out it's Dale's.
Bought it a couple of weeks ago.

584
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,659
Needed some work, so he got a mate
to drive it over

585
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,980
so Bill could have a look at it
Saturday morning.

586
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,020
You drank the last of the Scotch?

587
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:07,179
No-one we've spoken to has a bad word
to say for Colonel Parkes

588
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,500
and the opposite seems to be true
for his son!

589
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,099
Here, William. Happy Christmas.
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

590
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,140
But if James was indeed the target
in the attack,

591
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,219
and if the murder was personal,

592
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,940
why explode a bomb in an empty lorry
in the garage, eh?

593
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,980
I'm out of ideas, sir.

594
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,460
Positive thinking, Jones.
Something'll turn up.

595
00:49:15,796 --> 00:49:18,475
Get in the car.
No. I've got to go to work.

596
00:49:18,476 --> 00:49:22,996
Get in the car, or I start talking
about what you really get up to in
Causton every night.

597
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:30,516
Body in a tool box, sir.

598
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,116
Some kids called it in first thing
this morning.

599
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:39,916
They found it caught in the tree
roots at the edge of the lake.

600
00:49:43,716 --> 00:49:45,395
Morning, George. What you got?

601
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:47,516
Morning, Tom. Male in his forties.

602
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:50,035
Various bumps and
bruises on the body

603
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:52,195
possibly consistent with a fight

604
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:54,916
and some lethal blunt-force trauma
to the head.

605
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,595
So he was killed and...
stuffed in the box!

606
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:01,235
Yeah. Best guess for now -
two or three days ago.

607
00:50:01,236 --> 00:50:04,635
He's been floating out in the lake
all this while?
Not floating initially,

608
00:50:04,636 --> 00:50:07,275
but water encourages decomposition
and putrefaction.

609
00:50:07,276 --> 00:50:09,555
There's a lot of gas arises from
that process,

610
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:12,636
which I suspect, in this case,
got trapped, built up and he
floated.

611
00:50:13,196 --> 00:50:17,316
Nothing in the box on ID? No, sir.
How did he get here?

612
00:50:17,636 --> 00:50:20,555
We don't know.
Discolouration on the upper body

613
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:24,396
suggests he spent time
in foreign climes. Bag up!

614
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,876
James Parkes lived in France, sir.

615
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,435
What are you saying?
That James knew him?

616
00:50:30,436 --> 00:50:32,835
He was sporting a black eye the
night we met him.

617
00:50:32,836 --> 00:50:36,076
This guy's been in a fight. It could
be thieves falling out, sir.

618
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,196
Did you see it?
The body? No. Why?

619
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:49,276
I saw James again last night.
Oh, Penny! You promised.

620
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:52,156
I was at home! Sleepless.

621
00:50:54,276 --> 00:50:58,116
He was coming out of the workshop
with Tim at three o'clock in the
morning,

622
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:03,156
and there was someone else with him,
in a van. Doing what?

623
00:51:03,996 --> 00:51:07,876
He and Tim were arguing. Then he got
in the van and drove off.

624
00:51:13,116 --> 00:51:16,115
Perhaps it's got something to do
with that man in the lake.

625
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:18,516
You can't think Tim's
mixed up in anything?!

626
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,636
I've no idea
what he's mixed up with.

627
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:34,075
What's this?
Tim's army knife. I borrowed it.

628
00:51:34,076 --> 00:51:36,195
For...?

629
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:41,316
Self-defence... or the defence of
others. Emergencies do arise.

630
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:48,996
Thanks very much, madam.
If the dead man's not local and
we've got no ID, where do we start?

631
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:54,395
Get a photograph organised and pass
it round the village. Sir!
See if anyone recognises him.

632
00:51:54,396 --> 00:51:58,956
Thank you. Let's concentrate on who
he was and what he was here for.

633
00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:02,396
Ooh! Boy Wonder at 12 o'clock -
minus the silly grin.

634
00:52:03,116 --> 00:52:04,996
Mayday, Mayday

635
00:52:09,396 --> 00:52:11,316
Give us a moment, Sergeant.

636
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,556
There was no tummy bug
in Tech Support.

637
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:26,755
No, sir. I can take a joke, Tom,
but the more serious point

638
00:52:26,756 --> 00:52:29,435
is about tasking
and man-hour allocation.

639
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:33,795
Yeah, but Tech Support, they're
usually - It's clear I've failed
to take you with me so far,

640
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:37,396
but I'm not giving up.
We're going to do a real-time review
of the inquiry.

641
00:52:38,476 --> 00:52:41,315
All you and your team have to do is
minute your activities

642
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:43,555
in quarter-hour segments
for the next 48 hours.

643
00:52:43,556 --> 00:52:45,356
Then I'll run up a CPA
from the data.

644
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:50,356
Thank you, sir. You'll see. I'll make
a believer of you yet!

645
00:52:51,716 --> 00:52:53,636
Yes, sir.

646
00:52:55,836 --> 00:52:57,756
Ben.

647
00:52:58,796 --> 00:53:01,476
Are we busted, sir?
I don't know, really.

648
00:53:01,996 --> 00:53:03,916
What's that?

649
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:06,396
I'm not sure.

650
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:10,596
Nothing important.

651
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,316
Layla? What's wrong?

652
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:34,796
What happened?

653
00:53:41,596 --> 00:53:43,516
Colonel...

654
00:53:44,276 --> 00:53:48,396
Chief Inspector! I was going to call
about our war game
in the woods tonight.

655
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:54,156
I'm afraid the... the woods are off
limits until forensics are complete.

656
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:57,476
I'm sorry.
But while I have you all here,

657
00:53:58,356 --> 00:54:00,636
including you, Mr Parkes, please.

658
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:04,436
Thank you.

659
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,835
I'd like you to take a look at this.
That's the man we found in the lake

660
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:11,916
and we think that he was killed the
night before the explosion, the fire.

661
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,236
No-one I know. George?

662
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:20,276
No.

663
00:54:20,596 --> 00:54:22,556
Sorry. Erm... can't help.

664
00:54:23,076 --> 00:54:28,195
I hope you can, sir. We need to set
up an incident room locally

665
00:54:28,196 --> 00:54:31,875
and a room
at your Centre would suit us nicely.

666
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:34,555
Jones. Oh, one good turn,
Chief Inspector...

667
00:54:34,556 --> 00:54:37,955
Permission to do battle in the woods
tonight? Highlight for the recruits.

668
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:40,635
Terrible shame to disappoint.
I see. Yeah, all right.

669
00:54:40,636 --> 00:54:43,555
I'll see if I can get an area
cordoned off. I'll look into that.

670
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:46,836
Hang on. Sounds like a break, sir.
Excuse me.

671
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:51,715
Oh, Jamie, erm... Wait a minute!

672
00:54:51,716 --> 00:54:53,636
The dead man's car, sir.

673
00:54:56,156 --> 00:54:59,556
George tells me Bill was at a family
wedding all day Saturday.

674
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:03,715
What was Dale's van really doing
in the garage the day of the fire?

675
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:05,956
Give me a break, Dad.
I want to know, Jamie!

676
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:09,596
Now!
OK, look.

677
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:12,795
Dale got talked into a dodgy loan,
to pay for the van.

678
00:55:12,796 --> 00:55:15,155
He called me in a panic from France,

679
00:55:15,156 --> 00:55:18,875
said he needed to hide it for a few
hours while the loan shark
was sniffing around.

680
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:23,236
Why not tell me so?
He asked me to keep it quiet.

681
00:55:25,316 --> 00:55:28,196
Well, you're loyal to your friends,
at any rate.

682
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:31,316
Yeah. Better get on, Dad.

683
00:55:34,756 --> 00:55:36,756
Understood.

684
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:46,835
A hire firm at Luton Airport
reported the car stolen two days ago

685
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:50,235
when the hirer didn't turn up. I
faxed over the photo, just in case.

686
00:55:50,236 --> 00:55:53,396
We've got a name for the dead man,
then? Yep. Alec Grainger.

687
00:55:54,796 --> 00:55:57,636
He moved to Marbella from the UK
18 months ago.

688
00:55:58,436 --> 00:56:04,316
He's no model citizen, either. He's
got form for robbery, receiving,

689
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:07,036
deception with menaces...

690
00:56:08,716 --> 00:56:10,676
A-ha!

691
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:21,356
A penalty notice - speeding, just
outside Oxford, dated last month.

692
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:25,476
A copy of the appeal letter.

693
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:28,756
And he drives a classic Bentley.

694
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:33,476
Does he, now!

695
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:41,435
We need to talk.
You got me out of bed.

696
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:45,035
Would you rather Barnaby did?
Is this about the body they found?

697
00:56:45,036 --> 00:56:47,516
Don't ask questions. I didn't
sign up - Shut up and listen!

698
00:56:48,756 --> 00:56:51,396
That way, no-one else'll get hurt,
all right?

699
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:55,996
No... Sorry.
I don't recognise him, either.

700
00:56:56,356 --> 00:56:59,276
Well... how about this?

701
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:02,155
It's a late '50s S1 Continental.

702
00:57:02,156 --> 00:57:07,396
Exactly. Are you sure you've never
seen the car or the driver before?

703
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:15,396
Sure. OK. Well, thank you,
gentlemen. I'll leave you to get on.

704
00:57:18,796 --> 00:57:24,116
Splendid Bugatti! The Ferrari's
gone to a good home, I hope?

705
00:57:35,716 --> 00:57:38,395
Tidy these boxes, Sergeant, please.
Will do.

706
00:57:38,396 --> 00:57:42,515
I think that's everything you'll
need, sir. Thank you. Very good.
Just before you leave...

707
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:44,316
Sir?
Please...

708
00:57:47,116 --> 00:57:54,155
Your daughter tells us that James
Parkes ruined your career and hers.

709
00:57:54,156 --> 00:57:56,436
Is that true?
Layla is...

710
00:57:59,636 --> 00:58:04,796
You may not know, sir,
but my wife was the victim
of a hit-and-run accident.

711
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:09,396
Had it not been for Nina, her needs,

712
00:58:10,876 --> 00:58:13,196
I would have fought James
for that partnership.

713
00:58:14,636 --> 00:58:17,355
Layla doesn't want to blame her mum
for what happens...

714
00:58:17,356 --> 00:58:19,236
So she blames the Parkes for it.

715
00:58:20,756 --> 00:58:23,115
Even though the Colonel paid for
everything -

716
00:58:23,116 --> 00:58:26,276
private treatment,
conversions to the cottage...

717
00:58:26,956 --> 00:58:28,836
That was very generous of him.
Mm.

718
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:32,116
And the driver was never identified?
No.

719
00:58:33,996 --> 00:58:35,916
You had no suspicions?

720
00:58:39,036 --> 00:58:40,996
N-nope.

721
00:58:41,796 --> 00:58:45,676
Sergeant,
could you tell us, please, what you
really know about Alec Grainger?

722
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:49,156
I don't know anything.

723
00:58:50,076 --> 00:58:52,675
You are a man of conspicuous loyalty,

724
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:54,235
Sergeant Barkham,

725
00:58:54,236 --> 00:58:59,235
but you are a lousy liar!

726
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:00,435
But you are a lousy liar!

727
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:04,595
Ah, yes, I saw the man...

728
00:59:04,596 --> 00:59:07,876
Grainger... last Friday, with James.

729
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:12,116
Where?
At the yard, about six.

730
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:14,915
I heard angry voices

731
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:18,915
and I saw Grainger trying to push
something into James's hand -

732
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,836
a large envelope.

733
00:59:21,836 --> 00:59:23,796
Did you challenge him about it?

734
00:59:24,156 --> 00:59:26,036
Oh, he would have lied, if I had.

735
00:59:27,676 --> 00:59:32,356
I looked for the envelope the next
day, in his desk, but no sign.

736
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:38,636
I knew he'd bring trouble to us all
sooner or later, James Parkes.

737
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,595
Dad's out somewhere.

738
00:59:54,596 --> 00:59:57,075
Not looking for your dad, I'm looking
for you.

739
00:59:57,076 --> 01:00:01,075
Mr James Parkes,
I am arresting you
for questioning

740
01:00:01,076 --> 01:00:03,596
in connection
with the murder of Alec Grainger.

741
01:00:10,048 --> 01:00:14,448
I'm going to ask you again,
Mr Parkes, whether you've ever met
Alec Grainger.

742
01:00:16,288 --> 01:00:18,687
He's the father of a girl
I had a brief thing with.

743
01:00:18,688 --> 01:00:21,248
Met him once, not long after I got
back from France.

744
01:00:22,808 --> 01:00:25,967
And? Grainger turned up at the yard
last Friday

745
01:00:25,968 --> 01:00:28,608
claiming Susan had a toddler
in Spain that was mine.

746
01:00:29,488 --> 01:00:32,168
He was trying it on, by the way.
Nothing to do with me.

747
01:00:32,888 --> 01:00:35,807
Two young women you have a "thing"
with, both get pregnant

748
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:37,927
and none of
it's got anything to do with you

749
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:39,808
That's right.

750
01:00:41,288 --> 01:00:43,647
Can we get back to Friday, please?

751
01:00:43,648 --> 01:00:45,528
What happened next, Mr Parkes?

752
01:00:45,928 --> 01:00:47,807
Well, he turned up at the pub later,

753
01:00:47,808 --> 01:00:50,527
but I imagine that tart Layla's
already told you.

754
01:00:50,528 --> 01:00:52,687
Anyway, we walked into the woods
to talk.

755
01:00:52,688 --> 01:00:55,407
He wanted a grand a month
child support, he said,

756
01:00:55,408 --> 01:00:58,007
or his daughter was going to say
I raped her. I said no.

757
01:00:58,008 --> 01:00:59,928
He pulled a gun, we tussled. I ran
away.

758
01:01:00,168 --> 01:01:02,767
Did you know that Mr Grainger
had a criminal record?

759
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:06,568
It doesn't surprise me. He did have
a gun and a disagreeable manner.

760
01:01:08,608 --> 01:01:11,688
Did you have any other mutual
interests, apart from Susan?

761
01:01:12,888 --> 01:01:15,248
A kind of business, perhaps?
No.

762
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:21,407
When you say you "tussled"...?
I was trying to get the gun out of
his hand. He gave me the black eye.

763
01:01:21,408 --> 01:01:23,168
And what did you give him?
Nothing!

764
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:27,927
I mean, I may have landed the
odd punch. He fell backwards,

765
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:31,167
hit his head on a rock or something.
It gave me the chance to run away.

766
01:01:31,168 --> 01:01:33,927
He was alive when I left him.
Excuse me, sir.

767
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:35,728
What?
It's urgent.

768
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:44,728
Interview terminated at 12:52pm.

769
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:48,368
I don't think James Parkes is your
murderer, after all.

770
01:01:49,888 --> 01:01:54,128
And how did you work that one out?
I've identified two separate sets of
wounds.

771
01:01:54,568 --> 01:01:56,927
These facial bruises and abrasions

772
01:01:56,928 --> 01:02:00,127
were incurred a good hour before
the victim died. Most are slight.

773
01:02:00,128 --> 01:02:03,287
Now, these later
wounds are different:

774
01:02:03,288 --> 01:02:05,607
blows to the head delivered
with lethal force.

775
01:02:05,608 --> 01:02:07,527
Any idea about the murder weapon?

776
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:10,208
Something unforgiving, blunt...
Butt of a gun, perhaps?

777
01:02:11,008 --> 01:02:13,767
So James came back later and
polished Grainger off.

778
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:16,687
Except that from the angle of the
various blows,

779
01:02:16,688 --> 01:02:19,407
I'd say that
the first assailant was left-handed

780
01:02:19,408 --> 01:02:21,368
and the second,
the killer, right-handed.

781
01:02:25,528 --> 01:02:28,368
You're being bailed, not released,
Mr Parkes.

782
01:02:29,528 --> 01:02:31,487
Better stay out of trouble.

783
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:34,088
Is that an official warning
or a personal threat?

784
01:02:35,488 --> 01:02:37,648
Both.

785
01:02:48,608 --> 01:02:50,968
Thanks for all your help
with the police, Dad

786
01:02:52,488 --> 01:02:54,648
I can't stop them questioning you,
Jamie.

787
01:02:57,328 --> 01:03:00,408
They let you go, anyway.
Why wouldn't they? I didn't kill
Grainger.

788
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:06,088
Don't you realise, son, everything
comes with a cost?

789
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:10,408
Sooner or later, someone is going -
You still don't get it, do you, Dad?

790
01:03:11,128 --> 01:03:15,128
All your "truth, honour,
loyalty and morals" crap!

791
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:19,687
It's the bastards who get what they
want in this world,

792
01:03:19,688 --> 01:03:21,608
not the good guys.

793
01:03:31,968 --> 01:03:35,488
Terry! Yeah?
This could be interesting.

794
01:03:40,408 --> 01:03:42,328
What have you got there?

795
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:49,167
Get the ammunition boxes off and
stack them by the CP over there.

796
01:03:49,168 --> 01:03:53,367
Come on, lads.
Careful! Careful! Chop, chop!

797
01:03:53,368 --> 01:03:57,248
Soon as the tent's secure, get the
CP cammed up. That's it, Private.

798
01:03:57,928 --> 01:04:00,048
Let's get this show on the road!

799
01:04:01,448 --> 01:04:06,128
We should talk to Layla again, sir.
I'm surprised she hasn't told us
about seeing James and Grainger.

800
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:09,848
Uh-huh.
Nothing from France yet,

801
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:14,248
and nothing to connect James and
Grainger, either.

802
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:18,048
But he has been going back, though,
about once every eight weeks.

803
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,808
What about Grainger's daughter?

804
01:04:21,368 --> 01:04:24,128
Gail is trying to call her now
in Spain. Good.

805
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:26,648
Hey, look at this!

806
01:04:26,808 --> 01:04:28,728
There.

807
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:31,687
Grainger appealed that
speeding fine a month ago,

808
01:04:31,688 --> 01:04:33,687
on the grounds
that both he and his Bentley

809
01:04:33,688 --> 01:04:35,847
were not in the UK at the time.

810
01:04:35,848 --> 01:04:38,128
He's got a bill from a Spanish garage
as proof.

811
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:42,488
Speed camera proves he's lying.
Does it?

812
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:46,368
Thank you. James WAS lying, sir.

813
01:04:47,328 --> 01:04:49,687
Susan Grainger isn't a mother
or even pregnant.

814
01:04:49,688 --> 01:04:51,808
And there's something else...

815
01:05:00,128 --> 01:05:04,008
Coppers on the square, sir.
I'll come straight to the point with
you, Captain.

816
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:09,607
The dead man's daughter says
that he bought his Bentley

817
01:05:09,608 --> 01:05:11,847
- the one you'd never seen before -

818
01:05:11,848 --> 01:05:14,008
from you two years ago.

819
01:05:16,688 --> 01:05:18,568
Yes. I lied.

820
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:21,527
I should have
told you I knew him straight away.

821
01:05:21,528 --> 01:05:23,448
All right. Can we start again?

822
01:05:24,848 --> 01:05:27,327
Did you see Mr Grainger at any time

823
01:05:27,328 --> 01:05:29,527
on the day he died?

824
01:05:29,528 --> 01:05:31,928
He came to the workshop
that afternoon, about five.

825
01:05:33,088 --> 01:05:35,287
He was interested
in buying another car.

826
01:05:35,288 --> 01:05:37,687
I agreed to contact him,
if another one came up.

827
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:39,647
It's the last I saw of him, I
promise you.

828
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:43,207
We know that when he left you, he
went to visit James Parkes.

829
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:45,408
Do you know why he did that?
No, sorry.

830
01:05:46,688 --> 01:05:48,967
Where were you last Friday night?

831
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:52,007
I was in the workshop with Ed,
finishing off a job.

832
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:54,528
He'll verify that.
I'm sure he would.

833
01:05:56,648 --> 01:05:58,767
What car?

834
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:00,848
Sorry?
Was he looking for?

835
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:06,088
Oh, er...
Another Bentley. R-type coupe.

836
01:06:06,808 --> 01:06:08,728
Hard to find.

837
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:15,688
Platoon, atten-tion!

838
01:06:16,448 --> 01:06:19,087
Good effort, everyone.
It's 1600 now.

839
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:21,087
Meet back here at 1830.

840

Call the men out, Sergeant.
Sir. Platoon, fall out!

841
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:31,728
Aren't you late for work?
I called in sick.

859
01:07:35,128 --> 01:07:37,247
Have a look at this first, sir.
What?

860
01:07:37,248 --> 01:07:40,207
I scanned in that photo of the
speeding car and started diddling.

861
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:42,208
Oh, you started "diddling", did you?

Grainger's visit to James Parkes?

How? And why
cover it up with a paternity story?

Jamie was waiting for me outside the
pub this morning.

895
01:11:37,448 --> 01:11:40,768
He told me to meet him there, or
else. He wanted money.

896
01:11:41,808 --> 01:11:43,728
"Or else" what?

897
01:11:45,488 --> 01:11:50,128
Me and a friend, we've been going
into Causton at night, for business.

898
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:53,568
Oh, yes, the sex-for-money business.

899
01:11:55,528 --> 01:11:58,287
One night,
Jamie saw me with a punter.

900
01:11:58,288 --> 01:12:00,848
So he threatened to shop you
if you didn't give him money?

901
01:12:03,328 --> 01:12:06,008
Caroline saw me with him this
morning. I told her everything.

902
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,048
She said she'd go with me,
tell Jamie where to shove it!

903
01:12:11,768 --> 01:12:13,688
Penny insisted on coming too.

904
01:12:14,408 --> 01:12:16,728
I thought it was safer if I knew
where she was.

905
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:21,608
And what was YOUR intention,
Mrs Galsworthy?

906
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:24,568
I didn't go there to kill him.

907
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:28,968
I just wanted to see him off.

908
01:12:32,768 --> 01:12:35,008
We went to the hide, like he said.

909
01:12:36,808 --> 01:12:38,728
It was dark inside.

910
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,848
I tripped on some brambles
and fell right on top of him.

911
01:12:46,088 --> 01:12:48,008
It's the truth, Chief Inspector.

912
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:51,928
He was never the grandson
I would've wished for,

913
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:58,528
but this is not the... end
I would wish on anyone.

914
01:13:02,848 --> 01:13:06,248
Well, you'll all have to sign formal
statements before you're granted
bail.

915
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,247
In the meantime,
you'll be pleased to learn

916
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:11,328
you are all suspects
in a murder inquiry.

917
01:13:20,328 --> 01:13:23,647
He's been stabbed
with a sharp implement,
straight through the heart.

918
01:13:23,648 --> 01:13:25,447
Time of death?

919
01:13:25,448 --> 01:13:28,048
Well, he's barely cold. I'd say not
before 3:30 or after six.

920
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:34,007
What've you got there?
Murder weapon, sir. Gotta be.

921
01:13:34,008 --> 01:13:35,888
They found it 20 feet from the hut.

922
01:13:37,368 --> 01:13:39,647
That's an old Lewis clasp knife.

923
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:42,288
No soldier leaves home without one!
And this?

924
01:13:43,128 --> 01:13:46,368
SOCA found this in the wreckage of
the truck at Parkes's yard.

925
01:13:47,408 --> 01:13:49,728
I thought you might be interested.
Bugatti.

926
01:14:09,868 --> 01:14:12,467
You had a big win on the horses,
didn't you, Don,

927
01:14:12,468 --> 01:14:14,627
on the night of the explosion?

928
01:14:14,628 --> 01:14:17,787
Did I? There's nothing wrong
with that, is there?

929
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:20,667
No, no, but the young lady at the
betting shop

930
01:14:20,668 --> 01:14:23,988
told me just now that
you barely got your bet on in time.

931
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:26,748
So, the question, Don, is...

932
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:29,748
..who was minding the yard?

933
01:14:32,028 --> 01:14:33,948
Mr James was, sir.

934
01:14:50,588 --> 01:14:54,228
Where's Tom, Ben? His phone's off.
I don't know.
I'm waiting for a call.

935
01:14:54,988 --> 01:14:57,948
So where are you going?
Have a... Toilet, sir.

936
01:14:58,588 --> 01:15:01,988
Ask him to call me, will you?
Yes, sir - John - sir!

937
01:15:13,188 --> 01:15:15,107
What are you doing here, sir?

938
01:15:15,108 --> 01:15:17,547
You mean, "Why are we going back to
the arson case

939
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:20,587
when we've got two unsolved murders
on our hands?", don't you?

940
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:22,868
Well that... that's a fair question,
Jones.

941
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:25,387
And is there an answer?
Yes, there is.

942
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:27,547
I should have made
the connection earlier...

943
01:15:27,548 --> 01:15:30,628
between Dale's runs to Marseilles,

944
01:15:31,428 --> 01:15:33,507
the speeding car in Oxford

945
01:15:33,508 --> 01:15:35,747
- that wasn't Grainger's Bentley,
by the way -

946
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:38,348
and Galsworthy's
classic-car business.

947
01:15:39,788 --> 01:15:42,707
I don't understand, sir.
You don't? Well, neither did I.

948
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:45,707
Not until I saw the...
the hubcap from the Bugatti

949
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,787
that the Forensics dug out of
this lot.

950
01:15:47,788 --> 01:15:50,748
Hang on, hang on, hang on. Could you
rewind a bit, please?

951
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:55,387
Grainger bought his Bentley from
Galsworthy.

952
01:15:55,388 --> 01:15:57,627
It was a perfectly
legitimate transaction.

953
01:15:57,628 --> 01:16:01,867
But then he gets a speeding fine
for an offence committed in Oxford,

954
01:16:01,868 --> 01:16:04,867
on a day when he knew that both he
and his Bentley were in Spain.

955
01:16:04,868 --> 01:16:09,028
And yet the speed camera showed a car
identical to his own.

956
01:16:09,788 --> 01:16:12,867
So he smelt a rat and came to Calham
Cross to sniff it out. Yeah.

957
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:15,907
Now, he visited James Parkes and
Galsworthy

958
01:16:15,908 --> 01:16:19,907
and concluded - correctly -
they were both somehow involved

959
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:25,147
in stealing his car's identity to
launder similar stolen vehicles
in the UK.

960
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:27,388
Here, look, have a look at this.
Come on!

961
01:16:28,228 --> 01:16:31,788
So he's spotted the work of a fellow
villain and tried to muscle in?

962
01:16:34,148 --> 01:16:37,868
And where was the stolen car stolen?
France?

963
01:16:38,388 --> 01:16:41,827
Exactement!
And shipped back in bits to the UK

964
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:44,828
in this - in Dale Mitchinson's lorry.

965
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,188
Look!

966
01:16:50,108 --> 01:16:52,668
'Behind a false panel.'

967
01:16:56,588 --> 01:16:58,867
So if you're right...
What do you mean, "if"?

968
01:16:58,868 --> 01:17:01,747
..and Captain Galsworthy's up to his
neck in the car scam,

969
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:04,428
doesn't that make him and Lovell
suspects for both murders?

970
01:17:07,788 --> 01:17:12,947
I'm quite prepared to believe that,
until James Parkes came back to
Calham Cross a couple of years ago,

971
01:17:12,948 --> 01:17:16,868
you ran a successful and perfectly
legitimate business.

972
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:21,948
Yes, I did... but things went
totally to pot when Gilly died.

973
01:17:23,188 --> 01:17:25,148
I cancelled jobs... Lost some...

974
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,467
And then Jamie turned up
with a car in bits

975
01:17:28,468 --> 01:17:31,748
and a thin story about a friend
who wanted it restored for cash.

976
01:17:32,388 --> 01:17:35,508
Six weeks later, there was another
car. And then another.

977
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:39,628
And you provided those stolen cars
with false identities, yeah?

978
01:17:40,748 --> 01:17:43,668
Identities stolen from people like...
Alec Grainger.

979
01:17:45,148 --> 01:17:49,108
When his body was found, we
were sure that James must have
killed him.

980
01:17:49,788 --> 01:17:51,708
Neither of us are murderers,
Mr Barnaby.

981
01:17:52,788 --> 01:17:57,708
But you are trained killers, aren't
you? And bomb makers.

982
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,388
I planted the bomb.

983
01:18:06,668 --> 01:18:10,147
The Captain was trapped.
There was no digging himself out
with Jamie Parkes!

984
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:12,147
Don't panic, I've got it all sorted.

985
01:18:12,148 --> 01:18:16,348
I thought if I could make the
Colonel ask more questions about
what was going on...

986
01:18:18,388 --> 01:18:21,107
Dale always stops for his breakfast
at the cafe

987
01:18:21,108 --> 01:18:24,708
and when they've got
a special delivery, that's where
James meets him.

988
01:18:25,748 --> 01:18:27,747
That day, there'd been a road
closure.

989
01:18:27,748 --> 01:18:30,908
They couldn't get the truck to their
regular unloading spot.

990
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:38,068
So they had to do it in the yard.

991
01:18:38,828 --> 01:18:41,947
They drove it back to Dale's and
delivered it here that evening.

992
01:18:41,948 --> 01:18:45,308
You do know you could've killed
Don Mitchinson?

993
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:49,707
There was a small risk, Chief
Inspector.

994
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:53,307
Acting Chief Superintendent Cotton
will agree with me when I say

995
01:18:53,308 --> 01:18:58,427
that your lines of communication
have strengthened throughout the
day...

996
01:18:58,428 --> 01:19:01,948
'But I phoned the watchman's hut to
try and make sure he was out of the
way in time.'

997
01:19:05,468 --> 01:19:07,788
All right! All right!

998
01:19:12,468 --> 01:19:15,268
"Hello, Parkes Freight. Hello?"

999
01:19:34,028 --> 01:19:38,748
So you blew up the truck, but that
didn't stop James Parkes, did it?

1000
01:19:43,668 --> 01:19:47,268
Where were you both between four
and 6:30 yesterday afternoon?

1001
01:19:48,988 --> 01:19:51,708
We finished the preparations
at the woods by four.

1002
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:54,668
Back to the house for supper,
back to the woods for 6:30.

1003
01:19:55,188 --> 01:19:57,108
Can any anyone confirm that?

1004
01:20:00,668 --> 01:20:03,668
I am ready to pay for what I've
done. We both are.

1005
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:07,788
But we did NOT murder James.

1006
01:20:08,908 --> 01:20:11,468
I think he's telling you
the truth, Inspector.

1007
01:20:12,348 --> 01:20:14,468
Tim confessed everything to me
this morning.

1008
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:18,148
I told him I'd leave him if
he didn't.

1009
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:25,108
He swears he didn't murder anyone.
That is hearsay, that's not proof.

1010
01:20:25,468 --> 01:20:28,468
But I saw him and Ed arrive
back from the wood.

1011
01:20:42,108 --> 01:20:44,708
Me, sir? Go on, Jones.

1012
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:48,668
Yes, sir?

1013
01:20:50,148 --> 01:20:54,228
No time sheets. And no suspects,
either. Am I right, Tom?

1014
01:20:55,788 --> 01:21:00,147
Well, we have solved the arson case,
sir, and exposed a car-theft ring.

1015
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:02,867
What about the two outstanding
murders?

1016
01:21:02,868 --> 01:21:06,987
How many people have you
interviewed? How many pieces of
evidence have you collected?

1017
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:10,467
Are you duplicating tasks? If you'd
been filling in your timesheets -

1018
01:21:10,468 --> 01:21:14,148
We haven't had time to fill
in the timesheets, sir.

1019
01:21:15,748 --> 01:21:18,947
This is my last day -
Yes, I know, and I was hoping, sir,

1020
01:21:18,948 --> 01:21:21,148
to have the murderer behind bars
by suppertime.

1021
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,388
Thank you, sir!

1022
01:21:47,108 --> 01:21:50,748
What did the Boy Wonder want?
He wanted to enlighten me.

1023
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:54,987
But I may avoid that fate,

1024
01:21:54,988 --> 01:21:58,987
if we can make arrests
for the murders before
Father Christmas arrives.

1025
01:21:58,988 --> 01:22:03,508
Well, there's good news. The knife
we found belongs to George Barkham.

1026
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,548
Initials are etched into it.

1027
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:09,467
And the bad news? It's not the knife
that killed James Parkes.

1028
01:22:09,468 --> 01:22:11,428
The blade doesn't match the wounds.

1029
01:22:15,948 --> 01:22:18,548
We may have the key to the case here.

1030
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:23,428
How does not having the murder
weapon help us crack the case, sir?

1031
01:22:24,908 --> 01:22:31,588
Leadership, loyalty and love. They
can be three very dangerous things.

1032
01:22:34,228 --> 01:22:36,268
One, two, three.

1033
01:22:37,788 --> 01:22:39,628
Oh!

1034
01:23:27,948 --> 01:23:30,508
You should go home to your family
now, Sergeant.

1035
01:23:30,988 --> 01:23:33,948
I'd rather stay with you, sir.
Family understands.

1036
01:23:36,748 --> 01:23:38,708
You're a good man, George.

1037
01:23:40,428 --> 01:23:42,348
My son...

1038
01:23:47,268 --> 01:23:51,108
..was not a good man.
You looked for the best in him, sir.

1039
01:23:51,948 --> 01:23:54,028
What any good father would do.
I let him down.

1040
01:23:57,188 --> 01:23:59,228
I let us all down.
That's not true, sir.

1041
01:24:04,388 --> 01:24:07,108
You're here to arrest me for the
murders? Yes.

1042
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:10,668
No, wait... I told you, it was me,
my knife. The Colonel - George!

1043
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:26,348
My sword, Chief Inspector.

1044
01:24:46,634 --> 01:24:48,954
It was about 11:30
last Friday night.

1045
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:55,074
I was in my study.
Jamie burst in, covered in blood.

1046
01:24:56,154 --> 01:24:58,074
Said he'd been attacked in the woods

1047
01:24:59,354 --> 01:25:02,394
and um... and killed a man,

1048
01:25:04,874 --> 01:25:06,794
who was a violent criminal.

1049
01:25:07,714 --> 01:25:10,554
I went to the woods
to find the body.

1050
01:25:11,994 --> 01:25:13,914
But he wasn't dead, was he?

1051
01:25:15,474 --> 01:25:17,514
'I needed to believe, you see.'

1052
01:25:19,634 --> 01:25:22,113
'The man was a blackmailer,
a killer.

1053
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:24,474
He'd pulled a gun,
he tried to kill Jamie.

1054
01:25:27,594 --> 01:25:31,954
It was self-defence. All I was doing
was protecting my son's innocence.'

1055
01:25:35,754 --> 01:25:37,354
And myself.

1056
01:25:57,204 --> 01:26:00,004
I had the toolbox in my van.

1057
01:26:02,964 --> 01:26:07,164
'So you put the body in that toolbox
and dragged it to the lake.'

1058
01:26:15,564 --> 01:26:18,444
Then you dumped his possessions
somewhere, and his car.

1059
01:26:21,564 --> 01:26:26,764
I hoped the experience would scare
Jamie - finally teach him a lesson.

1060
01:26:29,324 --> 01:26:32,764
But er...
The fire.

1061
01:26:35,604 --> 01:26:40,884
I'd noticed a van parked
in the garage the afternoon before.

1062
01:26:42,604 --> 01:26:48,964
I asked Jamie
about it. As always, he had
quick answers to all my questions.

1063
01:26:52,044 --> 01:26:53,924
I was nearly convinced.

1064
01:26:55,404 --> 01:27:00,604
'But then your Forensics people
found the hubcap of the Bugatti.'

1065
01:27:03,044 --> 01:27:07,564
And then? I'd seen you talking to Tim
down by the lake.

1066
01:27:08,164 --> 01:27:10,564
I guessed he must be involved
somehow, so...

1067
01:27:14,924 --> 01:27:16,963
..so I confronted him.

1068
01:27:16,964 --> 01:27:18,804
Captain.
Colonel.

1069
01:27:19,524 --> 01:27:23,483
I'm depending on your integrity
as an officer and a gentleman,

1070
01:27:23,484 --> 01:27:28,324
in light of the current situation,
to tell me what's going on.

1071
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:32,964
But when I found out how many lies
he'd told,

1072
01:27:34,044 --> 01:27:37,004
that he'd exploited the innocent
as well as the guilty...

1073
01:27:45,004 --> 01:27:46,924
..I called Jamie,

1074
01:27:48,284 --> 01:27:51,564
asked him to meet me in the hide
before the exercise began.

1075
01:27:52,444 --> 01:27:56,364
Sir, when you went into the woods,

1076
01:27:57,484 --> 01:27:59,404
did you intend to kill him?

1077
01:28:03,564 --> 01:28:05,484
No...

1078
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:10,044
I wanted him to give himself up.

1079
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:24,963
So, I'm here. Make it snappy, Dad.

1080
01:28:24,964 --> 01:28:28,123
I've got to go away for a few days.
Don't worry, I'll be back.

1081
01:28:28,124 --> 01:28:30,044
I've talked to Tim.

1082
01:28:32,764 --> 01:28:35,164
So? We're in business.

1083
01:28:36,604 --> 01:28:39,484
You're a fraud, Jamie, and a thief.

1084
01:28:40,484 --> 01:28:45,283
And you've turned Tim and Ed Lovell
and Dale into criminals, too!

1085
01:28:45,284 --> 01:28:47,323
- Oh, yeah?
- Did that all by myself, did I

1086
01:28:47,324 --> 01:28:50,124
This ends now.
Leave me alone, old man!

1087
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:56,084
We're going to the police. I'm going
back to France. Not this time!

1088
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:59,203
Dad, just let the hell go of me!

1089
01:28:59,204 --> 01:29:02,043
Your mother was the very best of
people. I don't want to hear it.

1090
01:29:02,044 --> 01:29:04,004
How's it possible you're the worst?

1091
01:29:05,764 --> 01:29:09,764
And you don't even know the half of
it do you, eh? Or do you?

1092
01:29:12,524 --> 01:29:14,803
What do you mean, Jamie?

1093
01:29:14,804 --> 01:29:17,483
All those
good works
for the Barkhams after the accident.

1094
01:29:17,484 --> 01:29:19,883
Was that really out of the goodness
of your heart?

1095
01:29:19,884 --> 01:29:21,843
Or because
you couldn't bear the thought

1096
01:29:21,844 --> 01:29:24,524
that it might just have been me
who knocked her down?

1097
01:29:25,404 --> 01:29:29,444
Oh, no! Jamie...

1098
01:29:32,804 --> 01:29:34,724
I'll be seeing you, old man.

1099
01:29:43,274 --> 01:29:44,914
NO!

1100
01:29:55,274 --> 01:29:57,194
Your transport's ready, Colonel.

1101
01:30:04,554 --> 01:30:07,234
Don't pity me, will you, Barnaby?

1102
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,074
No, sir.

1103
01:30:15,954 --> 01:30:18,354
Oh, Matt, I'm so very sorry.

1104
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:21,954
I was wrong about him.

1105
01:30:24,474 --> 01:30:26,354
And you have nothing
to feel sorry about.

1106
01:30:29,234 --> 01:30:31,194
If only that were true!

1107
01:30:43,954 --> 01:30:47,873
The difference between a parent's
love and a grandparent's

1108
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:50,794
is that a grandparent's
is not unconditional!

1109
01:30:57,034 --> 01:31:00,514
Well, that's my Christmas Eve
stuffed the wrong way up the
chimney, sir.

1110
01:31:01,434 --> 01:31:06,194
How about yours?
No, no! With me.

1111
01:31:07,554 --> 01:31:09,553
Paperwork.

1112
01:31:09,554 --> 01:31:13,754

1117
01:31:35,154 --> 01:31:39,953

Yes, sir, I'm sorry. But we have,
