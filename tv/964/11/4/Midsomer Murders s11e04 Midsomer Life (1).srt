1
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:27,204
Well done. Right!
I'll take that. On to work.

2
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:29,484
If the bumpkins were left
to their own devices,

3
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:32,124
all these byways would be overgrown,
mate.

4
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:34,244
Here you are.
Just down here would be lovely.

5
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,804
Hold up.

6
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,764
Wow, mate, look at that!
Shh!

7
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:25,444
About ten minutes ago. We need you
here as soon as possible - ASAP.

8
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:34,964
We've done a PNC check.
The vehicle's registered to
a Charlie Finleyson of London.

9
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,724
He used to live in Midsomer Sonning
up until three years ago.

10
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:40,964
George thought you might know him.
Morning, George. I know of him.

11
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:44,844
His wife reported him missing
two weeks ago. No obvious cause.

12
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:49,204
Time of death was something like two
weeks ago, judging by the insect
development.

13
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,924
Broken from the outside.
No wallet or ID.

14
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:56,644
The way the glass has interacted
with the body,

15
00:04:56,644 --> 00:05:00,284
it looks like the window was broken
at the time of death, or soon after.

16
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:04,484
Well, he certainly wanted to turn
round in a hurry, didn't he?

17
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:10,364
What he was he doing here,
with his Chelsea tractor
and his designer suit?

18
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:13,444
Not your typical birdwatcher, is he?

19
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:18,124
Miles from anywhere...
with a map and a pair of binoculars.

20
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:22,044
Do you know who lives barely half
a mile away? Guy Sandys.

21
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:25,364
Guy Sandys, owner of Midsomer Life?

22
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:28,204
It also happens
it was Guy Sandys' wife

23
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:31,284
who Charlie Finleyson ran off with
three years ago.

24
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:40,044
Mm. You're a very talented girl,
Gemma.

25
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:46,204
I thought it was perhaps a little
gruesome for the gentle folk of
Midsomer?

26
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:50,284
We have to tell it how it is, Julia.
That's what we're here for.

27
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:54,124
We'll go with it as it is.
Thank you, Mr Sandys.

28
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:04,364
Oh, Garth, come in.
Excellent article this month.

29
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:09,324
Thank you, Mr Sandys. So, um...
how's the hedge-laying going?

30
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:13,244
Not much work about, as it happens.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

31
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:18,004
In fact, I started a new job today.

32
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,284
When you hear who I'm working for,

33
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:23,764
I'm not sure you're going to want me
writing the country diaries any more.

34
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:26,964
If Guy Sandys thinks he's going
to publish this rubbish,

35
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:30,284
then he's got another thing coming.
Who the hell does he think he is?

36
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:32,524
Looks like it's going to be one of
his nasty ones.

37
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:35,684
It's ever since you opened
that off-road centre, you know.

38
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:40,324
That's what this is all about.
I know what this is about
and I'm not going to put up with it.

39
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,204
The opinions of
that dyspeptic dinosaur bastard!

40
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:59,084
Mr Tomlin, any plans for the...day?

41
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,924
No. Right.

42
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,924
It'd been sitting there
for two weeks, or something!

43
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,004
I mean, don't these people
ever clear up?

44
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:46,284
This is a public byway
we're talking about!

45
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,804
Yes, please. I mean,
we could've had kiddies with us!

46
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,564
Mr Farley.
Did you have a pleasant drive?

47
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,484
You extracting the Michael

48
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:58,644
I beg your pardon?

49
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,524
Have you not heard about the body we
found up on the hill?

50
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,604
The dead body, mm?

51
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:11,364
Blimey! I thought gossip
was supposed to spread like wildfire
in these parts!

52
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,844
- I think it's Remys all round.
- Yeah.

53
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,004
Large ones.
Of course.

54
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:24,204
Morecroft bar, usual time?
Right, see you later.

55
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:47,244
So, we were doing a bit of
green-laning up the back there

56
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:51,284
and we had to hack our way through,
and then...there it was.

57
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:54,484
Maggots crawling all over it!

58
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,884
Yeah, all right.
Sorry.

59
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:00,884
Where...where was this?
Um... Up the back there.

60
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:03,764
Erm...
I think it's called...Drays Copse.

61
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:06,044
Drays Copse? Drays Copse?

62
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,564
- What's that?
- The haunted wood, is it

63
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:18,484
What are you like, you people!
Priceless!

64
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:26,444
They're saying it's a combination
of that hot weekend and it being
the end of the season.

65
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,884
Can't get charcoal anywhere.

66
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:34,044
No, it'll be fine. They say
it's going to be an Indian summer.

67
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:36,604
Ooh, there's your dad now.

68
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:40,284
Cully sends her love.
Oh, Mrs Dixon!

69
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,364
Hello, Cully, love!
Did you get that?

70
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:47,924
Yeah. Yeah, see you then.

71
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,684
Bye, love.

72
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:52,604
Simon can't come, after all.

73
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:56,924
They're not avoiding the in-laws
already, are they?
No, course not. Don't be silly.

74
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:01,204
Now, have you decided
what you'd like for your birthday?

75
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:03,884
I've just walked through the door.
Could I have a moment,

76
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,964
before you start all the questioning?

77
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:09,604
You are, without doubt,

78
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:12,764
the most difficult person
in the world to buy a present for.

79
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,484
Come on.

80
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:38,204
Well, I never realised
there was so much money
in local-magazine publishing.

81
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,764
There isn't. Guy Sandys made his
money in the City, retired early

82
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:43,844
and bought the magazine as a hobby.

83
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,524
Now, the crime scene's over there,

84
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:50,164
and this is the only house within
a mile of where the body was found.

85
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:13,484
Their faces went pale,
and then they went silent.

86
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:17,164
It was like American Werewolf In
London, you know.

87
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:20,524
Like, "Don't stray off the path,"
sort of thing, you know.

88
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:23,564
"Woo! Drays Copse!"
Bleedin' hilarious.

89
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:26,804
Ooh, I like those spots!
That's tungsten, that is.

90
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,684
Very nice!

91
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,604
What...is...that?

92
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,404
Oi, mate!
They've called and left a message.

93
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:46,804
- Who?
-  The Transport Museum - want to know if you're were ready to donate it yet

94
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,204
Mrs Finleyson?
Yes.

95
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,604
Would you come through, please?

96
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,844
Is it my husband?

97
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:32,484
We've checked the dental records
and I...I have to tell you

98
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:35,444
that the deceased is, indeed,
your husband. I'm sorry.

99
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,164
Cause of death hasn't been
established yet,

100
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:47,284
but I'm bound to tell you
there are certain circumstances
which are...suspicious.

101
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,204
Thank you.

102
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,444
We need to know what he was doing
where he was found,

103
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:58,244
and that was on the bridle path
that runs through Drays Copse.

104
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:02,004
I have no idea
what he was doing there.

105
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:06,924
You do know where Drays Copse is,
don't you? Of course I do.

106
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:09,284
It's 500 yards
from my ex-husband's house.

107
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:13,724
I'd quite like to know what Charlie
was doing there myself.

108
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:23,524
I'm off to the Green Dragon.

109
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:25,724
Matt Morecroft's
been on the phone again.

110
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:29,884
More threats about cancelling
his advertising if you go ahead
with next month's review.

111
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:32,324
Well, leave it to me.
Have you got his contract?

112
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:37,604
Thank you.

113
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:40,524
See you later.
Bon appetit!

114
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:48,564
My brother Martin works
at the Morecroft Hotel

115
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:51,044
and he phoned and told me
that they'd found a body.

116
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:54,244
Can you tell us about the last time
that you saw your husband?

117
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:57,804
It was the morning he disappeared.

118
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,604
We were sitting at home
in Kensington.

119
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:03,924
He was eating some cereal. I left
early in order to beat the traffic.

120
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,084
I assumed
he'd just gone to the office.

121
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:11,964
And you've no idea what he was doing
in Midsomer? No. Not one single clue.

122
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,764
Will there be an inquest, do you
think? Oh, yes, there will be.

123
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,684
We'll have to talk to you again.

124
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:24,604
Ben... Can I have a word?
Yep.

125
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:27,444
It was while we were
looking over the SUV,

126
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,684
found something we thought
might be of interest.

127
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:35,364
And if you could keep us informed
about your movements...

128
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:38,324
This is my brother's address.
I'll be staying there tonight.

129
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,684
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

130
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:50,524
What's that? Found down the side of
the seat in Charlie Finleyson's SUV.

131
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:55,124
It's a credit-card statement
in the name of CHRISTINA Finleyson,
with one entry circled.

132
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:57,204
A service station
in Midsomer Sonning.

133
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,964
He was checking up on her.

134
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,252
Where's my glass?
It's there, somewhere.

135
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:26,132
If you'd just leave it
where I put it! I didn't touch it.

136
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:30,612
And you don't want to. The last
person that touched Eleanor's glass

137
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:33,612
- is still eating through a straw!
- Thank you

138
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,452
Christina...

139
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,332
It WAS Charlie.

140
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,372
I am so, so sorry.
Charlie?

141
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:50,692
What, the body in the car
was your husband Charlie?

142
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:55,612
Do you think you could give us
a moment? Yes, of course.

143
00:15:57,212 --> 00:16:00,332
I should've known. I mean,
he hadn't used his credit cards,

144
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,772
the bank account was untouched...
It was obvious.

145
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,612
Do they know how?
No, not yet.

146
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:12,212
Well, I shall miss him. I mean, he
was such a lovely, kind and warm...

147
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,772
Well, I don't know -
such a genuine human being.

148
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:18,252
He just always had time
for everyone. I mean - Martin...

149
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:20,972
Mm?
Sorry, can I ask you something?

150
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:24,852
Oh, please. Anything.
What on earth possessed you
to get a job as a barman?

151
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:29,852
Well, I've tried
quite a few jobs since... You know.

152
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:33,812
Once you're the wrong side of 40,
it's actually not very - Yes, OK.

153
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:39,372
Look, do you have
a spare front-door key? Use mine.

154
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:44,932
You know you're welcome to stay
as long as you like. Thank you.

155
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,092
Mr Tomlin...

156
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:58,932
Have there been any telephone
messages for me?

157
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:02,652
No, not that I'm aware of.
You're absolutely sure?

158
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:07,492
All messages are put
in the pigeonholes at reception,
if you'd like to check.

159
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:17,092
What a peculiar man!

160
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:22,572
In fact, if he had anything to do
with what happened to your
brother-in-law,

161
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:25,052
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

162
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,972
What's that?

163
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:49,612
Of course! Your old restaurant got
one of Guy's reviews, didn't it?

164
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:51,972
Is this the one? Hm?

165
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:55,692
Oh! How extraordinary! It's fallen
open just at the right page.

166
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:58,172
Crimes Against Gastronomy.

167
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:05,572
Could you look after the till for
a moment, please? Yes, of course.

168
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:18,452
Oh, dear!

169
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:23,332
A confection of overworked
pretentiousness...

170
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:29,132
An amateur cook with all the
culinary instinct of a lollipop...

171
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,612
'Vile sludge!'
..sludge.

172
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:52,932
So it's really just a matter of
towing them out if they get stuck.

173
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,612
And for God's sake,
don't give them any advice.

174
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,852
City boys don't like
being told what to do.

175
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:01,012
It's all about making them feel good.

176
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,892
And don't come over
all Countryside Alliance.

177
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:09,812
They come here to relax
and we look after them.

178
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,852
Did you divert the stream through
the old tip that was there? Yeah.

179
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:17,652
We put a hard core in the bottom.
It works fine.

180
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,852
Mrs Finleyson!

181
00:19:50,612 --> 00:19:53,412
Hello? Mrs Finleyson?

182
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:10,452
Good afternoon. You didn't answer.

183
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:14,692
I was hoping you'd go away,
if I'm perfectly honest.

184
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:22,812
We've got some new evidence,
Mrs Finleyson,

185
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:26,132
which I hoped you could
throw some light on for us,

186
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:31,012
if you'd be so kind. This is a
credit-card statement in your name.

187
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:35,172
It was found down the side of one of
the seats in your husband's Lexus 44.

188
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:38,132
You see that circled entry?

189
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:43,052
That was for a purchase at the petrol
station in Midsomer Sonning.

190
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:47,332
Do you know why that particular entry
was circled?

191
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:50,812
Well, it wasn't circled by me.
I know that.

192
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:54,932
Was it not?

193
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:59,012
Do you know any reason why your
husband would be, erm, curious...

194
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:03,212
..about what you were doing
out here in Midsomer Sonning?

195
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:09,532
Mrs Finleyson, can you tell me,
please, where you were on the day
your husband disappeared?

196
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:13,292
I was here, seeing my brother.

197
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:17,092
Didn't I mention that?

198
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:23,932
You see, I had driven down
from London to help Martin
with his finances.

199
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:28,772
Ever since his restaurant went into
receivership, he's been finding it
very difficult to cope.

200
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:32,572
Oh, so you've come back here before?
A couple of times.

201
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:36,692
Once on the day
of the petrol-station entry.

202
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:40,972
I didn't tell Charlie,
because my brother asked me not to.

203
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:44,052
He's been embarrassed by his
situation.

204
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:48,932
Has the cause of death been
established yet? No, it hasn't.

205
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:52,332
You know,
Charlie had high blood pressure.

206
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:57,492
But I can think of no reason why
he should suspect I was seeing Guy.

207
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:00,452
The idea is ridiculous.

208
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:04,972
Now, if you don't mind, I've got
things I need to get on with.

209
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:14,452
I'm afraid he's out at the moment.
Is it about the body they found
up at Drays Copse?

210
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:16,532
It is. Do you know
where I can find -

211
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:18,452
Is it true it was Charlie Finleyson?

212
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:23,452
I had hoped I'd be the one
asking the questions. Sorry.

213
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:26,372
Habit of a lifetime.
Where can I find Mr Sandys?

214
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,732
'He's at the Green Dragon in Malham.
It's gastro-pub review day.'

215
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:34,572
There you go.

216
00:22:39,372 --> 00:22:41,932
I will not be needing
the...parachute.

217
00:22:42,732 --> 00:22:45,452
I will, however, be needing
the seasonal vegetables

218
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:47,612
which, I think,
are included in the menu,

219
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:49,412
if you don't mind.

220
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:02,732
Morecroft Hotel. WOMAN: "Could
I speak with Mr Tomlin, please?"

221
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:05,332
I'm afraid he's not here
at the moment. Can I take a message?

222
00:23:05,972 --> 00:23:08,772
"Could you tell him Mrs Wilson
returned his call?"

223
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,332
And your number is?
"He has my number.

224
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:13,292
Just ask him to call."

225
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:42,772
I mean, I don't even know
what all the hostility's about,
do you know what I mean?

226
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:46,612
I mean the countryside is supposed
to be a leisure resource
for everybody, right?

227
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:48,412
Oi!

228
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:51,292
Excuse me!

229
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:58,052
There's a farmer who has
deliberately put a load of bulls
in a field we wanted to go through.

230
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:01,292
Now, a bridlepath is a public right
of way. Why would he do that?

231
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:06,292
Where was this? It was in a field
at the Malham crossroads.

232
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:09,292
I think you'll find they were cows.

233
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,572
Cows?

234
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,212
When was the last time
you saw cows with horns?

235
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:44,132
Mr Guy Sandys?
Yes?

236
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:48,412
Sorry to interrupt your meal.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Barnaby, Causton CID

237
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,412
and this is Detective Sergeant Jones.

238
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:54,612
We need to ask you a few questions,
Sir. Er...may we?

239
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:58,012
Please.
Thank you.

240
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:08,292
You haven't heard, have you,
about the body that's been found
in Drays Copse? No, I haven't.

241
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:12,372
What body?
It was found in an SUV.

242
00:25:13,452 --> 00:25:16,972
It's just been positively identified
as being that of Charlie Finleyson.

243
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,092
Finleyson?

244
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:25,132
Well, I can tell you it had
absolutely nothing to do with me.

245
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:28,492
I can't think what he was doing down
here. I haven't seen the man for
years.

246
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,212
Thank you.

247
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:35,612
Why do they always

248
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:39,012
bring the vegetables and the pie
on two separate plates? Does anyone
know?

249
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:41,572
Either I have to eat them
separately,

250
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:46,172
or transport the vegetables
to the pie, having first made a hole
in the pastry to put them in,

251
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:48,772
or vice versa and dribble gravy
all over the table.

252
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:52,172
Why can't they just put them on the
same plate? Mmm!

253
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:57,412
Actually, that's not bad.

254
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:00,452
Charlie Finleyson, sir?

255
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:08,132
He disappeared a couple of
weeks ago. Tuesday the third.

256
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:10,332
On that date,
or any time since that date,

257
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:13,012
have you seen or heard anything
unusual near to your house

258
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:14,892
or along the bridle path?

259
00:26:15,212 --> 00:26:17,052
I don't think I was at home
that day.

260
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:20,052
No, I wasn't. Or that night.

261
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:23,772
I had meetings in town
and stayed over.

262
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:27,412
Sorry.

263
00:26:50,572 --> 00:26:52,492
Is Matt here?

264
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,772
Afraid not, Mr Sandys. Can I help?

265
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:58,172
Well, if it isn't the old school tie
himself

266
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:02,932
Do I know you?
Probably not.

267
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:06,812
The grandee fund managers never had
much time for us common folk.

268
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:10,092
I remember you.
The paint-ball champion!

269
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:14,772
- And what's wrong with paint-balling?
- Nothing.

270
00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:20,572
You want to watch what you say,
mate. You haven't got your school
chums to back you up here.

271
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,332
That's enough, thank you.

272
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:26,292
Are you mistaking yourself
for someone of any consequence
whatsoever

273
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:29,372
Come on, Brad, leave 'em alone.
They're not worth it.

274
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,652
You're lucky there's ladies present,
mate.

275
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:37,172
Eh?

276
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:40,172
Yeah.

277
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,572
No surprises about the clientele,
then

278
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,492
Perhaps you could take a message
to your new employer?

279
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,332
Tell him the advertising contract
is void

280
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,332
and I WILL be publishing
next month's review.

281
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:57,372
Henceforward, the magazine refuses

282
00:27:57,372 --> 00:28:02,612
to carry any further advertisements
for his hotel - at any price. Ever!

283
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:05,812
I'll pass that on, Mr Sandys.
Thank you, Garth.

284
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:53,092
What the hell was your husband doing
at Drays Copse?

285
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,212
Sensitive and charming, as ever

286
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:58,332
Thank you for the sympathy
What was he doing here?

287
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:02,132
Well, you tell me! What on earth
would I want with a prat like that?

288
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:04,892
I've told you, he's a waste of
space! Oh, you bastard!

289
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:13,132
Thanks.

290
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:20,732
Hey, how's the new job?
Interesting.

291
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:23,452
Good evening.

292
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,492
Give us a minute.

293
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,892
He's going to what?

294
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,852
Right... Right, we'll see.

295
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,612
Matt, is there anything
I can do to help?

296
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:59,852
Have the new towels been laundered?
That's not actually my job.

297
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,092
Don't you like working here?

298
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:34,692
You've got that "Salvador Dali
moustache" look again.

299
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:38,532
In purple.

300
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:42,012
It's the Merlot smile.
Oh.

301
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,412
Eleanor... Mm?
Safe journey home.

302
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:07,972
Oh, pot holes!
They should get them fixed.

303
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:32,292
Hello?

304
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:34,732
Hello!

305
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:43,612
Oi, media baron! What have you got
in store for The Morecroft?

306
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:51,332
What little nuggets
of unpleasantness? Come on,
you can tell me!

307
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,969
- Yes?
- "Is Mr Tomlin there, please?"

308
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,209
Just a moment.

309
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:44,089
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
he doesn't appear to be answering.

310
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,889
"Could you ask him to phone
Mrs Wilson? He has my number."

311
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:49,889
Well, I have actually
already given him that message.

312
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:52,489
"Could you make sure he gets it!"

313
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,169
On his own spike!

314
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,649
Someone making a "point", perhaps?

315
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,969
So to speak.

316
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:25,169
Anyway, there's no sign of
a struggle or forced entry.

317
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,449
Estimated time of death between
6 and 8pm yesterday evening.

318
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:31,329
Have we got a cause of death yet
for Charlie Finleyson?

319
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:33,289
It's hard,
with the condition of the body.

320
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:40,489
I wanted to check his diary.

321
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:46,249
I went in there to find it and
he was...just lying on the floor!

322
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:53,089
I didn't touch anything. I just came
in here and called the police.

323
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:55,809
Who are the...other
regular staff here?

324
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:58,129
It's just me and Guy.

325
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:01,169
And Gemma helps out in the office
three days a week.

326
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,209
All the other contributors
are freelance.

327
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,009
I'm actually an artist.
I know. You do the illustrations

328
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,049
for the Nature Diary, don't you?
They're excellent. Oh, thank you.

329
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,849
My brother Garth writes the column.

330
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,809
Well, I'm very sorry
about what's happened here.

331
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:19,249
Do you have any idea at all...
who could have done this?

332
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,849
Guy wasn't everyone's favourite,
but I can't imagine anybody

333
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:25,729
actually wanting to murder him!

334
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:31,329
We need to know where you both were
yesterday evening
between six and eight.

335
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,329
I was driving back from Causton.

336
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:38,329
I had a meeting there with the
printers. Got back about half six.

337
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:43,169
I didn't bother coming into the
office. Guy had said he'd lock up.

338
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:47,169
He was working late. I spent
the rest of the evening at home.

339
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,409
Can anyone corroborate that?

340
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,889
I'm afraid not.

341
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:12,649
I was at The Morecroft bar
from six to seven.

342
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,609
I was meeting Garth. We often go
there for a drink before we go home.

343
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,849
We share a cottage.

344
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:23,809
Anyway, we must have left
about seven, quarter past...

345
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,129
There was that package.
The hand-delivered one.

346
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:40,209
Um, it was a brown envelope.
Big capital letters.

347
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:42,329
Addressed to Guy.

348
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:45,249
I don't know if that had anything
to do with what happened.

349
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:48,649
I put it on his desk.
Who was it from?

350
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:51,969
No idea.
He hadn't opened it by lunchtime.

351
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:54,969
He probably took it with him.
He often did.

352
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:59,409
Erm...
 There's something else I feel I should mention.

353
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:04,689
My brother spoke with Matt Morecroft
that evening.

354
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:08,329
Guy had asked him
to pass on a message

355
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:12,329
about how
The Morecroft wasn't allowed to
advertise in Midsomer Life any more

356
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,569
and I have to say

357
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:17,569
that Matt didn't look very pleased
about it when he left the hotel,

358
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:20,329
which was pretty much straight away.

359
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:24,089
Yeah. Come on, when you're ready!

360
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,289
Come on, come on!

361
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:48,889
Babe, there's something wrapped
round the front!

362
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:55,169
Oh, the tyre!

363
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:00,129
You're going to pay for this.
Or someone is.

364
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:02,249
Excuse me a second.

365
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,729
Hi.
Where are you going now?!

366
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:08,489
"It's Guy. He's dead."
When did it happen?

367
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:11,329
"They're saying between six and
eight yesterday evening."

368
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,809
They want to look over Guy's house.
Julia's taking them up there.

369
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,849
"Sorry, Garth."

370
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:21,929
Bye.

371
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,169
Er, we need the wire-cutters,
when you've finished communing
with nature

372
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:58,049
Miss Benson...

373
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:03,529
Miss Benson, was Guy Sandys involved
in any romantic relationships at all?

374
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:07,369
Yes, he was.

375
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,289
With me.

376
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:13,209
With you?

377
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:15,769
It started
after I began working for him.

378
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:17,689
When...when I moved here.

379
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:21,929
It was...it was a magical time.

380
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:26,849
Was it serious?

381
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:30,769
I couldn't answer for Guy.
I suppose not very, probably.

382
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,209
Guy wasn't a big romantic.

383
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:38,329
We didn't live together. I just came
over here a few nights a week.

384
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:40,689
We didn't make a big thing of it,
publicise it.

385
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,489
Sir, there's a telephone number for
a Mr Tomlin here.

386
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:49,609
Does that name mean anything to you?

387
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:56,289
It's a local number.
Try it, will you?

388
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,929
That can't have been
very easy for you.

389
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,249
He was still hurting
from the divorce.

390
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:07,449
She left him. People take time
to trust again, don't they?

391
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:11,769
It's the Morecroft Hotel.

392
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,209
Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

393
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:35,329
Guy's lover. No alibi.
Has to be on our list.

394
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:40,449
Julia!

395
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:43,409
Are you all right?

396
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,649
Oh, you poor thing.
You were so close.

397
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:50,569
Stop it!

398
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:53,809
I'll be fine. You can go.
I can manage. Please.

399
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:56,649
If that's what you want.
I'm sorry.

400
00:40:56,649 --> 00:41:00,849
It's just I've got to sort out the
magazine and make phone calls on top
of Guy's death.

401
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,769
Oh, you poor love...

402
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:12,009
We'd like to talk to you, sir, about
your relationship with Guy Sandys.
Excuse me!

403
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:14,289
Excuse me!
It was fairly straightforward.

404
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:17,729
I disliked him intensely.
He was arrogant and vindictive.

405
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:19,889
I just wanted to say -
That's enough.

406
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:25,769
I just wanted to say, Inspector,
that I knocked on the doors of
Midsomer Life offices last night.

407
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:28,329
It was about...oh...10:30, I think,

408
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:30,729
and the lights were on,
but there was no reply.

409
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:33,849
And your point is?

410
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:37,449
Well, obviously he was lying
there dead, wasn't he, of course?

411
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:39,929
Well, I'm sure that if the officers
want to talk to you

412
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:43,529
about your invaluable evidence,
they'll do so when they're ready.

413
00:41:43,529 --> 00:41:45,329
We'll talk later.
Thanks.

414
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:48,049
I'm sorry about that.

415
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:51,009
My mother made it a condition
of me taking over the hotel

416
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,289
that I keep Eleanor on.
It's misplaced loyalty.

417
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:57,049
The woman's a hopeless alcoholic.

418
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:02,409
We understand you left the hotel
at 6pm yesterday after
a conversation with Garth Platt.

419
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:07,129
Where did you go? I went to see
Guy Sandys at his office,

420
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:09,249
about the advertising
for the magazine.

421
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:13,209
But he told me I had to make
an appointment -
he had someone with him.

422
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,849
Who did he have with him?
Well...I didn't see them.

423
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:18,449
Whoever it was, was...
was in the office.

424
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:24,209
Look, I...I just went there
to sort out this review thing.

425
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,129
Which you were angry about.

426
00:42:26,529 --> 00:42:29,169
Actually, he was more angry
than I was when I got there,

427
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:31,729
if you really want to know.
Oh, really? What about?

428
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:36,329
I don't know. He had a brown
envelope in his hand

429
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,249
and he was cursing.

430
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,169
Mr Morecroft, does the name "Tomlin"
mean anything to you?

431
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:48,089
There's a gentleman staying in the
hotel by that name, if that's what
you mean.

432
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:51,329
His key's not here. Could you ring
through to his room, please?

433
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:53,529
Yes, of course.

434
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,209
He's a suspect, is he? Pretty much
everyone is a suspect at the moment.

435
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:01,449
You know, he spends a lot of time
sitting in his car outside.
Very odd.

436
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,009
He could be watching Midsomer Life
offices from there, you know.
When was this?

437
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:10,369
And then there's that mysterious
woman who kept phoning him. Mrs...

438
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:15,289
..Wilson.

439
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:20,169
Mr Tomlin hasn't picked up his
message. Now, there's a thing!

440
00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:24,289
No, I...I don't think I should.
Just give it to him!

441
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,529
"Mrs Wilson returned your call."

442
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:40,129
Is that it?
She didn't leave a number.

443
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:44,809
She said he knew it.
Of course, I dialled 1471.

444
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,129
It was "number withheld".

445
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:53,729
I'll need to see his room, please.

446
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:16,649
But he's booked in to stay
another couple of nights.

447
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,369
Paid in advance.

448
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:24,529
Has his car gone?
Well, it's not outside where
it usually is. I notice.

449
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:31,649
And no, it's not in the car park,
either. Red hatchback.

450
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:37,049
Christina!

451
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:40,689
There you are.
I'll be back after lunch.

452
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:44,369
My husband would still be alive,
if it wasn't for you.

453
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:48,169
If you hadn't insisted
on all this secrecy!

454
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:52,449
Charlie thought I was seeing someone
when I was coming here

455
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:55,529
and he died believing I was being
unfaithful to him,

456
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,449
and it's all your fault!

457
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:01,129
Well, I'm...I'm sorry.
I...I didn't -

458
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:05,209
God! Not content with ruining
your own sad little life,

459
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:07,689
you have to go and
ruin everyone else's, as well.

460
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:10,129
And for what?

461
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:14,249
All because you didn't want anyone
to know how much money you'd lost

462
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:19,009
in the biggest harebrained
"my perfect little dream restaurant"
scheme of all time

463
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:25,289
"Chez Martin" - home of
the pork-and-pineapple profiterole!

464
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:35,449
Actually, a lot of people
were quite complimentary about
my pork-and-pineapple profiteroles.

465
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:37,329
Oh, shut up!

466
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:42,609
Please help yourself
to anything you need.

467
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:48,009
The signing-in book is usually...

468
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:49,889
Well, it's usually right here.

469
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,049
Could you put that on my desk,
please? Thank you.

470
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:58,889
Seems our Mr Tomlin has just
been released from prison.

471
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,569
14 years for murder.
Murder?

472
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:10,289
Do you think you could keep it
to yourself, for the time being?

473
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:12,409
Could you do that?
If you wouldn't mind.

474
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:15,329
Yes. I did tell you he was
suspicious though, didn't I? My God!

475
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:17,729
I did say that. I knew it.
I knew he was weird.

476
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:21,009
- Sorry about that, sir.
- Yes

477
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:25,449
Do you think someone was paying him
to do their dirty work?

478
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,329
I have no idea, but I'd like to know
more about this Mrs Wilson.

479
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:31,689
There must be thousands of them out
there! Well, yes, I know. I know.

480
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,929
Get his address
from the signing-in book.

481
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:37,169
Get hold of the Chief Investigating
Officer on the Tomlin case,

482
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,329
see what he can tell us about him.
Murder?!

483
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:47,249
A well-oiled receptionist.

484
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:50,729
The rooms themselves overwhelmed

485
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:55,009
the odour of cheap toiletries
and other less savoury things.

486
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:58,649
For some hours after leaving
the establishment,

487
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,529
I felt a little soiled.

488
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:05,009
He wasn't too bothered keeping
the advertisers sweet or making
a profit.

489
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:08,969
He was worth a lot of money
after his time in the City.
Er, I can't find the diary.

490
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:11,209
If it's not here, I've no idea
where it would be.

491
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:15,609
No sign of the envelope, either.
Do you think someone took it?

492
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,609
It's possible.
Do you have any idea who he might
have been seeing yesterday evening?

493
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:21,849
He didn't mention anyone.

494
00:47:25,129 --> 00:47:27,969
I spotted him as being a bit odd
straight away. Didn't I?

495
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:30,729
Excuse me. I said he was weird.

496
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:34,049
Did you?
You know I did!

497
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,489
Right, I need to establish where you
both were

498
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:44,409
between 6 and 8pm yesterday evening.

499
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:47,849
I think Eleanor was here at the bar.

500
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:51,329
I think you were here for all that
time, weren't you? Yes. Drinking.

501
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:53,969
Up until after ten, I think it was.

502
00:47:54,969 --> 00:48:00,129
And you were here behind the bar?
I was here from shortly before six
till quarter to eleven.

503
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:03,569
Well, apart from the time you said
you went down to the cellar,

504
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,769
which was what, about...ten minutes?

505
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:11,089
And when would that have been?
I don't know.

506
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,809
Half past seven to eight.
More like five minutes.

507
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:20,809
- Who else was here at the time?
- Just the two of us.

508
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:23,409
Yes. Actually,
now I come to think of it,

509
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:28,009
ten minutes is more than enough time
for you to get down to the Midsomer
Life offices and back.

510
00:48:28,009 --> 00:48:31,569
I mean, I'm just saying.
And I suppose, come to think of it,

511
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:35,769
you probably have as good a motive
as anyone,

512
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:39,729
after that shocking review that Guy
gave you about your old restaurant.

513
00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:41,729
Absolute stinker!
But isn't that right?

514
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:44,569
If there was no-one else here,

515
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:46,689
then there's no-one
who can corroborate

516
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:48,849
you being here for those ten minutes
either!

517
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:51,209
YOU could have nipped up the road
and back again!

518
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:54,689
And with the forthcoming review of
the hotel, you'd have a motive, too,

519
00:48:54,689 --> 00:48:56,969
being a founding employee,

520
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:00,169
what with his references
to drunken staff!

521
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:02,489
Now, I wonder who that was
referring to

522
00:49:06,649 --> 00:49:09,209
Who do YOU think it was
he was meeting?

523
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:14,769
We only have Matt Morecroft's word
for it that he was meeting someone.

524
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:18,129
He could've been lying. There might
not have been anyone at all.

525
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,849
Have you seen the badgers?
Pardon?

526
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:26,969
Oh!

527
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:30,649
She is so talented, that girl!

528
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:36,729
You do like her work, don't you?
Oh, I do, yes. It's excellent.

529
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:41,929
What?
Nothing.

530
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:47,529
What about Martin Reid?
What about Martin Reid?

531
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:50,489
Well, it wasn't just
the restaurant that he lost

532
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:52,689
as a result of Guy's review.

533
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,089
Everyone knows
his wife left him
when it went bust.

534
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,769
He has motive.
Possibly, yeah.

535
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:00,969
I know a girl
who worked
at that restaurant.

536
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,729
I could ask her
about it. Joyce...

537
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:06,569
Joyce, we've just discovered

538
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:09,529
there was a convicted murderer
staying at the Morecroft Hotel,

539
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:13,369
possibly a contract killer. Now,
I don't want you getting involved.

540
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:15,289
Oh, Tom!

541
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:19,049
I love it
when you come over all protective.

542
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:23,569
Say it again.
Ooh, come here, you!

543
00:50:34,452 --> 00:50:37,852
Oh, I talked to Julia's
previous editor on the red top
she worked for.

544
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:42,292
Seems her leaving London was more
"voluntary redundancy"

545
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,732
than any burning desire
to live in the country.

546
00:50:51,812 --> 00:50:53,692
And she is the love interest.

547
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,132
Good actress or genuinely grieving?

548
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:02,332
Hello. Forgive the attire.

549
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:04,292
It's a...it's a late start.

550
00:51:05,012 --> 00:51:07,252
Well, would you like to come in?
Thank you.

551
00:51:07,252 --> 00:51:09,172
After you.

552
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:16,292
Can we sit down?
Oh, please.

553
00:51:20,772 --> 00:51:24,292
So is the mysterious Mr Tomlin
your chief suspect?

554
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:28,532
Oh, yes, one of them. Professional
hit man does seem a bit extreme,

555
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:31,172
but then, I suppose, they do exist?

556
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:34,732
Using his real name
doesn't seem like the most...
professional of tactics.

557
00:51:34,732 --> 00:51:38,052
But we're not ruling him out.
Have you spoken to Julia Benson?

558
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:44,972
Are you aware she was copulating
with Guy on a regular basis?

559
00:51:48,012 --> 00:51:50,772
Well, thank you very much for sharing
that information

560
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:53,412
and er...good morning to you,
Mrs Finleyson.

561
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:56,772
She's desperate to get her hands
on his money.

562
00:51:56,772 --> 00:51:58,692
Can't wait to get him up the aisle.

563
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:02,212
If I were you, I would have her
on the top of your list.

564
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:06,692
Excuse me, but how would killing Guy
BEFORE they were married,

565
00:52:06,692 --> 00:52:08,612
how would that help?

566
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:12,412
Well, I just wouldn't trust her
an inch.

567
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:14,692
When did you last see Guy?

568
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:20,412
I suppose it was about...
half past four on the afternoon...

569
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:23,132
of the day he died, since you ask.

570
00:52:25,652 --> 00:52:29,412
Yes, I'd gone
over there to ask him if he knew wha
Charlie had been doing there.

571
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:33,372
He denied knowing anything about it,
so I came home...and that was it.

572
00:52:44,212 --> 00:52:46,652
Ah! The intrepid off-roaders.

573
00:52:47,652 --> 00:52:50,892
Tell you what: if you want your
vehicles cleaned before you go,

574
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:53,292
I've got a little brother
who'll do it for a quid.

575
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:56,132
No, you're all right, thanks, mate.
Yeah, course.

576
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,572
I was forgetting.
You lot like to keep the mud on

577
00:52:58,572 --> 00:53:01,452
for when you visit
your supermarkets in Wimbledon

578
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:04,772
Hey, tell you what,
I've got some stickers.

579
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:08,772
"Genuine mud from the country". Put
one on the back there, if you like.
You what?

580
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:10,772
Ah, leave it, Brad.

581
00:53:11,532 --> 00:53:15,372
You'd think with all
the income we bring to the area,
they'd be grateful.

582
00:53:17,252 --> 00:53:19,852
So how do you feel about Guy's
review of your restaurant?

583
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,412
He did me a favour, to be honest.

584
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:25,932
I'm just not restaurant material.

585
00:53:26,892 --> 00:53:30,212
No, if Guy hadn't spelt it out, I'd
have probably struggled on for years

586
00:53:30,212 --> 00:53:33,492
before I came to terms with it. Come
on. There's more to it than that.

587
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:38,252
The bank foreclosed on you
very quickly, after that review
came out.

588
00:53:38,252 --> 00:53:41,772
You couldn't have staggered on
for a week, could you?

589
00:53:41,772 --> 00:53:45,252
And then you begged your sister
to keep quiet about the situation.

590
00:53:45,252 --> 00:53:47,172
It obviously hurt you.

591
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:50,572
And then, on top of all that,
your wife ups and leaves you.

592
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,132
Who told you that?
Oh, come on, Martin.

593
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:58,572
It's common knowledge. Well,
we'd grown apart by then, anyway.

594
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,092
Where's that coffee?

595
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:23,412
We particularly liked the
illustration of the young badgers.

596
00:54:23,412 --> 00:54:26,332
Oh. I don't know
if you have anything similar...

597
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:29,212
It's for my husband's birthday.

598
00:54:31,612 --> 00:54:33,492
Oh, that's the very one!

599
00:54:34,052 --> 00:54:37,212
I could frame it for you by tomorrow
morning, if you're interested.

600
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:39,132
Brilliant! Oh, job done!

601
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:43,892
Actually, best to make it tomorrow
afternoon. We're a bit pushed
at work at the moment,

602
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:48,932
what with...recent events.
I was so sorry to hear about Guy.

603
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:52,812
And we'll all miss his reviews.

604
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:56,132
Perhaps not everyone.

605
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:58,652
Oh... Really?

606
00:55:18,812 --> 00:55:21,212
There's a fair bit of suppressed
anger there!

607
00:55:21,212 --> 00:55:23,252
Yes.
It doesn't make him the murderer.

608
00:55:26,212 --> 00:55:29,412
And the sister's a bit pent-up,
as well. Yes, isn't she just!

609
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:37,612
Is there any chance she could've
thought Guy was responsible

610
00:55:37,612 --> 00:55:40,452
for her husband Charlie's death?
What, killed him in revenge?

611
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:42,772
No alibi.
That's right.

612
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:50,252
Do you know
where I could get some charcoal?
You'll be lucky to find any now.

613
00:55:50,252 --> 00:55:53,732
It's the end of the season, see.
And after this hot weekend
we've just had...

614
00:55:53,732 --> 00:55:56,852
And that's five. Thanks. Sorry about
that. Thanks, anyway. OK, bye.

615
00:56:01,132 --> 00:56:03,092
Oh, look. There's Joyce.

616
00:56:08,972 --> 00:56:10,852
Joyce!

617
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:17,332
I just ran into Gemma Platt,
our artist.

618
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:22,692
She says that Matt Morecroft tried
to bribe Julia Benson

619
00:56:22,692 --> 00:56:25,652
not to run Guy's review.
She's the editor.

620
00:56:25,652 --> 00:56:30,172
Yes, I know she's the editor.
Didn't I ask you -
Oh, do stop fussing, Tom.

621
00:56:30,172 --> 00:56:35,252
I'm not fussing.
Well, I can't help hearing things
if people insist on telling me.

622
00:56:36,012 --> 00:56:38,372
Well, I thought you'd be pleased.
I am pleased.

623
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:40,292
Oh. I'll see you later.

624
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:44,012
Hello, Ben!
Morning, Mrs Barnaby.

625
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,412
Mrs Barnaby has just told me

626
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:58,692
that Morecroft had tried to bribe
Julia to pull that hotel review.

627
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:02,132
How did she find that out?
Oh, she has her sources.

628
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:06,492
They obviously don't think
that Tomlin's the murderer,

629
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:08,732
despite what some local "experts"
think.

630
00:57:08,732 --> 00:57:10,812
They're considering
all possibilities.

631
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:13,132
Doesn't mean
he's not their chief suspect.

632
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:16,772
Why else would he do a runner?
They seemed to think
a professional hit man

633
00:57:16,772 --> 00:57:20,052
- might not use his real name.
- Might just have a point

634
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:27,772
Oh, pot holes!
They should get them fixed.

635
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:37,372
Of course, it is only
the opinion of policemen

636
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:39,972
with many years' experience
catching criminals

637
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:42,972
Well, if they are looking
for someone else,

638
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:46,892
I might just be able to point them
in the right direction.
Why doesn't that surprise me?

639
00:57:46,892 --> 00:57:50,372
If you keep your eyes open,
you can see things. Oh, yes!

640
00:57:52,892 --> 00:57:54,812
Gin and tonic, please.

641
00:57:57,092 --> 00:58:00,612
I don't think Matt Morecroft
would murder someone
for a bad hotel review.

642
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:05,092
And even if he did, why would he
then draw attention to himself

643
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:07,292
by trying to bribe them
not to run it?

644
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,572
I wonder where she's off to.

645
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:19,532
Thank you.

646
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,012
Look, I'm sorry
about what I said yesterday.

647
00:58:23,012 --> 00:58:24,932
It's not your fault.

648
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,612
Well, I'm...I'm sorry for what -

649
00:58:27,612 --> 00:58:30,092
Stop apologising. I said it's not
your fault. That's it.

650
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:32,852
I shouldn't have said what I said.

651
00:58:33,652 --> 00:58:35,932
Oh. Thank you.

652
00:58:37,732 --> 00:58:39,972
I still think
you shouldn't be working here.

653
00:58:39,972 --> 00:58:42,812
I mean, especially
for that jumped-up little...

654
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:45,172
Look, you're better than this,
Martin.

655
00:58:45,172 --> 00:58:47,932
You could have any job,
if you just gave it time.

656
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:49,812
Oh! Huh!

657
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:52,812
I'm sorry,
did you just say something?

658
00:58:53,332 --> 00:58:57,172
Eleanor here thinks
she knows who the murderer is.

659
00:59:00,132 --> 00:59:02,052
Really

660
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:06,972
Sorry, what's that on your lip?
Oh, er...

661
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:10,572
No, that's not what I said.

662
00:59:10,572 --> 00:59:14,972
Actually, the police will be
particularly interested
in what I have to tell them.

663
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:17,892
It's hard evidence...
about what I saw in the car park.

664
00:59:19,012 --> 00:59:20,892
I mean, WHO I saw in the car park.

665
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,932
And it's no good making faces.

666
00:59:23,932 --> 00:59:26,452
Some of the locals have a strange
sense of humour.

667
00:59:26,452 --> 00:59:30,012
Don't take offence. And don't worry
about the barbed-wire damage.

668
00:59:30,012 --> 00:59:32,692
We'll sort that out.

669
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:35,692
Martin, my man, I want you to give
these guests drinks on the house,

670
00:59:35,692 --> 00:59:37,812
whatever they want.

671
00:59:50,732 --> 00:59:52,732
Ms Benson?

672
00:59:52,732 --> 00:59:54,652
Ms Benson!

673
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:58,052
I've just heard that er...Matt
Morecroft was trying to..

674
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:01,052
- How shall I put this? -
persuade you to pull Guy's review.

675
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,732
He's going to be disappointed.

676
01:00:04,732 --> 01:00:08,012
It'd be a travesty to suppress
any review in Guy's memorial issue.

677
01:00:08,012 --> 01:00:11,972
You off to tell him, are you?
No, I'm...meeting Garth,

678
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:14,852
to ask him to write a piece
about Guy.

679
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:21,892
If you'd just excuse me.

680
01:00:22,732 --> 01:00:24,692
I assure you, I'm totally serious.

681
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:27,052
And what exactly did you see?

682
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:31,332
Well, I think I'll save that
for the police, if you don't mind.

683
01:00:31,332 --> 01:00:35,332
You're quite the detective
Eleanor, have you finished
the towels and the laundry?

684
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:38,372
Ooh... Perhaps you should finish
that before you have another glass.

685
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:51,532
Sorry about that.
Don't worry. She lives on another
planet, your receptionist.

686
01:00:51,532 --> 01:00:53,972
Has done for years.
Mr Morecroft...

687
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:58,652
Er, Mr Barnaby!
Is it still all right to use
the side rooms for the interviews?

688
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:00,732
Be my guest.
Thank you.

689
01:01:00,732 --> 01:01:03,772
Garth, could we have a word, please?

690
01:01:03,772 --> 01:01:05,692
Sir!

691
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:09,492
A minute.

692
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:15,332
They found Tomlin's car in London
- it's a hire car -

693
01:01:15,332 --> 01:01:17,892
parked near Waterloo station.

694
01:01:17,892 --> 01:01:21,292
They're suggesting
he might have caught the Eurostar an
left the country.

695
01:01:23,052 --> 01:01:24,972
Garth...

696
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:27,692
Guy came up to the off-road centre.

697
01:01:28,332 --> 01:01:31,252
I told him Matt wasn't there
and he gave me the message.

698
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:34,412
Tore up the contract in front
of everyone. "Everyone"?

699
01:01:34,412 --> 01:01:38,092
Yeah, the clients. The...City boys.

700
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:41,692
That Brad bloke
was trying to cause trouble.

701
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:44,212
I think he worked at Guy's firm -
they knew each other.

702
01:01:44,212 --> 01:01:47,892
What sort of trouble?
Stupid stuff about old school ties.

703
01:01:49,212 --> 01:01:51,052
He was being an idiot, you know.
Chippy.

704
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:36,652
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?

705
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,692
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby
from Causton CID

706
01:02:39,692 --> 01:02:42,092
and this is Detective Sergeant Jones.

707
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,452
We understand that you knew
Mr Guy Sandys. Is that right?

708
01:02:46,852 --> 01:02:50,612
A bit. Not that well.
Enough to have a row with him
at the off-road centre.

709
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:54,772
Well, don't you go anywhere, sir.

710
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:59,732
Need to have a little chat with you
after we've had a word
with Mr Morecroft here. Please.

711
01:03:07,052 --> 01:03:10,772
Guy Sandys was campaigning to have
the off-road centre closed down,
wasn't he?

712
01:03:10,772 --> 01:03:12,772
Was he?
Did you argue about that, too?

713
01:03:12,772 --> 01:03:14,812
I told you.
He was seeing someone else.

714
01:03:16,052 --> 01:03:18,332
There's no-one
who can corroborate that.

715
01:03:18,692 --> 01:03:21,052
I told Eleanor when I came back.

716
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:25,332
Eleanor Crouch?

717
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:29,252
She should remember.

718
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:31,492
She'd better bloody well remember,

719
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:34,292
because I definitely told her
he was with someone else -

720
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:39,172
Excuse me... I was wondering if you
knew how much longer it was going to
be. I do have to be somewhere.

721
01:03:39,172 --> 01:03:41,812
We'll be with you, sir,
as soon as we can. Thank you.

722
01:03:53,492 --> 01:03:55,412
For God's sake!
She's back in the bar.

723
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,140
Whoa...

724
01:05:15,155 --> 01:05:18,755
If I could have
your attention, please.

725
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:20,515
Thank you.

726
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,972
Now, we need to establish where
everyone was

727
01:05:24,972 --> 01:05:27,452
between the time Eleanor Crouch left
the bar

728
01:05:27,452 --> 01:05:29,972
and the time that we found her,

729
01:05:30,852 --> 01:05:33,132
and that means we need
to take statements.

730
01:05:33,132 --> 01:05:35,252
It's gonna take hours!

731
01:05:36,372 --> 01:05:38,572
Statements from each
and every one of you.

732
01:05:38,892 --> 01:05:41,892
Yeah, well, you are going
to see us first? We are busy people.

733
01:05:41,892 --> 01:05:45,452
And our time isn't worth anything?

734
01:05:45,452 --> 01:05:48,852
Can I point out that Eleanor Crouch
has been murdered

735
01:05:48,852 --> 01:05:51,932
and I'm sure that you are all
very anxious

736
01:05:51,932 --> 01:05:55,212
that we should find the person
or persons responsible.

737
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:57,012
Can I just ask you, please,
to be patient.

738
01:07:05,412 --> 01:07:07,172
Excuse me a moment.

739
01:07:07,172 --> 01:07:11,572
Sir, I was just talking
to Martin Reid.

740
01:07:12,572 --> 01:07:17,132
Eleanor told him how she'd seen
someone in the car park the evening
Guy Sandys was killed.

741
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:19,452
She didn't say who it was,

742
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,532
but she was telling him how the
police would be very interested.

743
01:07:22,532 --> 01:07:24,852
Fax came through for you at the
station, sir. Oh.

744
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:31,972
So the suggestion is that Eleanor
Crouch was killed

745
01:07:31,972 --> 01:07:35,012
to stop her telling
us who she saw in the car park?

746
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:38,372
How much longer?

747
01:07:38,852 --> 01:07:42,572
- Why don't you shut up?
- Yeah! Right!

748
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:44,492
Sit down, please, sir.
Try and be patient.

749
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:51,652
It's from the investigating officer
on the Tomlin case.

750
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:55,292
He says he'd be surprised if Tomlin
were a professional killer.

751
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:59,492
The murder he was convicted of
was a sexually-motivated crime.

752
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,692
"He was previously a highly-respected
member of the community."

753
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:04,652
Tomlin was a teacher!

754
01:08:04,652 --> 01:08:07,892
"He doesn't fit the profile
of any professional criminal."

755
01:08:12,932 --> 01:08:16,452
Well, people change inside,
especially after 14 years.

756
01:08:16,452 --> 01:08:18,372
Hm, yeah.

757
01:08:20,172 --> 01:08:24,012
Maybe Tomlin had his own,
you know, personal motive

758
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:25,932
for killing Guy Sandys.

759
01:08:26,212 --> 01:08:28,572
Did he kill Eleanor too?
Why would he do that?

760
01:08:29,812 --> 01:08:31,492
Whether or not he's the killer,

761
01:08:31,492 --> 01:08:34,372
Mr Tomlin is certainly
in the picture.

762
01:08:37,812 --> 01:08:40,412
And I bet he was your bleedin'
saboteur, an' all!

763
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:43,652
- Could you keep it down, please?
- Just pour the beers, Jeeves

764
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,532
He's been working for the bloke
who wanted to close you down.

765
01:08:46,532 --> 01:08:49,732
Of course it was him! He sabotaged
the course to give you more grief.

766
01:08:49,732 --> 01:08:51,612
He wouldn't do that. Would you?

767
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:54,052
Of course he would!

768
01:08:55,252 --> 01:08:58,172
You think I'd take your money
and then betray your trust?

769
01:08:58,172 --> 01:09:00,052
You think that's the sort of person
I am?

770
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:04,572
He's just a yokel killjoy who can't
stand people having more money and
more fun than him.

771
01:09:06,532 --> 01:09:09,612
If you were stupid enough to run your
course through a tip

772
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,812
and then divert a stream through it,

773
01:09:11,812 --> 01:09:14,572
don't be surprised if old bits of
rubbish start turning up!

774
01:09:14,572 --> 01:09:16,532
Well, thank you for that

775
01:09:16,812 --> 01:09:19,972
You're fired.

776
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,972
Yeah, well, Guy always warned me
what a prat you were!

777
01:09:26,012 --> 01:09:28,732
Would you throw this man out,
please? He's barred for life.

778
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,652
I think you can do that yourself.

779
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:35,772
And you can stick your miserable
job, along with your rude,
patronising attitude!

780
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:38,212
I'm out of here.

781
01:09:39,892 --> 01:09:41,932
Congratulations, Martin. Well done!

782
01:09:42,572 --> 01:09:44,812
Hang on. Who's going to serve us?

783
01:09:44,812 --> 01:09:48,012
I don't think the subject of who's
going to serve the metro tossers

784
01:09:48,012 --> 01:09:50,492
is on the top of anybody's
worry list right now

785
01:09:50,492 --> 01:09:52,612
Who are you calling "metro tosser",
mm?

786
01:09:53,892 --> 01:09:55,732
Hang on, Mandy. Take it easy.
Well?

787
01:09:56,532 --> 01:09:59,212
If the cap fits, darling, wear it.

788
01:10:19,972 --> 01:10:21,892
Stop it!

789
01:10:25,332 --> 01:10:27,612
That's enough! That's enough!

790
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,412
Stop it, stop it.

791
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,772
That's enough!

792
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:45,252
Well, if you will get involved
in pub brawls...

793
01:10:47,532 --> 01:10:49,452
Keep still.

794
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:53,172
I would've left it to uniform,
of course,

795
01:10:53,172 --> 01:10:56,692
but Jones was particularly keen
to protect a very pretty young WPC.

796
01:10:56,692 --> 01:10:58,692
Not that she needed much protection!

797
01:10:59,572 --> 01:11:02,092
She almost wrenched
the arm off one of the Londoners

798
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:04,252
when she was arresting him!

799
01:11:04,252 --> 01:11:06,932
He's gonna have his hands full
if he gets involved with her!

800
01:11:06,932 --> 01:11:08,772
Maybe he wants his hands full.

801
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:10,812
There, all better.

802
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,732
Thank you.

803
01:11:15,092 --> 01:11:18,212
The cells are full of rioting locals
and off-roaders.

804
01:11:20,052 --> 01:11:23,652
Still no nearer solving the murder.
Not one of your better days?

805
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:25,572
No. Oh, thank you.

806
01:11:26,772 --> 01:11:29,252
Have you got any suggestions?
Me? Yes, you.

807
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:32,212
Jones is always saying you do
all my detective work for me.

808
01:11:32,212 --> 01:11:35,292
Oh, no. I just help out with a
little local knowledge, when I can.

809
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,212
I...I was only joking.
Were you? Oh.

810
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:50,852
I was very interested
to get your call - and surprised.

811
01:11:51,772 --> 01:11:54,852
I'd thought we'd actually got
somewhere with Freddie Tomlin.

812
01:11:55,972 --> 01:11:59,132
It took him a long time coming to
terms with what he'd done

813
01:11:59,132 --> 01:12:01,612
- you know, admitting it -

814
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:05,852
but we were actually quite confident
about giving him parole.

815
01:12:05,852 --> 01:12:09,052
Did he...did he have much connection
with the outside world? Visitors?

816
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:13,652
The family virtually wrote him off
after the trial.

817
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:15,532
You know, complete cut-off.

818
01:12:15,852 --> 01:12:18,852
No, as far as I know, he didn't
receive a single visitor...

819
01:12:20,012 --> 01:12:24,172
Oh... Except a couple of months
before his release.

820
01:12:24,572 --> 01:12:26,492
Yeah, a Mrs Jane Wilson.

821
01:12:27,532 --> 01:12:29,452
Wilson?

822
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:44,092
Can I help you?
Mrs Wilson? Mrs Jane Wilson?

823
01:12:45,252 --> 01:12:48,812
Yes. I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Barnaby, from Causton CID.

824
01:12:49,692 --> 01:12:51,692
Er, can you spare me a few minutes?

825
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:56,092
I've been expecting you. Come in.

826
01:12:58,052 --> 01:12:59,972
Perfect!

827
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:04,572
I hope your husband likes it.
Oh, I know he will.

828
01:13:04,572 --> 01:13:08,812
No, my only problem now is to find
some charcoal for the barbecue.

829
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:11,732
Well, you know my brother
makes the stuff. Really?

830
01:13:12,412 --> 01:13:15,772
- He wouldn't have some to spare?
- Only about a couple of tons

831
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:35,332
Oh, er, Personnel Department, please.

832
01:14:09,052 --> 01:14:11,292
No, no, look.

833
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:13,772
This was 14,
15 years ago. Yeah.

834
01:14:15,012 --> 01:14:16,892
Thank you.

835
01:14:27,612 --> 01:14:31,412
'No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid
he doesn't appear to be answering.'

836
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:40,332
But he's booked in to stay another
couple of nights. Paid in advance!

837
01:14:40,932 --> 01:14:44,492
Has his car gone? It's not outside
where it usually is. I...I notice.

838
01:14:48,012 --> 01:14:50,452
And no, it's not in the car park,
either.

839
01:15:00,852 --> 01:15:04,852
I went to see Guy Sandys at his
office. I just went there to sort
out this review thing.

840
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:09,212
Actually, he was more angry
than I was when I got there,
if you really want to know.

841
01:15:10,692 --> 01:15:14,692
'He had a brown envelope in his hand
and he was cursing.'

842
01:15:15,092 --> 01:15:18,572
'I don't know if that had
anything to do with what happened.'

843
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:49,462
Mr Barnaby.
Miss Benson, may we talk?

844
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,822
Of course. Come in.
Thank you.

845
01:16:02,222 --> 01:16:04,702
I wonder
if you'd take a look at these.

846
01:16:16,942 --> 01:16:18,862
Trust...

847
01:16:19,502 --> 01:16:21,422
You said I could trust you.

848
01:16:23,382 --> 01:16:25,982
I remember the story,
but it's been a long time.

849
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:30,942
Mr Tomlin, who was staying
at the Morecroft Hotel

850
01:16:30,942 --> 01:16:33,022
and who was seen
watching these offices,

851
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:35,142
and who subsequently went missing,

852
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:39,222
is the man who was convicted
of the murder in this case.

853
01:16:40,222 --> 01:16:42,902
Really?
Really. And Mrs Wilson here,

854
01:16:42,902 --> 01:16:46,342
she is the sister of the chief
witness at the trial.

855
01:16:47,902 --> 01:16:52,102
That same chief witness
to whom the newspaper for which
you were working at the time

856
01:16:52,822 --> 01:16:56,142
paid a large, very large
amount of money for her story.

857
01:16:57,422 --> 01:17:00,662
Mrs Wilson, would you tell us
what happened

858
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:04,702
when you went to visit your
sister in hospital for the last time?

859
01:17:04,702 --> 01:17:08,262
Can I ask what -
Please, Julia, bear with us.

860
01:17:09,062 --> 01:17:10,982
It won't take long. I promise.

861
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:14,782
Mrs Wilson.

862
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:18,222
She was very sick
- she had terminal cancer -

863
01:17:19,862 --> 01:17:22,182
and she was desperate
to tell me something.

864
01:17:25,782 --> 01:17:28,742
'It was about the big murder case.
The trial of Frederick Tomlin.

865
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:32,502
She told me she wanted
to withdraw her evidence.

866
01:17:32,502 --> 01:17:35,302
How, shortly before
the case opened,

867
01:17:35,302 --> 01:17:37,782
she'd become
much less confident

868
01:17:37,782 --> 01:17:39,862
that she could
definitely
identify Tomlin

869
01:17:39,862 --> 01:17:41,502
as being the man
at the murder scene.'

870
01:17:41,502 --> 01:17:44,782
Thank you for coming.

871
01:17:46,182 --> 01:17:48,942
She said the people
at the newspaper told her

872
01:17:48,942 --> 01:17:51,462
that she couldn't withdraw
her evidence

873
01:17:51,462 --> 01:17:54,822
and if she did, then
she wouldn't be a witness

874
01:17:56,182 --> 01:17:59,742
and they'd have to take back the
money they'd paid her for the story.

875
01:18:00,782 --> 01:18:02,702
But she'd already spent it.

876
01:18:05,502 --> 01:18:09,022
'My sister made me promise to go and
see the man who had been convicted,

877
01:18:09,022 --> 01:18:11,822
Frederick Tomlin,
and tell him what had happened

878
01:18:11,822 --> 01:18:13,702
and ask him to forgive her.

879
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:16,462
Amazingly,
he said she had his forgiveness.'

880
01:18:17,502 --> 01:18:19,782
Unfortunately, my sister died

881
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:22,062
before I
had a chance to pass the message on.

882
01:18:25,182 --> 01:18:27,342
And her evidence died with her.

883
01:18:30,062 --> 01:18:32,022
14 years on,
Tomlin was due for parole.

884
01:18:33,102 --> 01:18:35,742
Mrs Wilson's story,
being hearsay evidence,

885
01:18:36,102 --> 01:18:38,382
wouldn't have been admissible anyway.

886
01:18:38,382 --> 01:18:41,142
Not in
a criminal court of appeal, that is.

887
01:18:41,942 --> 01:18:45,502
But it might have been
admissible in a civil court.

888
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:50,142
And Mrs Wilson here
did agree to give evidence,

889
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,782
if Tomlin decided to bring a civil
action against the journalist
involved.

890
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:57,262
And that journalist was you.

891
01:19:00,982 --> 01:19:02,822
Stephens?
Sir.

892
01:19:03,662 --> 01:19:07,022
Mrs Wilson, if you'd accompany this
officer back to the police station.

893
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:09,182
We'll be with you
shortly - and thank you.

894
01:19:10,462 --> 01:19:14,502
This way.

895
01:19:15,062 --> 01:19:17,502
There were a lot of us working
on the case at the time.

896
01:19:18,302 --> 01:19:20,862
I don't know who she spoke to,
but it certainly wasn't me.

897
01:19:21,262 --> 01:19:23,982
We believe that
Tomlin came here to expose you,

898
01:19:23,982 --> 01:19:27,142
to ruin your life as you had
certainly ruined his.

899
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:29,422
Because he was innocent, wasn't he?

900
01:19:29,422 --> 01:19:31,582
They all say they're innocent.

901
01:19:31,942 --> 01:19:33,942
Oh, right.

902
01:19:33,942 --> 01:19:36,582
But you didn't care if he was
innocent or not, did you?

903
01:19:36,582 --> 01:19:38,502
So long as you got your story.

904
01:19:39,022 --> 01:19:42,102
We think that Tomlin delivered
that envelope by hand.

905
01:19:43,222 --> 01:19:45,982
'It contained a dossier
for Guy's attention.

906
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:48,342
Articles that you'd
been responsible for,

907
01:19:48,342 --> 01:19:52,262
along with a copy of the signed
affidavit from Mrs Wilson

908
01:19:52,262 --> 01:19:54,902
detailing her sister's deathbed
confession.

909
01:19:55,942 --> 01:19:59,022
We know that Guy didn't open his mail
immediately.

910
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:02,302
But by the time he finally did,

911
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:06,022
Tomlin had already confronted you
about it and you had killed him.'

912
01:20:10,742 --> 01:20:12,662
No.

913
01:20:13,502 --> 01:20:16,462
Not me.
Yes, you, Julia.

914
01:20:19,662 --> 01:20:24,222
'Guy must have read the dossier. Did
he guess that you'd killed Tomlin?

915
01:20:26,862 --> 01:20:30,142
And what did he do? Did he threaten
you? Threaten to go to the police?

916
01:20:30,142 --> 01:20:34,742
Well, whatever it was, you decided
that he had to die, as well.'

917
01:20:49,742 --> 01:20:52,982
I really don't see how you can
fabricate this without any evidence.

918
01:20:52,982 --> 01:20:55,822
It seems very unprofessional.
You wanted people to believe

919
01:20:55,822 --> 01:21:00,062
that Tomlin had killed Guy
and done a runner, mm?

920
01:21:00,742 --> 01:21:04,342
'So you had to make it look as if
Tomlin had left the hotel of his
own accord.

921
01:21:04,342 --> 01:21:06,862
So you went to his room,
packed his bags...

922
01:21:08,222 --> 01:21:12,262
But you couldn't risk
being seen wandering around the hotel
with his baggage, could you?

923
01:21:13,422 --> 01:21:16,702
So you...
dropped it out of the window...'

924
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:23,982
'..and picked it up later on

925
01:21:24,742 --> 01:21:26,662
and put those bags in Tomlin's car.'

926
01:21:28,662 --> 01:21:32,022
We believe that you dumped those bags
on the way up to London,

927
01:21:32,022 --> 01:21:35,302
where you left the car
outside Waterloo station

928
01:21:35,302 --> 01:21:39,542
to make us believe that he had done
a runner to the Continent.

929
01:21:41,302 --> 01:21:43,542
It would have worked out
absolutely fine,

930
01:21:45,102 --> 01:21:48,782
if Eleanor Crouch had not seen you
in the car park.

931
01:21:50,582 --> 01:21:55,062
And Eleanor - miraculously -
remembered seeing you the next day

932
01:21:55,062 --> 01:21:58,622
and thought that's probably
a very important piece of evidence

933
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,542
that she should tell us about.

934
01:22:01,422 --> 01:22:03,302
So you decided to kill her too,

935
01:22:04,982 --> 01:22:07,142
before she could tell us
what she'd seen.

936
01:22:13,502 --> 01:22:15,742
No. Wrong again!

937
01:22:16,342 --> 01:22:19,502
We spoke to your previous editor,
who said he had to let you go

938
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,782
because you'd do anything
to get the story.

939
01:22:22,742 --> 01:22:24,702
Always have done, apparently.

940
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:28,462
So it wasn't love of the country
that brought you out here, was it?

941
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:30,582
You just didn't have
anywhere else to go.

942
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:36,102
And that's it, is it? A few
squashed flowers in a car park

943
01:22:37,422 --> 01:22:39,302
Any proper evidence at all?

944
01:22:40,902 --> 01:22:43,262
Perhaps you'd explain how I was
supposed to know

945
01:22:43,262 --> 01:22:46,542
Eleanor planned to tell you she'd
allegedly seen me in the car park,

946
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:49,422
when I wasn't even at the bar
when she was boring people with it?

947
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:51,382
I was with you and Sergeant Jones.

948
01:22:51,382 --> 01:22:53,462
I had no idea what she'd planned!

949
01:22:53,462 --> 01:22:55,382
Where is Frederick Tomlin's body?

950
01:22:56,462 --> 01:22:58,382
You'll never find a body,

951
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,742
because there is no body to find.

952
01:23:02,742 --> 01:23:05,622
He's alive and well and
congratulating himself

953
01:23:05,622 --> 01:23:08,262
on giving those sluggish
country coppers the slip!

954
01:23:08,262 --> 01:23:10,382
I know that you are the murderer.

955
01:23:10,662 --> 01:23:12,582
Arrest me, then!

956
01:23:28,902 --> 01:23:31,782
Three big motives
and not a shred of evidence!

957
01:23:31,782 --> 01:23:35,302
Doesn't look like she's going to be
bluffed into a confession, either.

958
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:39,302
No. What was all that about not
hearing what Eleanor said in the bar?

959
01:23:39,302 --> 01:23:43,182
I mean, she knew she'd been seen in
the car park by Eleanor

960
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:45,302
because she was there.
Simple as that.

961
01:23:46,462 --> 01:23:49,182
Mind you, there was an air
of desperation about it all.

962
01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:53,302
Why kill her at the hotel? Why at
that time, with so many people about?

963
01:23:53,302 --> 01:23:55,462
It's very risky, isn't it?

964
01:23:55,462 --> 01:23:58,662
Maybe she had only just heard
what Eleanor intended to do.

965
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,022
Could someone
have mentioned it to her?

966
01:24:04,102 --> 01:24:08,622
No, I'm...meeting Garth to ask him
to write a piece about Guy.

967
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,542
'Garth and Julia.'

968
01:24:17,462 --> 01:24:20,022
Garth and Julia. What if they were
having an affair, eh?

969
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:22,342
Julia would've kept quiet about that.

970
01:24:22,342 --> 01:24:24,902
Wouldn't want to harm
her relationship with Guy.

971
01:24:25,622 --> 01:24:28,702
It was Garth who told her
what Eleanor said in the bar.

972
01:24:32,502 --> 01:24:35,742
Garth's working
over at Drover's Copse.

973
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:38,302
I thought you'd spoken to him
already.

974
01:24:38,302 --> 01:24:41,102
It's just a few points,
you know, we need to clear up.

975
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:44,862
Drover's Copse? Where's that?
It's the turning just after
the Malham road.

976
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:48,222
You go past Bonham's Farm.
Take a left after a couple
of hundred yards.

977
01:24:48,222 --> 01:24:50,262
Got that?
Yes, sir.

978
01:24:50,262 --> 01:24:53,502
Would I be right in thinking
that Garth has got a girlfriend?

979
01:24:54,902 --> 01:24:57,542
He won't tell ME,
but there is someone.

980
01:24:58,462 --> 01:25:00,902
There was lipstick on his ear
the other day.

981
01:25:00,902 --> 01:25:04,942
He got all shy when I pointed it
out.  Thank you.

982
01:25:33,582 --> 01:25:35,502
Hello? Anyone there?

983
01:25:43,102 --> 01:25:46,102
The turning's just up here, I think.

984
01:25:46,102 --> 01:25:47,982
You think?

985
01:25:57,542 --> 01:26:00,862
Hello? Hello!

986
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:11,742
- Ooh!
- Eco Friendly.

987
01:26:49,062 --> 01:26:50,982
You looked in the bag.

988
01:26:53,382 --> 01:26:55,662
You shouldn't have done that,
Mrs Barnaby.

989
01:27:07,702 --> 01:27:09,742
Right or left here?
It's right, I think.

990
01:27:10,382 --> 01:27:12,262
Oh, no! As you were, to the left.

991
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:15,462
Sorry.

992
01:27:24,342 --> 01:27:26,182
That's Joyce's car!
Is it? Yeah.

993
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,862
Joyce, what did I say to you?

994
01:27:53,662 --> 01:27:56,982
I just came up here
for some charcoal. Honestly.

995
01:27:57,902 --> 01:28:02,502
Do you realise who this man is?
We suspect he is an accomplice
to the murders.

996
01:28:03,902 --> 01:28:06,742
Well, not exactly an accomplice.

997
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:11,062
Apparently, Julia said she
killed Mr Tomlin in self-defence...

998
01:28:11,782 --> 01:28:14,742
and Garth only helped
with the disposal of the body.

999
01:28:16,622 --> 01:28:18,662
And Charlie Finleyson
was a heart attack.

1000
01:28:22,862 --> 01:28:24,782
We saw him watching.

1001
01:28:28,422 --> 01:28:32,782
'Guy was away. Julia suggested
that we use the pool.'

1002
01:28:45,582 --> 01:28:49,462
'Julia panicked. She mistakenly
thought the intruder was Tomlin...'

1003
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:51,262
Get him.
'..the murderer.

1004
01:28:57,382 --> 01:29:00,182
She'd already told me
that he was getting out of prison,

1005
01:29:00,182 --> 01:29:03,102
that he'd sworn revenge on her
for putting him inside.'

1006
01:29:05,782 --> 01:29:07,662
'I had no idea it was someone else.'

1007
01:29:11,102 --> 01:29:13,022
Hell!

1008
01:29:15,822 --> 01:29:17,742
'I chased him.'

1009
01:29:21,342 --> 01:29:23,422
'I didn't know he was going to die.'

1010
01:29:33,262 --> 01:29:35,182
'It was locked.

1011
01:29:44,502 --> 01:29:46,262
I didn't know what to do.'

1012
01:29:48,302 --> 01:29:51,302
I didn't kill him.
You stole his wallet. No!

1013
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:55,742
No, I just thought I'd better check
his ID. That's all it was. I swear!

1014
01:29:57,382 --> 01:30:01,302
And then, when Tomlin did turn up,
he was suddenly dead, as well.

1015
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:09,342
Julia said it was self-defence,

1016
01:30:09,342 --> 01:30:12,502
but that you lot wouldn't
believe her and we'd have
to get rid of the body.

1017
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:19,582
I didn't kill anyone.

1018
01:30:24,822 --> 01:30:26,702
I don't know how it all happened.

1019
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:30,302
It's a nightmare.

1020
01:30:32,502 --> 01:30:36,222
He says, when Guy was killed,
Julia denied any involvement.

1021
01:30:37,022 --> 01:30:39,182
And the same with Eleanor's death.

1022
01:30:39,182 --> 01:30:41,662
He suspected that she was behind
both of them,

1023
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:43,942
but by then he was in too deep
to say anything.

1024
01:30:45,462 --> 01:30:50,182
Yeah, I wanted to believe her,
you know, but...I knew.

1025
01:31:01,382 --> 01:31:03,302
So that's it?

1026
01:31:03,902 --> 01:31:08,382
Erm, Mr Tomlin's skull
and the rest of his charred remains

1027
01:31:08,382 --> 01:31:10,262
are in that bag, over there.

1028
01:31:30,822 --> 01:31:33,142
Really, I only came
for the charcoal.

1029
01:31:33,142 --> 01:31:35,062
It was a coincidence.

1030
01:31:42,822 --> 01:31:44,702
God knows what might have happened!

1031
01:31:45,742 --> 01:31:48,062
It doesn't bear thinking about,
does it?

1032
01:31:48,062 --> 01:31:52,942
OK, maybe he wasn't the murderer,
but given the emotional state
he was in, he could've done anything!

1033
01:31:52,942 --> 01:31:55,342
And he's no slouch with an axe,
from what I've heard.

1034
01:31:55,342 --> 01:31:57,262
Oh, thank you, George

1035
01:31:57,902 --> 01:32:00,702
Yeah, I...I was wondering
about the body disposal,

1036
01:32:00,702 --> 01:32:03,302
because the temperature
in those charcoal retorts

1037
01:32:03,302 --> 01:32:06,222
doesn't get high enough
to reduce a body totally to ash.

1038
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:09,342
Hence the sledgehammer to smash up
the bones and the teeth.

1039
01:32:09,342 --> 01:32:14,702
He was going to scatter the remains
all over the woodlands up there.
And he confessed all to Joyce? Yes.

1040
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:17,942
Handy, having a wife
to do all your hard work for you.

1041
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:20,422
It's the talk of the station, Tom.

1042
01:32:22,822 --> 01:32:25,862
And, talking of burning things
to a crisp,

1043
01:32:26,502 --> 01:32:28,862
I think your Cumberlands
need turning.

1044
