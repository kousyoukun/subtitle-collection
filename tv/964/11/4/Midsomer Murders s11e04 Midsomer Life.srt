<i>Previously on AMC's

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,966
Get out! Please!

3
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:06,889
We're going. Ain't nobody
got to get shot here.

4
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:07,991
Go!

5
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,985
How much longer do you need?

6
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,482
I don't know.

7
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:12,760
One time that
son of--

8
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,057
( walkers snarling )

9
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:33,452
- Rick: We're not leaving.
- Hershel: We can't stay here.

10
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:35,270
What if there's another sniper?

11
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,489
A wood pallet won't stop
one of those rounds.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,458
- Beth: We can't even go outside.
- Carol: Not in the daylight.

13
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:41,543
Rick says we're not
running, we're not running.

14
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:44,496
No, better to live like rats.

15
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:46,581
You got a better idea?

16
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:48,834
Yeah, we should have slid
out of here last night

17
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:50,719
<i>and lived to fight another day.</i>

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,338
<i>But we lost that
window, didn't we?</i>

19
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:56,341
I'm sure he's got scouts on every
road out of this place by now.

20
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:58,626
We ain't scared of that prick.

21
00:00:58,627 --> 00:01:00,562
Merle:
<i>Y'all should be.</i>

22
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:02,931
That truck through
the fence thing,

23
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:05,267
that's just him
ringing the doorbell.

24
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:08,153
We might have some thick
<i>walls to hide behind,</i>

25
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,772
<i>but he's got the guns</i>
<i>and the numbers.</i>

26
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:13,308
And if he takes the high ground
<i>around this place,</i>

27
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:17,779
shoot, he could just starve
us out if he wanted to.

28
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,332
Let's put him
in the other cell block.

29
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,367
No. He's got a point.

30
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:24,486
This is all you.
You started this.

31
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:26,988
What difference whose fault it is?
What do we do?

32
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,673
I said we should leave.

33
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:31,159
Now Axel's dead.

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,296
We can't just sit here.

35
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:38,300
( yells ) Get back here!

36
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:43,805
You're slipping, Rick.

37
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:46,475
We've all seen it.
We understand why.

38
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:48,510
But now is not the time.

39
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:51,279
You once said
this isn't a democracy.

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,782
Now you have to own up to that.

41
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:57,152
I put my family's life
in your hands.

42
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:59,488
So get your head clear

43
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,190
and do something.

44
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,459

<i>( door opens )</i>

47
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,556
You shouldn't be out here.

48
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:12,060
I'm a good shot.

49
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,062
Yes, you are.

50
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:20,268
Hey, Dad?

51
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:21,936
Yeah?

52
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:26,191
If I say something, will
you promise not to be mad?

53
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:29,143
I won't get mad.

54
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,148
You should stop.

55
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,034
Stop what?

56
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:38,986
Being the leader.

57
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,961
Let Hershel and Daryl
handle things.

58
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:50,331
You deserve a rest.

Governor: How many
does that give us now?

62
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:55,143
20. We have several people
with chronic conditions,

63
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:58,013
hearing impairments, arthritis.

64
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:02,601
Adding those gives us 26.

65
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,156
And if we include men
and women age 13 and up?

66
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:10,192
You mean boys and girls?

67
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:15,313
Adolescence-- it's a
20th century invention.

68
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,282
Men and women.

69
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:23,455
There're, uh, 35.

70
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:27,009
Well, make sure they all have
sidearms and plenty of ammo.

71
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,294
We'll start training
when Martinez is ready.

72
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,385
Well, come in.

73
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:39,554
What's this I hear
about the prison?

74
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,556
You said you were
gonna leave it alone.

75
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,025
No retaliation.

76
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,843
I went to negotiate.

77
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,845
Bad enough we got
biters at our gates.

78
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,197
We can't have aggressors
just miles away.

79
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,015
So you went and welcomed
them to the neighborhood?

80
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,901
You know they shot at us?

81
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:55,353
I don't know who these people
were when you were with them,

82
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,356
but they've changed.
They're bloodthirsty.

83
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,860
You knew about this?

84
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,863
I was informed this morning.

85
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,381
I didn't know.

86
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,166
Don't drag him into it.

87
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,219
You're right.
This is between you and me.

88
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,222
I'm sick of this.
Sick of the lies.

89
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:17,542
And I'm not gonna watch this town
and my friends gun each other down.

90
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,210
Well, it's too late.

91
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,929
What do you mean it's too late?

92
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,431
I don't know what
you're trying to prove,

93
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,932
but enough is enough.

94
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,884
I'm going to see them.

95
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,352
I'll work this out.

96
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,521
Well, they're hostile.

97
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,858
These are all the
able-bodied people we have.

98
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,910
They're gonna carry arms
and receive training.

99
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,895
We won't get caught
sleeping again.

100
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,564
One car, that is all I need.

101
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,285
The roads are blocked.

102
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:45,737
We barely made it
back ourselves.

103
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,044
Andrea.

104
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,914
You go to that prison,

105
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,100
you stay there.

106
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,376
Karen:
<i>Noah's only 14.</i>

107
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,628
Okay? He has asthma. He can't
run more than 10 yards

108
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,997
before losing his breath.
What good is that to you?

109
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:31,249
Martinez: The Governor wants
everyone who can hold a gun

110
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,419
- in front of the town hall now.
- No.

111
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,788
Andrea, you have to
straighten this out.

112
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,306
They want Noah to fight.

113
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,809
Who's talking about fighting?

114
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,628
You're supposed to be teaching
people to defend themselves,

115
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,514
not raising an army.

116
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:48,099
Wake up.

117
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,353
The only way to defend
ourselves is with an army.

118
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:56,140
Take watch.
Eyes open, head down.

119
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,362
Field's filled with walkers.

120
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,113
I didn't see any
snipers out there,

121
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,148
but we'll keep Maggie on watch.

122
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,368
I'll get up in the guard tower,

123
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,204
take out half them walkers, give these
guys a chance to fix the fence.

124
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,656
Or use some of the cars
to put the bus in place.

125
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,159
We can't access the field without
burning through our bullets.

126
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,380
So we're trapped in here.
There's barely any food or ammo.

127
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,498
Been here before.
We'll be all right.

128
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,884
That's when it was just us.

129
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,970
Before there was
a snake in the nest.

130
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,771
Man, we gonna go
through this again?

131
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,691
Look, Merle's staying here.
He's with us now.

132
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,843
- Get used to it.
- Hey.

133
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,845
All y'all.

134
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,535
Seriously, Rick, I don't think Merle
living here is really gonna fly.

135
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,520
I can't kick him out.

136
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,156
I wouldn't ask you to live with
Shane after he tried to kill you.

137
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,043
Merle has military experience.

138
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,161
He may be erratic,

139
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,998
but don't underestimate
his loyalty to his brother.

140
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,083
What if we solve both
problems at once?

141
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,702
Deliver Merle to the Governor.
Bargaining chip.

142
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,755
Give him his traitor,
maybe declare a truce.

143
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:15,720
You're the farmer, Hershel.

144
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,390
And you're the
black sheep, Merle.

145
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,529
How'd you lose it?

146
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,531
I was bit.

147
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,901
Bit?
You hack it off yourself?

148
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,736
No.

149
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,007
Rick did.

150
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,743
Awful kindly of him.

151
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,912
Saved my life.

152
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,466
Gave me more time
with my girls.

153
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,085
Gave you more time
with your brother.

154
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,421
Can't put a price on that.

155
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,642
Can't put a price
on anything anymore.

156
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,767
I found this

157
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,236
in one of the cells.

158
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,157
Lost more than the Good
Book there for a while.

159
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,327
Lost my way.

160
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,786
"And if your right hand
offends you,

161
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,973
cut it off, cast it from you.

162
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,976
For it is profitable

163
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,261
that one of your members
should perish--"

164
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,132
"And not that thy whole body
should be cast into hell."

165
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,803
Matthew 5:29 and 30.

166
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,947
Woodbury had
a damn fine library.

167
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,751
One of the only things
I miss about it.

168
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,341
When the Governor returns,

169
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,960
he's gonna kill me first.

170
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,714
Michonne, my brother,

171
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:08,383
then your girls.

172
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,334
Glenn, Carl, the baby,

173
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,187
whoever else is left.

174
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:14,338
He'll save Rick for last

175
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,842
so he can watch his family
and friends die ugly.

176
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,062
That's who you're dealing with.

177
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,685
This is Mrs. McLeod.

178
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,988
She's the one with arthritis.

179
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,028
Well, thank you, dear,

180
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,664
but we'll find another way
you can help us.

181
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,594
Noah's asthmatic.

182
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,100
You ever shoot a gun, son?

183
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:02,353
I had a BB gun once.
My mom took it away.

184
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,056
Well, you're gonna learn
from the best.

185
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,672
Haven't had a chance to say
I'm glad you came back.

186
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,176
To what?
All this?

187
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,247
This is our home.

188
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,385
This is a tomb.

189
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,257
That's what T-Dog
called it.

190
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,026
Thought he was right

191
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,262
till you found me.

192
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,243
He's your brother,
but he's not good for you.

193
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,278
Don't let him bring you down.

194
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,582
After all,
look how far you've come.

195
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,223
( both laugh )

196
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,607
We sealed it thoroughly.

197
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,277
Nobody's getting in or out.

198
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,499
I'm gonna ask you something

199
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,667
and I need you to be honest.

200
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,920
Okay.

201
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,088
The fight at the prison,

202
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,090
you swear you didn't know
anything about it?

203
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,376
I wouldn't advocate
a move like that.

204
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:50,494
It's just posturing.

205
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,882
Good. Then you have
to cover for me.

206
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,467
I'm going to the prison.

207
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,170
- And the Governor can't know.
- Don't.

208
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,472
I have to.
I was with them.

209
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,441
Don't put me in this situation.

210
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,560
- I wish there was another way.
- If he finds out--

211
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,978
That's a chance
we have to take.

212
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,112
Maybe you do, but I don't.

213
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,064
I'm sorry.
I can't.

214
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:12,233
Look at what's happened.

215
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:15,853
Woodbury is an armed camp
with child soldiers.

216
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,656
Cannon fodder in a war
over what?

217
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,408
Is that what
all your work is for?

218
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,577
Please, help me
get out of here.

219
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,630
I can't take a car.
They won't open the gates.

220
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,500
I just need to sneak out,
make my way to the prison,

221
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,586
- and talk to Rick.
- This is a betrayal.

222
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:36,341
No, it's an attempt to stop this
before more people get killed.

223
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,509
You can do this, Milton.

224
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,518
( groans )

225
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,323
<i>( strikes match )</i>

226
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,447
( faint gasp )

227
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:12,043
<i>( knocks )</i>

228
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,912
Come in.
<i>( door opens )</i>

229
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:21,085
You asked me
to keep tabs on her.

230
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,424
That's right.

231
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,645
She's going back to the prison

232
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,597
and has requested
my assistance in escaping.

233
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,650
Her words, not mine.

234
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,488
Help her.

235
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,325
Okay, do you really
want me to do that,

236
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,943
or is this some sort of test?

237
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:48,630
( chuckles )

238
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:52,133
If she asks for help,

239
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,385
help her.

240
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,172
Milton.

241
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,391
Good work.

242
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,261
( snarling )

243
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,703
Hey, you!

244
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:35,905
( snarling )

245
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:38,708
Oh, shit.
Andrea!

246
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:43,412
Pin it down.

247
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:45,464
Don't let it up.

248
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:59,529
Just a little more.

249
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:20,082
( grunts )

250
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:30,309
Lift its head.

251
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:33,812
Force it down.

252
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:36,732
- Hey, hold it! Hold it!
- Milton: I'm trying.

253
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:52,414
( snarling ) Watch out.

254
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:02,591
All right.

255
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:06,845
Can we finish this up, please?

256
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,630
I got it.
I got it.

257
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:28,250
( snarling )

258
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:48,604
Smart to stay fit.

259
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:53,475
Don't leave out the cardio.

260
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:58,280
<i>You know, if we're gonna</i>
<i>live under the same roof,</i>

261
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,916
we should clear the air.

262
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,318
This whole hunting
you down thing,

263
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,989
<i>that was just business.</i>

264
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,624
<i>Carrying out orders.</i>

265
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,544
Hmm.
Like the Gestapo.

266
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:13,963
Yeah.
Exactly.

267
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,717
<i>I've done a lot of things</i>
<i>I ain't proud of.</i>

268
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:21,220
Before and after.

269
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:27,777
Anyway, hope we
can get past it.

270
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:32,314
Let bygones be bygones.

271
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,791
It's a diversionary tactic.

272
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,692
It keeps the walkers away.

273
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,996
Didn't work so well
with those two.

274
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:51,500
You got a camp?

275
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,422
It's just us.

276
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:02,144
We have a town.
It's walled.

277
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:04,213
Milton:
There's about 70 of us.

278
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:08,100
You take people in?

279
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:10,820
We do.

280
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,322
- I'll take them back.
- Are you sure?

281
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,578
- If he asks, just--
- I'll handle it.

282
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:22,281
I'm better with him
than I am with them.

283
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:25,868
Thank you so much.

284
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:27,837
We've had a rough
couple of days.

285
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:30,456
- Where you going?
- Got to finish my run.

286
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:32,791
- By yourself?
- I'll be fin3.

287
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,044
Got my guardian angel here.

288
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:37,364
- Need any help?
- Nope.

289
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:39,583
I'm good.

290
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,378
( snarling )

291
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,658
Carl:
<i>Psst.</i>

292
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:18,493
Something weird out there.

293
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,010
( whispers ) Andrea.

294
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:37,245
<i>Get your dad and the others.</i>

295
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,591
Go.

296
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,928
Clear!

297
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:32,267
- Are you alone?
- Open the gate.

298
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,902
Are you alone?!

299
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:35,704
Rick!

300
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,363
Open it.

301
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,649
Hands up!
Turn around.

302
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,919
Turn around now!

303
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,494
( snarling ) ( screams )

304
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:02,047
All right. Get down,
on the floor.

305
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,219
I asked if you were alone.

306
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,638
I am.

307
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,994
Welcome back.

308
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,497
Get up.

309
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,525
After you saved me,
we thought you were dead.

310
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,530
Hershel, my God.

311
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:16,371
I can't believe this.

312
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,775
Where's Shane?

313
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,917
And Lori?

314
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:36,341
Hershel: She had a girl.
Lori didn't survive.

315
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,926
Neither did T-Dog.

316
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,396
I'm so sorry.

317
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,516
Carl.

318
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,443
Rick, I--

319
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,151
You all live here?

320
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,754
Here and the cell block.

321
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,990
There?

322
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:12,126
Well, can I go in?

323
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:16,014
- I won't allow that.
- I'm not an enemy, Rick.

324
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,216
We had that field and courtyard

325
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,601
until your boyfriend
tore down the fence

326
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,437
with a truck and shot us up.

327
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,106
He said you fired first.

328
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,892
Well, he's lying.

329
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,280
He killed an inmate
who survived in here.

330
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,316
We liked him.
He was one of us.

331
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:38,119
I didn't know
anything about that.

332
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,571
As soon as I found out, I came.

333
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:44,909
I didn't even know you were in
Woodbury until after the shoot-out.

334
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,327
That was days ago.

335
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:49,247
I told you, I came
as soon as I could.

336
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,838
- What have you told them?
- Nothing.

337
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,257
I don't get it.
I left Atlanta with you people

338
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,842
and now I'm the odd man out?

339
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:03,978
He almost killed Michonne
and he would have killed us.

340
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,546
With his finger on the trigger.

341
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,315
Isn't he the one
who kidnapped you?

342
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,734
Who beat you?

343
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:14,188
Look,

344
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:17,992
I cannot excuse or explain
what Philip has done.

345
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,945
But I am here trying
to bring us together.

346
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,830
We have to work this out.

347
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,332
There's nothing to work out.

348
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,233
We're gonna kill him.

349
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:29,036
I don't know how
or when, but we will.

350
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:32,757
We can settle this.

351
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,127
There is room at Woodbury
for all of you.

352
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:39,347
( Merle chuckles )
You know better than that.

353
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,084
What makes you think
this man wants to negotiate?

354
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,304
Hershel:
Did he say that?

355
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,055
No.

356
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,758
Rick: Then why did
you come here?

357
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,694
Because he's
gearing up for war.

358
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,114
The people are terrified.
They see you as killers.

359
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,366
They're training to attack.

360
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,235
I'll tell you what.
Next time you see Philip,

361
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:03,571
you tell him I'm gonna
take his other eye.

362
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,873
We're taken too much shit
for too long.

363
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,625
He wants a war?
He's got one.

364
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,079
Rick.

365
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,299
If you don't sit down
and try to work this out,

366
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,752
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

367
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:20,304
He has a whole town.

368
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,124
Look at you.

369
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,644
You've lost so much already.

370
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,148
You can't stand alone anymore.

371
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,983
You want to make
this right, get us inside.

372
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,484
- No.
- Then we got nothing to talk about.

373
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,135
There are innocent people.

374
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:39,840
<i>( door opens, bangs shut )</i>

375
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,842
You poisoned them.

376
00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:52,046
I just told them the truth.

377
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,181
I didn't choose him over you.

378
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:55,883
I wanted a life.

379
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,852
Once we entered Woodbury,
you became hostile.

380
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,272
- That's 'cause I could see it.
- See what?

381
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:05,092
That you were under his spell from
the second you laid eyes on him.

382
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:07,645
- That is not true.
- And you still are.

383
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,281
No, I am there
because those people need me.

384
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:11,865
And what about these people?

385
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,784
I'm trying to save them, too.

386
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:16,070
( laughs )

387
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:19,823
I did not realize the messiah
complex was contagious.

388
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,659
Go to hell, Michonne.

389
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,829
He sent Merle to kill me.

390
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:31,051
Would have sent him to kill you,
too, if you had come with me.

391
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,089
But you didn't, did you?

392
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,790
Hm-mmm.

393
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:39,510
You chose a warm bed
over a friend.

394
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:45,099
That's why I went back
to Woodbury.

395
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,769
Exposed him for what he is.

396
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:53,190
I knew that it would hurt you.

397
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,927
( sighs )

398
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:25,639
Dr. Stevens will be here soon.
We'll get you checked over.

399
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,008
- Thank you.
- No, it's my pleasure.

400
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:29,727
Now you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

401
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,529
We got food,
fresh clothing, hot water.

402
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,616
Normally we'd provide you with
weapons and a car for your journey,

403
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:38,018
but we need all we have.

404
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,353
Looks like you're battening down the hatches.
Were you guys attacked?

405
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:43,523
Yeah, but not by biters.
Some dangerous people out there.

406
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:47,461
They came at us a few days ago.

407
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:49,463
Anyone hurt?

408
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:53,884
There were several fatalities.

409
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:58,505
- Ben: Damn. Sorry.
- Yeah.

410
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,392
Can't be too careful
these days.

411
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:04,261
<i>When you're ready</i>
<i>to travel, head west.</i>

412
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,346
<i>Avoid anything north up 85.</i>

413
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,715
We just came from there.

414
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:11,185
Ran into some
whack-job in a prison.

415
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:20,994
You saw him?

416
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:22,863
Oh, yeah.
Screaming like an idiot.

417
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,898
He's a little unhinged.

418
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,367
But the others seemed decent.

419
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:30,237
Everything seemed cool
until their leader came back

420
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:32,122
and practically shoved
a gun in my face.

421
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,842
You were at the prison?

422
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:38,679
We went in for shelter.
Lost Allen's wife.

423
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,849
This guy Rick showed up
all of sudden, chased us out.

424
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,752
You need help with these guys?
We're in.

425
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:48,105
Well, now, no...

426
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:51,141
we couldn't ask you
to join in our fight.

427
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,926
Look, we don't want
to be out there.

428
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:54,478
It's only a matter
of time before--

429
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,147
No, I understand.

430
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,933
Whatever we got to do
to earn our keep.

431
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,154
Were you inside the prison?

432
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,073
Can you describe the layout?

433
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,076
It's pretty confusing,
but I could try.

434
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:12,279
You get your rest.

435
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,781
We can talk about it tomorrow.

436
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:17,384
As I say, you're welcome to
stay here as long as you like.

437
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:20,954
But you take the night.
Talk it over.

438
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,756
Good night.

439
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,513
You can't leave without
meeting Little Ass-Kicker.

440
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,348
May I hold her?

441
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,600
- Of course.
- Oh.

442
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,635
Got her?

443
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:37,187
I got her.

444
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:40,190
( baby fusses )
Oh, look at you.

445
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:43,110
Let me guess.

446
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,028
Daryl named her
"Ass-Kicker."

447
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,330
( laughs )

448
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,865
That's not really her name.

449
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,534
- Judith.
- Judith.

450
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,819
Hi, Judith.

451
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,089
Oh, how precious are you?

452
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:03,046
What happened to Lori?

453
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,933
During a C-section.

454
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:08,051
Maggie.

455
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,387
- Carl had to--
- Oh, my God.

456
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,341
T-Dog died leading me
to safety.

457
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:18,178
And Shane?

458
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,948
Rick killed him.

459
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,285
The night we left the farm.

460
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:28,071
That whole Randall
thing was a lie.

461
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,240
Shane tried to kill Rick.

462
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:34,127
Shane loved Rick.

463
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,630
Shane loved Lori.

464
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:43,370
Rick's become cold.

465
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:45,339
Unsteady.

466
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,009
He has his reasons.

467
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:55,349
The Governor,
you need to do something.

468
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,550
I am.

469
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:01,321
No, you need to sleep with him.

470
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:03,991
Give him the greatest
night of his life.

471
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:05,826
You get him to drop his guard.

472
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:09,746
Then when he's sleeping,
you can end this.

473
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:36,473
Thanks.

474
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,060
Can you spare it?

475
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,112
Yeah.

476
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,999
Well, take care.

477
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:11,725
Andrea.

478
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,401
Be careful.

479
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,238
You, too.
