[Adam] <i>My investors chuck in,

And in return they get a whole country.
Copper, oil, lithium.

I mean, that's the golden goose, right?

You told me you didn't know Teddy.

<i>Extradition to the UK

[Roxana] <i>If he finds out,
he will kill me.</i>

My father died when I was six.

I watched them dump him at the gates.

also known as Andrew Birch.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,960
His name is Jonathan Pine.

<i>He's in Colombia,
and he's onto our arrangement.</i>

What do you want me to do?

28
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:29,860
He'll have support teams
here and in London.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,460
Identify them and deal with them.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,500
And Pine? Where is he now?

31

[helicopter whirring]

[Sebastián] <i>Thanks, Julio. Exactly.</i>

[in Spanish] <i>This was a brutal and cynical

We needed the fucking money, didn't we?
Or do you have any better ideas, asshole?

[in English] Speak English!

Let me tell you something
about the man you've been dealing with.

74
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,780
He's not a Swiss banker.

75
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,920
He's not a Hong Kong investor.

76
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,500
He doesn't play the piccolo
in a colliery band.

77
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,520
He is a British intelligence agent

78
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,420
with an indecent habit of getting
information people barely knew they had.

79
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,780
Many had been susceptible to this gift.

80
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,160
And I'd lay money that Roxana Bolaños
could be added to that list.

81
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,620
What about you, Teddy?

82

Were you susceptible?

What do you mean?

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,199
Answer the question.

85
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,220
Were you susceptible?

86
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,160
I told Matthew Ellis nothing.

87

And he has achieved nothing.

88

The prosecutor is dead.

89
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,560
We will release the cargo
and deliver it to the Cabreras.

So everything is as we planned.

[in Spanish] Your name is Octavio, right?

107
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
People call me Tavo.

108
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,160
Do you have family you can call?

109
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,920
You're going to be safe here.

Don't leave me with her.

She's one of them.

It's all right. She's on our side.

115

Wait here.

[in English] What are you doing?

117
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,520
You want to tell me what's going on?

118
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
The man you know as Gilberto Hanson…

119
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,400
He's an English arms dealer.

120
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,440
And he and I have…

121

history.

122
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,280
And now he knows I'm here.

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,600
So, I have to get to him
before he gets to me.

- What about your team? Where are they?
- There is no team.

You told me you had support.

Well, there's no one.

127

I'm alone.

What about the guarantees I asked for?

129
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,680
I can't give you any of those.

130
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,799
You played me.

131
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,599
I did what was necessary
to get on the inside.

132

I trusted you with my life.

Do you have any idea
what Teddy will do to me if he finds me?

Which is why I need you to stay here.

Keep your phone off.

136
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,919
Make sure Tavo stays out of sight.
They'll be looking for him.

137
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,520
He's wanted for murder.

138
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,839
- Roxana, I'm serious.
- It's Tavo that we're worried about?

139
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,760
Listen, you chose to work
with these people.

140
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,199
You knew what you were
getting involved with.

141
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Now, I will get you out of this.

142
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,239
- But do not ask me to be grateful.
- You planned this from the minute

143
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,639
- you approached me.
- No.

144
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,799
You lied to me.

145
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,560
You deliberately compromised me.
And now I have nowhere to go.

146
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,639
- I lied to you?
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,920
Let me tell you about
a man called Waleed.

148
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,239
He was my friend. He had three children.

149
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,200
He loved cricket. And he bled out
in my arms because you lied to me.

150
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,199
You helped me for one reason
and one reason only,

151
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
which is to save your own skin.

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,920
you… like my skin, don't you?

154
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,920
Stay here.

155
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,440
I'll come back.

156
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Do what you want.

157
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,080
I will never ask anything
of you ever again.

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
Alex is dead.

162
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,919
Yeah, you said.
You were returning his body from Spain.

163
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,760
- What was left of it.
- That's right.

164
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,080
Not much of it, was there?

165
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,400
Taken just yesterday in Medellín.

166
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,800
You've been secretly
filming this house, Basil.

167
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,240
And you met Adam Holywell and
tricked him into giving you his phone.

168
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,080
In the church after Rex's funeral
you promised me…

169
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
that you were loyal.

170
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
[scoffs]

171
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,880
Where's Jonathan Pine?

172
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,120
Hmm?

173
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:33,050
I have no idea what you're talking about.

174
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,380
Bullshit.

175
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Don't fucking lie to me!

176
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm gonna ask you again.

177
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,880
Where is Jonathan Pine?

178
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
[tense music]

179
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,240
Charlie.

180
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,200
Let's see if we can jog
his memory, shall we?

181
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,600
[door opening and closing]

182
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
[chuckles]

183
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Frisky.

184
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,440
- Thank you for answering the call.
- Oh, no. Anything for you, chief.

185
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,759
[Roper] Battle Boy will show you the way.

186
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,839
If you're lucky,
you might get a bottle of beer.

187
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,240
[Frisky] How you doing?

188
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,440
Who are they?

189
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,400
[Roper] Friends from home.
They're gonna help us find your boy.

190
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,320
Let me do it.

191
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,239
No, no, no.

192
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,799
You focus on the shipment.

193
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
The new prosecutor's gonna
release the cargo this morning.

194
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,159
Fly to Cartagena.

195
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,959
Get the cargo out of that port.

196
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
That's transportation.

197
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
I have boys who can do that.

198
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,520
Teddy, listen to me.

199
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
A man hell-bent on revenge
guarantees only his own demise.

200
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,560
You and I have to focus
on the task at hand.

201
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,000
José Cabrera, the anniversary.

202
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,640
Kings of America, remember?

203
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
[phone ringing]

204
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Answer it.

205
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
[phone ringing]

206
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
[in Spanish] Who's this?

207
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
[Jonathan, in English] <i>Put him on.</i>

208
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
[intriguing music]

209
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,920
[Roper] <i>Well, you are trouble.</i>

210
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,200
The hilltop restaurant.

211
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,360
I booked a table
under the name of Andrew Birch.

212
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
<i>1 p.m.</i>

213
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,879
<i>Come alone.</i>

214
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,160
[line disconnects]

[tense music]

218
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
[man] Mr Hanson,
your friend is already here.

219
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,760
- Sorry I couldn't clear the restaurant.
- No, no. Don't you worry, Santiago.

220
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,360
Andrew's an old colleague from London.

221
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,400
- Top man.
- Okay, sir. Thank you.

222
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,600
Andrew.

223
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
Gilberto.

224
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
Been too long.

225
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,000
Can I get you anything, sir?

226
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,839
Uh… Two of your delicious juices.

227
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,199
And don't bother with menus.
We'll both have the steak.

228
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,560
- And I want to see blood. <i>Sangre!</i>
- Yes, sir.

229
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,439
Okay, sir. [laughs]

230
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
[birds chirping]

231
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,199
I should probably warn you
that this place is owned by a pal.

232
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,680
So if you try anything,
you will come badly unstuck.

233
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,400
That's why I chose it.

234
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,360
I wanted you to feel safe.

235
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,399
I, on the other hand,
could have had a bullet

236
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
put in your skull on the drive up here.

237
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,600
But you didn't.

238
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,480
There's always the drive down.

239
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,520
[in Spanish] Thank you.

240
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,120
[Jonathan] Thank you.

241
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,279
[in English] You look older.

242
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,000
[chuckles] Yeah.

243
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
Well, I'm certainly wiser.

244
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
How's Jed?

245
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,720
Glowing, is she?

246
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
I haven't seen her since Cairo.

247
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,320
Well, that's probably best
for her health.

248
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,800
And Angela Burr?

249
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,760
You've spoken to her about all this?

250
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,080
Angela Burr is a coward.

251
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,160
That's a bit harsh.

252
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,279
She made an informed choice.

253
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
She lied to me.

254
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
So who knows you're here?

255
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,319
- Nobody.
- Oh, bollocks.

256
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,399
[Jonathan] Mm-mmm.

257
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,480
You always have support.
Everyone wants to help Jonathan Pine.

258
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,480
Not this time. I'm alone.

259
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,000
It's just you and me.

260
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Well, if that's true, you're either
very confident or rather desperate.

261
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,680
I have the shipment list.

262
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
I know who the arms are being sold to.

263
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,160
I also know

264
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,160
that you're using Aurora,

265
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,960
Teddy's kind hearted charity,

266
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,239
as a front for the recruitment
of young soldiers.

267
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,800
Children to start and fight a rebel war.

268
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,240
And I have Roxana Bolaños ready
to turn state witness to save her skin.

269
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
I'm not desperate.

270
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,080
Well, then, what do you want from me?

271
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,560
I want you to hand yourself in.

272
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,960
Bring your collaborators down with you.

273
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,720
Mayra Cavendish,
the British founders, all of them.

274
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,040
And why would I do that?

275
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,880
Because I'm going to
break this operation.

276
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,240
And when I do,

277
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,160
you will have failed to repay
your Syrian debt of 300 million dollars.

278
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,640
And given the kind of people they are,
I don't think you want that.

279
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,159
I'll tell you why I think you're here.

280
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Go ahead.

281
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,640
You've got nothing on me.

282
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Nothing.

283
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,720
I've never even met this Roxana Bolaños.

284
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,560
You can't connect me with Barquero
or the Cabrera operation.

285
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,240
All I am is a name
and not even the right one.

286
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,400
What about Mayra Cavendish?

287
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,160
- The British government?
- Oh.

288
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,200
What do you really have on them?
A piece of paper. No names mentioned.

289
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,760
Page seven in the Guardian,
if you're lucky.

290
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,400
As for me, you'll never get close.

291
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,840
[in Spanish] Thanks.

292
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,560
[in English]
I'm in fortress Colombia now, Jonathan.

293
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,560
And as of yesterday,
the walls just got a little bit thicker.

294
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,520
If you're so confident,
why'd you bother to come?

295
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,360
I hate mess.

296
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,880
I want this cleared out.

297
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,640
I also have
inexplicable affection for you.

298
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,280
Now, look here.
I'm going to make you an offer.

299
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,839
It's a little different to yours,
but in my opinion, it's more achievable.

300
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,320
Alejandro Gualteros is dead.

301
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,400
The impoundment order
will be lifted within the hour.

302
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,240
In a few days, the shipment
will reach its final destination.

303
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,000
And in a few weeks,
the first guns will fire.

304
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,320
Chaos and carnage will ensue.

305
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,160
More guns will be needed.
More money, more young flesh.

306
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,720
You can't prevent it.

307
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,240
So stop trying.

308
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
Instead, you leave this restaurant
after our delightful lunch together.

309
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,159
You drive to your safe house,
you pick up the Bolaños girl,

310
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,640
you bring her and the document
you have in your possession to me.

311
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
And then you disappear.

312
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,200
In exchange, I wire
Matthew Ellis 50 million dollars.

313
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
For real.

314
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,280
Singapore, Zurich, wherever you want.

315
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,240
No one knows you're here.

316
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,680
Start your life again.

317
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
[intriguing music]

318
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,720
Why would I do that?

319
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,080
To be a free man.

320
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Jonathan.

321
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,279
You can't tell me that you've
forgotten the beach in Majorca.

322
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,639
I told you then what it takes to see
the chaos and grab your chance.

323
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,279
- I saw the fire in your eyes.
- I was playing a role.

324
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Well, you're always
doing that, aren't you?

325
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,239
Andrew Birch books the table.
Thomas Quince eats the steak.

326
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
Matthew Ellis downs the wine.
No, no, no, I…

327
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,840
I struck a chord in you that day.

328
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,960
You crave danger. You need the kick.

329
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,040
Sex with another man's girl.

330
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,800
The smell of death in your nostrils
like napalm in a Turkish valley.

331
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,960
And above all, you need me.

332
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,760
If you came here to win my soul,

333
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
you can forget it.

334
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,880
I came here to offer you the world.

335
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,680
It's at your feet.
Just bend down and pick it up.

336
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,440
You can't offer me the world.

337
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,560
You're just a con-man.

338
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,560
Even when you're stretched out stone-cold
dead on a slab of Syrian concrete,

339
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
you're lying.

340
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,919
Why should I believe a word you say?

341
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,200
Because you dream of me every night.

342
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,640
Just as I dream of you.

343
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,640
Yesterday, a good man

344
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,439
was murdered in a Medellín wasteland
with a bullet in his skull.

345
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,999
And I failed to stop it.
I won't fail again.

346
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
Conscience and shame.

347
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,159
The shackles of slaves.

348
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,279
Conscience is what makes us human.

349
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,799
- Your father teach you that?
- Yes.

350
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,119
Is that what led him to a pointless
death on a street in Belfast?

351
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,959
Blown to bits by his selfless
commitment to service?

352
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,239
That's it. That's it. There.

353
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,120
That's the hot blood of truth.

354
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,199
Go on, Jonathan. Do it!
Stick it right through my heart.

355
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,039
But before you do that, know this.

356
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,200
Your father's values are dying.

357
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,520
Mine are in the ascendant.

358
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,320
My father loved me.

359
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,280
What about yours?

360
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,440
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

361
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,760
I'm going to call you on this phone.

362
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,320
You'll agree to hand yourself in.

363
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,760
If you don't,

364
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,880
I will destroy you.

365
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,200
Thanks for the steak.

366
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,680
You are at a fork
in the road, my pilgrim.

367
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
Choose carefully.

Martín.

371
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Two men. In a black Ford. To your left.

372
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,120
- Did you get it all?
<i>- I think so.</i>

373
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,960
<i>Head to our meeting point.</i>

374
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,760
[Martín] <i>Take the scenic route.
I need some time.</i>

375
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Okay.

[intriguing music]

377
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,080
He's alone. Easy to say goodbye.

378

[Roper] <i>No.</i>

379
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,520
Follow him.
Find out where he's keeping the girl.

[in Spanish] Fill up the red car.
Slowly and carefully.

384
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,080
[in English] Your friend Jane called me.

385
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,760
She's still in Medellín.

386
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,040
She's trying to contact
Chief Justice Consuelo Arbenz.

387
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,680
She should have left.

388
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
She should be in Europe by now.

389
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,800
It seems you inspire
loyalty, Mr Robinson.

390
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
Go back to La Estancia.

391
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
Keep listening.
I'll see you in Medellín. Okay?

392
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Okay.

393
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
[in Spanish] Men's bathroom.
They're outside, waiting.

At the back.

[in English]
Where the fuck are you going?

396
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,440
No. No. Fuck this.

[tense music]

398
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,599
[in Spanish] Excuse me.
Do you have a light?

399
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,759
I don't speak Spanish.

400
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
- [in English] You're tourist here?
- Yeah. Fuck off!

Consuelo Arbenz.

405

My name is Jane.

406
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm a friend of Alejandro Gualteros.

407

Uh huh.

408

[in Spanish] Thank you, Minister,
for your concern.

412
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:29,200
Yes, I've been offered
military protection by General Sánchez.

413
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:30,885
They're with me now.

414
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,359
[in English] Yeah, I can see.

415
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,360
It's because there's a coup being
planned in your country, Consuelo.

416
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
And you're going to help me stop it.

417
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,080
[Viktor, in Spanish] Open it.

[Roper] <i>I just picked
him up along the way.</i>

- Whoa! Let me explain.
- What the fuck is this?

451
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,039
I recorded this conversation
yesterday afternoon.

452
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,319
Roper is talking to his confidant,
Lord Alexander Langbourne.

453
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,297
You're fucking lying.

454
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,400
Langbourne gave Roper a British passport

455
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,947
and a brochure for a house
in the heart of England.

456
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:42,400
Extremely beautiful.

457
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,400
But it's not for you.

458
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,720
Did Roper tell you who I am?
I'm a British intelligence agent.

459
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,039
I infiltrated an armed operation he was
running in Cairo in Egypt nine years ago.

460
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,599
I betrayed him to his captors.

461
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,240
I took his money.
That's the money you've been paying back.

462
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,919
From the moment he arrived in Colombia,
he's had one aim,

463
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,880
to settle his debts and get home.

464
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,279
- And he's used you to do it.
- You're lying.

465
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,800
- I'm not lying.
- Shut the fuck up!

466
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,440
- Stop playing with me.
- What did he tell you?

467
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,639
That Barquero was just
the beginning of something bigger?

468
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,080
That you'd rule this continent together?
Is that what he told you?

469
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,080
I know Roper is your father.

470
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,719
- I went to your mother's grave.
- Don't talk about my mother, asshole.

471
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,039
I saw the flower you pay
to be placed on it every month.

472
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,560
I spoke to your sister Clara.

473
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,400
I've been to the monastery
where you were brought up.

474
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,559
Every year you waited
for him in the black car.

475
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,560
You lived for that visit.
Just as you've lived for him ever since.

476
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,960
What the fuck do you want from me?

477
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,240
Play the last file.

478
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,479
[Roper] <i>There's something I want
you to do when you get back.</i>

[Sandy] <i>Sure. Anything in my power.</i>

480
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
[Roper] <i>It's Danny.</i>

481
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,800
<i>I want him back with me
at the Oxfordshire house.</i>

482
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,320
<i>I've lost ten years of my boy's life.</i>

483
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,800
<i>- He's away at boarding school.
- Then take him out!</i>

484
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,800
<i>Danny is my family.</i>

485
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,560
<i>He's my only son and heir.</i>

486
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
<i>He's mine.</i>

487
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,160
Danny Onslow Roper.

488
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,200
Did Roper tell you about him?

489
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,560
His other son.

490
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,040
Did he? Did he?

491
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,680
- Did Roper tell you about Danny?
- [in Spanish] Just shut up!

492
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,239
[in English] Teddy. Teddy, listen.

493
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,080
- Who the fuck are you?
- Listen. The son he prizes

494
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,560
is sitting in an English
schoolroom right now.

495
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
He's used you, Teddy.

496
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,639
Your love and your devotion.

497
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,039
He used you like a dog because

498
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,679
- it's not worth it to keep you alive.
- [in Spanish] Shut up, shut up!

499
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,439
[in English] It's the truth.
This is who he is.

500
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,839
You don't deserve this, Teddy.

501
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,860
No!

502
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,440
[dramatic music]

503
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,800
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

504
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
It's okay.

[music ends]

506
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,160
When did you last see your sister?

507
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,600
She's been waiting for you.

508
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
She's here.

509
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480

[in Spanish] Eduardo?

513
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,600
Is it really you?

514
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,360
My little brother…

515
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Clara?

516
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
I thought I'd never see you again.

517
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,919
[sobs] Where were you?

518
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,080
I'm sorry.

519
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,920
I'm sorry.

520
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,960
Forgive me.

521
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,240
Forgive me.

[emotional music]

523

You don't know what I've done.

524
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,080
- Forgive me.
- My love.

525
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,080
Forgive me.

526
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,760
Forgive me.

527
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,079
[in English] What does he have,
Juan, besides the girl?

528
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,280
What am I not seeing?

529
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,160
[scoffs] Nothing. He's bluffing.

530
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,720
- Revisit every place he's been.
- Come on, Richard.

531
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,120
- We've done it.
- Well, do it again.

532
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,000
Every hotel, shop, restaurant.

533
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,559
[Juan] Okay.

534
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,720

[dogs running]

537
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,560
Come on. Come here.

538
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,680
Come here. Good girl. Good girl.

539
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,360
Yes, I know, I know.

[dog whines]

543
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,080
Good walk today, Juan Miguel?

544
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Yes, sir.

545
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,920
[Roper] <i>Usual route?</i>

546
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,400
[Juan Miguel] <i>Yes, sir. By the woods.</i>

547
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,640
Maximum range to the listener?

548
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,440
It's a supermarket product.

549
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,520
No more than 200 metres.

550
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Find him.

551
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,440
[bell ringing]

552
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
[tense music]

553
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,160
Right here, Mr Hanson.

[grunts]

556
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,479
[in Spanish] Stop!

557
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
[tense music]

558
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,559
Stop! Stop!

559
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,560
[gunshots]

560
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,520
[gunshots]

561
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,080
[Teddy, in English]
It's an electromagnetic weapon.

562
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,680
British-made.

563
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,560
José Cabrera's men will drive
the weapon into the middle of Medellín

564
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,760
during the celebrations
of the anniversary of the peace.

565
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,840
When it detonates,
it will plunge the city into darkness.

566
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,520
Chaos.

567
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,640
Homes and hospitals without power.

568
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,400
People will die.

569
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,120
Looting will break out
and the government will be blamed.

570
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,840
And then we will send our army
to restore security in the country.

571
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,200
How will you get
the weapon to José Cabrera?

572
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,320
[Teddy] There is a military base
a few hours from here.

573
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,320
I drive the truck there now.

574
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,240
Tomorrow the weapon will
be dropped by parachute

575
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,280
in Cabrera's camp in the jungle.

576
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,840
[Jonathan sighs]

577
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,280
I need to find a way
to divert that plane.

578
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,480
[Teddy] Only Cabrera can do that.

579
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,560
Okay, well, I need the plane's details.
Anything you can get.

580
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,360
Eduardo.

581
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,080
Be careful.

582
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,520
You too.

583
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,080
- All good?
- [Viktor] Yeah, yeah.

584
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,480
[in Spanish] Let's go.

585
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,840
- [in English] Good.
- [person whistles]

586
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,800
Let's go. [speaks Spanish]

587
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
[Juan] Richard!

588
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,560
[tense music]

- [gunshots]
- [dogs whimper]

[birds chirping]

591
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,920
Leave me alone.

592
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,800
Do you not understand
plain fucking English?

593
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,440
I said alone!

595
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,520
Is that Teddy?

596
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,080
Answer it.

597
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,280
What the fuck do you want, Roxana?

598
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,920
[dramatic music]

599
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

600
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,960
It was a close call,
but I needed the exercise.

601
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,720
You shouldn't be here.
You should have left.

602
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,800
Yeah, well, I told you,
I'm just not the leaving type.

603
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,600
Where's Teddy?

604
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,639
Teddy's with the cargo.

605
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,999
[Sally] <i>Do you really think
he's gonna come through?</i>

606
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,560
[Jonathan sighs] <i>I don't know.</i>

607
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,920
[speaks Spanish]

608
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,880
- Teddy, how are you?
- All good.

609
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,600
Okay! Gentlemen, let's go!

610
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,279
Unload everything that's in the truck!

611
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,720
And get it on the plane!

612
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,960
[Basil, in English]
<i>It's true. I was on to you.</i>

613
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,920
You've been keeping things from me.

614
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,199
Spinning me half truths.
Treating me like a bloody fool.

615
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,600
So I followed you.

616
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,320
I found this house.

617
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,359
I tricked Adam Holywell.
It wasn't rocket science.

618
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,680
The man's a moron.

619
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,279
I know there's a game on. Colombia.

620
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,999
Arms smuggling, securing mineral
deposits, sponsoring regime change.

621
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,599
What do you know
about Jonathan Pine's plan?

622
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Nothing.

623
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,079
I didn't even know
that prick was still alive.

624
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,280
Whoever lied about his body,
it wasn't me.

625
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,200
I've given my life to this service.

626
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
[sighs]

627
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,480
Thank you for your hard work, Basil.

628
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,360
And your sacrifice.

629
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,840
But as I said, sometimes
we have to stand on some heads.

630
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,840
- Game over.
- Mayra, please.

631
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,200
Mayra.

632

[car alarm sounding]

636
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,440
My sister's away for the month,
so we can stay here as long as we need.

637
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,440
Everything go all right?

638
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,640
It's all good.
They're loading the plane now.

639
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,760
It'll be ready to fly tomorrow.

640
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,399
Your phone was switched off at the port.

641
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,440
I know, I'm sorry.

642
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,200
I was doing some paperwork.

643
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,920
Didn't want to be disturbed.

644
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
You hungry?

645
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,000
Fats has left you something.

646
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,400
Best thing about Colombia that woman.

647
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,520
[Frisky] Check under every rug and table.

648
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,639
Uh, the lampshade. Check each plant pot,
behind every picture frame.

649
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,280
Juan, down the lavvy.

650
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,480
[Roper] Any joy, Frisky?

651
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,520
Clear so far, boss.

652
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,999
What happened?

653
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,279
Your English friend has been
listening in on the house.

654
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,880
[Frisky] Hey, fellas. Come on.

655
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,920
How could he do that?

656
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
I don't know.

657
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,520
I suppose one possibility
is that he followed you here.

658
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,320
Which means he's inside the operation.

659
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
What should we do?

660
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,280
You leave that to me.

661
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,560
Don't take it personally.

662
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,560
But when the weather gets rough,
I tighten the ship.

663
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,360
Right, I think I might take a walk.
Just stretch the legs.

664
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,680
Can I walk with you?

665
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,960
No, you get your beauty sleep.

666
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,039
Big day for you tomorrow.

667
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,280
[man] You two guys go across.

668
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,600
Come on, let's go.

669
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
[soldiers speaking Spanish]

670
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,240
Get out of here.

671
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,400
Out!

672
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,400
[man, in English] Guys,
I want every inch of this place scoured.

673
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,080
Hey, guys, check this…
[speaks indistinctly]

674
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,400
[intriguing music]

675
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,880
[intriguing music]

676
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,880
[phone buzzing]

677
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,000
[Sally] Is that him?

678
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,560
[Jonathan] Yeah.

679
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,560
You really did win his heart, didn't you?

680
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Look.

681
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,220
The plane will take off
tomorrow afternoon.

682
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,780
It'll fly to Cabrera's
camp in the jungle.

683
00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:16,503
We have to make sure it never gets there.

684
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,160
[in Spanish] Get out.

685
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,640
Get out!

686
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,480
Come on, move!

687
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,880
[in English] Roxana Bolaños.

688
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,280
My name is Richard Roper.

689
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,320
So I've heard.

690
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,640
My friends call me Dickie.

691
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,080
But you're not one of them.

692
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
You could be, if you do me a favour.

693
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,320
But if you try to deceive me,

694
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,880
I will send you back
to your mother in Miami.

695
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,000
And I will send you
there in 31 shoeboxes.

696
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,880
One box a day for a month.

697
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,640
I'm pretty sure we can keep
you alive for at least a week.

698
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,000
[in Spanish] Clear?

699
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,240
Very clear.

700
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,040
[in English] So what do you want?

701
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,760
I want Jonathan Pine.

702
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,366
[Roxana] Well, now I know his name.
