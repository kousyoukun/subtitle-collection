1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,319
Our paymasters want us at the top table,

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,560
<i>we may have to stand
on some heads to get there.</i>

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,560
Shit.

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:14,279
<i>My investors chuck in,
what, a few hundred million?</i>

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,519
And in return they get a whole country.
Copper, oil, lithium.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,279
I mean, that's the golden goose, right?

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,399
You told me you didn't know Teddy.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,999
<i>Extradition to the UK
and a life in prison.</i>

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,479
<i>Will you get me on the inside?</i>

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,639
<i>If he finds out, he will kill me.</i>

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,439
My father died when I was six.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,479
I watched them dump him at the gates.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,839
<i>Teddy's a cowboy.
He's not fit for civilised company.</i>

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,760
Danny is my only son and heir.

15
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:38,959
Did you steal the shipment list?

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,239
Calling the head of the Supreme Court.

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,879
<i>Consuelo has the authority
to open the shipment.</i>

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Hey!

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,640
<i>Everything's gone wrong.</i>

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,079
<i>- The Hong Kong investor.</i>
- Okay?

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,520
I want his picture.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,200
Alex Goodwin,

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,860
also known as Andrew Birch.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,960
His name is Jonathan Pine.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,780
<i>He's in Colombia,
and he's onto our arrangement.</i>

26
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,400
What do you want me to do?

27
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:29,860
He'll have support teams
here and in London.

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,460
Identify them and deal with them.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,500
And Pine? Where is he now?

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,300
Leave him to me.

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,400
<i>Let's continue with today's news.</i>

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,879
<i>Sebastián, what have you got?</i>

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,520
<i>Thanks, Julio. Exactly.</i>

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,879
<i>The assassin of Alejandro Gualteros
is an ex-guerrilla member</i>

35
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,360
<i>who spent several years in armed combat.</i>

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,360
<i>Octavio Pérez is on the run
and considered highly dangerous.</i>

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,480
<i>Thanks, Sebastián. Sorry to interrupt…</i>

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,040
How much further?

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,480
A couple hours.

40
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,759
<i>This was a brutal and cynical
attack against Alejandro Gualteros.</i>

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,039
<i>Alejandro tirelessly campaigned
for justice in this country.</i>

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
<i>We are at a heightened level of risk.</i>

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,840
<i>I am therefore raising security levels.</i>

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,359
<i>Did you receive the red flag?</i>

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,100
- Yeah.
<i>- Are you moving?</i>

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,559
<i>Yeah, I'm just about to.</i>

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,919
Why haven't you gone already?
Get to the airport now.

48
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,400
<i>- Use the exit parcel provided.</i>
- Okay.

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,180
Yes. It's me.

50
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:32,692
<i>I'm afraid I'm going to have
to cancel our appointment.</i>

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,960
<i>I have guests.</i>

52
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,359
I'll leave you my findings.

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,020
Postmarked, of course.

54
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,060
On A4 lined paper.

55
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:06,266
Mr Karapetian.

56
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,860
Yes. How can I help?

57
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,860
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.

58
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:51,060
<i>He had money that needed cleaning.</i>

59
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,567
<i>He stole it from a Swiss family bank.</i>

60
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,260
<i>It is what we needed.</i>

61
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,759
Did I not tell you…?

62
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,319
We needed the fucking money, didn't we?
Or do you have any better ideas, asshole?

63
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,220
Speak English!

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Let me tell you something
about the man you've been dealing with.

65
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,780
He's not a Swiss banker.

66
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,920
He's not a Hong Kong investor.

67
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,500
He doesn't play the piccolo
in a colliery band.

68
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,520
He is a British intelligence agent

69
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,420
with an indecent habit of getting
information people barely knew they had.

70
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,780
Many had been susceptible to this gift.

71
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,160
And I'd lay money that Roxana Bolaños
could be added to that list.

72
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,620
What about you, Teddy?

73
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,760
Were you susceptible?

74
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,180
What do you mean?

75
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,199
Answer the question.

76
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,220
Were you susceptible?

77
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,160
I told Matthew Ellis nothing.

78
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,013
And he has achieved nothing.

79
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
The prosecutor is dead.

80
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,560
We will release the cargo
and deliver it to the Cabreras.

81
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,680
So everything is as we planned.

82
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,880
No, the plan was no mistakes.

83
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,080
Where are you, Jonathan?

84
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,879
Are you sure it's safe here?

85
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,440
Mm-hmm. Nobody's been here
since my father was killed.

86
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
<i>You should listen to this, Mr Robinson.</i>

87
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,880
<i>Let me explain something
about the man you've been dealing with.</i>

88
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,800
<i>He's not a Swiss banker.</i>

89
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
<i>He's not a Hong Kong investor.</i>

90
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,480
<i>He doesn't play the piccolo
in a colliery band.</i>

91
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,880
<i>He is a British intelligence agent
with an indecent habit of getting…</i>

92
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,920
Your name is Octavio, right?

93
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
People call me Tavo.

94
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,160
Do you have family you can call?

95
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,920
You're going to be safe here.

96
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,920
Until I sort this out.

97
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,520
Okay?

98
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,280
Don't leave me with her.

99
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,040
She's one of them.

100
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,440
It's all right. She's on our side.

101
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
Wait here.

102
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,440
What are you doing?

103
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,520
You want to tell me what's going on?

104
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
The man you know as Gilberto Hanson…

105
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,400
He's an English arms dealer.

106
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,440
And he and I have…

107
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
history.

108
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,280
And now he knows I'm here.

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,600
So, I have to get to him
before he gets to me.

110
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,840
- What about your team? Where are they?
- There is no team.

111
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,360
You told me you had support.

112
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,960
Well, there's no one.

113
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
I'm alone.

114
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,800
What about the guarantees I asked for?

115
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,680
I can't give you any of those.

116
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,799
You played me.

117
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,599
I did what was necessary
to get on the inside.

118
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
I trusted you with my life.

119
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,879
Do you have any idea
what Teddy will do to me if he finds me?

120
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,720
Which is why I need you to stay here.

121
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,200
Keep your phone off.

122
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,919
Make sure Tavo stays out of sight.
They'll be looking for him.

123
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,520
He's wanted for murder.

124
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,839
- Roxana, I'm serious.
- It's Tavo that we're worried about?

125
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,760
Listen, you chose to work
with these people.

126
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,199
You knew what you were
getting involved with.

127
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Now, I will get you out of this.

128
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,239
- But do not ask me to be grateful.
- You planned this from the minute

129
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,639
- you approached me.
- No.

130
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,799
You lied to me.

131
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,560
You deliberately compromised me.
And now I have nowhere to go.

132
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,639
- I lied to you?
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,920
Let me tell you about
a man called Waleed.

134
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,239
He was my friend. He had three children.

135
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,200
He loved cricket. And he bled out
in my arms because you lied to me.

136
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,199
You helped me for one reason
and one reason only,

137
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
which is to save your own skin.

138
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
I think…

139
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,920
you… like my skin, don't you?

140
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,920
Stay here.

141
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,440
I'll come back.

142
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Do what you want.

143
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,080
I will never ask anything
of you ever again.

144
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,320
What am I doing here?

145
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,080
I want to talk to you
about Alex Goodwin's whereabouts.

146
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
Alex is dead.

147
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,919
Yeah, you said.
You were returning his body from Spain.

148
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,760
- What was left of it.
- That's right.

149
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,080
Not much of it, was there?

150
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,400
Taken just yesterday in Medellín.

151
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,800
You've been secretly
filming this house, Basil.

152
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,240
And you met Adam Holywell and
tricked him into giving you his phone.

153
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,080
In the church after Rex's funeral
you promised me…

154
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
that you were loyal.

155
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,880
Where's Jonathan Pine?

156
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,120
Hmm?

157
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:33,050
I have no idea what you're talking about.

158
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,380
Bullshit.

159
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Don't fucking lie to me!

160
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm gonna ask you again.

161
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,880
Where is Jonathan Pine?

162
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,240
Charlie.

163
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,200
Let's see if we can jog
his memory, shall we?

164
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Frisky.

165
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,440
- Thank you for answering the call.
- Oh, no. Anything for you, chief.

166
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,759
Battle Boy will show you the way.

167
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,839
If you're lucky,
you might get a bottle of beer.

168
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,240
How you doing?

169
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,440
Who are they?

170
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,400
Friends from home.
They're gonna help us find your boy.

171
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,320
Let me do it.

172
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,239
No, no, no.

173
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,799
You focus on the shipment.

174
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
The new prosecutor's gonna
release the cargo this morning.

175
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,159
Fly to Cartagena.

176
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,959
Get the cargo out of that port.

177
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
That's transportation.

178
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
I have boys who can do that.

179
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,520
Teddy, listen to me.

180
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
A man hell-bent on revenge
guarantees only his own demise.

181
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,560
You and I have to focus
on the task at hand.

182
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,000
José Cabrera, the anniversary.

183
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,640
Kings of America, remember?

184
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Answer it.

185
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
Who's this?

186
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
<i>Put him on.</i>

187
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,920
<i>Well, you are trouble.</i>

188
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,200
The hilltop restaurant.

189
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,360
I booked a table
under the name of Andrew Birch.

190
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
<i>1 p.m.</i>

191
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,879
<i>Come alone.</i>

192
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
Mr Hanson, your friend is already here.

193
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,760
- Sorry I couldn't clear the restaurant.
- No, no. Don't you worry, Santiago.

194
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,360
Andrew's an old colleague from London.

195
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,400
- Top man.
- Okay, sir. Thank you.

196
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,600
Andrew.

197
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
Gilberto.

198
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
Been too long.

199
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,000
Can I get you anything, sir?

200
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,839
Uh… Two of your delicious juices.

201
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,199
And don't bother with menus.
We'll both have the steak.

202
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,560
- And I want to see blood. <i>Sangre!</i>
- Yes, sir.

203
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,439
Okay, sir.

204
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,199
I should probably warn you
that this place is owned by a pal.

205
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,680
So if you try anything,
you will come badly unstuck.

206
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,400
That's why I chose it.

207
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,360
I wanted you to feel safe.

208
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,399
I, on the other hand,
could have had a bullet

209
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
put in your skull on the drive up here.

210
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,600
But you didn't.

211
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,480
There's always the drive down.

212
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,520
Thank you.

213
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,120
Thank you.

214
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,279
You look older.

215
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

216
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
Well, I'm certainly wiser.

217
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
How's Jed?

218
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,720
Glowing, is she?

219
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
I haven't seen her since Cairo.

220
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,320
Well, that's probably best
for her health.

221
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,800
And Angela Burr?

222
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,760
You've spoken to her about all this?

223
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,080
Angela Burr is a coward.

224
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,160
That's a bit harsh.

225
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,279
She made an informed choice.

226
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
She lied to me.

227
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
So who knows you're here?

228
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,319
- Nobody.
- Oh, bollocks.

229
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,399
Mm-mmm.

230
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,480
You always have support.
Everyone wants to help Jonathan Pine.

231
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,480
Not this time. I'm alone.

232
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,000
It's just you and me.

233
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Well, if that's true, you're either
very confident or rather desperate.

234
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,680
I have the shipment list.

235
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
I know who the arms are being sold to.

236
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,160
I also know

237
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,160
that you're using Aurora,

238
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,960
Teddy's kind hearted charity,

239
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,239
as a front for the recruitment
of young soldiers.

240
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,800
Children to start and fight a rebel war.

241
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,240
And I have Roxana Bolaños ready
to turn state witness to save her skin.

242
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
I'm not desperate.

243
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,080
Well, then, what do you want from me?

244
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,560
I want you to hand yourself in.

245
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,960
Bring your collaborators down with you.

246
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,720
Mayra Cavendish,
the British founders, all of them.

247
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,040
And why would I do that?

248
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,880
Because I'm going to
break this operation.

249
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,240
And when I do,

250
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,160
you will have failed to repay
your Syrian debt of 300 million dollars.

251
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,640
And given the kind of people they are,
I don't think you want that.

252
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,159
I'll tell you why I think you're here.

253
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Go ahead.

254
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,640
You've got nothing on me.

255
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Nothing.

256
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,720
I've never even met this Roxana Bolaños.

257
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,560
You can't connect me with Barquero
or the Cabrera operation.

258
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,240
All I am is a name
and not even the right one.

259
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,400
What about Mayra Cavendish?

260
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,160
- The British government?
- Oh.

261
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,200
What do you really have on them?
A piece of paper. No names mentioned.

262
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,760
Page seven in the Guardian,
if you're lucky.

263
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,400
As for me, you'll never get close.

264
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,840
Thanks.

265
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,560
I'm in fortress Colombia now, Jonathan.

266
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,560
And as of yesterday,
the walls just got a little bit thicker.

267
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,520
If you're so confident,
why'd you bother to come?

268
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,360
I hate mess.

269
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,880
I want this cleared out.

270
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,640
I also have
inexplicable affection for you.

271
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,280
Now, look here.
I'm going to make you an offer.

272
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,839
It's a little different to yours,
but in my opinion, it's more achievable.

273
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,320
Alejandro Gualteros is dead.

274
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,400
The impoundment order
will be lifted within the hour.

275
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,240
In a few days, the shipment
will reach its final destination.

276
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,000
And in a few weeks,
the first guns will fire.

277
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,320
Chaos and carnage will ensue.

278
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,160
More guns will be needed.
More money, more young flesh.

279
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,720
You can't prevent it.

280
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,240
So stop trying.

281
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
Instead, you leave this restaurant
after our delightful lunch together.

282
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,159
You drive to your safe house,
you pick up the Bolaños girl,

283
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,640
you bring her and the document
you have in your possession to me.

284
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
And then you disappear.

285
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,200
In exchange, I wire
Matthew Ellis 50 million dollars.

286
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
For real.

287
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,280
Singapore, Zurich, wherever you want.

288
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,240
No one knows you're here.

289
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,680
Start your life again.

290
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,720
Why would I do that?

291
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,080
To be a free man.

292
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Jonathan.

293
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,279
You can't tell me that you've
forgotten the beach in Majorca.

294
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,639
I told you then what it takes to see
the chaos and grab your chance.

295
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,279
- I saw the fire in your eyes.
- I was playing a role.

296
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Well, you're always
doing that, aren't you?

297
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,239
Andrew Birch books the table.
Thomas Quince eats the steak.

298
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
Matthew Ellis downs the wine.
No, no, no, I…

299
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,840
I struck a chord in you that day.

300
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,960
You crave danger. You need the kick.

301
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,040
Sex with another man's girl.

302
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,800
The smell of death in your nostrils
like napalm in a Turkish valley.

303
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,960
And above all, you need me.

304
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,760
If you came here to win my soul,

305
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
you can forget it.

306
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,880
I came here to offer you the world.

307
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,680
It's at your feet.
Just bend down and pick it up.

308
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,440
You can't offer me the world.

309
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,560
You're just a con-man.

310
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,560
Even when you're stretched out stone-cold
dead on a slab of Syrian concrete,

311
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
you're lying.

312
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,919
Why should I believe a word you say?

313
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,200
Because you dream of me every night.

314
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,640
Just as I dream of you.

315
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,640
Yesterday, a good man

316
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,439
was murdered in a Medellín wasteland
with a bullet in his skull.

317
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,999
And I failed to stop it.
I won't fail again.

318
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
Conscience and shame.

319
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,159
The shackles of slaves.

320
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,279
Conscience is what makes us human.

321
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,799
- Your father teach you that?
- Yes.

322
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,119
Is that what led him to a pointless
death on a street in Belfast?

323
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,959
Blown to bits by his selfless
commitment to service?

324
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,239
That's it. That's it. There.

325
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,120
That's the hot blood of truth.

326
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,199
Go on, Jonathan. Do it!
Stick it right through my heart.

327
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,039
But before you do that, know this.

328
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,200
Your father's values are dying.

329
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,520
Mine are in the ascendant.

330
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,320
My father loved me.

331
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,280
What about yours?

332
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,440
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

333
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,760
I'm going to call you on this phone.

334
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,320
You'll agree to hand yourself in.

335
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,760
If you don't,

336
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,880
I will destroy you.

337
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,200
Thanks for the steak.

338
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,680
You are at a fork
in the road, my pilgrim.

339
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
Choose carefully.

340
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Martín.

341
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Two men. In a black Ford. To your left.

342
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,120
- Did you get it all?
<i>- I think so.</i>

343
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,960
<i>Head to our meeting point.</i>

344
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,760
<i>Take the scenic route. I need some time.</i>

345
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Okay.

346
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,080
He's alone. Easy to say goodbye.

347
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
<i>No.</i>

348
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,520
Follow him.
Find out where he's keeping the girl.

349
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,840
Fill up the red car.
Slowly and carefully.

350
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,080
Your friend Jane called me.

351
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,760
She's still in Medellín.

352
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,040
She's trying to contact
Chief Justice Consuelo Arbenz.

353
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,680
She should have left.

354
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
She should be in Europe by now.

355
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,800
It seems you inspire
loyalty, Mr Robinson.

356
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
Go back to La Estancia.

357
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
Keep listening.
I'll see you in Medellín. Okay?

358
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Okay.

359
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
Men's bathroom. They're outside, waiting.

360
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
At the back.

361
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,080
Where the fuck are you going?

362
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,440
No. No. Fuck this.

363
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,599
Excuse me. Do you have a light?

364
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,759
I don't speak Spanish.

365
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
- You're tourist here?
- Yeah. Fuck off!

366
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,400
Round the back. He's gone out the window.

367
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,600
Consuelo Arbenz.

368
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,799
My name is Jane.

369
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm a friend of Alejandro Gualteros.

370
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Uh huh.

371
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,760
<i>He was killed because he was
trying to meet with you, Chief Justice.</i>

372
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,320
<i>I know who killed him, and I know why.</i>

373
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,840
Thank you, Minister, for your concern.

374
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:29,200
Yes, I've been offered
military protection by General Sánchez.

375
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:30,885
They're with me now.

376
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,359
Yeah, I can see.

377
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,360
It's because there's a coup being
planned in your country, Consuelo.

378
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
And you're going to help me stop it.

379
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,080
Open it.

380
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,840
It's all here.

381
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,399
It'll do.

382
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,920
Who's this?

383
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,400
Who the fuck is this?

384
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
<i>You look anxious.</i>

385
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,880
<i>Meet me where we took
the boat trip. 20 minutes.</i>

386
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,440
<i>Come alone and I'll tell you the truth
about Richard Onslow Roper.</i>

387
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:34,200
<i>Fellow called Eduardo dos Santos.</i>

388
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,660
<i>Where did you find him?</i>

389
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,640
<i>I just picked him up along the way.</i>

390
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,000
<i>Wild past,</i>

391
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,560
<i>but loyal.</i>

392
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:46,200
<i>Like one of these.</i>

393
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,600
<i>Does he know the game?</i>

394
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,080
<i>He knows as much as he needs to.</i>

395
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,840
<i>And when all this is over,</i>

396
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,839
<i>what do we do?
You're gonna bring him back with you?</i>

397
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,360
<i>Teddy in the Athenaeum.</i>

398
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,320
<i>I dread to think.</i>

399
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,520
<i>No, Teddy's a cowboy.</i>

400
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,800
<i>You should see him on a horse.</i>

401
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,480
<i>A thing of beauty.</i>

402
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,240
<i>He's not fit for civilised company.</i>

403
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
<i>Then we can get rid of him.</i>

404
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,200
<i>It's easily done, I imagine.</i>

405
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,560
<i>Let's jump that fence
when we come to it, shall we?</i>

406
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,479
- Whoa! Let me explain.
- What the fuck is this?

407
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,039
I recorded this conversation
yesterday afternoon.

408
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,319
Roper is talking to his confidant,
Lord Alexander Langbourne.

409
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,297
You're fucking lying.

410
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,400
Langbourne gave Roper a British passport

411
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,947
and a brochure for a house
in the heart of England.

412
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:42,400
Extremely beautiful.

413
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,400
But it's not for you.

414
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,720
Did Roper tell you who I am?
I'm a British intelligence agent.

415
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,039
I infiltrated an armed operation he was
running in Cairo in Egypt nine years ago.

416
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,599
I betrayed him to his captors.

417
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,240
I took his money.
That's the money you've been paying back.

418
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,919
From the moment he arrived in Colombia,
he's had one aim,

419
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,880
to settle his debts and get home.

420
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,279
- And he's used you to do it.
- You're lying.

421
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,800
- I'm not lying.
- Shut the fuck up!

422
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,440
- Stop playing with me.
- What did he tell you?

423
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,639
That Barquero was just
the beginning of something bigger?

424
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,080
That you'd rule this continent together?
Is that what he told you?

425
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,080
I know Roper is your father.

426
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,719
- I went to your mother's grave.
- Don't talk about my mother, asshole.

427
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,039
I saw the flower you pay
to be placed on it every month.

428
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,560
I spoke to your sister Clara.

429
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,400
I've been to the monastery
where you were brought up.

430
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,559
Every year you waited
for him in the black car.

431
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,560
You lived for that visit.
Just as you've lived for him ever since.

432
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,960
What the fuck do you want from me?

433
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,240
Play the last file.

434
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,479
<i>There's something I want
you to do when you get back.</i>

435
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,960
<i>Sure. Anything in my power.</i>

436
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
<i>It's Danny.</i>

437
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,800
<i>I want him back with me
at the Oxfordshire house.</i>

438
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,320
<i>I've lost ten years of my boy's life.</i>

439
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,800
<i>- He's away at boarding school.
- Then take him out!</i>

440
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,800
<i>Danny is my family.</i>

441
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,560
<i>He's my only son and heir.</i>

442
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
<i>He's mine.</i>

443
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,160
Danny Onslow Roper.

444
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,200
Did Roper tell you about him?

445
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,560
His other son.

446
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,040
Did he? Did he?

447
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,680
- Did Roper tell you about Danny?
- Just shut up!

448
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,239
Teddy. Teddy, listen.

449
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,080
- Who the fuck are you?
- Listen. The son he prizes

450
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,560
is sitting in an English
schoolroom right now.

451
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
He's used you, Teddy.

452
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,639
Your love and your devotion.

453
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,039
He used you like a dog because

454
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,679
- it's not worth it to keep you alive.
- Shut up, shut up!

455
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,439
It's the truth. This is who he is.

456
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,839
You don't deserve this, Teddy.

457
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,860
No!

458
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,800
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

459
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
It's okay.

460
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,160
When did you last see your sister?

461
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,600
She's been waiting for you.

462
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
She's here.

463
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,320
Eduardo?

464
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,600
Is it really you?

465
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,360
My little brother…

466
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Clara?

467
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
I thought I'd never see you again.

468
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,919
Where were you?

469
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,080
I'm sorry.

470
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,920
I'm sorry.

471
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,960
Forgive me.

472
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,240
Forgive me.

473
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,080
You don't know what I've done.

474
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,080
- Forgive me.
- My love.

475
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,080
Forgive me.

476
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,760
Forgive me.

477
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,079
What does he have,
Juan, besides the girl?

478
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,280
What am I not seeing?

479
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,160
Nothing. He's bluffing.

480
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,720
- Revisit every place he's been.
- Come on, Richard.

481
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,120
- We've done it.
- Well, do it again.

482
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,000
Every hotel, shop, restaurant.

483
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,559
Okay.

484
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,560
Come on. Come here.

485
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,680
Come here. Good girl. Good girl.

486
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,360
Yes, I know, I know.

487
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,080
Good walk today, Juan Miguel?

488
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Yes, sir.

489
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,920
<i>Usual route?</i>

490
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,400
<i>Yes, sir. By the woods.</i>

491
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,640
Maximum range to the listener?

492
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,440
It's a supermarket product.

493
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,520
No more than 200 metres.

494
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Find him.

495
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,160
Right here, Mr Hanson.

496
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,479
Stop!

497
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,559
Stop! Stop!

498
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,080
It's an electromagnetic weapon.

499
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,680
British-made.

500
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,560
José Cabrera's men will drive
the weapon into the middle of Medellín

501
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,760
during the celebrations
of the anniversary of the peace.

502
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,840
When it detonates,
it will plunge the city into darkness.

503
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,520
Chaos.

504
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,640
Homes and hospitals without power.

505
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,400
People will die.

506
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,120
Looting will break out
and the government will be blamed.

507
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,840
And then we will send our army
to restore security in the country.

508
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,200
How will you get
the weapon to José Cabrera?

509
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,320
There is a military base
a few hours from here.

510
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,320
I drive the truck there now.

511
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,240
Tomorrow the weapon will
be dropped by parachute

512
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,280
in Cabrera's camp in the jungle.

513
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,280
I need to find a way
to divert that plane.

514
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,480
Only Cabrera can do that.

515
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,560
Okay, well, I need the plane's details.
Anything you can get.

516
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,360
Eduardo.

517
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,080
Be careful.

518
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,520
You too.

519
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,080
- All good?
- Yeah, yeah.

520
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,480
Let's go.

521
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,840
Good.

522
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,800
Let's go.

523
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
Richard!

524
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,920
Leave me alone.

525
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,800
Do you not understand
plain fucking English?

526
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,440
I said alone!

527
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,520
Is that Teddy?

528
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,080
Answer it.

529
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,280
What the fuck do you want, Roxana?

530
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

531
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,960
It was a close call,
but I needed the exercise.

532
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,720
You shouldn't be here.
You should have left.

533
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,800
Yeah, well, I told you,
I'm just not the leaving type.

534
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,600
Where's Teddy?

535
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,639
Teddy's with the cargo.

536
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,999
<i>Do you really think
he's gonna come through?</i>

537
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,560
<i>I don't know.</i>

538
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,880
- Teddy, how are you?
- All good.

539
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,600
Okay! Gentlemen, let's go!

540
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,279
Unload everything that's in the truck!

541
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,720
And get it on the plane!

542
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,960
<i>It's true. I was on to you.</i>

543
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,920
You've been keeping things from me.

544
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,199
Spinning me half truths.
Treating me like a bloody fool.

545
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,600
So I followed you.

546
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,320
I found this house.

547
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,359
I tricked Adam Holywell.
It wasn't rocket science.

548
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,680
The man's a moron.

549
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,279
I know there's a game on. Colombia.

550
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,999
Arms smuggling, securing mineral
deposits, sponsoring regime change.

551
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,599
What do you know
about Jonathan Pine's plan?

552
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Nothing.

553
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,079
I didn't even know
that prick was still alive.

554
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,280
Whoever lied about his body,
it wasn't me.

555
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,200
I've given my life to this service.

556
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,480
Thank you for your hard work, Basil.

557
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,360
And your sacrifice.

558
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,840
But as I said, sometimes
we have to stand on some heads.

559
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,840
- Game over.
- Mayra, please.

560
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,200
Mayra.

561
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,440
My sister's away for the month,
so we can stay here as long as we need.

562
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,440
Everything go all right?

563
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,640
It's all good.
They're loading the plane now.

564
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,760
It'll be ready to fly tomorrow.

565
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,399
Your phone was switched off at the port.

566
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,440
I know, I'm sorry.

567
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,200
I was doing some paperwork.

568
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,920
Didn't want to be disturbed.

569
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
You hungry?

570
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,000
Fats has left you something.

571
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,400
Best thing about Colombia that woman.

572
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,520
Check under every rug and table.

573
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,639
Uh, the lampshade. Check each plant pot,
behind every picture frame.

574
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,280
Juan, down the lavvy.

575
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,480
Any joy, Frisky?

576
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,520
Clear so far, boss.

577
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,999
What happened?

578
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,279
Your English friend has been
listening in on the house.

579
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,880
Hey, fellas. Come on.

580
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,920
How could he do that?

581
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
I don't know.

582
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,520
I suppose one possibility
is that he followed you here.

583
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,320
Which means he's inside the operation.

584
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
What should we do?

585
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,280
You leave that to me.

586
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,560
Don't take it personally.

587
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,560
But when the weather gets rough,
I tighten the ship.

588
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,360
Right, I think I might take a walk.
Just stretch the legs.

589
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,680
Can I walk with you?

590
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,960
No, you get your beauty sleep.

591
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,039
Big day for you tomorrow.

592
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,280
You two guys go across.

593
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,600
Come on, let's go.

594
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,240
Get out of here.

595
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,400
Out!

596
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,400
Guys,
I want every inch of this place scoured.

597
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,080
Hey, guys, check this…

598
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,000
Is that him?

599
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,560
Yeah.

600
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,560
You really did win his heart, didn't you?

601
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Look.

602
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,220
The plane will take off
tomorrow afternoon.

603
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,780
It'll fly to Cabrera's
camp in the jungle.

604
00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:16,503
We have to make sure it never gets there.

605
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,160
Get out.

606
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,640
Get out!

607
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,480
Come on, move!

608
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,880
Roxana Bolaños.

609
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,280
My name is Richard Roper.

610
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,320
So I've heard.

611
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,640
My friends call me Dickie.

612
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,080
But you're not one of them.

613
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
You could be, if you do me a favour.

614
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,320
But if you try to deceive me,

615
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,880
I will send you back
to your mother in Miami.

616
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,000
And I will send you
there in 31 shoeboxes.

617
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,880
One box a day for a month.

618
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,640
I'm pretty sure we can keep
you alive for at least a week.

619
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,000
Clear?

620
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,240
Very clear.

621
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,040
So what do you want?

622
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,760
I want Jonathan Pine.

623
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,366
Well, now I know his name.

624
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,393
