00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,586
有何能为您效劳的
Hi, how can I help you?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,714
我是指在最不费力的范围内
And by that I mean, "What's the least
I can do to help you?"

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:07,925
我要来一份汉堡加薯条
I'll have the burger with the fries.

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,428
把她的薯条换沙拉
She'll have it with the salad.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,515
可是我想吃薯条
But I want the fries.

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,185
你想吃是一回事  但吃了会胖不健康
Well, you want them,
but you don't need them.

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,689
好吧  那就换成沙拉
Fine. The salad.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,941
我要去洗手间
I have to pee.

9
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,278
-你好  你叫什么名字  -大卫
-Hi, what's your name?
-David.

10
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,405
大卫  你该滚了
David, you should go.

11
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,200
你什么意思
I'm sorry?

12
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,451
你想她吃沙拉  
You want her to have salad,

13
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:34,702
她想你有头发
she wants you to have hair.

14
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,704
今晚这两件事都不会发生
Neither one's gonna happen tonight.

15
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,417
你跟薯条妹不会有好结果的
Yeah, it's not gonna work out
between you and French fries.

16
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,752
或许能好个一周或一年
Oh, maybe it will
for a week or a year.

17
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,089
如果儿时受虐过  就能忍比较久
Depends if she was
molested as a kid.

18
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,299
但只要某天爆发了， 她肯定跟你玩命
But one of these days,
she's coming after you.

19
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,426
月黑风高夜  手里提着刀
Probably in the dark.
Probably with a knife.

20
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:54,305
手起刀落  砍掉你一两颗蛋蛋 
And she's gonna cut off
one or both of your balls.

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,557
到时你就不会介意她点薯条了
And you won't think
a side of fries matters

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,809
因为你已是没蛋[胆]人
when you have zero balls.

23
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,312
给她上薯条吧
She'll have the fries.

24
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,481
那是必须的
Yes, she will.

25
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,608
你看咱俩，守住了一个女人的尊严
Good for us.
We saved another woman's dignity

26
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,276
以及一个男人的蛋蛋
and another man's balls.

27
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,987
我们就像是更合格版的菲尔医生

Yeah, we're like Dr. Phil but more qualified.

我十分钟前就点了杯咖啡
I ordered a coffee ten minutes ago

你现在还没给我端来

Hey, man, I'm in the weeds here.

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,022
如果你有大麻  那咖啡就不要了
Well, if you've got weed,
cancel the coffee.

37

lazy-ass day waiter's job.

48

你可别赖我们
So don't blame us.

Hurry up. You two need to make coffee.

51

你也得去请新的上白班的员工

买台新的咖啡机如何
how about a brand-new coffeemaker?

买台没出现在爱德华·霍普画中的新机

我知道你想我买新咖啡机的原因
I know you only want me to get one

62
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,210
是因为方便你们小蛋糕窗口也能卖咖啡
so you can use it at your cupcake window.

63
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,502
你怎么能这么说
How dare you?

64

但如果你乐意的话那也行啊
Unless you're comfortable with that.

65
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,173
不  我说的是上白班的员工
No, I meant the new day waiter.

他就在厨房里. 去训练新人吧.
He's in the kitchen. Go train the new guy.

67

我们叫你炒掉的白班员工去哪了?
What happened to the guy we told you to fire?

68
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,929
我们很喜欢他呢.
We loved him.

69

好  我们现在就去训练新人.
Okay, we'll go train the new guy now.

但新的咖啡机,
But about that coffeemaker,

要不我们跟你一人出一半?
what if go halfsies with you?

我们出不了一半.

Did he say train the new guy or new gay?

79
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,832
你好  你一定是新的白班服务员.
Hi, you must be the new day waiter.

你们一定就是上晚班 要负责训练我的女孩们.
Ah, you must be the late girls who are supposed to train me.

是的  我叫路易斯.
Yes, I'm Luis.

82

他是说路易斯还是露易丝?
Did he say Luis or Louise?

83
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,800
我马上就好.
I'll be out in a minute.

I have to let this cream dry on my face.

Oh, I always wait for the cream to dry.

Oh, funny to mask the pain.

00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,208
-你也在"上"面吗  -废话.
-Are you a top?
-Oh, please.

134
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,837
价值两万五的脸蛋  哪能做"受"被压枕头上.
No one is pushing this 25,000 dollar face into a pillow.

135
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,467
我准备好点餐了.
Uh, I'm ready to order.

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,636
路易斯  你去搞定那桌吧
Luis, why don't you take that table?

137
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,554
这是你的训练  而且我也不想去.
It's part of your training, and I don't want to.

138
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,766
厄尔  他是上白班的新服务员.
Earl, that's the new day waiter.

139
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,809
他也是新的"基"务员.
He's also the new gay waiter.

140
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,061
我爱死男同们了.
Oh, I love the gays.

141
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,563
他们把我家那边一间老吸毒房.
They turned an old crack house

142
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,274
装修成了奶酪店
in my neighborhood into a cheese shop.

143
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,153
我听说那家奶酪店卖的毒品很不错呢.
I heard that cheese shop has really good crack.

144
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,406
今天的例汤是什么?
What's the soup of the day?

145
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,366
你没看见板子上怎么写的吗?
What does it say on the board?

146
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,619
你已经出师了.
And you're trained.

147
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,871
麦克斯  阿憨拒绝了,
Max, Han said no,

148
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,831
我们店里需要一台好咖啡机
and we need that cappuccino maker for our shop

149
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,709
不然我们怎么跟街角的星巴克
if we're ever gonna compete with the Starbucks around the corner.

150
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,754
以及另一个街角 还有另外个街角的店斗呢
Or the other corner.
Or the other corner.

151
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,465
还有正在我屁股上大兴土木的那家.
Or the one that's currently being built in my ass.

152
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,135
干嘛  我那也是黄金地段好吗.
What? It's prime real estate.

153
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,887
威廉斯堡地区已经没有任何空位了.
Everything else in Williamsburg is taken.

154
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,265
卡洛琳  你想要卡布奇诺咖啡机吗?
Caroline, you need a cappuccino machine?

155
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,434
我能帮你弄到便宜的.
I can get you one cheap.

156
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,435
 我认识个人.
I know a guy.

157
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,769
哪天需要干净尿液样本或迷你猪
And if you need clean urine

158
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,271
我也有认识的人.
or a micro pig, I also know that guy.

159
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,358
偶的天啊  他是谁？
Oh, my God.Who was that?

160
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,073
刚才是奥列格. 他是厨子.
Oh, that's... That's Oleg.He's the cook.

161
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,909
他真是太正点了.
He is gorgeous.

162
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,539
我好兴奋.
I'm so excited.

163
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,082
我们的新机器马上就要到了.
Our new machine will be here any minute.

164
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,876
我们的生活要飘出卡布奇诺香啦.
Our lives are about to get a lot more cappuccino-y.

165
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,296
或者说是卡布奇诺拿铁香
Or should I say a latte more cappuccino-y?

166
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,716
不  这些白痴话你就不应该说.
No, you should not say any of that.

167
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,010
至于奥列格说要给我们的"特别价",
And as for that "special price" Oleg said he'd give us,

168
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,681
先说好  玩3P,我得先上  以及不许亲吻.
in all my three-ways, I'm up to bat first, and I don't kiss.

169
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,602
白天这里面儿可真是热.
(GROANS) During the day, it is "Hot In Herre."

170
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,395
谢谢你的天气报告  亚瑟儿小子.
Ps:亚瑟小子  美国知名R&B流行歌手与演员
Thanks for the weather report, Ursher.

171
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,734
货到了.
Here it is.

172
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,527
关上窗子  然后闭嘴.
Shut the windows and shut up.

173
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,322
这开场白跟我想的一模一样啊.
Well, this is starting exactly like I imagined.

174
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,033
-快关上!    -奥列格  你去哪弄来的机器?
-Shut it!
-Oleg, where did you get this?

175
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,994
闭嘴!
Shut up!

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,288
-外面是警铃吗?  -闭嘴!
-Are those sirens?
-Shut up!

177
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,040
有使用说明书吗?
Does it come with instructions?

178
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,209
使用说明就是"闭上嘴".
The instructions are to shut up.

179
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,629
我们不要偷来的赃物.
We don't want it if it's stolen.

180
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,131
我现在还对不花钱把DVD自动租赁机的光盘
I still feel guilty about shaking down that Redbox

181
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,174
给弄出来而愧疚  但我本人绝对不知情.
for, I Don't Know How She Does It.

182
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,801
这不是我偷的.
I did not steal it.

183
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,928
我是在知情的情况下  跟偷它的人买了
I knowingly bought it from a man who stole it

184
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,930
然后再转手卖了获利.
and I'm selling it at a profit.

185
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,182
这是亚美尼亚人的方式.
It's the Armenian way.

186
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,601
你又不是亚美尼亚人.
You're not Armenian.

187
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:58,687
我知道  我只是说"这是亚美尼亚人"的方式.
I know, I'm just saying, it's the Armenian way.

188
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,149
这零售价是六百块,
It retails for $600,

189
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,777
但我愿意免费给你们,只要你们帮我做件事.
but I'll give it to you for free if you do me a favor.

190
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,236
免费吗?
Free?

191
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,532
好吧  那让麦克斯跟你去旁边的更衣间来一炮吧.
Ok, I guess Max can do you in that closet over there.

192
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,036
干嘛?我不能让到嘴的鸭子飞走呀.
What? Now that I see it,I have to have it.

193
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,623
好吧  养药千日  用在一时.
All right, I've been saving this pill for something.

194
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,918
去探探苏菲的口风. 看她有没有兴趣跟我复合.
Talk to Sophie. See if she wants to get back together.

195
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,920
但别告诉她我有这想法.
But don't tell her I'm interested.

196
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,046
低调行事 .
Do it discreetly.

197
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,466
行.奥列格  我好感动也有点惊讶啊.
Deal. And, Oleg, I'm touched and a little surprised.

198
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,595
我不知道你还懂"低调行事"这词.
I didn't know you knew the word "discreetly".

199
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,682
我床边有个每日一词日历
Oh, yeah. I have a word-a-day calendar near my bed

200
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,685
就在我那一大罐的凤梨味润滑剂旁.
next to my big pump jar of pineapple lube.

201
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,775
发浪肚饿都能挤一发.
For when you're horny and hungry.

202
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,571
麦克斯  你干嘛还吃?
Max, why'd you take it?

203
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,905
你又不用跟他来一炮.
You don't have to have sex with him.

204
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,282
我知道  我这是在庆祝.
I know, I'm celebrating.

205
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,664
我在网上找不到我们咖啡机的
Hey, I can't find any of the instructions on here

206
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,957
使用说明书啊.
for our coffeemaker.

207
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,625
也不怪它  我压根没找.
In fairness, I haven't been looking.

208
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,212
我被网上一个"刺青写错字"合集的帖子给吸引住了.
I got sidetracked by this Buzzfeed list of misspelled tattoos.

209
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,841
有个女孩刺脖子上次了"妹子烧烤[行啊].
This girl got, "You go grill" on her neck.

210
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,970
她一定是很喜欢在外面煮东西.
She must really like to cook outside.

211
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,599
你罚自己罚站面壁思过吗?
Did you put yourself in a time-out?

212
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,434
我在蹲点等苏菲.她不在楼上.
No, I'm looking for Sophie.She's not upstairs.

213
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,479
为了拿免费东西这代价也太大了.
Look, this is a long way to go to get something for free.

214
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,147
我很乐意去百货公司里
I was happy to walk into Sears

215
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,483
把咖啡机藏到我裤子里偷出来呢.
and stuff a cappuccino machine down my pants.

216
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,486
我不是为了免费拿咖啡机才这样.
I'm not doing it for the free cappuccino machine.

217
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,448
我是为了免费咖啡机能为我们赚到的钱  才这么大费周章.
I'm doing it for the money we'll make from the free cappuccino machine.

218
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,660
顺便帮奥列格与苏菲复合嘛.
And maybe to help Oleg and Sophie get back together.

219
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,162
就像莎士比亚书中的故事  我就是帕克.
Ps:帕克  出自莎士比亚的《仲夏夜之梦》书中的仙王仙后曾让小精灵帕克为有情人牵线
You know, it's a page out of Shakespeare, and I'm Puck.

220
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,331
《真实世界》里的帕克吗?
Ps:美国真人秀节目  帕克是在1994年的成员
Puck from The Real World?

221
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,127
我是唯一读过书的人吗?
Am I the only one who's read a book?

222
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,296
-她来了
-(FAINT THUDDING)
-(GASPS) Oh, here she is.

223
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,173
我来负责套话吧. 这方面算是我的强项.
I'll do the talking. It's kind of in my wheelhouse.

224
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,051
你有个房子,我们为啥要住在这垃圾堆里?
Ps:wheelhouse有强项或驾驶舱的意思直译也有房子的意思
You have a wheelhouse,and we're living in this dump?

225
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,804
-早安啊  苏菲 
-Morning, Sophie.
-Oh!

226
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,472
被你抓个正着.
(POLISH ACCENT) You caught me.

227
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,683
我现在是炮后羞愧地走回家.
I'm doing the walk of shame.

228
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,559
你们懂意思的吧
You know what that means, right?

229
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:05,022
我昨晚跟一个陌生人"大战"了一宿.
I was having sex all night with a stranger.

230
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,399
我也跟个男的床战一宿过.
I had sex with a guy all night once.

231
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,360
反正他是这么说的  我十点就睡着了.
At least that's what he said. I fell asleep at 10:00.

232
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:11,904
苏菲  进来吧.
Sophie, come in.

233
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,530
我们想问你一件要紧事.
We wanted to ask you something kind of important.

234
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,907
哦，好吧.
Oh, okay.

235
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,200
好吧  那我就说了.
Well, I'll tell you.

236
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,204
我觉得你的小蛋糕生意不会成功.
I don't think you're gonna make it in the cupcake business.

237
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,834
地铁站的灵媒跟你说的相反,但我会铭记在心的.
Not what the psychic in the subway told me, but duly noted.

238
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,170
其实是想问你个更私人的问题.
Actually, it's more of a personal question.

239
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,923
行  我个人认为
Oh, okay. Well, I personally

240
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,508
你的小蛋糕生意不会成功.
don't think you're gonna make it in the cupcake business.

241
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:37,595
-这问题跟奥列格有关.     -他也同意我这么说呢.
-No, the question is about Oleg.
-Oh, yeah, he agrees with me.

242
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,932
求你了  就直说吧  免得等会
God's sakes, just tell her before she tells us

243
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,934
她开始描述我们以后会躲在某个烂公寓
we're gonna wind up in some disgusting apartment

244
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,560
躲我们鸨母的未来.
hiding from our pimp.

245
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,104
好啦好啦  苏菲.
Okay, Okay, Sophie.

246
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,398
你有想过跟奥列格复合吗?
Do you ever think about getting back together with Oleg?

247
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,818
天啊  当然没有.
Oh, God, no.

248
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,946
我宁愿再发生次意外跟亲戚做爱的惨事呢.
I'd rather accidently have sex again with my cousin.

249
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,783
我可讨厌碰到这情况了.
I hate when that happens.

250
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,161
干嘛问
Why, did--

251
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,830
他问我的事了吗?
Did he ask about me?

252
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,331
没有啦  我就自己好奇.
Oh, no, no. I was just wondering.

253
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,874
他从来没提过你.
He never even mentions you.

254
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,087
那就好,因为姐已经不再留恋他了  宝贝.
Oh, good. 'Cause I moved on, baby.

255
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,298
惨了  惨了  我...
Oh, no. No, I...

256
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:17,510
我把我的塑身衣忘在斯塔顿岛了.
I left my Spanx on that Staten Island stoop.

257
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
是好的那套呢,
And they're the good ones,

258
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,263
 你懂吧,有尿洞的那种.
you know,with the pee hole in them.

259
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,809
我得去拿回来.好了  再见.
I gotta go grab 'em.All right. Bye-bye.

260
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,901
好了  我们已经把电源插上了,
Okay, good. Now we've got the power on,

261
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,778
但是要怎么蒸牛奶?
but how do we steam the milk?

262
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,529
也许是要按这触控板.
Maybe it's on this touchpad thing.

263
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,074
-我去你个亲娘七舅老爷!
-(STEAM HISSING)
-(SCREAMS) Holy Mother of God!

264
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,409
我的"小妹妹"被蒸熟了.
I just steamed my vagina.

265
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,831
麦克斯  卡洛琳  你们三分钟前就该上班了.
Max, Caroline, your shift started three minutes ago.

266
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:49,376
谁还在乎这份烂兼职?我可能这辈子都生不了小孩了.
Who cares about sidework? I probably can't have children.

267
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,004
她怎么了?
What is wrong with her?

268
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,714
她刚用蒸汽清洗了她的"地毯".
She just had her carpet steam-cleaned.

269
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,596
你们俩还没搞懂怎么用这台机器吗?
You two still haven't figured out this machine?

270
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,056
走开  我是亚洲男人.
Move away. I'm Asian and a man.

271
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,307
我对这种东西很在行.
I'm good with this kind of stuff.

272
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,018
阿憨  算了吧  这玩意挺危险的...
Well, Han, actually,it's pretty dangerous...

273
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,771
你最近没听说吗  人家阿憨是个"男人".
Hey, Han's a man,according to recent lore.

274
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,064
让他来拯救世界吧.
Let him save the day.

275
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,149
好吧  我看看 .
Okay, let's see.

276
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,609
这个按钮是蒸汽.这个按钮是...
Here's the steam one.And here's the button for...

277
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,237
-(STEAM HISSING)
-(SCREAMS)

278
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,990
我的脖子! 它烫伤了我的脖子!
My neck! It burned my neck!

279
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,575
那可是我最迷人的部位了.
And that was my best feature.

280
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,411
还好你不够高.
Luckily you're not taller.

281
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,079
不然你烫伤的就是阴道啦.
You would've burned your vagina.

282
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,083
那台卡布奇诺咖啡机刚可能
That cappuccino machine

283
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,752
给我做了个"大杯"级子宫切除术.
might have just given me a grande hysterectomy.

284
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,964
卡洛琳  我知道现在时机可能不好.
Caroline, I know this might not be a good time.

285
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,508
卡洛琳  我知道现在时机可能不好.
I heard about your recent clambake.

286
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,516
但我想知道苏菲怎么说?
But what did Sophie say?

287
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,144
抱歉  奥列格  苏菲对你已不再留恋.
I'm sorry, Oleg.Sophie's moved on.

288
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,478
她现在跟其他男人约会.
She's seeing other men.

289
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,980
对  但不是在你的那一区.
Yeah, but not in your neighborhood.

290
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:52,981
她很会"做".
She's classy.

291
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,859
她很尊重地跑到斯塔顿岛的一个小门廊"做".
She had the decency to do it on a stoop in Staten Island.

292
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,904
她居然没叫上我  自己去那个岛?
She went to the Island without me?

293
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,365
她居然没叫上我  自己去那个岛.
Ps:斯塔顿岛是美国纽约湾对面的岛屿
We were going to travel the world together.

294
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:05,828
奥列格？
Oleg?

295
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,162
奥列格  你是在哭吗?
Oleg, are you crying?

296
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,707
不  我只是鼻屎太多堵得慌.
No, I have a booger situation.

297
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,920
此话出自我们餐厅大厨之口.
Says the man who cooks the food.

298
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,092
那里面是什么地方?
Hey, what's this area back there?

299
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,927
那是我们的衣橱  怎么了?
Uh, it's our closet, why?

300
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,678
我应该进去看看.
I should check it out.

301
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,807
我一直在找地方能让我带不是苏菲的女人去做爱.
I'm always looking for places to have sex with women who are not Sophie.

302
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,351
(SOBBING)

303
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,813
奥列格在这里吗?我闻到他的体香了.
Is Oleg in here? I thought I smelled him.

304
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,234
男人味和奶油混合在一起的香味.
That delicious mix of man and butter.

305
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,363
奥列格在"柜里"呢.
Oleg's in the closet.

306
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,907
亲爱的  你不说我也知道.
Oh, honey, I could've told you that.

307
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,786
路易斯  奥列格真的是直男.
Really, Luis, Oleg is straight.

308
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:49,955
等我下菜单的时候
Wait 'til you see what happens

309
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,499
要一份"硬骨"肋眼牛排  你就知道了.
when I place an order for a bone-in rib eye.

310
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,418
真的  他几乎每天露鸟都给我们看...
It's true. He shows us his penis every...

311
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,214
底线啊  姑娘们  底线.
Ah-ah-ah, boundaries, girls,boundaries.

312
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,925
那他那只是神雕吗?
So is it a nice one?

313
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,429
他的"雕兄"有次还帮我开门了呢.
Well, it did open a door for me once.

314
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,059
路易斯  或许你能帮我们个忙.
Hey Luis,maybe you can help us.

315
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,310
你是个生活家,你肯定知道这咖啡机
Since you're a lifer, you have to know how to

316
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,562
-要怎么操作.   -不  不可能  我是为餐厅工作.
-work this thing.
-No, no, no, I work for a diner.

317
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,940
又不是为你俩工作.别把我牵扯进你们的事里.
I don't work for you. Don't bring me into your drama.

318
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,567
♪ (CELL PHONE RINGTONE PLAYS) ♪

319
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,695
我得接下电话.是我妈  她在守灵.
Oh, I have to get this. It's my mother. She's on death watch.

320
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,448
但我在星巴克工作时用的咖啡机跟这台一样.
But we used to have the same machine when I worked at Starbucks.

321
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,492
妈咪  你还好吗[西语]
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

322
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,829
不  我才不去星巴克打工.
No, I am not working at Starbucks.

323
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,124
我没想要这么说呀.
That's not what I was gonna say.

324
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,626
只是去打两小时工而已嘛.
Just for two hours.

325
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,129
等我们学会怎么用之后就可以不干了.
We can quit after we learn how to work this damn machine.

326
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,964
老娘从不说撤就撤.
Hey, I am not a quitter.

327
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,175
老娘只能是被炒  这是我的强项.
I get fired.That's my wheelhouse.

328
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,263
真不敢相信这么快工作就到手了.
I can't believe we got hired so quickly.

329
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,433
我也不敢相信我居然得穿中号的围裙.
And I can't believe I'm a medium apron.

330
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,811
我也不敢相信我在一家连锁恶霸企业咖啡店上班.
And I can't believe I'm working for a corporate coffee place.

331
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,563
这或许是我人生的最低点,
This might be the lowest point of my life,

332
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,358
我妈有次在赌场后面玩垃圾游戏把我弄丢  我都没这么低落.
and my mom once lost me in a craps game behind a casino.

333
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,903
你好  我们是来受训的新员工.
Hi, we're here to be trained.

334
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,698
我知道  真是太不幸了.
I know.That's unfortunate.

335
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,451
-我叫德文.   -那才叫不幸呢.
-My name's Devon.
-Well, that's unfortunate.

336
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,703
咱们赶紧开始吧.
Let's get this over with.

337
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,746
我还有很多地方得去呢.
I have a lot of other places I need to be.

338
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,165
比如你住的老妈家地下室吗?
Like your mom's basement?

339
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,792
你没必要在这给我甩脸色.
Hey, you don't have to give me attitude.

340
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,087
我是没必要  但我爽这样做.
I don't have to, but it's my pleasure.

341
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,214
抱歉  德文  她可能有点难以接受
Sorry, Devon,It's just that it's hard for her

342
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,881
因为你的名字叫德文.
Ps:这个名字跟很多负面的刻板印象有关联废话多的傻逼  欲女  变态等等
'cause your name is Devon.

343
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,343
你们俩到底是什么  俩作家吗?
So what are you girls? Writers?

344
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,928
民谣二重唱  还是俩贱人?
Folk duo? Just bitches?

345
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,931
说对了  废柴.
Nailed it, loser.

346
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,266
麦克斯  别咄咄逼人了.
Max, pace yourself.

347
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,393
我们只需再忍1个小时50分钟就好.
We need this job for another hour and 50 minutes.

348
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,479
好吧  说正事  我得在这工作多久
Okay, but for real,how long do you gotta work here

349
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,896
才享有医保待遇?
before the health insurance kicks in?

350
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:39,814
包括牙医吗?
And is there dental?

351
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,109
因为我里面有一颗没用的烂牙.
'Cause I got a dead tooth doing nothing for me.

352
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,861
工作30天之后才享有医保.
The insurance kicks in after 30 days.

353
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,863
这是工会提供的  不是廉价的那种医保.
But it's a PPO, not an HMO.

354
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,698
我们另一份工作里已经有一位基佬了.
Ps:HMO医保与Homo同性恋相似
Oh, we just got an HMO at our other job.

355
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,325
他是夏绿蒂那型的.
He's a Charlotte.

356
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,619
好吧  开始了.
Okay, here we go.

357
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,038
我们做什么咖啡都要用到这台机子.
Look, this is the machine we use for everything.

358
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,290
操作非常容易除非你是笨蛋,
It's incredibly easy to work unless you're stupid,

359
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,666
如果是的话  请趁早告诉我.
in which case, tell me now.

360
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,543
德文  我们不是你恶毒的继父.
Devon, we're not your mean stepdad.

361
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,088
快教我们如何操作这台机子吧.
Just show us how to use the machine.

362
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,841
听好了.先从热水流出来的口把过滤斗拿出来.
Listen up. Unlatch the portafilter from the group head.

363
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,551
按这里弄出一盎司的咖啡粉.
Press here for an ounce of grounds.

364
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,637
再塞进去  压实  打开按钮.
Tamp it in, pack it down, turn it on.

365
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,222
我没听明白  你呢?
I didn't get that, did you?

366
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,766
老实说  我只听见流水的头.
Honestly, all I heard was "group head".

367
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,768
反正就是塞进去  压实  扭把手,
So you tamp, pack,turn the knob,

368
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,021
等3秒  水烧开需30秒 然后把咖啡倒出来.
wait three, blast for 30,then you pour the shot.

369
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,688
 把蒸汽棒倾斜45度角
Place the steam wand halfway in the pitcher

370
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,775
插进奶缸一半处  把牛奶热到103度为止.
at a 45-degree angle until the milk is 103 degrees.

371
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,653
你是想说做制作冰毒比制作咖啡简单多了吗?
So what you're saying is it's easier to make meth?

372
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,448
糖浆  咖啡粉  生奶油都在这里.
Syrups, powders,whipped cream is right here.

373
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,699
你们俩有用过这玩意吗?
You ever work with one of these?

374
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,618
我觉得应该不难  我是华顿商学院毕业的.
I think I can handle it.I went to Wharton.

375
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,953
,-我还是哈佛毕业的呢   -我是少教所毕业的
-Well, I went to Harvard.
-And I went to juvie.

376
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,581
而结果我们仨都穿着围裙在这里打工.
And we're all here wearing an apron.

377
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,295
大杯双份无脂卡布奇诺.
A grande double cap, non-fat.

378
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,004
大杯双份  无脂卡布奇诺.
Grande double cap, non-fat.

379
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,340
喵喵  喵喵喵
(MEOWING NONSENSICALLY)

380
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,509
超大杯三份卡布奇诺  不加鲜奶油.
A venti triple cap, no whip.

381
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,094
超大杯三份卡布奇诺  不加鲜奶油.
Venti triple cap, no whip.

382
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,180
,喵喵  喵喵喵
(CONTINUES MEOWING)

383
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,848
大杯双份豆奶拿铁.
Grande double soy latte.

384
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,725
大杯双份豆奶拿铁 -收到了吗  麦克斯 
Grande double soy latte.Got it, Max?

385
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,018
-没有.
-Nope.

386
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,856
-,咖啡好了吗  麦克斯    -正在做  快好了.
-Where's those drinks, Max?
-Working on it, getting close.

387
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,570
结果全"喷"到自己身上了.
And I finished all over myself.

388
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,988
果然是我的风格.
That's so me.

389
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,907
拜托  麦克斯  没这么难吧.
Come on, Max,it can't be that hard.

390
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,785
你们俩  换一换.我得多拿点纸巾出去.
You two, switch.I gotta put out more napkins.

391
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,620
那个女人分手互助协会来了,
That women's breakup support group is here,

392
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,372
她们会用光咱们的纸巾.
and they tap us out.

393
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,582
你以为她们现在就在哭吗?
Think they're crying now?

394
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,875
等没了蛋糕棒棒糖  你再听听.
Just wait 'til we run out of cake pops.

395
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,796
我要中杯卡布奇诺  三份浓缩  半低咖啡因.
I'll have a tall cap, triple-shot half caf.

396
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,341
小渣渣  打奶头 半半.
Small scrap nipple slap half-half.

397
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,053
这不是我的原话.
That's not what I said.

398
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,930
中杯卡布奇诺  三份浓缩  半低咖啡因吗?
Tall cap triple-shot half caf?

399
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,850
姑娘  你还真行. 你真适合在星巴克工作.
Girl, you're good at this.You should work at Starbucks.

400
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,436
我是很厉害  我觉得我会操作这台机子了.
I am good.I think I'm getting the hang of this.

401
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,605
-现在我得先
-Now I just have to-- (SCREAMS)
-(STEAM HISSING)

402
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,107
我擦咧  疼死老娘了!
Holy Mother of... Ouch!

403
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,735
这台咖啡机一定是仇视女性.我们应该管它叫"德州"
Ps:因为德州通过了一系列歧视女人的法案
This thing hates women so much,we should call it Texas.

404
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,700
或是俄亥俄州.
Ps:俄亥俄州有不允许怀孕20周以上妇女堕胎的法令
Or Ohio.

405
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,286
或者老实说  美国大部分地区都这样.
Or, to be honest,most of America.

406
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,331
我要一杯热腾腾的中杯滴滤咖啡.
I'll have a tall drip, extra hot.

407
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,542
-请问你您贵姓     -格雷格  木字旁的格.
-Uh, what's your name?
-Gregg, with three "g"'s.

408
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,337
好的  我就画一个鸡鸡的图案好了.
Yeah, you're gonna be this picture of a penis.

409
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,843
你也太没礼貌了.
That's rude.

410
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,970
现在我再送它顶帽子.
Now it has a hat on it.

411
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,724
它在跟你说"你好".
It's saying, "good day."

412
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,518
你想让我去找你们的经理谈谈吗?
Do you want me to talk to your manager?

413
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,811
没错  再等20分钟,等她学会怎么用这台咖啡机再去.
Yeah, in about 20 minutes,after she learns this machine.

414
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,857
你好.
Hi.

And a gingerbread latte with 11 Splendas.

418
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,413
你们俩能给我解释一下这个吗?
Can you two explain what this is?

419
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,916
-这不是显而易见的吗.  -那是一个带着帽子的鸡鸡.
-I'd say it's pretty obvious.
-That's a penis wearing a hat.

420
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,043
为什么?
Why?

421
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,087
因为它秃头没安全感啊.
Because it's bald and a little insecure.

422
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,551
-好吧  你们俩被解雇了  -拜托  德文.
-Dudes, you're, like, fired.
-Come on, Devon.

423
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,928
再给我20分钟学习怎么用这台机子.
We just need 20 more minutes to learn that machine.

424
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,555
-拜托了    -不行
-Please?
-No.

425
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,723
把你们的围裙和帽子摘下交回.
Return your aprons and caps.

426
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,561
还有不要想着把三明治装到口袋里带走.
And do not even think about putting sandwiches in your pockets.

427
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,062
太没天理了?
What?

428
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,565
辛苦"做"了那么久  连个面包都不给拿吗?
A girl can't get a morning bun?

429
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,733
不行  绝对不行.
No and no.

430
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,570
还有把你们做的这杯"屎不奇诺"带走.
And take this crappuccino you made with you.

431
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,033
的确  味道不太对.
Oh, yeah, that is not quite right.

432
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,786
我的烂牙都开始疼了.
And it hit my dead tooth.

433
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,919
-你牛奶弄得怎么样  -很好
-How you doing with that milk?
-Great.

434
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,464
我打出来的奶泡比用尼克·卡农的舌头还厉害.
Ps:著名的饶舌歌手
Mine's more whipped than Nick Cannon.

435
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,758
你们好呀  姑娘们.你们的新咖啡机用得怎么样了?
Hola, chicas. How's it going with your new machine?

436

就问问  完全没有关心成分.
Not that I care or am invested at all.

You don't even know if you're coming or not?

果然是你的风格.
That's so you.

440
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,438
你们有见到奥列格吗?
Have you seen Oleg?

441
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,065
从他出[了衣]柜之后  就再也没见过他了.
No, not since he came out of the closet.

442
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,319
-你找他干嘛?   -关你什么事?
-Why are you looking for him?
-How is this your business?

443
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,946
因为你问我  "有没有见过奥列格"?
Because you said,"Have you seen Oleg?"

444
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,157
对哦.瞧瞧你.
You got me.Look at you.

445
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,952
嘴巴那么毒  内心一定有很多苦吧.
So much spice, so much pain.

446
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,912
被你发现了.
You got me.

很多基佬都会这样.
Oh, it happens to a lot of gays.

457
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,316
一旦出柜  他们就会恐慌,然后又躲进去.
They come out, they freak out,they go back in.

458
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,984
但我看到了他的心.
But I see him.
