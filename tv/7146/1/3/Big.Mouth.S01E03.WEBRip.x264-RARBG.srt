No. Guys, nobody dumped anyone.
We're still going out. We're just friends.

to preemptively let you know

-that I'm not interested in you.
-And may I say that I fully understand

-and I thank you for your candor.
-You're welcome.

139
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,922
That. That, too. You're weirdly formal,

who's in the Air Force

and you have a condo,

in the building.

if you're asking, you're probably gay.

What does that even mean?

who broke up with who,

and here to give us the inside scoop
is Nick.

155
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:50,970
Nick, tell us, in your own tiny words,
who dumped who?

156
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,599
[chuckles]  First of all,
I really don't like the word "dump."

157
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,394
I find it offensive. I mean, does
it really matter who broke up with who?

158
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,689
-Of course it does. You know that.
-Okay, here's what I will say--

159
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,400
I think Jessi is a fantastic girl,

160
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,821
and that's why it was so hard
for  me  to break up with  her.

00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,701
- Nick dumped Jessi.
-[growls]

163
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,287
Angry.

164
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:22,126
We shall reach up that little pygmy's ass
and pull out his heart!

165
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,879
-[thunderclap crashes]
-His ass heart!

166
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,883
Tomorrow, an exclusive interview
with Patient Zero in our pinkeye epidemic.

167
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:33,846
Yeah, looking back, there was definitely
fecal matter on some of the basketballs.

168
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,142
This is Coach Steve, by the way.
Ooh, I can't believe I'm gonna be on TV!

169
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,560
[faint barking]

170
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,020
[whistling]

171
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:45,358
Okay, so, normally right about now
I'd watch the Mets game.

172
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,487
But if I'm probably gay,
maybe I should--

173
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,948
Definitely watch gay porn.

174
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,617
I know, I know, but I've been scared
to look at  any  porn.

175
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,037
Isn't going directly to gay porn
like jumping head first into the deep end?

176
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,040
More like dick first into the butt end.
Nailed it.

177
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,124
[clicking]

178
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,336
Don't just type in "gay porn."
Switch over to private browsing first.

179
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,420
Good call, good call.

180
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,674
We're gonna have to clear more cookies
than a fat kid at a birthday party.

181
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,467
[laughs]
Nailed it again.

182
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,385

-Um...

183
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,471
All right, Andrew, this is your journey.
You must be your own shaman.

184
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,639
Ugh...

185
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,891
-Click the mouse.
-Okay. Here goes.

186
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,394
-[clicks]
-[siren wails]

187
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,938
-Well, all right.
-Shit. Wait. What's this?

188
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,231
-That's good.
-Wait. Close that.

189
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,149
-That won't close. Why won't this close?
-[Hormone Monster] Open that one.

190
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,986
-No, I don't want to zoom.
-Yes! Yes!

191
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,862
-[Andrew] Stop clicking on it!
-It's got a life of its own!

192
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,575
Virus, virus! Shame on you!

193
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,411
-[Dad] Andrew, what's going on up there?
-Nothing! I'm asleep.

194
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,581
[Dad]
Well, something's wrong with the computer.

195
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,542
Terry Bradshaw's taking a shower
with Howie Long,

196
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,211
and why does Shannon Sharpe
want to get in there?

197
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh, my God!
[thumps]

198
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,715
[bell rings]

199
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,634
Ooh, how'd you break up with Jessi?
Did you make her cry?

200
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,554
To be honest, it was, like,
the hardest thing I've ever had to do

201
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,515
but it was the right thing to do.
Does that make sense?

202
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,059
-Ha! You my dawg.
-Nick Birch!

203
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,400
Looks like I picked the right outfit
this morning.

204
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,486
Jessi, it's-- ahem, good to see you.

205
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,280
-Is it?
-What's going on?

206
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,407
I can't see. My eyes are crusted shut.

207
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,576
Look, we could still be friends.

208
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,412
Friends? Ha!

209
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,581
Oh, we're  not  friends.

210
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,833
Cut that little pipsqueak down to size.

211
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,629
And to set the record straight,
I  broke up with  you.

212
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,797
-Well, it was mutual.
-No, no, no.

213
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,300
-Gun him down.
-I knew it wasn't gonna work

214
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:38,387
as soon as I kissed
your big, weird catfish mouth.

215
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,765
-[all gasp]
-Yeah, paint a picture, baby.

216
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,351
Jessi, let's not forget  you  kissed  me.

217
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,103
-Oh, I'll never forget.
-Sing it, sister.

218
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,897
Just with your giant blubbery lips

219
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,524
it felt like I was chewing
on two lukewarm hot dogs.

220
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,485
-Okay.
-More, more, more!

221
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,739
The gross poking and prodding
from your scaly alligator tongue.

222
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,658
Rub his nose in it.

223
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:03,996
And I  pity  the poor girl who makes
the mistake of kissing you next.

224
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,749
You're gonna hear that from time to time.
It's part of the game.

225
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,751
But that's not gonna happen.

226
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,630
'Cause I'm gonna tell everyone
that you, Nick Birch,

227
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,133
[screams]
are the world's  worst  kisser!

228
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,343
[all gasp]

229
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,347
Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker.

230
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,099
Now let's mosey.

231
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,354
Aw, don't worry about it, Nick.
Opinions are like assholes--

232
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,023
keep 'em away
from your basketballs, all right?

233
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,024
[distant dog barking]

234
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,235
Okay, okay, you gotta get back at Jessi.

235
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,112
-Jay.
-And I've got just the idea.

236
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,905
-Jay--
-It's a little bit juvenile,

237
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,990
but it's simple and it's timeless.

238
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,243
-Jay--
-We let it be known that Jessi,

239
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:47,623
-for a snack, eats tiny pieces of shit.
-What? She doesn't eat pieces of shit.

240
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,042
Andrew, you're picturing it
and we're talking about it.

241
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,585
-That's a win in my book.
-Wait, wait, wait.

242
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,213
I'm not gonna say that Jessi eats shit.

243
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,049
We're in a fight but ultimately
we're still friends, right?

244
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,469
No! She  was  your friend,
then she was your lover,

245
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,263
now she's your enemy.

246
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,974
Please stop quoting your dad's
divorce lawyer commercials.

247
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,018
Okay, fine. We'll take the high road.
We'll just say she's a lesbo.

248
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,021
No, if I call her a lesbo,
then she's gonna say that I'm gay.

249
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,983
And, hey, is--
that's a bad thing, right?

250
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,734
Like if people think you're gay
that's bad?

251
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,320
-No, we all know it's okay to be gay.
-Do we?

252
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,699
I mean, if it's so "okay" to be gay,

253
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,701
then why are you so afraid
to be called gay?

254
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,411
-Because I'm not.
-But if you were--

255
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,704
-It'd be a nightmare.
-Why?

256
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,330
Why? Come on, Andrew.

257
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,374
No girl's gonna hook up with you
if you're gay.

258
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,043
They'll think all you do is stick
your dick inside other dudes' dicks.

259
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,338
Jay, gay people don't stick their dicks
inside other dicks.

260
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,882
You're picturing it
and we're talking about it.

261
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,009
-I'm not picturing that.
-Let me ask you this--

262
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,970
would you rather that lesbo
call you "catfish mouth" or gay?

263
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,346
I don't want to be called either.

264
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,891
Because being gay is as bad
as having a catfish mouth.

265
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,100
We're all on the same page.

266
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,394
-What's so bad about being gay?
-Nothing.

267
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,605
It just seems kinda hard to be gay.

268
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,191
Oh, it's really hard. I mean,
have you ever looked at gay porn?

269
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,027
-What? No.
-Neither have I, right? Okay.

270
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,321
Now if you'll excuse me, bathroom.

271
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,492
Okay, okay, how about this-- we'll say
Jessi puts peanut butter on her dog's dick

272
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,076
and licks it off. Yum, yum, yum.

273
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,537
Aren't you supposed to put
the peanut butter on your  own  dick?

274
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,415
Oh. Wow. That would feel way better.

275
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,545
Um, hello? Mr. Ghost of Duke Ellington?
It's Andrew.

276
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,632
Why, hello, Andrew!
[laughs]

277
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,759
Are you doing a report on me for school?

278
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:26,180
Here's a fun fact-- Stevie Wonder
wrote the song "Sir Duke" about  me.

279
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,266
And he's been faking his blindness
his entire life.

280
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,186
That sounds like
a crazy conspiracy theory.

281
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,855
[laughing]
You should hear my views on 9/11.

282
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,400
How come all the Jews knew
not to come to work that day?

283
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
No, that's been proven to be untrue.

284
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,365
You're picturing it
and we're talking about it. [laughs]

285
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,869
Anyway, Duke, I wanted your advice,
and I guess I still do.

286
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:53,123
You see, Duke, I'm probably gay
and it is scary.

287
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,836
Only if you find disposable income
and terrific summer houses scary.

288
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,837
[laughing]

289
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,131
Did you know any gay people
when you were alive?

290
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,426
Of course! I was in show business,

291
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,804
the official profession of the gay people.

292
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:12,017
Allow me to introduce you
to famous deceased homosexuals

293
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,687
Socrates, Freddie Mercury,

294
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,482
and Justice Antonin Scalia.

295
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,943
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia?

296
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,987
But weren't you famously anti-gay?

297
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,366
I was deep in the closet,
and I wish I came out while I was alive.

298
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,371
Ghost cock is like vegan bacon--
it just isn't as good as the real thing.

299
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,999
-And it has a weird texture.
-Wow, yeah.

300
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,210
Also, it's the best time to be gay
since ancient Greece.

301
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,879
Huh. I had no idea.

302
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,797
As long as you live on one of the coasts,

303
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,134
or Austin, Texas--
that place is keeping it weird.

304
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,344
Being gay can be bloody brilliant.

305
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,306
-How so, Freddie Mercury?
-I was hoping you would ask.

Matthew, you were right. I'm gay.

331
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,233
Well, look at you,
walking into rooms, declaring things.

332
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,902
Yes, I'm declaring
that I'm a proud gay man.

333
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,488
Okay, what's next?
How am I supposed to dress?

334
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,074
How do I meet other gay people?
How do I find a boyfriend?

335
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,868
Well, first of all,
you already  have  a boyfriend.

336
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,620
-What? Who?
-"Peanut."

337
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,038
-Who?
-"Little Purse Dog."

338
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,916
-Purse Dog?
-"Mr. Teddy Graham."

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,669
-Nick?
-Yes! "Little Baby Salt Shaker."

340
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,588
What? No, Nick's not my boyfriend.
We're just best friends.

341
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,966
Oh, please!
You do everything together.

342
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,344
You're always making each other jealous,
getting in your stupid little fights.

343
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,848
-It's classic. You're a tall and a short.
-Is that a thing?

344
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,392
Everything in the gay community
is a thing.

345
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,894
Also, bye-ee!

346
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,692
He's right, it's Nick.
It's always been Nick.

347
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,569
So what's up?
You officially gay?

348
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,238
What? Yes. Where have you been?

349
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,783
I'm sorry, I was inducting
my dear friend Joe Walsh

350
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,827
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

351
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,123
And as long as he's around,
rock and roll will never die.

352
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:26,253
Ladies and gentlemen, Eagles legend
and my brother-in-arms, Mr. Joe--

353
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,463
Well, you get it.

354
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,383
Is this the gay kid
you were talking about, man?

355
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,385
Yeah. He thinks he's in love
with his best friend.

356
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,556
It would be kind of perfect, right?
We get along, his parents love me--

357
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,727
Well, if he's gay and into it,
then you're making music.

358
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,064
Beautiful music. Though,
I should figure out if Nick is into it.

359
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,025
But if he's not,
that's a hard morning light

360
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,402
coming through your window, brother.

361
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,155
Joe Walsh is right.
If I come right out and tell him

362
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,574
and he's not into it,
that could ruin everything.

363
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,744
Yeah, and then you'll get caught up
in a bunch of lawsuits

364
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,621
about publishing rights,

365
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,875
and Don Henley doesn't call you
on your birthday anymore, man.

366
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,669
It's a bummer
'cause he was your brother.

368
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,013
-What's up, jerk?
-Hey, Jessi,

369
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,184
-do you want to sit over here with me?
-Oh, yeah. Thanks, Missy.

370
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,061
Do you want some of
my homemade fruit leather?

371
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,856
-I'm not allowed refined sugar.
-Uh, thanks. I'm all set.

372
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,274
Oh. Okay, how about this?

373
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,319
Wow. It must be hard for you
that you can't sit with the boys anymore

374
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,031
after all that stuff you said
about Nick's mouth.

375
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,201
-Yeah.
-The gloves came off in a fit of rage.

376
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,161
I was really mad.

377
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,414
And I guess as goes Nick
so goes Andrew.

378
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,084
It's the law of the jungle, Jessi.
It's the law of the jungle.

379
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,795
Yeah, that part
I didn't really think through.

380
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,050
Fucking bitch!

381
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,886
when you know she wants to be eating
little pieces of shit.

382
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,597
Jay, please.
How did everything get so messed up?

383
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,684
I know. This whole thing with Jessi,
it makes you wonder,

384
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,978
like, hey, women, do we even need them?

385
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,690
What? Of course we do.
What about my mom and, like, whores?

386
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,152
My point is, when it's just the boys
it's, hey, we make music.

387
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,611
-Uh-huh.
-But with girls it's like,

388
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,864
-"Aw, why aren't they boys?"
-I don't get it.

389
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,657
Are you saying
that we can't be friends with girls?

390
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,703
No, I'm just saying maybe the two of us
should go on a vacation,

391
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,455
go camping or something,
get away from all this woman drama.

392
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,792
-Oh, I love that. Camping's a great--
-It's just Nick and me!

393
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,128
Oh-- yeah, no, that-- that's fine.

394
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,630
I mean, I know how to track you guys.

395

-[music playing]
-Nick-o-teen,

396
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,768
you caught me working on a new song
that no one will ever hear.

397
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,145
[laughing]

398
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:52,024
Oh, death is so profoundly sad.

399
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,443
But enough about me.
Why the long face?

400
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,362
Duke, I guess I was wondering,
have you ever stayed friends with an ex?

401
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,865
-Nope. Impossible.
-That's a bummer.

402
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,700
I'd really like to be friends
with Jessi again.

403
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,120
Man, you boys
having a lot of problems this week, huh?

404
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,955
-What do you mean?
-Your lumpy friend Andrew

405
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,457
was up here the other day.

406
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,210
Good kid.
Thinks he might be a homosexual.

407
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,503
What? Andrew? That's impossible.

408
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,422
-He would tell me.
-Would he?

409
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,091
What if he's shaking
in his little gay boots,

410
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,385
scared you won't want to be
his friend anymore?

411
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,305
I don't care if Andrew's gay,
I'll always want to be his friend.

412
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,559
Let's just say he comes out to you
and you fire him from your band,

413
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,813
so he becomes destitute and
flings himself in front of a trolley car.

414
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,483
Duke, did you fire a guy for being gay?

415
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,820
Oh, God, no! I loved having
gay guys in my band.

416
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,406
More groupie for Dukie.
Yum, yum, yum!

417
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,742
I would never fire Andrew from my band.

418
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,494
Oh, my God, poor Andrew.

419
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,248
"Oh, my God, poor Andrew"?
That sounds like a good song.

420
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,792
I'm gonna change the "oh, my God"
to "hey, now"

421
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,962

-What are you doing here?
-I spoke to Duke.

425
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,476
Oh. Did he mention anything
about Stevie Wonder

426
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,356
-and his connection to 9/11?
-No. We actually talked about you.

Like, a big, hard boner.
And I don't know how to talk to girls

432
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,334
but I wanna jizz all the time,

433
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,838
and I'm so awkward around everyone
except you, 'cause we're best friends,

434
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,924

like being gay might actually be great.

But now that I'm saying it out loud
I don't know.

436
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,888
I wish there was some way to know.
I've never even kissed a guy.

437
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,599
I've never kissed anyone, for that matter.
How am I supposed to know if--

438
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,569
You just kissed me.

439
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,405
It was scientific.
I was just trying to help.

440
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,823
Did you feel anything?

-Uh...
-Nothing, flaccid.

442
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,619

jam it in his mouth,

-just the sheer fucking degradation--
-Wait, wait, wait. Hush.

Honestly, I didn't like it.

448
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,553
Is it because
I have a gross catfish mouth?

449
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:31,058
No, no, no, your mouth is fine.
I just didn't feel anything.

with you.

482
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,019
And we sucked
at being boyfriend and girlfriend.

483
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,314
-Totally sucked at it.
-Are you sure we're not at Walgreens?

484
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,109
I need to find the bin
filled with plastic balls

485
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,610
that are too light to throw.

486
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,530
I'm really sorry I said
all those terrible things about you.

487
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,241
It's my fault.
I lied about how we broke up.

488
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,493
I guess I just didn't want
to seem like the loser.

489
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,495
We were both kind of losers.

490
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,955
Yeah, we were.

491
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,415
Shall we go to the movie?

492
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,418
-After you, milady.
-Thank you, good sir.

493
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:28,758
Aw, Atlanta Claus, you gotta help me find
a dying Mylar balloon that says "Wow."

494
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,719
Merry Christ-murs!

495
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,513
Have you been nar-ghty or nice?

496
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,057
I can't be dishonest with you,
Black Santa.

497
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,475
I've been real nar-ghty.

498
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,770
I'm the one who put the fecal matter
on the basketballs.

499
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,273
Hallelujer!

500
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:48,278
Hey, Matthew, I just want to let you know
that I-- I figured it out.

501
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,447
-I'm not gay.
-Oh!

502
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,991
You had a whole little journey,
didn't you?

503
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,287
Well, guess what, sack of potatoes?
No one is 100-percent gay or straight.

504
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,457
-It's a spectrum.
-Oh. Well, how gay are you?

505
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,293
I'm 20/20. Didn't Morrey
give you the gay test?

506
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,879
"Morrey"? Do you mean
the Hormone Monster?

507
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,924
Yeah, Morrey. He's the fucking man.

508
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,884
And he's only a monster
when he does coke.

509
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,761
Wow. Hmm. Well, that's--

510
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,097
anyway, I guess I should be in less
of a hurry to figure everything out

511
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,266
and just take each boner as it comes.

512
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,976
[laughs] You're precious.

513
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,104
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go watch  "PB:NYC,"

514
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,858
which looks... super gay.

515
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,235
Bye-ee!

517
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,489
What in the what?
Where do we go now, Paul Bunyan?

518
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,158
We're going to the Brambles
in Central Park.

520
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,954
Wait, what? Please tell me
there's a Walgreens

521
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,122
in the gay part of Central Park.

522
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,126
I really need a DVD of "Van Helsing"
and a six-foot-long receipt.

523
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,044

-Agh!

526
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,802
Please tell me they put a Walgreens
in this Netflix.

527
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,221
What are you guys gonna watch next?
Do you wanna hang out?

528
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,473
You guys gonna watch another episode?
