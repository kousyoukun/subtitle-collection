1
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:12,178
[spectators] Blood, blood, blood!

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,014
Hit him, you pussy!

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,433
No blood, no porn!

4
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,019
Rip his face off!

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,896
You motherfucker!

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,904
Gentlemen, tonight is gonna be
the ultimate sleepover--

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,699
no parents, no rules, no shirts,

8
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,035
and best of all,
"Hooker Killer: Vatican City."

9
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,038
-What's that now?
-I've read about this game.

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,122
I can't believe you got it.

11
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,625
It's rated "CSMBP,"
for "Child Services Must Be Present."

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,462
Yeah. I had to show the guy at GameStop
my dick just to get it.

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,588
-Worth it.
-Oh, Jay.

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,758
So I know your parents
aren't going to be home,

15
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,010
but what about your brothers?

16
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,096
Those guys are manimals. They stabbed
their aunt in the fucking leg.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,099
Val and Curt? They're out all night.

18
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:03,313
Good. It'll be three almost-teenage boys
and a violent sexual video game.

19
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,900
-I guess that could be fun.
-Oh, Andrew, my sweet boy,

20
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,486
it's going to be the greatest night
of our lives.

21
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,197
Sleepover!

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,159
Lucky me! Free shards of glass.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,654
-So what are you guys doing tonight?
-We're having a sleepover.

24
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,781
It's at my house, and you can't come.

25
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,533
We're playing the new "Hooker Killer."

26
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,868
Okay, eww, that game is so misogynistic.

27
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,121
The whole point
is just to kill women with jobs.

28
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,082
Remember, they're not women,
they're hookers.

29
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,459
Stop quoting your dad's
stupid law commercials.

30
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,378
If the ads are stupid,
how come they went viral?

31
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,964
-Because they went bad viral.
-There's no such thing as bad viral!

32
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,676
-Name one thing that's viral that's bad.
-HIV.

33
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,888
You mean the most famous
autoimmune disease in existence?

34
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,056
Come on!

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,767
[groans] Jay is such a jerk.

36
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,145
You don't need those gross boys.

37
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,898
-Have your own sleepover.
-With who?

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,194
-I don't really have many girlfriends.
-Well, what about them?

39
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,571
Devin and Lola?

40
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,867
[Mistress]  ♪ Popular girls
Walkin' down the hallway ♪

41
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,704
♪ Flat-iron hair
Calling the fuckin' shots ♪

42
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,206
I don't really want to be friends
with the popular girls.

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,586
Of course you do.
Everybody wants to be friends with Devin.

44
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,129
She's the queen bee.

45
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,674
And you want their honey. Bzzz.

46
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,385
-Hey, Devin.
-Hey. What's up,  chica ?

47
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,846
Hola, mujer.

48
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,348
I know it is  lasto minuto--  [groans]

49
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,766
I'm just gonna speak in English.

50
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,603
Do you guys maybe want to come
to a sleepover at my house tonight?

51
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,523
Interesting. Yeah, I've been looking
to diversify my friend group.

52
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,775
-Wait, what?
-I could use a smart girl.

53
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,736
-Double wait, what?
-Great!

54
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,988
It'll be fun.
We'll be like  Little Women.

55
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,658
Little women? Are you calling me a midge?
'Cause you're a nobody.

56
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,076
-Lola.
-[Missy] Oh, no.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,496
I think she was probably talking about
the novel  Little Women.

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,042
It's a touching story about sticking
together in the face of the Civil War.

59
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,462
Yes, that. Missy, do you want
to come to the sleepover too?

60
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,756
-Ah! I'd love to come.
-What are you doing?

61
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,009
I could use another smart girl there.
These chicks are scary.

62
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,469
I've never been to a sleepover.

63
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,305
There's a nightgown I've been saving
for a very special occasion.

64
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,391
It was my grandmother's. She died in it.
One day I will also pass away.

65
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,602
Maybe in this, who knows?
Maybe during the sleepover. Just kidding!

66
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,979
This is actually gonna be interesting.

67
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,148
-Let's do it.
-Yeah, let's do it.

68
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,152
And Jessi, just like logistically,
Devin is my best friend.

69
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,489
If you get too close to her
I will literally end you.

70
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,616
Yay, a sleepover!

71
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,078
Okay, sweetie, now,
you sure you don't want me to cancel?

72
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,412
-It's fine.
-'Cause I will.

73
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,123
Go have fun with Cantor Dinelle.
I'll be okay.

74
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,792
Dad will be the designated adult.

75
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,253
What do you think the deal is
with Sour Patch Kids?

76
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,505
Probably all come
from different fathers, right?

77
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,174
-"My dad was a lemon."
-"My dad was a purple."

78
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,009
Actually, your dad is a lemon.

79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,011
-Okay, Shannon.
-Okay, Greg.

80
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,181
[Andrew's Mom] Okay, you have
your salicylic acid,

81
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,058
acne wash, and your scraping brush?

82
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,060
-Got 'em.
-What about your special pillow?

83
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,814
It's not special.
In fact, I might not even take it.

84
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,483
-You're not gonna take "Pilbo Baggins"?
-Mom!

85
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,695
You have been on some
very unexpected journeys together.

86
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,615
Yes, I'm being made fun of for coming up
with an awesome name for my pillow.

87
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,368
-Goodbye, Mrs. Glouberman.
-Goodbye, sweetheart.

88
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,536
Bye, Mom.

89
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,664
Remember, Andrew-- be afraid of things.

90
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,082
Okay, love you too, Mom.

91
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,085
-Hi.
-Hi, Jessi.

92
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,921
Your house is beautiful,
but your driveway needs to be repaved.

93
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,673
These are my parents,
they're both professors.

94
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:03,344
Holy smokes! Your dog
looks like Nathan Fillion.

95
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,679
Did you see  Firefly ?

96
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,307
Sort of a Western sci-fi
genre hybrid, but--

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,434
look at ol' Dad geeking out again.

98
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,603
If you're a geek,
then I don't wanna be cool.

99
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,938
Okay.

100
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,692
Missy, here are your snacks--
edamame and carrots.

101
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,569
Sugar makes me spazz out.

102
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,405
She has what the Incans call
"la fuerza de azúcar."

103
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,573
"Sugar strength"!

104
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,658
Maybe we should lay down
some ground rules.

105
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,370
I know we're not doing bedtimes,
but maybe we can sleep in shifts.

106
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,332
-I'd hate to lose my Saturday.
-No, just relax.

107
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,624
Tonight is gonna be baller.

108
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,461
It will be baller than most...
anything else.

109
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,671
-Am I using that at all right?
-No.

110
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,257
Go around to the side!
Kids can't use the front door.

111
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,300
Clients only.

112
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,760
-Hi, Jay.
-Hey.

113
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,013
This place looks like
the Holocaust Museum.

114
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,599
-Big dog!
-Oh, God, big dog!

115
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,601
That's just our pit bull,
Featuring Ludacris.

116
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,978
He won't hurt you guys,
will you, Featuring Ludacris?

117
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,855
Are you a good featured artist?

118
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,815
He's grumpy, 'cause he has
a rare medical condition

119
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,692
that makes him aware
of his own existence.

120
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,110
[whines]

121
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,196
Let me give you the tour.

122
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,698
My bros and I are developing
a shitstorm worth of extreme sports,

123
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,451
like "breakball,"
"golf punch," and "peep-kour."

124
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,787
-"Peep-kour"? wow.
-Have you heard of it?

125
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,288
No, no one ever has.

126
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,707
It's a cross between parkour
and peeping tomfoolery.

127
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,126
Here, watch, check this out.
[grunting]

128
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,171
[Mrs. Albert] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

129
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,548
-Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Albert.
-Hi, Jay!

130
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,466
That was awesome.

131
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,635
I got 10 points 'cause I saw
both their buttholes.

132
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,056
I love your kitchen.
It looks so... what is the word?

133
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,974
Shitty. Do you guys have any Cokes?

134
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,060
Yeah, we have Cokes.

135
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,604
Missy, do you want some
unsweetened cranberry juice?

136
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,439
Nope. I want to try a Coke.

137
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,483
Missy, aren't you not supposed
to have sugar?

138
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,152
Oh, my God, what are you,
like, her mom?

139
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,154
Yeah. Are you gonna divorce her dad

140
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,698
and then marry some guy
who lives in another state,

141
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,910
and then sometimes your daughter
has to, like, Uber to school

142
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:55,915
because it's cheaper for you
to fly back on a Tuesday, or like what?

143
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,084
Jessi, I-I appreciate your concern,

144
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,462
but I'm a part of this group now
and I'd like to try a Coke.

145
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,508
Let's do makeovers, you guys.
Where's your makeup?

146
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,761
I don't have makeup
but I do have sunscreen.

147
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,514
Okay, sweetie,
where's your mom's makeup?

148
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,891
[Jay] Everything I know
I owe to my brothers.

149
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,351
[Nick] Where are Val and Curt?

150
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,229
Oh, man. They're at some bitchin'
high school party tonight.

151
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,022
They made me trim their pubes
before they left

152
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,192
because they are out there
swingin' dicks and bonin' chicks.

153
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,444
Oh, man!

154
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,864
Okay, so, this is our percussion room.

155
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,657
This is the armory.

156
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,325
And this is the door we never open.

157
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,957
And we never open it because
something quite terrible is behind it...?

158
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,334
Andrew, it's the door
we never open. Okay.

159
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,589
And finally, this is where
the magic happens.

160
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,924
-Literally.
-Jesus!

161
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,720
Was that a pigeon spray-painted white
to look like a dove?

162
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,055
-A magician never reveals his secrets.
-[Nick] Okay.

163
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,267
Now, there's someone very special
I want you guys to meet.

164
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,978
-That's a pillow.
-No, no, no, no.

165
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,481
She's so much more than a pillow.

166
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,651
Marrone.  Don't you want
to just stick your dick in her?

167
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,487
Hey, what's that, now?

168
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,157
-Jay, do you... fuck the pillow?
-Yeah, my same question.

169
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,910
Oh, yeah, guys, I fuck my pillow.

170
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,581
I'm sorry, my tone was off.
Yes, I 100-percent fuck my pillow.

171
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,500
First, I make a slit.

172
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,085
Not too long,
careful as to not rip the edges,

173
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,171
making what I call "the husband stitch."

174
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,256
Then, I take two Ziploc bags

175
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,258
and I fill them
with Amy's Organic Lentil Soup,

176
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,512
which I microwave
to exactly 98.6 degrees--

177
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,057
not enough to burn you,
but just enough to feel warm and inviting.

178
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,851
Then I place them
in the slit of the pillow.

179
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,772
There's another slit in the back,
but that's only for my birthday.

180
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,358
-This kid might be a genius.
-What do you do for cleanup?

181
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,817
I eat the soup.

182
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,944
It's in the bag!

183
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,571
You know, Jay,
Andrew has a special pillow, too.

184
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,114
-Let me see.
-No! God damn it!

185
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,616
Don't touch him, please.

186
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,244
Yours is a him. Interesting, Andrew.

187
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,913
It's okay, big guy.
No one's touching Pilbo.

188
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,124
-That's your special pillow.
-It's not my special pillow.

189
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,919
It's just a pillow.
And it is normal for me

190
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,672
to not want Jay
to stick his penis inside it.

191
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,633
Just a little powder, and  voilà.

192
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,180
I'm sorry, am I gorgeous right now?

193
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,559
Take a selfie of yourself
and get Devin in there,

194
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,020
so everyone knows
that you fucks with the big dogs.

195
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,106
#Stunning.

196
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,317
You should see how long it takes
with this dump truck.

197
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,989
That's funny. We can say terrible things
to each other because we're so close.

198
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,534
Now that I see you all made up
you're like, naturally very pretty.

199
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,911
-Yeah, if you, like, like Jews.
-Lola.

200
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,497
What? We're all joking.
I'm a dump truck.

201
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,292
[Missy yells] Guys!
What should we do next?

202
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,587
Can I drink out of the goldfish bowl?
I won't eat the fish, maybe I will!

203
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,088
Missy, are you okay?

204
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,675
Yeah, you look kind of psycho.

205
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,679
[Missy] Nope, I'm hunky-dory,
or should I say horsey-donkey?

206
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,849
[laughing hysterically]
Make me pretty like Jessi!

207
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,767
Maybe you should have
a drink of water or something.

208
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,644
Maybe you should suck my dick!

209
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,940
I said, make me pretty like Jessi!

210
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,775
Why are you wasting ammo?

211
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,986
[Jay] You are in strangling range. Andrew!

212
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,113
[Andrew] Oh, my God,
they die in real time?

213
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,741
Yeah, you watch their souls
leave their bodies.

214
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,409
A nun's covering her with a blanket.

215
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,785
-[Andrew] This is fucked-up.
-[Jay] Grab the soul!

216
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,996
-Grab the soul!
-[Andrew] I got the coins, here you go.

217
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,748
Okay, wash your bloody hands
in the fountain,

218
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,791
-and we gotta get outta here.
-Oh, a gela-teria.

219
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,917
It's pronounced  gelate-ria.

220
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,003
How many coins do you have?
We can both buy a gelato.

221
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,421
[Andrew] Hey, what the hell?

222
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,548
I'm sorry, were you
in the middle of a game?

223
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,592
Val, Curt, don't be assholes!

224
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,427
Yeah, don't be assholes,
you fucking assholes.

225
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,512
I thought you guys
were at a cool high school party.

226
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,806
We did make an appearance,
grabbed some tit.

227
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,017
That part was rad.
But when you get to be our age,

228
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,936
you'll see those parties,
they're full of fakers, full of skanks.

229
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,190
Would you two care to play some
"Hooker Killer: Vatican City" with us?

230
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,984
Game for babies.
You guys want to see some real sex?

231
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,027
We already saw your neighbors.

232
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,863
We're talking about one
of the greatest pornographic works

233
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,698
in the history of skinema.

234
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:02,286
It stars the Italian Stallion himself,
Mr. Sylvester Stallone.

235
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,206
-That's my buddy Frank's brother.
-Did it before he was famous.

236
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,626
Just a struggling actor
with a thick, meaty cock.

237
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,505
Yes. So tired of jacking off
to the ladies from  SportsCenter.

238
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,508
Well, I would certainly not be opposed
to seeing that film.

239
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,511
Today's the day, Andrew Glouberman,
you become a man.

240
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,637
Mazel tov! [yells]

241
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,850
I didn't wrap a napkin around the glass
and I don't wear shoes! Oh, God!

242
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,269
Are you bitches ready?

243
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,479
Here she is.

244
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,191
I love these sock boobs.
They're real bazongas.

245
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,486
-I like grabbing on to 'em.
-That's good, 'cause nobody else will.

246
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,657
Oh, gosh, isn't she tragic, Jessi?

247
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,744
Agree with Devin. She is the alpha,
and she must be satiated.

248
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,996
-No.
-Missy is the weak one.

249
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,706
She must be sacrificed.

250
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,378
She looks like one of the meth heads from
the sex scene in  Dallas Buyers Club.

251
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,049
Oh, my God. I don't know what
that movie is, but that sounds spot-on.

252
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,052
Let's do nails. Let's paint them up.
I want to do nails!

253
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,223
-Do my nails or suck my dick!
-I am so glad you invited her.

254
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,392
Every party needs entertainment.

255
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,562
Normally I would just have Lola
spread a rumor about herself.

256
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,148
I'm lesbians with my mom.

257
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,399
[Curt and Jay grunt]

258
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,235
This is crazy.
Why is Jay doing this?

259
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,196
You're an only child. You don't get it.
This is how brothers are with each other.

260
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,699
He's right. My brother's a real asshole.
Want to see a picture?

261
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,325
I fuckin' love this guy.

262
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,495
Oh, my God! Is he dead?

263
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,789
Jesus, Jay, are you okay?

264
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,082
How long was I out?

265
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,127
My record is two and a half minutes.
Let's do it again!

266
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,588
Nah. I want to see these gaywads fight.

267
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,133
-No, no, no.
-Thank you, Curt, but I think we're good.

268
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,551
-Oh, you're good?
-Yeah.

269
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,221
Okay, they're good.
Well, eat my swampy ass, bitch!

270
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,183
You want to see porn?
You gotta pay for it in blood.

271
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,019
Blood for sex?
That's some old-school shit. I'm into it.

272
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,396
Blood. Nick, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

273
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,522
Sure.

274
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,277
-Look, I don't want to fight you.
-I don't want to be here at all.

275
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,488
Think we can just, you know,
pretend to fight.

276
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,867
Yeah, maybe throw a couple soft,
fake hits and then it's porn city.

277
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,327
-What could go wrong?
-What could go wrong?

278
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,038
-[crowd noise]
-Ladies and gentleturds,

279
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,916
welcome to the octagon of death.

280
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,085
In this corner,
weighing in at practically nothing,

281
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,339
it's "Polly Pocket" herself,
the "Lilliputian Leprechaun,"

282
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,299
Saint Nick!

283
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,092
BLOOD! BLOOD! WE REQUIRE BLOOD!

284
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,345
One at a time!
Vegas odds only!

285
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,389
And in this corner:
the "Fiddler on the Roof,"

286
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,644
the "Pubescent Delicatessen,"
the Gloubermensch!

287
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,270
Now fight!

288
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,772
-Little right.
-Yeah, there you go.

289
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,065
Rip his face off!

290
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,441
-Sorry.
-No, no, we're good.

291
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,901
-Too hard?
-No blood, no porn!

292
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,944
-Nice hook.
-Thank you.

293
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,404
Kiss! Kiss on the mouth!

294
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,407
Oh, shit! Are you okay?
I'm sorry, man.

295
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm bleeding, you asshole!

296
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,412
Blood? Blood.

297
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,499
Don't think, react!
Tear his fucking head off!

298
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,626
-Motherfucker!
-Ow!

299
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,922
Jesus! What the hell?
We were supposed to be pretending.

300
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,590
[grunting and gasping]

301
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,468
Tear his face off!
Hit him with the  hai...

302
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,470
-Get off me!
-[Val and Curt laugh]

303
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,597
This is even better than
"Killing Hookers."

304
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,767
Okay, Jessi, who do you have a crush on?

305
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,311
-And you can't say nobody.
-I have a crush!

306
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,605
It's TV's Nathan Fillion.
I wanna kiss him.

307
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,108
I don't know who that is,
so he sounds stupid.

308
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,318
Au contraire,  Nathan Fillion's a hunk!

309
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,989
Oh, man, I should stop her.
She's on a serious sugar high.

310
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,867
Hush, puppy. Let her dig her own grave.

311
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,202
Sometimes I like to imagine a scenario
where we're friends

312
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,662
and we solve crimes, like  Castle,

313
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,581
but the crimes are in space,
like  Firefly,

314
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:38,502
and then we fall in love, but we stay
best friends at the same time.

315
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,546
Missy, I'm falling in love with you,

316
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,382
but I also want to stay best friends
with you at the same time.

317
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,092
Oh, Nathan Fillion.

318
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,177
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you

319
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,179
solving space crimes, doing homework,

320
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,764
and listening
to  Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.

321
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,892
But first, let's dance the merengue.

322
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,103
Because I spent time in Latin America
and understand other cultures.

323
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,439
You are so beautiful, Missy.

324
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,818
-May I kiss you with my mouth?
-Of course, Nathan Fillion.

325
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,614
-Ruff! Ruff!
-[dog barking]

327
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,661
-Oh, my God, this is the best thing ever.
-[laughs] Oh, my God.

328
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,079
Missy, what is wrong with you?

329
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,040
What? Why? Why are you mad at me?

330
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm mad because you're so weird.
Why can't you be more normal?

331
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,340
You're being really mean, Jessi.
I thought we were gonna be friends.

332
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,719
I am trying to be your friend,
but you make it so hard!

333
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,262
Stop yelling at me.

334
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,390
All I wanted was to be
a part of a fun sleepover--

335
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,186
-[Lola] Oh, my God!
-No! Darn it, Nathan Fillion.

336
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,479
Don't eat that.

337
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,440
-Are we having fun or what?
-Or what.

338
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,109
Please, it wasn't on purpose.
You leaned into the punch.

339
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,319
Eat shit.

340
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,905
Okay, look,
let's lighten the mood a little.

341
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,116
You know what we need?
To harness the healing power of magic.

342
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,494
You gonna pull a rabbit out of your butt?

343
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,496
-Magic's gay.
-Magic is not gay.

344
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,247
-It transcends sexuality.
-Gay.

345
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,916
-You assholes unplugged our game!
-Gay.

346
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,210
You kicked me in the face,
and I take it all...

347
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,795
-Right up your butt?
-Next to the rabbit?

348
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,756
I fuckin' hate you guys!
These are my friends,

349
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,468
and you ruined
a whole night sleepover!

350
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,262
You guys are the worst! [crying]

351
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,100
All right, next task:
you guys have got--

352
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,810
No! No next task.

353
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,688
You said if we fought each other
we could watch a porno.

354
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,149
And we fought each other, brother,
we fought each other!

355
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,610
-So show me the porno.
-Show us the porno.

356
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,071
-We've been through so much!
-Show us the goddamn porno!

357
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,864
All right, jeez! Calm down, ladies.

358
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,658
I didn't realize
it was this important to you.

359
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,327
-We can watch the porno right now.
-Oh, thank God!

360
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,247
Just as soon as we have a light snack.

361
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,418
The name of the game is "Jizzcuit,"

362
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,170
AKA "Ookie-Cookie,"
AKA "Cum on a Cracker."

363
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,172
It's very simple.
We stand around in a circle

364
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,716
and jerk off onto a Triscuit.

365
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,384
Last one to come eats it.

366
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,594
Wait, what's that now?

367
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,596
But, and here's why
we're men of our word,

368
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,392
you get to watch the porno
while you jerk off, so everybody wins.

369
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,853
Except for the bitch who has to eat
the cum-soaked cracker.

370
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,897
-[gags]
-Wow, okay, a lot to process here.

371
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,941
On the one hand, we get to watch porn,

372
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,985
but on the other
we might have to eat cum.

373
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,946
But on the third hand,
I'm looking at prepubescent Nick

374
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,366
and I don't think his "frosting factory's"
open for business yet.

375
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,619
But on the fourth hand
that fucker punched you in the face,

376
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,039
so he can eat a dick and a jizzcuit.

377
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,707
[whimpers]

378
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,128
Pardon me, Val, may I see
that cracker for a second?

379
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,255
Sure. It's low-sodium, for now.

380
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,842
What the hell, you assclown?
Now we have to get another Triscuit!

381
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,802
You two, don't go anywhere.

382
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,473
-Nick, we're getting you out of here.
-What? Why?

383
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,893
This has been a terrible night, filled
with many dark and regrettable things.

384
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,812
Years from now we'll talk about this
at a party, thinking it's funny,

385
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,314
and then immediately feel embarrassed

386
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,691
and realize this was almost certainly
child abuse.

387
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,110
-Let's go.
-Do you think we can get out of here?

388
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,948
My dear boy, I make this vow--
no cum shall enter your tummy.

389
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,993
-A broken promise I made to Rod Stewart.
-Is that true?

390
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,912
You're picturing it,
we're talking about it.

391
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,247
-What?
-A callback to the last episode.

392
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,666
They're binge-watching it.
You're binge-watching it, right?

393
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,754
I can't wait for you to see the next one.
Jessi discovers her vagina.

394
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,798
It's a very sex-positive episode.

396
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,178

to make fun of me.

No, I didn't.

00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,016

It's awesome. I got her
full-on Frenching your dog.

-Come on, guys, you can't post that.
-No one touches my phone!

-Let go of the phone!
-Stop trying to make out with me, lesbo!

-I know.

490
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,910
Wow, you really pulled a Cyrano, Jessi.

491
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,538
Oh, Missy, I'm so sorry I was mean.

492
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,625
And I'm sorry I made you say that stuff.

493
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,336
I just wanted you to be popular

494
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,004
and have flat-iron hair

495
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,007
and call the fucking shots!

496
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,510
And I'm sorry I spazzed out.

497
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,347
This really has been a harrowing ordeal
of emotional brutality.

498
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,226
So, the crying portion of the evening
has concluded,

499
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,936
and now it's time to watch a movie.

500
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,815
Or we could watch  Castle
starring Nathan Fillion.

501
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,817
That sounds good to me.

502
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,903
Damn it, it's not here.

503
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,864
[sniffs] Andrew, do you smell that?

504
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,074
-Lentils.
-Lentils.

505
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,744

507
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,333
Thank God, no slits.

508
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,585
Hey, why do you guys
have all your stuff?

509
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,546
Because we have to go home, Jay.

510
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,673
Your brothers are trying
to make us eat jizz.

511
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,383
[Val] Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

512
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,510
[Curt] We found a Tostitos Scoop.

513
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,013
-Jay, come with us.
-No, Andrew. My place is here.

514
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,100
Go. The window. I'll cover you guys.

515
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,103
Okay, aim for the trampoline.

516
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,396
-Nick?
-Yeah, Andrew?

517
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,356
Can I sleep over at your place?

518
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,567
Sure, Andrew,
if the fall doesn't cripple us

519
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,279
-you can totally sleep over.
-[Val] Come out, wherever you are!

520
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,363
[both screaming]

521
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,740
[both yelling, slow-motion sound effect]

522
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,619
[slow-motion sound effect]
Look, the Alberts are still going at it.

523
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,955
[slow-motion sound effect -
The Alberts grunt and groan]

524
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,791
[slow-motion sound effect]
This is the best night of my life!

525
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,711
[slow-motion sound effect]
Sleepover!

526
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,596
[Kate]  Wait a minute, Castle,
if Arroyo's a trained lifeguard--

527
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,639
[Castle]  Then who was wearing
those water wings?

528
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,560
This show is great.
Their chemistry's undeniable.

529
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,438
We actually shot this scene
day-for-night, L.A. for New York.

530
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,355
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

531
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,150
-You do a heck of a job, my man.
-Thanks. You're too much.

532
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,111
Oh, my God, what a rush, right?

533
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,863
I mean, that's exciting!

534
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,407
Oh, Andrew.

535
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,076
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

536
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,704
No, no, no. It's okay, Nick.

537
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:02,042
It's probably time
for pillows to just be pillows.

538
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,379
But, you know, it's a bummer
we went through all of that

539
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,506
and never got to see Stallone bone.

540
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,968
Actually, I did manage to grab this
on the way out.

541
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:12,969
[clears throat]

542
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,054
Check this out.

543
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,723
[Nick] Andrew, nicely done.

544
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,642
Wait, does your family even have a VCR?

545
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,395
We do, but there's this Jane Fonda
workout tape stuck in it.

546
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,440
[Nick] It's kind of amazing that Jay's
not more screwed up than he is, right?

547
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,651
[Andrew] His mom called us pussies.

548
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,403
[Nick] And his brothers make him
for real eat their jizz.

549
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,113
[Andrew] Look at all these houses.

550
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,325
You never know how many people
are inside eating jizz.
