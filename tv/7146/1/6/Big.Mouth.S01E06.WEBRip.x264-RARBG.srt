00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:09,676
[Jay grunting] Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,928
Oh, yeah...

3
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,305
[shouting] Abra-cum-dabra!

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,307
Ha! Ta-da!
[chuckles]

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,519
-Whoo! That was amazing.
-So good.

6
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,062
Yeah. I really unloaded in you.

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,190
-I love you, too.
-All right! [laughs]

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,109
I'm gonna go wash my dick off
before school.

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,986
Wait, Jay, can I talk to you
about something?

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:32,365
Ugh. Okay, listen, for the last time
I am not gonna take you apple picking.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,161
No, it's not that.
I don't know how to say this, but...

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,663
-I'm late.
-Late? You're a pillow.

13
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,416
-You have nowhere to go.
-No, Jay. I'm pregnant.

14
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,251
What?! [laughs]

15
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,004
Nice. I mean, how would that
even be possible?

16
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,882
Come on, don't be naive, Jay.
I told you to use protection.

17
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,468
What? No, I thought
you meant from stains!

18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,304
-I'm not ready to have a baby!
-Well, you better get ready.

19
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,306
Oh, man! Oh, man! This is--

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,226
[mother] Boys, wash your dicks
and get ready for school!

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,103
-[brother 1] Okay, Mom!
-[brother 2] Already on it, Ma!

22
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,480
Shit, I'm late to wash my dick.

23
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,056
[clarinet plays]

24
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,517
[hits sour note]

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,854
Wow, that was not good.

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,357
My whole thing is like,
he's bad at clarinet.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,318
-True, but nobody else auditioned.
-He's wearing a hat.

28
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,694
I also like his hat.

29
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,571
He reminds me of a young Woody Allen

30
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,782
playing a surprise gig
at the Carlyle Hotel.

31
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,367
Woody Allen. Ho-ho.

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,036
That guy is 85 pounds of pure sex.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,330
Woody Allen was accused of molestation.

34
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,125
He says he didn't do it,
but he did marry his stepdaughter.

35
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,752
It is both very complicated
and very simple.

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,130
-I say we let Andrew in.
-God help us.

37
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,257
Andrew, welcome to Jazz Club.

38
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,051
And on a personal note,
I like your fedora.

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,555
It evokes jazz's colorful past
and funky future.

40
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,307
That was the exact vibe
I was trying to summon.

41
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,561
Good banter. Now tell her you want
to wear her ass as a hat.

42
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,272
-Really? Should I?
-No, no, don't do that.

43
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm off my game.
The Woody Allen stuff really threw me.

44
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,361
That guy's a hero. Not artistically,
just personally speaking.

45
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,279
[bell ringing]

46
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,739
Remember that girl from camp
I told you about, Roland?

47
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,160
Oh, yeah, Roland. I was picturing
an older man named Roland.

48
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,537
Right. No, I didn't kiss
an older man at camp.

49
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,165
-The heart wants what it wants.
-Anyway, she texted me last night.

50
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,708
Quote, "Come into the city tomorrow.

51
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,419
-We should hang out and whatevs."
-Ooh!

52
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,088
-Do you know what "whatevs" means?
-Short for whatever.

53
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,675
No, I think "whatevs" implies
that she wants to make out.

54
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,552
Making out with a city girl. Wow.

55
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,679
Andrew, we are going to New York.

56
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,224
Me? Or, I'm sorry,
is there a fun person behind me?

57
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,184
Like a dumb idiot, wears a fun shirt?

58
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,978
No, you. You're fun.

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,397
Oh, no, Nick. No, no, thank you,
but I am not fun.

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,608
-I have many virtues. I'm loyal.
-Uh-huh.

61
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,860
-I have a huge puffy winter coat--
-The biggest.

62
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,237
But fun? No.
I think you should go by yourself.

63
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,031
But I want to go with my best friend.

64
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,450
And Andrew, I didn't want to play
the jazz card,

65
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,701
but what about jazz?

66
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:26,372
Andrew, jazz is about taking risks.
It's the only way you get better.

67
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,124
-At jazz?
-At life!

68
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,959
Jazz is like life.

69
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,878
It goes on for longer than you think,

70
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,006
and then as soon as you're like,
"I get it," it ends.

71
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,341
-Oh.

Oh, hey, Duke.

Hey, Maurice.

00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,562
You got that seven dollars you owe me?

I, uh... [clears throat]

77
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,525
Andrew, you gotta listen to the Duke.
There's literally hundreds

78
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,987
of blonde Puerto Rican women
in New York City. Yum, yum.

79
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,156
-Come on, Andrew, adventure!
-Jazz!

Excuse me, has anyone
thought about our parents?

83
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,248
You know, they can track
our cell phones.

84
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,958
That's why we're giving
our phones to Jessi.

85
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,878
Hey, Jessi, what if you went with Nick
and I stayed safe and fine?

I've got bat mitzvah stuff all afternoon.

87
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,341
But I do think this is good for you,
Andrew.

88
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,718
-I am so scared.
-Well, embrace it, girl.

89
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,470
-I'm a boy.
-Get out of your comfort zone.

90
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,764
Yeah, conquer your fears
and do what I want.

How do we even get out of class?

92
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,727
Well, these notes from your parents
were obviously forged...

Oh, my God.

94
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,106
...in the fires of good parenting.

95
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,858
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-Your folks understand the value

96
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,027
of an unsupervised field trip
to Manhattan,

97
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,406
which doesn't sound suspicious
to me at all.

98
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,783
I feel guilty exploiting this man.

99
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,786
I think he's really genuinely happy
to have any human contact.

100
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,289
You know, I'll actually be
in the city myself later.

Brewing Company.

-[laughs] That hat is hilarious!
-It's my jazz hat.

Oh, boy, you're sincerely
wearing that hat.

112
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,573

from when my grandfather died.

-$199.

-Thanks for staying home.

what you wanna do?

-About what?
-You know, like, pregnancy-wise.

120
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,222
-Are you suggesting...?
-No, not at all.

121
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,849
-Unless you wanna...
-I'm keeping it.

122
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,478
Of course! I'm keeping it, too, 'cause
that's what we're doing, keeping it.

to have a baby.

-I mean, I am 40.
-What?!

-I'm from your grandparents' house.
-Holy shit!

126
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,780
-What's the big deal?
-Wait, how old do you think I am?

127

I know! That's why I secretly
want you to get rid of it!

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,554
It's like the mall but it's on your head.

165
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,764
Well, I'll have you know
I got it at the mall.

166
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,351
[chuckles] So, how do you two know Roland?
Are you dating her?

167
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,062
-Andrew.
-I only ask 'cause I know Nick likes her.

168
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,064
Or, I'm sorry,
are you two dating each other?

169
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,275
Like, as gays,
or maybe you're just people?

170
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,028
Andrew, please, shut the fuck up.

171
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:11,324
Yes! Mr. Boring, you are
my next art installation.

172
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,951
I don't mean to be rude,
but what are you exactly?

173
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,578
Shush down. I'm Mint.

174
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,121
He is avant-garde artist.

175
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:21,459
I once put a question mark
after every sentence in the Bible.

176
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,419
I hate my parents.

177
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,171
Oh, yeah, me too.

178
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,466
Is that a picture of you
with Max Greenfield from  New Girl ?

179
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,675
Schmidt, yeah.

180
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,012
I guess we're, like, friends now.
I don't know.

181
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,432
-He's too clingy.
-Cool, cool, we're cool.

182
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,269
-So what are you doing in the city?
-You texted me to come in.

183
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,690
-So you just like, came in?
-No, I was coming in anyway.

184
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,528
I wanted to go to the Freedom Tower
and pay my respects.

185
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,614
You're like this little country mouse,
huh?

186
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,699
-Coming in from Westchester.
-Uh...

187
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,369
Well, this city cat's gonna corrupt you.

188
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,537
Okay.

189
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,163
Nick-- Hi, Roland.

190
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,250
-Uh, hi?
-Nick, they're snorting pills out there.

191
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,669
That's fine, Andrew,
'cause we're cool, too.

192
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,338
They saw me take my vitamin.
For dandruff, Roland.

193
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,716
I take a vitamin for dandruff.
They thought I was into pharmaceuticals.

194
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,593
Cool, Andrew, that's funny.

195
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,304
I'm gonna rat 'em out to the doorman.
I'm gonna rat out everyone.

196
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,890
-Andrew, you're panicking.
-Oh, the heli's here.

197
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,642
Of course, a helicopter.

198
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,894
Yeah. It's the only way to go to Montauk.

199
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,731
Mint is doing an installation
for Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

200
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,776
-who's gonna be there, I guess.
-You know The Rock?

201
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,902
He's so clingy.

202
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,866
-Nick, I'm not getting on a helicopter.
-What do you mean?

203
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,078
We came to the city for an adventure,
now we're gonna meet The Rock.

204
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:43,749
Right, and as tempting as that is,
I can't fly.

205
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,167
I have an inner ear thing.

206
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,753
What about when your family
flew to Europe?

207
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,755
That was a lie. We drove.

208
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,258
-To Europe?
-To Clearwater, Florida.

209
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,637
Come on, Andrew. I got so close
with Roland just now. I need this.

210
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,932
Andrew, Mint's dolphoodle's
gonna sit on your lap, 'kay?

211
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,601
Mint's dolpho-what now?

212
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,021
Dolphoodle. It's a cross
between a dolphin and a poodle.

213
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,774
-Andrew, you know him.
-I promise you I don't.

214
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,611
-[trills]
-Oh, dear God in heaven.

215
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,572
-Hi, boy.
-No, don't, my friend.

216
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,992
Kevin eats fingers.
He thinks they're baby corn.

217
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,202
-Who's Kevin?
-The dolphoodle.

218
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,831
-You have amnesia, you know him.
-So, Nick, are you coming?

219
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,751
I genuinely don't care,
but just make a decision.

220
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,796
-Look, I'm not getting on that helicopter.
-[sighs]

221
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,051
The kid I'm with can't fly.
Is there any way we can meet you there?

222
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,638
Yeah, sure, whatever.
It's Dwayne's place, it's on the beach.

223
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,223
Great. We'll see you there, no problem.

224
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,144
[Mint] Andrew, remember
what I never told you,

225
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,104
a scream can be music.

226
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,981
I will, Mint.

227
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,566
Oh, no, no, my hat!

228
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,735
Oh, shit, no! Oh!

229
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:57,448
[groans] It's gone. I'll never forget
the day I got that hat.

230
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,533
That'll be $199.

231
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,743
-[beeps]
-[Andrew] Um...

232
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,578
It's a chip, man. You gotta stick it in.

233
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,665
-Yeah, it's not working.
-Fuck. Let me see it.

234
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,084
Oh, fuck me. James?

235
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,878
Tanisha!

236
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,506
-Nick, we have to find my hat.
-We have to go to Montauk.

237
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,801
We're not going anywhere
until we find my hat.

238
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,805
Fine, okay, we will find your jazz hat
and then we will go to Montauk.

239
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:25,309
And at some point I actually am
going to need that Ezekiel bread.

240
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,229
-Right, for your dandruff vitamin.
-Yeah, it's a twice daily.

241
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,523
Babe! Babe, unlock the door!

242
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,858
What's going on in there?
Are you okay?

243
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,485
[panting]

244
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,405
Jay, I felt it kick.

245
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,948
What? Who kicked you?
I'll kick his ass!

246
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,200
-No, the baby. It's moving.
-What?

247
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,620
So just to clarify, that means
the aborsh is completely off the tabes?

248
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,330
-Yeah, Jay.
-Okay, good, yeah, yeah.

249
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,708
'Cause technically you can do it
up until the baby's crowning.

250
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,752
Stop quoting your dad's law commercials.

251
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,504
Come here and feel it.

252
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,964
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

253
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,216
Holy shit, babe, we created a life.

254
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,220
-We did.
-This might be my greatest magic trick.

255
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,597
-We did it together.
-It's like I'm the magician

256
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,809
-and you're my trusted assistant.
-Maybe we're both the magician.

257
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,938
Pam, will you make me
the happiest magician on Earth?

258
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,981
Oh, Jay.

259
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,400
-No.
-What?!

260
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,279
I will throw myself down the stairs
and frame you for the murder!

261
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,448
All right, it's clear what happened here.

262
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,285
The pillow, in a fit of rage,
threw the sexy child magician

263
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,120
down the stairs, he dies.

264
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,206
She took him down. Goose down.

265
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,126
Have you seen my sunglasses?

266
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,086
Are these your sunglasses?

267
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
Whoa! The kid's magic.

268
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,467
Um, excuse me,
have you seen this hat?

269
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,178
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen a lame jazz hat

270
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,096
that's keeping me from my ultimate goal?

271
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,018
Sweetie pie, have you tried
looking inside your own butthole?

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,707
-And truthfully Greg and I...
-Your husband.

327
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,334
...haven't been happy
in a really long time.

328
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,837
And, you know, he's checked out,
I'm trying to check in.

329
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,049
-Does Jessi know?
-No, and... [sighs]

330
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,551
-I don't want her to know yet.
-I see.

331
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,179
But I also know I can't ask you to lie.

332
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,432
So you need to do
what you think is right.

333
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,186
Oh, honey, your poor tummy.

334
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,604
I'm done. Wait--
[vomits]

335
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,272
He speaks for both of us.

336
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,942
Wait a sec, why aren't you two in school?

337
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,777
-Why are you kissing a lady?
-Yeah.

338
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,238
-Maybe I should just walk away.
-Maybe we will, too.

339
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,990
Let's just be normal

340
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,284
when we see you,
Seder second night.

341
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,333
-Why won't you marry me?
-Honey, you're still a child.

342
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,210
How would you even support us?

343
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,420
I don't know.
I'll do whatever I have to do.

344
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,839
We're in this together, Pam.
I fuckin' love you.

345
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,468
I love you, too, Jayvid Blaine.
[giggles]

346
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,553
-What'd you say?
-Jayvid Blaine.

347
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,681
-Oh, yeah.
-Jay, put it in.

348
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,641
Okay. Damn it.

349
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,434
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. It's just--

350
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,144
It hasn't happened to me before.
Hold on.

351
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,563
I'm just gonna cram it in soft,
hope it gets hard inside.

352
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,608
-You think I'm disgusting, don't you?
-What? No, no, no!

353
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,527
-Of course not.
-I'm huge!

354
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,072
-No, you look beautiful.
-I'm bursting at my seams, Jay!

355
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,909
No, you look gorgeous,
are you kidding, babe?

356
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,745
Honestly, I think I'm just
worried about, you know,

357
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,163
hurting the baby with my huge dick.

358
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,583
Don't worry about the baby.
The baby's fine. I want you inside me.

359
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,961
-Yeah, say that again.
-I said I want you inside me.

360
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,630
-Mm, yeah!
-Oh, now you're hard.

361
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,966
I'm hard as like, ice.

362
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,218
-Jay, put it in.
-Oh! I'm 40!

363
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,763
-Yeah.
-My penis is next to the baby's head.

364
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,390
I'm rich!

365
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,725
That was crazy.

366
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,060
Shannon is having an affair
with a woman.

367
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,771
Poor Greg. God, poor Jessi.

368
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,565
Kinda puts things into perspective, huh?

369
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,942
Remember when your hat was important?
Not that it isn't.

370
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,402
-The jazz hat is gone.
-Yeah.

371
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,571
-So let's just go home.
-To Montauk.

372
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,572
-What?
-What?

373
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,158
-You can't be serious.
-Andrew, I looked for your hat,

374
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,076
so now we go to Montauk.
That was the deal.

375
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,663
Uh, no, I never explicitly agreed
to go to Montauk.

376
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,249
-Oh, my God, you're such a weasel.
-Excuse me?

377
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,169
Yeah, you're a scared weasel
with a bad ear,

378
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,004
dandruff, and the worst hat in America.

379
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,339
-What is with you and the hat?
-It's embarrassing!

380
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,091
It's embarrassing or I'm embarrassing?

381
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,720
-Forget it, just forget it.
-No, no, I want to hear it.

382
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,348
-What do you want to hear?
-You think you're cool and I'm a loser.

383
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,434
-Oh, please.
-Well, I've got news for you.

384
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,144
-You needed me.
-Oh, really?

385
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,355
Yeah, because you were too afraid
to go to the city alone.

386
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,400
Am I out of my mind here?
We could be at The Rock's house,

387
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,528
who you got a boner for,
which I never bring up

388
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,740
-because I'm such a nice guy.
-Look, why don't you go to Montauk.

389
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,326
I have 20 bucks,
I'm gonna take a cab home.

390
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,327
Oh, sorry.

391
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,413
Kid, you made me drop my cocaine.
You're gonna have to pay for that.

392
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,667
Uh, well, I don't understand
what's happening but I apologize.

393
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,088
You gotta pay me
for the cocaine you just spilled.

394
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,173
Please tell me you're the ghost
of Duke Ellington.

395
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,841
Duke who? Fuck you. Gimme that.

396
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,427
-Oh, this is a mugging.
-No, you're being scammed.

397
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,845
Mugging is more like...

398
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,555
Gimme all your money, fucko!

399
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,890
Here you go, sir.

400
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,018
Sir, you forgot your cocaines.

401
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,562
It's cocaine, Andrew, and it's not real.

402
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,272
-[thunder cracks]
-Oh, man.

403
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,027
[sighs] Sorry for farting.
[chuckles]

404
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,695
I'm just so relaxed around you.

405
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,031
No, I like the smell of your farts.

406
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
-They turn me on.
-Cool.

407
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,784
[groans]

408
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,619
Ooh, what is this, a delayed orgasm?

409
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,329
-[shouts out]
-Oh, yeah, baby, cum.

410
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,208
No, Jay, it's a contraction.
I'm going into labor.

411
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,960
Wait, wait, okay, where do we go,
the hospital?

412
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,045
A seamstress? Bed Bath & Beyond?
I don't know.

413
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,589
-There's no time, it's coming!
-What?! Already?

414
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,509
How long is the gestation period
of a human-pillow hybrid?

415
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,552
[screams]

416
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,886
[thunder]

417
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,639
This is so bad.

418
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,267
-We have no idea where we are.
-It's getting so late.

419
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,602
Our parents are probably
freaking out right now.

420
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,646
I would've done
so many things differently.

421
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,565
-I would've wiped better.
-What?

422
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,191
It's not like I didn't wipe,

423
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,361
but I should've wet the toilet paper
and just really gotten in there.

424
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,737
You didn't wipe well?

425
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,282
Roland had one of those stupid
Japanese toilets

426
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,493
-and I didn't know how it flushed.
-Oh, my God, we really are children.

427
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,538
That's what I've been telling you all day.
We're children.

428
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,039
We'll figure it out, okay?

429
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:30,043
-What are we gonna do?
-Why does that building have kneepads?

430
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,047
[angelic choir sings]

431
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,553
Um, excuse me, we're looking for Steve.
He's a regular.

432
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,221
No, no Steve here.

433
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,973
Hey, boys, over here. Over here.

434
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,185
For some reason everyone here
calls me  pendejo.

435
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,062
Oh, my God, Coach Steve,
you're a bartender?

436
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,523
Oh, you flatter me. No, barback.

437
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,027
My job is to get the egg smell
onto the water glasses.

438
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,696
-Coach Steve, we lied to you.
-There's no field trip.

439
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,240
-We were ditching school.
-And then we got robbed,

440
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,075
and we have no idea how to get home.

441
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me get this straight.

442
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,164
You looked me dead in the eye
and you lied to me?

443
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,083
That's a very intimate act
between friends.

444
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,419
-Can you help us get home?
-Please?

445
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,671
You come to me, your mentor...

446
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,924
-"Mentor" is a strong word.
-...in your hour of need

447
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,885
and you think I'm gonna turn you away?
No chance.

448
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,720
Patrick, set my boys up

449
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,474
with some of your Jamaican Me Crazy
jerk chicken wings on the house.

450
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,935
Pendejo,  man, you do not work here.

451
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,853
One more time and I'm calling the cops.

452
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,396
Oh, he'll do it. We should go.

453
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,191
And stop rubbing those damn eggs
on the glasses.

454
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,360
All right, Pat. I'll see you tomorrow.

455
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,362
-I'll bring my own eggs.
-The hell you will.

456
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,489
Oh, God! [shouts]

457
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,075
Just breathe, babe, just breathe.
You're doing great.

458
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,744
-I can't do this!
-Yes, you can. I'm right here.

459
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,037
We're doing it together.

460
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,456
-You and me?
-You and me, always you and me, Pam.

461
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,875
-[screams]
-It's coming, I can see the tag.

462
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,211
Oh, my God.

463
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,381
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

464
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,675
He looks just like you.

465
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,345
Does he? He kinda looks like my brother.

466
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,972
No, he doesn't look like Curt.

467
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,848
Why would you say Curt?

468
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,935
-Just...
-You lying bitch.

469
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,563
-You fucked my brother?
-I thought we had an open relationship.

470
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,898
What would give you that impression?

471
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,693
We have an open relationship.
Oh, yeah.

472
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,779
You can fuck anybody you want,
even my brothers.

473
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,491
Okay, yeah, I might have sent
some mixed signals.

474
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,785
Oh, Jay, Curt meant nothing to me.

475
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,829
With him it was just sex.

476
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,415
But with you, it's magic.

477
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,626
[sighs] You say such good stuff
out of your mouth.

478
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,420
I fucking love you so much.

479
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,630
I don't care if it's not my baby,
I'm gonna raise him.

480
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,841
Oh, my God, you're amazing.

481
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:44,720
You're just so generous, and you have
the best body in your grade.

482
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,096
-Come here. Yeah.
-Really?

483
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,057
-In front of Scorpion?
-Is that his name?

484
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,893
-I love it.
-Fuck yeah, it's his name and I love you.

485
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,729
I love you. Mm.

486
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,230
-Baby, baby... Be gentle.
-Oh, yeah.

487
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,192
-[Jay groans]
-I'm so sore. But I want it so bad.

488
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,069
[Jay] Oh, my God... [shouts]

489
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,614
I'm 41! Today's my birthday!

490
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,119
Holy stromboli, you guys
had an adventure today, huh?

491
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,332
It reminds me of that classic
The Doors song "Riders on the Storm".

492
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,793
-You mind if I play it?
-Oh, yeah, sure, go ahead, Coach Steve.

493
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,255
-Oh. Oh, okay.
-What a day.

494
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,381
-God.
-I know.

495
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,799
Nice to be sitting in a car--

496
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,970
- ♪ Storm ♪
-Well, not this car, but in theory, yes.

497
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,931
-But we got through it, right?
-Well, we got out of it.

498
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,893
- ♪ Born ♪
-Yeah. I'm sorry about the hat.

499
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,229
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry that I found you embarrassing.

500
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,690
I'm embarrassed by me all the time.

501
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,068
Ray Manzarek
with the haunting keys, huh?

502
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,780
And Andrew, those city kids,
they're not cooler than you.

503
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,532
Oh, Nick, thank you. But they are.
- ♪ Storm ♪

504
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,577
I know, I thought that was
the thing to say, you know?

505
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,456
Hey, I've been thinking,
and maybe we should tell Jessi

506
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,374
-about her mom.
-I know.

507
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,376
[sighs] It's gonna suck.

508
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,754
[Coach Steve] Hey, it stopped raining.

509
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,590
That was one hell of a...
♪ Storm! ♪

510
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,801
[Elliott] I'm very disappointed
in you, Nicholas.

511
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,387
But even more disappointed in myself,
and there's gonna be consequences.

512
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,266
I'm taking away my credit card
and giving it to you. Here you go.

513
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,602
In case you ever get lost
in the city again.

514
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,145
[sighs]

515
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,731
-And you wanted to be the bad cop.
-Yeah, that was my bad cop.

516
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:24,111
Honey, your punishment
is six weeks, no Netflix.

517
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,278
-[Nick] Six weeks?
-Mm-hm.

518
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,614
[sobs] You're gonna take away
Netflix, Mom?

519
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,034
This is so unfair!
What am I gonna do without Netflix?

520
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,577
What were you thinking?

521
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,955
You could have been lured
into an electronics store

522
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,166
by a pushy Israeli and forced
to buy a camera you don't want.

523
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,503
Worst of all, why would you go
to Patrick Ewing's Brewing Company?

524
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,881
That bum! All he did was take
fadeaway jumpers and sweat profusely.

525
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,217
You should've gone
to Kiki Vandeweghe's Tiki Hideaway.

526
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,219
-[sighs]
-That's a restaurant!

527
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:53,390
Babe, I'm finished washing my dick
if you're still psyched to blow me.

528
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,641
Babe?

529
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,976
Babe?

530
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,190
[Pam]  My darling Jay,
by the time you read this I'll be gone.

531
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,734
-What?!
- And I've taken Scorpion with me.

532
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,279
You shouldn't have to raise a child
that isn't yours.

533
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,905
Fucking bitch.

534
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,741
And I bet you're calling me
a fucking bitch right now.

535
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,244
That's so you, telling it like it is.

536
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,662
I'll miss that.

537
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,707
But most of all
I'll miss your great dick,

538
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,959
your ripped abs, all of it.

539
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,628
You're the whole package.
Plus you're rich?

540
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,797
What am I doing? You're a king.

541
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,008
No, no, I must go.

542
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,510
Goodbye, Jay. I love you.

543
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,887
[sobbing]

544
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,932
Oh, God, what am I gonna do?

545
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,768
-Ooh. Hello there.
-Put a rubber on, junior.

546
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:43,190
-I got athlete's foot all over me.
-Oh, I don't care one bit.

547
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,775
Ooh! You're already wet.

548
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,027
[bell ringing]

549
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,071
-Hey, guys.
-All right, here she comes.

550
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,949
-We're telling her.
-That her mom is cheating on her dad...

551
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,328
-With a lesbian woman. Right.
-...who is not her father.

552
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,747
So how was your big adventure
in New York City?

553
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,040
Anything crazy happen?

554
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,710
Oh, um... [clears throat]
Do you want to tell her, Andrew, or...?

555
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,630
No, I think you're better at opening
your mouth and saying things.

556
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,381
-Why don't you do the telling?
-Okay.

557
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,717
Well... [clears throat]
Jessi...

558
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,927
-What?
-Um...

559
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,429
-Jessi... [clears throat]
-Guys, what is it?

560
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,805
-Well...
-We saw--

561
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,434
There is someone out there
cross-breeding dolphins with poodles.

562
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,894
-I'm not following.
-A dolphoodle!

563
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,938
-Its name is Kevin.
-And he eats fingers...

564
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,106
-He thinks they're baby corn. Yes.
-They're baby corn.

565
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,859
Eww. People are sick.
I'm glad I didn't go with you.

566
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,903
Yeah, me too,

567
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,531
'cause we saw some things
you wouldn't have wanted to see.

568
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,700
All right, well,  hasta la vista.

569
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,119
I blacked out. Did we tell her?

570
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,706
-Jesus, Andrew, we blew it.
-I'm sorry, I couldn't do it.

571
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,750
-What couldn't you do?
-Oh, nothing.

572
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,961
-What's your problem?
-Whoo!

573
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,921
My dick is on fire.

574
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,297
-Wanna know why?
-No, I do not.

575
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,757
-I'm fucking my bath mat.
-What?
