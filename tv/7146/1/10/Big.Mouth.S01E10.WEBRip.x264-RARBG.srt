1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,175
[Nick] All right, let's see.
How does this thing work?

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,302
Let me just get... [grunts]

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,595
Yeah, got it.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,640
Finally. Now we can watch our first porn.

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,018
[sobbing] Missy!

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,521
I'll never love anyone again,
and no one will ever love me.

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,275
Ohh, Andrew, you know
I really don't like seeing weakness.

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,193
- [sobs] I'm not crying.
- Uh-huh.

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,655
Maybe if I die, she'll feel bad
and take me back.

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,743
Good idea. Or we could watch
the Sylvester Stallone porn.

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,202
" The Italian Stallion,

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,164
the story of two young lovers
beefing in a gross motel."

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:43,376
Two young lovers?
Oh, Missy, why did you break up with us?

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,753
Goddamn it.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,504
Well, well, well, a hole.

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,175
[gasps] Ooh! And crotch level, no less.
Mmm, yes, please.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,179
All right, once I press play,
our lives will be changed forever.

18
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,765
I literally do not care about anything.

19
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,934
Hey, before we start, I want you boys
to meet my fiancÃ©e, Candice.

20
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,603
She's absolutely perfect.

21
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,647
I mean, the only downside
is the dick splinters.

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,108
[music playing]

23
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,819
Hey, Kitty, you wanna hop
on this stallion or what?

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,656
- Sure, but I only ride bareback.
- Oh, yeah, great.

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,283
- Hoo hoo!
- Whoa...

26
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,328
Oh, yes. Oh, this is great.
You're great.

27
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,871
- [Kitty]  Is it great?
- [Stallone]  Oh, that's great.

28
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,915
Hey, Kitty, you gotta do one thing for me.

29
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,209
- [Kitty]  What?
-  Stroke the shaft, cup the balls.

30
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,960
- Whoa...
- [grunting and moaning]

31
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,422
Adrian!

32
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:07,335
All right. Wrestling is apparently
not what we're doing here today.

33
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,921
It's a field trip
to the police department.

34
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,132
Matthew, you clearly lied to me.

35
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,844
The man rode on a bus for 20 minutes
in a wrestling singlet

36
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,345
and didn't ask a single question.

37
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,806
I don't think I can keep my balls
to one side.

38
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,599
I really think I'm gonna have
to spread 'em.

39
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,269
All right, kids. Welcome
to the Bridgeton Police Department.

40
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,687
Yes, son. Do you have a question?

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,481
Oh. Nah. I just keep my hands up
in a police station.

42
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,025
- You know, 'cause, uh, duh.
- That's a good call.

43
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,778
Hey, guys. Check it out, my first zit.

44
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,739
I guess watching  The Italian Stallion
knocked something loose...

45
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,074
[chuckles] you know, manhood-wise.

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,868
Oh, please. You call that a zit?

47
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,954
My crackne's so bad
I take Ortho Tri-Cyclen,

48
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,665
which is basically birth control.
Ha ha!

49
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,834
Up top. No? Fuck you, guys.

50
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,588
All right, everyone, file in.
This is our line up room.

51
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,464
That's one of those
two-way mirrors, right?

52
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,009
So I can see them and they can see me?

53
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,553
You are thinking of a window,
you orangutan.

54
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,221
Matthew, cutting deep.

55
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,142
- Oh, hi-- hi, Andrew.
- Oh. Hi, Missy.

56
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,519
Okay, kids, let's see those profiles.

57
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,148
I was, um, just hoping that, um,
maybe we could be friends?

58
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:15,361
Oh, Missy, I can't be your friend
and just pretend I don't love you.

59
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,698
And then what? Someday I get
an invitation to your wedding,

60
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,409
and I watch you marry a guy named Joel.

61
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,161
What do you see in Joel?

62
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,413
I guess he's an architect.
He's a good man.

63
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,540
Missy, I'm happy for you.

64
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,294
Sarge, we just found another dead body
with their ponytail cut off.

65
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,588
- The Ponytail Killer strikes again.
- Damn it!

66
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,381
Hold on. Is that what we're calling him?

67
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,259
'Cause I thought we were going
with the Ponytail Prowler?

68
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,387
- Why prowler? He's not a cat burglar.
- I like alliteration.

69
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,140
How about Ponytail, uh... Person?

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,100
That's nothing. That's a nothing nickname.

71
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,144
Enough! Women are dying!

72
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,105
Now I want a catchy nickname on my desk
by the end of the day.

73
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,193
So this is our crime lab.
It's where we analyze genetic evidence.

74
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,527
Can I have a volunteer?

75
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,447
How about you,
the child with the puffy lifeless eyes.

76
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,367
Your results might be tainted
because I'm empty inside.

77
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,578
You guys realize DNA is a hoax
created by gay scientists, right?

78
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,664
[groans] Stop quoting
your dad's law commercials.

79
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,541
- Oh, yeah? Maybe I will stop.
- Don't you dare.

80
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,466
- Oh, yeah, my mouth is sopping wet.
- No, no, don't talk, don't talk.

81
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,180
Hey, that's the old pet cemetery
where my dad is buried.

82
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
Whoa!

83
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,269
That's Carole from my Curves gym
who yells at me for not being female.

84
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,772
And that's the bus driver
with the pretty, pretty ponytail.

85
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,440
What a coinkydink.

86
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,485
Sir, if you don't mind,
we'd like to ask you a few questions.

87
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,696
Me? A legit hang sesh?

88
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,240
Spoiler alert, I'm your guy.

89
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,575
Yeah, you just might be.

90
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,036
- Wait, wait.
- What?

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,581
Hey, I'm not complaining or anything,
but why do you keep kissing me?

92
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,251
I'm just acting out because my parents
are getting divorced. Don't stop.

93
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,672
- Got it. But I crave emotional intimacy.
- Oh, boy.

94
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,425
Because my parents
have a no-touch policy with me.

95
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,969
So I don't really feel
human contact at all.

96
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,013
- Oh, God.
- Unless I trick people into touching me,

97
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,432
like, by pretending
to be falling down or something.

98
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,476
- What?
- I think I want more of a relationship.

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,186
- Does that sound gay?
- Um...

100
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,397
Baby, you gotta throw this boy a bone.

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,859
Anything to make him start
frenching you again.

102
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,529
- [groans] Fine. One date.
- Yes! Fuck yeah!

103
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,698
Now smooch up on him.

104
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,455
Oh, look at those adorable little fingers.
I can't stand being so close to her.

105
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,373
You know what might make you feel better?

106
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,876
Going home and watching porn again?

107
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,795
Ah, yes.
The student has become the master.

108
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,422
Oh, that would make a pretty good porn.

109
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,841
Hey, Andrew, who's that, like, creature
you're friends with?

110
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,134
The-- the puberty guy?

111
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,886
- The hormone monster?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,638
Now that I have this zit,
I feel like we should have a chat.

113
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,724
- He wants to talk to you.
- [groans]

114
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,852
So, what makes you think
you'd be a good candidate for puberty?

115
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,605
Well, I'm almost 13,
I have kissed two girls,

116
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,941
and, of course... [chuckles]
the old Yellowstone Caldera here.

117
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,901
Nice callback.

118
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,362
So I know you, uh, recently watched
The Italian Stallion.

119
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,614
Did you cum?

120
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,282
Oh, yeah. Big time.

121
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,825
Oh, yeah? And what did that feel like?

122
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,828
Like puncturing a Capri Sun
on the first try?

123
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,289
[chuckles] Okay. I think we're done here.

124
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,458
Give me a call in, like,
I don't know, two years.

125
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,295
- Oh, come on, please. What about the zit?
- Oh, right. Yeah, let me see that.

126
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,422
- Ow!
- Look, your zit just came

127
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,966
- more than you ever have. [laughs]
- [groans]

128
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,718
He was totally unreasonable

129
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,013
and  he was, like, eating pistachios
the whole time, which felt rude.

130
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,599
Yeah, he loves pistachios.
I mean, he's a weird guy.

131
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,642
So I gotta go.

132
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,268
Hold on. Aren't you coming over?

133
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,315
No, I have plans. I'm-- I'm going
to my, um, aunt's wedding.

134
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,775
Your aunt's getting married on a Thursday?

135
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,527
Yeah, she's cheap. Cheap lady.

136
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,695
- Okay, let's hang out tomorrow.
- Okay.

137
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,447
Nice lie, baby.

138
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,867
I mean, the kid had no idea
that your aunt died years ago

139
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:54,205
after a slow miserable battle
with cancer. Ha ha! Idiot.

140
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,209
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

141
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,629
What? We're gonna watch the porn,
so I can forget about Missy.

142
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,797
The same one?

143
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,549
Oh, my little sweet potato,

144
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,135
there's a whole world of pornography
out there.

145
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,011
In fact, you can trace erotica

146
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,014
all the way back
to the early Paleolithic cave drawings.

147
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,058
- Whoa.
- What's your safe word again?

148
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,853
Honestly, I'm embarrassed,
but it's "ooga-booga."

149
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,023
In the third century, the Kama Sutra
became the standard go-to jerk work.

150
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,941
[Andrew] Wow.

151
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,819
Sorry, can you just shift a little bit?
My leg is cramping.

152
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,780
You're cramping? I'm upside fucking down.

153
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,198
Very well-researched.

154
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,244
Video changed the game,
and for a while flicks helped us fap.

155
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,289
Did someone order a pizza?
'Cause I already ate it.

156
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,208
Jesus, Ron, are you gonna
burp into my pussy again?

157
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,836
Why would that guy be in a...
Oh, it's quite big.

158
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,006
And, finally, the mother
of all pornovations...

159
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,466
the internet.

160
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,969
Everything you could ever want,
whenever you want it.

161
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,391
Amazing. Oh, but this site says
I need to be 18.

162
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,729
I think we're gonna be okay, Andrew.
I'm 75 million years old.

163
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,606
- [moaning]
- Whoa.

164
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,816
[moaning]

165
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,319
- Hi, Andrew. I like your fedora.
- Missy.

166
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,403
Hi, hi.

167
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,989
It's really nice being alone with you.

168
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,908
Andrew, we need to break up.

169
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
[grunts]

170
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,620
I want you, Andrew.

171
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,705
- Welcome to jazz club.
- [woman]  Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,373
See you at school tomorrow.

173
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,875
Seven minutes of--

174
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,127
[moaning and panting]

175
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,712
[alarm clock buzzing]

176
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:29,300
- [man]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- [woman moaning]

177
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,468
[sighs]

178
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,720
- Oh, boy, what a night.
- [alarm stops]

179
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,847
- When did you finally go to sleep?
- I didn't.

180
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,975
Oh. Mature group pissing?

181
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,270
I guess I just got a little bored
of the solo pissing stuff.

182
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,689
- Uh-huh. Sure, okay.
- All right.

183
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,443
I guess I should go to school,
even though there's no porn there.

184
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

185
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,365
You can't leave your room like this.
Your mom will mature piss herself.

186
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,158
Oh, yeah, yeah. Good call.

187
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,910
I'm gonna toss all these
in the kitchen garbage.

188
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,080
Are you crazy?
You gotta go offsite with this biohazard.

189
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,665
- [shattering]
- Oh, boy.

190
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,833
The synagogue, huh?

191
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,379
I guess the smell of pickled herring
will hide the scent of your seed.

192
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,465
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- You're very smart.

193
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,511
And chemical bonds that exist
between two atoms that share electrons

194
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,515
- are called covalent bonds.
- [tapping on chalkboard]

195
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,933
- Andrew.
- Huh? What?

196
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,270
Can you give us an example of a molecule
with a covalent bond?

197
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,605
Um... a big molecule?

198
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,399
You haven't been listening at all,
have you?

199
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,527
You're being very, very bad.

200
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,407
Do you need to be punished, Andrew?

201
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,536
Oh, I need to be punished
'cause I'm a bad little baby.

202
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,789
Why don't you bend me over that desk
and spank me on the ass?

203
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,124
Excuse me, Mr. Glouberman?

204
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,166
Oh, hi.

205
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,003
He wants you to spank him on his ass
as if he were a baby,

206
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,255
even though he's not actually a baby.

207
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,382
But he wants it over the desk
because he's a bad little bitch.

208
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,219
All right, so where were you
on the night of August 21?

209
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,055
Let's see. I was home by myself.

210
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,268
- What about September 11th?
- Oh, my birthday. I was home alone.

211
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,436
September 28th?

212
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,938
I was watching  Home Alone
at home, alone.

213
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,400
Sir, I gotta tell you,
based on your lack of alibi

214
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,902
and your various connections
to the victims,

215
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,363
you are currently a person of interest.

216
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,865
So let me get this straight:

217
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,285
you think that I am interesting
and also a person?

218
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:24,957
You're the person, Steve.
You have the right to remain awesome.

219
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,294
- Hey, Andrew.
- What, Missy?

220
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,631
Oh, well, I just saw what happened
in Science class.

221
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,965
Is-- is everything okay, Andrew?

222
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,259
Yep. Hunky-dory. Okay, bye.

223
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,469
We're going to my house, right?

224
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,180
No, I gotta go home to the baseball game.

225
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,598
- What?
- With my aunt.

226
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,267
Why is your aunt going to a baseball game
the day after her wedding?

227
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,728
I don't know, Nick.
Why would you suck on a strap-on?

228
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,023
The thing's made of plastic.
Who benefits from that? I have to go.

229
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,399
What's going on with Andrew?

230
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,527
I don't know, Missy,
but I'm pretty sure it's your fault.

231
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,613
Oh, no. I don't doubt it.

232
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,365
[panting]

233
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,532
All right.

234
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,494
No. What the hell? The Wi-Fi is out.

235
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,289
No big deal. We don't need porn.
Let's just use our imaginations.

236
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,166
You remember what tits look like, right?

237
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,544
They're like... like, like round boxes.

238
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,091
- Why doesn't anything in this house work?
- Yeah. Why doesn't anything work?

239
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,676
- What are you talking about?
- This house sucks.

240
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,221
- Yeah, it does suck.
- Why is it my fault?

241
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,931
[yells]

242
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,475
You know who's funny?  The Big Bang Theory.

243
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,479
May I offer you a beverage? Ta-da!

244
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,148
Why isn't your magic
as annoying as it used to be?

245
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,360
'Cause he looks like a sexy porcupine.

246
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,071
You know, my dad called your dad
about being his divorce lawyer.

247
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,741
Oh, boy. Guy Bilzerian
is gonna destroy your mom.

248
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,867
She deserves it.

249
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,079
My dad's living in the basement.
There's no bathroom down there.

250
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,581
He has to shower in the backyard.
It's so sad.

251
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,084
My dad has a shower in his office.

252
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,670
He and his receptionist
both have robes there.

253
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,672
Your dad is screwing his receptionist?

254
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,507
Oh, I never thought of it like that.

255
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,050
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck.

256
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,260
Both our houses suck.

257
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,971
Yeah. But spending time with you
doesn't suck.

258
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,180
Aww.

259
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,390
[man] Oh, no.

260
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,642
[heavy breathing]

261
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,396
Ponytail.

262
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,318
[doorbell ringing]

263
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,822
Oh, Andrew. Are you sick?
Have you lost a lot of fluids?

264
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,157
No, Mrs. Birch. I'm fine.

265
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,160
He's not fine.
A cardiologist knows a broken heart.

266
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,288
- Aww, you poor baby.
- And there's only one cure.

267
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,541
A hug from your friend's father
while he holds a magazine.

268
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,835
I thought you were going
to a baseball game with your aunt?

269
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,171
Oh. Um, a foul ball hit her in the face,

270
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,964
- so she died in 2011.
- What?

271
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,175
Can I use your bathroom?
Does your bathroom have a lock?

272
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,594
- You wanna use it right now?
- Oh, and what's your Wi-Fi password?

273
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,929
Oh, that's "WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN,"
all caps.

274
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,433
- I gotta go.
- Have fun surfing the web. [chuckles]

275
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,729
Oh, Andrew, you make me feel so good.

276
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,647
So can you take your clothes off?

277
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,358
But you must go
to my Amazon wish list first

278
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,861
and buy me mini fridge.

279
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,530
You'll take off your clothes
if I buy you a mini fridge?

280
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,910
[Svetlana]  Yes. I'm so hot,
but I must be made cold.

281
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,994
- [knock on door]
- [muffled gasp]

282
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,747
Andrew, you okay? Who are you talking to?

283
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,081
[Andrew] Occupied.

284
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,043
Hey, sweetheart,
you need to take a break from pornography.

285
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,837
What? Are you kidding?
I thought you were a hormone monster.

286
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,923
Hey, you know I'm all about
jacking that stack,

287
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,384
living that horndog life, whoop-whoop!
But this is pure compulsion.

288
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,095
You've taken something beautiful
and made it ugly.

289
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,972
Well, then get lost, Maury.

290
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,307
Wow, that's cold.

291
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,850
[sighs] Goodbye, kiddo.

292
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,435
Whoop-whoop.

293
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,937
And then, after all those lies,

294
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,397
he comes over and locks himself
in the bathroom.

295
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,485
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It's as clear as day. He's doing smack.

296
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,278
I don't know.
That doesn't sound like Andrew.

297
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,031
My friend Booger Wheeler
got left by a lady.

298
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,325
Sent him straight to the needle.
[chortles]

299
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,454
âª And he died with his eyes open wide âª

300
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,373
So, what are you saying? It's hopeless?

301
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,792
No. Go save your friend.

302
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,170
Kick down the door, grab his drugs
and bring him up here.

303
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,800
âª And don't forget to bring a spoon âª

304
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,887
- [man]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- [moaning and panting]

305
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,640
Oh, Andrew. Hey, great.

306
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,599
Whoa, what the--?

307
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,102
-  Why don't you come in here, join us?
-  Me?

308
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,396
Yeah, you. Could it be? Don't know.

309
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,482
Adrian, you stole a cookie
from the cookie jar.

310
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,609
- Uh, I'm Andrew.
-  Yeah, this is Cookie.

311
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,610
My name's Kitty.

312
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,738
Hey, and I'm great. Come on in, buddy.
Yeah, through the screen.

313
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,157
- What? Come in?
-  That's it. Closer.

314
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,202
Okay, I don't know why I trust you,
but I-- whoa!

315
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,832
Andrew, open up. Put down the needle.

316
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,250
[grunting]

317
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,877
- Andrew?
- He's gone.

318
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,880
- Did he OD on heroin?
- Heroin? No.

319
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,590
He's addicted to pornography.

320
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:47,094
Nick, Andrew has been sucked
into the PornScape.

321
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,512
The what?

322
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:53,017
An alternate dimension
where pornography comes to life.

323
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,518
PornScape.

324
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,854
- [man]  Oh, yeah.
- [Nick] Oh, God.

325
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,938
-  Oh, yeah.
-  Andrew!

326
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,232
If we don't get him out
of the PornScape soon,

327
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,111
he'll never be able to connect to anyone
on an emotional or sexual level.

328
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,654
- Take my hand, Ned.
- It's Nick.

329
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,072
Yeah, that's what I said.

330
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,450
- Just squeeze a little bit. No.
- Okay. I'm a little...

331
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,994
Sorry, can you just shift a little?
My leg is cramping.

332
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,332
Oh,  you're  cramping?
I'm upside fucking down.

333
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,127
Ugh! The synagogue
where Cantor Dina works.

334
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,004
I just wanna, like, do something to it.

335
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,839
Let's throw a brick through a window.

336
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,008
Um, of the synagogue?
That's a little hate crimey, Jay.

337
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:31,639
What if we let it be known
that Cantor Dina, as a snack,

338
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,932
eats little pieces of shit?

339
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,767
Why is that your go-to thing?

340
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,101
- [thump]
- What's that?

341
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,312
- [meowing]
- Aww.

342
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,689
What's wrong, buddy? What's in there?

343
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,317
[screaming]

344
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,319
- [Jay] Holy shit!
- [Jessi] Oh, my God! There's a dead body!

345
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,821
- Will you be my girlfriend?
- What? This is not the time!

346
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,531
- Then when is?
- Not now!

347
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,284
- I'm in love with you, Jessi!
- [screaming]

348
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,247
- Whoa. The Italian Stallion?
- Hey, great.

349
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,375
We're looking for Andrew.
Have you seen him?

350
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,919
Pear-shaped, glasses,
smells like cold pasta.

351
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,922
Oh, yeah. I thought his name was Adrian.

352
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,758
He's the king.
'Cause, you know, he's a good king.

353
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,012
- Yeah, well, we need to talk to him.
- Oh, you don't talk, though, you listen.

354
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,098
You know, in here,
we're all his children, right?

355
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,100
- I mean, the guy is a sex god.
- [Nick] Huh.

356
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,852
- Do you know how to find him?
- Yeah, he's up the River Dicks.

357
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,063
I'll take you there,
and this hairy guy too.

358
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,692
Get over here. Give me a kiss.
Get the fuck outta here. Let's go.

359
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,321
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- [moans]

360
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,615
What is this place?

361
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,784
What you're seeing
is Andrew's search history.

362
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,203
Everything he watched, you know,
come to life.

363
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,040
Hey, great.
It's Mickey, Paulie, and all the gals.

364
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,458
This is my fault.

365
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,169
I never should've forced Andrew
to watch  The Italian Stallion.

366
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,630
Uh... maybe I had something to do with it,

367
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,590
you know, ravaging him
with puberty and all.

368
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,093
Speaking of, when are you
gonna ravage me with puberty?

369
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,512
Oh, this again. You're just not ready.

370
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,598
Then why did you bring me along
to this porn world?

371
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,267
It's called the PornScape.

372
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,352
It's a cool name. Please use it.

373
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,396
I brought you to the PornScape

374
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,732
because Andrew listens to you.
He respects you.

375
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,151
Hey, no offense, but we're here.

376
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,990
- But where's Andrew?
- Adrian? Hey, king's in there.

377
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:13,949
[hormone monster] Whoa.

378
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,078
It's the heart from the science museum
where I skullfucked Garrison Keillor.

379
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,081
Andrew and Missy almost kissed there,
but that's not relevant.

380
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,249
All you need to know

381
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,793
is that I put my penis
in Garrison Keillor's skull.

382
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,214
- [muffled shout]
- Aah!

383
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,508
- Sorry. You can't go in there.
- [Andrew] Ah-pah-pah!

384
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,343
Bring them to me.

385
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,893
- Oh, Andrew. Jesus Christ.
- [bleating]

386
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,854
- Whoa, great jack shack, man.
- What's that shirt?

387
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,689
My porn shirt?

388
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,610
It's from my Dracula costume
from two years ago. Halloween.

389
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,654
- What brings you travelers here?
- Uh-huh. We're here to save you.

390
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,323
I choose not to be saved.

391
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,243
Yes, he wants to stay
and buy me mini dishwasher.

392
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,371
Small, but can fit big plates.

393
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,165
You know, you haven't taken
anything off yet.

394
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,875
Andrew, this isn't who you are.

395
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,419
You're not a sex freak.
You're a sweet guy.

396
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,755
You don't like all of this.
You like Missy.

397
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,673
- [groans]
- [rumbling]

398
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,637
No. It hurts too much out there.
Nobody can hurt me in here.

399
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,721
But this isn't real.

400
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,390
- It is to me, Nick. It is--
- [smacking]

401
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,810
Will you stop spanking him
for five seconds while I'm talking?

402
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,727
Uh, sorry, boss.

403
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,813
Okay, fine. Let's do this.

404
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,481
If you won't leave, I won't either.

405
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,275
I'll throw away my life
and be a part of your crazy porn world.

406
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,196
Scape. It's a PornScape.
Why is this so hard for you?

407
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,907
Whatever. PornScape. Sign me up.

408
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,160
I'll jack off that guy
and rim job that girl,

409
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,745
and eat everyone's ass out.

410
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,997
- That's what a rim job is, Nick.
- Exactly.

411
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,958
The rim of his anus.
It couldn't be more clear.

412
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,501
You see what I'm dealing with here,
Andrew?

413
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,086
Oh, fine. Who cares?

414
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,004
Come and get me, you freaks.

415
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,340
Yeah. Okay.

416
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,925
[shudders] Uh-oh.

417
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,928
Uh, Andrew, we need to get this kid
outta here, like, right now.

418
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,557
He's gonna get molested
and I don't mean fun babysitter molested.

419
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,809
- Andrew?
- [Svetlana] I want you.

420
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,726
No!

421
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,355
Hey, leave him alone.
He's not ready for any of this.

422
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,941
Maurice, let's get out of here.

423
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,651
- [panting]
- Oh, shit.

424
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,571
These horny fucks are so fast.

425
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,531
[bleating]

426
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,660
[panting] Oh, I'm out of shape.
I gotta smoke less.

427
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,708
Hey, you ain't leaving with our king.
I mean, the king's great.

428
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,044
Boys, take the boat and go on without me.
I'll hold off the Stallion.

429
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,965
- But, Maury, we can't leave you.
- Go, boys. Go, now!

430
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,301
Let's see what you got, you juiced pig.

431
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,138
Hey, this isn't great.

432
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,766
[moaning and grunting]

433
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,227
Cowabunga!

434
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,397
This is great!

435
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,065
[monster groaning]

436
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,901
Oh. I feel bad for him.

437
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:59,156
No. He's told me many times
this is exactly how he wanted to go.

438
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,284
- Andrew, wait!
- Missy?

439
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,661
- What are you doing here?
- I-- I came to find you.

440
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,080
- Guys, we gotta get out of here.
- We can be happy here.

441
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,333
- I wanna get back together with you.
- Really?

442
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,418
Andrew, you can't stay here with Missy.

443
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,962
Oh.

444
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,381
- That's not really Missy.
- How do you know?

445
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,385
[sighs] Because the real Missy
doesn't want to be with me.

446
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,471
Also, look at her feet.
She got those dildo feet.

447
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,473
- Okay, let's go.
- Well, you know what, Andrew?

448
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,309
[voice distorts]
You aren't going anywhere.

449
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,852
[roaring]

450
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,024
[screaming]

451
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,819
[groans]

452
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,821
- Oh, God, we made it.
- [sighs]

453
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,156
I don't know if you noticed,

454
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,159
but, Nick, I've got a real problem
with the pornography.

455
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,163
Yeah. Some old people pissed on us,
and it smelled different.

456
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,207
My guess is
it's all the vitamins they take.

457
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,541
It's all the supplements, yeah.

458
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,045
Then we heard a noise, and me
and my very serious girlfriend, Jessi,

459
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,047
opened the lid and saw a dead body.

460
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,967
- And, uh, you're the girlfriend?
- Uh, not exactly.

461
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,593
Then what is this guy to you?

462
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,387
You're going steady? You pinned her?

463
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,139
- Yeah. What am I to you?
- You're a guy that I kiss sometimes.

464
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,058
That's nothing.
That's a nothing relationship.

465
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:08,976
Women are dying!

466
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,396
So I want you to define your relationship
by the end of the night.

467
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,107
That noise they heard must have been
our guy dumping the victim.

468
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,776
All the while
we got Coach Steve in custody,

469
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:22,114
which means, gentlemen,
that he cannot be Jon Bon Ponytail.

470
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,449
You stop trying to make that work!

471
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,785
- Sir, you're free to go.
- [chuckles]

472
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,620
But am I free to stay, my friend?

473
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,664
That don't make no never mind to me.

474
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,625
- Well, I guess we should go home.
- Ugh.

475
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,295
- I don't wanna go home.
- Yeah, me neither.

476
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,838
The dogs probably ate my dinner by now.

477
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,339
What if we don't go home?

478
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,757
You mean, like, go to a movie,

479
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,426
or sneak into the cemetery
and sleep there?

480
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,928
- No.
- I know a pretty empty mausoleum.

481
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,513
I mean, like, get out of here.

482
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,391
Run, child. Run away to Mexico.

483
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,559
We'll live on the beach

484
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,103
and get those weird little braidy things
in our hair.

485
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,147
Let's go somewhere far away.

486
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,732
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

487
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,984
Because I am a hundred percent
on board for this.

488
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,111
I have a go-bag right here.

489
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,363
Okay, we need to run
before I change my mind. Let's go.

490
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,116
It's just all loose tortilla chips.

491
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,410
[monster] Hello, Nick.

492
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,997
- [groaning]
- Are you all right? How'd you get out?

493
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,041
- I fucking fucked all those fucks.
- Yeah.

494
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,293
On that note, I think you were right.

495
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,462
I'm not ready for puberty. I'm gonna wait.

496
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,964
Oh, no, no, Nick. It's not your decision.

497
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,008
In fact, check your mons.

498
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,843
- Hey, Nick.
- What it do?

499
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,678
We are your curly new pals.

500
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,139
Are we in Tampa?
'Cause it's hot and stinky.

501
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,475
- I don't wanna be here.
- No, we're not in Tampa.

502
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,351
We're in Crotch City, USA.

503
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,478
Hi, guys.

504
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,104
Does this mean I'm going through puberty?

505
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,900
- Are you gonna be my hormone monster?
- Uh, no, not exactly.

506
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,110
You'll be working with my friend Rick.
Great guy.

507
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,404
- Where is he? Where's the kid?
- What?

508
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,366
He can't even see me.
And there's shit running down his leg.

509
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,163
- We're gonna have a lot of fun, man.
- No, no. I don't accept this.

510
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,917
I'm gonna have my mom call a doctor.
There's gotta be a shot I can take, right?

511
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,920
You want me to teach you
how to masturbate?

512
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,714
[sighs]

513
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,883
Well, one door closes,

514
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,094
and another opens.

515
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,513
- [screams]
- Get down on the ground, you sick fuck!

516
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,890
- Oh, my God, what's happening?
- You're under arrest.

517
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,475
What are you doing to my boy?

518
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,560
I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings,

519
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,604
but your boy here
is a perverted killer, ma'am.

520
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,563
I knew it!

521
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:23,318
His DNA was found all over a dead body
in the synagogue dumpster. All over.

522
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,778
[gasps] My jizz socks.

523
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,614
There was so much semen,
at first we thought a horse had done it.

524
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,991
I know who you are, you little bastard.

525
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,494
You're the ponytail something.

526
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,496
Guys, please, I'm just some weird kid.

527
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,706
- Detective, check this out.
- Who's this?

528
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,751
- Your next victim?
- That's my associate Susan.

529
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,670
And what the hell is this here now?

530
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,422
That's not mine.
That's the hormone monster's.

531
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,883
Oh, my God. My son is deranged.

532
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,302
Let me guess, the monster did this too.

533
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,390
Yes. He wanted to climax in my wall.
Why am I saying all of this?

534
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:58,353
Andrew, my son, I can't believe
you made a hole in my drywall.

535
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,064
- Officers, take him away.
- No, guys. Ow, ow!

536
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,902
I'm gonna have to go
to Home Depot on a Sunday.

537
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,822
Why, Andrew? Why?

538
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,157
[cell door rattling]

539
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,908
Hey. How you doing, buddy?

540
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,827
I'm terrified, Nick.

541
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,664
My cellmate called me a pretty shit today.
It's a real mixed message.

542
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,084
[grunts] I think we need
to start accepting and enjoying.

543
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,879
Don't worry, we'll get you out of here.
You're innocent.

544
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,213
You are innocent, right?

545
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,800
'Cause your DNA was found,
like, all over the body.

546
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,885
Under the eyelids--

547
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,553
Nick, of course I'm innocent.

548
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:35,098
They're saying I'm a serial killer,
but I'm just a chronic masturbator.

549
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,101
Stop quoting  my  law commercials.

550
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,187
Guy Bilzerian? What are you doing here?

551
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,523
I'm your fucking lawyer,
and you're fucking going home, fucknuts.

552
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,441
I am?

553
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,567
The good news is,

554
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,527
there's security footage
of the real killer

555
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,738
throwing the body
in the synagogue dumpster.

556
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,114
Oh, thank God.

557
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,407
The bad news is,

558
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,077
there's also footage of you
tossing dozens of jizz-soaked socks

559
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,579
in the same dumpster.

560
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,706
And it's gone viral.

561
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,211
- And this is where you fart?
- Yup.

562
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,837
And this is where I picked my nose.

563
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,464
- [Nick laughs]
- [Andrew groans]

564
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,007
How will I face the kids at school?

565
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,801
Look, I know this all seems
embarrassing now, boys,

566
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,722
but maybe one day
you'll look back on this time fondly.

567
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,350
And perhaps even make
something beautiful out of it.

568
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,770
What? Like a show
about a bunch of kids masturbating?

569
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,314
Isn't that basically
just like child pornography?

570
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,233
Holy shit. I hope not.

571
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,110
I mean, maybe if it's animated,
we can get away with it.

572
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,820
Right?

573
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,495
[horn honks]

574
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,207
Y'all can hop in the back,
just shove that shit to the side.

575
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,833
- Oh, thanks.
- Thank you.

576
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,629
Pam? Scorpion?

577
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,923
Jay, who are these pillows?

578
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,009
We're his family.
Who the fuck are you, bitch?

579
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,970
[groans] This is awkward.
