Either way...

750
00:47:32,794 --> 00:47:35,154

751
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:50,872
You don't consider this

752
00:47:50,873 --> 00:47:52,952
to have moved beyond the parameters

753
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,472
of what you were sent up there to achieve?

754
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:57,912
If this person was working as an undercover officer

755
00:47:57,913 --> 00:47:59,152
during that time,

756
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:01,272
then presumably all he was doing

was the task assigned to him, Kevin,

be dragged into an active investigation.

to speak to some senior officers,

That looks like Raggett.

Bill Raggett. We were in Special Operations together
Bill Raggett 我们一起在90年代的"特别行动"里

Another couple of weeks, I reckon.

Then it would have been much too late for you.

777
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:34,391
Ask your questions, Inspector.

..is a dead child from Peterborough, I think.

785
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:13,271
That's how it worked.
就是那样运作的

786
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:18,030
We'd squat in the identities of dead kids.
我们使用死去的孩子的身份

787
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:19,270
Who's "we"?
"我们"是谁

788
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:21,789
"We", in our case,

00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,790
My idea, as it happens.

798
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,709
You haven't been asked to testify to the inquiry?

799
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,189
Why would I?

800
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,990
I ain't done nothing wrong.

801
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,749
I did the job that was asked of me,

802

behaved myself,

803
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,950
came home.

804
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,110
Culture and standards change.

805
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,190
And I'm glad that they do.

806
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:11,549
But I will not be publicly dragged onto the altar

807
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,749
of hand-wringing virtue signallers.

808
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:19,269
I did my job.

809

I think one of your team might have done something wrong.

How would that even work?

00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,508
Why didn't your unit extract them, pull 'em back in?
