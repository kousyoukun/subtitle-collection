MUSIC: "Sull'aria" from
"The Marriage Of Figaro" by Mozart

2
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,920
Stop!

3
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,840
Help! Help! Is he still alive?

4
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, yes. Cut the engine
and get out of the car, please.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,920
TURNS ENGINE OFF, MUSIC STOPS

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,160
GUNSHOT

7
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,680
Good morning, Judge Bertolini!

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
How are you? What do you want?
Oh, you don't remember me(?)

9
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
But then, you must send a lot
of innocent people to prison.

10
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,240
I suppose, after a while,
we all just...blur into one.

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,760
Tito Spadola.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,360
S-P-A-D-O-L-A.

13
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,480
22nd January, 1994,

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,680
Milan Central Court,

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,440
life imprisonment, for murder.
Anything? Vaguely?

16
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,960
I remember.

17
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,800
Oh, good. Because it's important
you know why I'm going to kill you.

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,360
No, please, please... I told you to
your face, I didn't kill that kid.

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,960
But you didn't believe me. I told
you the cops fixed the evidence,
but you just looked at your watch.

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,800
I told you the witnesses were
lying on the stand, you just smiled.

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,440
You stole my whole life
and thought it was funny.

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,720
Well, now I'm taking yours in
return. For God's sake, I beg you...

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,840
But please, don't feel persecuted.

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,520
I'll be seeing Arcuti tomorrow,
and Zen the day after.

25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
Say "hello" from Tito Spadola.

26
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,760
Papa!

27
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,640
GUNSHOT

28
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,120
Ah, come on, Aurelio.
You know it's always on the house.

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
See you tomorrow.

30
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,920
Ms Moretti. Hi, Detective.

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
Thanks.

32
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,960
ELECTRONIC CHIME, DOORS OPEN

33
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,520
Thanks.

34
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,400
HE SIGHS

35
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,600
Tania.

36
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,040
Aurelio.

37
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,280
Hello, Giorgio.
How was your weekend?

38
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,600
Great, thanks. How was yours?
Hey, boys, boys.

39
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Listen, Moscati's new secretary,
Tania Moretti.

40
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,400
Yeah, what about her?
All the boys in the Murder Squad
are putting in 20 euros each,

41
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,200
and the first one to bed her gets
the lot. If you fancy your chances,
I'm holding the pot.

42
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,840
Alternatively, I'll give you odds
on anyone in the building.

43
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,600
Isn't she married? That's what
I heard. Boys, 80% of extra-marital
affairs start in the workplace.

44
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
Only fair to warn you
that Vincenzo Fabri's in,

45
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,480
and as you know, his record with
the girls here is second to none -
despite being married.

46
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,120
I heard a rumour she's sleeping
with him already.

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Fabri?

48
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,320
Really? I bet you Romizi knows as
well, that's why he's taking bets.
Aurelio!

49
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,560
And you can get your arse
off that desk,

50
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
and I don't care who your uncle is.

51
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,480
I need a car.

52
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,240
So? Phone call from the ministry.
He's not happy. Thanks.

53
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,640
We've been summoned by the ministry.

54
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,440
Your pre-trial review of
the Faso investigation, the minister
wants to hear it for himself.

55
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
What? It had better be finished.

56
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,400
More or less.
"More or less"?! Dear God.

57
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,960
I hope you found the police work
down in Abruzzo was perfect
in every respect.

58
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,040
Erm. What does that mean - "erm"?

59
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,920
Look, they got the guy
and, um, he confessed.

60
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,800
But...between you and me,
it was a bit, um, slothful.

61
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,640
"Slothful"? Negligent. Lax.

62
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,760
Naturally, there's no mention
of any of this in your review?

63
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,520
Well, like I said, you know,
they got the guy.

64
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,480
I don't like this.
There's something going on.

65
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,800
They're just dying for a reason
to cut our budget this year.

66
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,520
Don't give them one.

67
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,960
You're watching
a tape of billionaire
construction magnate Oscar Faso

68
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,360
in the living room of his
mountain retreat in Abruzzo.

69
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,040
Seems Faso was in
the habit of secretly recording
all his assignations with women.

70
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,040
In this case, two...
prostitutes from Naples.

71
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,040
Now, the video clearly shows
the killing of Faso, and the girls,
but not who killed them.

72
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,920
GUNSHOTS, SCREAMING

73
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,640
Now, this next shot
is from the security cameras, which
cover the outside of the property.

74
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,120
This is Renato Favelloni,

75
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,680
the only other guest that evening,
and the man who later confessed

76
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,720
to the killings, leaving
the building some 60 seconds later.

77
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,040
Now miraculously, despite the fact
that he was covered in blood,

78
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,400
only half-dressed and out of his
mind on drugs, Favelloni managed
to get clean away,

79
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,800
triggering as he went
the exterior security system,
which was primed at the time.

80
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Favelloni
was Faso's business partner,

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,880
but subsequent investigations have
revealed that they had argued about
money just prior to the murder.

82
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,000
His wife then testified to
the police that he had, in fact...

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
THEY WHISPER
..talked of killing Faso.

84
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,480
After a lengthy interrogation,
he finally confessed, and is
now awaiting trial next month.

85
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,440
Any questions?

86
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,560
So, in fact,
all the evidence is circumstantial.

87
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
There is no actual proof that
Favelloni is the killer? Well, yes.

88
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,520
But Faso had a state-of-the-art
video security system.

89
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,200
Nobody left the property
before Favelloni exited
directly after the murders.

90
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,120
In fact, there are
no other possible suspects.

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,640
But I remember reading
about some Russian?

92
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,960
HE SIGHS

93
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,120
Ukrainian estate worker Avel Vasko.

94
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,400
But at the time of the killings,
he was in a bar
with the local policeman.

95
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,120
We call that an alibi!

96
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,560
Yet we understand there were
some...anomalies in the case?

97
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,840
"Anomalies"? Yes, inconsistencies,
exceptional circumstances.

98
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,520
Yes.
The killings were carried out with
one of Faso's own hunting rifles,

99
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,760
which, despite repeated searches
of the house and grounds,
has not been found.

100
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,200
Secondly, a set of fingerprints
had been identified on the key
to the gun cupboard.

101
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,520
These fingerprints have not been
identified or accounted for. 

102
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,720
So, in your professional opinion,
Detective,

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,600
has this investigation
been thoroughly and competently
carried out?

104
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,000
"Thoroughly and competently,
er, carried out"?

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
HE SIGHS

106
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,520
Um...

107
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,240
Obviously it wasn't...
it wasn't my case.

108
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,560
I wasn't on the original case, but,
er, viewing it from a distance,

109
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,400
from a considerable distance, I...

110
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,600
I think it's important, sir,
to remember that Mr Favelloni
has confessed to these murders.

111
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
Thank you, Detective.

112
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,920
I see your reputation for scrupulous
integrity is well-deserved.

113
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
Thank you.

114
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,040
What did he mean? "My reputation
for scrupulous integrity"?

115
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,920
I know. A vicious smear(!)

116
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,160
They'd obviously done their homework
on you, though. Question is, why?

117
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Dear God, I need a cigarette.

118
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,520
You've given up.

119
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
I'll have one for you.

120
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,440
Can I scrounge one of those off you?
I left mine inside.

121
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,080
Sure. Thanks.

122
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,480
Lovely, thank you. Um...

123
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,360
Did you hear
I'm sleeping with Vincenzo Fabri?

124
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,280
Uh...yeah, I-I-I did hear
something about that.

125
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,520
Well, I'm not. No?

126
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,960
Of course not! He's horrible.

127
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,640
Yes. Yes, he is horrible.

128
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,320
GRINDS CIGARETTE WITH FOOT
Detective,
I want to ask you a favour.

129
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,960
Yeah, of course.

130
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,520
But you don't know what it is yet.
It doesn't matter.

131
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,920
I want you to call my flat tonight.

132
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
My husband will answer the phone.

133
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,280
When he does, I want you to tell him

134
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,600
I have to come back to work
for some reason.

135
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,760
Will you do that for me?

136
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,560
Yeah.

137
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,400
It has to be someone from work,
and I,

138
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know who else I could trust.
No, it's fine.

139
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,760
I have a difficult situation at home.
I understand.

140
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,880
Thank you, Detective. Aurelio.

141
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
My name's Aurelio.

142
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,560
I know.

143
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,920
TV: 'Early this morning, a High Court
judge was brutally murdered
on his way to Milan Central Court.

144
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,280
'Judge Corrado Bertolini
was shot six times.

145
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,240
'Police have stated there is no
apparent motive for the killing.

146
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,600
'In Rome today, a big demonstration
against the cuts...'

147
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,040
What was that about?
Some judge up north - Bertolini?
Something like that.

148
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,440
Six blasts at short range.

149
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,160
They had to identify him
by his watch. Never heard of him.

150
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,680
He was a nobody, on the verge
of retirement. No public profile.
They can't figure out a motive.

151
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,440
Well, it's not our problem.

152
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
What did the minister want?

153
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,440
Where did you hear about that?
In the toilet.

154
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,880
Well, if you hear anything else,
do let me know.

155
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,360
Sorry.

156
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
This is insane.
We can't possibly trust this man Zen.

157
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,760
Of course not.
But in so many ways he's perfect.

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,280
And naturally, if it all goes
wrong, he's quite disposable.
It's time to be strong and decisive.

159
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,320
This whole thing is risky,
despicable, wrong.

160
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,440
I want nothing to do with it.

161
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
I understand completely.

162
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,600
Hi. How are you today?

163
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,720
ANSWERPHONE: Neither Luca nor Tania
can take your call right now.

164
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,840
Please leave a message
after the tone.
BLEEP!

165
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,120
My name's Zen, er,
rank of detective, phoning
from the police headquarters.

166
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,360
This is a message for Tania Moretti.

167
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,160
All support staff are requested
to return to the office

168
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,840
as soon as possible to work on
the Bertolini murder.

169
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,480
It is 8:25pm
and my extension is 9532.

170
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,760
Thank you very much for your time.
Goodbye.

171
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,560
Tania.

172
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,400
Detective! What are you doing here?

173
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,040
Sorry. When you didn't answer
the phone, I, er, I...

174
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
I got worried -
as a colleague, obviously.

175
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,520
That's very sweet.

176
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,960
But there was no need. Good.

177
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,080
OK. Um...seeing as I'm here, you
don't need a lift or anything?

178
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,040
It's OK, really. OK.

179
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm just going into town if you...
if you were going that way?

180
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,600
Seat belt.

181
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,680
I should thank you.

182
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,520
I heard your message.

183
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,840
It was a really clever lie.

184
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,960
Thank you. I think.

185
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I was quite surprised.

186
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,840
Because I...

187
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,560
I was told
you weren't like the rest of them.

188
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,000
You know, corrupt and...

189
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,320
Well, you must know what
people think of the police.

190
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,360
I know I...I owe you an explanation.

191
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,680
But it's a long story and I...

192
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,840
I don't really know where to start.

193
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,480
It's not necessary.

194
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,520
Really? Yeah.

195
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,200
I mean, you know...

196
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,360
..unless you want to tell me.

197
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,160
Do you mind if I don't?
Not just now, anyway.

198
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,680
No. No, all right.

199
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,560
Really, I don't mind.

200
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,840
SHE LAUGHS

201
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,560
That's not such a good lie.

202
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,600
No? No.

203
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,360
It was worth a try.

204
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
Thank you again, Detective -

205
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
Aurelio. See you tomorrow.

206
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
WOMAN LAUGHS

207
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,720
Idiot.

208
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
PHONE RINGS

209
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,280
Zen.

210
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,640
The fact that we're meeting is
known only to the two of us.

211
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,560
What I'm about to tell you
is absolutely confidential.

212
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,760
If you betray me, I shall, without
hesitation, terminate your career.

213
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,680
Very good.

214
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Is this about Oscar Faso?

215
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,400
No, he's dead.

216
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,000
We're talking about
Renato Favelloni,

217
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,040
who, as you know,
is very much alive,

218
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,760
and sitting in a maximum security
prison not very far from here.

219
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,280
What you may not know
is that Favelloni has found God,

220
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,360
and he intends to
defend himself, in court,

221
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,800
with the shield of faith
and the sword of truth.

222
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,240
But he confessed. He is about
to retract his confession.

223
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,360
He now claims he was
having a breakdown.

224
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,000
This will go to trial and he will
have his say. It's a brilliant ploy.

225
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,320
Whatever he says will
doubtless be seized upon
and used to discredit the state.

226
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,440
Now...since Favelloni handled
all the contracts

227
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,000
for Faso's
government construction projects,

228
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,400
there's no end of mud
which might get thrown,
however unfairly, in all directions.

229
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,840
It might even lead to an election.

230
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,680
That is why you...

231
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,280
have to break the case against
him before he gets to court.

232
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
You're not serious?

233
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,520
From your report, it's clear there
are some holes in the case.

234
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,120
All you have to do is
choose one of them, make it bigger.

235
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,520
Given your hard-earned and
unfortunate reputation for honesty,

236
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,880
no-one
will ever suspect your motives.

237
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,320
Obviously, the minister
couldn't afford to get involved
in any of the details.

238
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,160
You'll get your assignment through
the usual channels. I won't do it.

239
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,960
He killed three people.

240
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,240
Quite possibly.

241
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,160
But get him off, Detective.

242
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,800
How you do it is up to you.

243
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
COCKEREL CROWS

244
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,960
They're looking good, Fausto.

245
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,880
Pity you won't be
picking them this year.

246
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,320
How did you find me?
Just out of interest.

247
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,520
Your cousin.

248
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,000
Hard to trust anybody these days.

249
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,280
But then, you'd know all about that.

250
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,000
Look, they wanted you gone.

251
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,200
The chance came to put you away.
It was that or a bullet in the back
one night. I'd have taken my chances.

252
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,040
We can't always choose our own fate,
Tito. But it was nothing personal.

253
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,800
I got the judge yesterday -
did you hear?

254
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,600
No. Was he paid off?

255
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
Well, if he wasn't, he was stupid.
He's a judge. What d'you want?

256
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,800
I've been planning this
for a long time.

257
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,360
Bertolini, you...Zen.

258
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,680
Who's Zen?

259
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,360
A cop on the case.

260
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't remember him. Funny name.

261
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,160
It's Venetian.

262
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,480
Let's get on with it.

263
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,000
GUNSHOT

264
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,560
HE RETCHES

265
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,600
Morning, Mamma.

266
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,000
Your father used to be sick when he
was really worried about something.

267
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,720
I wasn't being sick.

268
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,800
Don't smoke on an empty stomach,
Aurelio, please.

269
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,640
I've just had a coffee.

270
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,000
You promised you'd give up
when you were 30.

271
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,440
And now you're nearly 40.

272
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,240
And your father,
with all his heart problems...

273
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,640
He was shot.

274
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,560
Did you leave out your washing?

275
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
I bet you forgot again.

276
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,200
No wonder she left you.

277
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,240
Detective, the boss wants to see you.

278
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,000
OK. Thanks.

279
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,600
Uh, listen, I... I wondered if I
could buy you lunch, or something.

280
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,520
Erm, I-I-I'm not having lunch
today. I'm a bit behind. But thanks.

281
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,560
What about a drink after work?

282
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,400
I could say I have to stay late.

283
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,360
I'm really busy. Thank you.

284
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,280
Of course. Another time?

285
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,800
Sure.

286
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,200
Close the door.

287
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,840
Late last night, Renato Favelloni
retracted his confession.

288
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,920
As a result, you've been
re-assigned to the Faso case.

289
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,160
Ensure a swift conviction
for Favelloni,

290
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,920
find the holes
and close them up tight.

291
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,920
Do you know anything about this?
No, nothing at all.

292
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,880
I'll have to re-interview Favelloni
and the witnesses.

293
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,560
It'll probably mean getting out
of town for a couple of days,
talking to the local police.

294
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,040
Listen, once you start digging,
God knows what you'll turn up.

295
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,120
Maybe the holes can't be closed up,
maybe the holes shouldn't be closed
up. But I don't care if you find

296
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,640
Oscar Faso alive and well in a bar
in Venice! You hand this case back
exactly the way you found it!

297
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,520
You haven't always been very good
at the politics, Aurelio.

298
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
If it was all about talent and
brains, it'd be you sitting here now

299
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,640
with angina and a headache.
But you know...

300
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,680
A compromise isn't
always dishonesty,
flexibility isn't always corruption.

301
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,760
Something high-profile like this
is a chance for you to get back

302
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,920
to the level where you belong.
Don't blow it.

303
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,560
Because if you tear this case down
and Favelloni walks,

304
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,200
it makes everyone look
very bad indeed.

305
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,600
And this time,
you will not be forgiven.

306
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,760
I say this as your friend.

307
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,240
So go to work,

308
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,200
and for once in your life,
do nothing.

309
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,160
Go to work! Mm-hm.

310
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,840
Hello, Aurelio. How are things?

311
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,680
Fine, thanks, Vincenzo.

312
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,040
I heard a rumour you're
back on the Faso case. Yeah?

313
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,040
I heard a rumour you're
not sleeping with Tania Moretti.

314
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,040
You ever ask yourself how
you ended up like this? Like what?

315
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,400
Sitting on a bomb with "Faso Case"
written on it, heading for
career oblivion in Sicily.

316
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,800
You ever ask yourself why that
doesn't happen to Vincenzo Fabri?

317
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,760
It's all a game, Zen,
you just don't know how to play it.

318
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,000
No, you're right.

319
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,720
I need to get a rich uncle
and start cheating on my wife.

320
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,240
(Boom!)

321
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
And Tania...

322
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,200
..that's just a matter of time.

323
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,680
ELECTRONIC BUZZER

324
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,120
Mr Favelloni, I'm Detective Zen.
I've been asked to review your case.

325
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,000
You sure you don't want your lawyer
here while we talk?

326
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,360
No, no. I've got nothing to hide.

327
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,360
So, did you kill Oscar Faso?

328
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,360
Uh, I'm fairly sure I didn't, no.

329
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,880
"Fairly sure"? Look,
I remember turning up with the girls.

330
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,240
The next thing I remember,

331
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:10,000
I woke up in my car in a forest,
covered in vomit and blood.

332
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,040
Obviously, I had the feeling
the evening hadn't gone well.

333
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,880
Your wife made a statement
saying that you'd talked
about killing Faso.

334
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,760
She was just trying to
get a better deal on the divorce.

335
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,720
Believe me, Detective,
I've nothing to hide.

336
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,520
I've opened my heart to God...

337
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,560
..and I'll open it to you.

338
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,720
I took the money, I took the drugs,
I took the women.

339
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,040
I booked the hookers,
I paid the bribes.

340
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,960
There was no wickedness, none,

341
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,600
that I wasn't party to.

342
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,480
So, if I'd killed Oscar...
I would tell you.

343
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,120
Would you?

344
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,520
Yeah, yeah, of course.

345
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,440
I can see your point.

346
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,920
I can hardly expect
you to believe me.

347
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,880
No-one else does.

348
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,480
Not even my lawyer.

349
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,960
So why did you confess?

350
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,280
Your best friend's been
slaughtered, your business is bust.

351
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,560
You're sitting in prison coming
off a grand a day coke habit.

352
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,080
You try thinking straight.

353
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,200
And then suddenly there
was a deal on the table, you know,
if I confessed, and...

354
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,360
So I took it.

355
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,800
And then I felt I couldn't trust
the people making it.

356
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,080
If you didn't kill him, who did?

357
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,880
Well, if you want my theory...

358
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,760
Our business was in big
trouble last year,

359
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,880
we were going for this huge contract
which was kind of make or break.

360
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,560
And Oscar threatened...

361
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,080
a lot of people,

362
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,920
people with everything to lose,

363
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,760
if he started making a scene.

364
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,880
So, personally, I think the people
who shut him up...

365
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,880
are the same people
getting you to review my case.

366
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,080
I want you to find out
who killed my friend.

367
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,440
Will you do that?

368
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,360
Or will you just write your report
and go home?

369
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,760
If you want to know what
I'd do, I'd play for time and
pray Favelloni has an accident.

370
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,280
You think he might?
Then again, this is Italy
and there's a chance

371
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,800
that the government'll collapse
in the next couple of weeks
and you'll be off the hook.

372
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,400
You really want to know
what I'd do?

373
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,920
I'd jack it all in and come
work for me in the best private
detective agency in Rome.

374
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,200
I don't miss the
Department and neither will you.

375
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,680
Yeah, thanks but no, thanks.

376
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,560
Why not? Because I think
Favelloni's innocent.

377
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,840
Since when? Since I spoke to him.

378
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,040
Look, he's so obviously guilty.

379
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,080
But I think what
they did, is they...

380
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,160
they fixed on that,
from the beginning.

381
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,600
Everything didn't quite fit
and they just ignored it.

382
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,320
Now no-one wants to know.

383
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,000
I know it sounds
stupid, but I believe him.

384
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,880
It's an instinct.

385
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,160
So you're betting your whole career
on instinct?

386
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,760
You better be right.

387
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,880
Yeah, I know.
Your instinct's been wrong before.

388
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,760
Hasn't it?

You're being followed. What?

391
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Yeah, I think so. I noticed him
hanging around across the street
when we were talking.

392
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,400
When you left, he went after you so
I followed him, but I lost him.

Are you sure?
Who'd want to follow me?

How about the Ministry?

395
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,280
No, if he was Secret Service,
you wouldn't have seen him.

396
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,880
I might be wrong.
Just watch your back.

397
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,080
OK.

What?

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,520
Outside the bar where you dropped me.
Well, it's none of my business.

403
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,960
He's an old friend of mine,

404
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,640
a lawyer,

405
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,760
and I was asking
his advice about getting a divorce.

406
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,920
He's also gay, but
that's beside the point.

407
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,120
I'm sorry
if you thought I was just using you.

408

I was very grateful for what you did.

out of the apartment right now,

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,040

I said it was urgent.

I'm very busy and I assumed
it was urgent for you, not for me.

Fausto Arcuti?

Is he one of the Arcuti Arcutis?
He was shot dead this morning
up at some farm in Umbria.

418
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:35,320
So?
So he was in hiding, new identity,
the lot, but they still got him.

419
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,520
The point is he was a
friend of mine, I know the family.

420
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,480
They want to know what happened.

421
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,240
They want to know
what the police know. All right.
I'll make some calls.

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,920
Thanks.
If you ever need anything in return?

I thought I was going to be,

I really wanted to ask
you something.

OK.

Hi.

Hi.

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,680
So... What did you want to ask me?

00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,240
Um... I'm going away tomorrow,
just for a while

440
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,240
and there's something that I
need you to deal with for me.

441
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,600
It's not really official
business so I don't want
anyone else to know about it. OK.

442
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,080
So someone's going to be calling
with some information about

443
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,760
the murder of someone
called Fausto Arcuti.

so I've given them your number.
Hope you don't mind. No.

445
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,840
Also could you look into our
files see if we have
anything on him?

446
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,080
Is that all?

447
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,880
Yeah.

00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,040
Is it true you're
separated from your wife?

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,440
Yeah. Is that what you heard?

That's what they say, yes.
What else do they say?

They say...you are...

454
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
too honest for your own good.

455
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,440
And you live alone with your mother.

456
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,960
It all sounds so glamorous.

457
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,240
And they also say
you're not seeing anyone.

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,320
Well, I work all the time, you know.

00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,040
Romizi told me that.

462
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,680
I suppose
most of them begin like this,

463
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,400
an innocent drink after work.

464
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,200
It doesn't really mean anything,
but just before you know it...

465
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,600
You know, um...

466
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,840
I never really saw myself as
the "other guy"...

467
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,240
..breaking up a marriage.

468
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,480
My marriage is already broken up.

469
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,520
I just want to be happy again.

470
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,000
I know what you mean.

471
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,760
Um...

472
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,840
I'm going this way. I'll see
you, then, when you get back. Yeah.

473
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,880
Are we going to have an affair?
Yeah. OK.

PHONE RINGS

475
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,840
Are you having me followed?

476
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,120
Is someone following you?
You mean to tell me you don't know?

477
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,640
No. That's...

478
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,400
very disturbing.

479
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,080
Don't call this number again.

482
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,320
Mamma?

483
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,800
Mamma?

484
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,160
Sorry, I lost him.
He jumped in a cab.

485
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,840
It's OK.

486
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,600
He came home 20 minutes ago.

No-one here, Papa.

489
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,920
I'm so sorry, Rosella,
to impose on you like this.

490
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,960
We're thrilled to have you.

491
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,880
Come on in.

492
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,080
Look, I've been thinking.

493
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:09,960
If Favelloni didn't kill Oscar Faso,
then the people who did
are still out there.

494
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,000
And they're the ones
who are following you.

495
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,160
There's a fire escape out the back.

496
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,320
Does this...

497
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,440
mean he knows?

498
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,080
Hi.

499
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,440
Zen. I think you're expecting me.

500
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,240
What sort of a name's Zen?

501
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,960
Venetian.
You ever been here before?

502
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,800
No. The boys in these mountains,
they've been kidnapping
strangers for centuries.

503
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,080
They don't give a damn about you
or the law.

504
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,760
So if you intend to go wandering
around, you need to remember that.

505
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,800
You want to visit the Faso place?
Yeah.

506
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,000
So how come no-one
tried snatching Faso?

507
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,400
They did. They hit him last
year on the road, just up here.

508
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,160
He only managed to escape by
driving over one of the kidnappers.
Left him smeared on the road.

509
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,880
But they took the body away,
back to the mountains,
so no arrests got made.

510
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,560
That wasn't in the file.
Why should it be?

511
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,080
Right.

512
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,520
That's the caretaker and his wife.
She's Russian.

513
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,920
Mr Bini,
I'm Detective Zen from Rome.

514
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,160
This is my wife, Ana.

515
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,720
I'm grateful for your time.

516
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,840
The bastard stood there
and the camera was there.

517
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,080
Sprayed the room.

518
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,760
Where are the guns kept?

519
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,360
The key's always kept here.

520
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,600
Which, of course, Favelloni knew.

521
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,720
Yes... but, um...

522
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,560
the fingerprints on it
weren't his, were they?

523
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,280
You must have some idea
whose they might have been?

524
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,200
What do you mean?

525
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,640
Well, just, if someone comes to fix
the alarm or clean the carpets,
you give them the key, right?

526
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,120
What are you saying? I'd also really
love to find this missing gun.

527
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,480
I've looked everywhere,
even after the police left.

528
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,040
Well, we know that Favelloni had
about a minute between

529
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,000
shooting everyone here
and stumbling out that door
without the gun.

530
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So it's less than a
minute from here. Somewhere.
Unless it was removed later.

531
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,280
Ana and I came straight here.

532
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,360
And then the police arrived.

533
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,960
Mm.

534
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,760
So you don't think it's
possible that someone could have
come here earlier and hidden away?

535
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,360
Nobody came until
Mr Faso came down with his friends.

536
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,120
Are you sure?
Listen, the whole place is alarmed.

537
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,360
Every door, every window.

538
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,400
The walls are a metre thick.

539
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,600
The perimeter fence is electrified.

540
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:15,760
Nobody can get in here without
me knowing! Favelloni killed them.

541
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,560
There was nobody else!

542
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,520
Do you mind turning
all the security off?

543
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,880
I'd really like
to have a look around.

544
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,960
Thank you.

545
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,240
Hello.

546
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,520
It's all right.
It's just a lighter.

547
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,280
My name's Aurelio.

548
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,440
Is it this you like?

549
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,600
Do you want to have a look?

550
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,800
It's all right.

551
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:42,120
I'd kind of like to talk to the
estate worker, Avel Vasko?

552
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,880
Too bad. As soon as the
investigation died down, he ran away.

553
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,240
What? Was this reported and...?

554
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,040
What for? He was Russian scum.

555
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,160
No papers like the rest of them.

556
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,840
No morals either.

557
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,480
Work for nothing, pay no taxes.

558
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,240
They're ruining this country.

559
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,640
I'd kind of like to
talk to Bini's wife alone.

560
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,000
That won't be easy.
He watches her like a hawk.

561
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,960
For obvious reasons.
Not that it makes any difference.

562
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,520
I'll see what I can do.

563
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,800
Also, I saw a girl
behind the fence there.

564
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,360
That would be Lucia.

565
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,520
What's wrong with her?
What's wrong?

566
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,160
Her old man kept her locked up
in a cellar her whole life and then
raped her every Sunday after Mass.

567
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,680
What? Nobody knew. It only came out
after he died two or three years ago.

568
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,560
How is that possible?

569
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,680
People mind their own business
up here.

570
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,360
She was too far gone to fit back in

571
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,160
and now she lives up in
the forest like a wild animal.

572
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,840
And the house got auctioned
to pay off debts and that's
how Oscar Faso got it.

573
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,560
She used to live here?

574
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,080
All her life.

575
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,080
Mario, has she been interviewed?

576
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,200
She barely speaks.

577
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,240
I'd like to talk to her, please.

578
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,200
Don't you have any, like,
proper leads or something?

579
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,600
Nobody knows exactly where she lives.

580
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,440
The whole mountain's riddled
with underground streams and tunnels.

581
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,520
It goes on for miles.

582
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,640
The Partisans used to
hide there in the war.

583
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,080
But nobody uses them now,
it's too dangerous.

584
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,880
OK.

585
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,400
Here we are.

586
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,600
That's one of the caves.

587
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,320
But there are others.

588
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,160
How do we find her?
We wander around and keep quiet.

589
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,200
Hi.

590
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,000
Lucia.

591
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,360
It's me, Aurelio.

592
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,880
Remember?

593
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,400
Lucia, don't run.

594
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,040
Lucia!

595
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,440
Please don't...

596
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,360
It's not that deep,
can I have the torch?

597
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,520
You shouldn't go in there.

598
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,960
Told you! Are you OK?

599
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,920
I'm fine.
Well, don't go any further.

600
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,720
I'll get a rope.
Don't worry, I won't.

601
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,680
Lucia?

602
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,160
Lucia?

603
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,160
Mario!

604
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,440
Mario!

605
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,040
Help, please!

606
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,560
Please help.

607
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,400
I'm sorry I touched your things.

608
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,960
FOOTSTEPS

609
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,240
How did you get in here?

610
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,800
I'll give you a lift to the village.

611
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,960
Yeah, thanks.

612
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,480
She was down there for years.

613
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,560
She must have literally dug
her way into the cave system

614
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,480
and then just come
and gone from there.

615
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,840
Do you recognise that?

616
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,120
It's Faso's. That was a big
fuss when it went missing.

617
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,360
But stuff went missing quite a lot.

618
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,760
Little things. And the alarms
going off in the night for no reason.

619
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,240
We were always calling
the alarm company.

620
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,520
We thought the house was haunted.

621
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:24,800
It's funny. All that money spent on
security and some crazy girl just
comes and goes whenever she wants.

622
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,840
It wasn't only her...

623
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,640
Whoever killed Faso came and
went the same way, I'm sure of it.

624
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,560
My husband is out.

625
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:37,920
Do you wanna go upstairs? I'm sorry?

626
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,880
I actually just wanted to
ask you about Avel Vasko...

627
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,560
What's the matter?

628
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,720
You don't like sex? No, I
remember it very fondly, I just,

629
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,560
I really wanted to talk to
you because I need your help...

630
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:57,480
Because if you're worried
my husband will come back,
he's gone to the town. Has he?

631
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,800
Well, um...

632
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,040
what I really wanted
to know was, um,

633
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,600
whether your affair with Avel had
anything to do with the murders?

634
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,240
Who says we had an affair?

635
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,080
He's a good-looking man.

636
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,840
So what if we did?

637
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,080
It's just that it might occur
to some people that even though

638
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,040
he didn't have access
to the alarm system, you did.

639
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,000
I'd definitely have to report
that link and you know what our
bureaucracy's like,

640
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,760
once your name gets stuck
in the system, immigration's
going to take an interest,

641
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,720
tax authorities will want
to have a look...
All right, all right.

642
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,520
I liked him.

643
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,160
I thought he liked me too,
but I was wrong. Where is he?

644
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,880
His mobile is dead,
the number he had here.

645
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,760
Have you got an address for him,
in the Ukraine?

646
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,640
He wasn't from the Ukraine.

647
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,120
He was Italian.

648
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:59,560
What? He spoke good Russian,
his grandmother was from Kiev.

649
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,800
But he was from up there,
in the mountains.

650
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,000
What's his real name?
Well, he said it was Giulio,
but he said a lot of things.

651
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,920
Why didn't you tell the police?

652
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,800
Because I loved him.

653
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,000
I would have never betrayed him.

654
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,880
And my husband
would've kicked me out.

655
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,640
Anyway, I never liked
Faso that much.

656
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,440
He was always trying to get me into
bed, you know,

657
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,720
which to me is very impolite
when you are someone's boss.

658
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,400
And I was married.

659
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,760
Hi, Mario. Oh, never mind.

660
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,080
No, forget it.

661
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,400
What's happened to you?

662
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,360
In my file, you'll
find a picture of Avel Vasko.
Dig it out, will you?

663
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,400
He's not Ukrainian, he's an Italian
national and he's hiding out

664
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,080
somewhere in the mountains
and we're going to find him.

665
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,640
He was in the bar
with me watching football
the night Faso was killed.

666
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,680
He would be, wouldn't he?
It's a perfect alibi, in fact,
he's the inside man.

667
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,760
Now when you find it,
get it out all over the region.

668
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,000
He's here. Extraordinary.

669
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,640
We couldn't have planned it better,
somewhere remote like this.
OK, so we grab him later.

670
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,840
Take him somewhere even more remote.

671
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,480
PHONE RINGS

672
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,800
Murder squad. Hi.

673
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,600
Hi! How are you? I'm pretty good...

674
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,000
It's incredible, the case just
fell open right in front of me.

675
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,840
We know who was behind it,
we know how they got in the house.

676
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:38,040
Now all we have to do is find them.
You mean Favelloni didn't do it? No.

677
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,480
A lot of people will look
stupid when it comes out.

678
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,480
But, it's the right thing
to do, isn't it?

679
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,080
Yeah, it's the right thing to do.

680
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:56,760
Listen, I got the file on Arcuti,
but I haven't had time to read it,
I'm going to sneak it home tonight.

681
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,280
Don't worry about him.
Arcuti's dead, it can wait a bit.

682
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,640
Well, your friend rang again today,
asking where you were.

683
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,520
Like I work for him!

684
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:10,320
I told him you were up in the
mountains on this case, but you'd be
back in a few days. Thanks. Listen...

685
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,600
I really wish you were here.

686
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,840
I wish I was too.

687
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,800
All right, OK, OK.

688
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,760
Avel. Giulio?

689
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,560
Thank you for coming to see me.

690
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,320
Please, sit down.

691
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,160
Help yourself.

692
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,160
You won't be eating
anywhere else tonight. No thank you,
I'm not very hungry.

693
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:24,120
Well, don't let my sister hear
you say that, she's gone to
a lot of trouble for you.

694
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,840
It's our own.

695
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,960
It's not bad, I'd have
thought you were a
bit high up for vines, aren't you?

696
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,600
You think I killed Oscar Faso.

697
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,160
I have been wondering, yeah.

698
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,000
And I don't want police all
over my mountain, so I'll
tell you what happened.

699
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,600
Couldn't you have just
called during office hours?

700
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,400
I hate to see the old
traditions die away.

701
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:57,120
So, this is how it was,
we tried to steal Oscar Faso
last year for a ransom.

702
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:04,040
But it didn't work out.
He panicked and drove off,
straight over my brother.

703
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,960
Obviously he had to pay for that,

704
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,680
but he tightened up security, so we
needed someone on the inside

705
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,600
and a local like me
wouldn't have stood a chance,
so I got a job as a Russian.

706
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,920
I speak the language well
enough to fool an Italian.

707
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,040
Yeah, I heard. Your
grandmother was from Kiev, right?

708
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,920
How is Ana?

709
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,320
Didn't seem very happy to me.

710
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,840
Oh...

711
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,760
Well...

712
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,360
Anyway, so there I am with Mario

713
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:46,440
in the village watching
the game and when I came back,
everybody was dead.

714
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,560
Are you telling me you
didn't have Oscar Faso killed?

715
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,040
We wanted to ransom him first.

716
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,560
Look, detective, if I just wanted
to kill him, I would have take

717
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,080
a hunting rifle with a night sight
and sat in a tree outside the fence.

718
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,040
Why break in through
that alarm system?

719
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,480
And why kill all those strangers?

720
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,720
You know the rules of vendetta
are very clear, an eye for an eye.

721
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,680
It must have been someone
local, because it was
done through the caves.

722
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,560
There's a way in through the caves?
Yeah.

723
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,400
I didn't think there was anybody
still alive who knew those tunnels.

724
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,920
Can I go back to the village now,
or are you going to ransom me?

725
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,600
Are you worth anything?
I don't think so, no.

726
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,120
No. I don't think so either.

727
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,400
I'm going back down in the
morning, I'll give you a ride.

728
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,400
Hey, do you want to hear
how my grandfather made it back

729
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,120
from the Eastern front with my
grandmother in tow? Incredible story.

730
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,160
Yeah, why not?

731
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,760
PHONE RINGS

732
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,240
Mario.

733
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,440
Mario!

734
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,560
PHONE CONTINUES TO RING

735
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,360
Guardia. Aurelio!

736
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,600
I've been calling you all night.

737
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,920
I was up a mountain. What's up?

738
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,360
It's the file you
gave me about Acuti.

739
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,440
He was a witness at a
murder trial years ago.

740
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:55,040
Well, I was reading the file
and I noticed that the judge at
the trial was Corrado Bertolini.

741
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,440
The one that got killed
the other day outside Milan.

742
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:05,240
Yeah, I know who he is.
That's when I began to worry. Why?

743
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:09,520
It says in the file,
the Senior Investigating Officer

744
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,120
was Aurelio Zen.
Sorry, what trial was this?

745
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,800
A man called Tito Spadola
got life for murder.

746
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,320
Yes, I was on that.

747
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:23,800
No but, not very long I mean,
I don't think I ever met Spadola

748
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,880
or the witnesses, or the judge.

749
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,880
Well, I thought you should know.

750
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,240
Aurelio? Listen to me...

751
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,560
You said that Angelo
called yesterday,

752
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,640
you told him where I was.

753
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,000
Are you sure it was Angelo?

754
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,840
What do you mean?

755
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,080
Did he actually say it was Angelo?
No.

756
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,600
He didn't.

757
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,680
Paulo.

758
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,200
Wait outside.

759
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,600
'Sit down.'

760
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,520
Aurelio.

761
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,240
Didn't you get life?

762
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,760
Oh, yes.

763
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,280
For a murder I never did.

764
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,520
But when they found
the cancer was terminal,

765
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,320
I got compassionate release.

766
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,320
I've got a couple of
months left, they reckon. Still...

767
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,840
That's a couple of months
more than you.

768
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,320
What did I ever do to you?

769
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,640
Bit late for those games, sorry.

770
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,720
Humour me.

771
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,120
You fixed the evidence.

772
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:52,160
That gun was planted
in my flat, by the police.
More than likely, but not by me.

773
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,440
Well, you would say
that, wouldn't you?

774
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,360
But I remember very clearly,

775
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,360
you were in charge.

776
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,760
You have a very memorable name.

777
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,320
It was just for a month,
I was covering,
then I was transferred out.

778
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,960
It was nothing to do with me.
It never is, is it?

779
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,200
Come on, you're a cop,
that's what you do, you take
the money, you fix the evidence.

780
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,040
In fact, I imagine that's what
you're doing here, isn't it?

781
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,320
Fixing the evidence.
Yeah it is, as a matter of fact.

782
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,880
I'm sorry I don't really
get what you're moaning about.

783
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,160
Presumably, you killed loads of
people you didn't get done for. So?

784
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,640
It doesn't work like that.

785
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:36,520
It was a game,
and I was very good at it.

786
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,840
Much better than you. You couldn't
get me. So you, cheated.

787
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,200
Yeah.

788
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,680
But that's just part of
the game though, isn't it?

789
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:51,600
A game that you're apparently
so good at.

790
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,240
Get up!

791
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,120
Go.

792
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,840
Did you put enough sugar
in the tank? Plenty.

793
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,000
There!

794
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,840
Take it easy. There's no rush.

795
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,240
On your knees!

796
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,560
On your knees.

797
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,920
Any last words?

798
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,720
Pity, you'd plenty to say before.

799
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,800
GUNSHOT

800
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,440
Papa!

801
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:43,360
Lucia! No! Please, please...

802
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,760
Everything OK?

803
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,320
I never killed anyone before.

804
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,280
Detective,
what a thrilling denouement.

805
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,080
A car chase, a shoot out.

806
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,640
Seven murders solved and an innocent
man set free. Quite incredible.
Thank you.

807
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,200
We'll be seeing you again, I'm sure.

808
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,640
Have they found the girl yet?

809
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,480
The search has been
called off, I'm afraid.

810
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:48,880
Unofficially, of course.
The cave system is impenetrable

811
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,320
and frankly, we've run out of money.
Will that jeopardise our case?

812
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,640
No, the gun is the one we've been
looking for from the Faso killings

813
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:00,960
and the prints on it match the
ones all over the villa and
from the key to the gun cupboard.

814
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,240
With that much physical evidence,
no-one will contest her guilt.

815
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,200
Finding her will complicate things.
How did you arrange it all?

816
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:12,200
Obviously, the minister
need not become involved
in any of the details.

817
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:17,680
Nevertheless, I'm curious as to the
motive you ascribed to the girl.

818
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:21,560
Well, to be honest I
couldn't come up with any.

819
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,280
But I figured,

820
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,440
homeless peasant,

821
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:29,640
no political connections,
she seemed an ideal candidate.

822
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,360
We are greatly in
your debt, detective.

823
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:37,640
And we shall not forget it. Mmm.

824
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:41,440
Well, seeing as you
bring it up, erm...

825
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:51,000
This case, it's upset
a lot of people in my department,
particularly my boss.

826
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:58,920
I was thinking that it might be
good for morale if he could know

827
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:04,960
that none of the budget cuts this
year will affect his department,

828
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,960
at all.

829
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,400
Of course, law and order
is our number one priority.

830
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,000
As I noticed.

831
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,360
And, um...

832
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,600
my colleague...

833
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,000
..Vincenzo Fabri?

834
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,360
Yes, I know his uncle.

835
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,920
He's often expressed a desire to
broaden his experience elsewhere.

836
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,360
You feel a sudden move
might benefit his career?

837
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,040
He once mentioned Sicily.

838
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,880
My dear detective, I had
no idea you had it in you.

839
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,200
Hey, detective.

840
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,440
What are you doing here? I'm so
glad we bumped into each other.

841
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,080
I wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

842
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,040
Forget it. No, I won't.

843
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,000
The girl...

844
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,520
Why did she kill Oscar
and the others?
What had they ever done to her?

845
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,760
We don't know, we never will.

846
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:16,320
But, I want to ask you a question.

847
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,200
Finding God and all that, was that,

848
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,320
was that for real
or was it just a move?

849
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,800
Take care, detective.

850
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,160
Miss Moretti.

851
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,120
Good morning, detective.

852
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,840
The chief wants to see you.

853
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,240
He's very cross. I'm ready for him.

854
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,840
But you did the right thing.

855
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,000
Didn't you? How do you mean?

856
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,680
There is a rumour you
fixed the whole case.

857
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,600
The evidence, everything.

858
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,120
It's not true.

859
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,400
I was so worried about you.

860
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,520
Vincenzo.
