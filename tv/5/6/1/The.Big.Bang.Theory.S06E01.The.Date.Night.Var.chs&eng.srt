I have strongly mixed feelings!

Howard真的上太空了
So,Howard's really in space,huh?

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,220
恩 国际空间站
Mm-hmm,International Space Station.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,340
两百五十英里远
250 miles that way.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,620
现在 Howard正像个迷你犹太神 一样看着我们的地球
Right now,Howard's staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

11

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,680
我必须承认 我禁不住有点嫉妒

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,640
他转向窗外 就能看到壮丽的宇宙
He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,460
透过他那暗淡迷茫的眼睛
His dim,uncomprehending eyes.

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,310
像只机场行李箱的小猫一样
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,870
其实上面也没那么好
You know,it's not exactly glamorous up there.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,760
他们的饮用水是 用别人的尿液里过滤而来的
The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other's recycled urine.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,250
听起来不错
Must be nice.

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,170
我尿出来的肯定没人想喝
Nobody wants anything that comes out of  me.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,450
我很想知道他现在在干吗
I wonder what he's doing right this very second.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,090
恩 也许在零重力状态下做实验
Mm,conducting experiments in zero gravity.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,730
通过望远镜探视宇宙的起源
Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,280
不管做什么 他的人生已经大不相同了
Whatever it is,we know his life will never be the same.

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,300
Howard! 你能听见吗?
Howard! Can you hear me?!

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,610
不用电话都能听见!
I can hear you  without  the phone!

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,380
不要凶我
Don't be snippy.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,970
和我宝贝通话 我太激动了!
I'm just excited to talk to my baby!

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,940
和你通话 我也很激动
I'm excited to talk to you,too.

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,580
听说你疯了 要搬出去 和那小波兰女孩一起住
So,what's this  mishegas  about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?!

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,190
她现在是我妻子好不好?
How about calling her my wife?

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,790
妻子是不会从丈夫他妈那儿 抢走儿子的
Wives don't take boys from their mothers.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,940
当然会的
They do.

33
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,410
不然结婚干吗!
That's why we marry them!

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,620
希望你回来之前 我不会心碎而死

Ma,please.

36
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,460
整个NASA的人都听着这通电话呢
Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,580
很好 应该让他们知道 你是个多么不孝的儿子
Good. They should know what a horrible son you are!

38
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,990
好吧 妈 很高兴和你聊 挂了
Okay,Ma,great talking to you!Gotta go!

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,390
好了 太空生活也毁了

43
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,160
太让人兴奋了
This is so exciting.

44
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,120
很快 我的上唇就会 和我漂亮闺蜜的假金发一样美了
Soon,my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,430
嘿 我的头发本来就是这个颜色
Hey,this is my natural hair color.

46
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,980
现在是
Now.

47
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,470
明晚Sheldon有没有什么特殊安排?
So,does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?

48
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,470
有的
Oh,yes.

49
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,940
根据"交往协议" 在我们首次约会的周年纪念日
According to the Relationship Agreement,on the anniversary of our first date,

50
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,670
他必须带我出去吃顿好的 问我过得如何
he must take me to a nice dinner,ask about my day

51
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,090
来点身体接触 让别人误以为我们在亲热
and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,360
好刺激
That's hot.

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,450
你们得做好防护措施
You kids better use protection.

54
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,650
还要多久?
How long does this stay on?

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,750
几分钟就好了
Just a couple of minutes.

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,510
你以前没弄过?
You've really never done this before?

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,770
高中时候弄过一次 但我中途打瞌睡 醒来脸就成二度化学烧伤了
Once in high school,but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.

58
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,700
天哪 太悲剧了
Oh,my gosh,that's awful.

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,180
其他孩子笑话你了吗?
The other kids make fun of you?

60
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,070
没 我骗他们说是疱疹
No,I had a cover story; I told everyone it was herpes.

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,850
你和Leonard最近咋样?
So,how's everything going with you and Leonard?

62
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,950
我也不知道 还是很诡异
I don't know,it's still kind of weird.

63
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,730
还没从他做爱时 向我求婚那事缓过来
We haven't really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,070
真悲剧
Boo-hoo.

65
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,560
如果Sheldon在做爱时向我求婚 我的子宫会紧抓住他 永不放手
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex,my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,600
Leonard 你怎么看"人择原理"
Leonard,where do you stand on the anthropic principle?

67
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,650
很有趣
Interesting question.

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,520
一方面 我认为...
On the one hand,I always thought...

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,560
你都不知道是什么吧?
You don't even know what it is,do you?

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,830
"人择原理"是指如果我们要解释 为什么宇宙是现在这样
The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does,

71
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,310
答案就是正因为有这样的宇宙...
the answer is that it must have qualities

72
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,440
人类这种智慧物种才会存在 才有能力来问这个问题
that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question.

73
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,070
比如我现在这么流利地表达
As I am doing so eloquently right now.

74
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,330
我知道"人择原理"是什么
I know what the anthropic principle is.

75
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,400
当然 我刚给你解释了啊
Of course.I just explained it to you.

76
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,780
你怎么看?
Now,where do you stand on it?

77
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,840
你怎么看?
Where do you stand on it?

78
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,140
非常赞成
Strongly pro.

79
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,830
那么我相信上帝用六天创造了世界 然后第七天创造了你来烦我
Then I believe that God created the world in six days,and on the seventh,he made you to annoy me.

80
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,570
嘿 哥们
Hey,guys.

81
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,300
等等 Raj 你怎么看"人择原理"?
Yeah,wait,Raj,where do you stand on the anthropic principle?

82
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,040
完全赞同
I'm all for it.

83
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,170
好样的
Attaboy!

84
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,370
等等
Well,hang on.

85
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,510
为什么你认为他知道 而我却不知道
Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?

86
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,670
哦 Leonard
Oh,Leonard.

87
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,230
咱别自讨没趣好吗
Let's not take a saw to the branch we're sitting on,shall we?

88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,940
嘿 你们晚上有空的话
Hey,uh,if you guys are free tonight,

89
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:17,360
有个温泉浴场 你把脚浸到水里 会有很多小鱼来吃脚上的死皮
I heard about a spa where you soak your feet in a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them.

90
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,750
不用我提醒吧 洛杉矶的凉鞋季节马上来咯
I don't need to tell you,in Los Angeles,sandal season is year round.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,060
我和Penny有约
Actually,I'm hanging out with Penny.

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,050
好吧
Oh,okay.

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,790
那就只剩下我们俩了 Sheldon
Sounds like it's me and you,Sheldon.

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,230
咱一起去让孔雀鱼吃吃脚吧?
How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?

95
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,940
我已经重复无数遍了
As I've stated before on numerous occasions,

96
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,240
在所有海洋生物里 我只愿意被海妖吃掉
the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken,

97
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,650
因为那样我生前听到的 最后一句话就是"放出海妖"
because the last words I would hear are: "Release the Kraken.

98
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,651
{\a7}(电影"诸神之战"经典台词)
***

99
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,140
每听必嗨
" That never gets old.

100
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,020
"放出海妖" 好爽
"Release the Kraken!" Oh,chills.

101
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,700
再说 我今晚要与Amy共进晚餐
Besides,I'm having dinner with Amy.

102
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,120
好啊
Oh,okay.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,860
那我就回家 一个人待着好了
I'll just go home and be alone.

104
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,950
其实挺不错的
W-Which is cool.

105
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,870
我一个人吃饭 一个人睡觉 一个人哭...
I eat alone,I sleep alone,I cry alone,so...

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,690
真不错
Cool.

107
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,790
见鬼 如果你不忙的话 可以加入我们
Darn. If you weren't busy,I'd ask you to join us.

108
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,890
真的吗? 我也能来? 谢谢!
Really? I can come?Thanks!

109
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,370
Sheldon 你真得要带着Raj 去和Amy约会吗?
Sheldon,are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?

110
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,900
当然了
Oh,absolutely.

111
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,470
我和Amy的协议中有规定 我要向她提供交流和身体接触
I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact,

112
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,750
但并没有说明我不能外包给印度人
but nowhere is it specified that I can't outsource that to an Indian.

113
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,751
{\a7}(印度是外包业大国)

114
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,150
Howie?
Howie?

115
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,680
Howie?
Howie?

116
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,500
嘿 我美貌如花的老婆!
Hey,there's my beautiful bride!

117
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,680
看得见我吗?
Can you see me?

118
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,840
看得见
I can.

119
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,050
你还好吗?
How are you?

120
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,510
棒极了
I'm amazing.

121
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,960
比我梦里的还要好
I mean,this is even better than I dreamed.

122
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,320
我向窗外看去...
I look out the window,and...

123
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,300
太不可思议了
it's all so unbelievable.

124
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,040
真好
Good for you.

125
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,810
我刚刚和你妈吃了顿马拉松晚餐
I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.

126
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,610
是吗? 挺好的呀
Oh,yeah? That's nice.

127
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,690
一开始是的
It was.

128
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,870
直到我发现你没告诉她 我们不会跟她住
Until I found out you never told her we're not gonna live with her.

129
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,260
我们来谈谈这事吧
Let's talk about  that  for a minute.

130
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,210
看啊 这支笔漂起来了
Hey,look,this pen is floating.

131
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,590
多疯狂啊
How crazy is that?

132
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,140
你说已经告诉她了 根本没有!
You said you told her,but you never did!

133
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,730
好吧 我知道你很失望
Okay,okay,I know you're upset,but...

134
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,900
但让我分享一下 我到这边之后学到的
let me share something I've learned since I got here.

135
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:36,040
从太空看下来 你就明白自己的问题有多么微不足道
You realize how small your problems are when you're looking down on them from space.

136
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,120
好受些了吧
Now,come on,that's got to make you feel better.

137
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,080
我在你的屏幕上清楚吗?
How clear is the image of me on that screen?

138
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,480
挺清楚的
Pretty clear.

139
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,160
那我看起来像是好点了吗?
Do I  look  like I feel better?

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,370
视频也不是太高清啦
I mean,it's not,like,HD quality.

141
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,200
听着 先生 你要去告诉你妈 解决这事
Listen,mister,you're gonna talk to your mother and you're gonna fix this,

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,590
否则你回来之后 我说要做的那事 你就自行解决吧
or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home,you can do to yourself.

143
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,260
他到了这儿之后就没少干
Like he's been doing since he got here.

144
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,820
Sheldon 这地方真浪漫
Sheldon,this place is so romantic.

145
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,410

Over here!

151
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,410
我不理解 他在这儿干吗?
I don't understand.What's he doing here?

152
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,280
我请他来的
I invited him.

153
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,790
参加我们的约会?
On our date?

154
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,720
Sheldon 这样不对
Sheldon,that's not okay.

155
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,980
很对
Yes,it is.

156
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,330
交往协议里有一处漏洞
There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.

157
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,400
你找到个漏洞?
You found a loophole?

158
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,260

Sorry I started without you.

159
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,570
我有点紧张
I'm a little nervous.

160

哥很久没约会了
It's been a long time since I've been on a date.

161
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,940
真不敢相信 我还漂白了唇毛
I can't believe I bleached my mustache for this.

162
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,420
你应该去我姐们那儿
You should go to my girl.

163
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,110
她还会帮你免费修鬓角
She'll knock out those sideburns for free.

164
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,630
你知道吗 Amy 我们俩还没有真正交流过
You know,Amy,I don't even think you and I have had a real conversation.

165
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,350
今晚是个进一步认识的好机会
Let's use tonight to get to know each other a little better.

168
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,200
我不明白
I don't understand.

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,190
Sheldon 你怎么能这样做? 今天是我们两周年纪念日
Sheldon,how could you do this?It's our second anniversary.

170
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,360
是你们的纪念日?!
It's your anniversary?!

171
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,190
天啊 我不知道
Oh,my God,I had no idea.

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,470
Amy 请让我来弥补
Amy,please,let me make this right.

173
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,420
谢谢

服务生? 来一瓶香槟 外加三个杯子

176
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,060
这太浪漫了吧?
Oh,boy,isn't this romantic?

177
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,660
我希望这是句反问句 因为我没感觉
Oh,I hope that's a rhetorical question,because I have no clue.

178
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,790
真不错
This is great.

179
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,700
是为了什么事?
What's the occasion?

180
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,850
没什么
No occasion.

181
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,980
就是我们之间最近不是很顺
You know,things have been a little weird between us,

182
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,750
所以我想单独为你 准备一个"快乐之夜"
so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.

183
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,000
你想得真周到

186
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,430
我还在肚皮上画了东西
I even painted my stomach.

187
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,490
"加油 运动"?
"Go sports"?

188
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,360
这个嘛...
Well...

189
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,880
万一你想看棒球 我不想太尴尬
in case you were in the mood for baseball,I didn't want to look ridiculous.

190
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,390
太棒了 我喜欢!
This is awesome.I love it!

191

Gosh,I worked my ass off today.This is exactly what I needed.

193

谢啦!
Ah,thank you!

195
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,950
那么 我们到底是什么关系呢?
So,where exactly are we in this relationship?

196
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,660
不是吧!
Oh,come on!

197
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,380
我刚告诉你今天很累
I just told you I had a hard day.

198
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,310
是的 很抱歉 看球赛吧!
You're right,I'm sorry.Let's watch the game.

199
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,120
很好
Great.

200
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,870
我发现越刻意不提 越奇怪
I just know the longer we wait to talk about it,the weirder it gets.

201
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,040
亲 今晚让我当个妹子好不?
Sweetie,can I just be the girl tonight?

202
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,120
当然 你是妹子 我是汉子
Absolutely.You're the girl,I'm the guy.

203
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,860
好好看球赛吧 我给你弄点吃的
Now,you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.

204
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,260
谢了!
Thank you!

205
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,460

你怎么在这儿?
What are you doing here?

209
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,270
你不是跟Sheldon和Amy一起吗?
I thought you were out th Sheldon and Amy.

210
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,360
没错 但今天是他俩周年纪念 我不想当电灯泡
I was,but it's their anniversary and I didn't want to be a third wheel,

211
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,540
所以我决定参加你和Penny的约会
so I figured I'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.

212
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,510
嗯 只怕时机不对
Well,it's not really a great time.

213
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,410
Penny和我有些事要谈
Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.

214
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,980
没啊 没事! 进来吧!
No,we don't!Come on in!

215
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,860

Sweet!

216
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,160
真不敢相信 我还为今晚剃了肚毛
I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this.

217
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,470
嘿 水果圈
Hey,Froot Loops.

You got a phone call.

219

Who is it?

220
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,890
一个自称你妈的人 但听起来像你爸
A woman who says she's your mother but sounds like your father.

221
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,660

Hey,Ma.

222
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,480
如果你打开电脑 我们可以视频

我可不会靠近那怪东西

我会中电脑病毒的!
I'll catch a computer virus!

225
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,520
你中不了电脑病毒
You can't catch a computer virus.

226
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,500
这么说除了是宇航员 你还是医生?
Oh,so now you're an astronaut  and  a doctor?

227
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,510
什么事 妈?
What do you want,Ma?

228
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,830
你老婆说 你有事要告诉我
Your wife says you have something important to tell me.

229
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,950

你真要离开我!
You  are  gonna leave me!

233
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,120
妈...
Ma...

234
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,600

235
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,220
你爸离开了我 你离开我 我想我就是天生遭人弃的命
Your father left me,you left me-- I guess I'm just the kind of person people like to leave.

236
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,180

It's not...

237
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,200

Don't bother.

239
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,420
我会找个地洞待着 死了不会麻烦别人
I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I'm no trouble when I die.

240
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,800

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,240
我就知道她是幕后主使!
I knew she was behind this!

244
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,150
听着 如果你是男人 就别受女人摆布
You listen to me,if you want to be a man,you can't let a woman tell you what to do!

245
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,640
好好
Okay,okay.

246
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,120
不敢相信他们这群人 竟然赢了冷战
I can't believe these people won the Cold War.

247
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,580

好 解释下为什么 那么久都没给我写封信
Fine. Explain why   you've been gone so long and I haven't gotten   a single letter.

249
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,390
连张破明信片都没有!
Not even a lousy postcard!

250
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,690
我开始喜欢橄榄球了
You know,I'm growing to like American football.

251
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,990
是啊 很有意思 不是吗?

252
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,020
嗯...
Well...

253
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,590
虽说没羽毛球或板球那么刺激 但嘿...
it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket,but hey...

254
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,410
其它哪有刺激的了?
what is?

255
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
好吧 谁还要喝?
All right,who's ready for another beer?

256
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,610

你们像我的家人一样
You guys are like family to me.

260
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,800
你知道的 对吧?
You know that,right?

261
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,110
很好 你可以走了
That's great.Get out.

262
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,290
什么? 为啥啊?
What? Why?

263
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,650
Penny和我有些事要谈
Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.

264
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,960
去你的破事吧!
Oh... pish on your issues!

265
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,520
你们没事
You guys are fine.

266
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,200
是的 你一路碰了些钉子
Yes,you hit some bumps along the way.

267
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,160
Penny 你一向知道这家伙对你有意思 但你却让他一直很卑微
I mean,Penny,you've always known how this man has felt about you,but you made him grovel for affection.

268
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,100
好吧 等等...
Okay,hold on...

269
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,400
不用自责
Now,don't blame yourself.

270
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,500
他卑微习惯了
He was a groveler from way back.

271
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,350
重点是 你们都走过来了
But the point is,the two of you got past it.

272
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,330
Leonard你在做爱时 向这可怜的女孩儿求婚?
And,Leonard,you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex?

273
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,470
这都可以醒酒了
That was some weak tea,dude.

274
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,280
某些人会认为这样很浪漫
Some people might say it was romantic.

275
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,050
真的吗 不可能
Yeah,no.

276
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,530
但只要你们还在一起
But yet,here you two are,still together.

277
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,180
尽管我俩还有过疯狂裸体夜
And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.

278
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,190
- 好了... - 闭嘴
- Okay... - That's enough.

279
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,960
我是说 看你们经历了那么多
I'm just saying that after everything you've been through,

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,330
你们得深情对视 互诉爱意
you get to look into each other's eyes and say "I love you."

281
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,840
这才叫浪漫
And that's beautiful.

282
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,040
事实上 时至今日 她都没对我说过
Actually,to this day,she's never really said it.

283
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,720
Penny 这也太荒唐了
Oh,Penny!That's ridiculous!

284
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,880
你知道你是爱他的
You know you love him!

285
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,460
看着他的眼睛说我爱你
You look him in the eyes and you say it.

286
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,510
- Raj... - 快说吧 你知道你想说的
- Raj... - Oh,come on,you know you want to say it.

287
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,400
说出来 说你爱他
Say it. Say you love him.

288
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,650
说啊
Say it!

289
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,030
我真心以为她会说的
I really thought she would say it.

290
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,390
我之前有跟你说过 你像只性感的螳螂吗
Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?

每次你喝了酒都这么说

292
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,100
你知道螳螂有什么迷人之处吗

293

你知道吗
You know what?

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,350
我们受够了
I'm done with this.

299
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,610
你要去哪儿
W-Where are you going?

300
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,830
我要离开了

Amy 当你我目光对视的刹那
Amy... when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine,

一切事物都不再平凡
everything feels not quite normal,

310
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,320
因为我既感到强大 又感到弱小
because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time.

311
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:01,820
既兴奋又惊恐
I feel excited and,at the same time,terrified.

事实上 我已不清楚我的感受

还真是
Amen to that.

337
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,890
有时我会往狗狗的餐盘里 倒点夏敦埃酒
Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog's water bowl.

338
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,170
开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

339
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,380

这拉丁的曲子让我觉得 身处里约的沙滩上
Latin music just makes me feel like I'm on a white sand beach in Rio.

347
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,840
是啊
