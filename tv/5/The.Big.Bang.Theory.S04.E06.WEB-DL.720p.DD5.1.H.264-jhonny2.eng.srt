1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,180
Problem?

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,450
This is the worst
cobbler I've ever eaten.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,451
{\a7}***

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,580
It tastes like it's made of
actual ground-up shoemaker.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,790
Amusing.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,520
A play on the two meanings of "cobbler."

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,440
Hey,guys.Guess who I found at LAX?

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,940
- My baby sister Priya.
- Excuse me,I object.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,090
You propose a guessing game,yet you
don't give me enough time to guess.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,450
For the record,I was going
to say: "Your sister Priya."

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,940
Oh,Sheldon. You haven't
changed a bit,have you?

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,000
Why would I change?

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,230
The hope has been that you'd
eventually bend to public opinion.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,070
So,Priya,what brings you back to L.A.?

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,440
I have a one-day layover
on my way to Toronto.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,050
- Corporate merger.
- Can you believe it?

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,690
Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys
for the biggest car company in India.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,210
Given that when we met her,she
was finishing law school

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,920
and planning an internship at a large Indian
car company,it's actually extremely plausible.

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,500
And your poll numbers
just keep dropping.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,020
I want to catch up with all of you,but
first I really must visit the loo.

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,230
I'm going,too; I'll
show you where it is.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,680
All right,this goes without saying,but
I'm just going to say it anyway.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,900
Hands off my sister.

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,200
Why would I touch her?She's
covered with airplane germs.

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,270
I'm so not talking to
you.I'm talking to him.

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,070
I've got a girlfriend now.

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,100
Oh,please.My sister's much hotter
than your girlfriend,and you know it.

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,760
Let's just agree they're both hot.

30
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,430
But dude,that's my sister
you're talking about!

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,630
Okay,forget who's hotter.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,380
The first time Priya came to L.A.,Leonard and
I made a pact out of respect to our friendship

33
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,040
and to you that neither
of us would hit on her.

34
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,180
Did you pinky-swear?

35
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,120
Yes.

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,860
Okay,then.

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,170
Cobbler.I'm still laughing.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,970
It's really nice to
see you again,Leonard.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,240
Yeah.It's good to see you,too.

40
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,570
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,950
Okay.

42
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,700

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,130
So you got any special
plans with your sister?

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,010
Oh,not really.Just hang out.

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,500
I always tell people,"If you have only
one day in Los Angeles,make it a train day.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,070
" Train day?

49
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,450
The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio
City,

50
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:02,017
a hotdog stand in a converted railroad dining car

51
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:07,140
Next stop,Travel Town,an outdoor
museum featuring 43 railroad engines,

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,670
cars,and other rolling stock
from the 1880s to the 1930s.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,630
And,finally,we're off to the
glitz and glamour of Hollywood,

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,170
for dinner
at--that's right--

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,180
the Hollywood Carney's,a hotdog stand in
a differentconverted railroad dining car.

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,770
I don't think we're going to do that.

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,610
Well,then apparently you hate fun.

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,120
Priya's not back yet?

59
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,830
Well,I guess that's not unusual.

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,110
Women,men,the whole
sitting-standing deal.

61
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,320
So what are we talking about?

62
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,210
- Uh,my plans with Priya.
- He rejected Train Day.

63
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,870
Did you make it clear that it's two different
train cars turned into hotdog stands?

64
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,860
Abundantly.

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,680
I guess he just hates fun.

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,250
That's what I said!

67
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,040
Okay,so... what's new with you guys?

68
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,300
- I have a girlfriend now.
- Hey,good for you!

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,970
Yeah,I just want to put it out there in case I
inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction.

70
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,990
Happy?

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,750
So,Priya,what are your
plans while you're here?

72
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,360
I don't know.I just have the one day.

73
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,110
Do you like trains?

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,210
Not particularly.

75
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,540
You might as well just wait
at the airport for your flight.

76
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,190
"You are in a forest.

77
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,760
"There is quicksand to the
west,a path leads to the east."

78
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,740
Go east.

79
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,190
"An iron gate blocks your way."

80
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,550
Open gate.

81
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,790
"It's locked."

82
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,760
Well,so much for that.

83
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,950
It's getting pretty late.How
come you're still up?

84
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,240
I found an emulator online that lets you play
classic text-based computer games from the 1980s.

85
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,360
- That's pretty cool.
- Oh,yes.

86
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,510
It runs on the world's most
powerful graphics chip: imagination.

87
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,160
You've really got to get out more.

88
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,170
Go north.

89
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,310
"You can't go that way."

90
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,280
Go west.

91
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,430
"A troll blocks your passage."

92
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,180
Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

93
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,500
Kill troll.

94
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,770
"With what?"With sword.

95
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,320
"You don't have the sword."

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,570
Good golly,it's as if it's
actually happening to me.

97
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,380
Raj finally went to bed.

98
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,230
Sheldon's still up.

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,680
You said he goes to bed at 9:00.

100
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,300
Yeah,he does,but he got caught
up in a computer game and...

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,350
Hit troll with axe!Hit troll with axe!

102
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,010
Hit troll with axe!

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,050
My,this is one tough troll.

104
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,260
Can't you get rid of him?

105
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,290
If the past is any indication,no.

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,290
Leonard,I'm trapped in quicksand!The
axe is dragging me down!

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,970
- Drop axe!
- Drop axe,brilliant!

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,290
Give me a minute.

109
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,480
- Sheldon.
- Hold on.

110
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,060
Trying to figure out how to get the
bucket,so I can carry the mud past the dragon.

111
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,570
Sheldon,you need to work in the morning.

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,320
- I know!
- Well,then bed,mister!

113
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,520
Five more minutes!

114
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,630
Really?

115
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,260
You're going to risk getting sleepy in the
middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar?

116
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,450
You know what happens
when you yawn in public.

117
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,450
Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.

118
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,060
You don't want that,do you?

119
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,260
No.

120
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,940
But it's a shame our society
mocks the differently uvulated.

121
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,320
Who was at the door?

122
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,090
Uh,building manager.

123
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,740
They have to fix a pipe,so the water'll
be off tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

124
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,570
That's unacceptable.We're supposed
to be given written notice.

125
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,780
Well,no,it doesn't
matter-- we'll be at work.

126
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,290
What if I spill tomato soup on my
shirt,and have to come home to change,

127
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,200
only to find there's no
water for an enzyme soak?

128
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,010
Bifurcated uvula,Sheldon!

129
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,780
I'll have the chicken noodle.Good night!

130
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,410
We're going to have to be very quiet.

131
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,640
I know how to get the bucket!

132
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,550
I can turn the axe around and
use the handle to reach it.

133
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,670
Let's see.

134
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,180
Go north.

135
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,550
"You are in a forest."

136
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,120
Go north.

137
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,510
"You are in a forest."

138
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,880
Go north.

139
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,100
"You are in a forest."

140
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,650
Oh dear,I believe I'm lost.

141
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,180
Well,I'll just have to
get a fresh start tomorrow.

142
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,980
No,no,no!You just took a wrong
turn.You just need to map it out.

143
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,520
Come on,I'll help you.So you stopped at
the stream,and you turned north three times?

144
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,420
- Yes.
- You're right.You're lost.Good luck.

145
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,260
Leonard. Wake up.

146
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,190
- Huh? Wha--Sorry.-
For what?

147
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,610
I don't know.When I'm in bed with a
girl,it's just-- it's my go-to response.

148
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,540
It's 6:00.I have to get back to Raj's
before he wakes up and realizes I'm gone.

149
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,870
Right. Sure.

150
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,550
I wish you could stay
in L.A. a while longer.

151
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,980
Mmm,me,too.

152
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,650
You know,I was thinking: There are
some great research facilities in India.

153
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,170
Where are you going with this,Leonard?

154
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,460
Well,I'm just saying,you know,I
don't have any real ties here,

155
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,100
so if I were to move to New
Delhi,we could,you know--

156
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,400
go out.

157
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,100
Leonard,didn't we have this
conversation five years ago?

158
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,300
Well,yes,but... things have changed.

159
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,560
You know,you're older,I'm older--
Look,no more superhero bed sheets.

160
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,240
Sweetheart,just because we have fun when I come to
town doesn't mean I want to have a serious relationship.

161
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,170
It doesn't?

162
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,050
And besides,I could never bring
a white boy home to my parents.

163
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,110
They'd have a cow.

164
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,010
Which is a much bigger deal in India.

165
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,080
I'm not that white.

166
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,990
My great-great-grandmother
was half Cherokee.

167
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,890
I know that's not the right kind
of Indian,but it is something.

168
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,580
You're funny.

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,560
Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

170
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,710
- What?
- I heard a woman laughing.

171
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,140
Oh,uh,yeah.

172
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,130
I was trying to see if
I could laugh as a woman.

173
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,540
Well,good job.Quite convincing.

174
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,940
I smell perfume.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,330
Air freshener.

176
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,110
And is that lipstick
on your cheek and neck?

177
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,080
Rash. That's a bad rash.

178
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:03,200
My sympathies.I'm no stranger to the
crimson scourge that is dermatitis.

179
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,000
Can I interest you in a topical steroid
from my lotion and unguent collection?

180
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,870
Uh,yeah,yeah,that sounds great.

181
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,710
Very well.I'm sure I can find something
that will help you ditch that itch.

182
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,770
Okay,he's in the bathroom.Let's go.

183
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,260
Do you prefer ointment or cream?

184
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,740
- Cream.
- With or without a numbing agent?

185
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,680
- Without.
- Really,Leonard?

186
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,290
There are no heroes when
it comes to dermatitis.

187
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,250
Fine. With.

188
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,760
- Prescription or non-prescription
strength?- Use your best judgment.

189
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,370
Well,I think I have a
nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

190
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:52,100
It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed hemorrhoids,but
it also goes nicely with non-mucosal body parts.

191
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,780
Sounds great.

192
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,760
Excellent choice.

193
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,150
Okay,hurry,hurry,hurry.

194
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,290
Come on,come on,come on.

195
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,820
Priya?

196
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,140
Good morning,Sheldon.

197
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,770
For shame,Leonard,for shame.

198
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,850
And to think,I was ready to waste the
last of my good hemorrhoid cream on you.

199
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,060
Making pretty good time,huh?

200
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,790
Is that really what you
want to talk about,Leonard?

201
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,360
- No.
- What do you want to talk about?

202
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,350
Please don't tell anyone I spent
the night with Raj's sister.

203
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,160
There it is.

204
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,900
What if someone asks?

205
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,810
No one's going to ask if I spent
the night with Raj's sister.

206
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,850
Perhaps,but they might
ask me something else.

207
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,630
Like what?

208
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,850
Like "Has Leonard betrayed
any of his friends recently?"

209
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,940
Priya and I are both adults.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,490
I didn't betray Raj.

211
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,170
In fact,you did,but I
was referring to Howard.

212
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,090
- What are you talking about?
- April 12,2005.

213
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,990
Bob's Big Boy,Toluca Lake.

214
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,480
Raj had just introduced us
to Priya for the first time.

215
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:20,040
She was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion
in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger.

216
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,100
In order to preserve your friendship,you
and Howard made a pinky swear

217
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,240
that neither of you
would attempt to woo her.

218
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,010
I had a patty melt.

219
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,770
Okay,fine,I betrayed Howard.

220
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
- And Raj.
- All right,and Raj.

221
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,670
- And me.
- You?

222
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,340
Violation of the Roommate Agreement's
overnight guest notification clause.

223
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,790
Okay,fine,I-I'm a horrible human being.

224
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,090
I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

225
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,370
You're far too short to be Darth Vader.

226
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,820
At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.

227
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,821
{\a7}**

228
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,970
My point is: Priya's gone and it would be
much better if no one else found out about us.

229
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,510
You mean you want me to keep a secret?

230
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,000
- Yes.
- You know I can't keep a secret.

231
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,430
You can if you try.Think
about it this way:

232
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,730
um,if I were Batman and you were
Alfred,you'd keep that secret,right?

233
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,270
Why do you get to be Batman?

234
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,060
Because Batman has the secret.

235
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,710
- Alfred has secrets,too.
- Like what?

236
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,800
Alfred knows that
Barbara Gordon is Batgirl.

237
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,870
Which I've now just told to
Batman.See,I cannot keep a secret.

238
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,180
Ta-dah!

239
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,520
What?

240
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,650
Ta-dah.

241
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,220
It's short for...

242
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,790
Kind of busy here,Sheldon.

243
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,230
I know,that's why I shortened it.

244
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,750
What do you want?

245
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,780
I came to go over your
alibi for last night.

246
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
What alibi?

247
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,070
You've asked me to lie on
your behalf,and as you know,

248
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,090
I am deeply uncomfortable
with impromptu dishonesty,

249
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,480
so I've provided you
with an ironclad alibi.

250
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,370
You couldn't have spent last night with
Priya because you were with another woman.

251
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,690
Oh,I'm so sure I'm gonna
regret this,but who was I with?

252
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,150
The fun-loving and morally
loose Miss Maggie McGarry.

253
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,940
Oh,God.

254
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,480
You met her at Pasadena's most popular
Irish watering hole,Lucky Baldwin's,

255
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,830
where Maggie spends her nights tending bar with
a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.

256
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,150
"Leonard,call me if you
are interested in coitus.

257
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,820
Sincerely,Maggie McGarry.

258
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,790
" And if anyone were to actually
call that number,they will hear this.

259
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,560
Top of the morning to you.

260
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,140
You've reached Maggie McGarry.

261
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,940
Leave a message after
the wee little beep.

262
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,000
It's pretty convincing,huh?

263
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,620
That wasn't even a real person.

264
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,120
And here is the clincher: a lock
of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.

265
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,990
- Where'd you get that?
- From an orangutan in the primate lab.

266
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,230
An orangutan?

267
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,330
Well,no one's going to run
a DNA test on it,Leonard.

268
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,560
Honestly,you overthink everything.

269
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,770
Sheldon,I don't need an alibi.

270
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,120
Nobody's going to ask about last
night as long as you just zip your lip.

271
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,290
Thank you.

272
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,330
Now,don't worry,everything
is going to be fine.

273
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,250
***

274
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,200
Hey,Leonard,will you please tell Howard
my sister has never been attracted to him?

275
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,810
Come on,Raj,how am I supposed to know who
she is attracted to or was attracted to

276
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,310
or who she might be
attracted to in the future?

277
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,760
And I have nothing to
contribute to this conversation.

278
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,720
Because I,too,know absolutely nothing about
Priya's preferences in male companionship.

279
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,850
And with that,I will re-zip my lip.

280
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,860
Hey,so what did you guys think of
the new episode of Caprica last night?

281
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,480
- I didn't see it.
- Didn't see it?

282
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,280
What were you doing?

283
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,390
Uh,I was out.

284
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,310
<i>What,on Caprica night?</i>

285
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,130
Yeah,I,uh,went for a drink.

286
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,460
Really,you?

287
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,230
Where,w-where'd you go?

288
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,590
To,uh...

289
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,970
Lucky Baldwin's.

290
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,030
Oh,I've heard of that place.

291
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,480
Isn't that Pasadena's
favorite Irish watering hole?

292
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,050
Yes.

293
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,400
Did you meet anyone interesting
there,perhaps a promiscuous,redheaded barmaid?

294
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,790
As a matter of fact... I-I-I-I-I
can't,I can't,I can't do it.

295
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,020
Sure you can,you're doing
fine,it's very believable.

296
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm sorry,Raj,but the truth
is,I was with Priya last night.

297
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,710
Don't listen to him.

298
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,220
He's still light-headed from all the Irish
whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.

299
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,340
What were you doing with Priya?

300
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,590
I believe they engaged in
coitus,but more importantly,

301
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,270
if Leonard had not abandoned his
story,would you have found it plausible?

302
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,440
You slept with my sister?!

303
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,210
- Yeah.
- How could you?We had a pact.

304
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,458
Excuse me,I think "How could you?

305
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:33,120
She's my sister" takes precedence
over a five-year-old pinky swear.

306
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,562
May I point out,in a parallel universe,

307
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:39,563
your friends are saying
"Maggie McGarry-- she sounds lovely.

308
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,350
" Look,I-I admit it,I may
have crossed a line here,

309
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,740
but come on,Raj,your
sister is a grown woman,

310
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,790
and to her,I'm a forbidden
piece of white chocolate.

311
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,960
I don't believe it.This is a
terrible betrayal of my trust.

312
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,541
No,w-w-would it help if I told you that

313
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:58,423
I offered her my heart,
and she kind of stomped on it?

314
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,340
How hard did she stomp?

315
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,450
Very hard.

316
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,850
Okay,I'm good.

317
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,390
Well,Raj,I just want to say
that I'd never betray your trust.

318
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,170
Unlike Leonard,I respect you.

319
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,580
Really?

320
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,978
Was it out of respect that...

321
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:24,605
you didn't tell Raj about the time
you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?

322
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,540
Dude,I put that thing on my face!

323
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,430
I think a more amusing
violation of Raj's trust is

324
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,090
when Howard convinced him that foreigners
give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.

325
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,890
Hey,I didn't see you giving
back your Snoopy snow cone maker.

326
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,620
That was all a lie?This year's
gifts are already wrapped.

327
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,130
And as long as we're talking
about betraying our friends,

328
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,380
how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up
insects and mixing them into Leonard's food?

329
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,160
Well,excuse me.

330
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,590
That was not a betrayal.

331
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,910
That was an experiment to determine at what
concentration food starts tasting "mothy."

332
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,930
You put moths in my food?!

333
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,340
For science.

334
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,320
I can't believe you kissed
my sister with moth mouth.

335
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,550
Well,I can't believe you
used Sheldon's toothbrush.

336
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,590
You used my toothbrush?

337
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,049
Not the brush part

338
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,748
just the little rubber thing
to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.

339
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,890
Okay,I-I think it's safe to say that we've all
done some things we're not particularly proud of.

340
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,790
But come on,we're friends.

341
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,450
Friends overlook each
other's minor lapses.

342
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,190
For the record,Howard,I'm
sorry that I broke our pact.

343
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,030
Thank you.

344
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,860
And I'm sorry about your
phone and Thanksgiving.

345
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,320
And while we're at it,you don't have to
wash our clothes on the Fourth of July.

346
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,110
As long as we're apologizing,Sheldon,I'm,I'm
sorry I used your toothbrush.

347
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,260
And I'm sorry...

348
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,720
but that behavior is beyond the
pale and cannot be tolerated.

349
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,070
We are no longer friends.

350
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,250
I got you a talking Thomas the
Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

351
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,930
With real puffing smoke?

352
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,120
Yes.

353
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,750
All right.

354
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,090
But I'm watching you.

355
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,430
Hey,you've got Snoopy
out.Can I have a snow cone?

356
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,460
Well,sure.

357
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,590
This is pretty good.What flavor is this?

358
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,460
Guess.

359
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,550
- Papaya?
- No.

360
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,550
Guava?

361
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,480
You're so close.

362
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,630
I give up.

363
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,100
Mango caterpillar.

364
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,500
What are you doing?!

365
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,960
<font color=#78ec1b>-=http://bbs.sfileydy.com=-

366
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,930
You said you liked it.
