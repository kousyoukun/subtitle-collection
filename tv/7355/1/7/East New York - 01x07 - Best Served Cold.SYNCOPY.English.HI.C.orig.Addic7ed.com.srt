00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:26,875
I might have.
I'm not a very good driver.

160

KILLIAN: What about the
people that work for you?

161
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:31,673
Have you had to fire anyone recently?

162
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:33,600
Can I let you in on a little secret?

163
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,661
I never fire anyone.

164
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,422
It's one of the reasons I was
never made regional manager.

165
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:39,849
Too soft.

166
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:44,701
Well... just so you know,
we have a suspect in custody.

167
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:48,305
Does the name Antonia Ortiz ring a bell?

168
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:51,074
I dated a woman named Antonia Ortiz.

169
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,101
If it's the same one.

170
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:54,480
What could you tell us about her?

171
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,955
It's not like I really
know her, you know?

172
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,590
We only went out once or twice.

173
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,091
From what I remember, she was nuts.

174
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:00,504
Nuts how?

175
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,594
I don't know if she's actually bi-polar,

176
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:05,522
but she flip-flops
from one thing to another.

177
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,325
Affectionate one minute.

178
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:11,787
Revolted by my very existence the next.

179
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:15,622
Well, when you're feeling up to it,

180
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,277
we're gonna need you to pick
her out of some photographs.

181
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,603
- Sure.
- Then if it goes

182
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:22,197
to trial, they're gonna
need you to testify.

183
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,043
Meantime you've got her locked up?

184
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,203
Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,368
Good.

186
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,111
Keep her that way.

187
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:31,038
Yeah, you got it.

188
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,954
- He's lying.
- He might be lying.

189
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,281
The doctor said the entry
wound was from the front.

190
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,008
He said he felt like he'd
been stabbed in the back.

191
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:45,962
Well, it's possible there's sensory
confusion, given the circumstances.

192
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,497
In other words, you want
her to be lying. Is that right?

193
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:50,437
I don't want anyone
to be lying, Crystal.

194
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,330
But there's no corroboration.

195
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,490
No physical evidence.
Okay? We have to allow

196
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,450
for the possibility that
one of them is lying.

197
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,077
Okay, you be sure and keep
that possibility alive.

198
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:00,701
I don't get why you're so upset.

199
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:03,326
'Cause there are very few things
that irritate me as much

200
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:05,420
as excessive even-handedness.

201

can we have that?

I ordered turkey and Swiss.

00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,342
Yeah.

209
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,514
- You ever been to Primanti's?
- Mm-mm.

210
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,256
Great hero sandwiches.

211
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:40,183
- Where is it?
- Pittsburgh.

212
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,953
Oh, that's, that's really helpful.

213
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,022
Don't-don't do that. I'm just
recalling great sandwiches

214
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:47,065
from the past. I thought
that's what we were doing.

215
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,625
That's not what we're doing.

216
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,894
We were complaining
about these sandwiches.

217
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,398
So, um... Why were you in Pittsburgh?

218
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,767
I was thinking of going
to Carnegie Mellon.

219
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,468
Really?

Lived in Ruskin Gardens with

Found in a dumpster at

That would qualify as
a cold case, wouldn't it?

the motions of opening
an investigation, so...

of intelligence-gathering.

235

So don't seem like that.

236
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:38,208
How am I supposed to seem?

237
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,078

How can I help you, Jack?

Oh, it seems as though
one of your detectives

used to be one of my detectives.

If you're talking about Crystal Morales,

251
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:11,192
I hope you're not asking for her back.

252
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:14,453
N... No, I'm definitely
not asking for her back.

253
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:15,529
- Oh.
- One of my people

254
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:18,411
threw up a flare that
she was trying to access files.

255
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,021
Well, there was a shoo... Please.

256
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:21,193
Oh, thank you.

257
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,794
There was a shooting at
a supermarket this morning.

258
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:26,786
I understand it relates
to a rape investigation

259
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:28,732
from when she was at Special Victims.

260
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:30,902
I'm sure you realize
that Special Victims cases

261
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:32,951
are of a particularly sensitive nature.

262
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:33,997
Absolutely.

263
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:35,490
Access on a need-to-know basis only.

264
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:39,077
Detectives are generally
encouraged to share files.

265
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,604
Depends what they want to do with them.

266
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,607
Seems to me that Detective Morales

267
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,883
wants to make Special Victims
out to be negligent

268
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:47,077
or callous in their treatment
of a rape victim.

269
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:49,871
No, I don't think that's
what's motivating her at all.

270
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,190
Why don't we bring the introductory part

271
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,384
of this conversation
to a close, Inspector?

272
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,427
Morales made her feelings about the men

273
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,927
and women in Special Victims
pretty clear before she left.

274
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,421
But as long as I'm in charge,
they're not gonna be made

275
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,763
into punching bags
for her righteous indignation

276
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,646
that a wobbling acquaintance
rape case didn't go the distance.

277
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:10,341
SVD files will not be provided
for Crystal Morales's perusal.

278
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:12,195
And you can tell her I said so.

279
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,588
I will.

280
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,155
I don't mean to be coming down
on you about this.

281
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,138
No, look, Jack, it's all right, please.

282
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:20,842

to protect our people,

answer for decisions
that weren't ours to make

285
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,421
and live and die by how
many cases we clear each month.

286
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:30,027
Yeah. It's... it's a lot to ask.

287
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,721
You know... Anyway.

He give you his speech
about protecting his people?

296
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,659
He's entitled
to protect the confidentiality

297
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:02,333
of his case files, Detective.

298
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:04,826
- Protect them from whom?
- Especially if there isn't

299

a legitimate purpose being
served by sifting through them.

in East New York.

319
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,327
- Hopefully it's only temporary.
- Couldn't be

320
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,265
temporary enough from where I'm sitting.

322
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:15,149

- Yeah, you two.

how about you take a case off my hands?

327
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:23,353
If it's something
you think I can handle.

328
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:26,081
Oh, sure, sure, sure. It's a cold case

329

Some skel who lived in Ruskin Gardens.

331
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:31,017
Got a couple of uniforms
living over there.

332
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,178
Might want to start by talking to them.

333
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:36,314
See you in the interview room.
I got to hit the head.

334
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:40,931
You pick the 7-4 just to wind him up?

335
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,388
The fact you were here might've
had something to do with it.

Oh, God, you're one of those.

340
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,884
I didn't get him after all?

341
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:58,751
No, it's lucky for you
all you did was wound him.

342
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:00,704
I didn't even hurt him that much.

Antonia...

345
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:07,868
you're gonna be charged
with attempted murder.

346
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,295
They could put you away for 15 years.

347
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,288
Had I killed him,
it would have been worth it.

348
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:13,892
I don't think so.

349
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:17,962
After the seasons came once or twice
with you still inside...

350
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:21,203
I'm sure you'd come to feel
that nothing was worth it.

351
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,564
He changed my life, Crystal.

352
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:29,033
I was one person before he did that
to me and I'm another person after.

353
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:31,127
I believe you.

354
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,187
I know you do.

355
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,974
The one thing that kept me
going was that you believed me.

356
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,376
And I didn't hold it against you that...

357
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:39,603
it wasn't enough.

358
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,264
We didn't have a suspect back then.

359
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,876
Um... how'd you find this guy?

360
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,248
I had stopped going to the market.

361
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,298
I had stopped doing anything.

362
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:54,559
One day my nephews were coming over,

363
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:57,001
I had to get some stuff and I...

364
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,695
saw his picture on the wall.

365
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,838
He's a manager there.

366
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,535
I struck up conversation
with someone who worked there,

367
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:06,471
and she told me he'd been transferred
to the East New York location.

368
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:08,650
Who was it you struck up
a conversation with?

369
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,151
Uh, her name was Yolanda Evans.

370
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,579
She was an assistant manager
at the Gowanus store.

371
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,284
Oh, when I saw his picture...

372
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,920
when I finally knew his name...

373
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:25,089
it's like everything came into focus.

374
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,926
Suddenly I had a purpose.

375
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,788
I tracked him.

376
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,865
I knew what time he got to work,
what time he got out.

377
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,501
I read up,
and I got a .38 caliber revolver,

378
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,103
'cause I thought it would have
been easier to handle.

379
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,439
Turns out it wasn't
as easy as I thought.

380
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:43,868
I took my shot and just ran.

381
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:46,119
What did you talk
to Yolanda Evans about?

382
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:47,853
I told her that I knew him from college

383
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:49,413
and I just wanted to get in touch.

384
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:52,415
She told me not to trust him.

385

Detective Killian, Morales.

You work here when Reid Kissoon
was the general manager?

You here on account
of some woman shot him?

401
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:34,048
She said you directed her to the store

402
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:35,528
that was opening in East New York.

403
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:36,921
I didn't know she was gonna shoot him.

404
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,181
And nobody said you did.

405
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,774
Can you tell us anything about him?

406
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,368
He was a little pervy.

407
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:42,728
But as long as he gave me

408
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,411
halfway decent hours
and kept his hands to himself,

409
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:46,671
I got along with him.

410
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:48,106
How was he pervy?

411
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,732
His whole thing with the cameras.

412
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:55,046

here, staring up at the screen.

414

a pretty girl on camera,
he wouldn't take his eyes off her.

415
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,606
Sometimes he'd say to me,

416
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:03,699
"What do you think of her, Yolanda?"

417
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,535

794
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,029
But to keep it straight,

795
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:46,226
you admit having had sexual relations

796
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:49,187
with Antonia Ortiz,
but you maintain it was consensual?

797
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:50,296
In all respects.

798
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:52,921
- What about Penelope Vega?
- Wow!

799
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:55,421
They're coming out
of the woodwork, aren't they?

800
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:58,952
Well, Penelope Vega and Antonia Ortiz
have the same account.

801
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,945
You know, drink at the bar,
follow 'em home,

802
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,472
push in the front door behind 'em.

803
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:03,965
MORALES: And according to your doctor,

804
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,092
the exit wound was in the back.

805
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,768
You were shot in the front.

806
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:11,516
You know what, I'm done
talking to the two of you.

807
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,800
Yeah, I'm sure you're tired. You know,

808
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,745
and the last thing we want to do is
put you through any further strain.

809
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,556
But the thing is, when two
incidents closely resemble each other,

810
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,191
we look for a pattern.

811
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:22,726
MORALES: You want
to tell us how many times

812
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,874
that pattern was repeated?

813
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:24,934
I don't know what you're talking about.

814
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,822
How many were there, Reid?
How many women did you rape?

815
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:29,282
I...

816
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,209
You can't prove
that I raped any of them.

817

MORALES: We have a DNA match

819
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:35,573
- from Penelope Vega.
- What?

820
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,515
KILLIAN: The ring she
scratched your face with,

821
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,608
and the gauze your gunshot wound
was bandaged with

822
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,187
are a perfect match with the rape kit.

823
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:42,904
MORALES: The only
question is whether or not

824
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:45,932
you want to come clean
about anyone else.

825
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:50,350
What I want is a lawyer.

826

You can't do this.
Get me my lawyer. Now!

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

831

They're gonna take you
over to arraignment.

832
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:23,795
There'll be a bail hearing.

833
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,194
Given that you're employed,

834
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,452
and you have ties to the community,
it's possible they'll release you

835
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,403
on your own recognizance.

836
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:34,898
Past that, you need a good lawyer.

837
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:36,734
Any suggestions?

838
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,710
There's a few I can think of.

839
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:41,696
They'll bring it to the court's
attention that you were in fact raped,

840
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:45,909
and that your rapist has been arrested
for a similar crime.

841
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:48,468
Whether you plead temporary insanity

842

or PTSD, there's a chance you
won't have to do any jail time at all.

he raped another woman.

I'm sure a thorough investigation

I know you would have caught him

Yeah. I wish that would have

I guess I do.

to move into the projects?

No.

I am wishing I was more
sure of myself, though.

As far as what goes?

You live somewhere, you find things out.

866
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:44,885
You know, things that
you would never find out

867
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,012
if you just worked in that place.

868
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:50,840
I mean, you get to know these people
because they're your neighbors.

869
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:53,868
So you act like their neighbor,
and then...

870
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,481
you come into a piece of information,

871
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,085
and you're supposed to act like a cop.

872

Figure out who killed Shuggie Adams?

873
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:05,884
I figured out that
where his body was dumped

874
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:09,609
makes it seem likely that one
of those neighbors killed him.

875
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:12,788
You know, I locked up Shuggie
Adams two or three times.

876
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,982
And I also think I got
a pretty good idea who shot him.

877
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,250
We make these decisions every day

That's the job.

00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,530
Yeah, and no one tells us that
these are our decisions to make,

881
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:30,457
but sometimes they are.

882
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,351
That's right, sometimes they are.

883
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:34,912
So how do you know?

884
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:38,007

you've made the right decision?

Then ask yourself
who are you working for?

890

I saw what Shuggie Adams did
to all the people around him.

And I promise you, it's a
better place with him gone.

Wait, wait, wait. You didn't tell me...

893
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:08,164
You didn't tell me what to do.

894
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,390
Oh, yeah, I did.

SANDEFORD: You working
out of the Squad here?

898
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,562
For the time being. Officer Quinlan
found guns in an elevator shaft.

If it ain't one thing it's two, huh?

901
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:23,359
TROY: (LAUGHS) That's right.

902
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,529
Anything come to light
about that homicide?

903
00:38:29,512 --> 00:38:32,114
No. I-I put some feelers out,
but nothing came back.

904
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:36,539
Yeah, I kind of figured nothing would.

905
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:52,793
- Detective.
- Chief.

906
00:38:52,818 --> 00:38:55,421
Please. Uh, thanks for coming down here.

907
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:57,359
I know it's been a long day.

908
00:38:57,384 --> 00:38:58,852
Am I in trouble?

909
00:38:58,877 --> 00:38:59,952
Not as far as I'm concerned.

00:38:59,977 --> 00:39:01,577
She in any kind of trouble
with you, Regina?

911
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:02,734
Far from it.

912
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,361
So, then, why am I here?

913
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:08,924
I don't usually get summoned
to the Borough Commander's office.

914
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,109
It took guts to do
what you did, Detective.

915
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:12,636
I've seen how you work.

916
00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:14,952
I know how frustrated you must have been

917
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,747
- at Special Victims.
- That's why I left.

918
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,710
Detective, the job doesn't appreciate

919
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,825
having its failures held up
to the light of day.

920
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,630
Which means sometimes
they shoot the messenger.

921
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,792
Want to propose something
to you, Detective.

922
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:30,460
And I want you to understand

923
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:33,507
you are free to decline
this proposition.

924
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,554
I understand.

925
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,172
I have a friend over at DOJ

926
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,332
whom I've known for a long time.

927
00:39:38,357 --> 00:39:40,922
If an investigation into the practices

928
00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:43,281
over at Special Victims is warranted,

929
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:46,750
there is no one who I would
trust more to conduct it.

930
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,657

931
00:39:48,682 --> 00:39:50,488
might not be a good career move.

932
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,438
Is that the kind of thing
you'd worry about?

933
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:53,931
I'm in a different position.

934
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,899
You weren't always in
a different position, Inspector.

935
00:39:55,924 --> 00:39:58,060
SUAREZ: No, she wasn't.

936
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:06,258
I'll talk to whoever you think
I should talk to.

937
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,982
I thought we were doing this together.

938
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:18,946
Oh, no, we are.

939
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:20,773
Okay.

940
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,407
Do you think that we made a mistake?

941
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:30,801
- By agreeing to shovel mulch?
- No.

942
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:34,057
Moving into Ruskin Gardens.

943
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:37,594
I don't think it was a mistake, no.

944
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:42,633
Seems like it's
a worthwhile thing to do.

945
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:44,960
To try, at least.

946
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,158
It's pretty complicated.

947
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:51,453
As far as what you did
or didn't tell this detective?

948
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:53,780
Yeah, for starters.

949
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:56,874
I think you did the right thing

950
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:59,655
by not pointing him in the direction
of making Thora a suspect.
