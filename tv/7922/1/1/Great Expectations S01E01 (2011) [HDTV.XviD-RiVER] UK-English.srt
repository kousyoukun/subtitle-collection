1
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Come here.

2
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,640
Shut up. Shut up!

3
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,440
You scream again
and I'll cut your throat.

4
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,520
You understand? Do you understand!

5
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,600
Are you alone?

6
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Talk! Is anyone with you? You talk!

7
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,120
No-one.

8
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Where's your mother and father?

9
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,880
They're dead and buried.

10
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,760
Who are you living with?

11
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,920
Don't gawp at me, boy!
Who you living with?

12
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
My sister and Joe Gargery.

13
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,120
He a magistrate? A soldier?
What is this Joe Gargery?

14
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,160
He's a blacksmith!

15
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,640
A blacksmith.

16
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,480
Is he close by?

17
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,480
Is he close by?

18
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
The marsh road.

19
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,040
A blacksmith.

20
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,120
Do you know what a file is, boy?

21
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,600
This is what we're going to do.

22
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,880
You're going to run back to
Joe Gargery's forge.

23
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,320
And you're going to steal me a file.
I can't steal from Joe.

24
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,680
You're going to steal me a file
and bring it back here.

25
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,000
And if you breathe one word,
I'll know.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Do you know how I'll know?

27
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Cos I've got a friend, watching you.

28
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,320
He's watching you now. His eyes are
always on you. And he's a savage.

29
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,200
And you think of betraying me
and he'll get you,

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,200
he'll eat your tongue,
your liver and your lights.

31
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,040
He'll eat your beatin' heart
right in front of you.

32
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,240
Now, you go and fetch me that file
and you bring it back here. Get. Get!

33
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,200
What happened to you?

34
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,480
I fell over.

35
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,280
You're frozen. Get by the hearth.

36
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,320
The state of you! Slarted in filth!

37
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
Like I've not enough to do!
It's only a bit o'mud.

38
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,360
Let him 'ave his warm.

39
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,880
He can warm himself working.

40
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,520
Unless you want me to do it all
and wear my fingers to the knuckle?

41
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,640
Is that what you want, Mr. Gargery?

42
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,560
Your wife worn to nothing and at
Christmas too? No, Missus.

43
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,200
Coal! Now! And boots
off before you come in my parlour!

44
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Best go, Pip.
Afore she gets rampageous.

45
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,520
You are chilled to the bone, Uncle.

46
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,160
A hot gin
and water is what you need.

47
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,280
What are you doing down there?
Get up and fetch the gin.

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
I have some news, niece.
Wonderful news.

49
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,640
Who's died?

50
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,800
Better than death.

51
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,120
This concerns Miss Havisham
of Satis House!

52
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,360
Satis House.

53
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,160
She wants a boy.

54
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,200
And you have one.

55
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,360
Where's that gin?

56
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,920
Oh, Uncle Pumblechook!

57
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,000
I feel quite faint!
The room's spinning!

58
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,040
I didn't breathe a word!
I... I swear!

59
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,680
Come here!

60
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Come here!

61
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,400
I didn't tell, I promise.

62
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
D'you get the file?

63
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,400
The file, give us it.

64
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,920
Go on!

65
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,440
It's a bit crumbled from being
in my pocket.

66
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
D'you not want it?

67
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,520
I'll have it.

68
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,200
What do they call you?

69
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Philip Pirrip. But I get Pip.

70
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
Pip.

71
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Aren't you going to save
any for your friend?

72
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Nah, nah, he's not hungry.
He looks hungry.

73
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,000
You have to tell him
I didn't breathe a word.

74
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,520
Who looks hungry?

75
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,400
Your friend! The one with the scar.

76
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,600
Where was he?

77
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,360
He was waiting for me back yonder.

78
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,040
You run off home now, Pip.

79
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,400
Don't worry about him.

80
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
You run home, go on, fast... get!

81
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,920
Pip!

82
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,920
There'll be some sport this day.

83
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,360
A man-hunt with guns.

84
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,880
Well, they mighter caught you.
How'd you like that?

85
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,160
Gun at your head? Bang!

86
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Should hang 'em all. Hang 'em all
like rabbits. Their legs kicking.

87
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,960
Pip! Found 'im!

88
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,800
Didn't you hear the cannon?

89
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,760
There's been an escape,
there's convicts off the hulks!

90
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
You know not to go out
when there's a cannon!

91
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,080
Well, I... I lost my scarf.

92
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,560
I... I... I wanted to find my scarf.

93
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
I'm sorry,
Joe, I'm sorry for what I done.

94
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,880
Pip, old son, it's only a scarf.

95
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
Scarves get lost.

96
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Don't go crying over some old scarf.

97
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,320
Come on now. Let's get you home.

98
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,920
Good lad, Orlick.

99
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
All right.

100
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
Magwitch.

101
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,800
Teach you to get us
out on a day like this.

102
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,080
Drag him out, drag him out.

103
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,240
Did you see her yourself, Uncle?

104
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,520
Not in person - she's a lady.
But the message was from her.

105
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,080
As is the quality way.

106
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,400
I don't understand what Miss
'avisham wants a boy for.

107
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,320
That's not for us
to ask what a lady wants from a boy.

108
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,880
She wants a boy and dear
Uncle Pumblechook has spoken for us!

109
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,760
Ah! My food not good enough
for you?

110
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,080
It's Christmas, Missus.

111
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,920
If you can't beat a boy
at Christmas, when can you beat him?

112
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,520
That's right, Uncle. And you make a
better show of yourself

113
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,320
when you go up to the House.
Don't you go shaming me!

114
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,480
Us ain't decided
if he's going yet.

115
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,400
Of course he's going! It's Satis
House, Mr. Gargery! Satis House!

116
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,480
Think of what she could do for him!
For us!

117
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,040
For me! It could change
this family's fortunes.

118
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,880
Raised up, Mr. Gargery! All of us!
And who's to say where

119
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,560
we could be raised up to?
She ain't been seen for years.

120
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,600
Who's to say what she's like?
Well, he can tell us, can't he?

121
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,880
I would dearly like to see inside
that house.

122
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Do you want to go, Pip?
What you asking him for?

123
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,960
What he wants don't come into it!
He's going for me,

124
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,160
to make up for the mud and dirt
and the cleaning of wet clothes

125
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,560
and the toil and the care and the
drudgery

126
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,320
that goes with raising a boy
by hand in these freezing

127
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,560
god-forsaken flatlands with
thieves and villains running wild

128
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,040
as would murder us all in our beds,
he's going and there's an end to it!

129
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,480
I made something special, for you,
Uncle. To tempt you.

130
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,040
Oh, I couldn't.
I've the appetite of a bird.

131
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,480
Just a little morsel, Uncle.

132
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,520
It's your favourite, a mutton pie,
bursting with meat!

133
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,000
Missus!

134
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,240
Blacksmith, don't bother making
a new pin. Just solder 'em shut.

135
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,280
He can wear 'em the whole way.

136
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,800
What's he done, then?
Murderer, is it?

137
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,560
What ain't he done would take
less time to tell, Missus.

138
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,600
You see this. That's where you'll
end up.

139
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,160
Chained an' flogged an'
locked away, bringing shame on me.

140
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
Ain't nothing' to be a-feared of,
Pip.

141
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Filed 'em straight off. How d'you
do it? Someone help ya? Eh?

142
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Cos we'll bear down heavy
on 'em when they're caught.

143
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,680
No help. Then how d'you get
the file?

144
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,800
Hold him!

145
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,320
I pinched it off you, mister.
I pinched it off you.

146
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,880
You come in here?

147
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,760
I never noticed anything gone.

148
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,640
Well, you wouldn't.
Not with this one.

149
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,560
Varmint nonpareil, as they say.

150
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,000
Bound for the end of the world now.

151
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,640
If he makes it through the storms
and the sickness and the cramping.

152
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,800
Hold his leg.

153
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,600
He don't feel a thing.

154
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,280
I pinched somethin' else off you,
mister.

155
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
A bit of pie.

156
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,720
Oh, we've pie-stealing to add
to his list of felonies now!

157
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,640
And very tasty it was, Missus.

158
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,200
Best I ever had. You can bake.

159
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,800
Animal! You should hang!

160
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,760
Uncle! Don't touch that pie!

161
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,920
A dirty convict's
had his hands all over it!

162
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,360
You got in my 'ouse?

163
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880
I would say I was sorry but I ain't

164
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,000
cos I was hungry.

165
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, us
don't begrudge you a bit of pie.

166
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,720
Us don't begrudge no man a bite,
do us, Pip?

167
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,720
Blacksmith. Poor business, shacklin'
a man. I don't want paying' for it.

168
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,480
Right, well we'll drink to your
health then, blacksmith.

169
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,320
Good night, young 'un.
Merry Christmas!

170
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,000
All right, get him up, come on.

171
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,480
Come on, lads, give them
a kick if they don't step lively.

172
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,240
Don't slouch, boy!

173
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,680
And close your mouth.
You look soft-headed.

174
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,920
Whoa!

175
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,240
Good day to you, Hannah.

176
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,600
Tradesmen's is round
the back, as well you know.

177
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,640
I am expected.

178
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,920
He is. You're not.

179
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,400
This way.

180
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,760
Wait here.

181
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,440
You are Pip from the forge.

182
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,400
Yes, Madam.

183
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,600
I am not Madam. I am not married.

184
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,800
You'll call me Miss Havisham.

185
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,960
Sorry, Miss.

186
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,880
Are your feet not cold, Miss?

187
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,840
All of me is cold.

188
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,120
Come.

189
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,680
Look closer if you wish.

190
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,760
My brother's collection.

191
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,360
He went to the furthest
reaches of the earth in his quest

192
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,840
for the purest specimen of beauty.

193
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,400
And when he found it,
he stuck a pin through its heart.

194
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,440
He's dead now.

195
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,520
Cholera. In the tropics.

196
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,880
Struck down in his relentless
pursuit of beauty.

197
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,640
Perhaps it was beauty's revenge,

198
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,040
to stop his heart when he had stopped
so many others.

199
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,400
Do you think beauty
is a destroyer of men, Pip?

200
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,680
I can't be sure, Miss.

201
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,640
We must hope so.

202
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,760
Mustn't we, Estella?

203
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,640
Yes, Mother.

204
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,080
Estella is my adopted daughter.

205
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,800
Estella, this is Pip from the forge.

206
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,200
Play.

207
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,680
Do you not play cards, Pip?

208
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,120
No, Miss.

209
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,080
You will learn.

210
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,480
Your people,

211
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,440
what do they think of you coming
here? They like it, Miss.

212
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,520
Tell me,
what do you hope to be in the future?

213
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,160
I want to be a blacksmith, Miss.
Like Joe.

214
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,880
You sound awfully certain.

215
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
Yes, Miss.

216
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,520
It is wise not to plan the years
ahead too completely.

217
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,640
Everything that was certain
can change in a heartbeat.

218
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,760
I am told you are an orphan.

219
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,000
I am, Miss.

220
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,720
So am I.

221
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,440
So is Estella.

222
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,360
Are there sisters and brothers?

223
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
There's my sister what I live with.

224
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,600
With whom I live. No-one else?

225
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,080
There was five others, Miss.

226
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,680
So they are all dead?

227
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,680
Have you never
wonder why you survived, Pip?

228
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,040
Why you were chosen to live?

229
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,400
I do, Miss.

230
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,800
Perhaps you were
meant for something special.

231
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,480
Perhaps it is intended that you,

232
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,760
like Estella,

233
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,360
will be different

234
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,400
and extraordinary.

235
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,400
That is all for now.
Come again next week to play.
SHE RINGS BELL

236
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,120
Hannah will show you out.

237
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,960
Play.

238
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
Practise on him.

239
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,800
Adopted daughter?

240
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,240
Did you know about this, Uncle?

241
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,720
A grocer must always be discreet.

242
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,520
She wants him to keep company with
her adopted daughter. As equals.

243
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,480
Well, think what this means,
Uncle! As equals!

244
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,000
Don't go filling the boy's head
with no nonsense, Missus.

245
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,320
Did she say anything else about you,
your future?

246
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,400
Pip has a future, he's to be a smith.

247
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,680
Ain't you, Pip?

248
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,240
Oh, cos us is rollin' in coin
for his apprenticeship,

249
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,400
ain't we, Joe Gargery?

250
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,440
Us'll find it.

251
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,120
A smith, indeed.

252
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,560
A boy from the marshes don't keep
company with a rich lady's daughter,

253
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,200
as equals, and then go back to being
a smith!

254
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,960
She must have said something!
Missus!

255
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,800
She said, maybe I was meant
for something special and different!

256
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,960
Special and different.

257
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,480
I always knew I was due more.

258
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,680
Gin. To celebrate.

259
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,200
And get your boots
out of my parlour, Joe Gargery!

260
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,160
We are associating
with the quality now!

261
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,040
I heard all the clocks
is stopped in that house

262
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,240
and she goes around
in only her petticoats

263
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,720
and she don't wear no boots
and she don't brush her hair.

264
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,840
Is that true?

265
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,200
Ain't your place
to ask questions.

266
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,560
You're not special yet.

267
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,080
You don't want to go again,
you don't have to go.

268
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,960
Missus will rampage
like the wrath of God Almighty

269
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,120
but I shall shoulder that.
You just say.

270
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,880
No, I... I want to go.

271
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,760
This adopted daughter.

272
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,240
What's she like, then?

273
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,640
Quiet.

274
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,560
Well. Don't seem like much of a life,
all shut up with no other young 'uns.

275
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,120
Lonely sort of life, I'd say.
So you be friendly.

276
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,280
D'you know any card games, Joe?
Ooh, I know a few.

277
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,240
You's in charge of the eelin' today.

278
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,640
You'll be coming here regular, then.

279
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,080
You say anything about my lady
in that village, you'll answer to me.

280
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,880
Ain't no-one's business.

281
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,200
That's right.
No-one's business but ours.

282
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,560
Wait here.

283
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm sorry, Miss. The door was open.

284
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,600
You are curious.

285
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,560
What do you think it is?

286
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,200
It... It looks like a wedding cake,
Miss.

287
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,280
It is the ghost of a wedding cake.

288
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,520
And I am the ghost of a bride.

289
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,800
Time stands still,
and yet everything turns to dust.

290
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,240
Estella is waiting for you.

291
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,640
Jack trumps yours.

292
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
He calls knaves jacks.

293
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,200
He can call them what he pleases.
He's winning.

294
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,760
Well done, Pip.

295
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,320
Estella, you must concentrate,

296
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,040
if you do not want your opponent
to take advantage.

297
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,960
That will be all for this week.

298
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,440
Estella will see you out.

299
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Love her, Pip.

300
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,160
For me. Love her.

301
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,960
Why did you keep smiling at me?

302
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,160
To be friendly.

303
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,560
Do you think I'm pretty, Pip?

304
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,520
Do you?

305
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,080
Yes. Do you want to kiss me?

306
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,680
What's that smell? What smell?

307
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,560
Dirt. And sweat.

308
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,960
It's the forge. It's you.

309
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,080
Why would I want to be friends with
you? Your clothes don't fit.

310
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,440
I grew.

311
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,160
They're dirty. Your boots are dirty.

312
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,480
You're dirty.

313
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,840
You don't speak correctly. I can
hardly understand what you say.

314
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,240
Why would I want to be
friends with you?

315
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,120
I thought you might be lonely.

316
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,720
Ah!

317
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Smile now.

318
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,800
Go on, smile.

319
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,240
You're crying. I ain't crying.

320
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,320
Ain't? It's, "I am not crying".

321
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,680
But you are. I made you cry.

322
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,160
And I can make you cry
whenever I like.

323
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,160
You ain't ever going
to make me cry.

324
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,400
Do you not have books
in your house, Pip?

325
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,360
No, Miss.

326
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,160
None at all?

327
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,200
How very strange.

328
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,000
Still, I suppose your people
don't have time

329
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,200
for the wonders of the world.

330
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,920
Picking up some proper manners.

331
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Don't know who I've got sittin'
in front of me sometimes.

332
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,280
Do you still wish to be a blacksmith?

333
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,560
I understand.

334
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,320
Your eyes have been opened

335
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,760
and now you cannot close them.

336
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,240
Pip.

337
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,920
She grows prettier every day,
does she not?

338
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,000
I was a beauty once.

339
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
Am I beautiful still?

340
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Yes, Miss.

341
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,840
Borrow the atlas, Pip.

342
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,120
And imagine what a world is out
there for someone different

343
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,520
and extraordinary.

344
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,320
My fingers slipped.

345
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,200
You think you're something, you.
But you ain't.

346
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,520
Me and Joe don't need people who
thinks they's something in our forge.

347
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,880
What are you doing up there, Orlick?

348
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,200
Pip is studying to be raised up.
Get back down here

349
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,160
and do what you're paid to.

350
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,480
Why's it me telling him this?
It's always got to be me.

351
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,480
This is ridiculous.

352
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,280
We have come considerable distance at
great inconvenience.

353
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm sorry, Sir, but you have to
wait.

354
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,880
This is making me bilious.
I need my tincture.

355
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,240
Up the stairs. Straight ahead.
Who the hell is that?

356
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,360
Oh, Mr. Pocket, you are not yourself!
Can you blame me?

357
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,800
Forced to wait like a common
tradesman

358
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,240
while some country urchin
is allowed to roam at will.

359
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
It's insult enough that the girl has
free rein

360
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,280
when nobody knows who she is.
Well, Jaggers?

361
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,880
She declines.

362
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,960
But she'll see that boy
with his boots!

363
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,000
This is preposterous!

364
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,880
I don't believe you argued for us,
Jaggers.

365
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,760
I don't believe you are for us
at all.

366
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,160
You are not my clients.

367
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,960
I am for my clients.

368
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,360
Pip. Estella.

369
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Ain't you well, Miss?

370
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
Are The Pockets still here?

371
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,240
There's some people.

372
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,280
If they're the Pockets then yes,
they're still here.

373
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,200
My family.

374
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,280
Every year on this day,
they come to gloat.

375
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,360
Trumpeting their love and concern.

376
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,600
But I am just carrion to them.

377
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,760
They are crows,

378
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,400
gathered round my corpse,

379
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,720
waiting to feast on me.

380
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,680
But you're not dead, Miss.

381
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Am I not?

382
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,400
Not today.

383
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,520
I should have sent word.

384
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,880
I cannot do this today.

385
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,520
I cannot,
I cannot, not today!

386
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,040
Pip, you will have to leave.

387
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,240
Yes, Miss.

388
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,760
I want them to go!

389
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,760
I want to go downstairs, to my room
and I cannot while they are here.

390
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,480
When will they go?

391
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,640
Pip, you must leave.

392
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,840
Next week,
I shall be quite recovered.

393
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,480
I shall be quite recovered next week.

394
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,280
What are you doing?

395
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
Ain't your business.

396
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,640
Looking for something to steal,
no doubt.

397
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,920
Explain yourself.
Don't poke me with that.

398
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,680
I am a gentleman.

399
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,520
I can do as I please.

400
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,920
And you, you can't.

401
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,200
So I will poke you with this.

402
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,720
And you will just have to take it.

403
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,120
Herbert? Herbert! We're leaving!

404
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,080
What in damnation have you done?

405
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
I fell.

406
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Useless!

407
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,400
You hit him!

408
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,040
I'll get in trouble.

409
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,080
No, you won't. He's not going
to admit that you hit him!

410
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,960
There's blood! It's on your hand.

411
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,440
Why are you so happy?

412
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,960
You made something happen!

413
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,920
It's addressed to you.

414
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,560
Let Uncle Pumblechook read it.

415
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,360
He has the better voice
for such writing.

416
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,920
Dear Mr. Gargery,

417
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
I would be grateful if yourself
and Pip

418
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,040
could attend me
in Satis House this Sunday.

419
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,920
I wish to discuss the matter
of Pip's future.

420
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,120
Sincerely yours.

421
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,720
Oh, this is it.

422
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,000
The reward.

423
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,320
I told you, Mr. Gargery,
didn't I tell you?

424
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,240
We are all going to be raised up!

425
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,760
I... I'm proud of you... Proud.

426
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,920
Er, get those things away from here,

427
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,120
I don't want 'em dripping on my
step!

428
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,320
Didn't bring 'em for you,
brought 'em for Joe.

429
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,920
Well, he don't want 'em either.

430
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,920
From now on, we're going to be
having the best cuts.

431
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,440
Good beef and pork. We won't be
wanting your snared coneys.

432
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,240
And you go your ways too. It's bad
enough I've got to look at your face
the whole week

433
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,520
without you lurking today
when we're celebratin'.

434
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,680
Get gone!

435
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,840
You think you're something,
don't you, Missus?

436
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,520
Flapping your mouth.

437
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,720
If us was Joe, us'd put our hand
across you long time back.

438
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,400
When Mr. Gargery gets back,
I shall tell him what you said.

439
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,480
He gonna send you packing.
Joe'd never get rid of me.

440
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,360
Who d'you think's got his ear? You?

441
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,440
Or his wife?

442
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,520
You're done. Finished.

443
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,880
Mr. Gargery. Pip.

444
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,040
Estella is indisposed.

445
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,760
Please sit down.

446
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,520
Mr. Gargery, you
and Mrs. Gargery have been

447
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,280
so generous allowing Pip
to come here.

448
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,080
And Pip has been so kind
and attentive.

449
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,880
He's an extraordinary young man.

450
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,640
I think so, Miss 'avisham.

451
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,040
There has been no mention
of payment for his time here,

452
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,280
but I would like to make a gift.

453
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,080
A significant gift.

454
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,200
I've spent time thinking of

455
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,800
what I could do to ensure Pip's
future.

456
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,560
And I know what would make him
happy.

457
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,360
I am going to pay for his
apprenticeship to you, Mr. Gargery.

458
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,640
That's most...

459
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,240
most, most kind of you,
Miss 'avisham.

460
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,120
On his very first day,

461
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Pip told me he wanted to be a
blacksmith, like you.

462
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,800
Is that not right, Pip?

463
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,680
I have the papers prepared.

464
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,600
I believe Pip will be bound to
you for seven years?

465
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,840
He will, Miss 'avisham.

466
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,000
If all goes well and he works 'ard
but I know Pip

467
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,360
and ain't a boy works harder.

468
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,080
It's just you to sign now, Pip.

469
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,400
Goodbye, Mr. Gargery.

470
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,400
Goodbye, Pip.

471
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,760
You need not trouble yourself
to come here again.

472
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,960
You have not learned to control
your passions.

473
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,960
You are too unruly.

474
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,880
Has this taught you nothing?

475
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,360
We will begin again.

476
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,520
And this time, you will learn.

477
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,560
What is beauty? A destroyer.

478
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,120
What is happiness? Deception.

479
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,640
What is love? Death.

480
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,400
I know you wanted somethin' else.

481
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,000
I know you got sweet on the girl.

482
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,640
I know it.

483
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,120
But it could never happen, Pip.

484
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,040
This is best.

485
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,440
This is right. Might not
feel like it now, but it is.

486
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,920
And now I've to tell Missus

487
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,520
and she'll most likely
smash all the china.

488
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,640
Missus!

489
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,920
Missus, my dear!

490
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,920
Get the doctor.

491
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,280
Who'd do such a thing, Joe?

492
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,960
And on a Sunday too?

493
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,360
Thieves looking
for something to steal.

494
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,680
Missus can't tell
and never will now, doctor says.

495
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,520
Knew I should never have
left her alone.

496
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,400
Here. Here.

497
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,320
That's my job.
That's what I'm here for.

498
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,760
Go on to the Missus,

499
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,120
let old Orlick look after the forge.

500
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,040
It goes Joe. It goes me.

501
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,400
It goes you.

502
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,720
That's how it goes
in this 'ere forge.

503
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,760
Joe. Me. You.

504
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,400
Don't get in my way.

505
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,320
"My dear Pip.
I hope this letter finds you well.

506
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,320
"I wonder if I might prevail upon you
to visit me."

507
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,120
You have grown, Pip. Thank you, Miss.

508
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,800
How does your apprenticeship
progress?

509
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,440
It progresses very well, Miss.

510
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,160
Estella was very curious to see you
again after so long.

511
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,280
Come down, Estella.

512
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,120
Estella leaves for Paris soon.

513
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,480
Paris?

514
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,920
She requires some finishing touches.

515
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,680
There is an establishment that will
hone her accomplishments.

516
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,440
Make her ready.

517
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,280
When are you comin' back?

518
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,680
I will not live here again.

519
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,960
She will go to London,

520
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,320
a lady, and marry a gentleman.

521
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,640
I believe she will make a very good
match.

522
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,360
She will have her pick.

523
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,160
Do you not think, Pip, as I do,

524
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,200
that Estella is beautiful?

525
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,480
Yes.

526
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,600
Yes.

527
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,440
How very kind of you to come.

528
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,040
I wish you good fortune.

529
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,360
My jewel,

530
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,080
my prize.

531
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,640
Pip.

532
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,560
Why did you come back?

533
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,840
She asked me.
Don't come again.

534
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,120
Even if she begs.

535
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,560
Forget about this house and everyone
in it. Why?

536
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,880
You look well, Pip.

537
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,240
Estella.

538
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Orlick, I can't pay you.

539
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,840
I'm havin' to pay the doctor
for Missus and her medicines.

540
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,040
Pip's learned enough now.

541
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,560
I'm sorry.

542
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,360
I was 'ere before him.

543
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,800
I been with you since I was a young
'un! I know...

544
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,200
If things were different,
you'd be stayin'.
But things ain't different.

545
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,480
You send anyone to me
and I'll tell 'em how good you are.

546
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
I swear to that.

547
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,440
Whoa, there.

548
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,960
Mr. Pirrip?

549
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,320
Known as Pip?

550
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,160
My name is Jaggers.
Shall we go inside?

551
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,160
What's he done, then?

552
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,160
I am here with
an instruction from a client.

553
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,760
And my instruction is to communicate

554
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,920
to Mr. Pirrip that he has a
benefactor.

555
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,800
And this benefactor has bestowed
upon you a handsome property.

556
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,200
What?

557
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,120
Money, Joe. Isn't that right? Money?

558
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,040
A fortune.

559
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,720
Pip 'as a fortune? From who?

560
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,520
The owner of this handsome property
also desires that Mr. Pirrip

561
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,720
be immediately removed
from his present sphere of life,

562
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,000
from his present place
and go to London.

563
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,720
Where he is to be instructed
in the ways and manners of society,

564
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,400
where he is to live the life
of a gentleman,

565
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,640
where, in short,

566
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,560
he is to live as a young fellow
of great expectations.

567
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,200
Pip has to leave here?

568
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,440
Leave his home?

569
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,440
There are provisos.

570
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,840
You are to be
known and addressed by all as Pip.

571
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,720
If you have any objections to that,
speak now.

572
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,520
No. None.

573
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,480
Wait, stop. Who? Who done this?

574
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,680
You must never enquire after
the identity of your benefactor.

575
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,720
You are prohibited from making any
supposition or wild surmise.

576
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,440
When you reach your majority,
the identity will be revealed.

577
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,200
Until then, you are bound by law to
the proviso.

578
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,000
Do you understand? Yes.

579
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,520
This is for immediate expenses.

580
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,440
Travel.

581
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,960
And appropriate attire.

582
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,160
When you arrive in London,
come directly to me.

583
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,760
I shall write to Estella.

584
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,720
She will be most intrigued.

585
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,080
And perhaps, in London, me and
'er will meet again.

586
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,800
Pip, if you are to be a gentleman,
you must modulate your speech.

587
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,760
I'll work on that, Miss.

588
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,040
And you must avail
yourself of a proper London tailor.

589
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,560
I will, Miss.

590
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,320
I'm a quick learner.
I won't let you down.

591
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,120
Thank you, Miss Havisham.

592
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,720
Good luck, Pip.

593
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,920
And to think I gave you your first
opportunity, Mr. Pip!

594
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,520
Be happy, Joe.

595
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,640
She means me for Estella!

596
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,800
Raised up, niece.

597
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,840
As we said.

598
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,760
Too late for you.

599
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,600
Not too late for me.

600
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,320
Don't forget about us, Pip!

601
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,800
So, the young gentleman of
expectations arrives in London.

602
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,400
Not quite the finished articles,
but you will be.

603
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,000
You are very late, Mr. Drummle!

604
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,800
Sir. You've no call to lay 'ands
on me.

605
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,440
Who's there?

606
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,880
Breeding, bloodlines
and proven provenance.

607
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,800
