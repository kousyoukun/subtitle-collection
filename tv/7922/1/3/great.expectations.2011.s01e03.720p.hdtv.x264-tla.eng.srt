1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,380
'I am in love with Estella.'

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,359
We were told she was the orphaned
child of friends but no friends

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,159
anyone had ever heard of.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,319
Who are you? I am a gentleman.
But you're not.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,399
Any more than she is a lady.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,919
Mrs!

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,039
Your room's the same from when you
left. I put sheets on the bed.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,279
No, Joe, I can't stay.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,199
Compeyson was a con-man, Pip.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,119
On the day of the wedding,

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,359
he sent her a note and was never
seen again.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,999
You have bills at your club.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,239
They're not unpaid, they're just
not paid yet. But they will be.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Who are you? Abel Magwitch.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,840
It's me that is your benefactor.
You're my gentleman, Pip.

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,720
Beautiful, ain't it?

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,080
Pick it up, it's yours.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,559
Feel it. Smell it.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,360
That'll set you up for life, boy.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,599
I don't understand.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,319
What's to understand?

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,279
You've come of age
and here's what you were promised,

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,839
what you've been waiting on!

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,919
It ain't complicated!

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,080
How did you find me?

27
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,639
You didn't take no finding.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,919
I've had my eyes on you
the whole while.

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,159
Jaggers sent back his reports.

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,959
This can't be true, this can't...
It can't be you.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,480
I never forgot you, Pip.

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,959
You been in there since
that first day. I never forgot you.

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,999
It's my friend Herbert! Please!

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,639
You trust 'im?

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,600
With my life! Please!
I'm begging you.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,199
You Pip's friend. Herbert Pocket.
Delighted to meet you.

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,759
Are you going to be my friend,
Herbert Pocket?

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,880
Do you know how to keep that shut?
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
Good man.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,479
Now you take that down to the bank
tomorrow.

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,160
We don't want no criminals thieving
it off you, do we?

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,919
I ain't putting you out?

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,079
No, no. Not at all.
I'm a married man now.

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,560
I don't live here any more.

45
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:13,279
What happened before.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,159
It won't happen again.
I apologise for that.

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,079
Mr Magwitch,
forgive my impertinence but

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,640
how long do you intend to
stay in London?

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,840
I've come home for good.

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,199
You must be exhausted. Sleep well.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,279
Pip, we have a very serious problem.
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,159
Clara's papa got so drunk

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,999
he forgot we're married
and chased me away with a stick.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,799
Clara said I should come here until
she can talk to him.

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,719
Pip, your benefactor is
a returned lifer.

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,279
We have to consider very
carefully what we do now.

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,239
He is not my benefactor. You said,
it's Miss Havisham.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,159
I presumed and so did you.
We were both wrong. He's lying.

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,519
He knows Jaggers, where you live,
everything about you. Listen.

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,639
Someone has been following me.

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,879
What do you mean, followed?
Someone just behind me, watching.

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,519
It's him. That's how he knows.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,559
He's come back, Pip!
Do you know what the penalty is?

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,639
We cannot discuss this
with anyone else,

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,600
we have to think of what to do.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
It can't be him.

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,200
This is a hoax, I can prove it.
Pip!

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,800
Pippity-Pip.

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,759
What are you doing here?

70
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,839
Deadly mausoleum, this.
Can you smell it?

71
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,879
Rot. Decay.

72
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
People who don't take care for their
property should be shot in my book.

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,599
I said, what are you doing here?
She stands to inherit it.

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
Which makes it mine.

75
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:19,600
Well, I will burn it to the ground.

76
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
What did you say?

77
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,799
A woman's inheritance
belongs to her husband.

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,839
He can do what
he likes with her goods.

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,319
No.

80
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,759
She's telling the old woman now of
my formal intentions. No. No.

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,999
A quick wedding and then
I will remove my wife from London

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,959
and the host of undesirables that
cluster about her.

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,039
No. She'd never wed you.

84
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,839
Wed me? How quaint. Voice really
slipped there, Pippy. Slippy Pippy.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,879
Go on, say something else. Amuse me.

86
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,200
Say something in that real voice
of yours. It's so entertaining.

87
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,800
To the victor the spoils.

88
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,319
Pip, this is private.

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,359
Let him speak, Jaggers.

90
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,679
Don't. Not him. Don't.

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,999
I did warn you.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,599
No, you didn't.
I did. You just weren't listening.

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,519
You're meant to marry me.

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,240
And when was this decided?

95
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,880
Since always! This is what it's been
for, being a gentleman, for you!

96
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,960
Marry me. I love you,
I've always loved you.

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,240
You were meant to.
Everyone's meant to love me.

98
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,920
But I don't love back.
I do not have a heart.

99
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,439
I will write.

100
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,519
And I will answer. As ever.
Goodbye, Pip.

101
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,039
No, I won't let you do it!

102
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,840
You do not have a say in the matter.

103
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:03,480
I don't believe you. You kissed me.

104
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,960
I was practising on you.
As I was from the very beginning.

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,799
Is that not right, Mother?

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,280
You brought him here for me
to practise on?

107
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,800
Remove your hand.
You're staining the silk.

108
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,639
Why do you look away, Mother?

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,360
Is this not your training made
manifest? Does it not please you?

110
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,840
I said, does it not please you!

111
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,040
It pleases me.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
I told you I could make you cry.

113
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,400
If only you had listened.

114
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,280
The agony is exquisite, is it not?

115
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
The broken heart.

116
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,640
You think you will die, but you just
keep living...

117
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,479
day, after day,
after terrible day.

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,319
You have to stop her.
He is cruel and arrogant.

119
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,319
He is perfect.

120
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,240
Hand-picked
for exactly those reasons.

121
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
But she will break him.

122
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,479
He will not have a day's happiness.

123
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
His nights spent weeping.

124
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,440
His world a cold and joyless stone.

125
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,639
Is this your revenge?

126
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,039
You think Bentley Drummle will care
if his wife does not love him?

127
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,159
You know nothing about men,
Miss Havisham.

128
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,759
I know what savages they are.

129
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,079
He will take what he wants
and do as he pleases.

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,120
And Estella has no-one to
protect her.

131
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,760
She will triumph.

132
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,079
Expedite these quickly.

133
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,480
I do not want the wedding
delayed for any reason.

134
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,039
You, marry my prize?

135
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,919
What in heaven's name made you think
she was meant for you?

136
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,359
You did. You let me think
you were my benefactor.

137
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,999
You told me Estella could only
ever marry a gentleman

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,519
and I was made a gentleman.

139
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,239
You knew I thought it was you.

140
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,960
You are not a gentleman.
You are not even a blacksmith.

141
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,439
You did not finish
your apprenticeship.

142
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,560
You are merely
the boy from the forge.

143
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,600
I gather you have had
communication from New South Wales?

144
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,280
I got the news in person.

145
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,680
He's in London?

146
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:36,719
What do I do?

147
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,479
I cannot advise you on this.

148
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,440
It must be kept away from me.
Right away.

149
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,879
I've been waiting for you. I have to
take you somewhere. Where?

150
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,079
What are we doing here?

151
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,400
Herbert has arranged a hiding place.
For me? From Magwitch?

152
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,879
No. A hiding place for him.
He has your portable property.

153
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,119
As it stands, the property is
a little too portable for my liking.

154
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,639
If he is caught with it, the Crown
will confiscate every last penny.

155
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,159
That makes me quite dyspeptic, but
he will only put it into your hand.

156
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,119
Caught?
Events have moved very fast.

157
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,279
I heard of a return this morning.

158
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,120
All of Newgate was
bubbling with it.

159
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,359
There are eyes watching the ports
for those such as him.

160
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,039
Now a reward has been offered, the
watching eyes will be ever sharper.

161
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,599
We must get him
safely from the country.

162
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,079
He got himself here, he can get out
again. He doesn't need my help.

163
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,039
He is a lifer who has
defied the law.

164
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,919
There will be no plea,
no mitigation, not even a hearing.

165
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
He will hang.

166
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,959
This is going to take a little time
and there are no guarantees

167
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,279
but we will do all
we can to get you out.

168
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,759
I'll start my own Newgate rumours
that you've been seen in Southampton

169
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,239
which may draw the soldiers
and other interested parties away.

170
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,279
Herbert is going to use his contacts

171
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,079
to find a suitable ship
with an amenable captain.

172
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,839
Who would put a price on my head
after all these years?

173
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,359
Who would care?

174
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
A man named Denby.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,959
I don't know no Denby

176
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,359
and why would
he put a reward on my head?

177
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,279
We know a Mr Denby. He's a member
of our club, Finches.

178
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,199
I don't recall him.
You do. He runs all the card games.

179
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,359
He has a scar just...
under his eye.

180
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,320
Compeyson.

181
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,359
Compeyson. If you go after him,
you will be caught.

182
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,559
You cannot risk it,
everything you hoped for

183
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,160
will be gone. Stop talking,
Mr Wemmick.

184
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,599
What price did he put on me?

185
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,599
A thousand pounds. I imagine
he always anticipated this day.

186
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,680
He flatters himself if he thinks
I've come all this way for him.

187
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,159
If I go, does he still get
everything I hoped for?

188
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,999
He does.

189
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,879
No trouble to him, no danger.
Not if we're circumspect, no.

190
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,399
All right.

191
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,919
You make your plans.

192
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,039
I'll start looking straightaway.

193
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,479
I must emphasise, Mr Magwitch, that
you remain out of sight and silent

194
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,559
until you're away and clear ...

195
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,679
the shadow of the noose
hangs heavy over you.

196
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,320
Has done since I was born,
Mr Wemmick.

197
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,359
This is not how I wanted it, Pip.

198
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,039
You've got to believe me,

199
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,719
this is not how I planned it.

200
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,560
You should have
stayed in New South Wales.

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
Pip.

202
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,719
A moment, please, Herbert.

203
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,759
You must accept the property.
I don't want anything from him.

204
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,159
Might I remind you,
you still owe Clarrikers

205
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,679
a substantial sum for Herbert's
partnership?

206
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,960
Yes, I'll find it,
but I'm not taking his money.

207
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,799
Can that really be
the same Compeyson,

208
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,639
the man who ruined Miss Havisham?

209
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,159
Why would he change his name
if he were not a villain?

210
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,319
What could there be between them?

211
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,599
Who knows?

212
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,079
Money. Some criminal enterprise
gone sour.

213
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,159
Perhaps Magwitch has changed.

214
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,359
I've spent more time with him
than you have.

215
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,079
All his concern was for you,
not for his own safety.

216
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,119
People do not just change!
We both did.

217
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,119
And for what?
What did I do all that for?

218
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
It has all been for nothing.

219
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,159
Estella is marrying Bentley Drummle.

220
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,200
Dear God.

221
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,879
I'm very sorry about Estella.

222
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,679
You travelled some distance to
discover that you were not wanted.

223
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,959
Magwitch came from the end
of the world to find the same.

224
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,959
We cannot turn our backs on him now.

225
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,319
We will see this through together
but see it through, we must.

226
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,239
Pip, every scoundrel in London
will be chasing that reward.

227
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,959
Men will turn into wolves

228
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,799
and tear each other to
shreds for a glass of gin.

229
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,480
What will they do
for a thousand pounds?

230
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,560
Sir.

231
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,760
Sir, sir... No, really.

232
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,320
Come back!

233
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,080
Go over here.

234
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
It's Pip.

235
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,000
I was hasty.

236
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,400
Compeyson was the second
man on the marshes.

237
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,440
I tried killing him that night.
I should have tried harder. Why?

238
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,199
He owes me.

239
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,559
Were you partners?

240
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,160
What are you asking for?
I need to know.

241
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,959
Once.

242
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,999
And this once, did you hear
of a Miss Havisham of Satis House?

243
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,880
Should I?

244
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,799
That turns your guts, don't it?

245
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,159
You think I murdered for that?
I've taken lives for less.

246
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,999
I don't know what you did to get it.
No, you don't.

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,119
Why me? Why do this for me?
Because I stole you a file?

248
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,880
I only did that
because I was scared.

249
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,919
You said you'd cut my throat.
I know what I said.

250
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,360
And it weren't the file,
it was the pie.

251
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,360
I'd forgotten about the pie.

252
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,280
The file you took
because you was scared, but...

253
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,240
that pie...

254
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,599
that was out of goodness.

255
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,639
Did you think that I'd be grateful?

256
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,399
You take me away from my home,
I turn my back on my family

257
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,319
for some mystery benefactor
and it turns out to be you.

258
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,639
I don't recall stipulatin'
you turn your back on your own.

259
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,840
If you did, it's down to you,
don't bring this to my door!

260
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,360
You've made a mess of it, ain't you?

261
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,480
Yes. Yeah.

262
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,600
Well, that makes two of us.

263
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
So here we are with a mess.

264
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,239
No. I can't. No, I don't want to.
I can't.

265
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,120
Compose yourself, my dear.

266
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,840
There.

267
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,360
Aren't you exquisite?

268
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,039
Other men take their work
home with them,

269
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,799
but Chambers will never get
a foot in the door at Walworth.

270
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,600
It'll be over by now.

271
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,919
Maybe Mr Jaggers
raised an objection.

272
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,639
You're asked, aren't you, if anybody
has any objection, to speak?

273
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,279
Maybe Jaggers spoke.

274
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,839
He is Miss Havisham's proxy.

275
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,120
He will abide by her wishes.

276
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,560
There is some brandy somewhere.

277
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,239
I told you not to go.
You should not have been there!

278
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,359
But you can't tell me what to do
and where to go!

279
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,199
Look, you ain't the master of me!
Molly...

280
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,559
You said she'd be taken care of.

281
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,120
You made promises.

282
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,160
It's beyond my control.

283
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,560
They've been sent back, Miss.

284
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,679
Estella!

285
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,920
Lazy, ignorant...

286
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,760
The truth is, there's not one ship
going out whose captain I trust.

287
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,480
We cannot just give up.

288
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,079
I'm not giving up.

289
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,240
I just don't know if I'm going to
find a ship before I go to Cairo.

290
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,680
I wish I had better news.

291
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,279
I did say there were no guarantees.

292
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,079
I have absolute faith in Herbert.

293
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,679
I'm sure that will sustain him
when Clarrikers let him go.

294
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,079
They demand the full sum. You have
to accept your portable property.

295
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,039
I can't.

296
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,519
Magwitch wants me to be a son
to him. I can't be that.

297
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,399
If I take his money,
then I'm deceiving him.

298
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,119
I'll sell all this.

299
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,240
You cannot sell what you do not own.

300
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,600
The full sum for Clarrikers...

301
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,840
or Herbert loses everything.

302
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,519
There's a gentleman here to see you,
sir. Most urgent.

303
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,880
Excuse me.

304
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,360
Where is he?

305
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,079
Who are you?

306
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,359
It's a sharp night tonight,
even for us what's used to it.

307
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,400
How keen it must seem for them
returned from hotter climes.

308
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,839
Where is he?

309
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,399
Us don't know that yet.

310
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,919
Then what good are you?

311
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,799
Us knows where he's been.

312
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,600
Us knows who to watch to get to him.

313
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:46,880
Who?

314
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,400
And how rich are you goin'
to make Old Orlick, then?

315
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,759
You find what I'm looking for

316
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,919
and you'll have
beef and brandy every day

317
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,480
and a different whore every night.

318
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,760
Miss Havisham?

319
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,839
What are you doing here?

320
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,679
You are not invited.

321
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,639
Where is Hannah?

322
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,399
I sent her away.

323
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,919
You cannot live here alone.

324
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,159
I am the lady of the house.
I shall do as I please.

325
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,920
I will have you removed.

326
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,319
What do you want?

327
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,679
I have to ask you for something.

328
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,799
I wish I could ask anyone else,
but I can't.

329
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,119
You want money.

330
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,359
It is not for me.

331
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,439
Why should I give you money?
You have done very well out of me.

332
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,359
You and Estella both
have done very well,

333
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,839
and I have suffered.

334
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,600
Have you heard from Estella?

335
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,480
She left me.

336
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,239
I took her in as an orphan,

337
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,559
I gave her everything,

338
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,119
and this is how she repays me,

339
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,559
by leaving me.

340
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,839
You have had a wasted journey.
You will get nothing from me.

341
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,919
I could have made her so happy.
We were meant for each other.

342
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,080
This house could have been full of
children. You could have been happy.

343
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,719
No.

344
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,880
Don't touch me.

345
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,440
Remember your place.

346
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,680
I want you to go.

347
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,880
If I give you money, will you leave?

348
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,919
Yes. If that's what you want.

349
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,160
Very well.

350
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,280
What is the required amount?

351
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,560
£350, made payable to Mr Clarriker.

352
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
Do you not want to know
what it is for?

353
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,680
Thank you, Miss Havisham.

354
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,640
I have hurt you.

355
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,480
I wanted to hurt you.

356
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,960
I wanted to hurt everybody.

357
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
You forgive me?

358
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,840
Forgive me.

359
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,240
I forgive you, Miss Havisham.

360
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,440
Come here.

361
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,400
What?

362
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,239
I wish you had not come back
because of me.

363
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,399
I wish you had your own family,
your own child to give all this to

364
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,720
rather than being in such danger
from Compeyson, all because of me.

365
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,759
Do you know how he got this?

366
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,960
Did you give it to him?

367
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,160
Not me, no.

368
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,399
My wife did.

369
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,039
Compeyson had a fancy for her.

370
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,079
I was away in the North
so he thought he'd try on his luck.

371
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,759
She marked him for his troubles.

372
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,199
He had her taken
for attempted murder.

373
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,359
I come home,

374
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,999
hear my wife's in Newgate...

375
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,679
my child left alone without
a mother's protection, dead of fever,

376
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:50,119
dead and gone, buried in a common pit
without a prayer said.

377
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,639
I try to hunt him down...

378
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,160
but he's off...

379
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,879
until...

380
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,840
we get tried for a crime we both did.

381
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,959
I get transportation,
he gets two years' soft time.

382
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,639
They think he's a gentleman

383
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,399
who's made a mistake
with the company he keeps.

384
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,439
I get chained. He don't.

385
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,919
That long march to the Hulks,
he knows I'll do him in.

386
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,359
So he goes over the side
to get away from me,

387
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,839
I go after him to rip his black
heart out through his lyin' mouth.

388
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,120
And that's where you come in, Pip.

389
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,759
Did you think this was just
a felon's dispute?

390
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,119
A little bit of nothing?

391
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,439
Your wife, did she hang?

392
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,800
No, Jaggers was for her.

393
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,519
It was Jaggers who told me
about my family.

394
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,519
Because he saved my wife
from the drop,

395
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,279
I decided
he should have the care of you.

396
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,879
So you see, I did have a child
and then I didn't.

397
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,079
And what's left,
you fill it up with...

398
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,080
drinkin', fightin' and
bein' worse than you was before.

399
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,440
And then I filled it up with you.

400
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,759
Sheep.

401
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,039
It's all from sheep.

402
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,520
It's good wool, good meat.

403
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,440
I worked so bloody hard.

404
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,240
I thought if I could do good by you,
I could do good by her.

405
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,480
You had a daughter. She was...

406
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
she was a beautiful little girl.

407
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,799
Her and Molly,

408
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,320
they deserved better than me.

409
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,120
Wait!

410
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,920
Mr Wemmick,
would you close the door?

411
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,439
Estella's father is Abel Magwitch.

412
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,719
You told him his child was dead.

413
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,040
I did what was best.

414
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,439
She had a new name, a new life.
She was settled.

415
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,519
And that is Estella's mother
who you saved from the noose.

416
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,599
Did you take her case
because she was beautiful?

417
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,080
So the inscrutable Jaggers
is a man like any other.

418
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:36,159
And what did you ask for
in lieu of payment?

419
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,319
Because she is not your housekeeper,
is she?

420
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,039
And she owes you her life.

421
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,919
She owes me nothing.

422
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,439
She came of her own free will,
she stays of her own free will.

423
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,959
No wonder you wanted Magwitch
kept away from you.

424
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,639
The fear of being discovered,
that you stole his daughter.

425
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,319
All those secrets laid bare.

426
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,320
You have not seen children so young,
so tiny in court...

427
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,879
they have to be lifted up so the
judge can see them to pass sentence.

428
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,400
Children, imprisoned, transported...

429
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,719
dying on those ships,

430
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,759
or on those streets, or in those
cells or at the end of a rope,

431
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,639
the result is always the same.

432
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,039
Dead before they have a chance
of life.

433
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,679
And here is an innocent child
with a mother in prison

434
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,879
and a father nowhere to be found.
He knew none of it.

435
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,999
She was still alone.

436
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,639
And here is a wealthy client
who asks me to find a girl

437
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,520
she can raise as her own.

438
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,599
Stolen?

439
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,759
Saved.

440
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,519
Saved?

441
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,599
She is married to Bentley Drummle.

442
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,720
Even I cannot look into the future.

443
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,480
What damage would the truth do now?

444
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,720
To everyone?

445
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,840
Some secrets are best left.

446
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Time you went.

447
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,839
Herbert has found a ship that sails
tomorrow night for the Cape.

448
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,238
The Captain can be trusted.

449
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,680
Herbert did him a favour,

450
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:17,719
Captain's happy to repay
it by looking the other way.

451
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,119
You've always known everything,
haven't you?

452
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,159
I'm Mr Jaggers' chief clerk.

453
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,039
Tomorrow night, Pip,

454
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,840
you have to get Magwitch ready.

455
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,839
The Cape.

456
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,880
Yes.

457
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,239
I swore I was done with boats.

458
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,520
At least this time
I won't be chained.

459
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,200
Can I come with you?

460
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,399
I can't go home,
not after the things I've said,

461
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,680
the things I've done.

462
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,160
I have to start again.

463
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,519
D'you get seasick?

464
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,399
I don't know.

465
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,840
Well, if you do,
stand downwind of me.

466
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,159
"My dearest Joe,

467
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,239
"I'm sorry I don't have the courage
to say this to you in person.

468
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,959
"I'm going away.

469
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,840
"Not forever, but for a while.

470
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,839
"I will return a better man

471
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,399
"who can look you in the eye
and beg your pardon"

472
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,319
"for having treated you as no loving
son should ever treat his father."

473
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,160
"Until then,
you will always be in my heart."

474
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,039
I should've drowned you
when you first come to the forge.

475
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,959
Squallin', 'orrible brat you
was. Always in Orlick's way.

476
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,599
Should've drowned
you like a runt puppy.

477
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,879
It was you following me.

478
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,039
Magwitch shall dance for them,
but you're mine.

479
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,920
I shall stove in your skull
like I did your sister's.

480
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,799
You ain't going to be
in Orlick's way no more.

481
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,959
I'll disappear you
piece by piece.

482
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,839
Joe will think you forgot about him
altogether.

483
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,640
But it won't matter
because I'll be there.

484
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,080
This is where you need to get to,
the London Stone.

485
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:10,119
It's the end of the city's
jurisdiction.

486
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,479
Past that, you're a free man,
cannot be touched.

487
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,879
Now, it's a distance,
use the tide and you can make it.

488
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,239
When you get beyond the Stone,
you wait.

489
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,919
At midnight, the Crown Princess
will come through, cut her engines

490
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,679
and drop a ladder starboard.

491
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,880
Then you're away.

492
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,479
At the same time, we'll be
boarding our steamer for Cairo,

493
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,959
but the only thing
we'll be thinking about is you.

494
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,360
Let's go.

495
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,440
I'll never forget
what you've done for us. Never.

496
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,720
Herbert.

497
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,480
What would I have become
if I'd not met you?

498
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,639
The London Stone has a beacon.

499
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,799
You cannot miss it.

500
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,239
Write to us.

501
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,840
I'll be afraid
until I hear all is well.

502
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,360
Go, you need the tide
to help you. Go.

503
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,719
Get away! Get away!

504
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,000
Tie the reins! Tie the reins!

505
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,400
Somebody call for help.

506
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,520
Thank you.

507
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,159
You all right, Pip.

508
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,479
No regrets?

509
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,920
Only one and there's nothing
I can do about it.

510
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,879
It's the London Stone. We're there!

511
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,719
You're a free man, Magwitch.

512
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,679
Yeah.

513
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,840
Pull.

514
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,840
What are you doing?
We're nearly there.

515
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,880
It's moving.

516
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,839
Hard about!

517
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,959
Magwitch, what are you doing?

518
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,399
It's him.

519
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,959
I know it.

520
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,800
Quickly!

521
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,960
You be lucky, Pip.

522
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,440
Magwitch!

523
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,720
Magwitch! Don't move. Don't move!

524
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,599
Get him here! Pull him in!

525
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,319
Get him in!

526
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,199
No! Don't move.

527
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,600
Please.

528
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,800
Stop it, you'll kill him.

529
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,880
No!

530
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,599
Mr Pirrip? Borrit from the Bailiffs.

531
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,680
Come to recoup.

532
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,200
Help yourself.

533
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,680
Move yourself.

534
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,920
In there.

535
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,600
Let him in.

536
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,000
And the rest.

537
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,760
Pip.

538
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,639
'There has to be some leniency
for Magwitch, he's dying.'

539
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,239
They cannot hang a dying man.

540
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,359
It's decided. His sentence is set.

541
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,239
He cannot walk. Is he to be dragged
to the gallows through the crowds?

542
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,519
It's just the way it is, Pip,
it's just the law.

543
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,119
Then the law's a bastard.

544
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,239
The rooms are all cleared.
Present yourself at the bailiff's.

545
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,680
There's still a pound owing.
I don't have it.

546
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,439
Have you got the money?

547
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,399
Is the money safe?

548
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,840
Yes.

549
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,840
Get some horses.
You've got to have horses.

550
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,719
I'll get a coach and four.

551
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,960
High...steppers ... everyone will look.

552
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,439
They're coming for me, ain't they?

553
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,119
They are.

554
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,400
They shan't have me.

555
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,039
Abel, can you hear me?

556
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,000
Look, squeeze my hand
if you can hear me.

557
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,679
Your little girl didn't die.

558
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,159
She's alive.

559
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,119
I know who she is.

560
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,439
She was adopted by a rich lady.

561
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,760
She grew up so beautiful.

562
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,680
But believe me, she lives.

563
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:29,840
And she's loved.

564
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,080
I love her.

565
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,159
I always have and always will.

566
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,919
Look, can you hear me, Abel?

567
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,880
She's so very loved.

568
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,280
Where will you go now?

569
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,759
To hand myself in to the bailiff.

570
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,719
It's been paid.

571
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,039
I wrote to Mr Gargery,
he sent a guinea.

572
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,559
Joe paid it?

573
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,760
There's, uh...

574
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,760
a shilling over.

575
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,759
I wish you good fortune, Pip.

576
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,520
Anything but that, Mr Wemmick.

577
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,199
There's a shilling over.

578
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,199
A guinea, Joe.

579
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,560
It's all you would have had.

580
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,280
I don't deserve it.

581
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,360
I don't deserve you.

582
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,479
There, there.

583
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,199
Best of friends as ever we were.

584
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,719
Whoa!

585
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,719
Pip.

586
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,119
Trainee Commissioner for Oaths.

587
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,039
Ink and dust.

588
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,359
Your poor sister
would have wept at the waste.

589
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,119
People will always need the law.

590
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,759
But as one family star falls,

591
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,039
another is in the ascendant.

592
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,279
Satis House has renewed
its weekly order.

593
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,359
Mrs Drummle has come back.

594
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,199
And come back a widow.

595
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,839
She inherits two fortunes!

596
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,559
Pumblechook is a grocer of quality
to the quality once more!

597
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,959
Walk on, Jen.

598
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,480
Good girl!

599
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,000
That's it. Good girl, good girl.

600
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,639
