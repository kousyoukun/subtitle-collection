1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Do you not want it?

2
00:00:03,081 --> 00:00:05,399
Varmint nonpareil, as they say.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,199
Bound for the end of the world now.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,039
Perhaps you, like Estella,
will be extraordinary.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,119
Why would I want to be
friends with YOU?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,520
Thought you might be lonely.

7
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,560
Missus!

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,839
Do you not think, Pip,
that Estella is beautiful?

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,080
Pip has a fortune.

10
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,039
The owner of this handsome property
also desires

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,599
that Mr Pirrip
immediately go to London,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,000
where he is to live as a young
fellow of great expectations.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,280
London and Inns of Court!

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
Thank you. Sir.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,559
Where's Mr Jaggers' office?

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,279
I'm first. I'm first! I've been
waiting longer than anyone!

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm first! Amelia, I have told you,
over and over,

19
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,959
I know enough of your husband
to keep him from the drop.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,359
I do not want to know the truth,
the law does not require it!

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,879
And you, sir, must pay Wemmick
the full cost,

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,799
only then can we discuss the
mitigation of your circumstances.

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
I can pay you double!

24
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,599
If you'll be for my brother,
I can pay you double!

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
It is too late.

26
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:29,159
I am already on
the other side of the floor.

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,239
You are against him?

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,919
Follow.

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,519
Have mercy! Mr Jaggers! Mr Jaggers!

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,200
CROWD CLAMOURS

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
Follow.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,319
So the young gentleman
of expectations arrives in London.

33
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,759
Every Friday,
you and other young men of means

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,759
for whose families
I perform the function of guardian,

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,879
will come here to receive
your allowance for that week.

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
Are you listening?

37
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,200
Yes, Mr Jaggers.

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,678
This will continue
until you come of age

39
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,000
and receive your fortune,

40
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,479
which you may carefully preserve
for posterity

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,039
or squander
inside a calendar month.

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,319
At that point,
you may do as you will,

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,359
because you are no longer
under my charge.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,639
Until then, you do...

45
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
as I say.

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,359
What's for lunch?

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,920
A kidney pie, Mr Jaggers.
The gravy is most fragrant.

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,199
Rooms have been arranged for you
at Barnard's Inn,

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,559
where you are to share
with young Mr Pocket.

50
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,039
Herbert Pocket?

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,159
Mr Pocket has been engaged to help
habituate you to your new life.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,679
This can't be right.

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Herbert's related to Miss Havisham
and she's...

54
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,160
The proviso, Pip.

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,039
You do not discuss
or speculate as to the identity

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,399
of your benefactor until they
themselves reveal their identity

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,559
at your majority or very soon after.

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,639
I know but...

59
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,520
But nothing!

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,079
Young Mr Pocket has been
cut off from his family.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,039
He is Mr Wemmick's suggestion.
If it proves unsatisfactory,

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,680
we will endeavour to find
someone more suitable.

63
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,159
Mr Wemmick will give you the first
instalment of your allowance.

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,080
Be prudent with it.
Do NOT fall into debt.

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
HE GARGLES

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,680
Questions?

67
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,879
I wondered if Miss Havisham
had told you

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,800
when Estella might be comin'
to London?

69
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,439
And why would I be furnished

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,879
with the details of
that young lady's itinerary?

71
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,319
I just thought that...
Do not think, Pip.

72
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,160
It never leads to anywhere edifying.

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
Back to the Bailey!

74
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,879
DOOR CLOSES

75
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
What's that head, Mr Wemmick?

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,639
One lost to the drop.

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,520
The cast taken
when he was fresh down.

78
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
Why does Mr Jaggers keep it?

79
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,359
It was the man's request.

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,039
He ended up in the common pit.

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,999
No marker, no stone
to say he'd ever existed.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,759
And he was one of the best at
his trade until the law did for him.

83
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,399
He wanted to be remembered.
Jaggers honoured his final wish.

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,640
It's horrible. It is his sentinel.

85
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,680
Memento mori.

86
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,120
Sign here, please.

87
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Mike?

88
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Show Mr Pip the way to Barnard's Inn
and introduce him to the watchman.

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,840
It's not Mr Pip, it's just Pip.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,559
It's in the proviso.

91
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,199
Just Pip.

92
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
Just Pip.

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,599
New one for you.

94
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,920
Put your hand in your pocket
and give the man some money.

95
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,400
Number two, sir.

96
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,839
STREET VENDOR: Hot and fresh!
Fresh today!

97
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
Hot and fresh!

98
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,439
I guessed it was you!

99
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,479
And once Mr Jaggers had said
where you were from

100
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,399
and that there was a connection
to Satis House, I was certain.

101
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,960
You do remember me, don't you?

102
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,119
I hit you.

103
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,400
Yes. Rather hard, if I recall.

104
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,319
I'd like to apologise for my
contemptible behaviour that day.

105
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,279
Something about that house
brings out the worst in people.

106
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,159
I more than asked to receive
a bloody nose.

107
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,880
I assure you I am
a much changed man,

108
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,399
though I understand
if you're not comfortable.

109
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,519
It's just... you knew me before.

110
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,479
And... I don't want before
to follow me here.

111
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,800
I don't want before to follow me,
either.

112
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Let's start again.

113
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,159
Every gentleman belongs to a club
and Finches is one of the best.

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,479
I keep expecting to be turned away.

115
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,319
You have every right to be here.

116
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,720
They're grateful you've set foot
on their carpet.

117
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Sorry.

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,320
Mr Jaggers said you'd been cut off?
Why?

119
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,319
I met a girl.

120
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,799
Clara.

121
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,159
And when my family found out that
her family was of no significance,

122
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,799
they forbade any
further association.

123
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,119
So I defied their judgment and am,
in consequence, quite cut off.

124
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,439
Not a penny.
So, now, I look about me.

125
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,839
You look about you?
For employment.

126
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,879
To support Clara
and the many children we will have

127
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,639
when I can afford for us to marry.

128
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
In the interim, Mr Wemmick
is kind enough to

129
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,960
suggest ways in which I
can make myself useful.

130
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,079
Your wine, sir.

131
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
Thank you.

132
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,640
Herbert, you ain't... haven't asked
how I came by my good fortune.

133
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,880
Well, I gather
there are legal conditions.

134
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,400
One cannot help
but draw conclusions...

135
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,840
You must have made a very great
impression at Satis House.

136
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,879
You don't mind?

137
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,039
Pip, the last person I'd like to have
influence over my life is Miss Havisham.

138
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,119
But if it's what you want. It is.

139
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
Then I'm very happy for you.

140
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,759
Put this hand on, um, on my waist.

141
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,599
No, lightly, Pip.
No gripping, no grasping.

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,719
And you take the other hand,
like so...

143
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,240
Gently! Pip, this is not
a knuckle-crushing competition.

144
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,679
And...

145
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,999
One, two, three.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,479
One, two, three. One...

147
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,879
One... Foot! ..two, three.

148
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
My foot again! ..two, three.

149
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,519
One, two, three. Elbow, two, three.

150
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,600
Ow! Two, three.

151
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,799
Backwards... and forwards.

152
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,359
And then you raise your left hand
gracefully, like this.

153
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,039
Left foot, and right foot.

154
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,320
And twir... Whoa!

155
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,960
Maybe not quite so hard.

156
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
Twirl me.

157
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,160
That was not bad at all!

158
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
THEY LAUGH

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,439
Take one to Mr Denby
with my compliments.

160
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,520
Of course, sir.

161
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,280
I want to be invited to
one of his card games.

162
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:28,039
This is very expensive, Pip.

163
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,359
It's a crucial part of my education.
We'll be more sober next week.

164
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,879
You said that last week!

165
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,319
I'm supposed to be looking about me,
I'm so terribly drunk.

166
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,480
Try harder with your drunkenness
and you won't be so terrible at it.

167
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,279
You're not allowed in here.
This is a gentleman's club.

168
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,999
You're alive, then.

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,879
Us was wondering.

170
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,960
Sir... You've no call to lay
'ands on me. Tell 'em, Pip.

171
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,360
There's no problem here, thank you.

172
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,320
Herbert Pocket.

173
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,839
Would you like to sit down, Mr...?

174
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Gargery.

175
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,240
You take some seeking out.

176
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,079
First off, went to that Jaggers.

177
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,039
They told me where you was livin',
went there, you weren't in,

178
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,960
went back and they told me
you might be here.

179
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,120
I been all over the place
but found you at last.

180
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,560
Lucky the marshes
breeds us determined, eh?

181
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,560
Nothing to say to me, Pip?

182
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,400
Let's go.

183
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,400
DOOR SLAMS

184
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,360
Stop running now, can we?

185
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,600
I wasn't running.

186
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,159
You'll want coffee.
I'll send for some coffee.

187
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,400
Don't care about no coffee.

188
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,400
I want to see you.

189
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,199
You look... different.

190
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,079
It's just a suit.

191
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
You talk different.

192
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,600
Not a word, Pip.

193
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,159
Not one word to say you're safe,
you're well.

194
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,079
I've been very busy.
I haven't noticed the time going by.

195
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,520
Well, it has gone by.

196
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
Months have passed.

197
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,239
And you is missed.

198
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,879
Forge is empty,
house is empty without you.

199
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,919
I'm sorry,
but as you can see, I'm quite well.

200
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,599
Missus lives to hear from you.

201
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
Lives for it.

202
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,360
What else has she got
but starin' at the wall every day?

203
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,679
Write to her. And who would read it?

204
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,959
Pumblechook could read it to her
and to me both.

205
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,159
He merely wants to brag about
how he gave me my first opportunity.

206
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,679
He's a idiot, let him brag,
doesn't do you any hurt.

207
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,760
Does it not?

208
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,760
I will write when I am less busy.

209
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,720
You're shamed.

210
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Shamed of home,
shamed of where you come from.

211
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,119
Shamed of me.

212
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,399
Ain't even looked at me proper.

213
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,920
In the eye.

214
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,040
Like a man.

215
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,280
Joe, you don't understand.

216
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
I understand.

217
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
You're here, too.

218
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,359
I thought it was just
going to be myself and Mr Jaggers.

219
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh, no, it is. I'm just waiting...

220
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,320
Here she is!

221
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,799
SHE CHUCKLES

222
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,119
Pip, this is my fiancee, Clara.
Clara, this is Pip.

223
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,399
I'm very pleased to meet you
at last.

224
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,439
We're going to Mr Wemmick's
in Walworth for our chess night.

225
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,759
He has me in check, but I'm hoping
Clara can get me out of it.

226
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,200
Chess nights with Mr Wemmick?
I didn't know you had chess nights.

227
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,599
To Walworth!

228
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,520
There are sausages for
supper and rhubarb

229
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:05,439
pie with rhubarb
from my own garden

230
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,239
and then, Herbert, I shall
take your king in three moves.

231
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,679
Ah, we shall see about that,
Mr Wemmick.

232
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,519
I sense a humiliating defeat.

233
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,799
THEY LAUGH

234
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,759
Pip, Mr Jaggers is waiting for you.

235
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,279
Mike! Mind the shop.

236
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,680
Come on, you two! I won't be late.

237
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,519
I have some delicious hedgerow wine,
Herbert.

238
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,640
If you can keep clear head
after THAT...

239
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
Still no sign?

240
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
None, Mr Jaggers.

241
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,000
You're early, Pip.

242
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,799
No matter, since my previous
appointment has failed to appear.

243
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,440
Follow.

244
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,839
I apologise.
It's just I saw Estella's name.

245
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,799
Miss Havisham Senior.

246
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,719
They have the same name?
But I thought Estella was adopted.

247
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,039
She is. Then how is it
that they have the same name?

248
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,878
I can understand the Havisham
but Estella

249
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:17,560
was surely not born
with the name Estella.

250
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:20,759
How insatiably curious you are
about those two ladies.

251
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,999
Curiosity is natural
under the circumstances.

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,919
Curiosity killed the cat.
And nature can be most brutal.

253
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,960
Sit.

254
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,159
This is a very kind invitation,
Mr Jaggers.

255
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,519
Kindness has nothing to do with it.

256
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,239
I am obliged as guardian
to meet with those in my care

257
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,599
and send reports as to how they do.

258
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,480
And what would you say of me?

259
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,000
I would scarcely have known you.

260
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,560
Thank you, Molly.

261
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,880
You have a lot of unpaid bills.

262
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,639
I don't.

263
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,039
I mean, I do.

264
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,519
But they're not unpaid, they're just
not paid yet. But they will be.

265
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,039
You have bills at your club,
with your tailor,

266
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,640
bills for furniture...

267
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,279
A pianoforte?!

268
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,679
Yes. Your allowance is plentiful.
Be more prudent.

269
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,560
Mr Jaggers, you're unfair.

270
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:39,439
You say it is plentiful but
it doesn't go anywhere.

271
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,199
I do not recall inviting you to
enter a plea of mitigation.

272
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,279
But it's true.

273
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,880
You have to write a report
to my benefactor and she...

274
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,600
My benefactor, whoever
they may be, needs

275
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,679
to know that I am making...
improvements,

276
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,559
that I am changing and if I stay within
my allowance, I won't improve or change.

277
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,399
So all my expenses
are very reasonable and necessary.

278
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,719
Debt is debt
and you are being profligate.

279
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,519
I have already advocated caution

280
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,919
and I am NOT in the habit
of repeating myself.

281
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,719
And you are very late, Mr Drummle.

282
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,800
I am, aren't I?

283
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,320
Mike will let you out.

284
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,960
Who are you?

285
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm Pip.

286
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,000
Pip?

287
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,760
I left my glove...

288
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,860
It is time you stopped
acting like a child

289
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:55,799
and started behaving
like a gentleman.

290
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,879
There have been too many regrettable
and unpleasant incidents.

291
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,959
There's a threat
of charges being brought.

292
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,679
Throw some coins at the charges
and they will disappear.

293
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,839
For heaven's sake, Jaggers,
don't bother me with such trifles.

294
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,159
You will learn to
curb your excesses, Mr Drummle,

295
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,400
or I will write to your father
and wash my hands of you!

296
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,240
I... lost my glove.

297
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,200
Thank you, Molly.

298
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,879
MISS HAVISHAM: 'My dear Pip,

299
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,679
'I wonder if you might visit me.

300
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,239
'Estella is returned
and requires an escort to Richmond.

301
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,200
'And I am keen to see your
transformation first-hand.'

302
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,400
Pip.

303
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,760
How very handsome you look.

304
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,999
Thank you, Miss Havisham.

305
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,640
I was not expecting you so soon.

306
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
I thought you might want
to visit your people.

307
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,999
But of course,
what was fit company for you once

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,640
is not fit now.

309
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,320
As is only right.

310
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
Here is Estella.

311
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, look at you both.

312
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,679
Not quite the finished articles.

313
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,920
But you will be. Soon.

314
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,520
And I shall be very proud.

315
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,440
Goodbye, Mother.

316
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,839
I will write.

317
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,839
And you will respond promptly.

318
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
Of course.

319
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,119
Miss Havisham, if I may be so bold,
your gatekeeper, Dolge Orlick.

320
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,479
What of him?

321
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,399
I know him.

322
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,920
He is not trustworthy.

323
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,919
He should not be allowed
the care of a lady.

324
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,359
How very vigilant you are
on my behalf.

325
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,719
Almost proprietorial.

326
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,720
He will be dismissed
and someone else found.

327
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,280
Miss Havisham.

328
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,920
SHE BREATHES HALTINGLY

329
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,639
Weren't my last words to you
not to come back here?

330
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,519
To forget about this house
and everyone in it?

331
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,799
There was a change
in my circumstances.

332
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,600
A very great change.

333
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,040
So I can see.

334
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,919
Who do you stay with in Richmond?
A Mrs Brandley.

335
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,680
She is to be my chaperone.

336
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,720
One more stranger
given the charge of me.

337
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,559
I am happy
there'll be one familiar face.

338
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,840
I hope we shall be together often.

339
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,359
I'm starting to despair.

340
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,040
It seems every bank
and insurer...

341
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,079
In fact, every business in London's
getting on fine without me.

342
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,439
Herbert, you know if you need
anything, you only have to ask.

343
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,639
I want to work. I want to marry.

344
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,279
At the moment, all I'm doing
is proving my family right,

345
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,519
that I'd never make a thing
of myself without them.

346
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,560
I'm sorry, Pip.
I'm being very miserable.

347
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,159
It's a special occasion.

348
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,039
I have something to tell you.

349
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,120
I've kept it to myself,
but I can't any longer.

350
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm in love.

351
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,400
That's very good news!
Does the lady have a name?

352
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,120
Estella. I'm in love with Estella.

353
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,719
Well? Would you not be happy for me?

354
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,239
That house...

355
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,999
Does it not feel haunted to you?
Poisoned, somehow?

356
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,398
If Miss Havisham keeps her
fiance's memory alive,

357
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,358
I don't call that poison,
I call that love.

358
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,640
Compeyson didn't die.

359
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:43,999
It would have been better if he had.

360
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,080
He was a con man, Pip.

361
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,759
He asked Miss Havisham
to settle money on him.

362
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,679
A great deal of money.

363
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,998
And on the day of the wedding,
he sent her a note.

364
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,240
He was never seen again.

365
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:56,760
He jilted her.

366
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,039
And a little while after...

367
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,239
it was heard that
she had adopted a little girl.

368
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,639
That day we met, I heard your father
say something about Estella,

369
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,559
that no-one knows who she is?

370
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,959
We were told she was the orphaned
child of friends.

371
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,119
No friends anyone had ever heard of.

372
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,460
Is that why you're not happy
for me, because no-one knows

373
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:19,799
where Estella is from?
I expected better from you.

374
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,039
No, that's not it at all!

375
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,439
Compeyson's betrayal hangs around
Satis House like a curse.

376
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,879
It festers and Miss Havisham
lets it fester.

377
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,919
Estella has grown up with that,

378
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,879
surrounded by its influence
every single day.

379
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,280
You do not know Estella!

380
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,839
I love her.

381
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,519
When I reach my majority,
we will be married.

382
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,799
Just tread carefully, Pip.
Be cautious.

383
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,540
Everyone is telling me to
be cautious these days.

384
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,279
I am sick of caution.

385
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,119
Quite right, Pip.
Caution is very boring.

386
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,079
Pocket.

387
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,240
Drummle.

388
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,039
You know each other?

389
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,280
We schooled together.
Didn't we, Herbert?

390
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,800
Goodbye.

391
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,479
Dear old Empty Pocket.

392
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,039
I wonder if he didn't cut
himself off from his family

393
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,800
for some girl in order to make
himself the tiniest bit memorable.

394
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,560
Where did you school, Pip?

395
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,399
Privately. At home.

396
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,120
Lucky you.

397
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,279
I appear to be drinking all your
champagne, how fearfully rude of me.

398
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,199
Yes, well, we'll get another.
It would be my pleasure.

399
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
I do like new people.

400
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,200
Mr Wemmick?

401
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,678
It is not the day
for your allowance.

402
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:38,958
I know, I wanted to speak to you
on a private matter.

403
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:41,400
Make an appointment with the clerks
to see Mr Jaggers.

404
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:44,399
This isn't something
I'd wish to discuss with Mr Jaggers.

405
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,879
I thought you'd be more suitable.
No-one more suitable than Jaggers.

406
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,279
If you'd just hear me out. We could
have luncheon at my club. Luncheon?

407
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,959
I'm too busy for luncheon
at your club or anywhere else.

408
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,200
Then I'd be happy
to come to Walworth

409
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:58,439
when you'd have more
leisure to listen...

410
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,679
Make an appointment with the clerks.

411
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,040
Now you'll excuse me,
I have urgent business to conduct.

412
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,080
You really don't like me very much,
do you, Mr Wemmick?

413
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,040
I don't know who you are.

414
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,399
SHOUTING

415
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,559
Down there.

416
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,119
And what will happen to
your property when you are dropped?

417
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,860
Pondering your immortal soul
and how you will explain

418
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:35,599
yourself to the Almighty,
that's all very well,

419
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,319
but these chickens need water,
grain, a coop.

420
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,520
You're condemned but they can be
saved, if you bequeath them to me.

421
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,879
HE LAUGHS

422
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,159
Yep.

423
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,439
They'll join my flock at Walworth
and be well looked after.

424
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,399
I wish you a good ending.
The ropeman is Noakes.

425
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,759
Ties a strong knot.

426
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,140
What are you doing here?
If I must follow you to

427
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:00,519
Newgate to have an
audience with you, I will.

428
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,559
Did you just take his chickens?
I accepted his bequest.

429
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,999
And he has no further need of them.
What is this matter then?

430
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,760
Herbert still hasn't
found a situation.

431
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:12,519
That is because he requires
capital to buy into a firm.

432
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,239
Capital that Herbert doesn't have.
But I do.

433
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,639
Or I will have.

434
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,680
Mr Wemmick, I want to use my
expectations to help Herbert

435
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:22,159
but it has to be completely secret
and I don't know how to go about it.

436
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,959
So I... thought of you.

437
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,319
I would counsel very strongly
against such help being given.

438
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,959
Such dissolution of your portable
property is most ill-advised.

439
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,159
You see these?

440
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,920
You see these?

441
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,399
These are all part
of my portable property

442
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,879
and I do not give one
piece of it away.

443
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,279
Nor should you yours.

444
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,039
This is the advice
of Mr Wemmick, Jaggers' chief clerk?

445
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,799
It is.

446
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,120
And what does the Mr Wemmick who
grows his own rhubarb say?

447
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,439
They're a firm of shipping insurers.
Venerable and well respected.

448
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,399
Herbert had written to them some
time ago. That would be perfect.

449
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
How will they explain
why they're giving

450
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:02,399
him this opportunity
when he's penniless?

451
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,480
I've thought of that.

452
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:05,440
Old Mr Clarriker will
tell Herbert he was

453
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,399
touched by his obvious
passion for ships

454
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,439
and wants to support a young man
looking to strike out on his own

455
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,239
without the cushion of family money.
It's a terrible lie.

456
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,279
For a very good cause.
I've rather enjoyed my mission.

457
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,999
The cloak and dagger.
Without the dagger.

458
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
The capital required is £500.

459
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,599
Can you pay a portion of that
from what is in my allowance?

460
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,239
I can, but what will you live on?

461
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,319
I am going to inherit a fortune,
Mr Wemmick. A fortune!

462
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,440
Money is not a concern.
Tell Clarrikers they

463
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:34,559
will receive the full
amount on my majority.

464
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,719
They understand that Herbert
must never know? They're a business.

465
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,100
As long as they get their
capital, they're happy

466
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:42,480
with any conditions.
I shall close the deal.

467
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,200
It seems not everything
in this world is venal.

468
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,559
Mrs Brandley. My dear.

469
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,599
The whirligig of the season is upon
us once more.

470
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,279
And these are your daughters?
Yes.

471
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,560
Such beauties! Thank you.

472
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,759
Surely you are not nervous?

473
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,479
I am sick of being looked at.

474
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,840
I am sick of being evaluated.

475
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,720
And the women are the very worst.

476
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,399
None of them can hold
a candle to you, Estella.

477
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,400
May I introduce Mr Pirrip
and Miss Estella Havisham?

478
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,480
Ladies. Mr Pirrip.

479
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,519
Miss Havisham, I've called several
times but you are always indisposed.

480
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,839
How have I insulted you?
I don't know what I've done.

481
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,840
You are making
a spectacle of yourself, Sir.

482
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,359
(Did you see that? I did.)

483
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,880
Bidding will be very fierce
this year.

484
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,759
CHATTERING

485
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,879
Mr Pirrip,
you are being much admired.

486
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,200
Do take an interest or their doting
mama will be most offended.

487
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,879
I am flattered by their interest but
I am clearly escorting another lady.

488
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,360
This is a market, Mr Pirrip.

489
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:25,359
All the stock must be assessed.

490
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,240
CHATTERING

491
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,599
We are friends.

492
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,519
Indeed?

493
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,919
He is quite the bachelor du jour.

494
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,479
A baronet, will inherit the title
and the estate.

495
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,440
Breeding, bloodlines
and proven provenance.

496
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,800
You said you and Mr Drummle
were friends. I wonder.

497
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,919
Drummle.

498
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,479
Pip. You've been seeing my tailor.

499
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,839
We could almost be twins.

500
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,079
How charming to see you again,
Miss Havisham.

501
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,600
Excuse me.

502
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,599
HE EXHALES

503
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,360
I wondered if we might talk later.

504
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,239
We could go to Finches?

505
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,719
Oh, I think we can do better
than Finches.

506
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm going to my other club tonight.

507
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,960
You'll like it there.

508
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,199
We are both gentlemen, are we not?

509
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,759
We are, yes.

510
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,440
Then, speak freely.

511
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,759
There is an understanding between
myself and Miss Estella Havisham.

512
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,639
There has been for some years.

513
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,800
I would not wish for you to become
attached and then be disappointed.

514
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,359
Well, that's very decent of you
to let me know, Pip.

515
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Very decent indeed.

516
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
Glad you understand.

517
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,160
Pip.

518
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,520
What sort of a name is Pip?
Who calls a man Pip? Pippety Pip.

519
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
Gentlemen.

520
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,360
Her and her.

521
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,839
You like to spend, don't you?
So, spend.

522
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,599
You can have what you like
and no-one cares.

523
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,920
Whatever your impulses demand.

524
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,319
No?

525
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,719
I shouldn't be here.

526
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,159
Oh, dear. Ladies, it seems
that my friend Pippy is a virgin.

527
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,239
LAUGHTER

528
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,919
Poor little virgin.
He doesn't know what to do!

529
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,879
Just copy me, Pippy. Isn't that how
you get by? Isn't that how you pass?

530
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,319
By throwing your money around
and copying me, Pippety Pippety Pip?

531
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,159
Stop calling me that.
I know exactly what you are.

532
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,080
You're not one of us.

533
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
You know I know, don't you, Pip?

534
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,760
Who's there?

535
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,159
How well do you know
Bentley Drummle?

536
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,520
You should not
worry about Mr Drummle.

537
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,959
He will not get
a moment's joy from me.

538
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,639
He is not what he says he is.

539
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,320
None of us are.

540
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,439
Not you.

541
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,240
Not me.

542
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,320
Estella...

543
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,920
Do you remember anything about
your life before Satis House?

544
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,960
I'm not sure.

545
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,600
MRS BRANDLEY SNORES

546
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,920
THEY LAUGH

547
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,560
I know it was you.

548
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,480
I'll never say.

549
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,559
Thank you, Pip.

550
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
You're a good, good friend.

551
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,200
Go and congratulate him.

552
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,839
'Estella, at last!
Why did you not come sooner?'

553
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,679
I've been waiting and waiting. Look!
See, I keep them all.

554
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,759
I read them over and over,

555
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,239
but they're not detailed enough,
Estella.

556
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,159
Can I not at least remove my gloves?

557
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,599
I must hear.

558
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,919
Come. Come. Tell me everything,

559
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,040
I must hear it all.

560
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,600
Get him whatever he wants!

561
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,359
FAINT VOICES ARGUE

562
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,840
I don't want to read them,
read them to yourself.

563
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:09,399
That's the least I deserve after all
I've given you.

564
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,440
I've done all you've
asked for and more.

565
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,479
Where are you going?
I'm tired. I want to rest.

566
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,479
I've told you everything.
Tell me again!

567
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,120
What did he look like? did he weep?
Tell me!

568
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,319
How can you be so cold?

569
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,399
It's what you trained me to be.

570
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,839
Leave me alone.

571
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,119
No! I will not let you leave me!

572
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
You will not leave me!

573
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,920
Where is Miss Havisham?

574
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,200
She retired early.

575
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,880
There was an argument.

576
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
She wants me to love her.

577
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,920
But I cannot.

578
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,760
Why?

579
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,960
Because I do not have a heart.

580
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,040
That's not true, Estella.

581
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,600
I know it's not true.

582
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,879
'Are you a gentleman yet?'

583
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,519
That is for you to tell me,
Miss Havisham.

584
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,200
You look the part.

585
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,199
You sound the part.

586
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,160
Your good opinion's all that
matters to me, Miss Havisham.

587
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,080
And I reach my majority soon.

588
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,159
The time goes by quickly.

589
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,440
Your destiny approaches.

590
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,599
I will write. As usual.

591
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,359
Tell you of my progress.

592
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,960
So cold.

593
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,559
I am what you designed me to be.

594
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,279
I am your blade.

595
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,560
You cannot now complain
if you also feel the hurt.

596
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,440
Miss Havisham.

597
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,999
'My dear Pip.
This is your Uncle Pumblechook,

598
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,119
'making so bold as to convey
with the deepest regrets

599
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,160
'that your sister is dead.'

600
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,240
Sad day, Joe.

601
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,360
I'll wait for you.

602
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,080
She had been sinking fast, Mr Pip.

603
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,400
In many ways,
it's a blessed relief.

604
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,239
Now Joe can start working again.
The forge has been completely idle.

605
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,439
Is this bespoke, Mr Pip?
Of course it's bespoke!

606
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,359
It is the quality way now
to only wear bespoke.

607
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,359
What do you mean, working again?
The forge, idle?

608
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,279
He couldn't run the forge and do
everything your dear sister needed.

609
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,119
Not all alone.

610
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,879
You do cut a dash, Mr Pip.
A dash indeed.

611
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,279
I've arranged the wake.

612
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,479
A lot of people excited to see you.

613
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,159
In the end, I had to ticket
the event, such was the demand.

614
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,279
I can now get a new
pony for the trap.

615
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,840
She was your niece and you charged
people to go to her wake?

616
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,879
It's what she would have wanted.

617
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,399
We shall see you there, Mr Pip, Sir.

618
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,960
There's boiled ham and a plum duff.

619
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,080
Tried to keep up the house but just
ain't got the touch Missus had.

620
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,359
She was a terror for dust.
Joe, you did everything you could.

621
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,960
No man could have done more.

622
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,399
You'll be wanted at the wake.

623
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,280
I'm not going to that.

624
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,639
Your room's the same from when you
left. I put sheets on the bed.

625
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,759
No, Joe, I can't stay.

626
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,999
I have to go back to London.

627
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,280
I'm taking Estella to a ball.
I... promised.

You should move swiftly, Mr Pirrip.

633
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,559
He is most taken with her

634
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,200
and he's very used
to getting what he wants.

635
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,880
Then want must be his master.

Ladies.

637
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,199
Swine-herd? Bird scarer?

638
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,480
To what do you refer?
I'm trying to guess

639
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,759
what you did before
you got your money.

640
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,559
Do the voice, Pippety-Pip.
What voice?

641
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,079
The voice you had before you worked
so hard to get this one.

642
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,799
Where are you from, Pippy?
Who are you?

643
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,159
I am a gentleman.
Oh, but you're not.

644
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,319
Any more than she is a lady.

645
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,479
Something about the pair of you
doesn't smell quite right.

646
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,679
But at least
she doesn't curdle the milk.

647
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,199
Shepherd?

648
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,679
Or did you pick stones out
of fields to earn your meagre crust?

649
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,200
Will you take me to my carriage?
I wish to go home. Miss Havisham.

650
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,960
Pip.

651
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,920
Thank you for rescuing me.

652
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:12,759
I shall have to try
and avoid him in future.

653
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,159
The season will be over
and he will go back to his estate

654
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,999
a married man and you will not
have to see him again.

655
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,279
How do you know?

656
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,200
It is the sort of thing I know.

657
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,080
We shall all be married soon.

658
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,880
Indeed we shall.

659
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,880
LAUGHTER

660
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,239
I would like to say a few words.

661
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,400
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

662
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:41,639
First of all, I would like to thank
Clara's dear Papa

663
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,039
for allowing me to marry
his beloved daughter, finally.

664
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,559
LAUGHTER

665
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,519
I will treasure her, Sir.

666
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,879
And I would like to thank you,
my friends, for celebrating with us.

667
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,319
And I would like to thank my wife,
for marrying me

668
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,919
and making me
the most blessed man in the world.

669
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,359
APPLAUSE

670
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,079
And... and I have an announcement.

671
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,760
Clarrikers are opening
a new office in Cairo.

672
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,679
And I've been asked to help
set it up. And I've accepted.

673
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:22,479
So, to friends, to Cairo
and to Mrs Clara Pocket!

674
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,480
Mrs Clara Pocket! Thank you.

675
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,040
Good night!

676
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,879
Cairo.

677
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,639
It's not the ends of the earth.
You can visit.

678
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,159
He's very happy, Pip.

679
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,240
As you should be. You come into
your majority tomorrow.

680
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,959
I'll find out
the identity of my benefactor.

681
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,639
You will receive
your portable property.

682
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,439
No more waiting.

683
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,320
Your life will begin in earnest.

684
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,280
Life begins.

685
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,559
Get out! Get out or I'll strike you!

686
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,280
You don't want to do that, Pip.

687
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,440
How do you know my name?

688
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:04,239
Who are you?

689
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,880
You know me, boy.

690
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,040
Abel Magwitch.

691
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,319
Don't be scared.
I mean you no harm.

692
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,919
What are you doing here?
What do you want from me?

693
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,320
I brought you something.

694
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,920
Something you been waiting on.

695
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,399
What's this?

696
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,080
It's your fortune.

697
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,760
Your fortune what was promised.

698
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,440
It's me that done this for you.

699
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,840
It's me that is your benefactor.

700
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,960
You're my gentleman, Pip.

701
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,119
It's not how I wanted it, Pip.

702
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,399
You should have stayed
in New South Wales.

703
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,120
No, I won't let you do it!

704
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,919
He is a lifer who has
defied the law. He will hang.

705
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,280
You could have been happy.

706
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:41,400
Oh! Don't touch me.

707
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,520
You know nothing about men,
Miss Havisham.

708
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,800
WOMAN SCREAMS

709
