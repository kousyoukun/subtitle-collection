1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Do you not want it?

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,400
Varmint nonpareil, as they say.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,200
Bound for the end of the world now.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,040
Perhaps you, like Estella,
will be extraordinary.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,120
Why would I want to be
friends with you?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,520
Thought you might be lonely.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,560
Missus!

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,840
Do you not think, Pip,
that Estella is beautiful?

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,080
Pip has a fortune.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,040
The owner of this handsome property
also desires

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,600
that Mr. Pirrip
immediately go to London,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,000
where he is to live as a young
fellow of great expectations.

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,280
London and Inns of Court!

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
Thank you. Sir.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,560
Where's Mr. Jaggers' office?

16
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,280
I'm first. I'm first! I've been
waiting longer than anyone!

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm first! Amelia, I have told you,
over and over,

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,960
I know enough of your husband
to keep him from the drop.

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,360
I do not want to know the truth,
the law does not require it!

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,880
And you, sir, must pay Wemmick
the full cost,

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,800
only then can we discuss the
mitigation of your circumstances.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
I can pay you double!

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,600
If you'll be for my brother,
I can pay you double!

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
It is too late.

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,160
I am already on
the other side of the floor.

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,240
You are against him?

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
Follow.

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,520
Have mercy! Mr. Jaggers! Mr. Jaggers!

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
Follow.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,320
So the young gentleman
of expectations arrives in London.

31
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,760
Every Friday,
you and other young men of means

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,760
for whose families
I perform the function of guardian,

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,880
will come here to receive
your allowance for that week.

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
Are you listening?

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,200
Yes, Mr. Jaggers.

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,680
This will continue
until you come of age

37
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,000
and receive your fortune,

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,480
which you may carefully preserve
for posterity

39
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,040
or squander
inside a calendar month.

40
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,320
At that point,
you may do as you will,

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,360
because you are no longer
under my charge.

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,640
Until then, you do...

43
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
as I say.

44
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,360
What's for lunch?

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,920
A kidney pie, Mr. Jaggers.
The gravy is most fragrant.

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,200
Rooms have been arranged for you
at Barnard's Inn,

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,560
where you are to share
with young Mr. Pocket.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,040
Herbert Pocket?

49
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,160
Mr. Pocket has been engaged to help
habituate you to your new life.

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,680
This can't be right.

51
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Herbert's related to Miss Havisham
and she's...

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,160
The proviso, Pip.

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,040
You do not discuss
or speculate as to the identity

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,400
of your benefactor until they
themselves reveal their identity

55
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,560
at your majority or very soon after.

56
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,640
I know but...

57
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,520
But nothing!

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
Young Mr. Pocket has been
cut off from his family.

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,040
He is Mr. Wemmick's suggestion.
If it proves unsatisfactory,

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,680
we will endeavour to find
someone more suitable.

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,160
Mr. Wemmick will give you the first
instalment of your allowance.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,080
Be prudent with it.
Do not fall into debt.

63
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,680
Questions?

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,880
I wondered if Miss Havisham
had told you

65
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,800
when Estella might be comin'
to London?

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,440
And why would I be furnished

67
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,880
with the details of
that young lady's itinerary?

68
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,320
I just thought that...
Do not think, Pip.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,160
It never leads to anywhere edifying.

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
Back to the Bailey!

71
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
What's that head, Mr. Wemmick?

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,640
One lost to the drop.

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,520
The cast taken
when he was fresh down.

74
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
Why does Mr. Jaggers keep it?

75
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,360
It was the man's request.

76
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,040
He ended up in the common pit.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,000
No marker, no stone
to say he'd ever existed.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,760
And he was one of the best at
his trade until the law did for him.

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,400
He wanted to be remembered.
Jaggers honoured his final wish.

80
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,640
It's horrible. It is his sentinel.

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,680
Memento mori.

82
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,120
Sign here, please.

83
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Mike?

84
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Show Mr. Pip the way to Barnard's Inn
and introduce him to the watchman.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,840
It's not Mr. Pip, it's just Pip.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,560
It's in the proviso.

87
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,200
Just Pip.

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
Just Pip.

89
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,600
New one for you.

90
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,920
Put your hand in your pocket
and give the man some money.

91
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,400
Number two, sir.

92
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,840
Hot and fresh!
Fresh today!

93
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
Hot and fresh!

94
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,440
I guessed it was you!

95
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,480
And once Mr. Jaggers had said
where you were from

96
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,400
and that there was a connection
to Satis House, I was certain.

97
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,960
You do remember me, don't you?

98
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
I hit you.

99
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,400
Yes. Rather hard, if I recall.

100
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,320
I'd like to apologise for my
contemptible behaviour that day.

101
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,280
Something about that house
brings out the worst in people.

102
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,160
I more than asked to receive
a bloody nose.

103
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,880
I assure you I am
a much changed man,

104
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,400
though I understand
if you're not comfortable.

105
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,520
It's just...you knew me before.

106
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,480
And...I don't want before
to follow me here.

107
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,800
I don't want before to follow me,
either.

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Let's start again.

109
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,160
Every gentleman belongs to a club
and Finches is one of the best.

110
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,480
I keep expecting to be turned away.

111
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,320
You have every right to be here.

112
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,720
They're grateful you've set foot
on their carpet.

113
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Sorry.

114
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,320
Mr. Jaggers said you'd been cut off?
Why?

115
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,320
I met a girl.

116
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,800
Clara.

117
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,160
And when my family found out that
her family was of no significance,

118
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,800
they forbade any
further association.

119
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,120
So I defied their judgment and am,
in consequence, quite cut off.

120
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,440
Not a penny.
So, now, I look about me.

121
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,840
You look about you?
For employment.

122
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,880
To support Clara
and the many children we will have

123
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
when I can afford for us to marry.

124
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,960
In the interim, Mr. Wemmick
is kind enough to suggest ways
in which I can make myself useful.

125
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,080
Your wine, sir.

126
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
Thank you.

127
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,640
Herbert, you ain't... haven't asked
how I came by my good fortune.

128
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,880
Well, I gather
there are legal conditions.

129
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,400
One cannot help
but draw conclusions...

130
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,840
You must have made a very great
impression at Satis House.

131
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,880
You don't mind?

132
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,040
Pip, the last person I'd like
to have influence over my life
is Miss Havisham.

133
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
But if it's what you want. It is.

134
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
Then I'm very happy for you.

135
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,760
Put this hand on, um, on my waist.

136
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,600
No, lightly, Pip.
No gripping, no grasping.

137
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,720
And you take the other hand,
like so...

138
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,240
Gently! Pip, this is not
a knuckle-crushing competition.

139
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,680
And...

140
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,000
One, two, three.

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,480
One, two, three. One...

142
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,880
One... Foot! ..two, three.

143
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
My foot again! ..two, three.

144
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,520
One, two, three. Elbow, two, three.

145
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,600
Ow! Two, three.

146
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,800
Backwards...and forwards.

147
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,360
And then you raise your left hand
gracefully, like this.

148
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,040
Left foot, and right foot.

149
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,320
And twir... Whoa!

150
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,960
Maybe not quite so hard.

151
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
Twirl me.

152
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,160
That was not bad at all!

153
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,440
Take one to Mr. Denby
with my compliments.

154
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,520
Of course, sir.

155
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,040
I want to be invited
to one of his card games.
This is very expensive, Pip.

156
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,360
It's a crucial part of my education.
We'll be more sober next week.

157
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,880
You said that last week!

158
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,320
I'm supposed to be looking about me,
I'm so terribly drunk.

159
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,480
Try harder with your drunkenness
and you won't be so terrible at it.

160
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,280
You're not allowed in here.
This is a gentleman's club.

161
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,000
You're alive, then.

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,880
Us was wondering.

163
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,960
Sir... You've no call to lay
'ands on me. Tell 'em, Pip.

164
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,360
There's no problem here, thank you.

165
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,320
Herbert Pocket.

166
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,840
Would you like to sit down, Mr...?

167
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Gargery.

168
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,240
You take some seeking out.

169
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,080
First off, went to that Jaggers.

170
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,040
They told me where you was livin',
went there, you weren't in,

171
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,960
went back and they told me
you might be here.

172
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,120
I been all over the place
but found you at last.

173
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,560
Lucky the marshes
breeds us determined, eh?

174
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,560
Nothing to say to me, Pip?

175
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,400
Let's go.

176
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,360
Stop running now, can we?

177
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,600
I wasn't running.

178
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,160
You'll want coffee.
I'll send for some coffee.

179
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,400
Don't care about no coffee.

180
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,400
I want to see you.

181
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,200
You look...different.

182
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,080
It's just a suit.

183
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
You talk different.

184
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,600
Not a word, Pip.

185
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,160
Not one word to say you're safe,
you're well.

186
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,080
I've been very busy.
I haven't noticed the time going by.

187
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,520
Well, it has gone by.

188
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
Months have passed.

189
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,240
And you is missed.

190
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,880
Forge is empty,
house is empty without you.

191
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm sorry,
but as you can see, I'm quite well.

192
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,600
Missus lives to hear from you.

193
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
Lives for it.

194
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,360
What else has she got
but starin' at the wall every day?

195
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,680
Write to her. And who would read it?

196
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,960
Pumblechook could read it to her
and to me both.

197
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,160
He merely wants to brag about
how he gave me my first opportunity.

198
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,680
He's a idiot, let him brag,
doesn't do you any hurt.

199
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,760
Does it not?

200
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,760
I will write when I am less busy.

201
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,720
You're shamed.

202
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Shamed of home,
shamed of where you come from.

203
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,120
Shamed of me.

204
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,400
Ain't even looked at me proper.

205
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,920
In the eye.

206
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,040
Like a man.

207
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,280
Joe, you don't understand.

208
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
I understand.

209
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
You're here, too.

210
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,360
I thought it was just
going to be myself and Mr. Jaggers.

211
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh, no, it is. I'm just waiting...

212
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,320
Here she is!

213
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,120
Pip, this is my fiancee, Clara.
Clara, this is Pip.

214
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,400
I'm very pleased to meet you
at last.

215
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,440
We're going to Mr. Wemmick's
in Walworth for our chess night.

216
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,760
He has me in check, but I'm hoping
Clara can get me out of it.

217
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,200
Chess nights with Mr. Wemmick?
I didn't know you had chess nights.

218
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,600
To Walworth!

219
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,440
There are sausages for supper
and rhubarb pie
with rhubarb from my own garden

220
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,240
and then, Herbert, I shall
take your king in three moves.

221
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
Ah, we shall see about that,
Mr. Wemmick.

222
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,520
I sense a humiliating defeat.

223
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,760
Pip, Mr. Jaggers is waiting for you.

224
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,280
Mike! Mind the shop.

225
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,680
Come on, you two! I won't be late.

226
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,520
I have some delicious hedgerow wine,
Herbert.

227
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,640
If you can keep clear head
after that...

228
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
Still no sign?

229
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
None, Mr. Jaggers.

230
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,000
You're early, Pip.

231
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,800
No matter, since my previous
appointment has failed to appear.

232
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,440
Follow.

233
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
I apologise.
It's just I saw Estella's name.

234
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
Miss Havisham Senior.

235
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,720
They have the same name?
But I thought Estella was adopted.

236
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,040
She is. Then how is it
that they have the same name?

237
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,880
I can understand the Havisham
but Estella

238
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,560
was surely not born
with the name Estella.

239
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,760
How insatiably curious you are
about those two ladies.

240
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,000
Curiosity is natural
under the circumstances.

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,920
Curiosity killed the cat.
And nature can be most brutal.

242
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,960
Sit.

243
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,160
This is a very kind invitation,
Mr. Jaggers.

244
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,520
Kindness has nothing to do with it.

245
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,240
I am obliged as guardian
to meet with those in my care

246
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,600
and send reports as to how they do.

247
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,480
And what would you say of me?

248
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,000
I would scarcely have known you.

249
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,560
Thank you, Molly.

250
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,880
You have a lot of unpaid bills.

251
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
I don't.

252
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
I mean, I do.

253
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,520
But they're not unpaid, they're just
not paid yet. But they will be.

254
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,040
You have bills at your club,
with your tailor,

255
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,640
bills for furniture...

256
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,280
A pianoforte?!

257
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,680
Yes. Your allowance is plentiful.
Be more prudent.

258
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,440
Mr. Jaggers, you're unfair.
You say it is plentiful
but it doesn't go anywhere.

259
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,200
I do not recall inviting you to
enter a plea of mitigation.

260
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,280
But it's true.

261
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,880
You have to write a report
to my benefactor and she...

262
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,680
My benefactor, whoever they may be,
needs to know that I am making...
improvements,

263
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,560
that I am changing
and if I stay within my allowance,
I won't improve or change.

264
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,400
So all my expenses
are very reasonable and necessary.

265
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,720
Debt is debt
and you are being profligate.

266
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,520
I have already advocated caution

267
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,920
and I am NOT in the habit
of repeating myself.

268
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,720
And you are very late, Mr. Drummle.

269
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,800
I am, aren't I?

270
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,320
Mike will let you out.

271
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,960
Who are you?

272
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm Pip.

273
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,000
Pip?

274
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,760
I left my glove...

275
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,800
It is time you stopped
acting like a child and started
behaving like a gentleman.

276
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,880
There have been too many regrettable
and unpleasant incidents.

277
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
There's a threat
of charges being brought.

278
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,680
Throw some coins at the charges
and they will disappear.

279
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,840
For heaven's sake, Jaggers,
don't bother me with such trifles.

280
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,160
You will learn to
curb your excesses, Mr. Drummle,

281
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,400
or I will write to your father
and wash my hands of you!

282
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,240
I...lost my glove.

283
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,200
Thank you, Molly.

284
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,880
'My dear Pip,

285
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,680
'I wonder if you might visit me.

286
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,240
'Estella is returned
and requires an escort to Richmond.

287
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,200
'And I am keen to see your
transformation first-hand.'

288
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,400
Pip.

289
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,760
How very handsome you look.

290
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,000
Thank you, Miss Havisham.

291
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,640
I was not expecting you so soon.

292
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
I thought you might want
to visit your people.

293
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,000
But of course,
what was fit company for you once

294
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,640
is not fit now.

295
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,320
As is only right.

296
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
Here is Estella.

297
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, look at you both.

298
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,680
Not quite the finished articles.

299
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,920
But you will be. Soon.

300
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,520
And I shall be very proud.

301
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,440
Goodbye, Mother.

302
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,840
I will write.

303
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,840
And you will respond promptly.

304
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
Of course.

305
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,120
Miss Havisham, if I may be so bold,
your gatekeeper, Dolge Orlick.

306
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,480
What of him?

307
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
I know him.

308
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,920
He is not trustworthy.

309
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,920
He should not be allowed
the care of a lady.

310
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,360
How very vigilant you are
on my behalf.

311
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,720
Almost proprietorial.

312
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,720
He will be dismissed
and someone else found.

313
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,280
Miss Havisham.

314
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,640
Weren't my last words to you
not to come back here?

315
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,520
To forget about this house
and everyone in it?

316
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,800
There was a change
in my circumstances.

317
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,600
A very great change.

318
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,040
So I can see.

319
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,920
Who do you stay with in Richmond?
A Mrs. Brandley.

320
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,680
She is to be my chaperone.

321
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,720
One more stranger
given the charge of me.

322
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,560
I am happy
there'll be one familiar face.

323
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,840
I hope we shall be together often.

324
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,360
I'm starting to despair.

325
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,040
It seems every bank
and insurer...

326
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,080
In fact, every business in London's
getting on fine without me.

327
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,440
Herbert, you know if you need
anything, you only have to ask.

328
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,640
I want to work. I want to marry.

329
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,280
At the moment, all I'm doing
is proving my family right,

330
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,520
that I'd never make a thing
of myself without them.

331
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,560
I'm sorry, Pip.
I'm being very miserable.

332
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,160
It's a special occasion.

333
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,040
I have something to tell you.

334
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,120
I've kept it to myself,
but I can't any longer.

335
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm in love.

336
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,400
That's very good news!
Does the lady have a name?

337
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,120
Estella. I'm in love with Estella.

338
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,720
Well? Would you not be happy for me?

339
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,240
That house...

340
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,000
Does it not feel haunted to you?
Poisoned, somehow?

341
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,400
If Miss Havisham keeps her
fiance's memory alive,

342
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,360
I don't call that poison,
I call that love.

343
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,640
Compeyson didn't die.

344
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,000
It would have been better if he had.

345
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,080
He was a con man, Pip.

346
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,760
He asked Miss Havisham
to settle money on him.

347
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,680
A great deal of money.

348
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,000
And on the day of the wedding,
he sent her a note.

349
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,240
He was never seen again.

350
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,760
He jilted her.

351
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,040
And a little while after...

352
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,240
it was heard that
she had adopted a little girl.

353
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,640
That day we met, I heard your father
say something about Estella,

354
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,560
that no-one knows who she is?

355
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,960
We were told she was the orphaned
child of friends.

356
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,120
No friends anyone had ever heard of.

357
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,800
Is that why you're not happy for me,
because no-one knows where Estella
is from? I expected better from you.

358
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,040
No, that's not it at all!

359
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,440
Compeyson's betrayal hangs around
Satis House like a curse.

360
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,880
It festers and Miss Havisham
lets it fester.

361
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,920
Estella has grown up with that,

362
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,880
surrounded by its influence
every single day.

363
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,280
You do not know Estella!

364
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
I love her.

365
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,520
When I reach my majority,
we will be married.

366
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Just tread carefully, Pip.
Be cautious.

367
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,280
Everyone is telling me
to be cautious these days.
I am sick of caution.

368
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,120
Quite right, Pip.
Caution is very boring.

369
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,080
Pocket.

370
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,240
Drummle.

371
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,040
You know each other?

372
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,280
We schooled together.
Didn't we, Herbert?

373
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,800
Goodbye.

374
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,480
Dear old Empty Pocket.

375
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,040
I wonder if he didn't cut
himself off from his family

376
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,800
for some girl in order to make
himself the tiniest bit memorable.

377
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,560
Where did you school, Pip?

378
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Privately. At home.

379
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,120
Lucky you.

380
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,280
I appear to be drinking all your
champagne, how fearfully rude of me.

381
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,200
Yes, well, we'll get another.
It would be my pleasure.

382
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
I do like new people.

383
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,200
Mr. Wemmick?

384
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,680
It is not the day
for your allowance.

385
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,960
I know, I wanted to speak to you
on a private matter.

386
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,400
Make an appointment with the clerks
to see Mr. Jaggers.

387
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,400
This isn't something
I'd wish to discuss with Mr. Jaggers.

388
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,880
I thought you'd be more suitable.
No-one more suitable than Jaggers.

389
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,280
If you'd just hear me out. We could
have luncheon at my club. Luncheon?

390
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,960
I'm too busy for luncheon
at your club or anywhere else.

391
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,440
Then I'd be happy to come to
Walworth when you'd have
more leisure to listen...

392
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,680
Make an appointment with the clerks.

393
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,040
Now you'll excuse me,
I have urgent business to conduct.

394
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,080
You really don't like me very much,
do you, Mr. Wemmick?

395
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,040
I don't know who you are.

396
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,560
Down there.

397
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,120
And what will happen to
your property when you are dropped?

398
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,600
Pondering your immortal soul
and how you will explain yourself to
the Almighty, that's all very well,

399
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,320
but these chickens need water,
grain, a coop.

400
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,520
You're condemned but they can be
saved, if you bequeath them to me.

401
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
Yep.

402
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,440
They'll join my flock at Walworth
and be well looked after.

403
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,400
I wish you a good ending.
The ropeman is Noakes.

404
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,760
Ties a strong knot.

405
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,520
What are you doing here?
If I must follow you to Newgate to
have an audience with you, I will.

406
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,560
Did you just take his chickens?
I accepted his bequest.

407
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,000
And he has no further need of them.
What is this matter then?

408
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,520
Herbert still hasn't found
a situation. That is because he
requires capital to buy into a firm.

409
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,240
Capital that Herbert doesn't have.
But I do.

410
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,640
Or I will have.

411
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,680
Mr. Wemmick, I want to use my
expectations to help Herbert

412
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,160
but it has to be completely secret
and I don't know how to go about it.

413
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,960
So I...thought of you.

414
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,320
I would counsel very strongly
against such help being given.

415
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,960
Such dissolution of your portable
property is most ill-advised.

416
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,160
You see these?

417
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,920
You see these?

418
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,400
These are all part
of my portable property

419
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,880
and I do not give one
piece of it away.

420
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,280
Nor should you yours.

421
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,040
This is the advice
of Mr. Wemmick, Jaggers' chief clerk?

422
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,800
It is.

423
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,120
And what does the Mr. Wemmick who
grows his own rhubarb say?

424
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,440
They're a firm of shipping insurers.
Venerable and well respected.

425
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,400
Herbert had written to them some
time ago. That would be perfect.

426
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,400
How will they explain why they're
giving him this opportunity
when he's penniless?

427
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,480
I've thought of that.

428
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,400
Old Mr. Clarriker will tell Herbert
he was touched by his obvious
passion for ships

429
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,440
and wants to support a young man
looking to strike out on his own

430
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,240
without the cushion of family money.
It's a terrible lie.

431
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,280
For a very good cause.
I've rather enjoyed my mission.

432
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,000
The cloak and dagger.
Without the dagger.

433
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,640
The capital required is £500.

434
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,600
Can you pay a portion of that
from what is in my allowance?

435
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,240
I can, but what will you live on?

436
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,320
I am going to inherit a fortune,
Mr. Wemmick. A fortune!

437
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,560
Money is not a concern.
Tell Clarrikers they will receive
the full amount on my majority.

438
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,720
They understand that Herbert
must never know? They're a business.

439
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,480
As long as they get their capital,
they're happy with any conditions.
I shall close the deal.

440
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,200
It seems not everything
in this world is venal.

441
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,560
Mrs. Brandley. My dear.

442
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,600
The whirligig of the season is upon
us once more.

443
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,280
And these are your daughters?
Yes.

444
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,560
Such beauties! Thank you.

445
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
Surely you are not nervous?

446
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,480
I am sick of being looked at.

447
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,840
I am sick of being evaluated.

448
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,720
And the women are the very worst.

449
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,400
None of them can hold
a candle to you, Estella.

450
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,400
May I introduce Mr. Pirrip
and Miss Estella Havisham?

451
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,480
Ladies. Mr. Pirrip.

452
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,520
Miss Havisham, I've called several
times but you are always indisposed.

453
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,840
How have I insulted you?
I don't know what I've done.

454
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,840
You are making
a spectacle of yourself, Sir.

455
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,360
(Did you see that? I did.)

456
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,880
Bidding will be very fierce
this year.

457
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,880
Mr. Pirrip,
you are being much admired.

458
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,200
Do take an interest or their doting
mama will be most offended.

459
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,880
I am flattered by their interest
but I am clearly escorting
another lady.

460
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,360
This is a market, Mr. Pirrip.

461
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,360
All the stock must be assessed.

462
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,600
We are friends.

463
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,520
Indeed?

464
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,920
He is quite the bachelor du jour.

465
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,480
A baronet, will inherit the title
and the estate.

466
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,440
Breeding, bloodlines
and proven provenance.

467
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,800
You said you and Mr. Drummle
were friends. I wonder.

468
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,920
Drummle.

469
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,480
Pip. You've been seeing my tailor.

470
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,840
We could almost be twins.

471
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,080
How charming to see you again,
Miss Havisham.

472
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,600
Excuse me.

473
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,360
I wondered if we might talk later.

474
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,240
We could go to Finches?

475
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,720
Oh, I think we can do better
than Finches.

476
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm going to my other club tonight.

477
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,960
You'll like it there.

478
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,200
We are both gentlemen, are we not?

479
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,760
We are, yes.

480
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,440
Then, speak freely.

481
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,760
There is an understanding between
myself and Miss Estella Havisham.

482
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,640
There has been for some years.

483
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,800
I would not wish for you to become
attached and then be disappointed.

484
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,360
Well, that's very decent of you
to let me know, Pip.

485
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Very decent indeed.

486
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,360
Glad you understand.

487
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,160
Pip.

488
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,520
What sort of a name is Pip?
Who calls a man Pip? Pippety Pip.

489
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
Gentlemen.

490
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,360
Her and her.

491
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,840
You like to spend, don't you?
So, spend.

492
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,600
You can have what you like
and no-one cares.

493
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,920
Whatever your impulses demand.

494
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,320
No?

495
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,720
I shouldn't be here.

496
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,160
Oh, dear. Ladies, it seems
that my friend Pippy is a virgin.

497
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,920
Poor little virgin.
He doesn't know what to do!

498
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,880
Just copy me, Pippy. Isn't that how
you get by? Isn't that how you pass?

499
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,320
By throwing your money around
and copying me, Pippety Pippety Pip?

500
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,160
Stop calling me that.
I know exactly what you are.

501
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,080
You're not one of us.

502
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
You know I know, don't you, Pip?

503
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,760
Who's there?

504
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,160
How well do you know
Bentley Drummle?

505
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,520
You should not
worry about Mr. Drummle.

506
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,960
He will not get
a moment's joy from me.

507
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,640
He is not what he says he is.

508
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,320
None of us are.

509
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,440
Not you.

510
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,240
Not me.

511
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,320
Estella...

512
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,920
Do you remember anything about
your life before Satis House?

513
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,960
I'm not sure.

514
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,560
I know it was you.

515
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,480
I'll never say.

516
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,560
Thank you, Pip.

517
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
You're a good, good friend.

518
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,200
Go and congratulate him.

519
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,840
'Estella, at last!
Why did you not come sooner?'

520
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,680
I've been waiting and waiting. Look!
See, I keep them all.

521
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,760
I read them over and over,

522
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,240
but they're not detailed enough,
Estella.

523
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,160
Can I not at least remove my gloves?

524
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,600
I must hear.

525
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,920
Come. Come. Tell me everything,

526
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,040
I must hear it all.

527
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,600
Get him whatever he wants!

528
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,840
I don't want to read them,
read them to yourself.

529
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,400
That's the least I deserve after all
I've given you.

530
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,480
I've done all you've asked for
and more. Where are you going?
I'm tired. I want to rest.

531
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,480
I've told you everything.
Tell me again!

532
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,120
What did he look like? did he weep?
Tell me!

533
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,320
How can you be so cold?

534
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,400
It's what you trained me to be.

535
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,840
Leave me alone.

536
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,120
No! I will not let you leave me!

537
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
You will not leave me!

538
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,920
Where is Miss Havisham?

539
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,200
She retired early.

540
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,880
There was an argument.

541
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
She wants me to love her.

542
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,920
But I cannot.

543
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,760
Why?

544
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,960
Because I do not have a heart.

545
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,040
That's not true, Estella.

546
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,600
I know it's not true.

547
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,880
'Are you a gentleman yet?'

548
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,520
That is for you to tell me,
Miss Havisham.

549
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,200
You look the part.

550
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,200
You sound the part.

551
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,160
Your good opinion's all that
matters to me, Miss Havisham.

552
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,080
And I reach my majority soon.

553
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,160
The time goes by quickly.

554
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,440
Your destiny approaches.

555
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,600
I will write. As usual.

556
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,360
Tell you of my progress.

557
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,960
So cold.

558
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,560
I am what you designed me to be.

559
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,280
I am your blade.

560
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,560
You cannot now complain
if you also feel the hurt.

561
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,440
Miss Havisham.

562
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:10,000
'My dear Pip.
This is your Uncle Pumblechook,

563
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,120
'making so bold as to convey
with the deepest regrets

564
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,160
'that your sister is dead.'

565
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,240
Sad day, Joe.

566
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,360
I'll wait for you.

567
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,080
She had been sinking fast, Mr. Pip.

568
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,400
In many ways,
it's a blessed relief.

569
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,240
Now Joe can start working again.
The forge has been completely idle.

570
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,440
Is this bespoke, Mr. Pip?
Of course it's bespoke!

571
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,360
It is the quality way now
to only wear bespoke.

572
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,360
What do you mean, working again?
The forge, idle?

573
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,280
He couldn't run the forge and do
everything your dear sister needed.

574
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,120
Not all alone.

575
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,880
You do cut a dash, Mr. Pip.
A dash indeed.

576
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,280
I've arranged the wake.

577
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,480
A lot of people excited to see you.

578
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,160
In the end, I had to ticket
the event, such was the demand.

579
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,280
I can now get a new
pony for the trap.

580
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,840
She was your niece and you charged
people to go to her wake?

581
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,880
It's what she would have wanted.

582
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,400
We shall see you there, Mr. Pip, Sir.

583
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,960
There's boiled ham and a plum duff.

584
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,080
Tried to keep up the house but just
ain't got the touch Missus had.

585
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,360
She was a terror for dust.
Joe, you did everything you could.

586
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,960
No man could have done more.

587
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,400
You'll be wanted at the wake.

588
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,280
I'm not going to that.

589
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,640
Your room's the same from when you
left. I put sheets on the bed.

590
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,760
No, Joe, I can't stay.

591
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,000
I have to go back to London.

592
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,280
I'm taking Estella to a ball.
I...promised.

593
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,360
May I?

594
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,280
You should move swiftly, Mr. Pirrip.

595
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,560
He is most taken with her

596
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,200
and he's very used
to getting what he wants.

597
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,880
Then want must be his master.

598
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,280
Ladies.

599
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,200
Swine-herd? Bird scarer?

600
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,760
To what do you refer?
I'm trying to guess what you did
before you got your money.

601
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,560
Do the voice, Pippety-Pip.
What voice?

602
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,080
The voice you had before you worked
so hard to get this one.

603
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,800
Where are you from, Pippy?
Who are you?

604
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,160
I am a gentleman.
Oh, but you're not.

605
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,320
Any more than she is a lady.

606
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,480
Something about the pair of you
doesn't smell quite right.

607
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,680
But at least
she doesn't curdle the milk.

608
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,200
Shepherd?

609
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,680
Or did you pick stones out
of fields to earn your meagre crust?

610
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,200
Will you take me to my carriage?
I wish to go home. Miss Havisham.

611
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,960
Pip.

612
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,920
Thank you for rescuing me.

613
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,760
I shall have to try
and avoid him in future.

614
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,160
The season will be over
and he will go back to his estate

615
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,000
a married man and you will not
have to see him again.

616
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,280
How do you know?

617
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,200
It is the sort of thing I know.

618
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,080
We shall all be married soon.

619
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,880
Indeed we shall.

620
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,240
I would like to say a few words.

621
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,640
First of all, I would like to thank
Clara's dear Papa

622
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,040
for allowing me to marry
his beloved daughter, finally.

623
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,520
I will treasure her, Sir.

624
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,880
And I would like to thank you,
my friends, for celebrating with us.

625
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,320
And I would like to thank my wife,
for marrying me

626
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,920
and making me
the most blessed man in the world.

627
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,080
And...and I have an announcement.

628
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,760
Clarrikers are opening
a new office in Cairo.

629
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,680
And I've been asked to help
set it up. And I've accepted.

630
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:22,480
So, to friends, to Cairo
and to Mrs. Clara Pocket!

631
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,480
Mrs. Clara Pocket! Thank you.

632
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,040
Good night!

633
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,880
Cairo.

634
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,640
It's not the ends of the earth.
You can visit.

635
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,160
He's very happy, Pip.

636
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,240
As you should be. You come into
your majority tomorrow.

637
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,960
I'll find out
the identity of my benefactor.

638
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,640
You will receive
your portable property.

639
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,440
No more waiting.

640
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,320
Your life will begin in earnest.

641
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,280
Life begins.

642
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,560
Get out! Get out or I'll strike you!

643
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,280
You don't want to do that, Pip.

644
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,440
How do you know my name?

645
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,240
Who are you?

646
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,880
You know me, boy.

647
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,040
Abel Magwitch.

648
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,320
Don't be scared.
I mean you no harm.

649
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,920
What are you doing here?
What do you want from me?

650
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,320
I brought you something.

651
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,920
Something you been waiting on.

652
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,400
What's this?

653
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,080
It's your fortune.

654
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,760
Your fortune what was promised.

655
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,440
It's me that done this for you.

656
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,840
It's me that is your benefactor.

657
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,960
You're my gentleman, Pip.

658
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,120
It's not how I wanted it, Pip.

659
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,400
You should have stayed
in New South Wales.

660
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,120
No, I won't let you do it!

661
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,920
He is a lifer who has
defied the law. He will hang.

662
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,280
You could have been happy.

663
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,400
Oh! Don't touch me.

664
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,520
You know nothing about men,
Miss Havisham.

665
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,440
