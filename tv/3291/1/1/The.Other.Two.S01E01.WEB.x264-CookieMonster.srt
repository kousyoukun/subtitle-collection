你一直想成为一个著名的歌手吗
Did you always want to be a famous singer?

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,750
我以前从没真正唱过歌
I actually never really sang before.

17
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:39,585
我只是为了好玩拍了一段视频
I just made this one video for fun,

18

我们再来一次 但这次
Let's go again, but this time,

31
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:16,422
我觉得屁味越来越大了
I think the fart is just bigger and better.

32
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,924
这样可以吗
Does that make sense?

33
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:19,090
可以
Yeah.

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,527
所以 蔡斯 你才13岁
So, Chase, you're only 13 years old.

35
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:24,763
这么年轻就这么有才华真是不可思议
It's incredible to be so talented at such a young age.

36
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,132
好吧 事实上 凯瑟琳·李
Well, actually, Kathie Lee,

37
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,733
在我们家这是很正常的
that's kind of normal in our family.

38
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:29,135
-哦  -我家大女儿 布鲁克
- Oh. - My oldest, Brooke,

39
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:30,870
当她像蔡斯这么大的时候
was actually a professional dancer

40
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,138
她就已经是一个专业舞者了
when she was Chase's age.

41
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:33,138
厉害
That's big.

42
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:34,441
她现在在做什么
So what's she doing now?

43
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,174
呃.....

55
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,213
布鲁克 你在这里干什么
Brooke, what are you doing up here?

56
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:19,550
我正准备把这间公寓给介绍给这位...
Just getting ready to show this apartment to mister...

57
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,720
Global Biofund, LLC.

58
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:23,687
哦
Oh.

59
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,156
好吧 你得告诉我们
All right, you have to tell us,

60
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:29,593
你是怎么想出蔡斯惴姆斯这么好的名字的
how did you come up with that fantastic name ChaseDreams?

61
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:31,160
-太棒了  -我们很喜欢
- It's great. - We love that.

62
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,429
事实上 我在浴室的一块装饰性
Well, I actually have that phrase

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,199
的石头上就有这句话
on a decorative rock in my bathroom.

64
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:36,633
当然了
Of course you do.

65
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,434
但这也意味着 就像
But it also means, like,

66
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,537
追逐梦想是多么重要
how it's important to chase dreams.

67
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,171
哇 就像 字面上的意思
- Wow. - Wow, like, literally.

68
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,307
我家人教我的
My family taught me that,

69
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:45,876
你要尽可能的使自己的生活跟充实
how you've got to live life to the fullest,

70
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,277
因为你永远不知道这一切什么时候会结束
'cause you never know when it's all gonna be over,

71
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:51,515
所以你要不断努力的追逐梦想
so you've just got to chase dreams.

72
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:58,122
♪ I-I-I'm a winner ♪

Hi. Everything's good? I never left.

77
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,865
嘿 你们看完了吗  我没有离开
Hey, you guys finished? I didn't leave.

78
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,867
卡里
Cary.

79
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:13,602
嘿 维尚 我一直都在这里
Hey, Vishant, been here the whole time.

80
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,270
我要告诉你一件事
I need to tell you something.

81
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,108
你能去叫另一个
Can you go get... the other one?

82
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:21,276
另一个..
The other...

同性恋服务员
gay waiter?

84
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:24,347
当然 可以
Sure, yeah.

85
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:30,020
柯蒂斯
Curtis.

86
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:33,088
天哪 我已经不参与任何事情了
God, I'm already not into whatever this is.

87
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:34,990
-是的  -嗨 维尚
- Yeah. - Hi, Vishant.

88
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,759
我想让你们知道
I wanted you both to know

89
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,561
昨晚在我家
last night at my home

90
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,531
我和妻子看了《断背山》
my wife and I watched "Brokeback Mountain".

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,565
哦 哦
Uh-oh.

92
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,266
虽然不是很喜欢
I didn't like it.

93
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:47,669
但我还是看了
But I watched it.

94
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,705
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

95
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,716

00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:52,675
-噢 谢谢  -谢谢
- Oh, thank you. - Thank you.

97
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:54,544
你是我的盟友
You are an ally.

98
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,944
-我们为你骄傲  -是的
- We'll see you at Pride. - Yes.

99
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,412
-谢谢你 维尚  -尤其那套衣服
- Thank you, Vishant. - Wear that suit.

100
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:59,514
我们喜欢那套衣服和那双笨重的鞋子
We love that suit and those heavy shoes.

101
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,383
噢 我很高兴你回来了
Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm glad you're back.

102
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,651
因为我有重要的事要问
Because I have something important to ask.

103
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,288
-你会在课间时嫁给我吗  -哦 天了噜
- Will you marry me at recess? - Oh, my God.

104
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:08,490
说句公道话 我很为他高兴
For the record, I'm very happy for him.

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,758
我应该相信这句话吗
Mm-hmm, am I supposed to believe that read.

106
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:12,094
我为他感到高兴
I'm very happy for him.

107
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,828
我知道这表情太夸张了
- That's too big of a smile. - Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:14,796
你的试镜怎么样
How was your audition?

109
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,231
还可以吧
Oh, fine.

110
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,367
我是说 我只是. 我真希望.
I mean, I just... I wish...

111
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:20,069
我真希望我现在是在试镜更酷的东西
I wish I was auditioning for cooler stuff by now.

112
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,637
好吧 首先 不要贬低广告 好吗
All right, first of all, don't knock commercials, okay?

113
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,475
我曾经和一个男人约会过 他做了一个Nasonex的广告
I once dated a guy; he did one Nasonex bee commercial.

114
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:28,711
三次约会后 他给我买了这个
And after three dates, he bought me this.

115
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:33,281
噢 我现在已经不戴了 它又大又丑
Oh, I'm not wearing it right now, but it's this big, ugly,

116
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,483
令人作呕的戒指  但我就是喜欢
disgusting ring, and I love it.

117
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,350
好吧 那么到底怎么回事
Great. Well, what went wrong?

118
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,853
哦 他的屁眼里总是
Oh, he always had tiny little balls of toilet paper

119
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:39,855
塞着小小的卫生纸球
stuck in his butt hole.

120
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:41,489
好吧 那..
Okay, that's...

121
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:43,190
哦 那人没在这里工作 夫人
Oh, no one who works here, ma'am.

122
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,774
我们都有很干净的屁眼
We all have very clean butt holes.

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,031

Brooke, what are you doing?

128
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,175
我在伪装
I'm undercover.

129
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:02,543
员工不允许使用健身房
Employees aren't allowed to use the gym.

130
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:05,014
他们同时也不允许呆在空无一人的公寓里
They're also not allowed to squat in empty apartments.

131
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,214
我不得不这么做
I have to.

132
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:09,084

133
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,552
兰斯多性感啊
Lance was so hot.

134
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,920
25岁认识的他  但现在他30岁了
When he was 25, but now he's 30.

135
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:14,988
他还在说 "该死 丹尼尔 "
And he still says, "Damn, Daniel".

136
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:16,723
但他现在不是个鞋匠什么的吗
But isn't he, like, a shoe designer or something now?

137
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:18,660
-这多好啊  -不是
- That's cool. - No.

138
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,829
不 他有鞋子的主意 然后他就画出来了
No, he has ideas for shoes, and then he draws them

你需要尝试一段真正的感情
You need to try being in a real relationship,

316

就像我和兰斯一样

你和兰斯一年都没[哔]
You and Lance didn't [bleep] for a year.

318
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,900

That's just because he dabbed all the time.

319
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,001

393
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:16,293
我今天为鞋子想出了三个新主意
I actually came up with three new ideas for shoes today.

394
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:18,495
一：底部有鞋带
One: laces on the bottom.

395
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:20,730
二：看不见的鞋
Two: shoes but invisible.

396
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,099
三：可食用的鞋子
Three: edible shoes.

397
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,067
等等 抱歉 所以你就穿着鞋子到处走
Wait, I'm sorry, so you just walk around in the shoes

398
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:26,836
然后整天不停地吃鞋
all day and then eat them?

399
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,338
-当然了 如果你饿了的话  -哦 天哪
- Hell yeah if you're hungry. - Oh, my God.

400
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,840
我真希望  说"弱智"是对你的恭维
I wish it was still okay to say "retarded".

401
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:33,676
哦 不 等等 玛玛姬塔 蔡斯惴姆斯爱所有
Ho, no, wait, mamacita, ChaseDream loves all people

of all mental faculties.

403
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,779
-天了噜  -是的 甚至是耶稣
- Jesus Christ. - Yes, even Jesus Christ.

404
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,448
哦 天哪 妈妈 我和兰斯分手了
Oh, my God, Mom, I broke up with Lance.

00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:45,554
-你还好吧  -是的 我很好
- Are you doing okay? - Yes, I'm great.

408
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:47,256
我比以前好多了
I'm way better than I was before.

409
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,024
-无意冒犯 兰斯  -什么
- No offense, Lance. - What?

410
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:50,992
因为我终于明白了
'Cause I finally get to figure out what it is

411
