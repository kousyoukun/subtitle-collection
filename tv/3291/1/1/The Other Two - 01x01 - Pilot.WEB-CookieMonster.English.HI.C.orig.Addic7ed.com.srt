There's a sexy new singer in

He just turned 13.

His homemade music video
"I Wanna Marry U At Recess"

has racked up 22 million views
in just three days.

So walk us through this, okay?

Did you always want to be a
famous singer?

I actually never really sang before.

17

I just made this one video for fun,

and I guess lots of people liked it.

No, mine's dead.

00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:44,044
but you can meet him at dinner tonight.

194
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,487

No, okay, he's initiating this stuff.

Plus, I can feel his boner
through his shorts.

Well, what kind of shorts?

I wanted you to know I saw
another gay film today.

00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:07,259
It had way more sex than
"Brokeback Mountain".

391
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:09,294
But I think I liked it better.

392
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:13,465
It was called "Cody Rides Tristan".

393
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:15,805

What happened?

401
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,450
I just wanted to get his
little body jacked up

- He is?
- Yeah.

00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,859

- That's done.

But we can still celebrate my
children who are here.

413
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:58,275
Because I'm equally proud
of both of you.

so hard at becoming an actor.

- I am an actor now, Mom.

I haven't danced in 12 years.

419

And Lance, America's next top
shoe designer.

Thank you. You know what?

421
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:16,293
I actually came up with three
new ideas for shoes today.

422
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,496
One: laces on the bottom.

423
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:20,731
Two: shoes but invisible.

424
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,100
Three: edible shoes.

425
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,068
Wait, I'm sorry, so you just
walk around in the shoes

426
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:26,837
all day and then eat them?

427
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,339
- Hell yeah if you're hungry.
- Oh, my God.

428

"retarded".

- Are you doing okay?
- Yes, I'm great.

I'm way better than I was before.

437

- No offense, Lance.
- What?

- I'm gonna travel.
- See 'em all.

I'm gonna drive across the country.

- More wine.
- Because, you know,

I'm free to be me, which rhymed.

I'm gonna be a rap, rap critic.

450
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,814
The point is, Mom,
is that I'm rock solid.

451
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:13,749
- We both are.
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:16,185
Cary had a callback today.

453

- Cary.
- Hey.

00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:19,521
Bravo.

455

Go, Care.

00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:22,858
- Yay.
- It's really... it's nothing.

457

It's just... it's a commercial
where I smell a fart.

458
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,132
Yeah, I just... I just go, like...

459
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:36,872
Oh, that was good.

460
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:38,007
It was very natural.

461
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:39,640
Full disclosure: I just
farted moments ago,

462
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,875
so... it's the eggs.

463
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:42,110
I do smell it now.

464
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,879
Anyway, the point is, Mom,
we might not be the hot

new twink or whatever,

466
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,586
but all three of your kids are hot,

468
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:54,655
What? You guys aren't millennials.

469
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:55,924
- Yeah, we are.
- We Googled it.

- BOTH: It's 1982 and after.

Brookie, honey, listen to me.

Okay, both of you, come on,
come on right now.

00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,145
- Ugh.
- I love you both so much.

482
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:21,716
But be careful of the studs,
'cause they're very sharp.

483
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,851
- Love you, Mom.

Love you too.

00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,972
- Oh, Debra.
- Debra, no.

492
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,940
Hey, can I sleep with you guys?

493
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,276
BOTH: Hey.

Yeah.

497
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,882
- I'm still kind of sick, though.
- Yeah.

We heard about all those eggs.

Mom said you got a callback
for a commercial

500
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,790
and it could maybe be on TV?

501
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:05,792
I did. I did, yeah.

502
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,760
That's awesome.

503
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:08,961
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Thanks.

504
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,963
Hey, did you have fun today?

505
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:13,566
It was okay.

506
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,968
Streeter made them put makeup
on my arms.

509
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:20,840
- No.
- No, no, no.

510
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,942
They looked gorgeous.

511
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:26,078
Are you excited to go back to
Ohio tomorrow?

512
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:30,082
Yeah, but can we hang out
again next week?

513
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:32,484
Like, in New York?

514
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,121
Yeah, Streeter says I'm gonna
be out here a lot.

515
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,557
I might do school online.

516
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,860
- Cool.
- Cool.

517
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,428
That's great.

518
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:44,897
Good for you.

Okay, well, I think I'm gonna
go to sleep.
