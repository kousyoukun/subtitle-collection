1
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,133
Much of our planet still remains unexplored...

2
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:54,600
for most of it is covered by water.

3
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:59,025
Every journey below the surface

4
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,205
can reveal something extraordinary.

5
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:07,475
More than a thousand new species

6
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:10,475
are discovered here every year.

7
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:28,580
The ocean is home to eighty percent

8
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:33,002
of all animal life on Planet Earth.

9
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:45,666
But today, thriving in this varied world,

10
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:51,506
sometimes demands the most surprising behaviour.

11
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:14,861
The shallow seas of the tropics.

12
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:21,686
This may look like a paradise...

13
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,705
but beneath the surface,

14
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:31,588
it is an arena for constant life-and-death struggles.

15
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:36,268
Where not everything is quite as it seems.

16
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:48,541
A predatory lion-fish...

17
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:55,412
on the hunt for shrimp and small fish.

18
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,572
With so many places for its prey to hide,

19
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,576
the lion-fish has to be patient...

20
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:21,721
This shrimp appears tempting...

21
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,137
As the lion-fish closes in,

22
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:30,626
it fans out its fins to disorientate its prey.

23
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,961
The hunter becomes the hunted...

24
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,447
tricked by one of the shallow sea's

25
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:57,456
most extraordinary predators.

26
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,280
A clown frog-fish!

27
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:09,910
On its head, it carries a fishing rod -

28
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,361
a modified dorsal fin,

29
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:17,298
baited with a lure, easily be mistaken for a shrimp.

30
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,158
But, when the fish stop biting,

31
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:34,814
it is time to pack the rod away and move on.

32
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:44,018
And for a frog-fish, that takes time...

33
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:59,305
Rather than swim, frog-fish walk!

34
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:05,134
Its fins have in effect become feet...

35
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,307
It may not look pretty,

36
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:20,188
but what appears to be coral living on its skin

37
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,375
is actually camouflage.

38
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,259
As every good angler knows,

39
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:42,971
picking the right spot is important.

40
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:51,455
Jigging the rod sends out pressure waves

41
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:55,224
to attract the attention of possible prey.

42
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:06,427
These dragonets are certainly interested.

43
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,403
Almost there...

44
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:38,379
Hook, line, and sinker...

45
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:51,662
Like all shallow seas,

46
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:55,692
the cold waters off the coast of North America,

47
00:06:56,022 --> 00:07:00,083
benefit from the intensity of the sunshine.

48
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:12,724
Here, that fuels one of the fastest-growing organisms on the planet.

49
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:16,357
Giant kelp.

50
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,654
Towering forests,

51
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:25,747
can eventually reach the height of a twelve-story building.

52
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:43,724
These forests are nurseries for young horn sharks.

53
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:48,742
As the sun begins to set,

54
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:51,537
they leave their daytime shelter

55
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:58,107
and set off into the heart of the kelp forest to find food.

56
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:14,192
Barely half a meter long, this little shark is extremely vulnerable.

57
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:22,568
There are monsters here.

58
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,616
A Giant Sea Bass -

59
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:29,481
weighing over 200 kilograms...

60
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:33,920
And wolf eels,

61
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:39,552
with big teeth that can crush little red sea urchins.

62
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:45,935
But the biggest danger comes from other sharks.

63
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,481
Hound sharks...

64
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,270
and huge Broad-nose Seven-Gills.

65
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:16,700
In this forest, it pays to keep a low profile...

66
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:52,590
An Angel Shark...

67
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:58,857
one of the most deadly sharks in the kelp forest -

68
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,396
and certainly the best camouflaged...

69
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,927
An Angel Shark will lie in wait for days...

70
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:34,357
But this one, has already attracted too much attention.

71
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,091
It is not welcome here.

72
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:52,529
Now the coast is clear.

73
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:04,083
But Angel Sharks hunt around the clock.

74
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:18,037
Openings for breathing, called spiracles,

75
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:22,044
blow out sand that helps to cover its body.

76
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:31,653
The trap is set...

77
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,529
Staying close to the seabed

78
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,748
is a good way to avoid most predators...

79
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:42,294
Faster than the blink of an eye.

80
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,709
But it's not over yet...

81
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,536
Horn Sharks have a secret weapon.

82
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,021
Sharp spikes

83
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,755
keep them very much off the menu for most.

84
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:22,254
So this young Horn Shark

85
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,755
can hunt in safety... for now.

86
00:13:55,944 --> 00:14:01,209
Violent winter storms batter these kelp forests.

87
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:11,740
The plants can be ripped from the sea floor...

88
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:18,107
and carried away far out to sea.

89
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:35,255
The open ocean is a vast, feature-less desert...

90
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:41,607
Even a small piece of drifting kelp

91
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,584
can become valuable.

92
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,310
It is just what these fish have been searching for...

93
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:06,186
Here, shelter where eggs can be laid unobtrusively is rare.

94
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:09,725
So they make the most of it.

95
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:16,281
Each female produces up to a thousand eggs

96
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:19,787
and the males rush in to fertilise them.

97
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:36,100
All this activity attracts the attention of blue sharks.

98
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:41,827
They can travel thousands of miles through the ocean

99
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:43,694
in search of food.

100
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:51,272
And they may not have eaten for weeks...

101
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:55,936
It seems that they are in luck...

102
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:07,913
But these fish are no easy meal...

103
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:16,374
They are flying fish!

104
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:20,443
The blue shark, however, are not here for the fish -

105
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,709
they have come... for the caviar.

106
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,796
But flying fish lay so many eggs,

107
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,749
that the sharks' feasts hardly make an impact...

108
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,897
And in a few months' time,

109
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:02,671
a new generation will take to the skies.

110
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:18,976
Floating islands of weed are always attractive to

111
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:23,725
creatures looking for shelter out in the big blue.

112
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:26,882
But in today's ocean

113
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:30,530
they are being replaced by something else.

114
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,881
Plastic...

115
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,905
Twelve million tons of it

116
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:44,131
end up in the ocean every year.

117
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:52,428
The deadliest kind are discarded fishing lines and nets.

118
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:59,913
Each year, it is likely over half a million animals

119
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:04,764
are ensnared and killed by these 'Ghost nets'.

120
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,460
But some animals are learning

121
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:20,358
how to take advantage of the plastic rafts...

122
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:27,272
and use them for shelter, or even as a home.

123
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:35,382
This male Columbus crab - barely bigger than your thumb nail -

124
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,358
is a castaway.

125
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:42,241
Clinging to his net,

126
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:46,428
he may have been drifting on ocean currents for months.

127
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:51,085
Now fully grown,

128
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:53,631
he needs to find a partner.

129
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,499
But where?

130
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:10,342
Certainly not here - alone on the net.

131
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:22,202
Columbus crabs are not a good swimmers,

132
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:24,897
so this male is marooned.

133
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:37,022
Perhaps a passing loggerhead turtle

134
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:39,749
could be the chance to hitch a lift...

135
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:32,616
Made it!

136
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:38,258
But there's more than one passenger here...

137
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:42,672
A female Columbus crab!

138
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,842
They waste no time in getting acquainted...

139
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,749
and start to mate...

140
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:12,621
This pair may well stay together for the rest of their lives.

141
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:27,074
A turtle, after all, makes an excellent home.

142
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:35,991
In return,

143
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:40,262
the crabs provide an on-board grooming service.

144
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:14,272
Finding a partner in the vast ocean,

145
00:23:14,782 --> 00:23:16,467
is not easy...

146
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,928
Dawn in the Sea of Cortez.

147
00:23:50,656 --> 00:23:53,006
Mobula rays.

148
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,061
They gathering here most likely to breed.

149
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:24,663
No one is sure why they leap,

150
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:29,600
but the loud splashes certainly seem to attract more rays.

151
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:38,585
Other creatures however are also listening.

152
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,171
Orca have heard the splashes...

153
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:18,116
This female specialises in hunting rays.

154
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:28,225
But today, she is teaching two youngsters

155
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:32,608
the finer points of mobula-ray hunting.

156
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:48,811
The rays are fast and can out-manoeuvre an orca.

157
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:58,048
She knows

158
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,374
she needs to herd the prey into a tight group.

159
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:09,828
But she can't do that on her own.

160
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:12,561
It will take teamwork...

161
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:17,108
and that is today's lesson.

162
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:28,632
The young orca are quick to catch on.

163
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:35,623
The rays are surrounded...

164
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:41,702
They dive.

165
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:50,717
Only to be forced back up again by the experienced female.

166
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:59,069
And now, with the exhausted rays trapped against the surface,

167
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:01,523
she attacks...

168
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,022
And the young ones follow her lead.

169
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:30,133
This family are the only orca

170
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:33,068
known to hunt rays like this,

171
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:36,937
and they are lethally efficient.

172
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:46,648
But it appears that school is over for today...

173
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:51,116
For a few battle scarred survivors,

174
00:27:51,117 --> 00:27:53,835
it's a lucky reprieve...

175
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:09,381
With the orca gone, the rays can resume their courtship...

176
00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:21,585
And they do so in astounding numbers.

177
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:34,990
Tens of thousands of rays in a single shoal.

178
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,116
Vast areas of our ocean are yet to be explored,

179
00:28:55,812 --> 00:29:00,647
the least known parts of it are its great depths.

180
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:09,327
Only highly specialised vessels

181
00:29:09,328 --> 00:29:11,108
can take you there.

182
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:21,061
As you descend, the sunlight rapidly fades.

183
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:32,358
Two hundred metres down, you enter the twilight zone...

184
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,920
A alien world

185
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,452
inhabited by creatures beyond imagination.

186
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,640
A siphonophore - with a cloak of lethal stinging tentacles.

187
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:29,967
Siphonophores repeatedly clone themselves

188
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:33,381
and so grow to immense lengths.

189
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,561
This one measures 45 meters

190
00:30:40,562 --> 00:30:44,194
and is the longest animal ever recorded.

191
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,740
With such deadly predators around,

192
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:54,795
creatures here go to great lengths to hide...

193
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,320
A glass squid.

194
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,440
Completely transparent - except for its eyes...

195
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:19,615
and stomach.

196
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,520
So it is extremely difficult to find in the gloom.

197
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,120
Below one thousand meters,

198
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:53,069
all traces of sunlight have disappeared.

199
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,066
This is the midnight zone.

200
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:08,897
Catching food in the perpetual darkness is not easy.

201
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:31,782
The gulper eel.

202
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,120
Its giant, extendable mouth

203
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:45,935
can engulf prey larger than its own body.

204
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,920
Two miles down,

205
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:14,836
you finally reach the Ocean floor.

206
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,225
We know more about

207
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:24,006
the surface of Mars.

208
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,120
The pressure of the water

209
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,392
is three hundred times greater than at the surface...

210
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,743
and it's freezing cold.

211
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,240
Yet amazingly,

212
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:44,734
there are animals living here...

213
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,335
Muusoctopus robustus, nick-named the Pearl Octopus.

214
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:02,002
Breeding, in these extreme conditions

215
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:05,923
poses a particular problem for these animals.

216
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,159
At these low temperatures,

217
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,600
this female's eggs

218
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,342
could take over ten years to develop.

219
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,785
So she travels to a very special place...

220
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,224
This is the largest known gathering of octopus in the world.

221
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:03,139
She joins twenty thousand other females -

222
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:07,944
all here to lay their eggs.

223
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,600
Water, heated deep in the earth's crust,

224
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:21,170
rises through cracks in the seabed.

225
00:35:22,698 --> 00:35:28,248
Raising the temperature to as much as ten degrees Celsius.

226
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:32,665
A deep sea, thermal spa!

227
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,560
This warmth

228
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,760
significantly speeds up the development of their eggs.

229
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:44,607
Even so

230
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:48,168
they will still take nearly two years to hatch.

231
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Once a female is settled,

232
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:55,055
she won't move from her spot...

233
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,923
not even to feed.

234
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:13,798
She will constantly tends to her brood -

235
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,508
keeping them clean...

236
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:21,384
and oxygenating them... with jets of water.

237
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:28,352
Pearl octopus mothers must surely

238
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,243
be amongst the most devoted.

239
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:50,478
After almost two years,

240
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:53,884
the ordeal take its toll.

241
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,329
But the vigil is almost over.

242
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:03,648
The last of the brood

243
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,751
are gently encouraged to leave.

244
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:17,868
But this will be a final act.

245
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,561
Like all the mothers here,

246
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:25,750
this octopus is starved and exhausted.

247
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,458
Her life will soon be over.

248
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:50,950
But this devotion

249
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:53,296
means that her offspring are among

250
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:57,489
the largest and most developed of any octopus -

251
00:38:58,245 --> 00:39:00,841
and have the best chance of survival

252
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:03,653
in the demanding world of the deep.

253
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:21,325
We are finding more

254
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:25,121
of these strange hot springs every year.

255
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:40,165
In some places, they can be astonishingly violent.

256
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:45,302
Super-heated water - hot enough to melt lead -

257
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:48,082
spouts from the sea floor.

258
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:50,931
Dissolved minerals

259
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:54,294
condense around them to form towering chimneys

260
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:57,688
known as hydrothermal vents.

261
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,120
They are home to unique communities of animals

262
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:09,919
that all rely on the nutrients in the scalding water.

263
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:21,911
Some suggest that vents like these

264
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:25,355
could be the places where life on earth first began,

265
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,036
four billion years ago.

266
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:38,368
And there is now evidence of hydrothermal vents

267
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,574
on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn...

268
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Could they too be supporting life?

269
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:55,059
Here on earth, the influence of these vents

270
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:58,196
extends far beyond their chimneys.

271
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,005
The essential nutrients carried in these plumes

272
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:07,891
can rise all the way to the surface two miles above.

273
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:16,000
Here, they stimulate the rapid growth of

274
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,080
tiny marine plants...

275
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,280
on an astronomic scale.

276
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:31,197
This phytoplankton is so abundant,

277
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:35,720
that it produces half of all the oxygen on earth.

278
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:58,321
It is also food for a host of minute animals.

279
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,507
Zooplankton.

280
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:07,390
Together they are the basis of the food-chains

281
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:11,007
that sustain nearly all life in the ocean.

282
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:19,329
In the Pacific waters off South America,

283
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,474
they feed anchovy,

284
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,952
that gather here in billions.

285
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:42,374
This is one of the world's most productive ecosystems.

286
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:58,110
These South American sea lions are on the hunt...

287
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:21,742
But the anchovy shoal has already been located...

288
00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:31,212
by the planet's most efficient hunters.

289
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:39,376
A net over half a mile long encircles the shoal.

290
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,440
It can trap over a million fish.

291
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,920
But the sea lions aren't about to go hungry.

292
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,001
They have learnt to look for holes in the net...

293
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:18,273
Why waste energy?

294
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,001
When food comes to you as easily as this!

295
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:32,272
As more and more sealions arrive,

296
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:35,548
some change their tactics.

297
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,303
They line up on both sides of the net

298
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:49,163
and wait...

299
00:45:04,124 --> 00:45:05,687
As the net tightens,

300
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:09,453
the anchovy panic and rush for the surface...

301
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,932
This is the moment the sealions have been waiting for.

302
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,040
It is such an effective way of hunting

303
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,306
that the sealions here are changing their natural behaviour...

304
00:45:43,565 --> 00:45:46,858
and are raiding the fishing nets...

305
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,473
in their thousands.

306
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,649
With the net almost drawn in,

307
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,110
the fishermen beat out a warning signal.

308
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:08,272
Time is up.

309
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,249
In the confusion

310
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,366
not everyone manages to escape...

311
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:55,195
The trapped sealions are in danger of being drowned.

312
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,259
Pups are separated from their mothers.

313
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:29,242
Then at the last minute, the fishermen briefly drop their net...

314
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:39,633
And the trapped sealions can escape...

315
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:51,399
But many are not so lucky...

316
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,240
Around the world, millions of animals

317
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,857
are accidently caught and die in fishing nets every day.

318
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:07,585
And this 'by-catch' - as it is known -

319
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:11,820
is pushing many species towards extinction.

320
00:49:16,596 --> 00:49:19,790
Animals have evolved in remarkable ways

321
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,871
to the demands of life in the ocean.

322
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,820
But can they now adapt to the new challenge...

323
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,287
living alongside us?

324
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:53,593
The open ocean is home to some of

325
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:57,710
the largest and most extraordinary animals on Earth.

326
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,796
But here, off the Canary Islands,

327
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,726
the Planet Earth team are searching

328
00:50:03,727 --> 00:50:07,727
for one of its smaller, and less familiar, residents.

329
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:10,395
We're looking for a tiny creature called a Columbus crab,

330
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,565
which is only about the size of your thumbnail,

331
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:15,767
which live on floating objects in the open ocean.

332
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:18,701
Columbus crabs were once only found on

333
00:50:18,702 --> 00:50:21,701
natural debris like driftwood or seaweed,

334
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:23,777
but the oceans are changing,

335
00:50:23,778 --> 00:50:25,760
and they have been forced to adapt.

336
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:29,414
The best place to find Columbus crabs

337
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:31,570
is in plastic,

338
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:37,330
because around 90% of the things we see drifting

339
00:50:37,331 --> 00:50:39,315
are plastic.

340
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:42,859
One of the most common items they find

341
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,515
is discarded fishing gear.

342
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:49,539
Over a million tons

343
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,921
is left adrift in the ocean each year.

344
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:55,374
And Columbus crabs

345
00:50:55,375 --> 00:51:00,015
are now making their homes on these unnatural materials.

346
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,353
There's a crab!

347
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:07,867
Surprisingly,

348
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:11,453
Columbus crabs are thriving on this new habitat,

349
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:17,570
but for larger ocean creatures,

350
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:20,234
these nets can be lethal.

351
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,414
Loggerhead sea turtles are especially vulnerable.

352
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,729
Many times they are very injured

353
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,956
and many times they don't even survive -

354
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:39,018
it's a sad situation.

355
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,120
As a rule, wildlife filmmakers

356
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:47,042
observe natural behaviour and do not interfere.

357
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:52,878
But this is far from natural,

358
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:56,823
the team feel they must take action.

359
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:11,903
It seems that the turtle is quite okay.

360
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:14,645
We'll just finish to cut this plastic

361
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:16,809
and then we release it.

362
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:35,246
It's a bittersweet moment,

363
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:38,113
as this is one of eight turtles they rescued

364
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,848
whilst filming here.

365
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,604
This situation is not natural,

366
00:52:43,817 --> 00:52:47,629
it's something that's being caused by human beings.

367
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,920
Sadly, the crew now

368
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:55,561
face dilemmas like this on many of their filming expeditions.

369
00:52:57,994 --> 00:53:02,035
Including, when they travelled to the Pacific coast of Chile,

370
00:53:02,036 --> 00:53:05,114
to show how sealions are competing for food

371
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,934
with one of the biggest fisheries on Earth.

372
00:53:12,698 --> 00:53:15,520
Expedition leader Fernando Olivares

373
00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:17,856
takes the team to the fleet.

374
00:53:24,846 --> 00:53:28,433
Diving near fishing nets is extremely dangerous,

375
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:29,801
so the crew must ensure

376
00:53:29,802 --> 00:53:33,129
they have the full cooperation of the fishermen.

377
00:53:35,072 --> 00:53:38,673
Requesting permission to deploy divers outside the net?

378
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,016
Is that possible?

379
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:45,461
Yes. Be extremely careful.

380
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,650
Thank you very much, Captain.

381
00:53:58,226 --> 00:54:00,423
Pretty hazardous place to dive.

382
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,072
It's just a case of trying to keep an eye on the divers,

383
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,118
but the sealions also like to go down and blow bubbles,

384
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,715
so you'll think you're following the divers

385
00:54:07,716 --> 00:54:09,970
and then a sealion will pop up.

386
00:54:15,924 --> 00:54:20,070
Taking the utmost care, the divers get a close-up view of

387
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,923
the sheer scale of the operation.

388
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,135
This is one net must have about fifteen tonnes of fish in it

389
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:35,150
and there's eight or nine boats in this one little bay,

390
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,807
and these are just the small boats.

391
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:38,408
Out there, there are huge factory ships

392
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,929
that are taking even bigger catches.

393
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,635
How much fish a year from just here?

394
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:48,955
From a million tonnes a year more or less.

395
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:58,768
The catches are so vast,

396
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:02,348
that sea lions have changed their natural behaviour

397
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,327
to collect anchovies directly from the nets.

398
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,320
But it's a risky strategy.

399
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
The crew witnessed

400
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,971
sealions caught in nets multiple times.

401
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:19,846
Woah, it's intense mate,

402
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:21,604
there are so many in there.

403
00:55:27,963 --> 00:55:29,338
There's a pup stuck in the net

404
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:30,424
calling to its mother,

405
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:33,425
and its mother's just on the outside of the net calling back.

406
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:42,596
That's really hard to watch.

407
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,229
Oh, the pup's really panicking now.

408
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,314
Sometimes, fishermen are able to release trapped sealions,

409
00:55:58,587 --> 00:56:00,838
but not this time,

410
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:05,525
the pup is in serious danger.

411
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:11,705
Once again, the crew decide to step in.

412
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:16,931
He's going to go inside of the net to save him!

413
00:56:45,976 --> 00:56:47,838
Nice, really nice.

414
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:52,479
It's a relief this time,

415
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,572
but it highlights

416
00:56:55,573 --> 00:56:59,291
the new realities of filming wildlife

417
00:57:00,098 --> 00:57:02,634
in today's changing ocean.
