1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,730
这里是通往一处自然界奇观的入口
This is the entrance to one of the greatest of natural wonders…

2
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,320
这就是位于越南的韩松洞
Hang Son Doong in Vietnam.

3
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,890
据称 这里是全世界最大的洞穴
It's thought to be the largest cave on Earth.

4
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,500
在地下200多米的深邃洞穴中
Here, two hundred metres underground,

5
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,800
每年只有几个星期
for just a few weeks a year,

6
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,740
阳光可以透过顶部的一个小洞照进洞内
sunbeams cast light through a hole in the cave's roof.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,140
而这些光亮
That is just enough light,

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,990
已经足够植物生长
to enable plants to grow.

9
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,690
当你再向深处探索 又会陷入黑暗之中
But travel deeper and darkness returns,

10
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,240
这是生命很难跨越的极限之地
and you reach the limit of where life can exist.

11
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,260
我们人类通常很难涉足
These most extreme places on our planet

12
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,920
这些地球上的极端环境
are often hard for us to reach.

13
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,950
事实上 韩松洞在不久前才被发现
Indeed, this cave was only recently discovered.

14
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,110
这里有很多令人叹为观止的奇特景象
And it contains many surprises.

15
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,940
比如洞内的穴珠
Cave pearls -

16
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,090
它们最初只是细小的沙粒
once tiny sand grains,

17
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,530
但如今已有网球大小
now spheres the size of tennis balls.

18
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,310
还有巨大的石笋
And giant stalagmites,

19
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,490
由成千上万年来的
formed over centuries

20
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,720
上千亿颗水滴滴落沉积而成
by billions of individual drops of water.

21
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,950
地下河在石灰岩体中
Underground rivers

22
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,360
穿凿出这条巨大的洞穴通道
have carved this great passage through the limestone.

23
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,990
韩松洞全长超过8公里
Over five miles long

24
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,770
内部空间巨大 有些地方甚至可以
and wide enough in places,

25
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,550
容纳一架巨型喷气式飞机
to accommodate a jumbo jet.

26
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,620
然而在洞穴尽头的洞室
And it is here - in the cave's furthest chamber -

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,710
依然能发现生命的迹象
that life can be found.

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,620
韩松洞中半透明的洞穴盲鱼
Translucent cave fish…

29
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,870
和沼虾
and shrimps -

30
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,070
这些物种在数千年的时间里与世隔绝
isolated for millennia -

31
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,650
靠地表丛林中渗透下来的少量营养物质
feeding on little more than the nutrients

32
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,170
顽强生存下来
from the jungle above.

33
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,720
洞穴盲鱼完全看不见东西
The fish are completely blind,

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,440
只能靠触觉探知四周
and find their way about by touch alone.

35
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,900
韩松洞的地下世界
These underground worlds

36
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,570
是生命存活的极端之境
are at the very limit of where life can exist…

37
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,920
而地面之上的极端环境
But above ground, our planet's most extreme conditions

38
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,570
大多出现在极地地区
are found at the poles.

39
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,880
北极地区冬季的气温
Here in the north, winter temperatures

40
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,020
有时可以降到零下50摄氏度
can drop to minus fifty degrees Celsius.

41
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,230
一年中有4个月的时间
For four months of the year,

42
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,300
这里几乎看不到一丝阳光
there is barely a glimmer of sunlight.

43
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,070
可即便在这样的地方
But here too,

44
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,440
生命依然有其生存之道
life finds a way to survive.

45
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,490
这是一群北极狼
A pack of Arctic wolves.

46
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,840
浓密的皮毛
Their dense fur

47
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,940
保护它们度过了长达数月的严寒
has protected them through months of bitter cold.

48
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,760
此刻 阳光终于重回大地
But now the sun is returning

49
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,970
这里是埃尔斯米尔岛
This is Ellesmere Island.

50
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,980
北极狼群必须趁着短暂夏季的到来
The short summer gives the wolves a chance

51
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,390
增强体力
to rebuild their strength.

52
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,600
可北极地区的生活
But here in the Arctic,

53
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,020
从来都不容易
life is never easy.

54
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,140
这个狼群的首领
This pack

55
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,270
是一只经验丰富的雌性北极狼
is led by an experienced female.

56
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,240
如果它不能带领狼群找到食物
If she can't lead them to food,

57
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,460
那么同伴们就可能熬不过下一个寒冬
the coming winter could be their last.

58
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,530
捕食对象散布在辽阔的冰原上
Prey is spread over such a vast area,

59
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,490
狼群必须不停地奔袭
that they must be constantly on the move…

60
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,300
展开搜寻
in search of it.

61
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,260
但是发现目标仅仅是捕猎行动的开始
But finding prey is only the beginning.

62
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,540
这里有一群麝牛
Musk-oxen.

63
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,590
它们的体形几乎是北极狼的5倍
They are five times the size of a wolf.

64
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,280
北极狼与麝牛之间的冲突由来已久
The conflict between wolf and oxen is an ancient one,

65
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,140
可以追溯到冰川时期
and has been waged since the Ice Age.

66
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,150
它们双方都很清楚彼此的攻防策略
Each side knows the other's tactics.

67
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,780
北极狼会尝试孤立体弱或年幼的麝牛
The wolves try to isolate the weak or the young.

68
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,380
一头麝牛幼崽跌绊了一下
A calf stumbles -

69
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,770
北极狼首领立刻逼近
and the pack leader immediately closes in.

70
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,620
此时麝牛群重新聚拢队伍
But the herd regroups,

71
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,010
亮出牛角准备迎敌
horns at the ready.

72
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,730
双方陷入僵局
Stalemate…

73
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,560
但这里不宜久留
but it can only be brief.

74
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,680
这一次
This time,

75
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,560
麝牛群跑到了地势更高的山坡上
the herd race to higher ground.

76
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
当它们来到山脊上
As they reach the top of the ridge,

77
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,720
雄性麝牛转身做好防御准备
the males turn to defend themselves.

78
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,020
双方又陷入了对峙局面
Stalemate - again.

79
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,100
每一次捕猎行动的失败
Every unsuccessful hunt

80
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,830
都会削弱北极狼群的实力
leaves the pack weakened.

81
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
这或许是唾手可得的美餐
This could be an easier meal.

82
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,760
可情况不太对
But something is not right...

83
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,190
这头麝牛是病死的
this musk ox has died from a disease.

84
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,900
随着北极地区的气候变暖
Outbreaks like this are becoming increasingly common

85
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,040
这样的疫情变得越来越常见
as the climate warms across the Arctic.

86
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,640
狼群虽然很饿
Despite their hunger,

87
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
但它们还是决定放弃这具尸体
the pack don't eat this carcass.

88
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,280
又一群麝牛出现了
Another herd…

89
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,640
这是北极狼群的第二次机会
another chance for the pack.

90
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,490
这一次 北极狼冲散了麝牛群
This time, the wolves manage to split the herd,

91
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,730
这或许能提高它们捕获猎物的概率
that may improve their chances.

92
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,230
雌性北极狼首领
The lead female

93
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,490
极力避免麝牛又一次跑上山脊
makes sure that the oxen do not reach the ridge again.

94
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,950
又少了一位防御者
With one less defender,

95
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,210
麝牛群中的幼崽会更加无助
the calf is more vulnerable.

96
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,830
它们终于可以饱餐一顿了
A much-needed meal.

97
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,940
北极狼群必须在夏季结束之前
The wolves must continue to make the most

98
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,020
抓紧时间捕猎
of the remaining weeks of summer.

99
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,060
这样 当北极的寒冬再次到来时
So, when winter returns,

100
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,200
它们才足以熬过
they are ready to endure

101
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,190
这段地球上
some of the harshest conditions

102
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,450
条件最为严酷的时期
that exist on Planet Earth.

103
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,540
在极地地区之外
Such inhospitable extremes

104
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,960
也存在与之类似的极端环境
are not only found at the Poles.

105
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,460
随着海拔的升高
As altitude increases,

106
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,780
高山上的气温会急剧下降
temperatures fall.

107
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,350
这里的动物
Here too,

108
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,160
也要学会充分利用季节变化带来的机遇
animals must make the most of the seasonal change.

109
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,350
尤其是在准备交配的季节
Particularly if you are ready to mate.

110
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,320
在法国的阿尔卑斯山上
A male common frog

111
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,760
一只雄性欧洲林蛙出现了
in the French Alps.

112
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,760
它整个冬天都在冰层之下冬眠
He has spent all winter hibernating under the ice.

113
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,540
现在是时候苏醒了
But now it's time to wake up.

114
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,100
欧洲林蛙是变温动物
Being cold-blooded,

115
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,200
需要靠阳光来提高体温
he needs the sun to warm his body.

116
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,120
但如果保持不动
But once it sets in a few hours time,

117
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,510
它几小时内就会被冻死
he could freeze to death.

118
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,390
所以它必须抓紧时间寻找伴侣
So finding a mate is urgent.

119
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,630
天气很好
The weather is good

120
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,050
它开始在雪地上滑行加速
and he starts to sledge.

121
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,320
而这里不只是它在孤勇奋战
But this is not a one-frog race.

122
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,820
几十只欧洲林蛙涌向一处可供交配的池塘
Dozens are rushing to the breeding pool.

123
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,460
这么多欧洲林蛙出现在坡道上
This many frogs out on the slopes

124
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,240
自然会惹来关注
doesn't go unnoticed.

125
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,720
小心 别掉进洞里
You can't afford any slips.

126
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,120
似乎一切还算顺利
It was all going so well.

127
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,770
成功到达
Made it.

128
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,740
但是所有的雌性已经找到了伴侣
But all the females have already got partners.

129
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,240
只剩一个办法了
There's only one thing for it…

130
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,250
摔跤大战
wrestling.

131
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,810
这次没能如愿
Not this time.

132
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,100
又一只欧洲林蛙姗姗来迟
Another latecomer,

133
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,140
是一只雌性
a female.

134
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,460
它能中意自己吗
Could she be the one?

135
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,700
有些时候 来得早不如来得巧
Sometimes being late can pay off.

136
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,210
雄性欧洲林蛙付出了很多努力
After all his efforts,

137
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,260
它绝不会轻易放过
the male is not going to let this chance

138
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,490
这次难得的机会
slip through his fingers.

139
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,750
这是非洲北部
This is the cedar forest

140
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,860
阿特拉斯山脉的雪松林
of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa.

141
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,850
这些无尾猕猴（又名巴巴里猕猴）
These Barbary macaques

142
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,060
悠闲度过了食物丰富的夏季
enjoyed a summer of plenty,

143
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,270
现在要付出代价了
but now they are paying the price.

144
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,750
冬季要面临刺骨的严寒
Winter here can be brutal.

145
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,060
在一些年份
In some years,

146
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,870
半数以上的无尾猕猴会失去生命
over half the group perish.

147
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,080
不过 在无尾猕猴的族群中
But in this macaque society,

148
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,510
与同伴关系越紧密
the more social the monkey,

149
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,180
生存下去的机会就越大
the more likely it is to survive -

150
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,170
相互依偎 抱团取暖
keeping warm by huddling

151
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,080
是它们重要的生存策略
can make all the difference.

152
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,680
可它们不能整天待在一起
But they can't huddle all day.

153
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,230
有些时候必须分开去觅食
They must, eventually, break apart to feed.

154
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,430
它们分散到各处寻找食物
They spread out, searching for food.

155
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,680
一旦入夜
But each night,

156
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,860
族群又会回到雪松树上抱成一团
the group return to huddle in the cedar trees.

157
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,990
任何一个成员都不希望被排除在外
No one wants to be left out -

158
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,640
尤其是柔弱的幼崽
especially the infants.

159
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,870
可这只无尾猕猴幼崽却和同伴走散了
This baby - somehow - has got separated.

160
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,480
它必须尽快回到伙伴温暖的怀抱中
He must get back to the life-saving warmth of the huddle - and soon.

161
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,610
可落单的幼崽却遇到了阻碍
But there is an obstacle.

162
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,620
一只脾气暴躁的雄性无尾猕猴
A grumpy male

163
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,850
冷漠地推开了它
is giving the baby a rather cold shoulder.

164
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,600
或许它应该轻轻地靠近对方
Maybe a more subtle approach…

165
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,240
雄性无尾猕猴决定独自离开
the male decides to leave.

166
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,950
最终
At last,

167
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,730
落单的幼崽找到一个温暖的怀抱
an enthusiastic reception.

168
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,030
可是离开的雄性无尾猕猴就没那么幸运了
The male has had less luck.

169
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,990
这一夜恐怕会非常难熬
It could be a long night.

170
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,650
拥抱对人类而言或许只是一种情感表达
Huddling might seem a simple expression of affection,

171
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,550
但对这些无尾猕猴来说
but among these macaques,

172
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,930
却是重要的生存方式
it's essential for survival.

173
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,970
而且不只是这里
And not just here.

174
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,850
在8000多公里外的墨西哥丛林中
Five thousand miles away in the forests of Mexico -

175
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,480
数百万只黑脉金斑蝶
Monarch butterflies - in millions -

176
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,310
也在相互依偎求生
also huddle for survival.

177
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
它们为了躲避北美大陆即将到来的冬季
All of them have travelled across North America

178
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,560
不远千里来到这里
to escape the winter that is coming there.

179
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,250
不过在这片海拔3000多米的森林中
This forest, at an altitude of three thousand meters,

180
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,630
也存在一些挑战
might seem to offer little comfort -

181
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,260
有时气温也会降到冰点以下
for temperatures here can drop below freezing -

182
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,080
同样有可能造成黑脉金斑蝶死亡
and that could kill butterflies.

183
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,670
好在这里的树冠
But in fact, a thin layer of warm air,

184
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,620
可以锁住一层薄薄的暖空气
trapped by the tree canopy,

185
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,050
只要树林环境不受打扰
protects them and will do so throughout the winter,

186
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,650
就可以保护它们安然度过冬季
provided that the forest remains undisturbed.

187
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,370
但不可预测的极端天气
Unpredictable extremes of weather, however,

188
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,000
有时会破坏这种微妙的平衡
can disrupt this delicate balance.

189
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,000
大风会把冷空气带入丛林深处
Strong winds can push deep into the forest -

190
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,540
造成气温骤降
chilling the air.

191
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,970
成千上万的黑脉金斑蝶
Hundreds of thousands of butterflies

192
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,190
被狂风吹落树梢
may be blown from the branches.

193
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,170
在一些年份里
In some years,

194
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,200
75%的黑脉金斑蝶
storms kill seventy-five per cent

195
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,300
都会因风暴而丢掉性命
of hibernating monarchs.

196
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,150
这一只侥幸逃过一劫
This one has survived…

197
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,430
但它不能待在地面上
but on the ground,

198
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,720
夜间的霜冻对它同样致命
and night-time frosts are fatal.

199
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,250
要想活命 就必须离开这里
It can't stay here - and live.

200
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,900
气温太低 它根本飞不起来
It is too cold to fly,

201
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,100
可现在必须要回到树枝上
but it must get back into the trees branches somehow.

202
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,330
于是它开始奋力攀爬
So it starts to climb.

203
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,740
这就像人类徒手爬上摩天大楼
It's the equivalent of a human climbing up a skyscraper.

204
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,190
终于安全了
Safety at last.

205
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,020
春回大地
As spring returns,

206
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,770
黑脉金斑蝶从漫长的冬眠中醒来
the monarchs wake from their long slumber.

207
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:26,090
它们即将开始自然界一项了不起的壮举
And now starts one of Earth's greatest natural spectacles.

208
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,120
然而 这场宏大的复苏盛景
But this mass-awakening

209
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,540
然而 这场宏大的复苏盛景
But this mass-awakening

210
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,960
同样面临着巨大的威胁
is under threat.

211
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:09,110
气候变暖造成极端天气频发
The changing climate is creating more extreme weather

212
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,490
风暴的出现越来越频繁
and storms are becoming more frequent.

213
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,340
但至少到目前为止
But for now,

214
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,220
这场自然界的奇迹还在继续
this miracle of nature continues.

215
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,650
火灾
Fire -

216
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,100
它难以预测 破坏力极强
unpredictable and destructive.

217
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,000
这里是南非的凡波斯生态区
This is South Africa's fynbos…

218
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,470
是地球上植物种类最丰富的地区
botanically one of the most diverse habitats on Earth,

219
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,770
拥有8000多种不同的植物
with over eight thousand different plant species.

220
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,380
可每过20年左右
Yet every two decades,

221
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,240
这里就会发生一场大火将植被化为灰烬
fire reduces the vegetation to ashes.

222
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,150
这种火灾似乎破坏力极强
This may seem catastrophic…

223
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,350
可过不了几天
but just days later,

224
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,430
植物又会破土而出
plants burst into life

225
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,260
这里的景观又会焕然一新
and transform the landscape.

226
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
植物的种子和球茎
Seeds and bulbs

227
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,330
都在等待大火带来的机会
have been waiting for this event.

228
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,230
9000万年来 有些植物浴火而生
Ninety million years of evolution alongside fire

229
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,770
已经完全适应了火焰的洗礼
has made some plants so closely adapted

230
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,090
甚至没有浓烟就无法生根发芽
that they can't germinate without the presence of smoke.

231
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,690
引人关注的是
Remarkably,

232
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,720
地球上大约50%的陆地栖息地
around fifty per cent of Planet Earth's terrestrial habitats

233
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,000
都要靠大火来保持健康的环境条件
depend on fire to remain healthy.

234
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,940
澳大利亚北部的热带草原
In northern Australia,

235
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,990
也需要季节性大火来保持空间的开阔
these savannahs need seasonal fires to keep them open

236
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,950
阻止附近的森林扩张
and prevent the spread of the nearby forest.

237
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,040
一种色彩鲜艳的动物
And they are a vital habitat

238
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,670
就生活在这片开阔的草原上
for this colourful resident.

239
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,890
它们就是稀有动物金肩鹦鹉
The rare golden-shouldered parrot.

240
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,320
这只雄性金肩鹦鹉和它的伴侣
He and his lifelong partner

241
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,270
需要在草原上
rely on grassland

242
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,770
寻找食物和筑巢
for both food, and a nest site.

243
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:58,960
像往常一样
As usual,

244
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,520
它们会在白蚁丘中挖洞产卵
they've laid their eggs in a hole in a termite mound

245
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,880
现在已孵化出了4只雏鸟
and now there are four chicks.

246
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,660
白蚁丘厚厚的泥质外壳
The thick mud walls

247
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,450
不仅可以保护雏鸟免受捕食动物的伤害
don't only protect chicks from predators

248
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,270
还能帮它们躲避烈日的炙烤
but insulate them from the heat of the scorching sun.

249
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,120
这几只雏鸟很快就会羽翼丰满
With fledging just days away,

250
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,780
它们的父母都在加班加点地劳作
the parents are working overtime.

251
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,160
它们每天都能采集数千粒种子
They collect thousands of seeds, every day.

252
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,000
但现在 它们也遇到了难题
But they have a problem.

253
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,790
火灾发生的时间越来越不规律
The fire season is becoming more irregular.

254
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,270
如果雏鸟还没有学会飞行
If they are not ready to fly,

255
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,410
必然无处可逃
chicks have no escape.

256
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,070
不过 选择在白蚁丘中筑巢
But choosing to nest in a termite mound

257
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,160
还有个意外的好处
has a surprise benefit -

258
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,250
它们的巢穴可以防火
their home is fireproof.

259
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,400
白蚁丘的外壳就像混凝土墙
Concrete-like walls

260
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,380
雏鸟躲在里面可以安全避开外面的大火
keep chicks safe from the flames outside.

261
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,010
过火的草地变得焦黑
The seeds of fire grass

262
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,730
金肩鹦鹉更容易找到草种
are now easier for the parrots to find on the blackened earth -

263
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,040
这是它们最喜欢的食物
and they are the parrots' favorite food.

264
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,110
所以对成年金肩鹦鹉
So for both adults

265
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,980
和羽翼未丰的雏鸟而言
and their fledgling chicks,

266
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,160
大火也是它们生存的必要条件
fires are essential for survival.

267
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,390
不过 它们居住的这片草原
But their grassland home

268
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,620
面积正在逐渐缩小
is shrinking,

269
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,710
目前全球的金肩鹦鹉数量
and only about a thousand of these lovely parrots

270
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,440
仅剩1000只左右
still survive.

271
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,170
当地人积极管理草原火情
It's through the active management of fire by humans,

272
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,760
帮它们保住了这片仅存的小天地
that their world now exists at all.

273
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,020
人类活动对全球各地的自然栖息地
Humans are affecting habitats across Planet Earth -

274
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,270
都产生了显著影响
for wildlife, all too often,

275
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,690
而且往往会给野生动物带来灾难性的后果
the consequences have been disastrous.

276
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,020
非洲象是承受能力最强的动物之一
Elephants are among the most tolerant of animals.

277
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,450
它们的寿命很长
They are very long-lived

278
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,450
生存知识可以世代相传
and knowledge passed between generations

279
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:15,110
帮助后代在面临极端环境威胁时
enables them to find food and little-used sources of water

280
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,170
找到食物和稀有的水源
in times of great environmental stress.

281
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,780
但是现在 连非洲象的生存策略
But even among elephants, survival strategies

282
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,820
也显得有些无能为力
are now beginning to fail.

283
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,830
在肯尼亚的安波塞利国家公园
In Amboseli, Kenya,

284
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,370
多年的极端天气
years of extreme weather

285
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,560
和当地牧民的过度放牧
combined with overgrazing by domestic cattle

286
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,840
几乎将这片草原变成了荒漠
are turning these grasslands to dust.

287
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,200
这头雌性非洲象首领已经40多岁了
This matriarch is over forty years old -

288
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,750
它经历过非洲东部最严重的干旱
and she has already survived

289
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,790
并顺利渡过了难关
some of East Africa's worst droughts.

290
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,030
可今年
But this year,

291
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,290
植物数量急剧减少
food is in extremely short supply -

292
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,320
它和幼崽很难找到足够的食物
and her family are struggling to find enough.

293
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,570
它最年幼的一头雄性幼崽
Her youngest son

294
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,170
已经出现营养不良
is malnourished

295
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,380
身体越来越虚弱
and weak.

296
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,680
它有些跟不上妈妈和哥哥的脚步了
And is lagging behind his mother and brother.

297
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,890
雌性非洲象带着幼崽们
She leads them

298
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,480
来到自己熟悉的一片金合欢树林
to a pocket of acacia forest that she knows well.

299
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,390
可断裂的树枝和倾倒的树木说明
But broken branches and fallen trees show that

300
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,200
别的大象已经来过这个地方
other elephants have already been here.

301
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,520
这里没剩下多少能吃的东西了
There is very little left worth eating.

302
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,450
没有食物
Without food,

303
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,510
雌性非洲象无法分泌出足够的奶水
his mother cannot produce enough milk.

304
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,830
它别无选择
She has no choice…

305
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,070
只能离开越来越虚弱的幼崽
but to leave her weakening calf -

306
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,640
到别处去寻找食物
and try to find food elsewhere.

307
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,240
于是雌性非洲象
So she

308
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,730
和它年长的雄性幼崽出发了
and her elder son head off…

309
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,840
虚弱的幼崽被丢下了
without him.

310
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,120
它只能期盼妈妈和哥哥赶快回来
He can only hope for their return.

311
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,800
可是它的时间已经不多了
But for him, time has run out.

312
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,650
雌性非洲象和其它同伴已经无计可施
There is nothing his mother or anybody,

313
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,250
根本救不了它
could have done to save him.

314
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,870
对雌性非洲象来说 只要年长的幼崽还活着
With her elder son still alive,

315
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,560
它的族群就有希望
there is hope for her family.

316
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,950
但它们必须尽快适应环境的变化
But only if they can adapt quickly.

317
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,880
有些族群展现出强大的韧性
Some families are proving to be resilient -

318
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,910
它们会离开安波塞利国家公园
they're travelling long distances away from Amboseli -

319
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,090
到更远的地方寻找新的食物和水源
and finding new sources of food and water.

320
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,260
虽然干旱仍在继续
And despite the drought,

321
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,910
但还是有新的幼崽出生
calves are being born.

322
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,870
然而环境变化的节奏太快
But given the pace of change

323
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,650
非洲象面临着严峻的考验
and the challenges they face,

324
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,960
最终能有多少非洲象适应这种变化
how many of Africa's elephants will be able to adapt -

325
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,200
而且适应速度足够快呢
and can they do so fast enough?

326
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,880
辽阔的戈壁沙漠
The Gobi Desert -

327
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:19,100
这里有无尽的黄沙和皑皑白雪
a land of sand and snow.

328
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,350
至少100万年来
For at least a million years

329
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,840
这里一直是地球上环境最为恶劣的区域之一
this has been one of the most extrme habitats on Earth.

330
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,680
但沙地上的足迹说明
Yet footprints in the sand reveal

331
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,130
这里依然有生命存在
that there is life here.

332
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:53,470
雪豹总是显得行踪诡秘
A snow leopard, seldom seen,

333
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,750
在这样炎热 干燥的环境中更是难得一见
especially in such hot, arid conditions.

334
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,860
它们的生活区域可以延伸到海拔2000米
They live up to two thousand meters above sea level,

335
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,570
领地范围广阔
and patrol vast territories.

336
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,270
雪豹很少会被发现与同类待在一起
They are rarely seen together.

337
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,440
这是一只雌性雪豹
A mother

338
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,560
和它的幼崽们
with cubs -

339
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,810
这是我们第一次拍摄到
filmed here for the first time

340
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,890
雪豹与幼崽相处的亲密画面
in such intimate detail…

341
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,070
这让我们有机会了解雪豹家族的
and they give us a glimpse of their family life -

342
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,210
生活细节
such as it is.

343
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,010
雪豹幼崽与妈妈一起生活的时间
Snow leopard cubs stay with their mothers

344
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:45,000
比其它大型猫科动物都要长
longer than those of almost any other big cat.

345
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,270
它们要花费两年多的时间
They remain together for over two years…

346
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,130
向妈妈学习如何应对极端环境带来的挑战
as they learn how to master the extremes.

347
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,270
雪豹凭借杰出的适应性
Which they do so well,

348
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:17,920
可以生活在地球上最炎热 最寒冷
that they are able to thrive in some of the hottest, coldest,

349
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,380
以及海拔最高的区域
and highest places on Earth.

350
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,970
一些动物经过几百万年的演化
Some animals - over millions of years -

351
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:40,600
已经学会了很多种极端环境中的生存技巧
have evolved ways of surviving extremely hostile conditions.

352
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,580
但随着“极端”环境的进一步恶化
But as the 'extremes' become more extreme;

353
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,590
它们演化的过程似乎显得有些跟不上节奏了
evolution is being outpaced.

354
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,860
这些异常恶劣的环境
These extraordinary places

355
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,700
如今依然是地球上
are still inhabited by some of Earth's

356
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,510
很多适应力最强的生物的家园
most resilient and adaptable species.

357
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,110
但在快速变化的全球环境中
But in our rapidly changing world,

358
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,020
也许我们未来再无法欣赏到
this is Planet Earth

359
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,020
这样壮美的《地球脉动》
as you may never see it again.

360
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:47,470
地球上最极端的恶劣环境
The most extreme parts of our planet

361
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,540
有时也会出现在意想不到的地方
are not always found where you might expect.

362
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,740
在越南的丛林深处
Hidden deep in the forests of Vietnam…

363
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,250
当地居民何卿
a local man, Mr Ho Khanh,

364
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,650
发现了一处令人震惊的奇观
made an extraordinary discovery.

365
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,990
有一天下午下雨
One rainy afternoon

366
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,390
我在一个开阔的山洞里躲雨
I sheltered in a cave opening.

367
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:14,370
我发现突然从洞里升腾起了雾
I saw mist rising from the inside.

368
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,920
它与其它山洞很不一样
It was different from the other caves.

369
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,230
何卿当时并不知道
He didn't know it at the time,

370
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,190
他偶然发现的这处山洞
but he had stumbled upon arguably

371
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,450
可能是全球规模最大的地下洞穴
the largest cave in the world.

372
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,920
我非常骄傲而且很荣幸
It's a source of pride and honour

373
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,390
有机会向世界展示这样宏伟的洞穴
to show the world such a magnificent cave.

374
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,320
《地球脉动》摄制组对这次发现很感兴趣
Inspired by Mr Ho Khanh's discovery,

375
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,560
于是决定到韩松洞进行拍摄
the Planet Earth team set out to film Hang Son Doong…

376
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,190
但首先团队必须到达那里
but first they have to get there.

377
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,350
我们已经离开河谷
We've left the river valley

378
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,220
要逆流而上寻找洞口
and we're walking uphill now to the entrance,

379
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,320
这是一片非常茂密的森林
it's just a thick thick forest.

380
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,340
摄制组在森林中艰难跋涉了两天
After trekking for two gruelling days,

381
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,590
终于找到了这处山洞
the team finally arrive.

382
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:10,120
下面就是韩松洞的入口
Down here is the entrance to Hang Son Doong.

383
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,950
这个狭小的洞口在密林深处
This tiny opening in this massive jungle.

384
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,980
难以想象居然有人能找到这个地方
It's amazing that anyone ever found this place.

385
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,800
我们要在洞中拍摄18天
We're about to go for the next 18 days,

386
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,090
整个过程都需要照明
and it's lights on from here on out.

387
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,220
当地专家带领摄制组走进了黑暗的洞穴
Local experts guide the team through the darkness.

388
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,470
好的 我可以出发了
Okay. I can go.

389
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,050
我没事 我很好
I'm good, I'm okay.

390
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,920
只是地上很滑
It's just really slippery.

391
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,650
摄制组借助复杂的绳索网络
A complex system of ropes leads them down

392
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,750
完成了90多米的下降
a ninety-metre descent.

393
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,990
小心碰头
Watch your head!

394
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,400
好的 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

395
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,960
在岩石之间攀爬了4个小时之后
After four hours clambering over rocks,

396
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:14,150
他们终于来到了宿营地点
they finally reach what will be their camp.

397
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,000
摄制组迎来新的一天
The team wake to a new day…

398
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,950
不过周围仍然一片黑暗
but in darkness.

399
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,360
你睡得怎么样 卢克
How did you sleep, Luke?

400
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,020
很累
Quite tired.

401
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,820
后面就是我们温暖的帐篷
These are our lovely tents behind me.

402
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,820
大家可以看到 里面非常舒适
You can see, they're pretty, pretty snug.

403
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,470
我们每天就在这里吃早餐
This is where we have our breakfast every day,

404
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,240
有人负责烹饪
made by some amazing cooks.

405
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,060
这里是我们的充电站
This is our charging station,

406
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,830
有摄影设备的电池
batteries for camera equipment,

407
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,720
照明设备的电池 头灯
batteries for our lights, head torches,

408
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,180
这可是重要的工具
which is so important.

409
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,170
这是我们的水站
This is our water station.

410
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:00,010
所有这些装备都是靠人力运进来的
Everything that we have got has been brought in by someone,

411
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,290
所以我们不能洗澡 也不能洗漱
so you can't shower or wash.

412
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,870
不只是水
And it's not just water…

413
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,340
总重达到数吨的设备都要靠人力
tonnes of equipment has had to be carried into the cave -

414
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,900
一点一点地搬进山洞
every inch of the way.

415
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,480
摄制组在明亮的灯光下
Now deep underground,

416
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:21,510
终于体会到了洞穴的巨大和空旷
the powerful lights reveal just how vast this cavern is.

417
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,640
真是不可思议
That is amazing.

418
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,880
太大了
It's huge!

419
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,830
每打开一盏灯
As you turn on each of the lights

420
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:34,930
就会看到洞内的又一部分空间
another part of this enormous chamber is revealed.

421
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,280
太神奇了 难以置信
It's magic, absolute magic.

422
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,720
为了拍摄出洞内空间的真实效果
To try and capture the true scale,

423
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,190
摄制组打算尝试一种全新的拍摄手法
the team attempt to filming technique never tried before.

424
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,290
我们打算用无人机玩一点花样
We're trying to do a little bit of a dance with the drones

425
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:59,620
让两架无人机一上一下飞行
whereby we have one drone sort of slightly below the other,

426
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,670
一架负责拍摄
one filming

427
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,070
另一架负责洞内的照明
the other one lighting a feature in the cave…

428
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,530
这里空间狭小
it's a really tight space,

429
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,530
又什么都看不见
you can't see anything,

430
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,660
不知道会出什么差错
what could go wrong.

431
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,230
好 慢一点
OK, slow down a bit.

432
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,420
大家此时都非常紧张
It's making everyone a little nervous.

433
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,540
别再往上了 卢克
Don't go up any higher, Luke.

434
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,140
好 这个高度可以
OK, that's a nice height.

435
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,450
一架无人机负责照明 另一架负责拍摄
With one drone lighting and one drone filming,

436
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,700
于是摄制组发现了
they reveal the wonder

437
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,790
世界上最壮观的石笋奇观
of some of the world's largest stalagmites.

438
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,980
日子一天天过去
As the days pass,

439
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:57,040
摄制组慢慢适应了地下洞穴里的生活
the team settle into the everyday routine of life underground.

440
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,260
这是一段无缘公共设施的生活
This is the epitome of being off grid.

441
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,940
我们把那个叫作“跷跷板马桶”
We call that one see saw loo,

442
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,800
因为它架在一块岩石上
because it's kind of on a rock

443
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,150
每次坐上去如果往后靠
and every time you sit on it and lean back

444
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:12,960
都会担心可能发生意外
you're scared that there's going to be a disaster.

445
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,920
最奇特的感受是
The strangest thing is

446
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,250
我们与外界完全失去了联系
having no connection to the outside world whatsoever.

447
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,760
时间仿佛扭曲了
Time is warped,

448
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,810
在地下 一切似乎都失去了意义
nothing makes sense underground.

449
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,720
开灯 开灯
Lights on! Lights on!

450
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,710
没有阳光的指引
Without daylight to guide them,

451
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,400
摄制组没日没夜地工作
the team work round the clock

452
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,620
努力捕捉洞内独特的景色
to capture the cave's most unique features.

453
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,890
其中最为特别的一处景致
Most special of all,

454
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,050
在每年只出现几周时间
an event which happens only a few weeks a year.

455
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,840
要想到达目的地
To get there

456
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,550
摄制组必须穿过布满怪石的通道
they must navigate through boulder fields

457
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,550
和狭窄的地缝
and tight squeezes.

458
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,120
此处的洞穴顶部
Here, around half a million years ago,

459
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,180
大概在50万年前发生过坍塌
the cave roof collapsed,

460
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,820
打开了一扇通往外界的窗口
opening a window to the outside world.

461
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:15,630
摄制组耐心等待适当的时机
The team wait for just the right conditions.

462
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,140
我们已经在这里待了好几个小时
We've been sat here for hours

463
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,840
最后在右手边的洞壁上
and finally just on the right-hand side of the wall

464
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,030
我们终于看到了一线阳光
you can see the first signs of light.

465
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,170
在黑暗中生活了几周之后
After weeks of darkness,

466
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,750
他们在200多米深的地下
two-hundred metres underground,

467
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:38,050
见到了照到洞穴地面上的阳光
they see sunlight illuminate the cave floor.

468
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,930
阳光照亮了巨大的洞穴
The way it just lights up this massive cave.

469
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:51,720
我们之前打开了四五盏灯
When we've been trying to do it with about four or five lights

470
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,390
但只能照亮一小块地方
and barely even lighting the smallest section,

471
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,540
可阳光照进来的时候
when the sun comes in

472
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,830
周围一下子就亮了
it just phorrrr.

473
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,270
我想大家肯定都起了鸡皮疙瘩
I think everyone's got goosebumps.

474
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,280
我以前从来没有像现在这样崇拜阳光
I don't think I've ever appreciated sun so much in my life.

475
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,520
太不可思议了
It's incredible.

476
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,730
快看阳光中的这条瀑布
Look at the backlit waterfalls,

477
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,050
水滴飘落而下
so slow coming down.

478
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,870
这是我平生见过最美的景色
Literally one of the best things I've ever seen.

479
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,300
对摄制组而言
For the crew,

480
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:36,040
阳光的出现意味着他们的洞穴生活就要结束了
the sunbeam marks a profound end to their time in the cave.

481
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,100
我们出来了
We're outside!

482
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,840
到处绿意盎然 阳光明媚
It's so green, it's so bright.

483
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,520
终于回到地面上了
Being back above ground

484
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,490
感觉像是回家了
feels like where we belong.

485
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,560
令人不禁赞叹的是
It's a wonder to imagine

486
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,950
我们神奇地球的地下
what other extremes still lie

487
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,950
还会隐藏着怎样的极端之境
beneath the surface of Planet Earth.
