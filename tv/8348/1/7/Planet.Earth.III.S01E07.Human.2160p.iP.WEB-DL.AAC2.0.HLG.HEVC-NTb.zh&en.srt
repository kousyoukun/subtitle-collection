1
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,600
这里是尼泊尔的索拉哈
Sauraha, Nepal.

2
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,730
这头印度犀并没有迷路
This rhino is not lost.

3
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,520
它是要去寻找食物
He is on his way to find food.

4
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,590
它必须穿过一个新出现的陌生世界
To get it, he must travel through a new

5
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,390
才能到达目的地
and alien world.

6
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,890
这头印度犀在它的一生中
This rhino, in his lifetime,

7
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,550
经历了先辈们无法想象的巨大变化
has seen more changes than any of his previous generations.

8
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,990
现在 全球各地的各类动物
Across the globe, animals of all kinds

9
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,990
都需要应对一个新的优势物种
are now contending with one newly dominant species –

10
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,960
我们人类
us.

11
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,990
和其它野生动物一样
Like so many wild creatures

12
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,830
印度犀也要学会适应人类社会
he's had to learn how to live in the human world.

13
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
有些动物改变了自己的行为模式
Some animals have changed their behaviour

14
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,090
学着利用人类社会的各种便利条件
to make the most out of living amongst us.

15
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,750
这些食蟹猕猴生活在巴厘岛
These long tailed macaques live in Bali.

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
人类游客的频繁造访
They have developed new interests,

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,390
促使它们养成了新的喜好
brought by human visitors.

18
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,560
每天早上
Every morning,

19
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,080
食蟹猕猴都会成群结队地
the troop heads for a building

20
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,520
前往领地中央的一座建筑
in the centre of their territory.

21
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,270
乌鲁瓦图神庙
Uluwatu temple.

22
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,230
这里每天都有大批游客前来参观
Tourists come here every day, in crowds.

23
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,010
整个神庙里到处都是机会
So the temple grounds are full of opportunities,

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,980
只要你知道去哪里寻找
if you know where to look.

25
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,470
这里有取之不尽的帽子
There is a constant supply of hats

26
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,040
和太阳镜
and sunglasses.

27
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,140
只要你掌握了突袭的技巧
And if you've mastered the element of surprise…

28
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,480
就可以轻松得手
it's easy to get them.

29
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,710
不过 它们不会把这些东西当作食物
But this harvest is not for eating,

30
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,520
而是为了交易
it's for bargaining.

31
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,900
买卖似乎很公平
Seems like a fair trade.

32
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,350
不过有些东西能换到更多的好处
But there are greater rewards to be had…

33
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,320
只有少数成员知道如何获取
for those who know how to get them.

34
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,110
这只年长的雄性食蟹猕猴似乎
And this old male appears to be doing…

35
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,750
深谙其道
very well.

36
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,420
它和族群中的其它长辈一样
He, and the other elders in this troop

37
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,580
有着丰富的经验
have both experience

38
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,540
和知识
and knowledge.

39
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,760
它们已经在这座神庙生活了10多年
They've been working the temple for over ten years

40
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,020
现在眼里只有那些重要的东西
and now concentrate on the big stuff.

41
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,220
盯着那些人类不可或缺的物品
Things that human beings just can't do without.

42
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,490
谁也不想光着一只脚走回家
No one wants to walk home with just one shoe.

43
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,660
而且这些家伙
And these old boys

44
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,150
已经迫不及待地将爪子伸向了尖端科技
can't wait to get their hands on the latest tech.

45
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,060
谁干的
Who's done that?

46
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,360
它们现在已经明白
They've worked out

47
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,190
人类不能没有手中的手机
that we simply can't survive without our phones…

48
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,820
还有钱包
or our wallets.

49
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,540
这些食蟹猕猴的雄性长辈还掌握了一些
The older males understand something

50
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,180
年轻后辈尚需要学习的知识
the youngsters have yet to learn.

51
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,230
那就是谈判的艺术
The art of the deal.

52
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,130
一根香蕉
A banana…

53
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,410
你好大的胆子
how dare you.

54
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,470
一块巧克力
A bar of chocolate,

55
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,030
这还差不多
that's better.

56
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,950
真正的技术蕴含在谈判的过程中
The real skill is in the negotiations.

57
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,510
食蟹猕猴这叫“以人之道 还治其身”
The macaques are playing us at our own game.

58
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,480
它们想要什么
They demand

59
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,850
就要什么
whatever they want.

60
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,680
人类的生活空间
Humanity has spread

61
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,430
已经扩展到世界的每个角落
to every corner of the globe.

62
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,150
我们已经成为影响自然界的强大力量
We have become a force of nature.

63
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,150
人类改变了80%的陆地面貌
We have altered 80% of the land's surface.

64
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,080
地球上的人口已经超过80亿
Eight billion people now live on this planet,

65
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,900
我们正在迅速改变周围的环境
and we are changing the world around us at such speed

66
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,820
对动物来说
that for animals

67
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,980
要跟上这种速度是极大的挑战
the challenge is to keep up.

68
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,870
这里是纽约市
New York City.

69
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,580
一群蚂蚁在活动
Ants.

70
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,660
专家认为
This particular species

71
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,290
这种独特的蚂蚁
is thought to have arrived here

72
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,510
是跟随欧洲第一批移民来到北美洲的
with the first European settlers.

73
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,100
现在 它们被称为铺道蚁
They are now known as pavement ants

74
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,060
在北美洲遍布人类生活的大小城镇之中
because they live almost exclusively our towns and cities.

75
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,310
铺道蚁数量的不断增加归因于食物垃圾
And they're thriving because of junk food.

76
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,200
百老汇大道上就有很多
And here on Broadway Avenue, there's a lot of it.

77
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,720
这是所有铺道蚁都想得到的口粮
This is what every pavement ant desires.

78
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,630
为了达到目的
And to get it

79
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,080
铺道蚁必须借助城市中
the ants use the cities thousands of miles

80
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,190
数千公里的地下通道
of underground tunnels.

81
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,990
侦察兵逐渐靠近目标
This scout is closing in on its target.

82
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,780
可使用人行道的另一种动物
But the animals with which they share the pavement

83
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,940
体重是它们的4000万倍
are forty million times their weight.

84
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,500
所以它们最好还是躲进缝隙里
So it's best to stay in the cracks.

85
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,210
运气真好
Jackpot…

86
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,260
一座肉山
a meat mountain.

87
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,220
但只身行动的铺道蚁
This is too big a job

88
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,050
无法完成如此艰巨的搬运任务
for just one ant.

89
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,950
与所有蚁群的工蚁一样
This worker is female

90
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,790
这只铺道蚁也是雌性
as they are in all ant colonies

91
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,140
它会在沿途留下信息素标记
and she leaves a trail of pheromones to mark a path.

92
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,740
在返回蚁巢的途中
She communicates with every sister she meets

93
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,920
它会把消息告诉遇到的每个姐妹
as she returns to the nest

94
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,390
于是信息很快传播开来
and news on the street spreads fast.

95
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,960
这块经过多次加工的肉
This ultra-processed meat

96
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,120
与它们原本的食物有很大的差别
is very different from their original food.

97
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,260
而铺道蚁强大的消化系统
But their digestive system

98
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,450
是它们成功的关键
is the key to their success.

99
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,890
它们可以快速适应
It's able to keep up with the way

100
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,980
人类不断变化的饮食习惯
humans constantly change their diet.

101
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,930
现如今 铺道蚁的大部分食物
Nowadays, the vast majority of what they eat

102
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,290
都是人类的加工食品
comes from human food.

103
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,490
仅在百老汇一条大街
On Broadway alone

104
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,030
铺道蚁每年吃掉的食物
pavement ants eat the equivalent of a staggering

105
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,600
几乎相当于60000个热狗
60,000 hotdogs every year.

106
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,000
一个热狗的热量
The calories in a single hotdog

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,360
可以保障整个蚁群一个月的能量所需
could fuel the growth of the entire ant colony for a month,

108
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,880
只不过它们先要保证能把热狗搬回家
if only they can get it back to the nests.

109
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,370
但因为行进缓慢
But this slow work

110
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,680
它们很容易吃亏
makes them vulnerable.

111
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,740
铺道蚁并不是唯一偏爱快餐的动物
They aren't the only ones partial to fast food.

112
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,220
要想获得食物就要争分夺秒
It's a race to get their prize home.

113
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,440
或许会有些许损失
There may be losses,

114
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,500
但铺道蚁种群得以不断壮大
but the colony as a whole will now thrive.

115
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,420
事实上 现在纽约市铺道蚁的数量
In fact, pavement ants are so successful here

116
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,020
已经达到了当地人口数量的1000倍
that they outnumber human New Yorkers 1000 to one.

117
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,960
但如果你恶名在外
But success in the human world

118
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,160
想要融入人类社会
can be harder to achieve

119
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,980
恐怕就没那么容易了
if your reputation precedes you.

120
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,260
这条身在印度的孟加拉眼镜蛇
Here, in India this cobra

121
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,150
正朝一座村庄爬去
is heading directly for a village.

122
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,130
它已经闻到了猎物的气味
It has detected the scent of prey.

123
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,230
这条孟加拉眼镜蛇身长大约两米
Nearly two meters long,

124
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,950
毒牙单次释放的毒液可以杀死10个人
it has enough venom in a single bite to kill ten people.

125
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,540
仅在印度 蛇类咬伤每年就会造成
Snake bites are responsible for nearly 60,000 deaths a year

126
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,730
近60000人死亡
in India alone.

127
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,200
它们爬行时悄然无声
They travel so silently

128
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,670
所以普通人很难察觉有蛇类靠近
that their presence is often undetected.

129
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,490
而它们捕猎时
And when they're hunting

130
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,210
可能会出现在任何一个角落
there's no place they won't go.

131
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,000
是一只蟾蜍
A toad.

132
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,470
孟加拉眼镜蛇能通过收吐分叉的舌头
Each tip of its forked tongue

133
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,350
收集猎物散发出的化学信号
collects chemical signals from the prey

134
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,630
确定目标的大致方位
and helps to reveal its position.

135
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,810
等靠近之后
But up close,

136
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,860
眼镜蛇就需要根据
the snake relies on movement

137
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,590
猎物的移动来准确定位
to precisely locate its prey.

138
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,950
蟾蜍必须谨慎选择逃跑的时机
The toad must pick its moment to escape.

139
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,960
蟾蜍每次碰触地面
Every time it touches the ground

140
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,790
都会留下气味痕迹
the toad leaves behind a scent.

141
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,230
它可以藏起来
It can hide

142
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
但眼镜蛇依然会循着线索逼近
but the trail will lead the snake to it.

143
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,480
这里不仅是孟加拉眼镜蛇的猎场
These cobras don't just hunt here,

144
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,050
也是它们生活的地方
they live here.

145
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,530
印度村庄
They have found a home

146
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,920
给孟加拉眼镜蛇提供了栖息之所
where the Hindu villagers revere them

147
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,100
当地村民会对它们敬若神明
and consider them to be demi-gods.

148
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,010
令人称奇的是
Remarkably,

149
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,750
科学家们认为村民的宽容
scientists believe that this tolerance

150
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,200
促使眼镜蛇的行为发生了变化
has led to a change in the snake's behaviour.

151
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,550
它们放缓了爬行速度
They move more slowly

152
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,500
在受到惊扰时攻击性也没那么强了
and are less likely to strike when disturbed.

153
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,960
眼镜蛇原本是地球上最令人生畏的动物之一
One of the most feared animals on the planet

154
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,190
但它们在这里却得到了人们的接纳
has found a place where they are accepted

155
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,270
与人类平和地生活在一起
and can co-exist with human beings.

156
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,580
不过对其它很多
But for many animals

157
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,650
生活在人类社会中的动物而言
living in the human world,

158
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,730
保持低调才是生存的要诀
it pays to keep a low profile.

159
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,770
在澳大利亚的墨尔本
Here in Melbourne, Australia,

160
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,240
有一种动物掌握了登峰造极的伪装技术
one creature has perfected the art of camouflage.

161
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,650
这是一只茶色蟆口鸱雏鸟
A frogmouth chick.

162
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,560
白天 它的爸爸会帮它做好伪装庇护
Its father helps to hide it during the day.

163
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,920
茶色蟆口鸱是夜行鸟类
They are nocturnal birds

164
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,670
夜幕降临后
and as day turns to night

165
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,820
成年茶色蟆口鸱离开巢穴
its parents come out of the shadows

166
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,180
趁着夜色开始在城市中搜寻食物
to reap the rewards of urban living.

167
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,580
照明灯光
The city lights

168
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,200
为它们的捕猎提供了绝佳的条件
create excellent conditions for hunting.

169
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,670
城市的每个夜晚
Every night in the city

170
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,680
都像满月时一样明朗
is as bright as when there's a full moon.

171
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,660
茶色蟆口鸱总能找到
So city Frogmouths often

172
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,400
足够的猎物喂养雏鸟
have their mouths full.

173
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,750
小家伙成长得很快
He's growing fast…

174
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,790
今天 它一直在淘气地动来动去
and today he just won't sit still…

175
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,520
接着 它突然打破伪装 暴露无遗
and now he has revealed his presence.

176
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,780
茶色蟆口鸱的首条生活准则是
The first rule of Frogmouth behaviour is

177
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,050
白天静止不动
don't move in the day…

178
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,160
但它们生命中总有一段时间
but this the one time in a Frogmouth's life

179
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,350
完全无法抑制自己飞翔的冲动
when the urge to fly simply cannot be suppressed.

180
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,060
不过 它还没有做好离开巢穴的准备
But he's not ready to leave home just yet.

181
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,430
又到了晚上
Come night-time

182
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,560
饥饿感再次袭来
he's hungry again…

183
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,450
茶色蟆口鸱雏鸟精神百倍
he's wide awake,

184
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,860
打算继续白天的尝试
and wants to take off where he left off.

185
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,730
它的行动引起了某些动物的注意
But he's getting unwanted attention…

186
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,510
但爸爸妈妈不在身边
and this time his parent is not nearby

187
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,750
没办法保护它
to protect him.

188
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,360
人类带出了自己的宠物
Humans bring pets

189
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,550
在澳大利亚
and cats in Australia

190
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,870
家猫每天可以杀死上百万只鸟类
kill a million birds a day.

191
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,340
这是它第一次展翅飞翔
His first proper flight,

192
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,260
小家伙必须找到一个休息的地方
but unless he can find a safe place to roost,

193
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,530
否则它的处境还是一样危险
he is still in peril.

194
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,920
成功了
Made it.

195
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,720
要想在城市里生存下去
But if he is to survive in the city

196
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,000
它必须和父母一样
like the adults

197
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,210
学会如何融入周围的环境
he'll have to learn how to blend in.

198
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,060
有些动物非常大胆
Some animals are so bold

199
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,040
甚至不屑于隐藏自己
that they don't even try to hide.

200
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,280
在高楼林立的城市中
To see a large predator in the built-up world

201
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,370
我们很少见到这种大型捕食动物
is a rare sight.

202
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,450
北美洲太浩湖附近的美洲黑熊
And here in Lake Tahoe, in North America,

203
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,960
体形似乎比同类更加健硕
these black bears are particularly big.

204
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,180
它们径直走向城镇的中心地带
And they're heading right to the centre of town.

205
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,600
冬天快要到了
Winter is approaching,

206
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,080
美洲黑熊必须在下雪之前
and these bears need to put on as much weight as possible

207
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,460
尽可能地增加体重
before the snow arrives.

208
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,150
这里可以享用到大量的食物
This is the great place to gorge.

209
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,690
俨然成为了美洲黑熊的理想王国
It's now bear country.

210
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,080
何必还要费力捕食呢
Why struggle for a meal…

211
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,980
穿过街道
when you can cross the street

212
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,620
就能轻松找到美味的餐点
for a takeaway.

213
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,300
城镇里有很多的食物
There's so much food here

214
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,400
一些美洲黑熊的体重
that some of the bears are 50% heavier

215
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,500
已经达到了乡间其它同类的1.5倍左右
than their country cousins.

216
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,720
当然它们没有止步于此
But why stop here?

217
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,080
一些美洲黑熊也想进屋里来用餐
Some bears just want to dine in.

218
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,950
有些动物很幸运
A lucky few

219
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,610
可以在人类世界轻松找到一顿美餐
are able to get an easy meal from the human world.

220
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,350
而人类到自然界中寻找食物资源时
But when we venture to the natural world in search of food,

221
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,390
其捕获规模可就另当别论了
the harvest is on a different scale.

222
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,460
短短40年的大规模捕捞
In just four decades

223
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,060
已经造成全球鱼类数量减少了一半
fishing reduced fish populations by half,

224
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,300
人类的捕捞
and created great problems

225
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,880
给原本以鱼类为食的海洋捕食动物
for the ocean predators

226
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,680
带来了巨大的麻烦
that once had such food to themselves.

227
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,120
在温哥华岛附近
Off the coast of Vancouver Island

228
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,900
大翅鲸栖息的海域
humpback whales inhabit waters

229
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,900
深受鲱鱼过度捕捞的影响
where herring have been over-fished.

230
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,130
众所周知
Humpbacks, however,

231
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,130
大翅鲸是一种非常聪明的动物
are renowned for their ingenuity.

232
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,300
12年前
Twelve years ago,

233
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,240
一头名叫康格的成年雄性大翅鲸
an adult male called Conger,

234
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,380
采用了一种全新的捕食方法
adopted a totally new way of feeding.

235
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,220
当海中鱼类的密度较低
When the density of fish in the water is low

236
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,000
鸟类纷纷潜入海中捕鱼的时候
and birds are diving to catch them,

237
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,670
康格就会浮到海面张开大嘴
the humpback opens its mouth

238
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,750
鱼类会将它看作可以躲避鸟类的庇护所
and creates a space that the fish mistake for shelter.

239
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,170
它们争先恐后地游进这个黑洞
The fish swim in

240
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,310
陷阱随即闭合
and the trap is closed.

241
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,820
康格是人类发现的
Conger was the first humpback whale

242
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,700
第一头使用这种方法的大翅鲸
to be seen doing this,

243
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,420
现在 附近海域已经有30多头大翅鲸
now 30 whales in the area

244
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,660
学会了使用这种策略
use the same technique.

245
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,320
温哥华岛附近的大翅鲸数量还在增加
The population of humpbacks here is growing,

246
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,030
或许大家认为
and you might think

247
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,130
这会造成鱼类数量的进一步减少
that this would reduce fish stocks even more,

248
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,870
但结果却出乎人们的意料
but something surprising is thought to be happening.

249
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,520
这种微小的浮游植物
These tiny phytoplankton

250
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,950
是整个食物链的基础
are the basis of the food chain

251
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,200
它们的生长需要一种关键元素
and need a vital ingredient to grow,

252
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,660
铁
iron.

253
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,800
鲸类的粪便含铁量很高
Whale faeces are rich in iron,

254
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,650
而巨型鲸类可以提供大量的粪便
and great whales produce it in enormous quantities.

255
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,920
于是浮游植物大量增加
So the phytoplankton flourishes

256
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,300
而这些正是鲱鱼的食物
and the herring feed on it.

257
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,840
事实上 鲸的粪便
Whale faeces in fact

258
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,390
有助于整个海洋生态系统的恢复
are helping to restore the whole ecosystem.

259
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,360
鲱鱼吸引来了更多的海鸟
The herring attracts sea birds.

260
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,340
有些鸟类潜入水下对鱼群发起攻击
Diving birds attack them from beneath,

261
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,540
而海鸥和鹱则从上方俯冲捕食鱼类
and gulls and shearwaters dive on them from above.

262
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,820
连白头海雕都能从盛宴中分得一杯羹
Even Bald eagles benefit from this rich feast.

263
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,420
令人惊讶的是
Astonishingly

264
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,650
虽然康格和其它鲸都会捕食鱼类
even though Conger and all the other whales are feasting on fish…

265
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,800
但它们也给海洋带来了丰富的养分
their role in fertilising the ocean is so influential,

266
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,300
因此专家估计鲱鱼的数量
that herring numbers here

267
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,400
不会减少 反而还会增加
are actually predicted to increase.

268
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,250
鲸给大海带来了活力
And the role they play in rejuvenating the environment

269
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,410
它给人类世界带来的影响更加意义非凡
is having an even greater impact on the human world.

270
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,220
浮游植物和陆地树木一样
The flourishing plankton also collects carbon

271
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,880
也可以吸收环境中的二氧化碳
from the atmosphere just as trees do.

272
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,430
由此估算 一头巨型鲸的影响
So much so that each great whale

273
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,080
甚至足以媲美
has the same impact

274
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,500
一片拥有30000棵树木的森林
as a forest of 30,000 trees.

275
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,660
巨型鲸类曾经遭到人类的大量捕杀
Our great whales were once hunted,

276
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,130
如果它们的种群数量
and if they returned

277
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,180
恢复到商业捕鲸开始之前的规模
to their pre-whaling numbers

278
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,310
那就相当于我们种植了
it's estimated that this would be equivalent to planting

279
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,350
超过300亿棵树木
over 30 billion trees.

280
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,840
如今 我们已经认识到
Whales are now being recognized

281
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,940
鲸类的存在对人类有益
as benefiting humanity.

282
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,330
但多数大型动物
But for most large animals

283
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,030
仍会因资源竞争而与人类发生冲突
competition with humans brings conflict.

284
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,670
这头6吨重的雄性非洲象正值壮年
This six tonne African bull elephant is in his prime.

285
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,860
要想在争夺交配权时占据上风
To stand the best chance of winning fights for females,

286
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,840
它就必须保持魁梧健壮
he needs to be big.

287
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,080
它根据气味判断
He can smell

288
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,040
周围有营养丰富的食物
highly nutritious food is near.

289
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,300
但是穿越边界到达那里
But crossing the boundary to reach it

290
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,290
需要承担很高的风险
is a dangerous journey.

291
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,310
必须等到夜幕降临才能行动
He must wait for the cover of darkness.

292
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,700
田里的肯尼亚农民
These Kenyan farmers

293
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,820
正在忙着为即将到来的夜晚做准备
are preparing for the night ahead.

294
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,280
过去两个月来 他们每天晚上
They have had to guard their crops every night

295
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,200
都要小心守护自己的农田
for the last two months.

296
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,220
还有两天就要收获了
With only two days until harvest,

297
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,730
此时绝对不能有闪失
this is a critical time.

298
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,820
一头雄性非洲象
In a single night

299
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,050
只需一个晚上就能毁掉
a bull elephant can destroy the entire crops

300
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,120
10位农民辛苦种植的庄稼
produced by ten farmers.

301
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,690
这头非洲象决定以身犯险
But he's taking a huge risk.

302
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,340
它的身高相当于成年男性的两倍
He's twice the height of a man

303
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,200
并不打算轻易就范
and he won't back down easily.

304
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,590
这样的人兽冲突
This human wildlife conflict

305
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,970
几乎每天晚上都会发生
happens night after night.

306
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,530
仅在肯尼亚
And each year

307
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,810
每年就有200头非洲象
it takes the lives of up to 200 elephants

308
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,960
和20人为此付出生命的代价
and 20 people in Kenya alone.

309
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,560
这样的对峙潜藏着巨大的风险
This stand-off is potentially lethal.

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,340
当地农民
The farmers

311
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,080
只能向经验丰富的巡护员寻求帮助
have had to call for help from a team of highly experienced rangers.

312
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,550
他们虽然带着武器
Although they're armed,

313
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,120
但目的只是把非洲象赶出农田
their task is to drive the elephant out of the field

314
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,840
不会伤害对方
without harming it.

315
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,930
然而雄性非洲象非常固执
But the bull is determined

316
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,580
就是不肯走
to hold ground.

317
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,470
巡护员只能继续向它逼近
The rangers will have to get closer.

318
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,430
他们快步靠近
On foot.

319
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,940
迫不得已之下
The rangers have to resort

320
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,580
他们动用了爆竹驱赶非洲象
to firecrackers.

321
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,010
雄性非洲象终于离开农田
The bull is driven from this the field

322
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,720
向灌木丛深处跑去
and retreats deep into the bush.

323
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,980
这头雄性非洲象很幸运
Fortunately for this bull

324
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,010
冲突以和平方式解决
the battle has been resolved peacefully.

325
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,360
这些策略和努力
And efforts like these

326
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,610
避免了对非洲象造成伤害
are seeing fewer elephants killed

327
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:20,560
肯尼亚的非洲象数量又开始增加了
and their population in Kenya is starting to rise again.

328
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,890
不过由于人类对全球气候的巨大改变
But conflict with wildlife is now occurring on a far greater scale

329
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,420
导致我们与野生动物之间的冲突规模
as a consequence of the way we are changing

330
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,980
也在不断升级
the world's climate.

331
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,750
一些干旱地区迎来了罕见的暴雨
Some arid regions are now experiencing unusually high rainfall.

332
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,030
这对非洲东北部地区的
And that is good for growing crops

333
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,100
粮食种植确有帮助
here in North Eastern Africa.

334
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,220
但也给一种昆虫
But it also the perfect conditions

335
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,220
提供了便利条件
for one particular insect.

336
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,650
它们就是沙漠蝗
Desert locusts.

337
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,610
沙漠蝗通常独居
They're normally solitary creatures,

338
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,120
但若从沙土中孵化的数量激增
but emerging from the sand in great numbers

339
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,070
它们连外观都会发生变化
triggers a dramatic physical change.

340
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,760
沙漠蝗的身体变成了鲜艳的黄色
They turn a vivid yellow

341
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,070
并且开始成群活动
and become highly social.

342
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,230
庞大的沙漠蝗群
Together

343
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,980
俨然成为一支势不可挡的昆虫大军
they are an unstoppable army.

344
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,450
它们先是爬行
On foot

345
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,070
每天可以前进一两公里
they can cover a mile a day.

346
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,150
但爬行毕竟有很大的局限性
But they can only go so far in this way.

347
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,920
它们必须寻找一处更高的地方
They need to find height.

348
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,800
聚集到高处后
Up here

349
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,970
沙漠蝗终于开始了最后的羽化
they begin their final transformation.

350
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,190
单只沙漠蝗通常需要至少一个月
Normally it takes an individual insect

351
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,490
才能发育为成虫 长出翅膀
at least a month to become a winged adult,

352
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,700
可聚集成群后
but in their social form,

353
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
它们的成熟速度大大加快了
their development speeds up.

354
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,960
现在 它们只需要等待翅膀变硬
Now, all they need is for their wings to harden.

355
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,610
沙漠蝗一旦飞入空中
Once airborne

356
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,660
每天就能行进近100公里
they can travel 60 miles in a day.

357
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:44,020
成群的沙漠蝗遮天蔽日 造成蝗灾
Swarms merge and they become a plague.

358
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,600
这群沙漠蝗的数量足有几十亿只
This one contains billions of individuals

359
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,510
每天吃掉的粮食数量
and eats as much in a day

360
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,600
几乎相当于德国人口的总消耗量
as the entire population of Germany.

361
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,900
如今 在非洲东北部地区
Today, in North Eastern Africa,

362
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,300
由于气候变化的影响
as a consequence of climate change

363
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,350
蝗灾变得越来越频繁了
devastating surges of locusts are becoming more frequent.

364
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,240
人与动物的世界发生着激烈的碰撞
Two worlds are colliding.

365
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,270
人类在无意之间为沙漠蝗的大规模繁殖
Unintentionally, humanity has created exactly the conditions

366
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:09,330
创造了有利条件
that cause this species to explode in numbers.

367
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,300
不过还有一类动物
But another group of animals has seen

368
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,780
也会出于人为原因
an even more dramatic rise

369
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,620
出现数量急剧增加的情况
as a consequence of our actions.

370
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,780
我们人类让地球上几种特定动物的数量
We have increased the numbers of a few species,

371
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,880
出现了几何级的增长
almost astronomically.

372
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,570
就重量来说
By weight,

373
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,230
全球70%的鸟类
70% of the world's birds

374
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,600
都是我们熟悉的鸡等家禽
are now chickens or other domesticated fowl.

375
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,570
人类每年蓄养的牲畜和家禽数量
We rear 70 billion

376
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,770
已经达到700亿左右
farm animals each year.

377
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,170
每一只个体都需要食物供应
And every one of them needs feeding.

378
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,100
这么多的家禽和家畜需要大量的饲料
Producing the food for such numbers of domesticated animals

379
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,470
相关产业给自然界造成了重大影响
is having a profound impact on the natural world.

380
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,390
亚马孙雨林的面积
The Amazon rainforest,

381
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,800
相当于印度国土面积的两倍
twice the size of India.

382
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,090
亚马孙雨林资源极其丰富
It's so rich,

383
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:54,380
物种数量相当于全球总量的十分之一左右
it contains one in every ten species on the planet.

384
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,280
这只树懒和它10个月大的幼崽
And it's home to this sloth

385
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,450
就以这里为家
and her ten-month old baby.

386
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
树懒幼崽出生的这片密林
He was born into an environment

387
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,570
以往几乎没有人类出现
virtually untouched by humanity.

388
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,810
但是现在
But now

389
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,720
这里已然开始被人类占据
human beings are claiming even this space.

390
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,250
我们每年在亚马孙地区
Year after year

391
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,090
砍伐的雨林超过200万公顷
we clear over two million hectares of the Amazon forest,

392
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,490
相当于整个威尔士的面积
an area the size of Wales.

393
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,000
这些砍伐后的土地
And we use nearly all of it

394
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,690
几乎全部用来放牧
to make more space for cattle

395
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,370
或者种植大豆为牲畜提供饲料
and to grow soya to feed our livestock.

396
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,900
如今 栖息地破坏
Today, habitat destruction

397
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,370
已经成为人类给全球野生动植物带来的
is the biggest problem we have created for wildlife

398
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,820
最大生存难题
around the world.

399
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,000
这头卷尾豪猪幸运地逃过了一场火灾
This porcupine has survived the fire.

400
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,480
它得到了人类的救助
And is being rescued.

401
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,800
它会被送往另一片原始森林
It's being relocated to pristine forests.

402
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,350
这里就是它的新家
This will be its new home.

403
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,660
只有少数幸运的动物
Only a fortunate few animals

404
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,360
能得到第二次生命
are being given such a second chance.

405
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,520
健康的自然环境
A healthy natural world

406
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,960
对野生动物来说至关重要
is not only vital for wildlife,

407
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,730
也是我们人类长久生存的必要条件
but for our own very existence.

408
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:06,550
我们必须想办法重新恢复自然平衡
Somehow we must find ways to redress the balance.

409
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:18,470
目前全球大部分的农业用地
Currently, the vast majority of agricultural land,

410
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,620
超过75%
more than 75%,

411
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,100
都是用来饲养禽畜
is used to raise livestock,

412
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,720
这种模式效率很低
and this is very inefficient.

413
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,860
我们可以找到解决方法
There are solutions,

414
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,690
第一种是考虑改变饮食结构
one is considering what we eat.

415
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,250
如果大家少吃肉食和牛奶
If we shift away from eating meat and dairy

416
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,230
多吃蔬菜等素食
and move towards a plant-based diet,

417
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,120
那么太阳能就可以直接转化为人类的食物
then the sun's energy goes directly into growing our food…

418
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,980
这种方式更加高效
and because that's so much more efficient,

419
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,210
我们完全可以生产出足够的粮食
we could still produce enough to feed us…

420
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,250
而且只需当前四分之一的农田就好
but do so using a quarter of the land.

421
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,120
我们由此节省出的农业用地
This could free up an area the size

422
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,300
相当于美国 中国
of the United States, China,

423
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,610
欧盟和澳大利亚面积的总和
the European Union, and Australia combined.

424
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,640
这些空间都可以重新回归自然
Space that could then be given back to nature.

425
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,290
人类的创新
And human innovations

426
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,680
或许可以为野生动物的生存做出更大的贡献
may be able to do even more for wildlife.

427
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,660
现在的高科技农业可以垂直种植作物
High tech farms now grow plants vertically,

428
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,040
单位面积的粮食产量
yielding up to 350 times

429
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,490
可以提升到原来的350倍左右
the food grown in the same area.

430
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,270
这只是我们的众多解决方案之一
This is one of many solutions we already have,

431
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,220
还有很多其它方案有望推广
and others are surely on the horizon.

432
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,290
要找到方法保护地球上的所有生物
To find ways to protect all life on Earth

433
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:31,040
我们就必须重新规划人类未来的生活模式
means re-imaging how we live on this planet in the future.

434
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,260
人类有聪明才智
Human ingenuity –

435
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,660
一定能找到合适的解决方法
our extraordinary ability to find solutions –

436
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,460
我有信心一定能成功
gives me hope that we can.

437
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,330
这将是当前和下一代人
It will be the major challenge

438
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,110
必须面对的首要问题
for this generation and the next.

439
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,710
为了拍摄火灾对亚马孙雨林的影响
To film the impact that fires are having on the Amazon

440
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,770
《地球脉动III》摄制组
the Planet Earth III team

441
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,820
加入了当地的志愿消防队
joined a local volunteer fire-brigade.

442
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,950
这支消防队要前往
The fire-brigade are responding to a patch

443
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,030
这次雨林火灾的主要区域
of primary rainforest that is burning.

444
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,970
现在火灾已经持续了两天
It's been burning for two days now,

445
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,020
很难想象我们会看到怎样的场景
it's difficult to know what we're going to see.

446
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,050
这些火灾通常是非法纵火造成的
The fires are mainly lit illegally…

447
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,900
目的是腾出空间用来饲养牲畜
to clear space for cattle.

448
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,650
火灾很严重
It's really intense.

449
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,000
看那边的火情
Look at the fires over there.

450
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,590
我以前从没见过这样的景象
I've never seen anything like that before.

451
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,020
快点 用水泵
Come on, use the water pump!

452
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,390
离远点
Do it from far!

453
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,450
压住那个区域的火势
Stop that fire on the corner!

454
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,770
对抗火灾是一项危险的工作
Battling fires is dangerous work,

455
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,250
但消防员每天都要面对这样的情况
but the firefighters face them every day…

456
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,240
对野生动物摄制组来说
for the wildlife film crew

457
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,660
这是一次全新的体验
this is a totally new experience…

458
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,760
而火情的发展完全无法预料
and these fires can be unpredictable.

459
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,420
尼尔 别在那里待太久
Neil, don't spend long in there.

460
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,190
我们得小心一点 别让大火烧到这边
We need to be careful so the fire doesn't get here.

461
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,760
现在的风向很危险
The way the wind is right now it's dangerous.

462
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,120
我们得赶快离开
I think we've got to run.

463
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,390
我去取延时摄像机
I'll get the timelapse.

464
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,720
往这边跑
Run this way!

465
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,160
太可怕了
It's quite scary.

466
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,610
地面摄制组撤离之后
With the ground team retreating,

467
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,590
最安全的拍摄方式就是使用无人机
the safest way to carry on filming is with the drone.

468
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,350
无人机弄丢了吗
Have we lost the drone?

469
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,660
阿比好像看见了 她已经过去了
Eh I think Abi has seen it, Abi's on her way.

470
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,480
你是去找无人机了吗 阿比
Can you confirm you're on your way to the drone Abi?

471
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,180
无人机飞到了大火上方
The drone has gone up in flames.

472
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,890
我拿到无人机了
I have the drone.

473
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,420
它在我们面前坠毁了
It crashed in front of us.

474
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,370
它着火了
It was on fire.

475
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:55,480
无人机已经损坏 无法修复了
The drone is damaged beyond repair.

476
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,870
别担心 真的 别担心无人机
Don't worry about it, I mean don't worry about it.

477
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,420
没事
It's absolutely fine.

478
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,660
可机器坏了
They are not OK.

479
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,000
真的 没关系 只是一台机器
It is. It's ok, it's equipment

480
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,100
我们还有一台备用的
we've got a spare.

481
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,990
重要的是 我们都很安全
The main thing is we're all safe,

482
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,030
没有人受伤
no one's hurt.

483
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,530
团队集合到一起
The team re-group,

484
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,000
决定离开火灾的中心
and decide to move away from the heart of the fire

485
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,440
转移到边缘地带
to its fringes

486
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,290
寻找被大火困住的动物
to look for animals caught up in the flames.

487
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,870
报告说有只猴子被困在这片树林
There's been reports of a monkey in the trees.

488
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,640
问题是这边沿线都有火情
The problem is there's fires all the way along here,

489
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,000
这边也是
as well as all along here,

490
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
所以很难确定这些野生动物会做什么
so it's hard to know what all this wildlife is going to do

491
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,960
它们的家都被大火烧光了
when their home is burnt up like this.

492
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,520
我不知道雨林中的动物遇到火灾
I don't know what it's like for these rainforest animals

493
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,810
会是一种什么样的感觉
to be experiencing a fire,

494
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,980
我自己都觉得很可怕 所以
it's horrific for me so

495
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,600
很难想象它们是什么感受
I don't know what it is for them.

496
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,210
大火一直持续到当天晚间
The fires burn into the night.

497
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,700
第二天
The following day

498
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,320
摄制组和消防员一起出发
the crew accompany the firefighters

499
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,740
到大火过后的森林里展开搜救
in the search for animals in the aftermath.

500
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,030
我的天哪
Oh my god,

501
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,100
蚁巢里面也着火了
there are flames all inside of it.

502
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,060
看那些白蚁
The termite,

503
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,520
老天哪
oh, my god.

504
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,500
一些动物奇迹般地活了下来
Remarkably, some animals have survived.

505
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,080
我感到很痛心
For me, it hurts a lot

506
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:56,050
因为大自然和我们一样都有生命
because nature is alive, just like we are.

507
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,090
人类的特性 大自然也都具备
Everything that we have, it has too.

508
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:07,140
看到森林变成这样真的很难过
so it's sad to see the forest like this.

509
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,700
它应该得到保护
It deserves more,

510
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,260
不应该被这样对待
it shouldn't be treated like this.

511
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,560
大自然强大
It must be strong

512
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,430
才能给予我们力量
to give us strength

513
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,390
如果它虚弱无力 我们也会感到虚弱
because if it gets weaker, we will feel weaker

514
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,150
如果它倒下了 人类也会灭亡
and if it falls, we all fall.

515
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,990
清理林地用来放牧
Clearing land for farming

516
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:37,470
并不是亚马孙地区独有的问题
is not a problem unique to the Amazon.

517
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,200
农业用地现在已经占到
Agriculture now takes up

518
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,080
全球可居住土地的大约一半
half of the habitable land on the planet.

519
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,650
我们必须找到新的方法
To produce food with less impact on the natural world

520
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:52,980
减少粮食生产过程对自然界的影响
requires new approaches

521
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,230
为此 摄制组来到了一个农场
and that lead the wildlife film crew to a farm

522
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,320
而它却在一座仓库里
in a warehouse.

523
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,790
我们来到了城市中央
We're in the middle of a city

524
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,550
难以想象这么多食物
I can't believe so much food been grown

525
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,390
能生长在这么小的空间里
in such a small space.

526
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,600
在距离亚马孙雨林
Here in Los Angeles,

527
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,060
9000多公里的洛杉矶
6,000 miles from the Amazon,

528
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,910
这座新奇的农场
this farm is part of a

529
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,900
就是人类粮食革命的前沿阵地
burgeoning food revolution.

530
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,480
这是全球产能最高的农场
This is the most productive farm in the world

531
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,820
我们的目标就是
and it's our goal

532
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,250
将种植业的土地和资源使用量
to reduce the amount of land and resources necessary to grow,

533
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,570
降到最低
down to the bare minimum.

534
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,460
我们花了很长时间才明白
It took a while to understand that

535
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,810
对大自然而言 农业用地
for nature agriculture use of land

536
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:40,990
是人类破坏环境的主要原因
was the primary destructive behaviour of humanity.

537
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,700
随着这种种植方式的推广
As we expand this means of growing,

538
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,090
希望可以通过这种方法
I'm very hopeful that this approach

539
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,680
最终能让大量土地回归自然
can ultimately give a lot of land back to nature

540
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,460
让地球恢复原有的生物多样性
and allow that biodiversity

541
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,060
继续繁荣发展
to re-establish and flourish.

542
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:57,720
这座农场不仅缩小了占地面积
Not only does this farm use less space

543
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,790
灌溉用水量也同时缩减了90%
but it also uses 90% less water,

544
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,470
而且不使用农药
no pesticides

545
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,270
还减少了食物里程
and cuts food miles.

546
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,610
我认为这是个很好的开始
It does feel like a really good start.

547
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,240
类似这样的创新
Ideas like this

548
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,280
可以减少人类对地球的影响
can reduce our footprint on the planet,

549
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:24,080
希望大自然可以由此重焕生机
giving the natural world a chance to bounce back.
