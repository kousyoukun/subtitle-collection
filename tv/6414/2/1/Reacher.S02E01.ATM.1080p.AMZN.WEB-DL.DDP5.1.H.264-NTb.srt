00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,764
我们有名字
- We've got names. - [grunts]

148
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,057
桑切斯和奥罗斯科
Sanchez and Orozco.

149
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,391
哪个是奥罗斯科?
Which one's Orozco?

150
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,810
[Orozco speaks Spanish]

151
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,940
除了话痨 你又是什么人?
And who are you, besides a guy who talks too much?

152
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,483
大卫奥唐纳
David O'Donnell.

153
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,820
无意冒犯 老大爷 但你来这里做什么?
And no offense, Pops, but, uh, why are you here?

154
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,864
你是错过了老年电视剧还是怎么着?
Isn't there a CBS drama you're missing?

155
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,659
劳莱曾六次赢得陆军
Lowrey won the Army Marksmanship competition

156
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,118
手枪和步枪射击比赛
six times, both pistol and rifle class.

157
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:56,870
我有个规矩
I've got a rule.

158
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,164
一旦打出第一枪 计划就见鬼去吧
Plans go to hell soon as first shot's been fired,

159
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,708
所以你们的第一枪 最好是打得最准的一枪
so your first shot better be your best shot.

160
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,461
我是唯一一个赢得 千码邀请赛的非海军队员
I'm the only non-Marine to win

161
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,003
the USMC 1,000 Yard Invitational, and I still know

162
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,922
而且我都知道劳莱 是我们最厉害的“第一枪”
Lowrey gives us our best first shot.

163
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,800
你觉得这支队伍会遭受枪击?
You think this unit's gonna come under a lot of fire?

164
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,009
说不准
Maybe.

165
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,096
那你为什么要找 没有警察经历的人来 雷彻少校?
[O'Donnell] Then why'd you grab a bunch of people

166
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,096
with no police experience, Major Reacher?

167
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,305
- 叫我雷彻 - 叫他雷彻
- Reacher. - Reacher.

168
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,058
对不起
Sorry. [clears throat]

169
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,896
军队需要一支 专门处理复杂事务的队伍
Army wanted a unit for particularly

170
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,896
complex matters when they arose.

171
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,401
为此 我需要特别调查员 不是一般的宪兵
To do that, I need special investigators, not generic MPs.

172
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,320
如果我们那么特别 那为什么给我们的办公室这么垃圾?
If we're so special, why did they stick us in this dump?

173
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,655
这地方是怎么回事?
I mean, what is up with this place?

174
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:35,575
几年前 山姆大叔 出价购买了这条街上的一些土地
Few years ago, Uncle Sam made an auction bid

175
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,450
for some land down the road.

176
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,910
地址输反了
Entered the address backwards and became the proud owners

177
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,330
就成了这栋建筑的骄傲的主人 而且还成了现已结业的
of this building and the contents

178
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,332
of the now-defunct Callahan Insurance Agency.

179
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,124
卡拉翰保险公司的所有人

180
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,712
但你说得对 办公地点可以更好一点
But you're right.

181
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,504
Place could work a little better.

182
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,880
整理好这些箱子
Straighten up these boxes, move these old tanker desks

183
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,800
把这些旧桌子移到房间中间
to the middle of the room. [sighs]

184
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,142
动手吧
Let's go. You don't have to call me "Major,"

185
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,601
你们不必叫我少校
but you do have to move your ass when I say so.

186
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,521
但我让你们行动时 你们必须动起来 开始吧
Get to it.

187
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,361
向后退
Go backwards.

188
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,696
你想让我向后退?
[Dixon] Okay, you want me to go backwards?

189
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,448
- 我要向后退 - 向后退
- I'm going backwards. - Go back.

190
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,867
- 腿用力 抬起来 - 没人用腿抬
[Sanchez] Lift with your legs, man!

191
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,327
数到三 一、二、三 抬
- No one lifts with their legs. - On three. One, two, three, go.

192
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,619
你这么抬不对
- You're doing it wrong. - [tables scraping]

193
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,163
我是按你说的做的
[O'Donnell] I'm doing it exactly how you told me to.

194
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,666
你觉得我们真能一起工作?
You think we're actually gonna be able to work together?

195
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,501
腿用力 抬起来
No idea.

196
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,419
我不知道

197
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,380
但我可以请大家喝酒
But I could use a beer.

198
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,550
跟他们说我买单
Tell them I'm buying.

199
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,221
威廉斯堡 纽约布鲁克林

200
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,307
[? Jeff Cormack: "Sunshine's Gone"]

201
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,821
<i>? You ?</i>

202
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,992
<i>? Way you're loving's so wrong ?</i>

203
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,246
- <i>? Got a heart made of stone ?</i> - [indistinct chatter]

204
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,792
<i>? Got a mind that's so wrong ?</i>

205
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:11,046
<i>? The way you love me is gone...</i>

206
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,631
雷彻
- Reacher. - [exhales]

207
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,757
内格利
Neagley.

208
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,721
谢谢你点餐 杯子里还冒着热气
Thanks for ordering.

209
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,679
Still steam coming off the cup.

210
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,641
我在网上追踪了航班信息 看到它提前落地了
Tracked the plane online, saw it landed early,

211
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,185
你不托运行李 我算了通勤时间
you don't check bags and I adjusted for traffic.

212
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,853
90秒前倒的咖啡
Had the coffee poured 90 seconds ago.

213
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,522
食物已经上桌三分钟了
Food's been there three minutes.

214
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,731
非常感谢
Appreciated.

215
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,567
这是从哪儿弄到的?
Where'd you get this?

216
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,198
我是私家侦探 能搜集到这些东西
I'm a PI. I can get things.

217
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,827
距离马格雷夫一别有些时日了
Been a minute since Margrave.

218
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,871
是两年七个月19天
Been two years, seven months, 19 days.

219
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,207
你气色不错
You look good.

220
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,084
我看起来没变化
I look the same.

221
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,630
跟两年七个月19天前一样好
You looked good two years, seven months,

222
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,381
19 days ago, so, yeah.

223
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,716
所以你看起来也一样

224
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,678
你看起来鞍马劳顿
You look the same.

225
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,636
You look... road-worn.

226
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,847
是啊
Yep.

227
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,642
那么 弗朗茨 给我讲讲大体情况
So, Franz.

228
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,560
Give me the Cliff Notes.

229
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,021
大约一周前 他离家后失踪了
Went missing after leaving his home in Brooklyn

230
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,980
about a week or so ago.

231
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,399
尸体被发现于卡兹奇山
Body was found in the Catskill Mountains.

232
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,443
整个警察局有20名警察
Whole force up there is, like, 20 cops.

233
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,529
弗朗茨在城里失踪后 纽约市警察局开始牵头调查
And since Franz disappeared in the city,

234
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,529
NYPD's taking the lead.

235
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,449
- 你是怎么知道的? - 安吉拉给我打了电话
How'd you find out?

236
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,449
Got a call from Angela.

237
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,786
- 弗朗茨的遗孀 - 弗朗茨结婚了?
Franzy's widow.

238
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,998
是啊 很有趣的婚礼 还有巧克力喷泉
- Franz was married? - Yeah.

239
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,998
Fun wedding. Chocolate fountain.

240
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,459
他还有个儿子
He had a son, too.

241
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,464
怎么了?大块头 你不在的时候 生活还在继续
What? Life moves on when you're away, big fella.

242
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,509
还有什么消息?
- What else? - Franz left me a few messages

243
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,262
他失踪前几天给我留了几条信息
in the days before his disappearance.

244
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,724
想从我这里了解一些 他正在追查的案件的信息
Said he wanted to bounce some stuff off of me

245
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,724
about a case he was chasing down.

246
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,102
我当时忙着做自己的工作 我一直想回去找他来着
I was so tied up with my own work,

247
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,437
I kept meaning to get back to him, but...

248
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,732
但在我找他之前 安吉拉联系我 说他被杀了
before I could, Angela reached out

249
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,732
and told me he'd been murdered.

250
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,860
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

251
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,490
- 我知道 - 他不仅仅是被谋杀
- I know. - He wasn't just murdered.

252
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,283
还受到了折磨
He was tortured.

253
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,786
他的胃里只有粘液 脱水了 没有食物 没有水
Nothing but mucus in his stomach.

254
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,786
Dehydrated. No food, no water.

255
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,038
他被扔出了飞机
Chucked out of a plane.

256
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,790
他们不可能是把他扔下飞机的
They didn't throw him from a plane.

257
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,125
他的尸体被发现于荒无人烟的地方
He was found in the middle of nowhere with injuries

258
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,461
受伤情况跟从一公里的高处 坠落的伤口相吻合
consistent with a fall from 3,000 feet.

259
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,965
飞机的失速速度是多少来着? 每小时130公里?最高160公里?
An airplane has a stall speed of what?

260
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,965
80 miles an hour? 100, tops?

261
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,927
他们会垂直把他扔到气流中
They would've shoved him out of the door's plane horizontally

262
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,345
他会撞到机翼或机尾
into the slipstream.

263
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,345
He'd bang into the wing or tail.

264
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,972
那样会造成死前伤口 但他身上没有
There'd be perimortem injuries and there aren't.

265
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,682
他是被从直升机上扔下来的
He was thrown from a helicopter.

266
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,770
- 他的腿骨折不是坠地造成的 - 此话怎讲?
His broken legs weren't from the fall, anyway.

267
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,271
Because?

268
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,232
看他的血液检查结果
Look at his blood work.

269
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,859
充满了游离组胺 这反映出了剧烈的疼痛反应
Full of free histamines. Massive pain reaction.

270
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,695
直到死前 游离组胺的含量都极高
You don't get these kind of levels from injuries

271
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,073
断腿是几天前的事
sustained at the time of death.

272
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,781
Broken legs were a few days old.

273
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,076
因此 在他裤子的布料中 发现了氧化亚铁粉
That's why ferrous oxide powder was found in his pants fabric.

274
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,912
他曾被一根生锈的铁棒击中
He was hit with a rusty iron bar.

275
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,164
一定疼死了
- Must've hurt like hell. - Yep.

276
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:55,418
是啊 他要么是因为报复而被折磨 要么是因为情报

277
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,085
He was tortured for either revenge or information.

278
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,672
凶手得手以后 把他从空中丢出 避免了使用枪支
When they were done with him, they dumped him from the sky

279
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,421
to avoid ballistics.

280
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,259
几个大学生在徒步的时候 发现了尸体
[Neagley] Couple of college kids wandered off their hiking trail,

281
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,259
saw the body.

282
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,553
否则谁知道他什么时候才会被发现?
If not for them, who knows when he would've been found?

283
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,725
那么 接下来呢?
So, next steps?

284
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,648
如果他给你打过电话 那他可能也给队里其他人打过
If he was calling you for help, he may have been trying

285
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,648
to get in touch with the rest of the unit.

286
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,149
大概是失败了
Probably failed.

287
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,819
我给奥唐纳、迪克森 桑切斯和奥罗斯科打了电话
I called O'Donnell, Dixon,

288
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,404
都没人接
Sanchez and Orozco. No one's answering.

289
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:26,116
斯旺没有登记电话号码 连我的办公室都找不到他的电话
No listed number for Swan.

290
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,824
Even my office can't find it.

291
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,452
他总是非常注重隐私 劳莱呢?
Always a private guy.

292
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,997
他两年前死于蒙大拿的一场车祸
What about Lowrey?

293
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,997
Killed two years ago in a car accident in Montana.

294
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,458
葬礼非常伤感 但很高兴再次见到这伙人
Funeral was sad, but...

295
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,085
it was good to see the gang again.

296
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,421
我猜你不在的时候 有些人也走向了终点
Guess life ends when you're away, too.

297
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:44,551
弗朗茨的婚礼、劳莱的葬礼 全都没人告诉我
Franz's wedding, Lowrey's funeral.

298
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,094
没有电话 没有地址
No one told me.

299
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,094
No phone, no address.

300
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,805
你本来可以像今天一样 给我发一条紧急取款机信息
You could've sent me an emergency

301
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,805
ATM message like today.

302
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,099
首先 我刚想到这个方法
First off, I just thought of that.

303
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,768
其次 那也不是紧急情况
Second, it wasn't really an emergency.

304
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,062
紧急的是卡车撞上劳莱的那一刻
The emergency was the moment the pickup hit Lowrey.

305
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,025
而且说实话 你真的愿意 大老远地从德州或缅因州
And be honest,

306
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,649
would you really have travelled all the way to Montana

307
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,819
或你当时所在的地方赶到蒙大拿
from Texas or Maine or wherever you were at the time

308
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,362
就为了看一眼盒子里的尸体?
just to look at a body in a box?

309
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:05,905
不愿意
No.

310
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,621
那我再问一次 接下来呢?
So I'll ask again. Next steps?

311
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,751
你真的想让其他警察 去处理我们死去的朋友的案子?
You really want to let some other cops

312
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,751
handle our dead friend's case?

313
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,172
我也这么想
That's what I thought.

314
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,051
我们去见见弗朗茨的遗孀吧
Let's go see Franzy's widow.

315
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,821
? ?

316
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,535

<i>[line picks up]</i>

318
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,795
她刚跟大块头见了面
She just met up with the big one.

319
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,508
<i>[line ringing]</i>

320
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,469
我是大卫奥唐纳 我现在不在
<i>[O'Donnell] You've reached David O'Donnell.</i>

321
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,554
请留言 我会回电
<i>I'm not around; leave a message. I'll call you back.</i>

322
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,891
奥唐纳 我是雷彻 现在急需帮忙
O'Donnell. This is Reacher with another 10-30.

323
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,936
内格利和我住在布鲁克林的瓦尔酒店
Neagley and I are staying at the Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.

324
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,105
快行动 给我们回电
Get off your ass and call us back.

325
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,398
[phone beeps off]

326
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,316
我们没法给斯旺打电话
So, we can't call Swan.

327
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,652
奥唐纳、桑切斯和奥罗斯科 还是不接电话
O'Donnell, Sanchez and Orozco still don't answer.

328
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,487
迪克森办公室的接待员
And the receptionist at Dixon's office says

329
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,281
说她不知道她在哪儿 也不知道她何时回来
she can't say where Dixon is or when she'll return.

330
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,450
可能是在做卧底工作
Probably an undercover job.

331
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,535
也许吧
Maybe.

332
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,746
也许他们也遇到麻烦了
Or maybe they're all in trouble, too.

333
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,332
[? FunkeyMonkeys: "I'd Like A Banana"]

334
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,418
? ?

335
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,382
<i>? I'd like a banana, I'd like a banana ?</i>

336
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,803
<i>? I'd like a banana ?</i>

337
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,390
<i>? Bananas...</i>

338
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,894
米奇 去拿你的蜡笔 玩填色游戏 好吗?
Mikey.

339
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,353
Go find your crayons and do some coloring time, okay?

340
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,771
<i>? We just ran out of bananas...</i>

341
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,022
请坐
Please sit.

00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,232
<i>? We just ran out of bananas ?</i>

343
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,317
<i>? Bananas ?</i>

344
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,322
抱歉我过了这么久才脱身
Sorry it took me so long to disengage.

345
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,951
让我姐姐挂断电话很难
It's just hard to get my sister off the phone.

346
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,537
她每小时打一次电话 是我的个人自杀督查表
She calls every hour. My own personal suicide watch.

347
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,961
抱歉 那是种病 我不应该说那话
Sorry. That was, uh, morbid.

348
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,964
你经历了那些事 想说什么都行
I shouldn't have said that.

349
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,045
[Neagley] After what you've been through,

350
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,964
you can say whatever you want.

351
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,221
你的儿子竟然长得那么像弗朗茨
Can't believe how much your son looks like Franzy.

352
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,601
我也叫他弗朗茨
I called him Franzy, too.

353
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,021
是你们中的哪个 给他起的名字来着?我忘了
Which one of you gave him that name again? I forgot.

354
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,023
奥唐纳
O'Donnell.

355
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,900
对 大卫奥唐纳
Right. David O'Donnell.

356
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
他曾经叫你“大块头”
And he used to call you The Big Guy.

357
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,781
我的天啊 卡尔文 给我讲过你们所有人的故事
My God, did Calvin ever tell me stories about you all.

358
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,701
我知道他爱我和米奇胜过一切
I know he loved me and Mikey more than anything,

359
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,080
但从他说话的方式来看 我觉得他更享受
but from the way he talked, I don't think he ever

360
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,041
had any more fun than his years spent with the 110th.

361
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,249
他在110组里度过的时光

362
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,294
这可说不准 自从你们在一起后
[Neagley] I don't know about that.

363
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,294
Ever since you guys got together,

364
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,088
每当我跟他聊天时 他看上去都很高兴
whenever I talked to him, he seemed joyful.

365
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,175
比我认识的他更加高兴
Happier than I ever knew him.

366
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,683
谢谢你这么说
Thank you f-for saying that.

367
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,358
我知道警方已经问过你一大堆问题了
I know the police have already asked you a million questions,

368
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,193
但你能讲讲时间线吗?
but do you think you could walk us through the time line?

369
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,570
当然
Sure. [sniffles]

370
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,368
我当时跟米奇在普洛佛
I was away with Mikey in Provo,

371
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,245
帮姐姐照顾我们的妈妈
helping my sister with our mom.

372
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,455
她有早发性痴呆
Early-onset dementia.

373
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,583
我试着联系了卡尔文几天 但他没有回电话
I tried Calvin for a few days, and no return calls.

374
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,836
这不像他的作风 所以我开始担心
It's not like him, so I started to worry.

375
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:48,837
我给纽约警局打电话
Called NYPD, they just said he could've been out

376
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,215
他们说他可能是出去查案子了 因为他是一名私家侦探
on a case because he was a PI

377
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:56,511
或者他可能出去参加派对了 因为他的老婆和孩子不在
or maybe he was out partying

378
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,511
because his wife and kid were out of town.

379
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:00,557
你觉得他是去做那事了吗? 出去跟损友聚会?
Do you think that's what he was doing?

380
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,598
Out partying with the wrong crowd?

381
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,480
卡尔文连晚餐迟到十分钟 都会给我打电话
Cal would call if he was gonna be ten minutes late for dinner.

382
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,442
他不会跟别人参加派对
And he didn't party with anybody.

383
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,199
所以我很担心 我提早回来 发现我们家被搜了个遍
So I got so worried,

384
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,199
I came back early to find our home ransacked.

385
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,617
什么都没被拿走
Nothing was taken.

386
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,703
警察不知道是谁干的
The cops have no idea who did it.

387
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,206
你知道他可能在查什么案子吗?
Were you aware of any cases Franz may have been working on?

388
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,499
他从不把工作带回家
He never brought work home.

389
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,920
他说他在家的时候
He said when he was here,

390
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,507
希望把百分之百的心思花在我
he wanted to be 100% present

391
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,135
for me, and Mikey.

392
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,093
还有米奇身上

393
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,221
对不起
I'm sorry. I want to help.

394
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,892
我想帮忙 这太难了

395
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,892
It's just so hard.

396
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,729
每天都很痛苦
Every day hurts.

397
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,316
再问几个问题 我保证就几个
Just a few more questions.

398
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,316
Promise.

399
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,943
好的
Okay.

400
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,488
他的客户群是什么样的?
What was his client base like?

401
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,743
华尔街那种 首席执行官 对冲基金人群
Wall Street types. CEOs, the hedge fund crowd.

402
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,997
有特别难搞的客户吗? 给他带来麻烦的?让他压力很大的?
Any of them particularly rough?

403
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,997
Causing him problems? Stressing him out?

404
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,541
一个都没有
No. Not at all. Once Mikey came along,

405
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,794
米奇一出生 他就不再做危险的工作了
he stopped doing the dangerous jobs.

406
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,130
现在看来并非如此
Or so I thought.

407
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,800
他跟110组的其他人有合作吗?
Were any other members of the 110th working with him?

408
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,386
我不知道 也许他的办公室里有什么线索
I don't know. Maybe there's something in his office.

409
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,976
门上的招牌是三河咨询公司
Sign on the door is Three Rivers Consulting and Associates.

410
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,561
在弗拉特布什103号
It's 103 Flatbush. It was trashed, too.

411
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,981
办公室也被毁了 警察在那里一无所获
The cops couldn't find anything there,

412
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,693
但弗朗茨总是告诉我
but from what Franzy always told me,

413
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,821
特别调查员不是普通的警察
the Special Investigators weren't any old group of cops.

414
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,910
不要惹特别调查员
You do not mess with the Special Investigators.

415
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,545
你爸教你的?
Your daddy teach you that?

416
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,430
你想知道你爸 是怎么成为特别调查员的吗?
Do you want to know how your dad became a Special Investigator?

417
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,560
他阻止了两个大块头士兵之间的打斗
He stopped a fight between two huge soldiers

418
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,479
因为其中一人以为
because one of them thought the other had stolen

419
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,565
另一个人偷了他妈妈给他的 饼干盒里的最后一块自制饼干
the last homemade cookie sent to him from his mom.

420
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:20,655
你爸爸让他们握手言和 再次成为朋友
Your dad got them to shake hands and be friends again.

421
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,785
而这里的这个人
And this guy, right here,

422
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,789
他想让你爸爸加入110组 因为...
he wanted your dad to be part of the 110th because...

423
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,836
他发现了一个能在情况激烈时 保持冷静的人
...he saw a man who stayed cool when things got heated.

424
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,385
就这样 我们跟你爸成了朋友
That's how we became friends with your dad.

425
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,355
好的
Okay.

426
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,498
你知道是弗朗茨吃了饼干
You know Franz ate the cookie.

427
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,375
- 以为人人有份? - 是啊
- Thought it was for everyone? - Yup.

428
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,420
我很确定街上那辆黑色轿车
I'm pretty sure that black sedan halfway down the street

429
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,130
刚才我们吃饭时也在餐馆外
was outside the diner, too.

430
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,675
美国每条街道上都有黑色轿车 上车
There's a black sedan on every street in America. Get in.

431
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,435
[engine starts]

432
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,481
- 经理说话了吗? - 没 我买通了门房
<i>[man on phone] Did the manager talk?</i>

433
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,522
Nah, I paid off the concierge.

434
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:40,068
他指认内格利以莎拉寇娜的名字 登记入住
He ID'd Neagley as checking in under the name Sarah Conner

435
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,863
并且用史达林卡斯楚的名字 支付了隔壁房间的费用
and, uh, paying for an adjoining room

436
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,946
using the name Starlin Castro.

437
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,573
一定是给大块头付的房费
That must be for the Hulk.

438
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:49,577
六七年前 史达林卡斯楚 曾效力于洋基队
Starlin Castro played for the Yankees, six or seven years ago.

439
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,454
对 莎拉寇娜是谁?
<i>[Saropian] And who's Sarah Conner?</i>

440
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,372
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

441
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,835
盯紧那家酒店还有他们
Just keep an eye on that hotel...

442
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:58,961
收到
and them.

443
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,837
<i>Copy that.</i>

444
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,093
[sighs]

445
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:12,350
三河咨询公司

446
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,436
对于跟华尔街生意人士 打交道的人来说 这很低调
[Neagley] Pretty modest for a guy with Wall Street business.

447
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,646
朴实无华
Unpretentious.

448
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,774
离家近 这样他能多陪陪家人
Close to home so he can spend more time with his family.

449
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,193
正是弗朗茨会选的地方
Exact kind of place Franzy would choose.

450
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,828
安吉拉说办公室“被毁了” 她没开玩笑
[Neagley] Angela wasn't kidding when she said trashed.

451
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,498
他们可能什么都没发现
They probably didn't find anything.

452
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,500
你怎么知道?
How do you know that?

453
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,170
如果你能马上找到需要的东西 就不会这么大费周章
You don't go to this length if you found

454
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,962
what you needed right away.

455
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,172
他们离开时很生气
And they left pissed.

456
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:49,554
他们没搜窗户后面 却用电话砸穿了
They weren't looking for anything

457
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,718
behind this glass window,

458
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,719
but they put that phone through it.

459
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,057
这是人没发现自己想找的东西时 沮丧的表现
That's an act of frustration

460
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,306
by someone who didn't find what they wanted.

461
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,517
他们想要的东西很小
Whatever they wanted was small.

462
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,354
若不是要找能塞进椅子腿的东西
You don't snap chair legs in half to see

463
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,315
你不会折断椅子腿 来看它是否是空心的
if they've been hollowed out unless you're looking

464
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,274
for something that can fit in there.

465
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,654
嘿
Hey.

466
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,782
看看这个
Check this out.

467
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,455
仿佛是昨天的事
Seems like yesterday.

468
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,137
钥匙链?
Keychain?

469
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,980
弗朗茨很机警 对吧?
Franz was sharp, right?

470
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,399
非常机警
Very sharp.

471
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,110
如果他要处理 可能会让自己丧命的东西
So if he was dealing with something

472
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,739
他必须把它放在一个 安全但很容易获取的地方
that could get him killed,

473
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,112
he'd have to put it in a place that was very secure,

474
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,739
but readily available.

475
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:52,200
我们每天都能见到
Somewhere in plain sight that we see every day,

476
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,452
但又不会引起别人怀疑的地方
but a place no one would suspect.

477
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,536
对
Okay.

478
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,830
所以什么地方是唾手可得
So what's a place that's readily available

479
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,875
可以将重要物品托付在那里的呢?
that we entrust every day with very important items?

480
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,003
这是邮箱钥匙
This is a mailbox key.

481
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,546
美国邮政服务

482
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,883
我有没有说过你很聪明 内格利?
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley?

483
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,218
还远远不够
Not nearly enough.

484
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,685
[rattling]

485
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,357
见鬼 已经五点过了
Shit. It's after 5:00.

486
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,861
如果是四位数密码 那有一万种组合
10,000 combinations if it's a four-number code.

487
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,988
- 尝试没有意义 - 很好
- No point in trying. - Good.

488
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,615
我很讨厌猜密码
Hate guessing passwords.

489
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,533
我们得明天再来
We'll have to come back tomorrow.

490
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,536
那我们现在干什么?
So, what do we do now?

491
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,707
金
- Gin. - [? Sonny Cleveland: "You've Got Me Running in Circles"]

492
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,418
我都不知道我为什么要玩
I don't even know why I play.

493
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,672
- 因为你抱着赢我的希望 - 我赢了几手牌
'Cause you hold out hope you'll beat me.

494
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,713
I won a few hands.

495
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,884
如果你放水 我会生气的
If you let me win, I'm gonna be pissed.

496
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,639
我不会放水 我会慢慢调整我的节奏
[laughs] I don't let you win.

497
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,597
I pace myself.

498
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,267
你的职业生涯可不是这样的
Not in your professional life.

499
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,310
我没听懂
Don't follow.

500
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:07,441
租的车是辆路虎揽胜 非常棒的酒店房间
Rental car's a Range Rover,

501
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,525
killer hotel rooms,

502
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,402
给我寄了机票 好像票不值钱一样
sent me airfare like it was nothing.

503
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,779
你事业很成功
- [cards riffling] - You're doing well.

504
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,825
很明显在你的职业生涯中 你没慢慢调整节奏
Clearly not pacing yourself in your professional life.

505
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:22,915
不是我吹牛 “少年得志” 这个词已经在我办公室传开了
Not to brag, but the term "wunderkind"

506
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,915
has been tossed around the office.

507
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,334
在过去的两年里 我两次升职
Two promotions in the past two years.

508
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,878
他们要在圣路易斯开一家分公司
They're opening a satellite office in St. Louis.

509
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,506
他们让我去当负责人
Offered me director if I wanted it.

510
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,093
但我太喜欢出外勤了
But I like being in the field too much.

511
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,011
出外勤做什么?
Doing what?

512
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,888
主要是给高收入人群
Mostly investigative work for high-income individuals.

513
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,517
政府机构、家族企业之类的 做调查工作
Government entities, family offices, that kind of thing.

514
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,396
我们偶尔会接一些无偿的案子
Once in a while we do a pro bono case.

515
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,773
找失踪的孩子、被盗的艺术品
Missing kids, stolen artwork...

516
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,193
所以这不仅仅是为了赚钱
So, it's not just about the money.

517
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,487
感觉很不错
It feels good.

518
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,031
你呢?
What about you?

519
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,160
不久前在苏福尔斯看了一场 小职业球队联盟的比赛
Saw a minor league game in Sioux Falls a while back.

520
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,369
真引人入胜
Riveting.

521
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,041
跟其他人一起看的?
See it with anyone else?

522
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,336
不是
No.

523
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,258
你在看比赛时跟任何人说话了吗?
Did you, uh...

524
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,301
talk to anyone at the game?

525
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,012
我点了杯啤酒
I ordered a beer.

526
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,598
好吧
Okay.

527
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,852
说到跟人说话
Speaking of talking to people,

528
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,939
你出去加油的时候 我又试着给大家打了电话
when you went out to get gas, I tried everyone again.

529
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,150
无线电静默
Radio silence.

530
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,486
你给谁打得最多?
Who'd you call the most?

531
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,530
桑切斯?奥罗斯科?奥唐纳?
Sanchez? Orozco? O'Donnell?

532
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,574
还是迪克森?
Or... Dixon?

533
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,285
她有接听应答服务
She has an answering service.

534
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,788
跟语音信箱不同 有人可以说话
Instead of leaving a voice mail,

535
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:47,625
对 因为我们刚发现 你有多喜欢跟人聊天
there's someone to actually talk to.

536
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,498
Right. 'Cause we just established

537
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,625
how much you like talking to people.

538
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,169
别说了
Shut up.

539
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,337
[soft laugh]

540
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:52,922
没关系
It's okay.

541
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,591
很明显你们俩对彼此都有好感
It was always obvious you guys had a thing for each other.

542
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,802
你们睡过了吗?
Did you ever sleep together?

543
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:58,928
没
No.

544
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,764
- 为什么? - 那样不合适
Why not?

545
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,099
你们是同一级别的
Wouldn't have been appropriate.

546
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,225
我负责管理团队
You were the same rank.

547
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,059
I ran the team.

548
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,603
不合适
Not appropriate.

549
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,314
<i>? Just keep going 'round, going 'round, 'round...</i>

550
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,941
但你觉得她很有魅力
But you found her attractive.

551
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,901
- 这不是有目共睹的事吗? - 我就不觉得
- Who wouldn't? - Me.

552
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,321
我没发现任何有魅力的人
I don't find anyone attractive.

553
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,364
金
Gin.

554
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:22,827
我要去睡觉了
- I'm going to bed. - [chuckles]

555
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,454
[Reacher grunts]

556
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:31,419
我会把房费、机票钱 还有所有费用都还给你
I'll pay you back for the room and flight and everything.

557
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,921
大约一周后我就能收到养老金了
I get my pension deposit in about a week.

558
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,172
不需要
[Neagley] Not necessary. I wouldn't have my career

559
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:39,260
如果我没被“雷彻学院”录取的话 就不会有现在的事业
if I hadn't matriculated at the School of Reacher.

560
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,845
就当是支付我拖欠的学费吧
Consider it past-due tuition.

561
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,347
没有我你也能建立一番事业
Something tells me you would've figured it out without me.

562
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:47,059
再说了 让我的军士长 替我付钱也很奇怪
Besides, it's a little weird

563
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,017
having my Master Sergeant carrying my tab.

564

00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:09,042
因为邮箱是落在他公司的名义下的
because the box was in his company's name.

707
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,961
我们应该去他办公室看看邮箱吗?
Should we check his office again for mail?

708
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,755
我们搜得很彻底了 那儿没有写着邮箱号码的东西
We were thorough. Nothing in there with a box number on it.

709
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,383
我们不能就这样进去试邮箱
We can't just go in there and start trying boxes.

710
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,012
他们会报警 而我们会被指控篡改邮件
They'll call the cops and we'll wind up

711
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,636
with federal mail tampering charges.

712
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,513
我们要全面考虑
Then let's think this through.

713
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,724
跟世界上89%的人一样 弗朗茨是右撇子
Like 89% of the world, Franz is right-handed,

714
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:26,143
所以他可能会要一个进门右边的邮箱
so he probably asked for a box on the right when you enter.

715
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,895
人们喜欢自己更顺手的一边
Humans favor their dominant side.

716
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,772
他会收到发给他的公共记录 监控照片
He gets public records sent to him,

717
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,858
所以他需要一个大号的箱子
surveillance photos, so he's gonna need one of the big boxes.

718
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,067
我会从这些信息开始查
I'll start with them, see which one's packed with mail

719
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,863
看看哪个箱子里面装满了邮件 因为他有段时间没拿了
since Franz hasn't made a pickup in a while.

720
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,531
我只需要你分散他人注意力
I just need a distraction.

721
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,117
收到
Copy that.

722
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,329
[door opens]

723
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,255
嘿 你还好吗 艾伯特?
Hey, how goes it... Albert?

724
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,507
我是个铁杆集邮迷
I am a hard-core philatelist

725
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,259
最近发行的这批邮票
and I have been fully aflutter about this new batch of stamps

726
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,595
让我非常激动

727
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:02,512
哪个系列的邮票?
- that were recently issued... - Which run?

728
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:07,142
我们有沙漠之花、州鸟和动漫世界
We've got, uh, Desert Flowers,

729
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,142
uh, State Birds and the World of Anime.

730
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,810
全部都很感兴趣
- All of 'em. - Oh.

731
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,230
我口袋里有苏珊硬币 我准备好花掉这些钱了
I've got a bunch of Susan Bs jingling in my pocket

732
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,439
and I'm ready to spend 'em.

733
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,316
好的
Um, okay.

734
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:19,029
至少有两打这样的卡通
There's at least two dozen of these, uh, cartoons.

735
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:22,574
不知道你熟不熟悉动漫 我觉得是日本的
If you're not familiar with anime, I believe it's Japanese.

736
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,867
好家伙
You don't say.

737
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,580
州鸟非常惊人
[Albert] Oh, and uh...

738
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,580
the State Birds are spectacular.

739
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,750
但永远都集不齐五十种
But never gonna get 50 different species.

740
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,128
西部草地鹨代表了六个不同的州
The Western Meadowlark represents six different states.

741
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,880
[Neagley] Oh.

742
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:41,843
不好意思 能让我开我的邮箱吗?
[elderly woman] Excuse me.

743
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:41,718
Excuse me. Can I get to my box?

744
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,470
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

745
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,475
先生 那是你的钥匙吗?
Sir, is that your key?

746
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:52,562
是的 我只是想不起来 哪个箱子是我的了
Yeah, I just... can't remember which box is mine.

747
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,273
先生 这个人在用不属于他的钥匙
Sir, this man is using a key that isn't his.

748
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,484
- 你是邮政警察吗? - 需要帮忙吗?
- What are you, the mail police? - Sir, can I help you?

749
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,528
- 之前邮件被偷过 - 能给我看看花的吗?
- Could you show me the Flowers, Al? - Sir.

750
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,154
- 先生? - 这里一切安好
All good here.

751
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,615
不 我需要您的身份证件 确保您是那个箱子的主人
No, sir, I'm gonna need some ID that ties you to that box.

752
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,659
我全都要 怎么样?
You know what? I'll take all of them.

753
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,244
好了!
How about that?

754
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,202
Here we go.

755
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:11,665
没事 我只是忘了是哪个箱子了
No problem.

756
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,415
Just got my boxes confused.

757
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,667
你知道怎么着 艾尔?算了吧
You know what, Al? I think I'll pass.

758
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,174
都是什么东西?
What do we got?

759
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,010
账单、请求
Bills, solicitations...

760
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,806
潜在线索
Potential.

761
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,022
看来你的“邮局直觉”是对的
Looks like your post office hunch worked.

762
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,898
我说过你很聪明吗 内格利?
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley?

763
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,067
- 还远远不够 - 我们得看看这里面有什么
Not nearly enough.

764
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,110
We need to see what's on this.

765
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,994
该死 我的笔记本的端口不同
Damn it. My laptop has a different port.

766
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,620
我得去拿个适配器
I got to go pick up an adapter.

767
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,207
帮我个忙 用手机软件叫辆出租车
[Reacher] Do me a favor.

768
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,915
Order up a ride on one of those phone app things.

769
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,667
我得借用你的车
I need to borrow your car.

770
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,296
你知道是这个U盘害死弗朗茨的
You know Franz was killed over this hard drive

771
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:00,839
现在你想去拿把枪
and now you want to go get a gun.

772
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,799
是的
Yup.

773
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,678
但首先 我需要去教堂
But first...

774
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,846
I need to go to church.

775
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:17,856
打扰一下
Excuse me.

776
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,193
我想知道我能否寻求帮助
I was wondering if I could ask for some help.

777
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,987
我们就是给人提供帮助的
Well, that is what we give here.

778
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,739
我在找我的表弟
I'm looking for my cousin.

779
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,365
他有很严重的吸毒问题
He has a really bad drug problem

780
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,118
一个朋友说看见他住在附近的街道上
and a family friend said they saw him

781
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,077
living on the street around here.

782
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,913
- 很遗憾听到这个消息 - 谢谢
I'm sorry to hear that.

783
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:36,208
我答应过姑姑 不带上她儿子就不回家
Well, thank you.

784
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,082
I promised my aunt I wouldn't come back home

785
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,251
我甚至都不知道从哪里开始找
without her son.

786
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,751
I don't know where to even begin looking.

787
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,922
我想也许教堂有个支持小组之类的
And I thought maybe the church

788
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,922
has a support group or something, and...

789
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:45,509
也许可以通过这种小组 了解吉米在哪里买的毒品
through that, maybe you'd have some idea

790
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,550
where Jimmy was scoring?

791
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,597
恶魔创造那种毒药的时候 已经尽了全力 不是吗?
The devil did his best work

792
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,597
when he created that poison, didn't he?

793
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,723
确实
Sure did.

794
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:55,102
几乎每个参加我们外展计划的人
Almost everyone who comes in to our outreach program

795
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:57,687
都是从同一个地方得到“慰藉”的
gets their fix from the same place:

796
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,232
那就是洛克威以东的杜蒙特
Dumont, just east of Rockaway.

797
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,694
但你一个人过去 简直是自寻死路 孩子
But you've got to have a death wish

798
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,694
to walk in there alone, son.

799
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,697
我会没事的 神父
I'll be fine, Father.

800

正义在我这边
I have righteousness on my side.

再多一点?
Little extra taste? I'll get you back tomorrow?

804
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,293
我明天会给你带回来
This ain't no furniture warehouse, man.

805
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,212
这不是家具仓库 伙计

806
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,630
我可不做“公益活动”
I don't do no credit. Get the fuck out of here

807
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,424
在我决定从沙发上起来前给我滚

我第一次听说无记名债券 是在《比佛利山庄警察》里
[forger] First time I heard about bearer bonds

843

was <i>Beverly Hills Cop.</i>

844

我不知道这是真的还是电影里杜撰的
I didn't know if they were real or Hollywood bullshit.

845
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:10,195
你可以为他们点亮一座灯塔 水印完好无损
You could shine a lighthouse on 'em, man.

846
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,195

00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,661
- [gasping] - [wheezing]

850
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,079
[coughs]

851
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,509
<i>[elevator bell dings]</i>

852
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:39,557
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

853
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,184
- 刚回来? - 是的
- Just getting back? - Yeah.

854
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,271
我不得不去了三家店 才买到我想要的东西 你呢?
Had to go to three stores to get what I needed. You?

855
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:47,274
- 一个地方就搞定了我要的所有东西 - 那可真好
Got everything I needed in one place.

856
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,315
Bet you did.

857
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,943
见鬼!
Oh, shit.

858
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,547
[clatter]

859
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,608
[grunting]

860
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,987
我看到你还在用铜指虎
[panting]

861
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,987
See you're still using brass knuckles.

862
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:35,196
不用弹簧刀了?
No more switchblade?

863
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,239
往下看
Look down.

864
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:39,784
嘿 奥唐纳
Hey, O'Donnell.

865
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,371
嘿 内格利
Hey, Neagley.

866
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,626
别指责我弄乱了房间 我发现时已经成这样了
Don't blame me for this shithole.

867
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,626
I found it like this.

868
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,214
我当时跟我家人在一起
I was with my family. It was, uh, Unplugged Week.

869
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:56,092
那周是不插电周

870
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,385
听起来很可怕
[Neagley] That sounds awful.

871
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,262
可不是嘛
[chuckles] No shit.

872
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:02,599
每年一次 我老婆给我们 在一个偏僻的地方租了一间小屋
Once a year, my wife makes us get a cabin

873
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:02,599
in the middle of nowhere,

874
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,560
没有手机 没有设备 没有电视
no cell phones, no devices, no TVs.

875
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,271
远离屏幕 亲近自然
Less screens, more greens.

876
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:12,609
理论上很好 但到了第三天 我的恶魔孩子们就想互相残杀
Good in theory, till by the third day

877
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:12,150
my devil children want to kill each other.

878
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,695
我回到家 检查了语音信箱 尽快赶到了这里
So, I got home, checked the voice mail,

879
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:15,695
got here as quick as I could.

880
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:19,616
那混蛋把我的牙刷折成了两半
Assholes snapped my toothbrush in half.

881
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,035
现在我一无所有了
Now I own nothing.

882
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,453
很高兴你没变
Glad to see you haven't changed.

883
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,038
你变了
You have. Family vacations.

884
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:28,124
家庭度假 老婆奴
Wife telling you what to do.

885
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,335
不是我记忆中性欲过剩的堕落者了
Not the oversexed degenerate I remember.

886
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,796
我被驯化了
I've been domesticated.

887
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,756
显然是的
Apparently.

888
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:41,096
我得说 弗朗茨的事让我很生气
Got to say, pretty pissed about this whole Franzy thing.

889
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,225
我很爱那孩子
Kind of loved that kid.

890
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,104
所以我们要杀谁呢?
So...

891
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,313
...who we killing over it?

892
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,027
你什么时候重回T台了?
When are you due back on the catwalk?

893
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,571
你看到你穿着跟那个无家可归的
God, you must've been mortified when you saw

894
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:02,075
在后面的咖啡罐里拉屎的人 一样的衣服一定觉得很羞愧吧
you were wearing the same clothes as the homeless guy

895
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,074
taking a shit in a coffee can out back.

896
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,159
见鬼!密码保护
Shit. Password protected.

897
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,703
- 我讨厌猜密码 - 即将更讨厌猜
Hate guessing passwords.

898
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,124
它已经设置好了 所以我们得在 两分钟内试三次 否则U盘会被删除
About to hate it more.

899
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,831
Franz set it up so we get three guesses in two minutes

900
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:11,126
它会随着新设备自动启动
or the drive's erased.

901
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:11,126
And it auto-launched once it recognized a new device.

902
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,669
- 你在搞我吧 - 没!
- You got to be shitting me. - [Neagley] Nope.

903
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,629
所以我们要像分析罪犯一样 分析弗朗茨
Okay, so we got to break Franzy down like we'd profile a perp.

904
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,631
密码来自于内心深处
Passwords come from deep down.

905
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,716
弗朗茨的特点是什么? 他因什么而出名?
What was Franzy's thing? What was he known for?

906
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,886
- 因聪明而出名 - 是啊 但我们都很聪明
Being smart.

907
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,886
[Reacher] Yeah, but we were all pretty smart.

908
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,013
匹兹堡?他总说起那里
Pittsburgh? That's all the guy talked about.

909
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:27,225
海盗队、钢人队 那家把薯条放在面上的三明治店
Pirates, Steelers, that, uh, that sandwich place

910
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,768
- 普利曼迪兄弟 - 对
where they put the fries on top.

911
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,309
- Primanti Brothers. - That was it.

912
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,105
不是匹兹堡本身 是他对它的忠诚
Yeah, but not Pittsburgh in and of itself.

913
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,272
It was his loyalty to it.

914
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,690
弗朗茨是个忠诚的人
Franz was a loyal guy.

915
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,818
这么多年来一直很喜欢110组 他还教他的孩子们我们的口号
Still loved the 110th after all these years,

916
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,609
taught his kid our slogan.

917
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,028
记得他声称1979年的海盗队
[O'Donnell] Do you remember when he used to claim

918
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,572
比1978年的洋基队更好
that the Pirates of '79 were better than the Yankees of '78?

919
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,783
他们比赛的时候 他都还没出生呢 而他还在那儿吵
I mean, the little shit wasn't even alive when those teams

920
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,744
但忠诚是个副产品 忠诚从何而来?
played and he'd still argue his ass off.

921
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,326
Okay, but loyalty is a byproduct.

922
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,872
英雄崇拜!尊重!
Where does it come from?

923
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,956
Hero worship. Respect. If Franz respected someone,

924
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,124
如果他尊重一个人 他就不会被旁人所左右
he couldn't be dissuaded.

925
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:54,377
海盗队是最厉害的队伍 迈尔斯戴维斯是最伟大的音乐家
Pirates were the greatest team ever.

926
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,377
Miles Davis was the greatest musician ever.

927
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,881
- 弗朗茨忠于他尊重的人和事 - 就是这个 你说对了
Franz was loyal to what he respected.

928
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,047
That's it. You got it.

929
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,592
罗伯特克莱门特
Roberto Clemente.

930
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,218
他会只用姓氏
He'd only use the last name.

931
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,097
等等!威利斯塔格尔呢?
Wait!

932
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,097
What about Willie Stargell?

933
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:10,727
威利斯塔格尔在给地震灾民 运送物资时死于飞机失事吗?
Did Willie Stargell die in a plane crash

934
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,226
delivering supplies to earthquake victims?

935
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:11,811
是克莱门特
It's Clemente.

936
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,105
不 不是
- [beeps] - No, it isn't.

937
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,318
- 谁会用这种设备? - 弗朗茨 正是因为这个原因
Who would use a device like this?

938
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,318
Franz. For this very reason.

939
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,737
我会试试迈尔斯戴维斯 弗朗茨很崇拜这家伙
I'm gonna try Miles Davis. Franz worshipped the guy.

940
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:23,364
很好的猜测 大胆试试吧
[Reacher] Good a guess as any. Go for it.

941
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,657
- 不对 - 见鬼
- [beeps] - Nope.

942
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,284
这就是为何我讨厌猜密码
[O'Donnell] Shit.

943
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,284
This is why I hate guessing passwords.

944
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,412
我很不想提出这个建议
Oh, this makes me sick to even suggest this,

945
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,498
走出这个房间 我会否认这种说法
and outside of this room I'll deny ever saying it,

946
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:35,126
但比起任何球员、艺术家 他最尊重的人是谁?
but who did Franz respect more than anyone?

947
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:35,126
Any ballplayer, any artist?

948
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,795
他崇拜的英雄是谁?
Who did he hero worship?

949
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,922
别添乱
Get the hell out of here.

950
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:41,549
进入110组的前几周 他剪了跟你一样的发型
A few weeks into the 110th, the kid started cutting

951
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,135
像你一样说话 跟着你 他想成为你
his hair like you, talking like you,

952
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,135
following you around. He wanted to be you, Reacher.

953
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,387
最好确认输入吧 我们时间不多了
You better punch that. We're running out of time.

954
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:50,058
[beeps]

955
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,684
[Reacher sighs]

956
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,686
王八蛋
Son of a bitch. [chuckles]

957
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:00,360
别自以为是
Don't go getting a big head.

958
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,740
[indistinct chatter]

959
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,991
是啊!

960
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:10,828
你好
Hello.

961
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:14,791
你想要这个吗?
Would you like this?

962
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,131
你知道我为何那么喜欢漫画书吗?
Now, do you know why I love comic books so much?

963
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,969
因为好人总能获胜
Because the good guys always win.

964
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,347
麦克布莱德先生 您预订了飞往丹佛的航班
[airline employee] Mr. McBride?

965
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,141
- 祝您旅途愉快 - 谢谢 一定会愉快的
You're booked for your flight to Denver.

966
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,515
Enjoy your trip.

967
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,725
Thank you. I certainly will.

968
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:39,357
姓名:安德鲁麦克布莱德

969
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:48,950
“安德鲁麦克布莱德 艾伦梅森 亚历杭德罗门蒂斯 亚历山大...”
Andrew McBride. Alan Mason.

970
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,366
Alejandro Mendez. Alexander Markopoulos.

971
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,661
只是一个名单 其中所有名字的首字母都是AM
Just a list of names, all starting with the initials A.M.

972
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:56,291
全是化名 你保留同样的首字母 这样你的签名永远都不会变
All aliases.

973
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:54,956
You keep the same initials so your signature

974
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:59,335
就一个“A”加一个带波浪线的“M” 无论化名具体是什么
never has to change.

975
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,875
Just an A and an M with a squiggle after it,

976
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,712
至少你那部分内容还能读出来
no matter which pseudonym you're using.

977
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,256
我刚得到的是一页又一页的随机数据
[O'Donnell] Well, at least you can read yours.

978
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,172
I've just got page after page of random numbers.

979
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:06,884
- 没有顺序 没有意义 什么都没 - 至少我们觉得没有 而且暂时而已
No order. No meaning. Nothing.

980
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,594
At least to us. For now.

981
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,179
无论这是什么 它害死了弗朗茨
Well, whatever this shit is,

982
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,349
还害得你们的房间被毁 天知道我们还不知道些什么
it was enough to get Franz killed, your rooms trashed,

983
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:13,349
and God knows whatever else we don't know about.

984
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,687
这些人可不会手软
[sighs]

985
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,353
These guys aren't shy about getting aggressive.

986
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,440
- 我们需要更多人力 - 我不愿承认 但他说得对
We need more manpower.

987
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,481
Hate to say it, but he's right.

988
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,109
110组的人都联系不上
None of the 110th are reachable.

989
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,987
我们每年都给斯旺寄圣诞贺卡
[O'Donnell] Well, we send a Christmas card

990
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,530
我想他现在住在皇后区
to Swan every year.

991
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,323
I think he lives in Queens now.

992
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,867
我会让莉莉查看我们的假期邮件列表
I'll have Lilly check our holiday mailer list.

993
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,749
- 怎么了? - 你真的被驯化了
What?

994
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,541
You really are domesticated.

995
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:44,464
[knocking]

996
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:53,556
里面没有任何噪音 一点纽约背景音乐?
No noise coming from inside.

997
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:54,182
A little New York background music?

998
00:48:57,352 --> 00:49:01,356
卡洛!你妈说你得回家吃饭!
Yo, Carlo! Your mom says you got to be home for dinner!

999
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,406
你们闻到了吗?
Oh. You smell that?

1000
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:13,660
我去楼上
I'll take the upstairs.

1001
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,139
[door opens]

1002
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:37,517
在这里
[O'Donnell coughs] In here.

1003
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,278
[flies buzzing]

1004
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,447
颈圈上写着:“麦丝”
[Neagley] Collar says Maisi.

1005
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,161
它把马桶水喝干了
Drank the toilet bowl dry.

1006
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:00,873
脱水而亡 这种死法太痛苦了
Dehydration. That's a tough way to die.

1007
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,835
斯旺永远不会让狗渴死
[Reacher] Swan would never let a dog die of thirst.

1008
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:07,046
如果他不回家 那只有一种可能
The only way he doesn't come home

1009
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,714
is if he couldn't come home.

1010
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:09,382
斯旺死了
Swan's dead.

1011
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:14,011
先是弗朗茨 现在是斯旺
Franzy, now Swan...

1012
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,390
我们也联系不上团队其他成员
We can't get ahold of the other team members, either.

1013
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:20,893
老大?
Boss?

1014
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:24,021
你有什么想法?
What are you thinking?

1015
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,068
少校?
Major?

1016
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:33,698
我觉得有人一心想干掉特别调查员
I'm thinking there's someone hellbent

1017
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:33,698
on taking out the Special Investigators.

1018
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:35,908
他们是冲我们来的
And they're coming after us.

1019
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:41,664
很好
Good.

1020
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,959
- [? The Stone Foxes: "I'm a King Bee"] - <i>? I'm a king bee ?</i>

1021
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:50,423
<i>? Buzzin' around your hive ?</i>

1022
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,055
<i>? Yeah, I'm a king bee ?</i>

1023
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:03,102
<i>? Buzzin' around your hive ?</i>

1024
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:11,652
<i>? Yeah, I can make honey ?</i>

1025
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:15,072
<i>? If you let me come inside ?</i>

1026
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,544
<i>? Yeah, I'm a king bee ?</i>

1027
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,716
<i>? Want you to be my queen ?</i>

1028
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,765
<i>? Yeah, I'm a king bee ?</i>

1029
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:45,686
<i>? Want you to be my queen ?</i>

1030
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,903
<i>? Together we can make honey ?</i>

1031
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:58,241
<i>? Like you ain't never seen ?</i>

1032
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,661
<i>? Like you've never seen ?</i>

1033
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,412
<i>? Hey ?</i>

1034
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,498
? ?

1035
