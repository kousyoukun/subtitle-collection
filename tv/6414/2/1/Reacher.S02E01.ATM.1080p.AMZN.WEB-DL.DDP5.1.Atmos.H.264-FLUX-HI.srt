before I could,
Angela reached out

242

Nothing but mucus
in his stomach.

Dehydrated. No food, no water.

Chucked out of a plane.

They didn't throw him
from a plane.

250

He was found in the middle
of nowhere with injuries

251
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,440
consistent with a fall
from 3,000 feet.

80 miles an hour? 100, tops?

254
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,706
They would've shoved him out
of the door's plane horizontally

255
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,740
into the slipstream.

256
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,320
He'd bang into the wing or tail.

257
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,570
There'd be perimortem injuries
and there aren't.

258
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:28,700
He was thrown from a helicopter.

259
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,830
His broken legs weren't
from the fall, anyway.

260
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:33,250
Because?

261
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,080
Look at his blood work.

262
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,840
Full of free histamines.
Massive pain reaction.

263

You don't get these kind
of levels from injuries

Broken legs were a few days old.

266

That's why ferrous oxide powder
was found in his pants fabric.

267
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:48,990
He was hit
with a rusty iron bar.

268

- Must've hurt like hell.
- Yep.

269
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:55,059
He was tortured for either
revenge or information.

270
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,036
When they were done with him,
they dumped him from the sky

271
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,399

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,129

she can't say where Dixon is
or when she'll return.

322
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,139
Probably an undercover job.

323

Maybe.

Or maybe they're all
in trouble, too.

I know he loved me and Mikey
more than anything,

but from the way he talked,
I don't think he ever

Ever since you guys
got together,

355
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,039

he seemed joyful.

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,250

357

Thank you f-for saying that.

358
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,039
I know the police have already
asked you a million questions,

359
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,480

walk us through the time line?

Sure. [sniffles]

361
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,970
I was away with Mikey in Provo,

362

helping my sister with our mom.

I tried Calvin for a few days,
and no return calls.

365
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,809
It's not like him,
so I started to worry.

366
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:50,019
Called NYPD, they just said
he could've been out

367
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,230
on a case because he was a PI

368
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,359
or maybe he was out partying

369
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,490
because his wife and kid
were out of town.

370
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,740
Do you think
that's what he was doing?

371
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,630
Out partying
with the wrong crowd?

372
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:08,119
Cal would call if he was gonna
be ten minutes late for dinner.

373
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,559
And he didn't party
with anybody.

374
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,339
So I got so worried,

375
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,180
I came back early
to find our home ransacked.

376
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,589
Nothing was taken.

377
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,599
The cops have no idea
who did it.

378
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,180
Were you aware of any cases
Franz may have been working on?

379
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,730
He never brought work home.

380
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,980
He said when he was here,

381
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,819
he wanted to be 100% present

382
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,170
for me, and Mikey.

383
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,200
I'm sorry. I want to help.

384
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,930
It's just so hard.

385
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,710
Every day hurts.

386
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,960
Just a few more questions.

387
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,349
Promise.

388
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,480
Okay.

389
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,519
What was his client base like?

390
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,720
Wall Street types.
CEOs, the hedge fund crowd.

391
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,259
Any of them particularly rough?

392
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,019
Causing him problems?
Stressing him out?

393
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,440
No. Not at all.
Once Mikey came along,

394
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,700
he stopped doing
the dangerous jobs.

395
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,210
Or so I thought.

396
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,829
Were any other members of
the 110th working with him?

397
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,420
I don't know. Maybe there's
something in his office.

398
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,910
Sign on the door is Three Rivers
Consulting and Associates.

399
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,460
It's 103 Flatbush.
It was trashed, too.

400
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,135
The cops couldn't find
anything there,

401
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,130
but from what Franzy
always told me,

402
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:38,859
the Special Investigators
weren't any old group of cops.

403
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,529
You do not mess with
the Special Investigators.

404
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,579
Your daddy teach you that?

405
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:04,920
Do you want to know how your dad
became a Special Investigator?

406
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,579
He stopped a fight
between two huge soldiers

407
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,750
because one of them thought
the other had stolen

408
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,480
the last homemade cookie
sent to him from his mom.

409
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:21,069
Your dad got them to shake hands
and be friends again.

410
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,759
And this guy, right here,

411
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,490
he wanted your dad to be
part of the 110th because...

412
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,410
he saw a man who stayed cool
when things got heated.

413
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,880
That's how we became friends
with your dad.

414
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,390
Okay.

415
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:12,599
You know Franz ate the cookie.

416
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,269
- Thought it was for everyone?
- Yup.

417
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,276
I'm pretty sure that black sedan
halfway down the street

418
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:19,069
was outside the diner, too.

419
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:22,750
There's a black sedan on every
street in America. Get in.

Nah, I paid off the concierge.

423
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,289
He ID'd Neagley as checking in
under the name Sarah Conner

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,460
and, uh, paying
for an adjoining room

using the name Starlin Castro.

That must be for the Hulk.

427
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,549
Starlin Castro played for the

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,619
Unpretentious.

Close to home so he can
spend more time with his family.

437

Exact kind of place
Franzy would choose.

[Neagley] Angela wasn't kidding

How do you know that?

You don't go to this length

what you needed right away.

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,746
They weren't looking

behind this glass window,

446
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,700
but they put that phone
through it.

447
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,490
That's an act of frustration

448

by someone who didn't find
what they wanted.

449

Whatever they wanted was small.

450
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,619
You don't snap chair legs
in half to see

451
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,175
if they've been hollowed out

452
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,309
for something
that can fit in there.

453
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,730
Hey.

454
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,819
Check this out.

455
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,700
Seems like yesterday.

456
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,210
Keychain?

457
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,130
Franz was sharp, right?

458
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,460
Very sharp.

459
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,806
So if he was dealing
with something

460
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,130
that could get him killed,

461
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,266
he'd have to put it in a place
that was very secure,

but readily available.

463

Somewhere in plain sight
that we see every day,

464

but a place
no one would suspect.

465

Okay.

466
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,519
So what's a place
that's readily available

467
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,910
that we entrust every day
with very important items?

468
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,329
This is a mailbox key.

killed, your rooms trashed,

957
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,329
and God knows whatever else
we don't know about.

958
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,539
[sighs]

959
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:17,329
These guys aren't shy
about getting aggressive.

960
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,619
We need more manpower.

961
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,519
Hate to say it, but he's right.

962
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,090
None of the 110th are reachable.

963
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:24,885
[O'Donnell] Well,
we send a Christmas card

964
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:26,340
to Swan every year.

965
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,300
I think he lives in Queens now.

966
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,150
I'll have Lilly check
our holiday mailer list.

967
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,030
What?

968
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,579
You really are domesticated.

969
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
[knocking]

970
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,869
No noise coming from inside.

971
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:54,219
A little New York
background music?

972
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,429
Yo, Carlo! Your mom says
you got to be home for dinner!

973
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,610
Oh. You smell that?

974
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,400
I'll take the upstairs.

975
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,119
[door opens]

976
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,800
[O'Donnell coughs] In here.

977
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:49,260
[flies buzzing]

978
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,820
[Neagley] Collar says Maisi.

979
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,309
Drank the toilet bowl dry.

980
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,599
Dehydration.
That's a tough way to die.

981
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,809
[Reacher] Swan would never
let a dog die of thirst.

982
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,235
The only way
he doesn't come home

983
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,690
is if he couldn't come home.

984
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:09,460
Swan's dead.

985
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,159
Franzy, now Swan...

986
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,469
We can't get ahold of
the other team members, either.

987
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,599
Boss?

988
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:25,059
What are you thinking?

989
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,000
Major?

990
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:31,130
I'm thinking
there's someone hellbent

991
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,679
on taking out
the Special Investigators.

992
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:36,320
And they're coming after us.

993
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,599
Good.

994
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,119
