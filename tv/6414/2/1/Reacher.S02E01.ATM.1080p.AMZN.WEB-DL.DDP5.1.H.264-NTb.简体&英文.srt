你觉得我们真能一起工作
You think we're actually gonna be able to work together?

134
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
腿用力 抬起来

135
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,410
我不知道
No idea.

136
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,380
但我可以请大家喝酒
But I could use a beer.

137
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,550
跟他们说我买单
Tell them I'm buying.

138
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,220
威廉斯堡 纽约布鲁克林

139
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,630
雷彻
Reacher.

140
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,750
内格利
Neagley.

141
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,720
谢谢你点餐 杯子里还冒着热气
Thanks for ordering. Still steam coming off the cup.

142
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,640
我在网上追踪了航班信息 看到它提前落地了
Tracked the plane online, saw it landed early,

143
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,180
你不托运行李 我算了通勤时间
you don't check bags and I adjusted for traffic.

144
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,850
90秒前倒的咖啡
Had the coffee poured 90 seconds ago.

145
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,520
食物已经上桌三分钟了
Food's been there three minutes.

146
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,730
非常感谢
Appreciated.

147
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
这是从哪儿弄到的
Where'd you get this?

148
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,190
我是私家侦探 能搜集到这些东西
I'm a PI. I can get things.

149
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,820
距离马格雷夫一别有些时日了
Been a minute since Margrave.

150
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,870
是两年七个月19天
Been two years, seven months, 19 days.

151
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,200
你气色不错
You look good.

152
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,080
我看起来没变化
I look the same.

153
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,630
跟两年七个月19天前一样好
You looked good two years, seven months, 19 days ago,

154
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,710
所以你看起来也一样
so, yeah. You look the same.

155
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,670
你看起来鞍马劳顿
You look... road-worn.

156
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,840
是啊
Yep.

157
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,640
那么 弗朗茨 给我讲讲大体情况
So, Franz. Give me the Cliff Notes.

158
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,020
大约一周前 他离家后失踪了
Went missing after leaving his home in Brooklyn about a week or so ago.

159
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,390
尸体被发现于卡兹奇山
Body was found in the Catskill Mountains.

160
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,440
整个警察局有20名警察
Whole force up there is, like, 20 cops.

161
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,520
弗朗茨在城里失踪后 纽约市警察局开始牵头调查
And since Franz disappeared in the city, NYPD's taking the lead.

162
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,440
- 你是怎么知道的  - 安吉拉给我打了电话
How'd you find out? Got a call from Angela.

163
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,780
- 弗朗茨的遗孀 - 弗朗茨结婚了
Franzy's widow.  Franz was married?

164
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,990
是啊 很有趣的婚礼 还有巧克力喷泉
Yeah. Fun wedding. Chocolate fountain.

165
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,450
他还有个儿子
He had a son, too.

166
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,460
怎么了 大块头 你不在的时候 生活还在继续
What? Life moves on when you're away, big fella.

167
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,500
还有什么消息
What else?

168
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,260
他失踪前几天给我留了几条信息
Franz left me a few messages in the days before his disappearance.

169
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,720
想从我这里了解一些 他正在追查的案件的信息
Said he wanted to bounce some stuff off of me about a case he was chasing down.

170
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,100
我当时忙着做自己的工作 我一直想回去找他来着
I was so tied up with my own work, I kept meaning to get back to him, but...

171
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,730
但在我找他之前 安吉拉联系我 说他被杀了
before I could, Angela reached out and told me he'd been murdered.

172
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,860
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

173
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,490
- 我知道 - 他不仅仅是被谋杀
- I know. - He wasn't just murdered.

174
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,280
还受到了折磨
He was tortured.

175
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,780
他的胃里只有粘液 脱水了 没有食物 没有水
Nothing but mucus in his stomach. Dehydrated. No food, no water.

176
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,030
他被扔出了飞机
Chucked out of a plane.

177
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,790
他们不可能是把他扔下飞机的
They didn't throw him from a plane.

178
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,120
他的尸体被发现于荒无人烟的地方
He was found in the middle of nowhere with injuries

179
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,460
受伤情况跟从一公里的高处 坠落的伤口相吻合
consistent with a fall from 3,000 feet.

180
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,960
飞机的失速速度是多少来着  每小时130公里 最高160公里
An airplane has a stall speed of what? 80 miles an hour? 100, tops?

181
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,920
他们会垂直把他扔到气流中
They would've shoved him out of the door's plane horizontally into the slipstream.

182
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,340
他会撞到机翼或机尾
He'd bang into the wing or tail.

183
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,970
那样会造成死前伤口 但他身上没有
There'd be perimortem injuries and there aren't.

184
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,680
他是被从直升机上扔下来的
He was thrown from a helicopter.

185
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,770
- 他的腿骨折不是坠地造成的 - 此话怎讲
His broken legs weren't from the fall, anyway. Because?

186
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,230
看他的血液检查结果
Look at his blood work.

187
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,850
充满了游离组胺 这反映出了剧烈的疼痛反应
Full of free histamines. Massive pain reaction.

188
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,690
直到死前 游离组胺的含量都极高
You don't get these kind of levels from injuries sustained at the time of death.

189
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,070
断腿是几天前的事
Broken legs were a few days old.

190
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,070
因此 在他裤子的布料中 发现了氧化亚铁粉
That's why ferrous oxide powder was found in his pants fabric.

191
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,910
他曾被一根生锈的铁棒击中
He was hit with a rusty iron bar.

192
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
一定疼死了
Must've hurt like hell.

193
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,410
是啊 他要么是因为报复而被折磨 要么是因为情报
Yep. He was tortured for either revenge or information.

194
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,670
凶手得手以后 把他从空中丢出 避免了使用枪支
When they were done with him, they dumped him from the sky to avoid ballistics.

195
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,250
几个大学生在徒步的时候 发现了尸体
Couple of college kids wandered off their hiking trail, saw the body.

196
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,550
否则谁知道他什么时候才会被发现
If not for them, who knows when he would've been found?

197
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,720
那么 接下来呢
So, next steps?

198
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,640
如果他给你打过电话 那他可能也给队里其他人打过
If he was calling you for help, he may have been trying to get in touch with the rest of the unit.

199
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,140
大概是失败了
Probably failed.

200
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,810
我给奥唐纳 迪克森 桑切斯和奥罗斯科打了电话
I called O'Donnell, Dixon, Sanchez and Orozco.

201
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,400
都没人接
No one's answering.

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,110
斯旺没有登记电话号码 连我的办公室都找不到他的电话
No listed number for Swan. Even my office can't find it.

203
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,450
他总是非常注重隐私 劳莱呢
Always a private guy. What about Lowrey?

204
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,990
他两年前死于蒙大拿的一场车祸
Killed two years ago in a car accident in Montana.

205
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,450
葬礼非常伤感 但很高兴再次见到这伙人
Funeral was sad, but... it was good to see the gang again.

206
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,420
我猜你不在的时候 有些人也走向了终点
Guess life ends when you're away, too.

207
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,550
弗朗茨的婚礼 劳莱的葬礼 全都没人告诉我
Franz's wedding, Lowrey's funeral. No one told me.

208
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,090
没有电话 没有地址
No phone, no address.

209
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,800
你本来可以像今天一样 给我发一条紧急取款机信息
You could've sent me an emergency ATM message like today.

210
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,090
首先 我刚想到这个方法
First off, I just thought of that.

211
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,760
其次 那也不是紧急情况
Second, it wasn't really an emergency.

212
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,060
紧急的是卡车撞上劳莱的那一刻
The emergency was the moment the pickup hit Lowrey.

213
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,020
而且说实话 你真的愿意 大老远地从德州或缅因州
And be honest, would you really have travelled all the way to Montana

214
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,810
或你当时所在的地方赶到蒙大拿
from Texas or Maine or wherever you were at the time

215
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,360
就为了看一眼盒子里的尸体
just to look at a body in a box?

216
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,900
不愿意
No.

217
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,620
那我再问一次 接下来呢
So I'll ask again. Next steps?

218
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,750
你真的想让其他警察 去处理我们死去的朋友的案子
You really want to let some other cops handle our dead friend's case?

219
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,170
我也这么想
That's what I thought.

220
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,050
我们去见见弗朗茨的遗孀吧
Let's go see Franzy's widow.

221
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,790
她刚跟大块头见了面
She just met up with the big one.

222
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,460
我是大卫奥唐纳 我现在不在
You've reached David O'Donnell. I'm not around;

223
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,550
请留言 我会回电
leave a message. I'll call you back.

224
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,890
奥唐纳 我是雷彻 现在急需帮忙
O'Donnell. This is Reacher with another 10-30.

225
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,930
内格利和我住在布鲁克林的瓦尔酒店
Neagley and I are staying at the Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.

226
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,100
快行动 给我们回电
Get off your ass and call us back.

227
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,310
我们没法给斯旺打电话
So, we can't call Swan.

228
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,650
奥唐纳 桑切斯和奥罗斯科 还是不接电话
O'Donnell, Sanchez and Orozco still don't answer.

229
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,480
迪克森办公室的接待员
And the receptionist at Dixon's office says

230
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,280
说她不知道她在哪儿 也不知道她何时回来
she can't say where Dixon is or when she'll return.

231
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,450
可能是在做卧底工作
Probably an undercover job.

232
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,530
也许吧
Maybe.

233
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,740
也许他们也遇到麻烦了
Or maybe they're all in trouble, too.

234
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,890
米奇 去拿你的蜡笔 玩填色游戏 好吗
Mikey. Go find your crayons and do some coloring time, okay?

235
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,020
请坐
Please sit.

236
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,320
抱歉我过了这么久才脱身
Sorry it took me so long to disengage.

237
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,950
让我姐姐挂断电话很难
It's just hard to get my sister off the phone.

238
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,530
她每小时打一次电话 是我的个人自杀督查表
She calls every hour. My own personal suicide watch.

239
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,960
抱歉 那是种病 我不应该说那话
Sorry. That was, uh, morbid. I shouldn't have said that.

240
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
你经历了那些事 想说什么都行
After what you've been through, you can say whatever you want.

241
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,220
你的儿子竟然长得那么像弗朗茨
Can't believe how much your son looks like Franzy.

242
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
我也叫他弗朗茨
I called him Franzy, too.

243
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,020
是你们中的哪个 给他起的名字来着 我忘了
Which one of you gave him that name again? I forgot.

244
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,020
奥唐纳
O'Donnell.

245
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,900
对 大卫奥唐纳
Right. David O'Donnell.

246
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
他曾经叫你“大块头”
And he used to call you The Big Guy.

247
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,780
我的天啊 卡尔文 给我讲过你们所有人的故事
My God, did Calvin ever tell me stories about you all.

248
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,700
我知道他爱我和米奇胜过一切
I know he loved me and Mikey more than anything,

249
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,080
但从他说话的方式来看 我觉得他更享受
but from the way he talked, I don't think he ever ad any more fun

250
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,240
他在110组里度过的时光
than his years spent with the 110th.

251
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,290
这可说不准 自从你们在一起后
I don't know about that. Ever since you guys got together,

252
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,080
每当我跟他聊天时 他看上去都很高兴
whenever I talked to him, he seemed joyful.

253
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,170
比我认识的他更加高兴
Happier than I ever knew him.

254
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,680
谢谢你这么说
Thank you f-for saying that.

255
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,350
我知道警方已经问过你一大堆问题了
I know the police have already asked you a million questions,

256
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,190
但你能讲讲时间线吗
but do you think you could walk us through the time line?

257
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,570
当然
Sure.

258
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,360
我当时跟米奇在普洛佛
I was away with Mikey in Provo,

259
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,240
帮姐姐照顾我们的妈妈
helping my sister with our mom.

260
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,450
她有早发性痴呆
Early-onset dementia.

261
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,580
我试着联系了卡尔文几天 但他没有回电话
I tried Calvin for a few days, and no return calls.

262
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,830
这不像他的作风 所以我开始担心
It's not like him, so I started to worry.

263
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,830
我给纽约警局打电话
Called NYPD,

264
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,210
他们说他可能是出去查案子了 因为他是一名私家侦探
they just said he could've been out on a case because he was a PI

265
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,510
或者他可能出去参加派对了 因为他的老婆和孩子不在
or maybe he was out partying because his wife and kid were out of town.

266
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,550
你觉得他是去做那事了吗  出去跟损友聚会
Do you think that's what he was doing? Out partying with the wrong crowd?

267
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,480
卡尔文连晚餐迟到十分钟 都会给我打电话
Cal would call if he was gonna be ten minutes late for dinner.

268
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,440
他不会跟别人参加派对
And he didn't party with anybody.

269
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,190
所以我很担心 我提早回来 发现我们家被搜了个遍
So I got so worried, I came back early to find our home ransacked.

270
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,610
什么都没被拿走
Nothing was taken.

271
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,700
警察不知道是谁干的
The cops have no idea who did it.

272
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
你知道他可能在查什么案子吗
Were you aware of any cases Franz may have been working on?

273
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,490
他从不把工作带回家
He never brought work home.

274
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,920
他说他在家的时候
He said when he was here,

275
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,500
希望把百分之百的心思花在我
he wanted to be 100% present for me,

276
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,090
还有米奇身上
and Mikey.

277
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,220
对不起
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,890
我想帮忙 这太难了
I want to help. It's just so hard.

279
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,720
每天都很痛苦
Every day hurts.

280
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,310
再问几个问题 我保证就几个
Just a few more questions. Promise.

281
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
好的
Okay.

282
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,480
他的客户群是什么样的
What was his client base like?

283
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,740
华尔街那种 首席执行官 对冲基金人群
Wall Street types. CEOs, the hedge fund crowd.

284
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,990
有特别难搞的客户吗  给他带来麻烦的 让他压力很大的
Any of them particularly rough? Causing him problems? Stressing him out?

285
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,540
一个都没有
No. Not at all. Once Mikey came along,

286
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,790
米奇一出生 他就不再做危险的工作了
he stopped doing the dangerous jobs.

287
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,130
现在看来并非如此
Or so I thought.

288
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,800
他跟110组的其他人有合作吗
Were any other members of the 110th working with him?

289
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,380
我不知道 也许他的办公室里有什么线索
I don't know. Maybe there's something in his office.

290
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,970
门上的招牌是三河咨询公司
Sign on the door is Three Rivers Consulting and Associates.

291
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,560
在弗拉特布什103号
It's 103 Flatbush. It was trashed, too.

292
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,980
办公室也被毁了 警察在那里一无所获
The cops couldn't find anything there,

293
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,690
但弗朗茨总是告诉我
but from what Franzy always told me,

294
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,820
特别调查员不是普通的警察
the Special Investigators weren't any old group of cops.

295
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,910
不要惹特别调查员
You do not mess with the Special Investigators.

296
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,540
你爸教你的
Your daddy teach you that?

297
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,430
你想知道你爸 是怎么成为特别调查员的吗
Do you want to know how your dad became a Special Investigator?

298
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,560
他阻止了两个大块头士兵之间的打斗
He stopped a fight between two huge soldiers

299
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,470
因为其中一人以为
because one of them thought the other had stolen

300
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,560
另一个人偷了他妈妈给他的 饼干盒里的最后一块自制饼干
the last homemade cookie sent to him from his mom.

301
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,650
你爸爸让他们握手言和 再次成为朋友
Your dad got them to shake hands and be friends again.

302
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,780
而这里的这个人
And this guy, right here,

303
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,780
他想让你爸爸加入110组 因为...
he wanted your dad to be part of the 110th because...

304
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,830
他发现了一个能在情况激烈时 保持冷静的人
...he saw a man who stayed cool when things got heated.

305
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,380
就这样 我们跟你爸成了朋友
That's how we became friends with your dad.

306
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,350
好的
Okay.

307
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,490
你知道是弗朗茨吃了饼干
You know Franz ate the cookie.

308
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,370
- 以为人人有份  - 是啊
- Thought it was for everyone? - Yup.

309
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,420
我很确定街上那辆黑色轿车
I'm pretty sure that black sedan halfway down the street

310
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,130
刚才我们吃饭时也在餐馆外
was outside the diner, too.

311
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,670
美国每条街道上都有黑色轿车 上车
There's a black sedan on every street in America. Get in.

312
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,480
- 经理说话了吗  - 没 我买通了门房
Did the manager talk? Nah, I paid off the concierge.

313
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,060
他指认内格利以莎拉寇娜的名字 登记入住
He ID'd Neagley as checking in under the name Sarah Conner

314
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,860
并且用史达林卡斯楚的名字 支付了隔壁房间的费用
and, uh, paying for an adjoining room using the name Starlin Castro.

315
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,570
一定是给大块头付的房费
That must be for the Hulk.

316
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,570
六七年前 史达林卡斯楚 曾效力于洋基队
Starlin Castro played for the Yankees, six or seven years ago.

317
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,450
对 莎拉寇娜是谁
And who's Sarah Conner?

318
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,370
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

319
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,830
盯紧那家酒店还有他们
Just keep an eye on that hotel... and them.

320
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,960
收到
Copy that.

321
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,350
三河咨询公司

322
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,430
对于跟华尔街生意人士 打交道的人来说 这很低调
Pretty modest for a guy with Wall Street business.

323
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,640
朴实无华
Unpretentious.

324
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,770
离家近 这样他能多陪陪家人
Close to home so he can spend more time with his family.

325
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,190
正是弗朗茨会选的地方
Exact kind of place Franzy would choose.

326
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,820
安吉拉说办公室“被毁了” 她没开玩笑
Angela wasn't kidding when she said trashed.

327
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,490
他们可能什么都没发现
They probably didn't find anything.

328
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,500
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

329
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,170
如果你能马上找到需要的东西 就不会这么大费周章
You don't go to this length if you found what you needed right away.

330
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,170
他们离开时很生气
And they left pissed.

331
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,550
他们没搜窗户后面 却用电话砸穿了
They weren't looking for anything behind this glass window, but they put that phone through it.

332
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,050
这是人没发现自己想找的东西时 沮丧的表现
That's an act of frustration by someone who didn't find what they wanted.

333
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,510
他们想要的东西很小
Whatever they wanted was small.

334
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,350
若不是要找能塞进椅子腿的东西
You don't snap chair legs in half to see

335
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,310
你不会折断椅子腿 来看它是否是空心的
if they've been hollowed out unless you're looking for something that can fit in there.

336
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,650
嘿
Hey.

337
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,780
看看这个
Check this out.

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,450
仿佛是昨天的事
Seems like yesterday.

339
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,130
钥匙链
Keychain?

340
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,980
弗朗茨很机警 对吧
Franz was sharp, right?

341
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,390
非常机警
Very sharp.

342
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,110
如果他要处理 可能会让自己丧命的东西
So if he was dealing with something that could get him killed,

343
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,730
他必须把它放在一个 安全但很容易获取的地方
he'd have to put it in a place that was very secure, but readily available.

344
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,200
我们每天都能见到
Somewhere in plain sight that we see every day,

345
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,450
但又不会引起别人怀疑的地方
but a place no one would suspect.

346
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,530
对
Okay.

347
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,830
所以什么地方是唾手可得
So what's a place that's readily available

348
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,870
可以将重要物品托付在那里的呢
that we entrust every day with very important items?

349
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,000
这是邮箱钥匙
This is a mailbox key.

350
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,540
美国邮政服务

351
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,880
我有没有说过你很聪明 内格利
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley?

352
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,210
还远远不够
Not nearly enough.

353
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,350
见鬼 已经五点过了
Shit. It's after 5:00.

354
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,860
如果是四位数密码 那有一万种组合
10,000 combinations if it's a four-number code.

355
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,980
- 尝试没有意义 - 很好
- No point in trying. - Good.

356
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,610
我很讨厌猜密码
Hate guessing passwords.

357
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,530
我们得明天再来
We'll have to come back tomorrow.

358
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,530
那我们现在干什么
So, what do we do now?

359
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
金
Gin.

360
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,410
我都不知道我为什么要玩
I don't even know why I play.

361
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,670
- 因为你抱着赢我的希望 - 我赢了几手牌
'Cause you hold out hope you'll beat me. I won a few hands.

362
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,880
如果你放水 我会生气的
If you let me win, I'm gonna be pissed.

363
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,630
我不会放水 我会慢慢调整我的节奏
I don't let you win. I pace myself.

364
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,260
你的职业生涯可不是这样的
Not in your professional life.

365
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,310
我没听懂
Don't follow.

366
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,440
租的车是辆路虎揽胜 非常棒的酒店房间
Rental car's a Range Rover, killer hotel rooms,

367
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,400
给我寄了机票 好像票不值钱一样
sent me airfare like it was nothing.

368
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,770
你事业很成功
You're doing well.

369
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,820
很明显在你的职业生涯中 你没慢慢调整节奏
Clearly not pacing yourself in your professional life.

370
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,910
不是我吹牛 “少年得志” 这个词已经在我办公室传开了
Not to brag, but the term "wunderkind" has been tossed around the office.

371
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,330
在过去的两年里 我两次升职
Two promotions in the past two years.

372
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,870
他们要在圣路易斯开一家分公司
They're opening a satellite office in St. Louis.

373
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,500
他们让我去当负责人
Offered me director if I wanted it.

374
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,090
但我太喜欢出外勤了
But I like being in the field too much.

375
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,010
出外勤做什么
Doing what?

376
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,880
主要是给高收入人群
Mostly investigative work for high-income individuals.

377
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,510
政府机构 家族企业之类的 做调查工作
Government entities, family offices, that kind of thing.

378
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,390
我们偶尔会接一些无偿的案子
Once in a while we do a pro bono case.

379
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,770
找失踪的孩子 被盗的艺术品
Missing kids, stolen artwork...

380
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,190
所以这不仅仅是为了赚钱
So, it's not just about the money.

381
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,480
感觉很不错
It feels good.

382
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
你呢
What about you?

383
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,160
不久前在苏福尔斯看了一场 小职业球队联盟的比赛
Saw a minor league game in Sioux Falls a while back.

384
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,360
真引人入胜
Riveting.

385
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,040
跟其他人一起看的
See it with anyone else?

386
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,330
不是
No.

387
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,250
你在看比赛时跟任何人说话了吗
Did you, uh... talk to anyone at the game?

388
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,010
我点了杯啤酒
I ordered a beer.

389
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,590
好吧
Okay.

390
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,850
说到跟人说话
Speaking of talking to people,

391
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,930
你出去加油的时候 我又试着给大家打了电话
when you went out to get gas, I tried everyone again.

392
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,150
无线电静默
Radio silence.

393
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,480
你给谁打得最多
Who'd you call the most?

394
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,530
桑切斯 奥罗斯科 奥唐纳
Sanchez? Orozco? O'Donnell?

395
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,570
还是迪克森
Or... Dixon?

396
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,280
她有接听应答服务
She has an answering service.

397
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,780
跟语音信箱不同 有人可以说话
Instead of leaving a voice mail, there's someone to actually talk to.

398
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,620
对 因为我们刚发现 你有多喜欢跟人聊天
Right. 'Cause we just established how much you like talking to people.

399
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
别说了
Shut up.

400
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
没关系
It's okay.

401
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,590
很明显你们俩对彼此都有好感
It was always obvious you guys had a thing for each other.

402
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,800
你们睡过了吗
Did you ever sleep together?

403
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
没
No.

404
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,760
- 为什么  - 那样不合适
Why not? Wouldn't have been appropriate.

405
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,090
你们是同一级别的
You were the same rank.

406
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,220
我负责管理团队
I ran the team.

407
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,600
不合适
Not appropriate.

408
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,940
但你觉得她很有魅力
But you found her attractive.

409
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,900
- 这不是有目共睹的事吗  - 我就不觉得
- Who wouldn't? - Me.

410
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,320
我没发现任何有魅力的人
I don't find anyone attractive.

411
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,360
金
Gin.

412
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
我要去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

413
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,410
我会把房费 机票钱 还有所有费用都还给你
I'll pay you back for the room and flight and everything.

414
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,920
大约一周后我就能收到养老金了
I get my pension deposit in about a week.

415
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,170
不需要
Not necessary.

416
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,260
如果我没被“雷彻学院”录取的话 就不会有现在的事业
I wouldn't have my career if I hadn't matriculated at the School of Reacher.

417
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,840
就当是支付我拖欠的学费吧
Consider it past-due tuition.

418
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,340
没有我你也能建立一番事业
Something tells me you would've figured it out without me.

419
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,050
再说了 让我的军士长 替我付钱也很奇怪
Besides, it's a little weird having my Master Sergeant carrying my tab.

420
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,390
我会还你的
I'll get us square.

421
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,100
- 晚安 内格利 - 晚安 雷彻
- Night, Neagley. - Night, Reacher.

422
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,870
给您 这是给您的
For you. Here you go.

423
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,910
- 请慢用 - 谢谢
Enjoy. Thank you.

424
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,930
好吧 敬一群活泼的人
Well, here's to a lively bunch.

425
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,930
你应该把你的班卓琴拿来
Should've brought your banjo.

426
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,100
等喝完这一轮 我要回会计部了
Well, I think after this round, I'm gonna head back to Accounting.

427
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,400
我还得完成一些文书工作
Still have some paperwork I need to finish.

428
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,980
但我们刚到这里
But we just got here.

429
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,280
我知道
I know.

430
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,660
如果您不介意我问的话 是谁派您来带这个小组的 长官
If you don't mind me asking, who directed you to field this team, sir?

431
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,370
我不介意你问 但我介意你叫我“长官”
I don't mind you asking. I do mind you calling me "sir."

432
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,130
您的级别比我高
You outrank me.

433
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,000
你是军士长 几乎每个人的级别都比你高
You're a Master Sergeant. Almost everyone outranks you.

434
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,420
你们不应该穿着制服喝酒
You're not supposed to be drinking in uniform.

435
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,680
我们没喝酒
We're not drinking.

436
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,550
我们之前在喝酒 但然后你打断了我们
We were drinking. Then you interrupted us.

437
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,310
她不属于这里
She doesn't belong here.

438
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,310
这里是军队 我们中有人属于这里吗
It's the Army. Do any of us really belong here?

439
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,020
- 你算是个聪明人吧  - 比你聪明
You some kind of smart guy? Smarter than you.

440
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,480
我也是个有规矩的人
I'm also a man with a rule.

441
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,110
人不犯我 我不犯人
People leave me and my pals alone, I leave them alone.

442
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,780
人若犯我 我必犯人
They don't, I don't.

443
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,240
我以为他的规矩是“一旦 打出第一枪 计划就见鬼去吧”
I thought his rule was plans go to hell when the first shot's fired.

444
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,700
这是军官俱乐部 不是给现役军人的
It's an officers' club. No enlisted.

445
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,120
我喝完啤酒就走 好吗 长官
How about I just finish my beer and I'll be on my way, okay, sir?

446
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,210
你安静点吧 大人在说话呢
How about you be quiet? There are adults are talking.

447
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,590
现在 要么她离开 要么我们把你们全都拽出去
Now it's either she leaves, or we drag you all out by your asses.

448
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,480
我给你个机会 因为我答应了我妈
I'm providing you an opening because I promised my mother

449
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,980
会给像你这样的蠢货一个脱身的机会
I'd give dumb guys like you a chance to walk away.

450
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,480
我们有12个人
We got 12.

451
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,320
你有九个
You got nine.

452
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,870
太可惜了
Well, that's a shame.

453
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,580
你再叫三个人来才有可能赢
You're at least three short.

454
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,920
不要挑衅我们
? Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation ?

455
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,430
我们受够了你的纪律
? We had it with your discipline ?

456
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,550
周六的夜晚...
? Saturday night's all right for fighting...

457
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,970
他锁我的头时 我以为我完了
I thought I was done when that guy got me in a headlock.

458
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,930
- 欠你一个人情 兄弟  - 是啊 兄弟
- Owe you one, brother. - Yeah, brother.

459
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,810
再给我拿点冰 我们就扯平了
Here, give me some more ice, call it even.

460
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,480
好的 热狗五分钟后上桌
All right, hot dogs are up in five.

461
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,980
点燃这支舞
? Gonna set this dance alight ?

462
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,490
因为周六的夜晚是我最爱的夜晚
? 'Cause Saturday night's the night I like ?

463
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,700
周六的夜晚没问题
? Saturday night's all right, all right,

464
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,200
没问题
all right ?

465
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,960
周六...
? Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday...

466
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,290
再来一瓶
Fresh one?

467
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:10,550
周六的夜晚没问题
? Saturday, Saturday, Saturday ?

468
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,800
干杯
Cheers.

469
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,100
- 周六  - 周六
? Saturday, Saturday,

470
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,350
周六...
Saturday, Saturday...

471
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,020
我不应该去军官俱乐部的
You know, uh, I shouldn't've been at the officers' club.

472
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,690
周六
Saturday

473
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,980
我知道
I know.

474
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,690
那为什么要为这事打架
Then why get into a fight over it?

475
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,070
他语气不善
He didn't ask nicely.

476
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,360
周六
? Saturday, Saturday, Saturday...

477
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,200
你和我会成为朋友的 不是吗 雷彻
You and I are gonna be pals, aren't we, Reacher?

478
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,910
周六
? Saturday, Saturday...

479
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,240
已经是朋友了 内格利
Already are, Neagley.

480
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,580
- 来吧  - 耶

481
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,410
好啊

482
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,630
饿吗
Hungry?

483
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,590
嘿
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

484
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,840
我就说一句
Real quick.

485
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,430
91团的男孩们今晚 学到了一个非常重要的教训
Tonight, the boys of the 91st learned a very important lesson.

486
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,010
他们学到了什么
And what did they learn?

487
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,270
不要惹特别调查员
That you do not mess with the Special Investigators!

488
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,020
不要惹特别调查员
You do not mess with the Special Investigators!

489
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,400
是啊

490
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,620
你知道今晚会发生这事
You knew that was gonna happen tonight.

491
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,040
我知道91团的人喜欢周四晚上喝酒
I knew the 91st like to drink on Thursday nights.

492
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,250
而且他们墨守成规
And that they're sticklers for the rules.

493
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,590
而且他们还是混蛋
And that they're assholes.

494
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,840
但现在 我知道他们能一起工作
But now... I know they can all work together.

495
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,050
合影留念 我们作为一个小组的第一天吧
Photo op to commemorate our first day as a unit.

496
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,010
你 去火边
You. Fire.

497
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,060
- 好的 - 去吧

498
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,350
- 我来照吧  - 我能处理 伙计
How about I just take it? Ah, no, man, I got it.

499
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,820
不行 你不能逃避照相 快来
No. No, you're not getting out of it that easy. Come on. Come on.

500
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,490
我能处理
I got this.

501

好的 各位 四秒钟
Okay, guys, four seconds.

502
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,620
- 小心你的骨质疏松 - 去你的 年轻人
Whoa, take it easy on your osteoporosis. Ah, kiss my ass, young blood.

503
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,170
好吧 夜色还早 斯旺
Okay, night's still young, Swan.

504

重新开始弹吉他吧 宝贝
Get back to strumming, baby.

505
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,920
《自由鸟》
"Free Bird"!

506
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,340
我才不干
Hell no.

507
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,920
不弹斯金纳德 齐柏林 亨德里克斯和谁人乐队的歌
No Skynyrd, no Zeppelin, no Hendrix, no Who.

508
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,470
我喜欢轻一点的音乐
I like my music lighter.

509
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,470
但不要害怕 我去撒个尿
But never fear, after I take a leak,

510
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,050
然后你们就能欣赏《鳄鱼摇滚》
you're about to get a little taste of "Crocodile Rock."

511
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,020
- 迫不及待了  - 嘿 雷彻
- Can't wait, can't wait. - Hey, Reacher.

512
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,810
他们把我从直升机上扔了下去 雷彻
They tossed me from a helicopter, Reacher.

513
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,230
你要怎么做
What are you gonna do about it?

514
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,990
欢迎来到洛杉矶国际机场
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.

515
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,240
乘客们 请准备好护照...

516
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,410
芒特先生 您来访的原因是什么
Reason for your visit, Mr. Mount?

517
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,920
请叫我阿德里安 我是来观光的
Oh, Adrian, please. Um, I'm here to sightsee.

518
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,500
要去环球影城 星光大道 中国戏院
Universal Studios, Walk of Fame, Mann's Chinese.

519
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,550
我是个好莱坞狂热爱好者
You know, I'm a bit of an Old Hollywood fanatic.

520
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,710
有需要申报的东西吗
Anything to declare?

521
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,380
我没有需要申报的
I have nothing to declare.

522
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,720
祝您旅途愉快 先生
Enjoy your stay, sir.

523
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,100
护照

Okay, thanks.

525
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,570
我们会跟你保持联系
We'll keep you posted.

526
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,610
安吉拉不知道 哪个邮政邮箱是卡尔文的
Angela has no idea which PO Box belonged to Calvin

527
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,990
在遗产处理完毕前 邮局不会告诉她
and the post office won't give her that information until the estate has been settled

528
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,040
因为邮箱是落在他公司的名义下的
because the box was in his company's name.

529
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,960
我们应该去他办公室看看邮箱吗
Should we check his office again for mail?

530
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,750
我们搜得很彻底了 那儿没有写着邮箱号码的东西
We were thorough. Nothing in there with a box number on it.

531
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,380
我们不能就这样进去试邮箱
We can't just go in there and start trying boxes.

532
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,010
他们会报警 而我们会被指控篡改邮件
They'll call the cops and we'll wind up with federal mail tampering charges.

533
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,510
我们要全面考虑
Then let's think this through.

534
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,720
跟世界上89%的人一样 弗朗茨是右撇子
Like 89% of the world, Franz is right-handed,

535
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,140
所以他可能会要一个进门右边的邮箱
so he probably asked for a box on the right when you enter.

536
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,890
人们喜欢自己更顺手的一边
Humans favor their dominant side.

537
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,770
他会收到发给他的公共记录 监控照片
He gets public records sent to him,

538
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,850
所以他需要一个大号的箱子
surveillance photos, so he's gonna need one of the big boxes.

539
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,060
我会从这些信息开始查
I'll start with them, see which one's packed with mail

540
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,860
看看哪个箱子里面装满了邮件 因为他有段时间没拿了
since Franz hasn't made a pickup in a while.

541
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,530
我只需要你分散他人注意力
I just need a distraction.

542
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,110
收到
Copy that.

543
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,250
嘿 你还好吗 艾伯特
Hey, how goes it... Albert?

544
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,500
我是个铁杆集邮迷
I am a hard-core philatelist

545
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,250
最近发行的这批邮票
and I have been fully aflutter about this new batch of stamps

546
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,590
让我非常激动
that were recently issued...

547
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,510
哪个系列的邮票
Which run?

548
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,140
我们有沙漠之花 州鸟和动漫世界
We've got, uh, Desert Flowers, uh, State Birds and the World of Anime.

549
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,810
全部都很感兴趣
All of 'em.

550
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,230
我口袋里有苏珊硬币 我准备好花掉这些钱了
I've got a bunch of Susan Bs jingling in my pocket and I'm ready to spend 'em.

551
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,310
好的
Um, okay.

552
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,020
至少有两打这样的卡通
There's at least two dozen of these, uh, cartoons.

553
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,570
不知道你熟不熟悉动漫 我觉得是日本的
If you're not familiar with anime, I believe it's Japanese.

554
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,860
好家伙
You don't say.

555
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,580
州鸟非常惊人
Oh, and uh... the State Birds are spectacular.

556
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,750
但永远都集不齐五十种
But never gonna get 50 different species.

557
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,120
西部草地鹨代表了六个不同的州
The Western Meadowlark represents six different states.

558
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,840
不好意思 能让我开我的邮箱吗
Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I get to my box?

559
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,470
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

560
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,470
先生 那是你的钥匙吗
Sir, is that your key?

561
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,560
是的 我只是想不起来 哪个箱子是我的了
Yeah, I just... can't remember which box is mine.

562
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,270
先生 这个人在用不属于他的钥匙
Sir, this man is using a key that isn't his.

563
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,480
- 你是邮政警察吗  - 需要帮忙吗
- What are you, the mail police? - Sir, can I help you?

564
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,520
- 之前邮件被偷过 - 能给我看看花的吗
Could you show me the Flowers, Al?

565
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,150
- 先生  - 这里一切安好
Sir. All good here.

566
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,610
不 我需要您的身份证件 确保您是那个箱子的主人
No, sir, I'm gonna need some ID that ties you to that box.

567
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,650
我全都要 怎么样
You know what? I'll take all of them. How about that?

568
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,240
好了
Here we go.

569
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,660
没事 我只是忘了是哪个箱子了
No problem. Just got my boxes confused.

570
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
你知道怎么着 艾尔 算了吧
You know what, Al? I think I'll pass.

571
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,170
都是什么东西
What do we got?

572
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,010
账单 请求
Bills, solicitations...

573
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,800
潜在线索
Potential.

574
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,020
看来你的“邮局直觉”是对的
Looks like your post office hunch worked.

575
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,890
我说过你很聪明吗 内格利
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley?

576
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,060
- 还远远不够 - 我们得看看这里面有什么
Not nearly enough. We need to see what's on this.

577
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,990
该死 我的笔记本的端口不同
Damn it. My laptop has a different port.

578
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,620
我得去拿个适配器
I got to go pick up an adapter.

579
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,200
帮我个忙 用手机软件叫辆出租车
Do me a favor. Order up a ride on one of those phone app things.

580
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,660
我得借用你的车
I need to borrow your car.

581
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,290
你知道是这个U盘害死弗朗茨的
You know Franz was killed over this hard drive

582
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,830
现在你想去拿把枪
and now you want to go get a gun.

583
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,790
是的
Yup.

584
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,670
但首先 我需要去教堂
But first... I need to go to church.

585
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,850
打扰一下
Excuse me.

586
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,190
我想知道我能否寻求帮助
I was wondering if I could ask for some help.

587
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,980
我们就是给人提供帮助的
Well, that is what we give here.

588
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,730
我在找我的表弟
I'm looking for my cousin.

589
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,360
他有很严重的吸毒问题
He has a really bad drug problem

590
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,110
一个朋友说看见他住在附近的街道上
and a family friend said they saw him living on the street around here.

591
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,910
- 很遗憾听到这个消息 - 谢谢
I'm sorry to hear that. Well, thank you.

592
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,200
我答应过姑姑 不带上她儿子就不回家
I promised my aunt I wouldn't come back home without her son.

593
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,250
我甚至都不知道从哪里开始找
I don't know where to even begin looking.

594
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,920
我想也许教堂有个支持小组之类的
And I thought maybe the church has a support group or something, and... through that,

595
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,500
也许可以通过这种小组 了解吉米在哪里买的毒品
maybe you'd have some idea where Jimmy was scoring?

596
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,590
恶魔创造那种毒药的时候 已经尽了全力 不是吗
The devil did his best work when he created that poison, didn't he?

597
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,720
确实
Sure did.

598
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,100
几乎每个参加我们外展计划的人
Almost everyone who comes in to our outreach program

599
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,680
都是从同一个地方得到“慰藉”的
gets their fix from the same place:

600
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,230
那就是洛克威以东的杜蒙特
Dumont, just east of Rockaway.

601
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,690
但你一个人过去 简直是自寻死路 孩子
But you've got to have a death wish to walk in there alone, son.

602
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,690
我会没事的 神父
I'll be fine, Father.

603
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,740
正义在我这边
I have righteousness on my side.

604
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,910
再多一点
Little extra taste?

605
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,290
我明天会给你带回来
I'll get you back tomorrow?

606
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,210
这不是家具仓库 伙计
This ain't no furniture warehouse, man.

607
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,630
我可不做“公益活动”
I don't do no credit.

608
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,420
在我决定从沙发上起来前给我滚
Get the fuck out of here before I decide to get off my couch, man.

609
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,600
朝我们开过来的傻子是谁
Yo, who's this fool pulling up?

610
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,850
见鬼
Oh, shit!

611
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,020
混蛋疯子
Crazy motherfucker.

612
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,330
可卡因 氧可酮 冰毒 各种毒品应有尽有
Cocaine, Oxy, meth. Full service dealer.

613
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,250
你是谁 混蛋
Motherfucker.

614
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,710
别管我是谁
Don't mind me.

615
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,630
我会拿走这个
I'll be taking this.

616
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,220
还有这个
And this.

617
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,660
这是给外展计划的
For the outreach program.

618
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,590
条形码很完美
Bar codes are perfect.

619
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,880
全息图很立体
Holograms, bulletproof.

620
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,340
- 钱在包里  - 请自便
Money in the bag? Help yourself.

621
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,970
六位数仪器在前面
Six-figure instruments are in the front.

622
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,770
我第一次听说无记名债券 是在《比佛利山庄警察》里
First time I heard about bearer bonds was Beverly Hills Cop.

623
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,770
我不知道这是真的还是电影里杜撰的
I didn't know if they were real or Hollywood bullshit.

624
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,190
你可以为他们点亮一座灯塔 水印完好无损
You could shine a lighthouse on 'em, man. Watermarks are flawless.

625
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,150
没人会知道你是谁
No one'll really know who you really are.

626
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,200
但你知道
But you know.

627
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,550
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

628
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,180
- 刚回来  - 是的
- Just getting back? - Yeah.

629
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,270
我不得不去了三家店 才买到我想要的东西 你呢
Had to go to three stores to get what I needed. You?

630
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,270
- 一个地方就搞定了我要的所有东西 - 那可真好
Got everything I needed in one place. Bet you did.

631
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,940
见鬼
Oh, shit.

632
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,980
我看到你还在用铜指虎
See you're still using brass knuckles.

633
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,190
不用弹簧刀了
No more switchblade?

634
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,230
往下看
Look down.

635
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,780
嘿 奥唐纳
Hey, O'Donnell.

636
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,370
嘿 内格利
Hey, Neagley.

637
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,620
别指责我弄乱了房间 我发现时已经成这样了
Don't blame me for this shithole. I found it like this.

638
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,210
我当时跟我家人在一起
I was with my family.

639
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,090
那周是不插电周
It was, uh, Unplugged Week.

640
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,380
听起来很可怕
That sounds awful.

641
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,260
可不是嘛
No shit.

642
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,590
每年一次 我老婆给我们 在一个偏僻的地方租了一间小屋
Once a year, my wife makes us get a cabin in the middle of nowhere,

643
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,560
没有手机 没有设备 没有电视
no cell phones, no devices, no TVs.

644
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,270
远离屏幕 亲近自然
Less screens, more greens.

645
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,600
理论上很好 但到了第三天 我的恶魔孩子们就想互相残杀
Good in theory, till by the third day my devil children want to kill each other.

646
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,690
我回到家 检查了语音信箱 尽快赶到了这里
So, I got home, checked the voice mail, got here as quick as I could.

647
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,610
那混蛋把我的牙刷折成了两半
Assholes snapped my toothbrush in half.

648
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,030
现在我一无所有了
Now I own nothing.

649
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,450
很高兴你没变
Glad to see you haven't changed.

650
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,030
你变了
You have.

651
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,120
家庭度假 老婆奴
Family vacations. Wife telling you what to do.

652
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,330
不是我记忆中性欲过剩的堕落者了
Not the oversexed degenerate I remember.

653
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,790
我被驯化了
I've been domesticated.

654
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,750
显然是的
Apparently.

655
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,090
我得说 弗朗茨的事让我很生气
Got to say, pretty pissed about this whole Franzy thing.

656
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,220
我很爱那孩子
Kind of loved that kid.

657
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,100
所以我们要杀谁呢
So... who we killing over it?

658
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,020
你什么时候重回T台了
When are you due back on the catwalk?

659
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,570
你看到你穿着跟那个无家可归的
God, you must've been mortified when you saw

660
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,070
在后面的咖啡罐里拉屎的人 一样的衣服一定觉得很羞愧吧
you were wearing the same clothes as the homeless guy taking a shit in a coffee can out back.

661
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,150
见鬼 密码保护
Shit. Password protected.

662
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,700
- 我讨厌猜密码 - 即将更讨厌猜
Hate guessing passwords. About to hate it more.

663
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,120
它已经设置好了 所以我们得在 两分钟内试三次 否则U盘会被删除
Franz set it up so we get three guesses in two minutes or the drive's erased.

664
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,120
它会随着新设备自动启动
And it auto-launched once it recognized a new device.

665
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,660
- 你在搞我吧 - 没
- You got to be shitting me. - Nope.

666
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,620
所以我们要像分析罪犯一样 分析弗朗茨
Okay, so we got to break Franzy down like we'd profile a perp.

667
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,630
密码来自于内心深处
Passwords come from deep down.

668
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,710
弗朗茨的特点是什么  他因什么而出名
What was Franzy's thing? What was he known for?

669
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,880
- 因聪明而出名 - 是啊 但我们都很聪明
Being smart. Yeah, but we were all pretty smart.

670
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,010
匹兹堡 他总说起那里
Pittsburgh? That's all the guy talked about.

671
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,220
海盗队 钢人队 那家把薯条放在面上的三明治店
Pirates, Steelers, that, uh, that sandwich place where they put the fries on top.

672
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,760
- 普利曼迪兄弟 - 对
- Primanti Brothers. - That was it.

673
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,100
不是匹兹堡本身 是他对它的忠诚
Yeah, but not Pittsburgh in and of itself. It was his loyalty to it.

674
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,690
弗朗茨是个忠诚的人
Franz was a loyal guy.

675
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,810
这么多年来一直很喜欢110组 他还教他的孩子们我们的口号
Still loved the 110th after all these years, taught his kid our slogan.

676
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,020
记得他声称1979年的海盗队
Do you remember when he used to claim

677
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,570
比1978年的洋基队更好
that the Pirates of '79 were better than the Yankees of '78?

678
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,780
他们比赛的时候 他都还没出生呢 而他还在那儿吵
I mean, the little shit wasn't even alive when those teams played and he'd still argue his ass off.

679
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,740
但忠诚是个副产品 忠诚从何而来
Okay, but loyalty is a byproduct. Where does it come from?

680
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,870
英雄崇拜 尊重
Hero worship. Respect.

681
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,120
如果他尊重一个人 他就不会被旁人所左右
If Franz respected someone, he couldn't be dissuaded.

682
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,370
海盗队是最厉害的队伍 迈尔斯戴维斯是最伟大的音乐家
Pirates were the greatest team ever. Miles Davis was the greatest musician ever.

683
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,880
- 弗朗茨忠于他尊重的人和事 - 就是这个 你说对了
Franz was loyal to what he respected. That's it. You got it.

684
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,590
罗伯特克莱门特
Roberto Clemente.

685
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,210
他会只用姓氏
He'd only use the last name.

686
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,090
等等 威利斯塔格尔呢
Wait! What about Willie Stargell?

687
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:10,720
威利斯塔格尔在给地震灾民 运送物资时死于飞机失事吗
Did Willie Stargell die in a plane crash delivering supplies to earthquake victims?

688
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,810
是克莱门特
It's Clemente.

689
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,100
不 不是
No, it isn't.

690
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,310
- 谁会用这种设备  - 弗朗茨 正是因为这个原因
Who would use a device like this? Franz. For this very reason.

691
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,730
我会试试迈尔斯戴维斯 弗朗茨很崇拜这家伙
I'm gonna try Miles Davis. Franz worshipped the guy.

692
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,360
很好的猜测 大胆试试吧
Good a guess as any. Go for it.

693
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,650
- 不对 - 见鬼
Nope. Shit.

694
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,280
这就是为何我讨厌猜密码
This is why I hate guessing passwords.

695
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,410
我很不想提出这个建议
Oh, this makes me sick to even suggest this,

696
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,490
走出这个房间 我会否认这种说法
and outside of this room I'll deny ever saying it,

697
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,120
但比起任何球员 艺术家 他最尊重的人是谁
but who did Franz respect more than anyone? Any ballplayer, any artist?

698
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,790
他崇拜的英雄是谁
Who did he hero worship?

699
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,920
别添乱
Get the hell out of here.

700
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,540
进入110组的前几周 他剪了跟你一样的发型
A few weeks into the 110th, the kid started cutting his hair like you,

701
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,130
像你一样说话 跟着你 他想成为你
talking like you, following you around. He wanted to be you, Reacher.

702
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,380
最好确认输入吧 我们时间不多了
You better punch that. We're running out of time.

703
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,680
王八蛋
Son of a bitch.

704
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,360
别自以为是
Don't go getting a big head.

705
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,990
是啊

706
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,820
你好
Hello.

707
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,790
你想要这个吗
Would you like this?

708
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,130
你知道我为何那么喜欢漫画书吗
Now, do you know why I love comic books so much?

709
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,960
因为好人总能获胜
Because the good guys always win.

710
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,340
麦克布莱德先生 您预订了飞往丹佛的航班
Mr. McBride? You're booked for your flight to Denver.

711
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,140
- 祝您旅途愉快 - 谢谢 一定会愉快的
Enjoy your trip. Thank you. I certainly will.

712
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,350
姓名:安德鲁麦克布莱德

713
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,950
“安德鲁麦克布莱德 艾伦梅森 亚历杭德罗门蒂斯 亚历山大...”
Andrew McBride. Alan Mason. Alejandro Mendez. Alexander Markopoulos.

714
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,660
只是一个名单 其中所有名字的首字母都是AM
Just a list of names, all starting with the initials A.M.

715
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,290
全是化名 你保留同样的首字母 这样你的签名永远都不会变
All aliases. You keep the same initials so your signature never has to change.

716
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,330
就一个“A”加一个带波浪线的“M” 无论化名具体是什么
Just an A and an M with a squiggle after it, no matter which pseudonym you're using.

717
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,710
至少你那部分内容还能读出来
Well, at least you can read yours.

718
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,250
我刚得到的是一页又一页的随机数据
I've just got page after page of random numbers.

719
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,880
- 没有顺序 没有意义 什么都没 - 至少我们觉得没有 而且暂时而已
No order. No meaning. Nothing. At least to us. For now.

720
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,170
无论这是什么 它害死了弗朗茨
Well, whatever this shit is, it was enough to get Franz killed,

721
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,340
还害得你们的房间被毁 天知道我们还不知道些什么
your rooms trashed, and God knows whatever else we don't know about.

722
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:17,680
这些人可不会手软
These guys aren't shy about getting aggressive.

723
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,440
- 我们需要更多人力 - 我不愿承认 但他说得对
We need more manpower. Hate to say it, but he's right.

724
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,100
110组的人都联系不上
None of the 110th are reachable.

725
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,980
我们每年都给斯旺寄圣诞贺卡
Well, we send a Christmas card to Swan every year.

726
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,530
我想他现在住在皇后区
I think he lives in Queens now.

727
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,860
我会让莉莉查看我们的假期邮件列表
I'll have Lilly check our holiday mailer list.

728
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,740
- 怎么了  - 你真的被驯化了
What? You really are domesticated.

729
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,550
里面没有任何噪音 一点纽约背景音乐
No noise coming from inside. A little New York background music?

730
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:01,350
卡洛 你妈说你得回家吃饭
Yo, Carlo! Your mom says you got to be home for dinner!

731
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
你们闻到了吗
Oh. You smell that?

732
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,660
我去楼上
I'll take the upstairs.

733
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,510
在这里
In here.

734
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,440
颈圈上写着:“麦丝”
Collar says Maisi.

735
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,160
它把马桶水喝干了
Drank the toilet bowl dry.

736
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,870
脱水而亡 这种死法太痛苦了
Dehydration. That's a tough way to die.

737
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,830
斯旺永远不会让狗渴死
Swan would never let a dog die of thirst.

738
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,040
如果他不回家 那只有一种可能
The only way he doesn't come home is if he couldn't come home.

739
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,380
斯旺死了
Swan's dead.

740
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,010
先是弗朗茨 现在是斯旺
Franzy, now Swan...

741
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,390
我们也联系不上团队其他成员
We can't get ahold of the other team members, either.

742
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:20,890
老大
Boss?

743
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,020
你有什么想法
What are you thinking?

744
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,060
少校
Major?

745
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,690
我觉得有人一心想干掉特别调查员
I'm thinking there's someone hellbent on taking out the Special Investigators.

746
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,900
他们是冲我们来的
And they're coming after us.

747
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,660
很好
Good.

748
