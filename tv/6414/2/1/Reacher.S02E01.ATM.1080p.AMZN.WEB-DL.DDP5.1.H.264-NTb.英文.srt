1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,760
Grew up in the military, worked in the military.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,630
Always told where to go, when to be there. I want to see my country on my own terms.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,300
Motels, cash, fake names, travel light.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,760
You get used to it.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,640
So far, a run on his prints has been clean, but something could still turn up.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,520
No driver's license, mortgage, insurance claims.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,150
No online profile at all.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,650
The only proof Jack Reacher exists is the fact that he's sitting in that room.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,980
Took out a few men in the course of your duties.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,320
All ruled good kills.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,780
Commanded the 110th Special Investigations Unit

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,030
of the Military Police.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,470
100,000 years ago,

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,220
there were people who stayed by the campfire and people who wandered.

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,850
I'm pretty sure I'm a direct descendant of the wandering type.

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,430
It's just who I am.

17
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,700
What am I supposed to do with these?

18
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,290
Wash them and sell them. You're a thrift store.

19
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,290
You buying anything? What I'm wearing.

20
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,750
Jeans, T-shirt, jacket, socks, boxers.

21
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,260
$22.

22
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,270
Eleven.

23
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,770
Yeah, Doug was supposed to take that down a few days ago. It's $22.

24
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,070
If you knew they were supposed to come down, why didn't you do it?

25
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,690
'Cause it's Doug's job.

26
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,780
There's an ATM across the street.

27
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,200
I'll leave you my passport so you know I'm not running off.

28
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,950
Don't care if you do. This job is shit.

29
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,280
Sorry, I have to make another withdrawal.

30
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,050
Don't turn around. I can help you.

31
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,800
Keep taking out money.

32
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,890
That minivan to my left... that yours?

33
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,760
Yes.

34
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,140
Just for clarity, you've been carjacked, right?

35
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,730
My child is in the back seat. Gun?

36
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,900
Yes.

37
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,730
Stay here. This won't take long.

38
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,570
Come on...

39
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,580
Your mom better hurry the fuck up, kid, or this is gonna go bad for both of you.

40
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,560
Hi. Want to see your mom?

41
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,940
It's okay. It's okay.

42
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,110
Come here. It's okay. I mean, I'm here. Oh, baby.

43
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,190
That guy will be out for a while.

44
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,240
Go in the bank, call the cops, give them these.

45
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,780
Gun's in the car.

46
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,700
Wait. Who are you?

47
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,990
Someone who prefers not getting involved.

48
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,940
Here's $30. Need a new jacket.

49
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,230
What's wrong with the one you just bought?

50
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,610
It has blood on it.

51
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,240
Can I use your phone?

52
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,610
I just got a message from a friend.

53
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,670
"Tammi Cates"?

54
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,380
Let me guess. Bank teller, diner waitress, thrift shop cashier?

55
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,510
Third one. I got your message.

56
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,260
110th. 10-30.

57
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,640
A distress call.

58
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,390
Distress call and airfare.

59
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,480
I need you to come to New York ASAP. Why?

60
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,480
Calvin Franz was murdered.

61
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,950
I'll let you know when I land.

62
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,890
Major Reacher.

63
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,720
Hello, sir.

64
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,390
Just Reacher. I didn't tell you to bring anything.

65
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,900
Oh, um, just some office supplies, in case there was any start-up paperwork needed to be done.

66
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,230
- I hate paperwork. - That's okay,

67
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,070
I don't mind doing any clerical there might be, sir.

68
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,780
- Reacher. - Uh, r-right. Reacher.

69
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,410
Um, I hope you don't mind my asking, what exactly am I doing here?

70
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,370
- Want out already, Franz? - No, sir. Um, Reacher.

71
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,750
Uh, no. I-I don't. I'm just curious is all.

72
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,910
Saw you a few weeks ago by your barracks.

73
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,750
Stopped a couple soldiers from beating the hell of each other over a stolen care package from home.

74
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,300
Last cookie in the box, actually.

75
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,500
One cookie?

76
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,420
- Yeah. - Even dumber.

77
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,760
Bottom line, you negotiated a fair settlement,

78
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,220
cracked a few jokes, de-escalated the conflict.

79
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,020
Got a decent head on you. Might come in handy.

80
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,530
Okay, I got to ask,

81
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,070
what the hell kind of unit did Major Reacher put together here, huh?

82
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,660
We got a bean counter from Accounting Services,

83
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,290
a gas jockey from bulk fuel,

84
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,170
we got Dave Matthews,

85
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,750
Grandpa Moses and, uh, a couple of guys from, uh...

86
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,880
where y'all from? I've seen you in Requisitions, right?

87
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
We've got names.

88
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,050
Sanchez and Orozco.

89
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,390
Which one's Orozco?

90
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,940
And who are you, besides a guy who talks too much?

91
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,480
David O'Donnell.

92
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,820
And no offense, Pops, but, uh, why are you here?

93
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,860
Isn't there a CBS drama you're missing?

94
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,650
Lowrey won the Army Marksmanship competition

95
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,110
six times, both pistol and rifle class.

96
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,870
I've got a rule.

97
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,160
Plans go to hell soon as first shot's been fired,

98
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,700
so your first shot better be your best shot.

99
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,460
I'm the only non-Marine to win the USMC 1,000 Yard Invitational,

100
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,920
and I still know Lowrey gives us our best first shot.

101
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,800
You think this unit's gonna come under a lot of fire?

102
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Maybe.

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,090
Then why'd you grab a bunch of people with no police experience, Major Reacher?

104
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,300
- Reacher. - Reacher.

105
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,050
Sorry.

106
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,890
Army wanted a unit for particularly complex matters when they arose.

107
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,400
To do that, I need special investigators, not generic MPs.

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,320
If we're so special, why did they stick us in this dump?

109
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,650
I mean, what is up with this place?

110
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,570
Few years ago, Uncle Sam made an auction bid for some land down the road.

111
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,910
Entered the address backwards

112
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,330
and became the proud owners of this building and the contents

113
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,120
of the now-defunct Callahan Insurance Agency.

114
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,710
But you're right. Place could work a little better.

115
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,880
Straighten up these boxes,

116
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,800
move these old tanker desks to the middle of the room.

117
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,140
Let's go.

118
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,600
You don't have to call me "Major,"

119
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,520
but you do have to move your ass when I say so. Get to it.

120
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Go backwards.

121
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,690
Okay, you want me to go backwards?

122
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,440
- I'm going backwards. - Go back.

123
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,860
Lift with your legs, man! No one lifts with their legs.

124
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,320
On three. One, two, three, go.

125
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,610
You're doing it wrong.

126
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm doing it exactly how you told me to.

127
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,660
You think we're actually gonna be able to work together?

128
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,410
No idea.

129
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,380
But I could use a beer.

130
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,550
Tell them I'm buying.

131
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,630
Reacher.

132
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,750
Neagley.

133
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,720
Thanks for ordering. Still steam coming off the cup.

134
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,640
Tracked the plane online, saw it landed early,

135
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,180
you don't check bags and I adjusted for traffic.

136
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,850
Had the coffee poured 90 seconds ago.

137
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,520
Food's been there three minutes.

138
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,730
Appreciated.

139
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Where'd you get this?

140
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,190
I'm a PI. I can get things.

141
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,820
Been a minute since Margrave.

142
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,870
Been two years, seven months, 19 days.

143
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,200
You look good.

144
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,080
I look the same.

145
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,630
You looked good two years, seven months, 19 days ago,

146
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,710
so, yeah. You look the same.

147
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,670
You look... road-worn.

148
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,840
Yep.

149
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,640
So, Franz. Give me the Cliff Notes.

150
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,020
Went missing after leaving his home in Brooklyn about a week or so ago.

151
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,390
Body was found in the Catskill Mountains.

152
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,440
Whole force up there is, like, 20 cops.

153
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,520
And since Franz disappeared in the city, NYPD's taking the lead.

154
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,440
How'd you find out? Got a call from Angela.

155
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,780
Franzy's widow.  Franz was married?

156
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,990
Yeah. Fun wedding. Chocolate fountain.

157
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,450
He had a son, too.

158
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,460
What? Life moves on when you're away, big fella.

159
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,500
What else?

160
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,260
Franz left me a few messages in the days before his disappearance.

161
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,720
Said he wanted to bounce some stuff off of me about a case he was chasing down.

162
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,100
I was so tied up with my own work, I kept meaning to get back to him, but...

163
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,730
before I could, Angela reached out and told me he'd been murdered.

164
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,860
It's not your fault.

165
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,490
- I know. - He wasn't just murdered.

166
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,280
He was tortured.

167
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,780
Nothing but mucus in his stomach. Dehydrated. No food, no water.

168
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,030
Chucked out of a plane.

169
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,790
They didn't throw him from a plane.

170
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,120
He was found in the middle of nowhere with injuries

171
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,460
consistent with a fall from 3,000 feet.

172
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,960
An airplane has a stall speed of what? 80 miles an hour? 100, tops?

173
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,920
They would've shoved him out of the door's plane horizontally into the slipstream.

174
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,340
He'd bang into the wing or tail.

175
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,970
There'd be perimortem injuries and there aren't.

176
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,680
He was thrown from a helicopter.

177
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,770
His broken legs weren't from the fall, anyway. Because?

178
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,230
Look at his blood work.

179
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,850
Full of free histamines. Massive pain reaction.

180
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,690
You don't get these kind of levels from injuries sustained at the time of death.

181
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,070
Broken legs were a few days old.

182
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,070
That's why ferrous oxide powder was found in his pants fabric.

183
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,910
He was hit with a rusty iron bar.

184
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Must've hurt like hell.

185
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,410
Yep. He was tortured for either revenge or information.

186
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,670
When they were done with him, they dumped him from the sky to avoid ballistics.

187
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,250
Couple of college kids wandered off their hiking trail, saw the body.

188
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,550
If not for them, who knows when he would've been found?

189
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,720
So, next steps?

190
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,640
If he was calling you for help, he may have been trying to get in touch with the rest of the unit.

191
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,140
Probably failed.

192
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,810
I called O'Donnell, Dixon, Sanchez and Orozco.

193
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,400
No one's answering.

194
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,110
No listed number for Swan. Even my office can't find it.

195
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,450
Always a private guy. What about Lowrey?

196
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,990
Killed two years ago in a car accident in Montana.

197
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,450
Funeral was sad, but... it was good to see the gang again.

198
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,420
Guess life ends when you're away, too.

199
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,550
Franz's wedding, Lowrey's funeral. No one told me.

200
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,090
No phone, no address.

201
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,800
You could've sent me an emergency ATM message like today.

202
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,090
First off, I just thought of that.

203
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,760
Second, it wasn't really an emergency.

204
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,060
The emergency was the moment the pickup hit Lowrey.

205
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,020
And be honest, would you really have travelled all the way to Montana

206
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,810
from Texas or Maine or wherever you were at the time

207
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,360
just to look at a body in a box?

208
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,900
No.

209
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,620
So I'll ask again. Next steps?

210
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,750
You really want to let some other cops handle our dead friend's case?

211
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,170
That's what I thought.

212
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,050
Let's go see Franzy's widow.

213
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,790
She just met up with the big one.

214
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,460
You've reached David O'Donnell. I'm not around;

215
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,550
leave a message. I'll call you back.

216
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,890
O'Donnell. This is Reacher with another 10-30.

217
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,930
Neagley and I are staying at the Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.

218
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,100
Get off your ass and call us back.

219
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,310
So, we can't call Swan.

220
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,650
O'Donnell, Sanchez and Orozco still don't answer.

221
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,480
And the receptionist at Dixon's office says

222
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,280
she can't say where Dixon is or when she'll return.

223
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,450
Probably an undercover job.

224
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,530
Maybe.

225
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,740
Or maybe they're all in trouble, too.

226
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,890
Mikey. Go find your crayons and do some coloring time, okay?

227
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,020
Please sit.

228
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,320
Sorry it took me so long to disengage.

229
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,950
It's just hard to get my sister off the phone.

230
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,530
She calls every hour. My own personal suicide watch.

231
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,960
Sorry. That was, uh, morbid. I shouldn't have said that.

232
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
After what you've been through, you can say whatever you want.

233
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,220
Can't believe how much your son looks like Franzy.

234
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
I called him Franzy, too.

235
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,020
Which one of you gave him that name again? I forgot.

236
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,020
O'Donnell.

237
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,900
Right. David O'Donnell.

238
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
And he used to call you The Big Guy.

239
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,780
My God, did Calvin ever tell me stories about you all.

240
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,700
I know he loved me and Mikey more than anything,

241
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,080
but from the way he talked, I don't think he ever ad any more fun

242
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,240
than his years spent with the 110th.

243
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,290
I don't know about that. Ever since you guys got together,

244
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,080
whenever I talked to him, he seemed joyful.

245
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,170
Happier than I ever knew him.

246
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,680
Thank you f-for saying that.

247
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,350
I know the police have already asked you a million questions,

248
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,190
but do you think you could walk us through the time line?

249
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,570
Sure.

250
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,360
I was away with Mikey in Provo,

251
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,240
helping my sister with our mom.

252
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,450
Early-onset dementia.

253
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,580
I tried Calvin for a few days, and no return calls.

254
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,830
It's not like him, so I started to worry.

255
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,830
Called NYPD,

256
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,210
they just said he could've been out on a case because he was a PI

257
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,510
or maybe he was out partying because his wife and kid were out of town.

258
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,550
Do you think that's what he was doing? Out partying with the wrong crowd?

259
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,480
Cal would call if he was gonna be ten minutes late for dinner.

260
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,440
And he didn't party with anybody.

261
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,190
So I got so worried, I came back early to find our home ransacked.

262
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,610
Nothing was taken.

263
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,700
The cops have no idea who did it.

264
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
Were you aware of any cases Franz may have been working on?

265
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,490
He never brought work home.

266
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,920
He said when he was here,

267
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,500
he wanted to be 100% present for me,

268
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,090
and Mikey.

269
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,220
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,890
I want to help. It's just so hard.

271
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,720
Every day hurts.

272
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,310
Just a few more questions. Promise.

273
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Okay.

274
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,480
What was his client base like?

275
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,740
Wall Street types. CEOs, the hedge fund crowd.

276
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,990
Any of them particularly rough? Causing him problems? Stressing him out?

277
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,540
No. Not at all. Once Mikey came along,

278
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,790
he stopped doing the dangerous jobs.

279
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,130
Or so I thought.

280
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,800
Were any other members of the 110th working with him?

281
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,380
I don't know. Maybe there's something in his office.

282
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,970
Sign on the door is Three Rivers Consulting and Associates.

283
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,560
It's 103 Flatbush. It was trashed, too.

284
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,980
The cops couldn't find anything there,

285
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,690
but from what Franzy always told me,

286
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,820
the Special Investigators weren't any old group of cops.

287
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,910
You do not mess with the Special Investigators.

288
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,540
Your daddy teach you that?

289
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,430
Do you want to know how your dad became a Special Investigator?

290
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,560
He stopped a fight between two huge soldiers

291
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,470
because one of them thought the other had stolen

292
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,560
the last homemade cookie sent to him from his mom.

293
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,650
Your dad got them to shake hands and be friends again.

294
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,780
And this guy, right here,

295
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,780
he wanted your dad to be part of the 110th because...

296
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,830
...he saw a man who stayed cool when things got heated.

297
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,380
That's how we became friends with your dad.

298
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,350
Okay.

299
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,490
You know Franz ate the cookie.

300
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,370
- Thought it was for everyone? - Yup.

301
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,420
I'm pretty sure that black sedan halfway down the street

302
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,130
was outside the diner, too.

303
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,670
There's a black sedan on every street in America. Get in.

304
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,480
Did the manager talk? Nah, I paid off the concierge.

305
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,060
He ID'd Neagley as checking in under the name Sarah Conner

306
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,860
and, uh, paying for an adjoining room using the name Starlin Castro.

307
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,570
That must be for the Hulk.

308
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,570
Starlin Castro played for the Yankees, six or seven years ago.

309
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,450
And who's Sarah Conner?

310
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,370
I don't give a shit.

311
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,830
Just keep an eye on that hotel... and them.

312
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,960
Copy that.

313
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,430
Pretty modest for a guy with Wall Street business.

314
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,640
Unpretentious.

315
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,770
Close to home so he can spend more time with his family.

316
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,190
Exact kind of place Franzy would choose.

317
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,820
Angela wasn't kidding when she said trashed.

318
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,490
They probably didn't find anything.

319
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,500
How do you know that?

320
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,170
You don't go to this length if you found what you needed right away.

321
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,170
And they left pissed.

322
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,550
They weren't looking for anything behind this glass window, but they put that phone through it.

323
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,050
That's an act of frustration by someone who didn't find what they wanted.

324
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,510
Whatever they wanted was small.

325
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,350
You don't snap chair legs in half to see

326
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,310
if they've been hollowed out unless you're looking for something that can fit in there.

327
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,650
Hey.

328
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,780
Check this out.

329
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,450
Seems like yesterday.

330
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,130
Keychain?

331
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,980
Franz was sharp, right?

332
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,390
Very sharp.

333
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,110
So if he was dealing with something that could get him killed,

334
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,730
he'd have to put it in a place that was very secure, but readily available.

335
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,200
Somewhere in plain sight that we see every day,

336
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,450
but a place no one would suspect.

337
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,530
Okay.

338
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,830
So what's a place that's readily available

339
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,870
that we entrust every day with very important items?

340
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,000
This is a mailbox key.

341
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,880
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley?

342
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,210
Not nearly enough.

343
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,350
Shit. It's after 5:00.

344
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,860
10,000 combinations if it's a four-number code.

345
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,980
- No point in trying. - Good.

346
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,610
Hate guessing passwords.

347
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,530
We'll have to come back tomorrow.

348
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,530
So, what do we do now?

349
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
Gin.

350
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,410
I don't even know why I play.

351
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,670
'Cause you hold out hope you'll beat me. I won a few hands.

352
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,880
If you let me win, I'm gonna be pissed.

353
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,630
I don't let you win. I pace myself.

354
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,260
Not in your professional life.

355
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,310
Don't follow.

356
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,440
Rental car's a Range Rover, killer hotel rooms,

357
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,400
sent me airfare like it was nothing.

358
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,770
You're doing well.

359
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,820
Clearly not pacing yourself in your professional life.

360
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,910
Not to brag, but the term "wunderkind" has been tossed around the office.

361
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,330
Two promotions in the past two years.

362
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,870
They're opening a satellite office in St. Louis.

363
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,500
Offered me director if I wanted it.

364
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,090
But I like being in the field too much.

365
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,010
Doing what?

366
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,880
Mostly investigative work for high-income individuals.

367
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,510
Government entities, family offices, that kind of thing.

368
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,390
Once in a while we do a pro bono case.

369
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,770
Missing kids, stolen artwork...

370
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,190
So, it's not just about the money.

371
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,480
It feels good.

372
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
What about you?

373
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,160
Saw a minor league game in Sioux Falls a while back.

374
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,360
Riveting.

375
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,040
See it with anyone else?

376
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,330
No.

377
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,250
Did you, uh... talk to anyone at the game?

378
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,010
I ordered a beer.

379
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,590
Okay.

380
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,850
Speaking of talking to people,

381
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,930
when you went out to get gas, I tried everyone again.

382
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,150
Radio silence.

383
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,480
Who'd you call the most?

384
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,530
Sanchez? Orozco? O'Donnell?

385
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,570
Or... Dixon?

386
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,280
She has an answering service.

387
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,780
Instead of leaving a voice mail, there's someone to actually talk to.

388
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,620
Right. 'Cause we just established how much you like talking to people.

389
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
Shut up.

390
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
It's okay.

391
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,590
It was always obvious you guys had a thing for each other.

392
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,800
Did you ever sleep together?

393
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
No.

394
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,760
Why not? Wouldn't have been appropriate.

395
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,090
You were the same rank.

396
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,220
I ran the team.

397
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,600
Not appropriate.

398
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,940
But you found her attractive.

399
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,900
- Who wouldn't? - Me.

400
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,320
I don't find anyone attractive.

401
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,360
Gin.

402
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
I'm going to bed.

403
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,410
I'll pay you back for the room and flight and everything.

404
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,920
I get my pension deposit in about a week.

405
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,170
Not necessary.

406
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,260
I wouldn't have my career if I hadn't matriculated at the School of Reacher.

407
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,840
Consider it past-due tuition.

408
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,340
Something tells me you would've figured it out without me.

409
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,050
Besides, it's a little weird having my Master Sergeant carrying my tab.

410
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,390
I'll get us square.

411
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,100
- Night, Neagley. - Night, Reacher.

412
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,870
For you. Here you go.

413
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,910
Enjoy. Thank you.

414
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,930
Well, here's to a lively bunch.

415
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,930
Should've brought your banjo.

416
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,100
Well, I think after this round, I'm gonna head back to Accounting.

417
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,400
Still have some paperwork I need to finish.

418
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,980
But we just got here.

419
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,280
I know.

420
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,660
If you don't mind me asking, who directed you to field this team, sir?

421
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,370
I don't mind you asking. I do mind you calling me "sir."

422
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,130
You outrank me.

423
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,000
You're a Master Sergeant. Almost everyone outranks you.

424
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,420
You're not supposed to be drinking in uniform.

425
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,680
We're not drinking.

426
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,550
We were drinking. Then you interrupted us.

427
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,310
She doesn't belong here.

428
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,310
It's the Army. Do any of us really belong here?

429
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,020
You some kind of smart guy? Smarter than you.

430
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,480
I'm also a man with a rule.

431
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,110
People leave me and my pals alone, I leave them alone.

432
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,780
They don't, I don't.

433
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,240
I thought his rule was plans go to hell when the first shot's fired.

434
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,700
It's an officers' club. No enlisted.

435
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,120
How about I just finish my beer and I'll be on my way, okay, sir?

436
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,210
How about you be quiet? There are adults are talking.

437
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,590
Now it's either she leaves, or we drag you all out by your asses.

438
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,480
I'm providing you an opening because I promised my mother

439
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,980
I'd give dumb guys like you a chance to walk away.

440
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,480
We got 12.

441
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,320
You got nine.

442
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,870
Well, that's a shame.

443
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,580
You're at least three short.

444
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,920
? Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation ?

445
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,430
? We had it with your discipline ?

446
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,550
? Saturday night's all right for fighting...

447
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,970
I thought I was done when that guy got me in a headlock.

448
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,930
- Owe you one, brother. - Yeah, brother.

449
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,810
Here, give me some more ice, call it even.

450
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,480
All right, hot dogs are up in five.

451
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,980
? Gonna set this dance alight ?

452
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,490
? 'Cause Saturday night's the night I like ?

453
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,700
? Saturday night's all right, all right,

454
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,200
all right ?

455
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,960
? Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday...

456
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,290
Fresh one?

457
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:10,550
? Saturday, Saturday, Saturday ?

458
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,800
Cheers.

459
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,100
? Saturday, Saturday,

460
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,350
Saturday, Saturday...

461
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,020
You know, uh, I shouldn't've been at the officers' club.

462
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,690
Saturday

463
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,980
I know.

464
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,690
Then why get into a fight over it?

465
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,070
He didn't ask nicely.

466
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,360
? Saturday, Saturday, Saturday...

467
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,200
You and I are gonna be pals, aren't we, Reacher?

468
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,910
? Saturday, Saturday...

469
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,240
Already are, Neagley.

470
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,630
Hungry?

471
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,590
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

472
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,840
Real quick.

473
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,430
Tonight, the boys of the 91st learned a very important lesson.

474
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,010
And what did they learn?

475
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,270
That you do not mess with the Special Investigators!

476
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,020
You do not mess with the Special Investigators!

477
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,620
You knew that was gonna happen tonight.

478
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,040
I knew the 91st like to drink on Thursday nights.

479
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,250
And that they're sticklers for the rules.

480
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,590
And that they're assholes.

481
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,840
But now... I know they can all work together.

482
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,050
Photo op to commemorate our first day as a unit.

483
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,010
You. Fire.

484
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,060
- Go. - Okay.

485
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,350
How about I just take it? Ah, no, man, I got it.

486
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,820
No. No, you're not getting out of it that easy. Come on. Come on.

487
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,490
I got this.

488
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,410
Okay, guys, four seconds.

489
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,620
Whoa, take it easy on your osteoporosis. Ah, kiss my ass, young blood.

490
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,170
Okay, night's still young, Swan.

491
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,710
Get back to strumming, baby.

492
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,920
"Free Bird"!

493
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,340
Hell no.

494
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,920
No Skynyrd, no Zeppelin, no Hendrix, no Who.

495
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,470
I like my music lighter.

496
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,470
But never fear, after I take a leak,

497
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,050
you're about to get a little taste of "Crocodile Rock."

498
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,020
- Can't wait, can't wait. - Hey, Reacher.

499
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,810
They tossed me from a helicopter, Reacher.

500
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,230
What are you gonna do about it?

501
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,990
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.

502
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,240
Passengers, please have passports ready...

503
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,410
Reason for your visit, Mr. Mount?

504
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,920
Oh, Adrian, please. Um, I'm here to sightsee.

505
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,500
Universal Studios, Walk of Fame, Mann's Chinese.

506
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,550
You know, I'm a bit of an Old Hollywood fanatic.

507
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,710
Anything to declare?

508
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,380
I have nothing to declare.

509
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,720
Enjoy your stay, sir.

510
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,110
Okay, thanks.

511
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,570
We'll keep you posted.

512
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,610
Angela has no idea which PO Box belonged to Calvin

513
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,990
and the post office won't give her that information until the estate has been settled

514
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,040
because the box was in his company's name.

515
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,960
Should we check his office again for mail?

516
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,750
We were thorough. Nothing in there with a box number on it.

517
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,380
We can't just go in there and start trying boxes.

518
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,010
They'll call the cops and we'll wind up with federal mail tampering charges.

519
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,510
Then let's think this through.

520
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,720
Like 89% of the world, Franz is right-handed,

521
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,140
so he probably asked for a box on the right when you enter.

522
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,890
Humans favor their dominant side.

523
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,770
He gets public records sent to him,

524
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,850
surveillance photos, so he's gonna need one of the big boxes.

525
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,060
I'll start with them, see which one's packed with mail

526
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,860
since Franz hasn't made a pickup in a while.

527
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,530
I just need a distraction.

528
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,110
Copy that.

529
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,250
Hey, how goes it... Albert?

530
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,500
I am a hard-core philatelist

531
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,250
and I have been fully aflutter about this new batch of stamps

532
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,590
that were recently issued...

533
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,510
Which run?

534
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,140
We've got, uh, Desert Flowers, uh, State Birds and the World of Anime.

535
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,810
All of 'em.

536
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,230
I've got a bunch of Susan Bs jingling in my pocket and I'm ready to spend 'em.

537
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,310
Um, okay.

538
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,020
There's at least two dozen of these, uh, cartoons.

539
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,570
If you're not familiar with anime, I believe it's Japanese.

540
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,860
You don't say.

541
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,580
Oh, and uh... the State Birds are spectacular.

542
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,750
But never gonna get 50 different species.

543
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,120
The Western Meadowlark represents six different states.

544
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,840
Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I get to my box?

545
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,470
Yeah, sure.

546
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,470
Sir, is that your key?

547
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,560
Yeah, I just... can't remember which box is mine.

548
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,270
Sir, this man is using a key that isn't his.

549
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,480
- What are you, the mail police? - Sir, can I help you?

550
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,520
Could you show me the Flowers, Al?

551
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,150
Sir. All good here.

552
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,610
No, sir, I'm gonna need some ID that ties you to that box.

553
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,650
You know what? I'll take all of them. How about that?

554
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,240
Here we go.

555
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,660
No problem. Just got my boxes confused.

556
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
You know what, Al? I think I'll pass.

557
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,170
What do we got?

558
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,010
Bills, solicitations...

559
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,800
Potential.

560
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,020
Looks like your post office hunch worked.

561
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,890
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley?

562
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,060
Not nearly enough. We need to see what's on this.

563
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,990
Damn it. My laptop has a different port.

564
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,620
I got to go pick up an adapter.

565
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,200
Do me a favor. Order up a ride on one of those phone app things.

566
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,660
I need to borrow your car.

567
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,290
You know Franz was killed over this hard drive

568
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,830
and now you want to go get a gun.

569
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,790
Yup.

570
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,670
But first... I need to go to church.

571
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,850
Excuse me.

572
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,190
I was wondering if I could ask for some help.

573
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,980
Well, that is what we give here.

574
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,730
I'm looking for my cousin.

575
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,360
He has a really bad drug problem

576
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,110
and a family friend said they saw him living on the street around here.

577
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,910
I'm sorry to hear that. Well, thank you.

578
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,200
I promised my aunt I wouldn't come back home without her son.

579
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,250
I don't know where to even begin looking.

580
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,920
And I thought maybe the church has a support group or something, and... through that,

581
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,500
maybe you'd have some idea where Jimmy was scoring?

582
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,590
The devil did his best work when he created that poison, didn't he?

583
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,720
Sure did.

584
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,100
Almost everyone who comes in to our outreach program

585
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,680
gets their fix from the same place:

586
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,230
Dumont, just east of Rockaway.

587
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,690
But you've got to have a death wish to walk in there alone, son.

588
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,690
I'll be fine, Father.

589
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,740
I have righteousness on my side.

590
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,910
Little extra taste?

591
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,290
I'll get you back tomorrow?

592
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,210
This ain't no furniture warehouse, man.

593
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,630
I don't do no credit.

594
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,420
Get the fuck out of here before I decide to get off my couch, man.

595
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,600
Yo, who's this fool pulling up?

596
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,850
Oh, shit!

597
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,020
Crazy motherfucker.

598
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,330
Cocaine, Oxy, meth. Full service dealer.

599
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,250
Motherfucker.

600
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,710
Don't mind me.

601
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,630
I'll be taking this.

602
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,220
And this.

603
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,660
For the outreach program.

604
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,590
Bar codes are perfect.

605
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,880
Holograms, bulletproof.

606
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,340
Money in the bag? Help yourself.

607
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,970
Six-figure instruments are in the front.

608
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,770
First time I heard about bearer bonds was Beverly Hills Cop.

609
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,770
I didn't know if they were real or Hollywood bullshit.

610
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,190
You could shine a lighthouse on 'em, man. Watermarks are flawless.

611
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,150
No one'll really know who you really are.

612
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,200
But you know.

613
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,550
- Hey. - Hey.

614
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,180
- Just getting back? - Yeah.

615
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,270
Had to go to three stores to get what I needed. You?

616
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,270
Got everything I needed in one place. Bet you did.

617
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,940
Oh, shit.

618
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,980
See you're still using brass knuckles.

619
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,190
No more switchblade?

620
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,230
Look down.

621
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,780
Hey, O'Donnell.

622
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,370
Hey, Neagley.

623
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,620
Don't blame me for this shithole. I found it like this.

624
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,210
I was with my family.

625
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,090
It was, uh, Unplugged Week.

626
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,380
That sounds awful.

627
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,260
No shit.

628
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,590
Once a year, my wife makes us get a cabin in the middle of nowhere,

629
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,560
no cell phones, no devices, no TVs.

630
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,270
Less screens, more greens.

631
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,600
Good in theory, till by the third day my devil children want to kill each other.

632
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,690
So, I got home, checked the voice mail, got here as quick as I could.

633
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,610
Assholes snapped my toothbrush in half.

634
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,030
Now I own nothing.

635
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,450
Glad to see you haven't changed.

636
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,030
You have.

637
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,120
Family vacations. Wife telling you what to do.

638
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,330
Not the oversexed degenerate I remember.

639
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,790
I've been domesticated.

640
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,750
Apparently.

641
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,090
Got to say, pretty pissed about this whole Franzy thing.

642
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,220
Kind of loved that kid.

643
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,100
So... who we killing over it?

644
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,020
When are you due back on the catwalk?

645
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,570
God, you must've been mortified when you saw

646
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,070
you were wearing the same clothes as the homeless guy taking a shit in a coffee can out back.

647
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,150
Shit. Password protected.

648
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,700
Hate guessing passwords. About to hate it more.

649
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,120
Franz set it up so we get three guesses in two minutes or the drive's erased.

650
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,120
And it auto-launched once it recognized a new device.

651
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,660
- You got to be shitting me. - Nope.

652
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,620
Okay, so we got to break Franzy down like we'd profile a perp.

653
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,630
Passwords come from deep down.

654
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,710
What was Franzy's thing? What was he known for?

655
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,880
Being smart. Yeah, but we were all pretty smart.

656
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,010
Pittsburgh? That's all the guy talked about.

657
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,220
Pirates, Steelers, that, uh, that sandwich place where they put the fries on top.

658
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,760
- Primanti Brothers. - That was it.

659
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,100
Yeah, but not Pittsburgh in and of itself. It was his loyalty to it.

660
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,690
Franz was a loyal guy.

661
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,810
Still loved the 110th after all these years, taught his kid our slogan.

662
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,020
Do you remember when he used to claim

663
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,570
that the Pirates of '79 were better than the Yankees of '78?

664
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,780
I mean, the little shit wasn't even alive when those teams played and he'd still argue his ass off.

665
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,740
Okay, but loyalty is a byproduct. Where does it come from?

666
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,870
Hero worship. Respect.

667
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,120
If Franz respected someone, he couldn't be dissuaded.

668
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,370
Pirates were the greatest team ever. Miles Davis was the greatest musician ever.

669
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,880
Franz was loyal to what he respected. That's it. You got it.

670
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,590
Roberto Clemente.

671
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,210
He'd only use the last name.

672
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,090
Wait! What about Willie Stargell?

673
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:10,720
Did Willie Stargell die in a plane crash delivering supplies to earthquake victims?

674
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,810
It's Clemente.

675
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,100
No, it isn't.

676
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,310
Who would use a device like this? Franz. For this very reason.

677
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,730
I'm gonna try Miles Davis. Franz worshipped the guy.

678
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,360
Good a guess as any. Go for it.

679
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,650
Nope. Shit.

680
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,280
This is why I hate guessing passwords.

681
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,410
Oh, this makes me sick to even suggest this,

682
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,490
and outside of this room I'll deny ever saying it,

683
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,120
but who did Franz respect more than anyone? Any ballplayer, any artist?

684
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,790
Who did he hero worship?

685
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,920
Get the hell out of here.

686
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,540
A few weeks into the 110th, the kid started cutting his hair like you,

687
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,130
talking like you, following you around. He wanted to be you, Reacher.

688
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,380
You better punch that. We're running out of time.

689
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,680
Son of a bitch.

690
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,360
Don't go getting a big head.

691
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,820
Hello.

692
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,790
Would you like this?

693
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,130
Now, do you know why I love comic books so much?

694
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,960
Because the good guys always win.

695
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,340
Mr. McBride? You're booked for your flight to Denver.

696
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,140
Enjoy your trip. Thank you. I certainly will.

697
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,950
Andrew McBride. Alan Mason. Alejandro Mendez. Alexander Markopoulos.

698
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,660
Just a list of names, all starting with the initials A.M.

699
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,290
All aliases. You keep the same initials so your signature never has to change.

700
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,330
Just an A and an M with a squiggle after it, no matter which pseudonym you're using.

701
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,710
Well, at least you can read yours.

702
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,250
I've just got page after page of random numbers.

703
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,880
No order. No meaning. Nothing. At least to us. For now.

704
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,170
Well, whatever this shit is, it was enough to get Franz killed,

705
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,340
your rooms trashed, and God knows whatever else we don't know about.

706
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:17,680
These guys aren't shy about getting aggressive.

707
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,440
We need more manpower. Hate to say it, but he's right.

708
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,100
None of the 110th are reachable.

709
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,980
Well, we send a Christmas card to Swan every year.

710
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,530
I think he lives in Queens now.

711
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,860
I'll have Lilly check our holiday mailer list.

712
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,740
What? You really are domesticated.

713
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,550
No noise coming from inside. A little New York background music?

714
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:01,350
Yo, Carlo! Your mom says you got to be home for dinner!

715
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Oh. You smell that?

716
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,660
I'll take the upstairs.

717
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,510
In here.

718
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,440
Collar says Maisi.

719
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,160
Drank the toilet bowl dry.

720
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,870
Dehydration. That's a tough way to die.

721
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,830
Swan would never let a dog die of thirst.

722
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,040
The only way he doesn't come home is if he couldn't come home.

723
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,380
Swan's dead.

724
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,010
Franzy, now Swan...

725
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,390
We can't get ahold of the other team members, either.

726
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:20,890
Boss?

727
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,020
What are you thinking?

728
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,060
Major?

729
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,690
I'm thinking there's someone hellbent on taking out the Special Investigators.

730
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,900
And they're coming after us.

731
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,660
Good.
