1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,630
《烈探雷徹》前情提要
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,670
他說:“六千五 每手十萬”
He said 650 at 100K each.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,300
可能是六千五百萬的轉賬 六千五百萬的掩飾費
It could be a transfer of 65 million, a $65 million cover-up,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,890
六千五百萬的賄賂款
a $65 million bribe.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,930
我們找到了一個嫌疑人
We got a suspect.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,050
阿扎里馬哈茂德
Azhari Mahmoud.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,770
國際刑警組織 知道他是恐怖組織的武器經紀人
He's known to Interpol as a weapons broker for terrorist organizations.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,640
“他如幽靈一般 任何地方都沒有他的照片”
He's a ghost. No pictures of him anywhere.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,020
如果這些是分數 那寫下這些數字的人就太粗心了
If these are supposed to be fractions, then it's sloppy work.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,610
每張紙上有26或27個數字列表
On each sheet there's 26 or 27 numerical tabulations.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,740
真正的問題是 他們在算什么事的時間
So, the real question is what kind of somethings were they counting?

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,950
今晚你不必孤單
You don't have to be lonely tonight.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,660
在大西洋城的時候 有殺手曾經想殺了我們
There were hit men who tried to kill us in Atlantic City.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,370
他們失敗了 但他們有一張 叫新時代的公司的停車證
They failed, but they had a parking pass for a company called New Age.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,830
新時代是一家航空航天公司
New Age is an aerospace company.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,130
我是馬洛伯恩斯 新時代的運營總監
I'm Marlo Burns, New Age Director of Operations.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,460
停車證被發給了 一個叫特雷弗薩羅皮安的男人
The parking pass was issued to a man named Trevor Saropian.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,630
- 他的車在哪兒  - 我們決定把車帶走
- Where's his car? - We decided to take it with us.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,010
天啊 是斯旺
Holy shit. It's Swan.

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,310
他曾在新世紀工作
He was working at New Age

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,390
跟一直想殺了我們的這群人一起
with the people who've been trying to kill us.

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,440
餐廳

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,940
真棒 我們開車撞破窗戶
Great. Well, we drove a car through a window

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,940
這樣我就可以閱讀 一位五年前在新時代
so that I could read workers comp pleadings

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,030
滑倒的秘書的工傷賠償訴狀了
for a secretary who slipped on New Age stairs five years ago.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,780
真開心我們為此冒著坐牢的風險
So glad we risked prison for that.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,990
是啊 我也一無所獲 沒有新線索
Yeah, I got nothing, too. No new information.

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,500
我倒是覺得我們發現了一些新線索
Well, I wouldn't say we haven't found any new information.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,880
我們有三名特別調查員死亡
I mean, we've got three special investigators dead,

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,790
一名在逃
one in the wind,

31
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,420
而失蹤的那位剛好在新時代工作過
and the one who's missing just happens to be the one who worked for New Age.

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,180
怎么了 總得有人說出來
What? Look, someone's got to say it.

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,760
斯旺是這些人的同事還是同謀
Was Swan working with these guys or with these guys?

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,600
斯旺是良民
Swan's not dirty.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,020
- 我們都想相信他沒... - 我了解斯旺 我們都了解
- Look, man, we all want to believe that he isn't... - I know Swan. We all do.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,150
你覺得那一點可能性都沒有嗎
And you don't think there's even a chance...

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,030
絕不可能
No. I don't.

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,780
專注于我們的發現
Focus on what we found.

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
“布拉德”
Brad?

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,500
史黛西
Stacy?

41
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,960
我說的是這種“布拉德”
This is a brad.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,380
那是緊固件 這么小的東西 居然有兩個名字 太蠢了
That is a fastener. Two names for something that size is stupid.

43
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,050
這段對話也很蠢
So is this conversation.

44
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,550
說起名字
Well, speaking of names,

45
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,100
我剛在員工目錄中 發現了我們的人的名字
just found our man in the employee directory.

46
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,520
看來斯旺的職位是安全總監助理
Seems Swan's title was assistant director of security.

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,060
“謝恩蘭斯頓 安全總監”
Shane Langston, director of security.

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,400
也許在大西洋城 跟我通話的就是這個人
Maybe he's the guy I got on the phone in Atlantic City.

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,480
何出此言
Why would you say that?

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,400
他是安全部門的老大 負責發號施令
He's the security boss and bosses give orders

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,610
我們殺掉的那些人 接到命令要干掉我們
and the guys we killed had orders to take us out.

52
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,700
這只是推測 他可能是 讓斯旺陷入這一切的罪魁禍首
Just a theory. He could be the guy that got Swan caught up in all this.

53
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,080
如果不是斯旺先讓他卷進去的話
Well, if Swan didn't pull him into it first...

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,710
- 我已經跟你說了... - 你不是說假設害死人嗎
I already told you... Aren't you the guy that said that assumptions kill?

55
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,830
你在假設斯旺 離開110小組后沒有變化
Well, you're assuming that Swan's the same guy he was back in the 110.

56
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,050
嘿 這就是雷徹 在薩羅皮安家外面追的那個人
Hey, this is the guy Reacher chased down outside of Saropian's house.

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,260
跟他身份證的照片一致
Same photo as his ID badge.

58
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,720
副安全官員
Associate security officer.

59
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,850
真不錯
Well, that's great.

60
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,970
斯旺 柯林斯
Swan, Collins,

61
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,890
兩名新時代的安全部門人員與此有關
that's two New Age security personnel somehow involved in this.

62
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,230
- 現在我們得調查所有這些混蛋 - 別忘了馬洛伯恩斯
Now we got to look into all these fuckers. Don't forget Marlo Burns.

63
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,610
是她置我們于險境 她給了我們薩羅皮安的地址
She knew she was sending us right into a buzzsaw when she gave us Saropian's address.

64
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,480
所以整個公司都很可疑
So, the entire company's suspect.

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,190
這個公司有一千多名員工 我們怎么查這么多人
We got over a thousand employees. How we gonna tackle that?

66
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,370
一次一個
One at a time.

67
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,460
烈探雷徹
第二季第四集

68
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,460
本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

69
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,050
紐約市

70
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,010
昨晚 你申請了 某國防公司的深夜搜查令
Last night you asked for a late night warrant for some defense firm,

71
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,310
而一個小時后 這地方就發生了入室盜竊
and an hour later, the place is hit with a smash-and-grab.

72
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,930
你知道這讓我們看起來像什么嗎
Okay, do you know how that makes this department look?

73
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,940
就好像我們步步落后一樣
Like we're five steps behind everything.

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,690
我收集到了足夠多的證據 才申請的搜查令
I made those applications when I had enough for a warrant.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,030
而在你等待搜查令的時候 你本該從那里收集的證據
And while you were waiting for them, all the evidence that you would have collected

76
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,990
已經全部被帶走了
from that place is all cleaned out.

77
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,700
我跟你打賭 就是那些
And I'll bet you that it is those tin soldiers

78
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,780
給你打出黑眼圈的破軍人干的
that you were supposed to be keeping your black eye on.

79
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,540
不是那群軍隊混混干的 我跟他們說得很清楚
It wasn't the army brats. I made it crystal clear to them

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,460
- 讓他們守規矩  - 我知道了
not to color outside the lines. Oh, I see.

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,000
你覺得你好好跟他們說話 他們就會配合
You thought, if you told them nicely, they'd play along?

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,920
你是紐約市警察局的
You're NYPD.

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,420
天啊 這些人都是他媽的私家偵探
These are fucking PIs, for Chrissakes.

84
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,090
這超出你的能力范圍了嗎 拉索
Is this too fucking much for you, Russo?

85
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,720
中尉 小聲點
Lieutenant, lower your voice.

86
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,550
小聲點
Lower my voice?

87
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,850
你讓我在我自己的辦公室里 講話小聲點
You're telling me to lower my voice in my own fucking office?

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,770
好吧
Okay.

89
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,850
請你去了解一下 他們都發現了什么 好嗎
Would you please go and find out what they learned, all right?

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,480
我這么說話夠客氣了吧 拉索
Am I asking you nicely enough, Russo?

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,190
- 我會處理好的 - 很好
I'll get it handled. Great.

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
關門
Close the door.

93
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,870
誰放的這首歌
Who put this song on?

94
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,420
這是傳聲頭像樂隊的歌
This is the Talking Heads.

95
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,290
你跟傳聲頭像樂隊有仇嗎  我們現在在紐約呢
You got beef with the Talking Heads? We're in New York.

96
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,540
他們是紐約的樂隊
They're a New York band.

97
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,460
搬到了紐約的羅德島樂隊
They're a Rhode Island band that moved to New York

98
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,970
沒 我跟他們沒仇 只是
and no, I don't have a beef with them. It's just...

99
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,510
《此路不通》  剛好我們坐在這兒毫無進展
"Road to Nowhere," when we're sitting here getting nowhere,

100
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,970
貌似有點晦氣
seems a little defeatist.

101
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,520
而且這不是他們最好的歌
Besides, it's not even their best song.

102
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,020
我更喜歡《變態殺手》
Probably prefer "Psycho Killer."

103
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,480
我可能找到線索了
Um, I might have something.

104
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,940
我一直在找U盤里 所有和斯旺有關的內容
I've been scrubbing the drives for everything Swan-related.

105
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
- 然后呢  - 我發現了一件反常的事
- And? - And I found an anomaly.

106
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,030
他是安全總監助理
He's the assistant director of security,

107
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,660
他所有的電子郵件 都抄送了他的上司蘭斯頓
so all of his emails have Langston-- his boss--

108
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,280
以及其他六名安保人員
and a half-dozen other security personnel cc'd on them.

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,660
合情合理 他們是一個團隊 得共享信息
Makes sense. I mean, they're a team. They share information.

110
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,540
但他沒有分享一切
But he didn't share everything.

111
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,210
有幾封郵件是斯旺 和我們的老朋友馬洛伯恩斯的
There are multiple emails between Swan and our old friend Marlo Burns.

112
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,040
只有他們倆 沒有抄送其他人
Just them. No one else copied.

113
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,960
是關于什么的
About what?

114
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,760
音樂 但又不全是
Music, but not really.

115
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,170
你怎么知道
How do you know?

116
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,670
他寫道
He wrote,

117
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,010
“前幾天我在聽一張專輯
"I was listening to an album the other day,

118
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,310
“我覺得你可能會喜歡 吉米亨德里克斯的《大膽如愛》
thought you might like it. Jimi Hendrix, Bold as Love.

119
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,480
“第六首歌太贊了 聽聽看 告訴我你的想法”
The sixth song is amazing. Take a listen, tell me what you think."

120
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
斯旺很討厭亨德里克斯 他討厭任何吵鬧的吉他曲...
Swan hated Hendrix. Anything with hard guitar.

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,900
不彈斯金納德 齊柏林 亨德里克斯和誰人樂隊的歌
No Skynyrd, no Hendrix, no Zeppelin, no Who.

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,490
- 這是他的原則 - 他沒有讓其他人看這封郵件
I mean, that was his rule. He's leaving everyone else off the email

123
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,110
而他在郵件里說他喜歡 我們知道他討厭的東西
and saying he loved something we know he hated.

124
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,110
可能是暗號
Could be code.

125
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,580
或者也可能是春心萌動
Or it could be a guy trying to get laid.

126
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,500
我曾經跟一個女孩說 我喜歡喬治亞歐姬芙
I mean, I once told a girl I loved Georgia O'Keeffe.

127
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,580
我們會說這種話
We say things.

128
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,170
是的 我查到第六首歌叫《小翅膀》
Yeah. It says the sixth track is called "Little Wing."

129
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,340
等等
Hold on.

130
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,680
- 我說過你很聰明嗎 內格利  - 還遠遠不夠
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley? Not nearly enough.

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,930
這里 這是一份聯邦國防項目的文件 項目名叫“小翅膀”
Right here. A file on a federal defense project called Little Wing,

132
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,520
這是迄今為止 新時代簽下的最大的合同
by far the biggest contract New Age has ever had.

133
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,020
是我在其他記錄中見過的四倍
Four times the size of anything I've seen anywhere else in their records.

134
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,520
一份九位數的合同
A nine-figure contract.

135
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,110
人們為了更少的利益殺人
People have murdered for less.

136
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,150
看看這份辦公室內部備忘錄
Look at this interoffice memo.

137
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,450
他們似乎為一些軍事要員 甚至包括一位參議員
Seems a test for the Little Wing tech was held for some military brass,

138
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,570
對小翅膀科技進行了測試
even a senator.

139
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,450
什么測試 在哪兒測的
But what kind of test? And where?

140
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,410
上面沒寫
Doesn't say,

141
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,620
但他們確實指出 參議員馬爾科姆拉沃伊
but they do note that Senator Malcolm Lavoy

142
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,170
保證他會獲得國會的選票 讓小翅膀變成現實
assured he would do all he could to get the congressional votes to make Little Wing a reality.

143
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,250
我引用原文
And I quote,

144
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,710
“他完全相信我們 在新時代做的這項工作
"He fully believes in the work we're doing here at New Age

145
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,550
“并且會不惜一切代價幫助我們”
and will do whatever it takes to help us."

146
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,590
如果你給的錢夠多 拉沃伊連《芝麻街》的史納菲都信
Lavoy would fully believe in Snuffleupagus you pay him enough.

147
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,880
你知道這個人
You know this guy?

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,100
有所耳聞 在華盛頓特區 拉沃伊被稱為“紙袋”
By reputation. In D.C., Lavoy's what's known as a paper bag.

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,470
他的政治方針和投票都飄忽不定
His politics and his vote go whichever way the wind's blowing.

150
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,270
眾所周知 他會做見不得人的事
He's known to do some shady shit.

151
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,520
所以如果新時代能靠政府合同發財
So, if New Age stands to make a fortune on

152
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,820
而拉沃伊是他們在國會的擁護者
a government contract and Lavoy is his champion in Congress,

153
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,530
這就說明新時代 讓拉沃伊的口袋裝得滿滿的
it stands to reason New Age is the wind blowing Lavoy's bag.

154
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,940
這聽起來不對
That sounds wrong.

155
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,410
所以 失蹤且尚不清楚 是否是良民的斯旺
So, Swan, who's missing, maybe dirty, maybe not,

156
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,080
給之前想殺了我們的馬洛伯恩斯
is code-texting Marlo Burns, who tried to have us killed

157
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
發了含有代碼的郵件
about a program supported

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,960
其內容是關于 一個道德敗壞的政客支持的項目
by an ethically-compromised politician.

159
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,420
我們得跟馬爾科姆拉沃伊談談
We need talk to Malcolm Lavoy.

160
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,500
我們永遠沒法接近參議員 從他口中套話
We'll never get close enough to a senator to find out what he may or may not know.

161
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,970
我們不需要接近他 這些人 從來都不清楚自己在給什么投票
Oh, we don't need to. Those guys never even know what they're voting for.

162
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,930
一千頁的法案 立法記錄 他們不會讀那些東西的
Thousand-page bills, the legislative record, they don't read that stuff.

163
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,430
他們只會按照被告知的方式投票 但他的立法主任
They just vote the way they're told to. But his legislative director--

164
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,520
實際上是他們制定并起草法案
they're the guys who actually craft and draft the laws,

165
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,480
這對我們有利 因為這些人沒有安保人員
which is good for us because those guys have no security detail.

166
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,190
這些人為什么要跟我們說呢
Okay, but why would those people talk to us?

167
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,820
我可以讓他們說話 讓他們求著告訴我們他們知道的事
I can make it so they'll be begging to tell us what they know.

168
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,820
你有什么想跟我們分享的事情嗎
Something you want to share with the class?

169
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,370
聽著 華盛頓特區有很多有權勢的人
Look, there's a lot of powerful people in D.C. with, uh...

170
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,120
都有見不得光的事
confidential problems.

171
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,880
主要是不大光彩 但是合法的
Mainly unsavory, but legal, things they do

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,170
是一些他們不愿公開的私人行為
in private that they'd rather not get made public.

173
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,130
我的工作就是 確保他們的私事永不見光
My job is to make sure that their personal business stays personal.

174
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,050
而知道秘密的人會保守住這些秘密
And the people who know secrets, they keep those secrets.

175
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,050
所以 你敲詐勒索
So, you blackmail?

176
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,510
我是激勵他們
I incentivize.

177
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,140
聽起來很不道德 奧唐納
Sounds sleazy, O'D.

178
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,970
比不道德差那么一點
It's sleazy-adjacent.

179
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,980
嘿 我得付私立學校的學費 好嗎
Hey, I got private school tuition to pay for, okay?

180
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,230
我從不違法
I never break the law.

181
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,690
我只是把事實擺在人們面前 讓他們知道
I simply present the facts to people and let them know

182
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,900
如果他們做錯了選擇會發生什么
which way the river's gonna flow if they choose the wrong course of action.

183
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
給我十分鐘打幾個電話
You give me ten minutes to make some phone calls,

184
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,990
我會找到立法主任的名字 和他的致命弱點
I'll get the name of the legislative director and an Achilles' heel.

185
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,620
動手吧
Do it.

186
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,080
好的
All right.

187
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,170
謝謝
Thank you.

188
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,260
我知道你不想說斯旺...
Reacher, I know you don't want to talk about Swan...

189
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,970
斯旺是清白的 如果他有問題 他不會像其他人一樣消失
Swan's clean. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have disappeared like the rest of the guys.

190
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,390
但他并沒有像其他人一樣消失
But he didn't disappear like the rest of the guys.

191
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,680
他的尸體始終沒被發現 他的家也沒被毀
His body was never found His place wasn't trashed.

192
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,270
他不會就這么讓他的狗渴死 斯旺不是那種人
He wouldn't just leave his dog to die. Not who Swan was.

193
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,230
也許吧
Maybe.

194
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,480
也許他迅速逃跑
Or maybe he ran off so fast

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,610
因為他知道三個憤怒的士兵 和一頭怪獸會去找他
because he knew three pissed-off soldiers and a kaiju were coming for him.

196
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,780
狗受到了附帶傷害
Dog was collateral damage.

197
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,160
好吧 聽我說 我們不知道 110小組解散后 斯旺在忙什么
Okay, look, we don't know what Swan's been up to since the 110th ended. Right?

198
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
他可能缺錢 可能收臟錢
I mean, he could have money problems. He could have been taking payoffs.

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
如果有人告訴你我收臟錢 你會相信嗎
Would you believe it if somebody told you I was taking payoffs?

200
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,170
不會
No.

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,080
我只是說
I'm just saying

202
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,670
也許我們不像 我們想象中那么了解某些人
maybe we don't know some people as well as we think we do.

203
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,760
我招募的托尼斯旺 絕對不可能參與此事
There's no way the Tony Swan I recruited is a part of this.

204
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,380
不說了
End of story.

205
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,690
你看到我們拿出軍徽時 他們臉上的表情了嗎
See the look on their faces when we whipped out our badges?

206
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,980
他們看起來像比爾馬澤羅斯基
They looked like Ralph Terry

207
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,530
在第七場比賽中 打出本壘打時的拉夫爾特里
when Bill Mazeroski hit his game seven walk-off homer on him.

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,570
馬澤羅斯基 新規矩 孩子
Mazeroski? New rule, kid,

209
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,660
你不能引用
you can't reference

210
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,700
你出生十多年前的人的例子
shit from more than a decade before you were born.

211
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,030
滾開 海盜
Go, Bucs.

212
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,200
我們就快結案了
We're so close to wrapping up this case I can taste it.

213
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,040
你覺得他們會給我們什么  表揚 升職
What do you think they're gonna give us-- Commendations, promotions?

214
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,500
聽起來還不錯
I like the sound of that.

215
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,790
就此打住 少校
Pump the brakes, Major.

216
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,920
還有一大堆工作要做呢
There's still a hell of a lot of work ahead.

217
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,460
還要逮捕更多人 要拆除基礎設施
More arrests to be made. Infrastructure to dismantle.

218
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,590
調查跨越三大洲的 貨機 吉普車 直升機網絡
Whole networks of cargo planes, jeeps and helicopters across three continents.

219
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,550
老爺爺 慶祝勝利吧
Just take the W, Gramps.

220
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,850
不要辱罵長輩
Don't sass your elders.

221
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,390
就是 對他好點 他都不打瞌睡的
Yeah. Take it easy on him, guys. He hasn't had his nap yet.

222
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,060
好家伙 看來我們這里有象牙皂啊 雷徹
Damn. Looks like we got some Ivory Soap over here, Reacher.

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,980
什么意思
Meaning?

224
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,480
意思是 這玩意很純 會漂起來
Meaning this shit's so pure it floats.

225
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
有多純
How pure?

226
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,570
百分之九十九
Ninety-nine percent.

227
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,740
難怪到處都是迷上這玩意的孩子
No wonder kids are getting hooked on this shit left and right.

228
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,450
放松 體育迷們 不用站起來
At ease, sports fans, don't get up.

229
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,960
我聽說就快結案了
I hear congratulations are in order.

230
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,630
臥底買賣收獲頗豐啊
That's quite the buy 'n bust.

231
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,170
幾公斤的毒品
Kilos of poison

232
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,930
還有幾個被逮捕的毒販
and a handful of scumbag dealers off the streets

233
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,840
向我們出賣他們的朋友
and ratting on their friends for us.

234
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,390
這些都是小魚 我們很快就會釣到大魚的
These are the small fish. We'll catch the sharks soon enough.

235
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,520
你開始查這事的時候 我怎么跟你說的
What did I tell you when you started this thing?

236
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,850
“這個案子會是個怪物 所以關門放狗”
This case is gonna be a monster. Unleash the hounds.

237
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,440
看來你做到了
Seems you did.

238
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,860
說到怪物
Speaking of monsters,

239
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,820
霍滕斯四世怎么樣了
how's Hortense the Fourth?

240
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,530
二十個月前 已經進入可怕的兩歲期了
20 months, already into his terrible twos.

241
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,740
顯然 他是個神童
Apparently, he's a prodigy.

242
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,620
各位 干得好
Good work, everyone. Good work.

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,660
說起神童
Talking about a prodigy,

244
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,330
你就要達到百加得151里程碑了
you're about to hit your Bacardi milestone.

245
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,920
已經偵破151起案件了
151 cases closed.

246
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,380
在案子完成前 不要加到統計表里
Don't add it to the stats sheets till it's done.

247
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,670
我們這一行的人會被派往海外
People in our profession re sent overseas

248
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,970
在那里 我們會被槍擊 被轟炸 被簡易爆炸裝置炸飛
awhere we're shot at, bombed, blasted from IEDs.

249
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,010
然后這些混蛋會靠賣這玩意
Then these assholes make more money selling

250
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,350
賺的比我們所有人的養老金總和都多
this shit than all our pensions combined.

251
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,140
真不公平
It's fucked up.

252
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,730
我就說說而已
All I'm saying.

253
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,230
對了 48公斤值多少錢
How much is 48 bricks worth, anyway?

254
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,190
47
47.

255
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,860
少了一公斤 是47公斤 不是48公斤
one's missing. There's 47, not 48.

256
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,860
在調查中 細節很重要
In an investigation, details matter.

257
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,070
海洛因的數量是個細節
Brick of heroin's a hell of a detail.

258
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,080
那不可能 我在銷售點數過 是48公斤
That's impossible. I counted 48 at point of sale.

259
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,410
要么是你數錯了 要么就是有人遞錯了
Either you miscounted or they palmed one back to short you.

260
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,710
不會 只有新手才會犯這種錯誤
No, no, no. You do shit like that, you're not in the game for long.

261
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,920
我知道我們 往斯旺的車里裝了48公斤
I know we loaded 48 bricks into Swan's ride.

262
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,130
我們查查你的車
Let's check your car.

263
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,060
什么都沒有
Nothing.

264
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,410
謎團解開了
Mystery solved.

265
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,290
肯定是我開車的時候掉到后面卡住了
Must have fallen back there when I was driving and gotten stuck.

266
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,960
因為這個失誤 我猜今晚第一輪該我請客
Guess the first round's on me tonight for that fuckup.

267
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,260
掉了一公斤的海洛因 我得說應該請兩輪
Losing a key of H, I'd say that's worth two rounds.

268
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,770
什么
What?

269
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,230
沒什么
Nothing.

270
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,240
其實我都忘記這件事了 但這不支持你的論點
I'd actually forgotten about that, but it doesn't support your argument.

271
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,790
斯旺可能本來偷了毒品 而他只是驚慌失措 并將其歸還
Swan could have been stealing drugs and just panicked and gave them back.

272
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,410
也許他后悔錯過了這個賺大錢的機會
Maybe he regretted letting a chance at big money go by.

273
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,960
也許小翅膀項目來了
Maybe something like Little Wing came along

274
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,000
他不能再次錯過賺錢的機會
and he couldn't pass up that kind of opportunity again.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,340
有很多種可能 我的直覺告訴我他是個好人
That's a lot of maybes. My gut tells me he's a good man.

276
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,920
你的直覺以前從沒出過錯嗎
Your gut's never been wrong before?

277
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,300
你知道我是怎么想的嗎
You know what I think?

278
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,270
你希望斯旺是無辜的 因為是你招募他到110小組的
You want Swan to be innocent because you hired him into the 110th,

279
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,600
如果他參與此事 你會做一些蠢事
and if he's involved in something like this,

280
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,690
比如你會因為我們朋友的死而自責
you'd do something stupid like blame yourself for our friends' deaths.

281
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,940
而正如我所說 這樣很蠢
Which, like I said, would be stupid.

282
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,110
我們看看奧唐納發現了什么
Let's just see what O'Donnell found.

283
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,540
科羅拉多州丹佛

284
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,210
梅森先生 我是埃爾佐格比醫生
- Mr. Mason? - Dr. Elzogby.

285
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,790
我看了你的病歷 乍一看 我不得不說
So, I read your intake, and upon first glance, I got to say,

286
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,800
有幾個問題
got a few questions.

287
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,800
我和所有人一樣都喜歡錢 但你是個英俊的小伙子
Look, I like a payday as much as the next guy, but you're quite a handsome fella.

288
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,800
我不會告訴你該怎么過你的生活
Now, I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, but

289
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,970
但你真的想讓我給你整個新面孔嗎
are you really certain you want me to give you a new face?

290
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,350
從某種意義上來說
In a manner of speaking.

291
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,860
別掙扎
Don't struggle.

292
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,160
你是醫生 你知道發生了什么
You're a doctor, you know what's happening.

293
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,700
你的氣管被割破了
Your trachea is severed.

294
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,000
血液正在肺部 你快憋死了
Blood is entering your lungs, you're drowning,

295
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,920
你的大腦缺氧 神經系統停止工作
your brain is deprived of oxygen and your nervous system's shutting down.

296
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,000
所以現在你幾乎看不到我
So, by now, you can barely see me

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
現在你還聽不到我說話 而現在
and now you can't hear me and now...

298
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,930
你死了
...you're dead.

299
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,610
我要和你的秘書說句話
I'm just gonna go and have a word with your secretary.

300
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,080
曼努埃爾埃爾佐格比醫生 整容手術

301
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,210
今天所有預約取消

302
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,720
汽車旅館

303
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,430
丹尼爾博伊德 拉沃伊參議員的立法主任
Daniel Boyd, Senator Lavoy's legislative director.

304
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,350
被寵壞的蠢貨 一輩子從沒舉起過
Spoiled dipshit who's never lifted anything heavier

305
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,220
任何比灰雁酒瓶更重的東西
than a Grey Goose bottle in his life.

306
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,180
以C+的成績進入弗吉尼亞大學
C-plus student who got into UVA and Georgetown Law

307
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,980
和喬治敦法學院 這都多虧了他父母的關系
thanks to Mommy and Daddy's connections. Real party boy.

308
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,190
真正的派對男孩
Two dismissed DWIs in college.

309
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,270
大學期間兩個被撤銷的酒后駕車記錄

310
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,030
法學院第二年 他被抓到嫖娼
Second year of law school, gets caught with a sex worker.

311
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,190
指控神秘消失
Charges mysteriously disappeared.

312
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,490
平均成績2.3 直接進入私人律所
Took his 2.3 GPA straight into private practice.

313
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,200
而現在他負責起草 決定我們命運的法案
And now he drafts legislation that decides the fate of the free world,

314
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,040
讓他的老板給符合最會討好他的 游說者的利益的內容投票
telling his boss to vote on whatever benefits the lobbyists who wooed him best.

315
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,290
所以他含著金鑰匙出生
So, he was born somewhere between third and home base

316
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,080
從沒聽說過“后果”這個詞
and never heard the word "consequence."

317
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,670
你要用你那招 “比不道德差一點”的伎倆嗎
You gonna pull a few moves from your sleazy-adjacent playbook?

318
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,300
我就是這么想的
That's the general idea.

319
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,880
博伊德今晚將在波士頓 參加通俗樂團的籌款活動
Boyd's gonna be in Boston tonight for a fundraiser event at the Pops.

320
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,340
我們可以設個局 輕易拿捏他
We'll set him up like a bowling pin.

321
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,930
- 怎么  - 你竟然接電話了
Yeah. You pick up the phone.

322
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,480
我還以為你開車闖進那棟辦公樓時
I thought maybe you couldn't answer because you broke your hand

323
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,820
弄傷了手 所以沒法接呢
when you drove the fucking car through the office building.

324
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,820
我根本沒受傷
I didn't get hurt at all.

325
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,940
你覺得這很有趣嗎
You think this is funny?

326
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,360
我跟你說了 “別再搞牛仔那套”
I told you no more cowboy shit.

327
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,700
那輛車屬于他們的一名員工
The car belonged to one of their employees.

328
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,780
我是去還車的
I was returning it.

329
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,280
聽我說 大聰明
Listen, wiseass,

330
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,490
我的老大因為你們差點把我開除了
my boss almost punched my ticket because of you.

331
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,120
也許那是件好事
Well, maybe that's a good thing

332
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,580
因為我小隊的成員瀕臨死亡 而你什么都沒做
'cause members of my unit are falling from the sky like raindrops and you haven't done shit.

333
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,130
嘿 我想知道 你們從新時代得到的所有線索
Hey, hey. I want everything you got on New Age.

334
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,420
- 明白嗎  - 好的
- You understand? - Fine.

335
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,590
這就是我這次接電話的原因 我有理由跟你說話了
That's why I answered the phone this time. I actually have a reason to talk to you.

336
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,430
我會把他們的安保團隊名單發給你
I'm gonna send you their security team roster.

337
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,930
查一下這些人有什么聯系
Run background checks, see what connections these guys have.

338
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,510
等等 怎么 你覺得 我是來給你們做文書工作的
W... Wait, wait, wait. What do you think-- I'm here to do your clerical work?

339
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,430
是啊
Yup.

340
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,930
我們正忙著去波士頓
We're busy heading off to Boston.

341
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,270
波士頓有什么
What's in Boston?

342
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,350
交響樂
The symphony.

343
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,770
他媽的
Goddamn it.

344
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,070
但在我們去北邊之前 迪克森和我應該去跟馬洛伯恩斯談談
Before we head north, though, Dixon and I should go talk to Marlo Burns,

345
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,440
給她施點壓
step on her neck a little bit.

346
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,650
網上有地址
Address is online.

347
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,030
- 這就是為何我不買房子 - 是啊 好借口
Right there is why I don't have a house. Yeah, that's the reason.

348
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,790
那么 我們干活的時候 你們要做什么
So, while we do all the work, what are you guys gonna do?

349
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,120
我們要去拿些毒品
Oh, we're gonna go score some drugs.

350
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,430
你們好啊
Howdy.

351
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,770
- 見鬼  - 警察
Oh, shit. Five-O! Five-O!

352
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,680
真沒禮貌
Well, that's just rude.

353
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,360
你這周運氣不好
This just ain't your week.

354
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,340
混蛋 找份新工作吧
Find a new line of work, asshole.

355
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,930
她有個孩子
She's got a kid.

356
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,320
室內安全
House clear.

357
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,110
已確認
Affirmative.

358
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,200
有什么有趣的發現嗎
Anything interesting?

359
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,250
只有馬洛留下的一些昂貴的珠寶
I mean, just some expensive jewelry Marlo left behind.

360
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,370
留下的
Left behind?

361
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,000
你覺得她跑了
Think she bugged out?

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,710
她從后門出去了 門都沒鎖
She exited out the back door without locking it,

363
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,260
衣服扔得到處都是 顯然是匆忙打包的
clothes are all over, clearly packed in a hurry.

364
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,050
衣櫥和櫥柜是開著的
Closet and... cabinets are open.

365
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,230
她拿走了牙刷和牙膏
Well, she took her toothbrush and toothpaste.

366
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,530
綁匪通常不關心口腔衛生
Kidnappers don't care about oral hygiene.

367
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,410
簡是個玩家
Jane's a gamer.

368
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,240
品味不錯
Got good taste.

369
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,370
你可能想來看看這個
Uh, you might want to come and see this.

370
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,720
誰會逃跑的時候 不帶上儲備的現金啊
Who the hell goes on the lam and leaves their cash stash behind?

371
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,390
顯然 馬洛伯恩斯不會
Apparently, Marlo Burns.

372
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,140
確認一下 您預訂了一輛凱迪拉克凱雷德
So, to confirm, you've reserved a Cadillac Escalade,

373
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,650
三天后返還到肯尼迪機場 對嗎
to be returned within three days' time to JFK Airport.

374
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,600
科羅拉多州駕駛證 埃爾佐格比

375
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,730
沒錯
That's correct.

376
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,320
為了答謝老顧客
And to thank you for your loyalty,

謝謝惠顧 埃爾佐格比醫生 祝您旅途愉快
Thank you for your business, Dr. Elzogby. Have a wonderful drive.

380
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
你想要這個嗎
Would you like this?

381
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,930
你知道我為什么這么喜歡漫畫書嗎
Do you know why I love comic books so much?

382
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,430
馬薩諸塞州波士頓

383
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,980
看看你
Well, look at you.

384
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,650
你不覺得現在更文明了嗎 杜立特女士
Don't you feel more civilized now, Ms. Doolittle?

385
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,190
- 你之前穿的那身衣服在哪里  - 垃圾桶
Wait, where are the clothes you were wearing? Garbage.

386
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,320
垃圾桶 為什么
Garbage, why?

387
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,700
我已經提著靴子了
I'm already carrying boots.

388
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,080
如果我還有更多衣服的話 很快我就需要手提箱了
If I had any more clothes, pretty soon I'd need a suitcase.

389
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
要是我有了手提箱 我需要一個房子來存放它
I got a suitcase, I need a house to keep it in.

390
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,120
然后我還需要一輛車停在車道上
Then I need a car for the driveway.

391
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
很快 我就得填寫各種表格
Before you know it, I'm filling out all kinds of forms.

392
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,460
所以 對你來說 一件備用襯衫太累贅了
So, a spare shirt's just too much of an attachment for you?

393
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,380
有人診斷說你是反社會人格嗎
Anyone ever diagnose you as a sociopath?

394
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,470
診斷 沒有
Diagnosed? No.

395
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,100
那么 你覺得馬洛伯恩斯 為什么慌忙逃跑
So... what do you make of Marlo Burns taking off

396
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,060
只帶了幾件衣服 把所有現金都留下
with just some clothes and leaving all that cash behind?

397
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,600
我還不確定
Not sure yet.

398
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,310
她確實拿走了牙刷
Well, she did take her toothbrush.

399
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,230
她應該是你的靈魂伴侶吧
She could be your soul mate.

400
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,320
閉嘴
Shut up.

401
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,450
一個字都別說
Not one word.

402
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,990
- 天啊 - 那是兩個字了
Holy shit. That's two words.

403
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,040
再說一個字 我就把這個小高跟插進你屁眼里
Another one, and I'll shove this kitten heel right up your ass.

404
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,370
我只是說你很漂亮 你們倆都看起來不錯
I'm just saying you look nice. You both look nice.

405
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,290
我們看起來就像婚禮蛋糕上的混蛋
We look like the assholes on top of a wedding cake.

406
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,550
給 等我的養老金到賬 我會在一個月內還給你的
Here, I'll pay you back in a month when my pension lands.

407
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,090
你的養老金可買不起那套西服
Yeah, your pension won't cover that suit.

408
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,630
也付不起酒店房間 機票也付不起
Or the hotel room. Or the plane ticket.

409
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,220
我會在兩個月內還清
I'll pay you back in two months.

410
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,390
好的
Okay.

411
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,140
大家都準備好了嗎
Everyone ready?

412
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,480
我們去聽無聊的音樂吧
Let's go listen to some boring-ass music.

413
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,020
好的
Okay.

414
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,400
閉上嘴巴 老大 你的嘴巴大得都快進蒼蠅了
And, uh, close your mouth, boss. You're catching flies.

415
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,130
借過
Excuse me.

416
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,470
謝謝 對不起
Thank you. Pardon me.

417
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,390
- 借過 - 沒事
- Excuse me. - Of course. Okay.

418
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,560
不對 這...
Oh, no, it's...

419
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,100
- 抱歉 - 沒事
Apologies. Not at all.

420
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,650
對不起 我有點暈頭轉向的 我不知道我的座位
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm a little turned around. I don't know if I have

421
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,770
是在樂隊席還是在樓層包廂
orchestra seats or floor box seats,

422
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,030
我其實都不知道這是什么意思
and I actually don't even know what that means.

423
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,820
- 介意嗎  - 我們看看票上寫的什么
- Okay, well... - Do you mind? Let's just see what we got here.

424
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,240
- 夾層樓 那是你的位置... - 好的
Hmm, the mezzanine, that's where you are, but... Okay.

425
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,830
...但那座位可不怎么樣 你會想坐在這里
that just simply won't cut it. You see, you want to be down here.

426
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,370
聲音就像羊毛一樣包圍著你
The sound, it just wraps around you like a fleece.

427
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,750
等我的助手來了 你跟他換個位置吧
How about I swap your ticket with my aide when he arrives?

428
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,670
他不介意嗎
Wouldn't he mind?

429
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,670
他要是想保住工作 就不會介意
Well, not if he wants to keep his job.

430
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,800
請坐吧
Please, take a seat.

431
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,710
謝謝
Thank you.

432
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,850
穩操勝券
In the bag.

433
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,100
我們有13/14 8/13
We go 13/14s. 8/13s.

434
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,190
總共七個月 每周工作六天
Over seven months, six-day working weeks.

435
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,400
也許是一個記錄時間的時間表  也許是一種評級標準 我不知道
Maybe a time sheet clocking hours? Maybe a ratings scale? I don't know.

436
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,860
需要加水嗎
Top you off?

437
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,280
- 需要 - 需要 女士
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

438
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,740
還有 請把賬單拿給我 好嗎  這家伙沒錢
And when you get the chance, could you bring me the bill? This guy doesn't have any money.

439
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,780
當然可以 讓我幫你統計一下
Sure. Let me tally it up for you.

440
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,580
太棒了
Great.

441
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,620
這是統計
It's a tally.

442
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,700
什么
What?

443
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,660
這里
Here.

444
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,170
13/14
13/14ths.

445
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,380
某件事發生了13次 但本來應該發生14次
Something happened 13 times when it was supposed to happen 14 times.

446
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,800
這里 11次的13次 8次的11次
Uh, here, 11 out of 13. Eight out of 11.

447
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,470
嘿 伙計 我只是...
Hey, bud, I just...

448
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,800
好的 我怎么跟你說的
Okay, what did I tell you?

449
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,850
手是用來幫忙的 不是用來打人的
Hands are for helping, not hitting.

450
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,520
向你的兄弟道歉 把你的樂高給他玩 好嗎
Apologize to your brother. Share your Legos, okay?

451
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
我愛你
I love you.

452
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,060
我對你的愛可以往返月球
To the moon and back.

453
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,980
好的 再見了
Okay, bye for now.

454
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,570
對不起 我不知道 我為什么要給他們我的一次性手機號
Sorry, I don't know why I gave them my burner number, uh...

455
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,570
你看起來很開心
Well, you look happy.

456
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,450
我算了一下
I did the math.

457
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,290
有2197個事件 不管具體是什么事
There were 2,197 total events, whatever they were.

458
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,540
但只成功了1547次 但這個數字并不有趣
But they only succeeded 1,547 times. But that's not the interesting number.

459
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,290
看看他們有多少次 沒得到他們想要的結果
Look how many times they didn't get the outcome they wanted.

460
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,460
2197減去1547
2,197 minus 1,547.

461
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,010
650天啊
Six hundred and fifty. Holy shit.

462
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,970
六千五 每手十萬
Six fifty at 100K each.

463
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,550
這一切都以某種方式聯系在一起
It's all connected somehow.

464
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,600
那么...
So...

465
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,480
那么 “手是用來幫忙的”
So... hands are for helping?

466
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,610
你口袋里還裝著銅指虎
You have brass knuckles in your pocket.

467
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,070
我有《狗狗巡邏隊》的創可貼 還有操場的沙子
I got a PAW Patrol Band-Aid and some playground sand, too.

468
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,240
聽著 我不在的時候 他們不停地打電話 我...
Look, they call nonstop when I'm not there.

469
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,820
我在家的時候
And when I am there, it's, you know,

470
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,370
要早上7點去周末足球比賽
7:00 a.m. weekend soccer games,

471
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,740
參加教師會議
teacher conferences,

472
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,870
與妻子預訂的做愛
scheduled sex with the wife.

473
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,460
我不再孑然一身
I am no longer my own man.

474
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,670
你不會拿它換世界上任何東西
And you wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

475
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,210
六千五百萬美元都不行
Not for $65 million.

476
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,340
你徹底變了 奧唐納
You are a changed man, O'Donnell.

477
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,510
是啊 也許你應該試試
Yep. Maybe you should give it a go, huh?

478
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,760
買些土地 組建個家庭
Buy some land, start a family.

479
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,770
你會是親師會上最可怕的人 但你會是個好爸爸
You'd be the scariest guy at PTA, but you'd be a good dad.

480
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,270
- 要是我有土地 我會有四... - 四五條狗
- If I had land, I'd get four or five... - Four or five dogs.

481
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,520
你會有四五條狗 沒有女人
You'd get four or five dogs, no woman?

482
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,650
連迪克森都不要
Not even Dixon?

483
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,570
她是朋友
She's a friend.

484
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,410
好吧
Okay.

485
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,160
隨你怎么說吧 就像是一件衣服
Whatever you say. That was some dress, though.

486
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,660
是一件很好的衣服
Hell of a dress.

487
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,130
是內格利的消息 現在是中場休息
From Neagley. It's intermission.

488
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,710
迪克森和博伊德現在要走了
Dixon and Boyd are leaving now.

489
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
他們在那里
There they are.

490
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,430
真是一件很好的衣服啊
That's one hell of a dress.

491
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,600
我的車在拐角處 那樣可以嗎
My car's around the corner. Does that work?

492
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,060
我會跟著你走 美女
I'll follow anywhere you lead, gorgeous.

493
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,730
- 我們去派對吧 - 好的
- Well, let's go party. - Okay.

494
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,690
看看她
Look at her.

495
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,350
博伊德沒機會
Boyd didn't stand a chance.

496
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,610
又是內格利 她說我的人就位了
Neagley again. She says my guy's in place.

497
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,700
嘿 你的這位朋友會幫我們 對吧
Hey, this friend of yours. He's gonna come through for us, yeah?

498
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:27,120
如果他在軍隊的話 我會邀請他加入110小組
If he was in the Army, I'd have asked him to join the 110th.

499
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,000
過來
Come here.

500
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
你都興奮了
Oh, you're all riled up.

501
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,090
我能說什么 古典音樂讓我興奮
Well, what can I say? Classical music gets my motor running.

502
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,630
慢一點 極速賽車手 我們先來點前戲
Yeah, well, drop it to second, Speed Racer. Let's have a little primer first.

503
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,720
你不是在胡鬧 好吧
You're not messing around. All right.

504

Okay, hold this. Hold... hold that.

506
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,060
我一直不知道要弄多厚或者多薄...
I never know how thick or thin to make these things.

507
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,310
嘿 我來吧
Hey, allow me.

508
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,690
謝謝
Thank you.

509
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,910
好了 女士優先
Okay. Ladies first?

510
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,870
不 你弄的 你應該得到獎勵
Oh, no, you did the work, you get the reward.

511
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,990
恭敬不如從命
If you insist.

512
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,170
糟了 努力保持冷靜
Shit. Shit. Just-just play it cool, just play it cool. Just play it cool.

513
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,090
先生 你得把毒品收起來 然后下車
Sir, you're gonna want to put the drugs away and step out of the car.

514
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,060
那不是我的毒品
They're not my drugs.

515
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,270
哪些毒品
Which drugs--

516
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,770
你化妝鏡里的 還是你鼻子上的
the ones on your mirror or up your nose?

517
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,610
你覺得化妝鏡是我的嗎  全都是她的
You think I own a makeup mirror? They're all hers.

518
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,150
跟她說的不一樣 而且她又沒拿化妝鏡
Not what she's saying, and she wasn't holding it.

519
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,070
她已經提出進行血檢和尿檢
And she already offered up blood and urine.

520
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,820
你想進行血檢和尿檢嗎
Do you want to offer up blood and urine?

521
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,910
聽我說 長官
Listen, Officer,

522
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,740
我不愿意這么說 但你知道我是誰嗎
I hate putting it this way, but... do you know who I am?

523
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,950
我其實知道 博伊德先生
I do, actually, Mr. Boyd.

524
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,960
我還知道車里的那個女人 不是博伊德太太
And I know that woman in the car wasn't Mrs. Boyd.

525
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,250
我特別討厭那些
And I have a special distaste for people

526
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,510
不珍惜神圣的婚姻的人
who don't appreciate the sanctity of marriage.

527
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,340
我也知道你是拉沃伊參議員的手下
I also know you work for Senator Lavoy.

528
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,390
但我在系統里查你的名字時
But when I ran your name in the system,

529
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,970
觸發了當地聯邦調查局的警報
it set off bells and whistles at the local FBI office.

530
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,310
他們派了幾個人過來跟你聊聊
They sent a couple of their boys down here just to talk to you.

531
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,150
他們似乎并不在乎你的老板是誰
And it seems they don't care who your boss is.

532
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,950
我是杰克馬格雷福特工
Special Agent Jack Margrave.

533
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,370
這是布雷克特工
This is Special Agent Blake.

534
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,160
我是奧斯卡芬雷中尉
Lieutenant Oscar Finlay.

535
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,910
律師不在場 我不會說話
Yeah, I'm not talking without my lawyer.

536
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,370
你想請律師嗎
You want to lawyer up?

537
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,420
好的 給他打電話吧
Fine. Call them.

538
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,210
我會的 他們一小時內 就會把我弄出去
I will. And they'll have me out of here within the hour.

539
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,300
你知道
You know...

540
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,680
那就太晚了
...that's just gonna be too late.

541
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,840
因為等他們到這里時
Because by the time they get here,

542
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,760
我們就已經 在《環球報》和《先驅報》的頭版
we'll already have the story of a senator's legislative director

543
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,140
刊登了一位參議員的立法主任
in the wrong woman's car with a snout full of booger sugar

544
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,600
坐在錯誤的女人的車里 鼻子里全是可卡因的報道
on the front page of the Globe and the Herald.

545
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,610
你知道
You see,

546
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,360
這不是大學或法學院 孩子
this is not college or law school, son.

547
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,070
你也不是被寵壞的 勉強拿到C+的富家子弟
You're not some spoiled rich kid barely rocking a C-plus.

548
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,490
你現在是個政客
You're a Beltway man now.

549
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,910
是人們喜歡搞垮的那種人
Kind of guy that people enjoy knocking down a peg or two.

550
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,950
所以這些指控
So these charges,

551
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,580
它們可不會逃過大眾的法眼
they're not just gonna get swept under the rug.

552
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,000
我們不會讓他們這樣
We're not gonna let 'em.

553
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,130
想知道原因嗎
Want to know why?

554
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,670
好吧 為什么
Okay. Why?

555
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,960
因為我們不喜歡你
'Cause we don't like you.

556
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,720
我甚至都不知道你們為什么來這里
I don't even know why you're here.

557
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,010
我們在這里是因為 我們想知道關于小翅膀計劃的
We're here 'cause we want to know everything there is to know

558
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,930
所有信息
about Little Wing.

559
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,810
- 我也許應該... - 你應該
- I should probably... - Yeah, you should.

560
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,150
是啊 我要給 博伊德先生的妻子打電話
Yeah. I'm gonna call Mr. Boyd's wife.

561
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,690
她可能在華盛頓擔心他
Eh, she's probably worried about him over in D.C.

562
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,690
非常擔心
Worried sick.

563
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,530
老婆開心 生活舒心
You know, happy wife, happy life, huh?

564
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,110
好吧
Okay. Fine.

565
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,820
- 你好  - 我打錯了
- Hello? - Wrong number.

566
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,870
說話
Talk.

567
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,200
這沒什么大不了的
It's not that big of a deal.

568
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,830
小翅膀只是個代號
Little Wing is just a code name.

569
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,830
什么的代號
For what?

570
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,750
一項目前正在開發的新技術的代號
For a new technology currently in development.

571
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,880
一個令人難以置信的反導彈軟件
Some incredible anti-missile software

572
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,460
它最初是為保護商用飛機而開發的
originally developed to protect commercial aircraft,

573
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,380
但某個航空公司找到了我們
but a certain aeronautics company approached us.

574
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,840
讓我猜猜
Let me guess--

575
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,180
新時代
New Age?

576
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,890
是的 新時代
That's right. New Age.

577
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,930
他們發現該軟件可以做些調整
They found the software could be tweaked.

578
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,600
它可以用于導彈中 而且不僅僅是針對它們
It could be used in missiles and not just against them.

579
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,600
它還可以縮小
It could be scaled down

580
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,360
安裝在便攜式肩扛式地對空武器中
and installed in portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air weaponry.

581
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,440
這個軟件能讓導彈擊破
The software allows missiles to defeat

582
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,940
- 所有已知的對抗措施 - 怎么做到的
all known countermeasures. How?

583
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,110
那是穿著實驗室制服的 書呆子才會問的問題
That's a question for a nerd in a lab coat, man.

584
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,780
好吧 我只知道
Okay? All I know is

585
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,870
從地面發射的導彈 能完全繞過它們的目標
that missiles shot from the ground completely bypass their target,

586
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,540
讓飛行員相信威脅已經過去
making pilots believe the threat has passed,

587
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,920
然后它們重新校準 轉身
and then they recalibrate, turn around,

588
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,290
重新瞄準飛機 重新進行攻擊
zero back in on the aircraft and reattack.

589
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,170
這必死無疑 無法避免
It's death from above and there is no way to avoid it.

590
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,720
你開火 就能射中目標 就是這樣
You fire, you hit your target. Period.

591
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,640
那拉沃伊參議員參與了什么
And what's Senator Lavoy's involvement?

592
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,810
項目需要一個撥款法案 好嗎
Well, the project required an appropriation bill, all right?

593
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,140
你想要通過一個法案
You want to get one passed?

594
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,520
就得面對多年的繁文縟節
You're looking at years of bureaucratic bullshit

595
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,230
這都要歸功于一些 關于修改民用技術的古怪法律
all thanks to some arcane laws on modifying civilian tech.

596
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,900
但拉沃伊知道小翅膀 會帶領我們的軍隊走向未來
But Lavoy knew Little Wing would slingshot our military into the future,

597
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,200
所以如果我們袖手旁觀
so if we just sat on our hands,

598
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,700
等待申請通過正規渠道
waiting for it to go through the proper channels,

599
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,990
那永遠都無法落實
it would never happen.

600
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,540
所以我猜拉沃伊沒有以最體面的方式
So I'm assuming Lavoy didn't clear up the red tape

601
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,620
清除繁文縟節
in the most reputable manner?

602
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,670
我幫忙把提案塞進了 一份一千頁的法規中
I helped bury the proposal in a thousand-page statute

603
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,170
與此同時 拉沃伊負責握手拉選票
while Lavoy shook hands and drummed up votes.

604
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,840
甚至都沒人知道法案里有這個
No one even knew it was in there.

605
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,130
他純粹是好心做這事
And he did this out of the goodness of his heart?

606
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,510
為了保護民主
To protect democracy?

607
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,520
沒有收紅包之類的
No fat envelopes slipped inside newspapers on park benches?

608
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,270
成熟點 好嗎
Grow the fuck up, okay?

609
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,230
這是華盛頓特區 這是辦事的規矩
It's D.C. It's how shit gets done.

610
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,900
此外 拉沃伊知道小翅膀會拯救生命
Besides, Lavoy knew Little Wing would save lives.

611
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,230
我的意思是
I mean...

612
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,150
每個人都嘲笑星球大戰的防御計劃
everyone made fun of the Star Wars defense program,

613
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,700
但看看我們現在的處境
but, hey, look at where we are now.

614
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,660
每個人都想從空中發射炮彈
Everyone's trying to shoot projectiles out of the air.

615
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,160
小翅膀可以擊中空中的任何物體
Little Wing can knock anything out of the sky.

616
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,460
任何物體
Anything?

617
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,090
比如商用飛機
Like commercial aircraft?

618
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,840
你開火 就能擊中目標
You fire, you hit the target.

619
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,670
- 你自己說的 - 對 但這是我們的技術 歸我們所有
You said so yourself. Yeah, but it's our tech. We have it.

620
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,590
其他人都無法得到它
Nobody else can get their hands on it.

621
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,890
你們想的那種事是不會發生的
Nothing like you're thinking is going to happen.

622
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,520
新時代非常安全 他們的兩個場所都采用了
New Age is incredibly secure. Both of their facilities

623
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,930
- 最先進的... - 兩個場所
- implement state-of-the-art... - Both facilities?

624
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,310
什么意思
What do you mean?

625
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,850
新時代有兩個基地
New Age has two bases.

626
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,060
軟件是在紐約開發的
Software made in New York,

627
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,650
硬件是在丹佛的制造工廠制造的
hardware at a manufacturing plant in Denver.

628
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,780
還有什么
What else can you tell us?

629
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,360
沒了 我發誓我就知道這些
Nothing. That's all I know. I swear.

630
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,620
嘿 拉沃伊和我 我們走了捷徑
Hey, Lavoy and me-- we-we cut some corners,

631
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,990
我們確實做了一些不該做的事
we did some stuff we should not have done,

632
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,370
但這都是為了讓國防法案通過
but it was all to get a defense bill passed,

633
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,710
保護國家
protect the country.

634
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,250
那結果如何
How'd that work out?

635
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,840
嘿 抱歉 所以毒品指控會被撤銷嗎
Hey, excuse me. So, are the drug charges getting dropped or what?

636
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,300
我不知道 我不是警察
I don't know. I'm not a cop.

637
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,690
真意外 居然接到你的電話
Heck of a surprise getting a call from you.

638
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,650
聽說你又戴上警徽了 真是太意外了
Hell of a surprise hearing you're wearing the badge again.

639
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,980
中尉 彼此彼此
Lieutenant, no less.

640
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,110
是啊 退休可不適合我
Yeah, well, retirement didn't suit me.

641
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,570
說起來 我看你還穿著呢子大衣
Speaking of suits, see you're still sporting the tweed.

642
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,570
一如既往的可靠 芬雷
Reliable as ever, Finlay.

643
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,620
你是說你自己吧
Speak for yourself.

644
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,120
我們初次見面時 你跟我說了什么
What was it you told me when we first met--

645
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
“麻煩似乎總是找上你”
trouble always seems to find you?

646
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,630
你殺了很多人嗎
You kill a whole lot of people?

647
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,880
- 時不時 - 需要幫忙嗎
Here and there. You need my help?

648
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
你已經幫我了
Already gave it.

649
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,720
你還在轉那枚結婚戒指嗎
You still spinning that wedding ring?

650
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,970
時不時 但感覺一天比一天好
Here and there. But feeling better every day.

651
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,390
- 狗呢  - 杰克很能吃
- And the dog? - Jack eats too much.

652
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,640
狗如其名
Just like his namesake.

653
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,110
今天 老大 汽車正在行駛 如果我不盡快脫掉這件緊身衣
Today, boss. Car's running, and if I don't get out of this straitjacket soon,

654
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,860
- 事情會變得很難看的 - 內格利
things are gonna get ugly. Neagley?

655
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,820
我都沒認出你 看起來很美
Didn't recognize you. Looking good.

656
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,030
別多管閑事 補丁男
Mind your business, elbow patches.

657
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,280
你聽到這位女士說的了
Hey, you heard the lady.

658
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,490
如果我20分鐘內不讓她穿上牛仔褲
If I don't have her in jeans in 20 minutes,

659
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,830
我就完蛋了
I'm done for.

660
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,330
回見 雷徹
See you around, Reacher.

661
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,330
回見 芬雷
See you around, Finlay.

662
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,350
所以小翅膀可能會鑄就下一起911
So, Little Wing could be our next 9/11.

663
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,560
我們的指令是什么
What are our directives?

664
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,140
你和迪克森去丹佛
You and Dixon go to Denver.

665
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,600
小翅膀軟件需要導彈硬件
The Little Wing software is useless without the missile hardware,

666
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,060
那是硬件的制造地
and that's where it's made.

667
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,690
也許你們可以干擾一下 以免導彈落入壞人之手
Maybe you can gum up the works, keep the missiles out of the wrong hands.

668
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,230

O'Donnell and I will head down to D.C.

669

我想去國土安全局 看看他們是否知道AM的事
Want to swing by Homeland, see what they know about A.M.

670
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,990
如果他的作案手法是將人扔出飛機 他們可能有些情報
If taking out airplanes is his M.O., they might have some intel on him.

671
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,490
我們要怎么做
How do you figure we're gonna do that?

672
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,080
你覺得我們就直接敲門說 “國防部能出來玩嗎 ”
You think we're just gonna knock on the door and say, "Can the DoD come out and play?"

673
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,000
我兄弟在國土安全局工作
My brother worked for Homeland.

674
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,330
他的聯系人能幫到我們
His contacts can help us.

675
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,130
對哦 喬最近過得怎么樣
Oh, no shit. How's Joe doing these days?

676
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,380
他死了
He's dead.

677
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,720
我餓了 我們應該吃飯
I'm starving. We should eat.

678
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,610
牛排大師 新鮮食品餐廳及肉店

679
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,990
我有權用浴室 我得換衣服
Dibs on the bathroom. I need to get changed.

680
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,500
是嗎 你要把這衣服扔進垃圾桶 就像這位反社會朋友一樣嗎
Yeah? You gonna throw it in the garbage like our sociopathic friend here?

681
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,790
不會 怎么 你想借
Oh, why, you want to borrow it?

682
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,620
是啊 我很喜歡
Oh, yeah. I got the ass for it.

683
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,260
我很討厭破壞舞會之夜
Hate to ruin prom night,

684
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,720
但交出你們的槍
but hand over your guns.

685
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,730
你為什么覺得我們有槍
What makes you think we have guns?

686
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,940
有人跟我們說你們有槍 雷徹
We were told you'd be packing, Reacher.

687
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,740
他們還跟你說 今晚你會死嗎
They also tell you you'd die tonight?

688
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,410
我會死 真搞笑
I'll die? That's funny.

689
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,830
沒有槍 所以沒有噪音
No guns, so no noise.

690
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,330
他們說你們很聰明
They said you were smart.

691
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,000
我要砍死你
I'm gonna cut you,

692
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,500
割了你
gut you

693
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,590
讓你...
and leave you...

694
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,630
大家都還好嗎
Everyone okay?

695
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
還好 會愈合的
Yeah. It'll heal.

696
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,930
不能更好了
Never better.

697
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,100
我的鞋壞了
Fucked up my shoes,

698
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,310
但我沒事
but I'm fine.

699
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,950
嗯
Yeah.

700
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,820
不用你問出口 已經完事了
Before you ask if it's done, it is,

701
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,370
只是跟你希望的方式不同
just not in the way you hoped for.

702
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,160
你造成了很多復雜的問題
You're causing a very complex operation a lot of problems.

703

Sixty-five million dollars worth, Langston?

704
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,000
我猜你就是蘭斯頓吧
Assume that's who I'm talking to.

705
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,920
安保部老大
Head of security?

706
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,170
整件事的老大
Head of this whole thing?

707
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,800
也許我們一直在用 錯誤的方式處理此事 雷徹先生
Maybe we've been approaching this the wrong way, Mr. Reacher.

708
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,300
叫我雷徹
Just Reacher.

709
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,140
好吧 雷徹 不如我們做筆交易吧
Okay, Reacher. Why don't we make a deal?

你想要什么我都能給你
I have the means to give you anything you could ask for.

我想把你扔出直升機
