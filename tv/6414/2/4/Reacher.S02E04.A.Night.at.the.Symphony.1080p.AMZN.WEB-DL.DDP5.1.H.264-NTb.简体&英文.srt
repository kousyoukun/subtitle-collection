1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,630
《烈探雷彻》前情提要
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,670
他说:“六千五 每手十万”
He said 650 at 100K each.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,300
可能是六千五百万的转账 六千五百万的掩饰费
It could be a transfer of 65 million, a $65 million cover-up,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,890
六千五百万的贿赂款
a $65 million bribe.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,930
我们找到了一个嫌疑人
We got a suspect.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,050
阿扎里马哈茂德
Azhari Mahmoud.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,770
国际刑警组织 知道他是恐怖组织的武器经纪人
He's known to Interpol as a weapons broker for terrorist organizations.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,640
“他如幽灵一般 任何地方都没有他的照片”
He's a ghost. No pictures of him anywhere.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,020
如果这些是分数 那写下这些数字的人就太粗心了
If these are supposed to be fractions, then it's sloppy work.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,610
每张纸上有26或27个数字列表
On each sheet there's 26 or 27 numerical tabulations.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,740
真正的问题是 他们在算什么事的时间
So, the real question is what kind of somethings were they counting?

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,950
今晚你不必孤单
You don't have to be lonely tonight.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,660
在大西洋城的时候 有杀手曾经想杀了我们
There were hit men who tried to kill us in Atlantic City.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,370
他们失败了 但他们有一张 叫新时代的公司的停车证
They failed, but they had a parking pass for a company called New Age.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,830
新时代是一家航空航天公司
New Age is an aerospace company.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,130
我是马洛伯恩斯 新时代的运营总监
I'm Marlo Burns, New Age Director of Operations.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,460
停车证被发给了 一个叫特雷弗萨罗皮安的男人
The parking pass was issued to a man named Trevor Saropian.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,630
- 他的车在哪儿  - 我们决定把车带走
- Where's his car? - We decided to take it with us.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,010
天啊 是斯旺
Holy shit. It's Swan.

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,310
他曾在新世纪工作
He was working at New Age

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,390
跟一直想杀了我们的这群人一起
with the people who've been trying to kill us.

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,440
餐厅

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,940
真棒 我们开车撞破窗户
Great. Well, we drove a car through a window

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,940
这样我就可以阅读 一位五年前在新时代
so that I could read workers comp pleadings

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,030
滑倒的秘书的工伤赔偿诉状了
for a secretary who slipped on New Age stairs five years ago.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,780
真开心我们为此冒着坐牢的风险
So glad we risked prison for that.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,990
是啊 我也一无所获 没有新线索
Yeah, I got nothing, too. No new information.

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,500
我倒是觉得我们发现了一些新线索
Well, I wouldn't say we haven't found any new information.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,880
我们有三名特别调查员死亡
I mean, we've got three special investigators dead,

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,790
一名在逃
one in the wind,

31
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,420
而失踪的那位刚好在新时代工作过
and the one who's missing just happens to be the one who worked for New Age.

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,180
怎么了 总得有人说出来
What? Look, someone's got to say it.

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,760
斯旺是这些人的同事还是同谋
Was Swan working with these guys or with these guys?

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,600
斯旺是良民
Swan's not dirty.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,020
- 我们都想相信他没... - 我了解斯旺 我们都了解
- Look, man, we all want to believe that he isn't... - I know Swan. We all do.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,150
你觉得那一点可能性都没有吗
And you don't think there's even a chance...

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,030
绝不可能
No. I don't.

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,780
专注于我们的发现
Focus on what we found.

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
“布拉德”
Brad?

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,500
史黛西
Stacy?

41
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,960
我说的是这种“布拉德”
This is a brad.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,380
那是紧固件 这么小的东西 居然有两个名字 太蠢了
That is a fastener. Two names for something that size is stupid.

43
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,050
这段对话也很蠢
So is this conversation.

44
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,550
说起名字
Well, speaking of names,

45
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,100
我刚在员工目录中 发现了我们的人的名字
just found our man in the employee directory.

46
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,520
看来斯旺的职位是安全总监助理
Seems Swan's title was assistant director of security.

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,060
“谢恩兰斯顿 安全总监”
Shane Langston, director of security.

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,400
也许在大西洋城 跟我通话的就是这个人
Maybe he's the guy I got on the phone in Atlantic City.

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,480
何出此言
Why would you say that?

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,400
他是安全部门的老大 负责发号施令
He's the security boss and bosses give orders

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,610
我们杀掉的那些人 接到命令要干掉我们
and the guys we killed had orders to take us out.

52
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,700
这只是推测 他可能是 让斯旺陷入这一切的罪魁祸首
Just a theory. He could be the guy that got Swan caught up in all this.

53
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,080
如果不是斯旺先让他卷进去的话
Well, if Swan didn't pull him into it first...

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,710
- 我已经跟你说了... - 你不是说假设害死人吗
I already told you... Aren't you the guy that said that assumptions kill?

55
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,830
你在假设斯旺 离开110小组后没有变化
Well, you're assuming that Swan's the same guy he was back in the 110.

56
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,050
嘿 这就是雷彻 在萨罗皮安家外面追的那个人
Hey, this is the guy Reacher chased down outside of Saropian's house.

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,260
跟他身份证的照片一致
Same photo as his ID badge.

58
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,720
副安全官员
Associate security officer.

59
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,850
真不错
Well, that's great.

60
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,970
斯旺 柯林斯
Swan, Collins,

61
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,890
两名新时代的安全部门人员与此有关
that's two New Age security personnel somehow involved in this.

62
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,230
- 现在我们得调查所有这些混蛋 - 别忘了马洛伯恩斯
Now we got to look into all these fuckers. Don't forget Marlo Burns.

63
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,610
是她置我们于险境 她给了我们萨罗皮安的地址
She knew she was sending us right into a buzzsaw when she gave us Saropian's address.

64
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,480
所以整个公司都很可疑
So, the entire company's suspect.

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,190
这个公司有一千多名员工 我们怎么查这么多人
We got over a thousand employees. How we gonna tackle that?

66
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,370
一次一个
One at a time.

67
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,460
烈探雷彻
第二季第四集

68
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,460
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

69
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,050
纽约市

70
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,010
昨晚 你申请了 某国防公司的深夜搜查令
Last night you asked for a late night warrant for some defense firm,

71
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,310
而一个小时后 这地方就发生了入室盗窃
and an hour later, the place is hit with a smash-and-grab.

72
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,930
你知道这让我们看起来像什么吗
Okay, do you know how that makes this department look?

73
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,940
就好像我们步步落后一样
Like we're five steps behind everything.

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,690
我收集到了足够多的证据 才申请的搜查令
I made those applications when I had enough for a warrant.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,030
而在你等待搜查令的时候 你本该从那里收集的证据
And while you were waiting for them, all the evidence that you would have collected

76
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,990
已经全部被带走了
from that place is all cleaned out.

77
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,700
我跟你打赌 就是那些
And I'll bet you that it is those tin soldiers

78
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,780
给你打出黑眼圈的破军人干的
that you were supposed to be keeping your black eye on.

79
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,540
不是那群军队混混干的 我跟他们说得很清楚
It wasn't the army brats. I made it crystal clear to them

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,460
- 让他们守规矩  - 我知道了
not to color outside the lines. Oh, I see.

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,000
你觉得你好好跟他们说话 他们就会配合
You thought, if you told them nicely, they'd play along?

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,920
你是纽约市警察局的
You're NYPD.

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,420
天啊 这些人都是他妈的私家侦探
These are fucking PIs, for Chrissakes.

84
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,090
这超出你的能力范围了吗 拉索
Is this too fucking much for you, Russo?

85
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,720
中尉 小声点
Lieutenant, lower your voice.

86
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,550
小声点
Lower my voice?

87
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,850
你让我在我自己的办公室里 讲话小声点
You're telling me to lower my voice in my own fucking office?

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,770
好吧
Okay.

89
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,850
请你去了解一下 他们都发现了什么 好吗
Would you please go and find out what they learned, all right?

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,480
我这么说话够客气了吧 拉索
Am I asking you nicely enough, Russo?

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,190
- 我会处理好的 - 很好
I'll get it handled. Great.

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
关门
Close the door.

93
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,870
谁放的这首歌
Who put this song on?

94
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,420
这是传声头像乐队的歌
This is the Talking Heads.

95
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,290
你跟传声头像乐队有仇吗  我们现在在纽约呢
You got beef with the Talking Heads? We're in New York.

96
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,540
他们是纽约的乐队
They're a New York band.

97
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,460
搬到了纽约的罗德岛乐队
They're a Rhode Island band that moved to New York

98
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,970
没 我跟他们没仇 只是
and no, I don't have a beef with them. It's just...

99
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,510
《此路不通》  刚好我们坐在这儿毫无进展
"Road to Nowhere," when we're sitting here getting nowhere,

100
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,970
貌似有点晦气
seems a little defeatist.

101
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,520
而且这不是他们最好的歌
Besides, it's not even their best song.

102
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,020
我更喜欢《变态杀手》
Probably prefer "Psycho Killer."

103
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,480
我可能找到线索了
Um, I might have something.

104
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,940
我一直在找U盘里 所有和斯旺有关的内容
I've been scrubbing the drives for everything Swan-related.

105
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
- 然后呢  - 我发现了一件反常的事
- And? - And I found an anomaly.

106
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,030
他是安全总监助理
He's the assistant director of security,

107
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,660
他所有的电子邮件 都抄送了他的上司兰斯顿
so all of his emails have Langston-- his boss--

108
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,280
以及其他六名安保人员
and a half-dozen other security personnel cc'd on them.

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,660
合情合理 他们是一个团队 得共享信息
Makes sense. I mean, they're a team. They share information.

110
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,540
但他没有分享一切
But he didn't share everything.

111
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,210
有几封邮件是斯旺 和我们的老朋友马洛伯恩斯的
There are multiple emails between Swan and our old friend Marlo Burns.

112
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,040
只有他们俩 没有抄送其他人
Just them. No one else copied.

113
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,960
是关于什么的
About what?

114
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,760
音乐 但又不全是
Music, but not really.

115
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,170
你怎么知道
How do you know?

116
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,670
他写道
He wrote,

117
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,010
“前几天我在听一张专辑
"I was listening to an album the other day,

118
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,310
“我觉得你可能会喜欢 吉米亨德里克斯的《大胆如爱》
thought you might like it. Jimi Hendrix, Bold as Love.

119
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,480
“第六首歌太赞了 听听看 告诉我你的想法”
The sixth song is amazing. Take a listen, tell me what you think."

120
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
斯旺很讨厌亨德里克斯 他讨厌任何吵闹的吉他曲...
Swan hated Hendrix. Anything with hard guitar.

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,900
不弹斯金纳德 齐柏林 亨德里克斯和谁人乐队的歌
No Skynyrd, no Hendrix, no Zeppelin, no Who.

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,490
- 这是他的原则 - 他没有让其他人看这封邮件
I mean, that was his rule. He's leaving everyone else off the email

123
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,110
而他在邮件里说他喜欢 我们知道他讨厌的东西
and saying he loved something we know he hated.

124
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,110
可能是暗号
Could be code.

125
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,580
或者也可能是春心萌动
Or it could be a guy trying to get laid.

126
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,500
我曾经跟一个女孩说 我喜欢乔治亚欧姬芙
I mean, I once told a girl I loved Georgia O'Keeffe.

127
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,580
我们会说这种话
We say things.

128
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,170
是的 我查到第六首歌叫《小翅膀》
Yeah. It says the sixth track is called "Little Wing."

129
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,340
等等
Hold on.

130
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,680
- 我说过你很聪明吗 内格利  - 还远远不够
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley? Not nearly enough.

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,930
这里 这是一份联邦国防项目的文件 项目名叫“小翅膀”
Right here. A file on a federal defense project called Little Wing,

132
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,520
这是迄今为止 新时代签下的最大的合同
by far the biggest contract New Age has ever had.

133
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,020
是我在其他记录中见过的四倍
Four times the size of anything I've seen anywhere else in their records.

134
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,520
一份九位数的合同
A nine-figure contract.

135
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,110
人们为了更少的利益杀人
People have murdered for less.

136
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,150
看看这份办公室内部备忘录
Look at this interoffice memo.

137
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,450
他们似乎为一些军事要员 甚至包括一位参议员
Seems a test for the Little Wing tech was held for some military brass,

138
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,570
对小翅膀科技进行了测试
even a senator.

139
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,450
什么测试 在哪儿测的
But what kind of test? And where?

140
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,410
上面没写
Doesn't say,

141
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,620
但他们确实指出 参议员马尔科姆拉沃伊
but they do note that Senator Malcolm Lavoy

142
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,170
保证他会获得国会的选票 让小翅膀变成现实
assured he would do all he could to get the congressional votes to make Little Wing a reality.

143
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,250
我引用原文
And I quote,

144
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,710
“他完全相信我们 在新时代做的这项工作
"He fully believes in the work we're doing here at New Age

145
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,550
“并且会不惜一切代价帮助我们”
and will do whatever it takes to help us."

146
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,590
如果你给的钱够多 拉沃伊连《芝麻街》的史纳菲都信
Lavoy would fully believe in Snuffleupagus you pay him enough.

147
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,880
你知道这个人
You know this guy?

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,100
有所耳闻 在华盛顿特区 拉沃伊被称为“纸袋”
By reputation. In D.C., Lavoy's what's known as a paper bag.

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,470
他的政治方针和投票都飘忽不定
His politics and his vote go whichever way the wind's blowing.

150
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,270
众所周知 他会做见不得人的事
He's known to do some shady shit.

151
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,520
所以如果新时代能靠政府合同发财
So, if New Age stands to make a fortune on

152
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,820
而拉沃伊是他们在国会的拥护者
a government contract and Lavoy is his champion in Congress,

153
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,530
这就说明新时代 让拉沃伊的口袋装得满满的
it stands to reason New Age is the wind blowing Lavoy's bag.

154
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,940
这听起来不对
That sounds wrong.

155
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,410
所以 失踪且尚不清楚 是否是良民的斯旺
So, Swan, who's missing, maybe dirty, maybe not,

156
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,080
给之前想杀了我们的马洛伯恩斯
is code-texting Marlo Burns, who tried to have us killed

157
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
发了含有代码的邮件
about a program supported

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,960
其内容是关于 一个道德败坏的政客支持的项目
by an ethically-compromised politician.

159
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,420
我们得跟马尔科姆拉沃伊谈谈
We need talk to Malcolm Lavoy.

160
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,500
我们永远没法接近参议员 从他口中套话
We'll never get close enough to a senator to find out what he may or may not know.

161
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,970
我们不需要接近他 这些人 从来都不清楚自己在给什么投票
Oh, we don't need to. Those guys never even know what they're voting for.

162
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,930
一千页的法案 立法记录 他们不会读那些东西的
Thousand-page bills, the legislative record, they don't read that stuff.

163
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,430
他们只会按照被告知的方式投票 但他的立法主任
They just vote the way they're told to. But his legislative director--

164
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,520
实际上是他们制定并起草法案
they're the guys who actually craft and draft the laws,

165
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,480
这对我们有利 因为这些人没有安保人员
which is good for us because those guys have no security detail.

166
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,190
这些人为什么要跟我们说呢
Okay, but why would those people talk to us?

167
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,820
我可以让他们说话 让他们求着告诉我们他们知道的事
I can make it so they'll be begging to tell us what they know.

168
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,820
你有什么想跟我们分享的事情吗
Something you want to share with the class?

169
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,370
听着 华盛顿特区有很多有权势的人
Look, there's a lot of powerful people in D.C. with, uh...

170
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,120
都有见不得光的事
confidential problems.

171
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,880
主要是不大光彩 但是合法的
Mainly unsavory, but legal, things they do

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,170
是一些他们不愿公开的私人行为
in private that they'd rather not get made public.

173
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,130
我的工作就是 确保他们的私事永不见光
My job is to make sure that their personal business stays personal.

174
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,050
而知道秘密的人会保守住这些秘密
And the people who know secrets, they keep those secrets.

175
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,050
所以 你敲诈勒索
So, you blackmail?

176
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,510
我是激励他们
I incentivize.

177
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,140
听起来很不道德 奥唐纳
Sounds sleazy, O'D.

178
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,970
比不道德差那么一点
It's sleazy-adjacent.

179
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,980
嘿 我得付私立学校的学费 好吗
Hey, I got private school tuition to pay for, okay?

180
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,230
我从不违法
I never break the law.

181
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,690
我只是把事实摆在人们面前 让他们知道
I simply present the facts to people and let them know

182
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,900
如果他们做错了选择会发生什么
which way the river's gonna flow if they choose the wrong course of action.

183
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
给我十分钟打几个电话
You give me ten minutes to make some phone calls, I'll get

184
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,990
我会找到立法主任的名字 和他的致命弱点
the name of the legislative director and an Achilles' heel.

185
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,620
动手吧
Do it.

186
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,080
好的
All right.

187
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,170
谢谢
Thank you.

188
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,260
我知道你不想说斯旺...
Reacher, I know you don't want to talk about Swan...

189
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,970
斯旺是清白的 如果他有问题 他不会像其他人一样消失
Swan's clean. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have disappeared like the rest of the guys.

190
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,390
但他并没有像其他人一样消失
But he didn't disappear like the rest of the guys.

191
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,680
他的尸体始终没被发现 他的家也没被毁
His body was never found His place wasn't trashed.

192
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,270
他不会就这么让他的狗渴死 斯旺不是那种人
He wouldn't just leave his dog to die. Not who Swan was.

193
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,230
也许吧
Maybe.

194
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,480
也许他迅速逃跑
Or maybe he ran off so fast

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,610
因为他知道三个愤怒的士兵 和一头怪兽会去找他
because he knew three pissed-off soldiers and a kaiju were coming for him.

196
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,780
狗受到了附带伤害
Dog was collateral damage.

197
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,160
好吧 听我说 我们不知道 110小组解散后 斯旺在忙什么
Okay, look, we don't know what Swan's been up to since the 110th ended.

198
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
他可能缺钱 可能收脏钱
Right? I mean, he could have money problems. He could have been taking payoffs.

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
如果有人告诉你我收脏钱 你会相信吗
Would you believe it if somebody told you I was taking payoffs?

200
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,170
不会
No.

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,080
我只是说
I'm just saying

202
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,670
也许我们不像 我们想象中那么了解某些人
maybe we don't know some people as well as we think we do.

203
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,760
我招募的托尼斯旺 绝对不可能参与此事
There's no way the Tony Swan I recruited is a part of this.

204
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,380
不说了
End of story.

205
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,690
你看到我们拿出军徽时 他们脸上的表情了吗
See the look on their faces when we whipped out our badges?

206
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,980
他们看起来像比尔马泽罗斯基
They looked like Ralph Terry

207
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,530
在第七场比赛中 打出本垒打时的拉夫尔特里
when Bill Mazeroski hit his game seven walk-off homer on him.

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,570
马泽罗斯基 新规矩 孩子
Mazeroski? New rule, kid,

209
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,660
你不能引用
you can't reference

210
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,700
你出生十多年前的人的例子
shit from more than a decade before you were born.

211
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,030
滚开 海盗
Go, Bucs.

212
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,200
我们就快结案了
We're so close to wrapping up this case I can taste it.

213
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,040
你觉得他们会给我们什么  表扬 升职
What do you think they're gonna give us-- Commendations, promotions?

214
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,500
听起来还不错
I like the sound of that.

215
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,790
就此打住 少校
Pump the brakes, Major.

216
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,920
还有一大堆工作要做呢
There's still a hell of a lot of work ahead.

217
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,460
还要逮捕更多人 要拆除基础设施
More arrests to be made. Infrastructure to dismantle.

218
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,590
调查跨越三大洲的 货机 吉普车 直升机网络
Whole networks of cargo planes, jeeps and helicopters across three continents.

219
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,550
老爷爷 庆祝胜利吧
Just take the W, Gramps.

220
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,850
不要辱骂长辈
Don't sass your elders.

221
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,390
就是 对他好点 他都不打瞌睡的
Yeah. Take it easy on him, guys. He hasn't had his nap yet.

222
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,060
好家伙 看来我们这里有象牙皂啊 雷彻
Damn. Looks like we got some Ivory Soap over here, Reacher.

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,980
什么意思
Meaning?

224
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,480
意思是 这玩意很纯 会漂起来
Meaning this shit's so pure it floats.

225
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
有多纯
How pure?

226
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,570
百分之九十九
Ninety-nine percent.

227
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,740
难怪到处都是迷上这玩意的孩子
No wonder kids are getting hooked on this shit left and right.

228
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,450
放松 体育迷们 不用站起来
At ease, sports fans, don't get up.

229
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,960
我听说就快结案了
I hear congratulations are in order.

230
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,630
卧底买卖收获颇丰啊
That's quite the buy 'n bust.

231
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,170
几公斤的毒品
Kilos of poison

232
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,930
还有几个被逮捕的毒贩
and a handful of scumbag dealers off the streets

233
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,840
向我们出卖他们的朋友
and ratting on their friends for us.

234
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,390
这些都是小鱼 我们很快就会钓到大鱼的
These are the small fish. We'll catch the sharks soon enough.

235
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,520
你开始查这事的时候 我怎么跟你说的
What did I tell you when you started this thing?

236
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,850
“这个案子会是个怪物 所以关门放狗”
This case is gonna be a monster. Unleash the hounds.

237
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,440
看来你做到了
Seems you did.

238
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,860
说到怪物
Speaking of monsters,

239
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,820
霍滕斯四世怎么样了
how's Hortense the Fourth?

240
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,530
二十个月前 已经进入可怕的两岁期了
20 months, already into his terrible twos.

241
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,740
显然 他是个神童
Apparently, he's a prodigy.

242
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,620
各位 干得好
Good work, everyone. Good work.

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,660
说起神童
Talking about a prodigy,

244
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,330
你就要达到百加得151里程碑了
you're about to hit your Bacardi milestone.

245
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,920
已经侦破151起案件了
151 cases closed.

246
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,380
在案子完成前 不要加到统计表里
Don't add it to the stats sheets till it's done.

247
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,670
我们这一行的人会被派往海外
People in our profession

248
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,970
在那里 我们会被枪击 被轰炸 被简易爆炸装置炸飞
are sent overseas where we're shot at, bombed, blasted from IEDs.

249
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,010
然后这些混蛋会靠卖这玩意
Then these assholes make more money selling this shit

250
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,350
赚的比我们所有人的养老金总和都多
than all our pensions combined.

251
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,140
真不公平
It's fucked up.

252
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,730
我就说说而已
All I'm saying.

253
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,230
对了 48公斤值多少钱
How much is 48 bricks worth, anyway?

254
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,190
47
47.

255
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,860
少了一公斤 是47公斤 不是48公斤
one's missing. There's 47, not 48.

256
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,860
在调查中 细节很重要
In an investigation, details matter.

257
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,070
海洛因的数量是个细节
Brick of heroin's a hell of a detail.

258
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,080
那不可能 我在销售点数过 是48公斤
That's impossible. I counted 48 at point of sale.

259
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,410
要么是你数错了 要么就是有人递错了
Either you miscounted or they palmed one back to short you.

260
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,710
不会 只有新手才会犯这种错误
No, no, no. You do shit like that, you're not in the game for long.

261
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,920
我知道我们 往斯旺的车里装了48公斤
I know we loaded 48 bricks into Swan's ride.

262
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,130
我们查查你的车
Let's check your car.

263
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,060
什么都没有
Nothing.

264
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,410
谜团解开了
Mystery solved.

265
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,290
肯定是我开车的时候掉到后面卡住了
Must have fallen back there when I was driving and gotten stuck.

266
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,960
因为这个失误 我猜今晚第一轮该我请客
Guess the first round's on me tonight for that fuckup.

267
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,260
掉了一公斤的海洛因 我得说应该请两轮
Losing a key of H, I'd say that's worth two rounds.

268
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,770
什么
What?

269
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,230
没什么
Nothing.

270
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,240
其实我都忘记这件事了 但这不支持你的论点
I'd actually forgotten about that, but it doesn't support your argument.

271
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,790
斯旺可能本来偷了毒品 而他只是惊慌失措 并将其归还
Swan could have been stealing drugs and just panicked and gave them back.

272
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,410
也许他后悔错过了这个赚大钱的机会
Maybe he regretted letting a chance at big money go by.

273
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,960
也许小翅膀项目来了
Maybe something like Little Wing came along

274
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,000
他不能再次错过赚钱的机会
and he couldn't pass up that kind of opportunity again.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,340
有很多种可能 我的直觉告诉我他是个好人
That's a lot of maybes. My gut tells me he's a good man.

276
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,920
你的直觉以前从没出过错吗
Your gut's never been wrong before?

277
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,300
你知道我是怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

278
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,270
你希望斯旺是无辜的 因为是你招募他到110小组的
You want Swan to be innocent because you hired him into the 110th,

279
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,600
如果他参与此事 你会做一些蠢事
and if he's involved in something like this,

280
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,690
比如你会因为我们朋友的死而自责
you'd do something stupid like blame yourself for our friends' deaths.

281
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,940
而正如我所说 这样很蠢
Which, like I said, would be stupid.

282
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,110
我们看看奥唐纳发现了什么
Let's just see what O'Donnell found.

283
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,540
科罗拉多州丹佛

284
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,210
梅森先生 我是埃尔佐格比医生
- Mr. Mason? - Dr. Elzogby.

285
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,790
我看了你的病历 乍一看 我不得不说
So, I read your intake, and upon first glance, I got to say,

286
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,800
有几个问题
got a few questions.

287
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,800
我和所有人一样都喜欢钱 但你是个英俊的小伙子
Look, I like a payday as much as the next guy, but you're quite a handsome fella.

288
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,800
我不会告诉你该怎么过你的生活
Now, I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, but

289
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,970
但你真的想让我给你整个新面孔吗
are you really certain you want me to give you a new face?

290
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,350
从某种意义上来说
In a manner of speaking.

291
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,860
别挣扎
Don't struggle.

292
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,160
你是医生 你知道发生了什么
You're a doctor, you know what's happening.

293
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,700
你的气管被割破了
Your trachea is severed.

294
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,000
血液正在肺部 你快憋死了
Blood is entering your lungs, you're drowning,

295
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,920
你的大脑缺氧 神经系统停止工作
your brain is deprived of oxygen and your nervous system's shutting down.

296
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,000
所以现在你几乎看不到我
So, by now, you can barely see me

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
现在你还听不到我说话 而现在
and now you can't hear me and now...

298
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,930
你死了
...you're dead.

299
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,610
我要和你的秘书说句话
I'm just gonna go and have a word with your secretary.

300
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,080
曼努埃尔埃尔佐格比医生 整容手术

301
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,210
今天所有预约取消

302
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,720
汽车旅馆

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,430
丹尼尔博伊德 拉沃伊参议员的立法主任
Daniel Boyd, Senator Lavoy's legislative director.

304
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,350
被宠坏的蠢货 一辈子从没举起过
Spoiled dipshit who's never lifted anything heavier

305
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,220
任何比灰雁酒瓶更重的东西
than a Grey Goose bottle in his life.

306
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,180
以C+的成绩进入弗吉尼亚大学
C-plus student who got into UVA and Georgetown Law

307
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,980
和乔治敦法学院 这都多亏了他父母的关系
thanks to Mommy and Daddy's connections. Real party boy.

308
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,190
真正的派对男孩
Two dismissed DWIs in college.

309
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,270
大学期间两个被撤销的酒后驾车记录

310
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,030
法学院第二年 他被抓到嫖娼
Second year of law school, gets caught with a sex worker.

311
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,190
指控神秘消失
Charges mysteriously disappeared.

312
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,490
平均成绩2.3 直接进入私人律所
Took his 2.3 GPA straight into private practice.

313
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,200
而现在他负责起草 决定我们命运的法案
And now he drafts legislation that decides the fate of the free world,

314
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,040
让他的老板给符合最会讨好他的 游说者的利益的内容投票
telling his boss to vote on whatever benefits the lobbyists who wooed him best.

315
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,290
所以他含着金钥匙出生
So, he was born somewhere between third and home base

316
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,080
从没听说过“后果”这个词
and never heard the word "consequence."

317
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,670
你要用你那招 “比不道德差一点”的伎俩吗
You gonna pull a few moves from your sleazy-adjacent playbook?

318
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,300
我就是这么想的
That's the general idea.

319
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,880
博伊德今晚将在波士顿 参加通俗乐团的筹款活动
Boyd's gonna be in Boston tonight for a fundraiser event at the Pops.

320
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,340
我们可以设个局 轻易拿捏他
We'll set him up like a bowling pin.

321
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,930
- 怎么  - 你竟然接电话了
Yeah. You pick up the phone.

322
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,480
我还以为你开车闯进那栋办公楼时
I thought maybe you couldn't answer because you broke your hand

323
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,820
弄伤了手 所以没法接呢
when you drove the fucking car through the office building.

324
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,820
我根本没受伤
I didn't get hurt at all.

325
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,940
你觉得这很有趣吗
You think this is funny?

326
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,360
我跟你说了 “别再搞牛仔那套”
I told you no more cowboy shit.

327
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,700
那辆车属于他们的一名员工
The car belonged to one of their employees.

328
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,780
我是去还车的
I was returning it.

329
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,280
听我说 大聪明
Listen, wiseass, my boss

330
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,490
我的老大因为你们差点把我开除了
almost punched my ticket because of you.

331
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,120
也许那是件好事
Well, maybe that's a good thing

332
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,580
因为我小队的成员濒临死亡 而你什么都没做
'cause members of my unit are falling from the sky like raindrops and you haven't done shit.

333
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,130
嘿 我想知道 你们从新时代得到的所有线索
Hey, hey. I want everything you got on New Age.

334
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,420
- 明白吗  - 好的
- You understand? - Fine.

335
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,590
这就是我这次接电话的原因 我有理由跟你说话了
That's why I answered the phone this time. I actually have a reason to talk to you.

336
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,430
我会把他们的安保团队名单发给你
I'm gonna send you their security team roster.

337
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,930
查一下这些人有什么联系
Run background checks, see what connections these guys have.

338
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,510
等等 怎么 你觉得 我是来给你们做文书工作的
W... Wait, wait, wait. What do you think-- I'm here to do your clerical work?

339
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,430
是啊
Yup.

340
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,930
我们正忙着去波士顿
We're busy heading off to Boston.

341
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,270
波士顿有什么
What's in Boston?

342
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,350
交响乐
The symphony.

343
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,770
他妈的
Goddamn it.

344
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,070
但在我们去北边之前 迪克森和我应该去跟马洛伯恩斯谈谈
Before we head north, though, Dixon and I should go talk to Marlo Burns,

345
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,440
给她施点压
step on her neck a little bit.

346
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,650
网上有地址
Address is online.

347
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,030
- 这就是为何我不买房子 - 是啊 好借口
Right there is why I don't have a house. Yeah, that's the reason.

348
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,790
那么 我们干活的时候 你们要做什么
So, while we do all the work, what are you guys gonna do?

349
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,120
我们要去拿些毒品
Oh, we're gonna go score some drugs.

350
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,430
你们好啊
Howdy.

351
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,770
- 见鬼  - 警察
Oh, shit. Five-O! Five-O!

352
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,680
真没礼貌
Well, that's just rude.

353
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,360
你这周运气不好
This just ain't your week.

354
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,340
混蛋 找份新工作吧
Find a new line of work, asshole.

355
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,930
她有个孩子
She's got a kid.

356
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,320
室内安全
House clear.

357
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,110
已确认
Affirmative.

358
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,200
有什么有趣的发现吗
Anything interesting?

359
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,250
只有马洛留下的一些昂贵的珠宝
I mean, just some expensive jewelry Marlo left behind.

360
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,370
留下的
Left behind?

361
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,000
你觉得她跑了
Think she bugged out?

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,710
她从后门出去了 门都没锁
She exited out the back door without locking it,

363
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,260
衣服扔得到处都是 显然是匆忙打包的
clothes are all over, clearly packed in a hurry.

364
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,050
衣橱和橱柜是开着的
Closet and... cabinets are open.

365
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,230
她拿走了牙刷和牙膏
Well, she took her toothbrush and toothpaste.

366
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,530
绑匪通常不关心口腔卫生
Kidnappers don't care about oral hygiene.

367
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,410
简是个玩家
Jane's a gamer.

368
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,240
品味不错
Got good taste.

369
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,370
你可能想来看看这个
Uh, you might want to come and see this.

370
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,720
谁会逃跑的时候 不带上储备的现金啊
Who the hell goes on the lam and leaves their cash stash behind?

371
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,390
显然 马洛伯恩斯不会
Apparently, Marlo Burns.

372
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,140
确认一下 您预订了一辆凯迪拉克凯雷德
So, to confirm, you've reserved a Cadillac Escalade,

373
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,650
三天后返还到肯尼迪机场 对吗
to be returned within three days' time to JFK Airport.

374
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,600
科罗拉多州驾驶证 埃尔佐格比

375
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,730

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,320
为了答谢老顾客

谢谢惠顾 埃尔佐格比医生 祝您旅途愉快
Thank you for your business, Dr. Elzogby. Have a wonderful drive.

380
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
你想要这个吗
Would you like this?

381
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,930
你知道我为什么这么喜欢漫画书吗
Do you know why I love comic books so much?

382
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,430
马萨诸塞州波士顿

383
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,980
看看你
Well, look at you.

384
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,650
你不觉得现在更文明了吗 杜立特女士
Don't you feel more civilized now, Ms. Doolittle?

385
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,190
- 你之前穿的那身衣服在哪里  - 垃圾桶
Wait, where are the clothes you were wearing? Garbage.

386
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,320
垃圾桶 为什么
Garbage, why?

387
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,700
我已经提着靴子了
I'm already carrying boots.

388
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,080
如果我还有更多衣服的话 很快我就需要手提箱了
If I had any more clothes, pretty soon I'd need a suitcase.

389
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
要是我有了手提箱 我需要一个房子来存放它
I got a suitcase, I need a house to keep it in.

390
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,120
然后我还需要一辆车停在车道上
Then I need a car for the driveway.

391
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
很快 我就得填写各种表格
Before you know it, I'm filling out all kinds of forms.

392
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,460
所以 对你来说 一件备用衬衫太累赘了
So, a spare shirt's just too much of an attachment for you?

393
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,380
有人诊断说你是反社会人格吗
Anyone ever diagnose you as a sociopath?

394
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,470
诊断 没有
Diagnosed? No.

395
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,100
那么 你觉得马洛伯恩斯 为什么慌忙逃跑
So... what do you make of Marlo Burns taking off

396
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,060
只带了几件衣服 把所有现金都留下
with just some clothes and leaving all that cash behind?

397
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,600
我还不确定
Not sure yet.

398
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,310
她确实拿走了牙刷
Well, she did take her toothbrush.

399
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,230
她应该是你的灵魂伴侣吧
She could be your soul mate.

400
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,320
闭嘴
Shut up.

401
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,450
一个字都别说
Not one word.

402
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,990
- 天啊 - 那是两个字了
Holy shit. That's two words.

403
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,040
再说一个字 我就把这个小高跟插进你屁眼里
Another one, and I'll shove this kitten heel right up your ass.

404
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,370
我只是说你很漂亮 你们俩都看起来不错
I'm just saying you look nice. You both look nice.

405
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,290
我们看起来就像婚礼蛋糕上的混蛋
We look like the assholes on top of a wedding cake.

406
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,550
给 等我的养老金到账 我会在一个月内还给你的
Here, I'll pay you back in a month when my pension lands.

407
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,090
你的养老金可买不起那套西服
Yeah, your pension won't cover that suit.

408
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,630
也付不起酒店房间 机票也付不起
Or the hotel room. Or the plane ticket.

409
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,220
我会在两个月内还清
I'll pay you back in two months.

410
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,390
好的
Okay.

411
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,140
大家都准备好了吗
Everyone ready?

412
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,480
我们去听无聊的音乐吧
Let's go listen to some boring-ass music.

413
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,020
好的
Okay.

414
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,400
闭上嘴巴 老大 你的嘴巴大得都快进苍蝇了
And, uh, close your mouth, boss. You're catching flies.

415
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,130
借过
Excuse me.

416
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,470
谢谢 对不起
Thank you. Pardon me.

417
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,390
- 借过 - 没事
- Excuse me. - Of course. Okay.

418
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,560
不对 这...
Oh, no, it's...

419
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,100
- 抱歉 - 没事
Apologies. Not at all.

420
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,650
对不起 我有点晕头转向的 我不知道我的座位
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm a little turned around. I don't know if I have

421
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,770
是在乐队席还是在楼层包厢
orchestra seats or floor box seats,

422
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,030
我其实都不知道这是什么意思
and I actually don't even know what that means.

423
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,820
- 介意吗  - 我们看看票上写的什么
- Okay, well... - Do you mind? Let's just see what we got here.

424
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,240
- 夹层楼 那是你的位置... - 好的
Hmm, the mezzanine, that's where you are, but... Okay.

425
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,830
...但那座位可不怎么样 你会想坐在这里
that just simply won't cut it. You see, you want to be down here.

426
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,370
声音就像羊毛一样包围着你
The sound, it just wraps around you like a fleece.

427
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,750
等我的助手来了 你跟他换个位置吧
How about I swap your ticket with my aide when he arrives?

428
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,670
他不介意吗
Wouldn't he mind?

429
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,670
他要是想保住工作 就不会介意
Well, not if he wants to keep his job.

430
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,800
请坐吧
Please, take a seat.

431
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,710
谢谢
Thank you.

432
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,850
稳操胜券
In the bag.

433
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,100
我们有13/14 8/13
We go 13/14s. 8/13s.

434
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,190
总共七个月 每周工作六天
Over seven months, six-day working weeks.

435
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,400
也许是一个记录时间的时间表  也许是一种评级标准 我不知道
Maybe a time sheet clocking hours? Maybe a ratings scale? I don't know.

436
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,860
需要加水吗
Top you off?

437
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,280
- 需要 - 需要 女士
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

438
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,740
还有 请把账单拿给我 好吗  这家伙没钱
And when you get the chance, could you bring me the bill? This guy doesn't have any money.

439
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,780
当然可以 让我帮你统计一下
Sure. Let me tally it up for you.

440
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,580
太棒了
Great.

441
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,620
这是统计
It's a tally.

442
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,700
什么
What?

443
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,660
这里
Here.

444
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,170
13/14
13/14ths.

445
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,380
某件事发生了13次 但本来应该发生14次
Something happened 13 times when it was supposed to happen 14 times.

446
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,800
这里 11次的13次 8次的11次
Uh, here, 11 out of 13. Eight out of 11.

447
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,470
嘿 伙计 我只是...
Hey, bud, I just...

448
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,800
好的 我怎么跟你说的
Okay, what did I tell you?

449
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,850
手是用来帮忙的 不是用来打人的
Hands are for helping, not hitting.

450
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,520
向你的兄弟道歉 把你的乐高给他玩 好吗
Apologize to your brother. Share your Legos, okay?

451
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
我爱你
I love you.

452
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,060
我对你的爱可以往返月球
To the moon and back.

453
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,980
好的 再见了
Okay, bye for now.

454
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,570
对不起 我不知道 我为什么要给他们我的一次性手机号
Sorry, I don't know why I gave them my burner number, uh...

455
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,570
你看起来很开心
Well, you look happy.

456
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,450
我算了一下
I did the math.

457
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,290
有2197个事件 不管具体是什么事
There were 2,197 total events, whatever they were.

458
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,540
但只成功了1547次 但这个数字并不有趣
But they only succeeded 1,547 times. But that's not the interesting number.

459
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,290
看看他们有多少次 没得到他们想要的结果
Look how many times they didn't get the outcome they wanted.

460
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,460
2197减去1547
2,197 minus 1,547.

461
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,010
650天啊
Six hundred and fifty. Holy shit.

462
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,970
六千五 每手十万
Six fifty at 100K each.

463
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,550
这一切都以某种方式联系在一起
It's all connected somehow.

464
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,600
那么...
So...

465
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,480
那么 “手是用来帮忙的”
So... hands are for helping?

466
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,610
你口袋里还装着铜指虎
You have brass knuckles in your pocket.

467
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,070
我有《狗狗巡逻队》的创可贴 还有操场的沙子
I got a PAW Patrol Band-Aid and some playground sand, too.

468
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,240
听着 我不在的时候 他们不停地打电话 我...
Look, they call nonstop when I'm not there.

469
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,820
我在家的时候
And when I am there, it's, you know,

470
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,370
要早上7点去周末足球比赛
7:00 a.m. weekend soccer games,

471
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,740
参加教师会议
teacher conferences,

472
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,870
与妻子预订的做爱
scheduled sex with the wife.

473
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,460
我不再孑然一身
I am no longer my own man.

474
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,670
你不会拿它换世界上任何东西
And you wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

475
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,210
六千五百万美元都不行
Not for $65 million.

476
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,340
你彻底变了 奥唐纳
You are a changed man, O'Donnell.

477
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,510
是啊 也许你应该试试
Yep. Maybe you should give it a go, huh?

478
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,760
买些土地 组建个家庭
Buy some land, start a family.

479
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,770
你会是亲师会上最可怕的人 但你会是个好爸爸
You'd be the scariest guy at PTA, but you'd be a good dad.

480
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,270
- 要是我有土地 我会有四... - 四五条狗
- If I had land, I'd get four or five... - Four or five dogs.

481
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,520
你会有四五条狗 没有女人
You'd get four or five dogs, no woman?

482
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,650
连迪克森都不要
Not even Dixon?

483
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,570
她是朋友
She's a friend.

484
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,410
好吧
Okay.

485
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,160
随你怎么说吧 就像是一件衣服
Whatever you say. That was some dress, though.

486
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,660
是一件很好的衣服
Hell of a dress.

487
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,130
是内格利的消息 现在是中场休息
From Neagley. It's intermission.

488
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,710
迪克森和博伊德现在要走了
Dixon and Boyd are leaving now.

489
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
他们在那里
There they are.

490
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,430
真是一件很好的衣服啊
That's one hell of a dress.

491
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,600
我的车在拐角处 那样可以吗
My car's around the corner. Does that work?

492
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,060
我会跟着你走 美女
I'll follow anywhere you lead, gorgeous.

493
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,730
- 我们去派对吧 - 好的
- Well, let's go party. - Okay.

494
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,690
看看她
Look at her.

495
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,350
博伊德没机会
Boyd didn't stand a chance.

496
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,610
又是内格利 她说我的人就位了
Neagley again. She says my guy's in place.

497
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,700
嘿 你的这位朋友会帮我们 对吧
Hey, this friend of yours. He's gonna come through for us, yeah?

498
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:27,120
如果他在军队的话 我会邀请他加入110小组
If he was in the Army, I'd have asked him to join the 110th.

499
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,000
过来
Come here.

500
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
你都兴奋了
Oh, you're all riled up.

501
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,090
我能说什么 古典音乐让我兴奋
Well, what can I say? Classical music gets my motor running.

502
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,630
慢一点 极速赛车手 我们先来点前戏
Yeah, well, drop it to second, Speed Racer. Let's have a little primer first.

503
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,720
你不是在胡闹 好吧
You're not messing around. All right.

拿着
Okay, hold this. Hold... hold that.

506
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,060
我一直不知道要弄多厚或者多薄...
I never know how thick or thin to make these things.

507
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,310
嘿 我来吧
Hey, allow me.

508
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,690
谢谢
Thank you.

509
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,910
好了 女士优先
Okay. Ladies first?

510
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,870
不 你弄的 你应该得到奖励
Oh, no, you did the work, you get the reward.

511
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,990
恭敬不如从命
If you insist.

512
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,170
糟了 努力保持冷静
Shit. Shit. Just-just play it cool, just play it cool. Just play it cool.

513
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,090
先生 你得把毒品收起来 然后下车
Sir, you're gonna want to put the drugs away and step out of the car.

514
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,060
那不是我的毒品
They're not my drugs.

515
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,270
哪些毒品
Which drugs--

516
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,770
你化妆镜里的 还是你鼻子上的
the ones on your mirror or up your nose?

517
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,610
你觉得化妆镜是我的吗  全都是她的
You think I own a makeup mirror? They're all hers.

518
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,150
跟她说的不一样 而且她又没拿化妆镜
Not what she's saying, and she wasn't holding it.

519
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,070
她已经提出进行血检和尿检
And she already offered up blood and urine.

520
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,820
你想进行血检和尿检吗
Do you want to offer up blood and urine?

521
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,910
听我说 长官
Listen, Officer,

522
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,740
我不愿意这么说 但你知道我是谁吗
I hate putting it this way, but... do you know who I am?

523
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,950
我其实知道 博伊德先生
I do, actually, Mr. Boyd.

524
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,960
我还知道车里的那个女人 不是博伊德太太
And I know that woman in the car wasn't Mrs. Boyd.

525
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,250
我特别讨厌那些
And I have a special distaste for people

526
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,510
不珍惜神圣的婚姻的人
who don't appreciate the sanctity of marriage.

527
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,340
我也知道你是拉沃伊参议员的手下
I also know you work for Senator Lavoy.

528
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,390
但我在系统里查你的名字时
But when I ran your name in the system,

529
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,970
触发了当地联邦调查局的警报
it set off bells and whistles at the local FBI office.

530
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,310
他们派了几个人过来跟你聊聊
They sent a couple of their boys down here just to talk to you.

531
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,150
他们似乎并不在乎你的老板是谁
And it seems they don't care who your boss is.

532
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,950
我是杰克马格雷福特工
Special Agent Jack Margrave.

533
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,370
这是布雷克特工
This is Special Agent Blake.

534
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,160
我是奥斯卡芬雷中尉
Lieutenant Oscar Finlay.

535
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,910
律师不在场 我不会说话
Yeah, I'm not talking without my lawyer.

536
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,370
你想请律师吗
You want to lawyer up?

537
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,420
好的 给他打电话吧
Fine. Call them.

538
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,210
我会的 他们一小时内 就会把我弄出去
I will. And they'll have me out of here within the hour.

539
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,300
你知道
You know...

540
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,680
那就太晚了
...that's just gonna be too late.

541
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,840
因为等他们到这里时
Because by the time they get here,

542
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,760
我们就已经 在《环球报》和《先驱报》的头版
we'll already have the story of a senator's legislative director

543
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,140
刊登了一位参议员的立法主任
in the wrong woman's car with a snout full of booger sugar

544
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,600
坐在错误的女人的车里 鼻子里全是可卡因的报道
on the front page of the Globe and the Herald.

545
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,610
你知道
You see,

546
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,360
这不是大学或法学院 孩子
this is not college or law school, son.

547
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,070
你也不是被宠坏的 勉强拿到C+的富家子弟
You're not some spoiled rich kid barely rocking a C-plus.

548
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,490
你现在是个政客
You're a Beltway man now.

549
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,910
是人们喜欢搞垮的那种人
Kind of guy that people enjoy knocking down a peg or two.

550
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,950
所以这些指控
So these charges,

551
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,580
它们可不会逃过大众的法眼
they're not just gonna get swept under the rug.

552
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,000
我们不会让他们这样
We're not gonna let 'em.

553
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,130
想知道原因吗
Want to know why?

554
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,670
好吧 为什么
Okay. Why?

555
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,960
因为我们不喜欢你
'Cause we don't like you.

556
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,720
我甚至都不知道你们为什么来这里
I don't even know why you're here.

557
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,010
我们在这里是因为 我们想知道关于小翅膀计划的
We're here 'cause we want to know everything there is to know

558
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,930
所有信息
about Little Wing.

559
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,810
- 我也许应该... - 你应该
- I should probably... - Yeah, you should.

560
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,150
是啊 我要给 博伊德先生的妻子打电话
Yeah. I'm gonna call Mr. Boyd's wife.

561
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,690
她可能在华盛顿担心他
Eh, she's probably worried about him over in D.C.

562
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,690
非常担心
Worried sick.

563
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,530
老婆开心 生活舒心
You know, happy wife, happy life, huh?

564
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,110
好吧
Okay. Fine.

565
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,820
- 你好  - 我打错了
- Hello? - Wrong number.

566
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,870
说话
Talk.

567
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,200
这没什么大不了的
It's not that big of a deal.

568
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,830
小翅膀只是个代号
Little Wing is just a code name.

569
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,830
什么的代号
For what?

570
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,750
一项目前正在开发的新技术的代号
For a new technology currently in development.

571
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,880
一个令人难以置信的反导弹软件
Some incredible anti-missile software

572
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,460
它最初是为保护商用飞机而开发的
originally developed to protect commercial aircraft,

573
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,380
但某个航空公司找到了我们
but a certain aeronautics company approached us.

574
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,840
让我猜猜
Let me guess--

575
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,180
新时代
New Age?

576
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,890
是的 新时代
That's right. New Age.

577
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,930
他们发现该软件可以做些调整
They found the software could be tweaked.

578
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,600
它可以用于导弹中 而且不仅仅是针对它们
It could be used in missiles and not just against them.

579
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,600
它还可以缩小
It could be scaled down and installed

580
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,360
安装在便携式肩扛式地对空武器中
in portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air weaponry.

581
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,440
这个软件能让导弹击破
The software allows missiles

582
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,940
- 所有已知的对抗措施 - 怎么做到的
to defeat all known countermeasures. How?

583
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,110
那是穿着实验室制服的 书呆子才会问的问题
That's a question for a nerd in a lab coat, man.

584
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,780
好吧 我只知道
Okay? All I know is

585
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,870
从地面发射的导弹 能完全绕过它们的目标
that missiles shot from the ground completely bypass their target,

586
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,540
让飞行员相信威胁已经过去
making pilots believe the threat has passed,

587
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,920
然后它们重新校准 转身
and then they recalibrate, turn around,

588
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,290
重新瞄准飞机 重新进行攻击
zero back in on the aircraft and reattack.

589
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,170
这必死无疑 无法避免
It's death from above and there is no way to avoid it.

590
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,720
你开火 就能射中目标 就是这样
You fire, you hit your target. Period.

591
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,640
那拉沃伊参议员参与了什么
And what's Senator Lavoy's involvement?

592
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,810
项目需要一个拨款法案 好吗
Well, the project required an appropriation bill, all right?

593
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,140
你想要通过一个法案
You want to get one passed?

594
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,520
就得面对多年的繁文缛节
You're looking at years of bureaucratic bullshit

595
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,230
这都要归功于一些 关于修改民用技术的古怪法律
all thanks to some arcane laws on modifying civilian tech.

596
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,900
但拉沃伊知道小翅膀 会带领我们的军队走向未来
But Lavoy knew Little Wing would slingshot our military into the future,

597
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,200
所以如果我们袖手旁观
so if we just sat on our hands,

598
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,700
等待申请通过正规渠道
waiting for it to go through the proper channels,

599
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,990
那永远都无法落实
it would never happen.

600
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,540
所以我猜拉沃伊没有以最体面的方式
So I'm assuming Lavoy didn't clear up the red tape

601
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,620
清除繁文缛节
in the most reputable manner?

602
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,670
我帮忙把提案塞进了 一份一千页的法规中
I helped bury the proposal in a thousand-page statute

603
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,170
与此同时 拉沃伊负责握手拉选票
while Lavoy shook hands and drummed up votes.

604
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,840
甚至都没人知道法案里有这个
No one even knew it was in there.

605
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,130
他纯粹是好心做这事
And he did this out of the goodness of his heart?

606
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,510
为了保护民主
To protect democracy?

607
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,520
没有收红包之类的
No fat envelopes slipped inside newspapers on park benches?

608
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,270
成熟点 好吗
Grow the fuck up, okay?

609
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,230
这是华盛顿特区 这是办事的规矩
It's D.C. It's how shit gets done.

610
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,900
此外 拉沃伊知道小翅膀会拯救生命
Besides, Lavoy knew Little Wing would save lives.

611
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,230
我的意思是
I mean...

612
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,150
每个人都嘲笑星球大战的防御计划
everyone made fun of the Star Wars defense program,

613
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,700
但看看我们现在的处境
but, hey, look at where we are now.

614
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,660
每个人都想从空中发射炮弹
Everyone's trying to shoot projectiles out of the air.

615
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,160
小翅膀可以击中空中的任何物体
Little Wing can knock anything out of the sky.

616
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,460
任何物体
Anything?

617
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,090
比如商用飞机
Like commercial aircraft?

618
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,840
你开火 就能击中目标
You fire, you hit the target. You said so yourself.

619
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,670
- 你自己说的 - 对 但这是我们的技术 归我们所有
Yeah, but it's our tech. We have it.

620
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,590
其他人都无法得到它
Nobody else can get their hands on it.

621
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,890
你们想的那种事是不会发生的
Nothing like you're thinking is going to happen.

622
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,520
新时代非常安全 他们的两个场所都采用了
New Age is incredibly secure. Both of their facilities

623
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,930
- 最先进的... - 两个场所
- implement state-of-the-art... - Both facilities?

624
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,310
什么意思
What do you mean?

625
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,850
新时代有两个基地
New Age has two bases.

626
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,060
软件是在纽约开发的
Software made in New York,

627
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,650
硬件是在丹佛的制造工厂制造的
hardware at a manufacturing plant in Denver.

628
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,780
还有什么
What else can you tell us?

629
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,360
没了 我发誓我就知道这些
Nothing. That's all I know. I swear.

630
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,620
嘿 拉沃伊和我 我们走了捷径
Hey, Lavoy and me-- we-we cut some corners,

631
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,990
我们确实做了一些不该做的事
we did some stuff we should not have done,

632
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,370
但这都是为了让国防法案通过
but it was all to get a defense bill passed,

633
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,710
保护国家
protect the country.

634
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,250
那结果如何
How'd that work out?

635
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,840
嘿 抱歉 所以毒品指控会被撤销吗
Hey, excuse me. So, are the drug charges getting dropped or what?

636
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,300
我不知道 我不是警察
I don't know. I'm not a cop.

637
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,690
真意外 居然接到你的电话
Heck of a surprise getting a call from you.

638
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,650
听说你又戴上警徽了 真是太意外了
Hell of a surprise hearing you're wearing the badge again.

639
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,980
中尉 彼此彼此
Lieutenant, no less.

640
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,110
是啊 退休可不适合我
Yeah, well, retirement didn't suit me.

641
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,570
说起来 我看你还穿着呢子大衣
Speaking of suits, see you're still sporting the tweed.

642
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,570
一如既往的可靠 芬雷
Reliable as ever, Finlay.

643
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,620
你是说你自己吧
Speak for yourself.

644
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,120
我们初次见面时 你跟我说了什么
What was it you told me when we first met--

645
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
“麻烦似乎总是找上你”
trouble always seems to find you?

646
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,630
你杀了很多人吗
You kill a whole lot of people?

647
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,880
- 时不时 - 需要帮忙吗
Here and there. You need my help?

648
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
你已经帮我了
Already gave it.

649
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,720
你还在转那枚结婚戒指吗
You still spinning that wedding ring?

650
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,970
时不时 但感觉一天比一天好
Here and there. But feeling better every day.

651
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,390
- 狗呢  - 杰克很能吃
- And the dog? - Jack eats too much.

652
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,640
狗如其名
Just like his namesake.

653
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,110
今天 老大 汽车正在行驶 如果我不尽快脱掉这件紧身衣
Today, boss. Car's running, and if I don't get out of this straitjacket soon,

654
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,860
- 事情会变得很难看的 - 内格利
things are gonna get ugly. Neagley?

655
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,820
我都没认出你 看起来很美
Didn't recognize you. Looking good.

656
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,030
别多管闲事 补丁男
Mind your business, elbow patches.

657
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,280
你听到这位女士说的了
Hey, you heard the lady.

658
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,490

If I don't have her in jeans in 20 minutes,

659

我就完蛋了
I'm done for.

660
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,330

你和迪克森去丹佛

小翅膀软件需要导弹硬件
The Little Wing software is useless without the missile hardware,

666
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,060
那是硬件的制造地
and that's where it's made.

667
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,690
也许你们可以干扰一下 以免导弹落入坏人之手
Maybe you can gum up the works, keep the missiles out of the wrong hands.

Want to swing by Homeland, see what they know about A.M.

If taking out airplanes is his M.O., they might have some intel on him.

671
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,490
我们要怎么做
How do you figure we're gonna do that?

672
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,080
你觉得我们就直接敲门说 “国防部能出来玩吗 ”
You think we're just gonna knock on the door and say, "Can the DoD come out and play?"

673
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,000
我兄弟在国土安全局工作
My brother worked for Homeland.

He's dead.

我有权用浴室 我得换衣服
Dibs on the bathroom. I need to get changed.

680
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,500
是吗 你要把这衣服扔进垃圾桶 就像这位反社会朋友一样吗
Yeah? You gonna throw it in the garbage like our sociopathic friend here?

681
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,790
不会 怎么 你想借
Oh, why, you want to borrow it?

682

684

但交出你们的枪
but hand over your guns.

685
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,730
你为什么觉得我们有枪
What makes you think we have guns?

686
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,940
有人跟我们说你们有枪 雷彻
We were told you'd be packing, Reacher.

687
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,740
他们还跟你说 今晚你会死吗
They also tell you you'd die tonight?

688
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,410
我会死 真搞笑
I'll die? That's funny.

689
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,830
没有枪 所以没有噪音
No guns, so no noise.

690
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,330
他们说你们很聪明
They said you were smart.

691
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,000
我要砍死你

694

Everyone okay?

695

696
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,930
不能更好了
Never better.

697
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,100
我的鞋坏了
Fucked up my shoes,

698
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,310
但我没事
but I'm fine.

699
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,950

700
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,820
不用你问出口 已经完事了
Before you ask if it's done, it is,

701
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,370
只是跟你希望的方式不同
just not in the way you hoped for.

702

你造成了很多复杂的问题

安保部老大
Head of security?

706
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,170
整件事的老大
Head of this whole thing?

707
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,800
也许我们一直在用 错误的方式处理此事 雷彻先生
Maybe we've been approaching this the wrong way, Mr. Reacher.

708
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,300

Just Reacher.
