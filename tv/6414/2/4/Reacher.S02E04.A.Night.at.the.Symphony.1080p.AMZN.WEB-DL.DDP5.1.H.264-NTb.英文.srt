1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,630
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,670
He said 650 at 100K each.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,300
It could be a transfer of 65 million, a $65 million cover-up,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,890
a $65 million bribe.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,930
We got a suspect.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,050
Azhari Mahmoud.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,770
He's known to Interpol as a weapons broker for terrorist organizations.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,640
He's a ghost. No pictures of him anywhere.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,020
If these are supposed to be fractions, then it's sloppy work.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,610
On each sheet there's 26 or 27 numerical tabulations.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,740
So, the real question is what kind of somethings were they counting?

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,950
You don't have to be lonely tonight.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,660
There were hit men who tried to kill us in Atlantic City.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,370
They failed, but they had a parking pass for a company called New Age.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,830
New Age is an aerospace company.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,130
I'm Marlo Burns, New Age Director of Operations.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,460
The parking pass was issued to a man named Trevor Saropian.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,630
- Where's his car? - We decided to take it with us.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,010
Holy shit. It's Swan.

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,310
He was working at New Age

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,390
with the people who've been trying to kill us.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,940
Great. Well, we drove a car through a window

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,940
so that I could read workers comp pleadings

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,030
for a secretary who slipped on New Age stairs five years ago.

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,780
So glad we risked prison for that.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,990
Yeah, I got nothing, too. No new information.

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,500
Well, I wouldn't say we haven't found any new information.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,880
I mean, we've got three special investigators dead,

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,790
one in the wind,

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,420
and the one who's missing just happens to be the one who worked for New Age.

31
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,180
What? Look, someone's got to say it.

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,760
Was Swan working with these guys or with these guys?

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,600
Swan's not dirty.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,020
- Look, man, we all want to believe that he isn't... - I know Swan. We all do.

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,150
And you don't think there's even a chance...

36
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,030
No. I don't.

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,780
Focus on what we found.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
Brad?

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,500
Stacy?

40
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,960
This is a brad.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,380
That is a fastener. Two names for something that size is stupid.

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,050
So is this conversation.

43
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,550
Well, speaking of names,

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,100
just found our man in the employee directory.

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,520
Seems Swan's title was assistant director of security.

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,060
Shane Langston, director of security.

47
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,400
Maybe he's the guy I got on the phone in Atlantic City.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,480
Why would you say that?

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,400
He's the security boss and bosses give orders

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,610
and the guys we killed had orders to take us out.

51
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,700
Just a theory. He could be the guy that got Swan caught up in all this.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,080
Well, if Swan didn't pull him into it first...

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,710
I already told you... Aren't you the guy that said that assumptions kill?

54
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,830
Well, you're assuming that Swan's the same guy he was back in the 110.

55
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,050
Hey, this is the guy Reacher chased down outside of Saropian's house.

56
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,260
Same photo as his ID badge.

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,720
Associate security officer.

58
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,850
Well, that's great.

59
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,970
Swan, Collins,

60
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,890
that's two New Age security personnel somehow involved in this.

61
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,230
Now we got to look into all these fuckers. Don't forget Marlo Burns.

62
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,610
She knew she was sending us right into a buzzsaw when she gave us Saropian's address.

63
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,480
So, the entire company's suspect.

64
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,190
We got over a thousand employees. How we gonna tackle that?

65
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,370
One at a time.

66
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,010
Last night you asked for a late night warrant for some defense firm,

67
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,310
and an hour later, the place is hit with a smash-and-grab.

68
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,930
Okay, do you know how that makes this department look?

69
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,940
Like we're five steps behind everything.

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,690
I made those applications when I had enough for a warrant.

71
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,030
And while you were waiting for them, all the evidence that you would have collected

72
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,990
from that place is all cleaned out.

73
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,700
And I'll bet you that it is those tin soldiers

74
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,780
that you were supposed to be keeping your black eye on.

75
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,540
It wasn't the army brats. I made it crystal clear to them

76
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,460
not to color outside the lines. Oh, I see.

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,000
You thought, if you told them nicely, they'd play along?

78
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,920
You're NYPD.

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,420
These are fucking PIs, for Chrissakes.

80
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,090
Is this too fucking much for you, Russo?

81
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,720
Lieutenant, lower your voice.

82
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,550
Lower my voice?

83
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,850
You're telling me to lower my voice in my own fucking office?

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,770
Okay.

85
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,850
Would you please go and find out what they learned, all right?

86
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,480
Am I asking you nicely enough, Russo?

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,190
I'll get it handled. Great.

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Close the door.

89
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,870
Who put this song on?

90
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,420
This is the Talking Heads.

91
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,290
You got beef with the Talking Heads? We're in New York.

92
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,540
They're a New York band.

93
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,460
They're a Rhode Island band that moved to New York

94
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,970
and no, I don't have a beef with them. It's just...

95
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,510
"Road to Nowhere," when we're sitting here getting nowhere,

96
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,970
seems a little defeatist.

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,520
Besides, it's not even their best song.

98
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,020
Probably prefer "Psycho Killer."

99
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,480
Um, I might have something.

100
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,940
I've been scrubbing the drives for everything Swan-related.

101
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
- And? - And I found an anomaly.

102
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,030
He's the assistant director of security,

103
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,660
so all of his emails have Langston-- his boss--

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,280
and a half-dozen other security personnel cc'd on them.

105
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,660
Makes sense. I mean, they're a team. They share information.

106
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,540
But he didn't share everything.

107
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,210
There are multiple emails between Swan and our old friend Marlo Burns.

108
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,040
Just them. No one else copied.

109
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,960
About what?

110
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,760
Music, but not really.

111
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,170
How do you know?

112
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,670
He wrote,

113
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,010
"I was listening to an album the other day,

114
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,310
thought you might like it. Jimi Hendrix, Bold as Love.

115
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,480
The sixth song is amazing. Take a listen, tell me what you think."

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Swan hated Hendrix. Anything with hard guitar.

117
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,900
No Skynyrd, no Hendrix, no Zeppelin, no Who.

118
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,490
I mean, that was his rule. He's leaving everyone else off the email

119
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,110
and saying he loved something we know he hated.

120
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,110
Could be code.

121
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,580
Or it could be a guy trying to get laid.

122
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,500
I mean, I once told a girl I loved Georgia O'Keeffe.

123
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,580
We say things.

124
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,170
Yeah. It says the sixth track is called "Little Wing."

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,340
Hold on.

126
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,680
I ever tell you you're smart, Neagley? Not nearly enough.

127
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,930
Right here. A file on a federal defense project called Little Wing,

128
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,520
by far the biggest contract New Age has ever had.

129
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,020
Four times the size of anything I've seen anywhere else in their records.

130
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,520
A nine-figure contract.

131
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,110
People have murdered for less.

132
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,150
Look at this interoffice memo.

133
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,450
Seems a test for the Little Wing tech was held for some military brass,

134
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,570
even a senator.

135
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,450
But what kind of test? And where?

136
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,410
Doesn't say,

137
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,620
but they do note that Senator Malcolm Lavoy

138
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,170
assured he would do all he could to get the congressional votes to make Little Wing a reality.

139
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,250
And I quote,

140
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,710
"He fully believes in the work we're doing here at New Age

141
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,550
and will do whatever it takes to help us."

142
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,590
Lavoy would fully believe in Snuffleupagus you pay him enough.

143
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,880
You know this guy?

144
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,100
By reputation. In D.C., Lavoy's what's known as a paper bag.

145
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,470
His politics and his vote go whichever way the wind's blowing.

146
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,270
He's known to do some shady shit.

147
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,520
So, if New Age stands to make a fortune on

148
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,820
a government contract and Lavoy is his champion in Congress,

149
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,530
it stands to reason New Age is the wind blowing Lavoy's bag.

150
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,940
That sounds wrong.

151
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,410
So, Swan, who's missing, maybe dirty, maybe not,

152
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,080
is code-texting Marlo Burns, who tried to have us killed

153
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
about a program supported

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,960
by an ethically-compromised politician.

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,420
We need talk to Malcolm Lavoy.

156
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,500
We'll never get close enough to a senator to find out what he may or may not know.

157
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,970
Oh, we don't need to. Those guys never even know what they're voting for.

158
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,930
Thousand-page bills, the legislative record, they don't read that stuff.

159
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,430
They just vote the way they're told to. But his legislative director--

160
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,520
they're the guys who actually craft and draft the laws,

161
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,480
which is good for us because those guys have no security detail.

162
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,190
Okay, but why would those people talk to us?

163
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,820
I can make it so they'll be begging to tell us what they know.

164
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,820
Something you want to share with the class?

165
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,370
Look, there's a lot of powerful people in D.C. with, uh...

166
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,120
confidential problems.

167
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,880
Mainly unsavory, but legal, things they do

168
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,170
in private that they'd rather not get made public.

169
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,130
My job is to make sure that their personal business stays personal.

170
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,050
And the people who know secrets, they keep those secrets.

171
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,050
So, you blackmail?

172
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,510
I incentivize.

173
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,140
Sounds sleazy, O'D.

174
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,970
It's sleazy-adjacent.

175
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,980
Hey, I got private school tuition to pay for, okay?

176
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,230
I never break the law.

177
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,690
I simply present the facts to people and let them know

178
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,900
which way the river's gonna flow if they choose the wrong course of action.

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
You give me ten minutes to make some phone calls,

180
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,990
I'll get the name of the legislative director and an Achilles' heel.

181
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,620
Do it.

182
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,080
All right.

183
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,170
Thank you.

184
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,260
Reacher, I know you don't want to talk about Swan...

185
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,970
Swan's clean. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have disappeared like the rest of the guys.

186
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,390
But he didn't disappear like the rest of the guys.

187
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,680
His body was never found His place wasn't trashed.

188
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,270
He wouldn't just leave his dog to die. Not who Swan was.

189
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,230
Maybe.

190
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,480
Or maybe he ran off so fast

191
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,610
because he knew three pissed-off soldiers and a kaiju were coming for him.

192
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,780
Dog was collateral damage.

193
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,160
Okay, look, we don't know what Swan's been up to since the 110th ended. Right?

194
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
I mean, he could have money problems. He could have been taking payoffs.

195
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Would you believe it if somebody told you I was taking payoffs?

196
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,170
No.

197
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm just saying

198
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,670
maybe we don't know some people as well as we think we do.

199
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,760
There's no way the Tony Swan I recruited is a part of this.

200
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,380
End of story.

201
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,690
See the look on their faces when we whipped out our badges?

202
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,980
They looked like Ralph Terry

203
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,530
when Bill Mazeroski hit his game seven walk-off homer on him.

204
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,570
Mazeroski? New rule, kid,

205
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,660
you can't reference

206
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,700
shit from more than a decade before you were born.

207
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,030
Go, Bucs.

208
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,200
We're so close to wrapping up this case I can taste it.

209
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,040
What do you think they're gonna give us-- Commendations, promotions?

210
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,500
I like the sound of that.

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,790
Pump the brakes, Major.

212
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,920
There's still a hell of a lot of work ahead.

213
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,460
More arrests to be made. Infrastructure to dismantle.

214
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,590
Whole networks of cargo planes, jeeps and helicopters across three continents.

215
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,550
Just take the W, Gramps.

216
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,850
Don't sass your elders.

217
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,390
Yeah. Take it easy on him, guys. He hasn't had his nap yet.

218
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,060
Damn. Looks like we got some Ivory Soap over here, Reacher.

219
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,980
Meaning?

220
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,480
Meaning this shit's so pure it floats.

221
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
How pure?

222
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,570
Ninety-nine percent.

223
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,740
No wonder kids are getting hooked on this shit left and right.

224
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,450
At ease, sports fans, don't get up.

225
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,960
I hear congratulations are in order.

226
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,630
That's quite the buy 'n bust.

227
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,170
Kilos of poison

228
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,930
and a handful of scumbag dealers off the streets

229
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,840
and ratting on their friends for us.

230
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,390
These are the small fish. We'll catch the sharks soon enough.

231
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,520
What did I tell you when you started this thing?

232
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,850
This case is gonna be a monster. Unleash the hounds.

233
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,440
Seems you did.

234
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,860
Speaking of monsters,

235
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,820
how's Hortense the Fourth?

236
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,530
20 months, already into his terrible twos.

237
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,740
Apparently, he's a prodigy.

238
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,620
Good work, everyone. Good work.

239
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,660
Talking about a prodigy,

240
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,330
you're about to hit your Bacardi milestone.

241
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,920
151 cases closed.

242
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,380
Don't add it to the stats sheets till it's done.

243
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,670
People in our profession re sent overseas

244
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,970
awhere we're shot at, bombed, blasted from IEDs.

245
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,010
Then these assholes make more money selling

246
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,350
this shit than all our pensions combined.

247
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,140
It's fucked up.

248
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,730
All I'm saying.

249
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,230
How much is 48 bricks worth, anyway?

250
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,190
47.

251
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,860
one's missing. There's 47, not 48.

252
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,860
In an investigation, details matter.

253
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,070
Brick of heroin's a hell of a detail.

254
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,080
That's impossible. I counted 48 at point of sale.

255
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,410
Either you miscounted or they palmed one back to short you.

256
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,710
No, no, no. You do shit like that, you're not in the game for long.

257
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,920
I know we loaded 48 bricks into Swan's ride.

258
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,130
Let's check your car.

259
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,060
Nothing.

260
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,410
Mystery solved.

261
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,290
Must have fallen back there when I was driving and gotten stuck.

262
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,960
Guess the first round's on me tonight for that fuckup.

263
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,260
Losing a key of H, I'd say that's worth two rounds.

264
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,770
What?

265
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,230
Nothing.

266
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,240
I'd actually forgotten about that, but it doesn't support your argument.

267
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,790
Swan could have been stealing drugs and just panicked and gave them back.

268
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,410
Maybe he regretted letting a chance at big money go by.

269
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,960
Maybe something like Little Wing came along

270
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,000
and he couldn't pass up that kind of opportunity again.

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,340
That's a lot of maybes. My gut tells me he's a good man.

272
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,920
Your gut's never been wrong before?

273
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,300
You know what I think?

274
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,270
You want Swan to be innocent because you hired him into the 110th,

275
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,600
and if he's involved in something like this,

276
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,690
you'd do something stupid like blame yourself for our friends' deaths.

277
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,940
Which, like I said, would be stupid.

278
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,110
Let's just see what O'Donnell found.

279
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,210
- Mr. Mason? - Dr. Elzogby.

280
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,790
So, I read your intake, and upon first glance, I got to say,

281
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,800
got a few questions.

282
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,800
Look, I like a payday as much as the next guy, but you're quite a handsome fella.

283
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,800
Now, I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, but

284
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,970
are you really certain you want me to give you a new face?

285
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,350
In a manner of speaking.

286
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,860
Don't struggle.

287
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,160
You're a doctor, you know what's happening.

288
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,700
Your trachea is severed.

289
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,000
Blood is entering your lungs, you're drowning,

290
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,920
your brain is deprived of oxygen and your nervous system's shutting down.

291
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,000
So, by now, you can barely see me

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
and now you can't hear me and now...

293
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,930
...you're dead.

294
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,610
I'm just gonna go and have a word with your secretary.

295
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,430
Daniel Boyd, Senator Lavoy's legislative director.

296
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,350
Spoiled dipshit who's never lifted anything heavier

297
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,220
than a Grey Goose bottle in his life.

298
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,180
C-plus student who got into UVA and Georgetown Law

299
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,980
thanks to Mommy and Daddy's connections. Real party boy.

300
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,190
Two dismissed DWIs in college.

301
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,030
Second year of law school, gets caught with a sex worker.

302
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,190
Charges mysteriously disappeared.

303
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,490
Took his 2.3 GPA straight into private practice.

304
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,200
And now he drafts legislation that decides the fate of the free world,

305
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,040
telling his boss to vote on whatever benefits the lobbyists who wooed him best.

306
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,290
So, he was born somewhere between third and home base

307
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,080
and never heard the word "consequence."

308
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,670
You gonna pull a few moves from your sleazy-adjacent playbook?

309
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,300
That's the general idea.

310
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,880
Boyd's gonna be in Boston tonight for a fundraiser event at the Pops.

311
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,340
We'll set him up like a bowling pin.

312
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,930
Yeah. You pick up the phone.

313
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,480
I thought maybe you couldn't answer because you broke your hand

314
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,820
when you drove the fucking car through the office building.

315
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,820
I didn't get hurt at all.

316
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,940
You think this is funny?

317
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,360
I told you no more cowboy shit.

318
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,700
The car belonged to one of their employees.

319
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,780
I was returning it.

320
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,280
Listen, wiseass,

321
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,490
my boss almost punched my ticket because of you.

322
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,120
Well, maybe that's a good thing

323
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,580
'cause members of my unit are falling from the sky like raindrops and you haven't done shit.

324
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,130
Hey, hey. I want everything you got on New Age.

325
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,420
- You understand? - Fine.

326
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,590
That's why I answered the phone this time. I actually have a reason to talk to you.

327
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,430
I'm gonna send you their security team roster.

328
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,930
Run background checks, see what connections these guys have.

329
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,510
W... Wait, wait, wait. What do you think-- I'm here to do your clerical work?

330
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,430
Yup.

331
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,930
We're busy heading off to Boston.

332
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,270
What's in Boston?

333
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,350
The symphony.

334
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,770
Goddamn it.

335
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,070
Before we head north, though, Dixon and I should go talk to Marlo Burns,

336
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,440
step on her neck a little bit.

337
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,650
Address is online.

338
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,030
Right there is why I don't have a house. Yeah, that's the reason.

339
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,790
So, while we do all the work, what are you guys gonna do?

340
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,120
Oh, we're gonna go score some drugs.

341
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,430
Howdy.

342
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,770
Oh, shit. Five-O! Five-O!

343
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,680
Well, that's just rude.

344
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,360
This just ain't your week.

345
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,340
Find a new line of work, asshole.

346
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,930
She's got a kid.

347
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,320
House clear.

348
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,110
Affirmative.

349
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,200
Anything interesting?

350
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,250
I mean, just some expensive jewelry Marlo left behind.

351
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,370
Left behind?

352
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,000
Think she bugged out?

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,710
She exited out the back door without locking it,

354
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,260
clothes are all over, clearly packed in a hurry.

355
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,050
Closet and... cabinets are open.

356
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,230
Well, she took her toothbrush and toothpaste.

357
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,530
Kidnappers don't care about oral hygiene.

358
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,410
Jane's a gamer.

359
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,240
Got good taste.

360
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,370
Uh, you might want to come and see this.

361
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,720
Who the hell goes on the lam and leaves their cash stash behind?

362
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,390
Apparently, Marlo Burns.

363
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,140
So, to confirm, you've reserved a Cadillac Escalade,

364
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,650
to be returned within three days' time to JFK Airport.

365
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,730
That's correct.

366
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,320
And to thank you for your loyalty,

367
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,450
we've upgraded you to a SiriusXM Platinum listening experience, free of charge.

368
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,110
Wonderful.

369
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,410
Thank you for your business, Dr. Elzogby. Have a wonderful drive.

370
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
Would you like this?

371
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,930
Do you know why I love comic books so much?

372
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,980
Well, look at you.

373
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,650
Don't you feel more civilized now, Ms. Doolittle?

374
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,190
Wait, where are the clothes you were wearing? Garbage.

375
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,320
Garbage, why?

376
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm already carrying boots.

377
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,080
If I had any more clothes, pretty soon I'd need a suitcase.

378
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I got a suitcase, I need a house to keep it in.

379
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,120
Then I need a car for the driveway.

380
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
Before you know it, I'm filling out all kinds of forms.

381
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,460
So, a spare shirt's just too much of an attachment for you?

382
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,380
Anyone ever diagnose you as a sociopath?

383
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,470
Diagnosed? No.

384
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,100
So... what do you make of Marlo Burns taking off

385
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,060
with just some clothes and leaving all that cash behind?

386
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,600
Not sure yet.

387
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,310
Well, she did take her toothbrush.

388
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,230
She could be your soul mate.

389
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,320
Shut up.

390
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,450
Not one word.

391
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,990
Holy shit. That's two words.

392
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,040
Another one, and I'll shove this kitten heel right up your ass.

393
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,370
I'm just saying you look nice. You both look nice.

394
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,290
We look like the assholes on top of a wedding cake.

395
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,550
Here, I'll pay you back in a month when my pension lands.

396
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,090
Yeah, your pension won't cover that suit.

397
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,630
Or the hotel room. Or the plane ticket.

398
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,220
I'll pay you back in two months.

399
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,390
Okay.

400
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,140
Everyone ready?

401
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,480
Let's go listen to some boring-ass music.

402
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,020
Okay.

403
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,400
And, uh, close your mouth, boss. You're catching flies.

404
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,130
Excuse me.

405
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,470
Thank you. Pardon me.

406
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,390
- Excuse me. - Of course. Okay.

407
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,560
Oh, no, it's...

408
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,100
Apologies. Not at all.

409
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,650
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm a little turned around. I don't know if I have

410
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,770
orchestra seats or floor box seats,

411
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,030
and I actually don't even know what that means.

412
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,820
- Okay, well... - Do you mind? Let's just see what we got here.

413
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,240
Hmm, the mezzanine, that's where you are, but... Okay.

414
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,830
that just simply won't cut it. You see, you want to be down here.

415
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,370
The sound, it just wraps around you like a fleece.

416
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,750
How about I swap your ticket with my aide when he arrives?

417
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,670
Wouldn't he mind?

418
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,670
Well, not if he wants to keep his job.

419
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,800
Please, take a seat.

420
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,710
Thank you.

421
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,850
In the bag.

422
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,100
We go 13/14s. 8/13s.

423
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,190
Over seven months, six-day working weeks.

424
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,400
Maybe a time sheet clocking hours? Maybe a ratings scale? I don't know.

425
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,860
Top you off?

426
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,280
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

427
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,740
And when you get the chance, could you bring me the bill? This guy doesn't have any money.

428
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,780
Sure. Let me tally it up for you.

429
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,580
Great.

430
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,620
It's a tally.

431
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,700
What?

432
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,660
Here.

433
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,170
13/14ths.

434
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,380
Something happened 13 times when it was supposed to happen 14 times.

435
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,800
Uh, here, 11 out of 13. Eight out of 11.

436
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,470
Hey, bud, I just...

437
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,800
Okay, what did I tell you?

438
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,850
Hands are for helping, not hitting.

439
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,520
Apologize to your brother. Share your Legos, okay?

440
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
I love you.

441
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,060
To the moon and back.

442
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,980
Okay, bye for now.

443
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,570
Sorry, I don't know why I gave them my burner number, uh...

444
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,570
Well, you look happy.

445
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,450
I did the math.

446
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,290
There were 2,197 total events, whatever they were.

447
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,540
But they only succeeded 1,547 times. But that's not the interesting number.

448
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,290
Look how many times they didn't get the outcome they wanted.

449
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,460
2,197 minus 1,547.

450
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,010
Six hundred and fifty. Holy shit.

451
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,970
Six fifty at 100K each.

452
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,550
It's all connected somehow.

453
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,600
So...

454
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,480
So... hands are for helping?

455
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,610
You have brass knuckles in your pocket.

456
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,070
I got a PAW Patrol Band-Aid and some playground sand, too.

457
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,240
Look, they call nonstop when I'm not there.

458
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,820
And when I am there, it's, you know,

459
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,370
7:00 a.m. weekend soccer games,

460
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,740
teacher conferences,

461
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,870
scheduled sex with the wife.

462
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,460
I am no longer my own man.

463
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,670
And you wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

464
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,210
Not for $65 million.

465
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,340
You are a changed man, O'Donnell.

466
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,510
Yep. Maybe you should give it a go, huh?

467
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,760
Buy some land, start a family.

468
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,770
You'd be the scariest guy at PTA, but you'd be a good dad.

469
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,270
- If I had land, I'd get four or five... - Four or five dogs.

470
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,520
You'd get four or five dogs, no woman?

471
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,650
Not even Dixon?

472
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,570
She's a friend.

473
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,410
Okay.

474
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,160
Whatever you say. That was some dress, though.

475
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,660
Hell of a dress.

476
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,130
From Neagley. It's intermission.

477
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,710
Dixon and Boyd are leaving now.

478
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
There they are.

479
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,430
That's one hell of a dress.

480
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,600
My car's around the corner. Does that work?

481
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,060
I'll follow anywhere you lead, gorgeous.

482
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,730
- Well, let's go party. - Okay.

483
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,690
Look at her.

484
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,350
Boyd didn't stand a chance.

485
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,610
Neagley again. She says my guy's in place.

486
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,700
Hey, this friend of yours. He's gonna come through for us, yeah?

487
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:27,120
If he was in the Army, I'd have asked him to join the 110th.

488
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,000
Come here.

489
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Oh, you're all riled up.

490
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,090
Well, what can I say? Classical music gets my motor running.

491
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,630
Yeah, well, drop it to second, Speed Racer. Let's have a little primer first.

492
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,720
You're not messing around. All right.

493
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,140
- There we go. Ooh. Ooh. - Yeah. Yes.

494
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Okay, hold this. Hold... hold that.

495
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,060
I never know how thick or thin to make these things.

496
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,310
Hey, allow me.

497
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,690
Thank you.

498
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,910
Okay. Ladies first?

499
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,870
Oh, no, you did the work, you get the reward.

500
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,990
If you insist.

501
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,170
Shit. Shit. Just-just play it cool, just play it cool. Just play it cool.

502
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,090
Sir, you're gonna want to put the drugs away and step out of the car.

503
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,060
They're not my drugs.

504
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,270
Which drugs--

505
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,770
the ones on your mirror or up your nose?

506
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,610
You think I own a makeup mirror? They're all hers.

507
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,150
Not what she's saying, and she wasn't holding it.

508
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,070
And she already offered up blood and urine.

509
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,820
Do you want to offer up blood and urine?

510
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,910
Listen, Officer,

511
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,740
I hate putting it this way, but... do you know who I am?

512
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,950
I do, actually, Mr. Boyd.

513
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,960
And I know that woman in the car wasn't Mrs. Boyd.

514
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,250
And I have a special distaste for people

515
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,510
who don't appreciate the sanctity of marriage.

516
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,340
I also know you work for Senator Lavoy.

517
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,390
But when I ran your name in the system,

518
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,970
it set off bells and whistles at the local FBI office.

519
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,310
They sent a couple of their boys down here just to talk to you.

520
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,150
And it seems they don't care who your boss is.

521
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,950
Special Agent Jack Margrave.

522
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,370
This is Special Agent Blake.

523
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,160
Lieutenant Oscar Finlay.

524
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,910
Yeah, I'm not talking without my lawyer.

525
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,370
You want to lawyer up?

526
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,420
Fine. Call them.

527
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,210
I will. And they'll have me out of here within the hour.

528
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,300
You know...

529
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,680
...that's just gonna be too late.

530
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,840
Because by the time they get here,

531
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,760
we'll already have the story of a senator's legislative director

532
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,140
in the wrong woman's car with a snout full of booger sugar

533
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,600
on the front page of the Globe and the Herald.

534
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,610
You see,

535
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,360
this is not college or law school, son.

536
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,070
You're not some spoiled rich kid barely rocking a C-plus.

537
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,490
You're a Beltway man now.

538
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,910
Kind of guy that people enjoy knocking down a peg or two.

539
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,950
So these charges,

540
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,580
they're not just gonna get swept under the rug.

541
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,000
We're not gonna let 'em.

542
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,130
Want to know why?

543
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,670
Okay. Why?

544
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,960
'Cause we don't like you.

545
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,720
I don't even know why you're here.

546
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,010
We're here 'cause we want to know everything there is to know

547
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,930
about Little Wing.

548
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,810
- I should probably... - Yeah, you should.

549
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,150
Yeah. I'm gonna call Mr. Boyd's wife.

550
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,690
Eh, she's probably worried about him over in D.C.

551
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,690
Worried sick.

552
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,530
You know, happy wife, happy life, huh?

553
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,110
Okay. Fine.

554
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,820
- Hello? - Wrong number.

555
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,870
Talk.

556
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,200
It's not that big of a deal.

557
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,830
Little Wing is just a code name.

558
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,830
For what?

559
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,750
For a new technology currently in development.

560
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,880
Some incredible anti-missile software

561
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,460
originally developed to protect commercial aircraft,

562
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,380
but a certain aeronautics company approached us.

563
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,840
Let me guess--

564
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,180
New Age?

565
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,890
That's right. New Age.

566
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,930
They found the software could be tweaked.

567
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,600
It could be used in missiles and not just against them.

568
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,600
It could be scaled down

569
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,360
and installed in portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air weaponry.

570
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,440
The software allows missiles to defeat

571
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,940
all known countermeasures. How?

572
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,110
That's a question for a nerd in a lab coat, man.

573
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,780
Okay? All I know is

574
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,870
that missiles shot from the ground completely bypass their target,

575
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,540
making pilots believe the threat has passed,

576
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,920
and then they recalibrate, turn around,

577
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,290
zero back in on the aircraft and reattack.

578
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,170
It's death from above and there is no way to avoid it.

579
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,720
You fire, you hit your target. Period.

580
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,640
And what's Senator Lavoy's involvement?

581
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,810
Well, the project required an appropriation bill, all right?

582
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,140
You want to get one passed?

583
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,520
You're looking at years of bureaucratic bullshit

584
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,230
all thanks to some arcane laws on modifying civilian tech.

585
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,900
But Lavoy knew Little Wing would slingshot our military into the future,

586
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,200
so if we just sat on our hands,

587
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,700
waiting for it to go through the proper channels,

588
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,990
it would never happen.

589
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,540
So I'm assuming Lavoy didn't clear up the red tape

590
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,620
in the most reputable manner?

591
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,670
I helped bury the proposal in a thousand-page statute

592
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,170
while Lavoy shook hands and drummed up votes.

593
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,840
No one even knew it was in there.

594
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,130
And he did this out of the goodness of his heart?

595
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,510
To protect democracy?

596
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,520
No fat envelopes slipped inside newspapers on park benches?

597
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,270
Grow the fuck up, okay?

598
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,230
It's D.C. It's how shit gets done.

599
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,900
Besides, Lavoy knew Little Wing would save lives.

600
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,230
I mean...

601
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,150
everyone made fun of the Star Wars defense program,

602
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,700
but, hey, look at where we are now.

603
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,660
Everyone's trying to shoot projectiles out of the air.

604
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,160
Little Wing can knock anything out of the sky.

605
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,460
Anything?

606
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,090
Like commercial aircraft?

607
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,840
You fire, you hit the target.

608
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,670
You said so yourself. Yeah, but it's our tech. We have it.

609
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,590
Nobody else can get their hands on it.

610
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,890
Nothing like you're thinking is going to happen.

611
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,520
New Age is incredibly secure. Both of their facilities

612
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,930
- implement state-of-the-art... - Both facilities?

613
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,310
What do you mean?

614
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,850
New Age has two bases.

615
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,060
Software made in New York,

616
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,650
hardware at a manufacturing plant in Denver.

617
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,780
What else can you tell us?

618
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,360
Nothing. That's all I know. I swear.

619
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,620
Hey, Lavoy and me-- we-we cut some corners,

620
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,990
we did some stuff we should not have done,

621
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,370
but it was all to get a defense bill passed,

622
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,710
protect the country.

623
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,250
How'd that work out?

624
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,840
Hey, excuse me. So, are the drug charges getting dropped or what?

625
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,300
I don't know. I'm not a cop.

626
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,690
Heck of a surprise getting a call from you.

627
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,650
Hell of a surprise hearing you're wearing the badge again.

628
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,980
Lieutenant, no less.

629
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,110
Yeah, well, retirement didn't suit me.

630
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,570
Speaking of suits, see you're still sporting the tweed.

631
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,570
Reliable as ever, Finlay.

632
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,620
Speak for yourself.

633
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,120
What was it you told me when we first met--

634
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
trouble always seems to find you?

635
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,630
You kill a whole lot of people?

636
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,880
Here and there. You need my help?

637
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Already gave it.

638
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,720
You still spinning that wedding ring?

639
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,970
Here and there. But feeling better every day.

640
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,390
- And the dog? - Jack eats too much.

641
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,640
Just like his namesake.

642
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,110
Today, boss. Car's running, and if I don't get out of this straitjacket soon,

643
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,860
things are gonna get ugly. Neagley?

644
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,820
Didn't recognize you. Looking good.

645
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,030
Mind your business, elbow patches.

646
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,280
Hey, you heard the lady.

647
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,490
If I don't have her in jeans in 20 minutes,

648
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,830
I'm done for.

649
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,330
See you around, Reacher.

650
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,330
See you around, Finlay.

651
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,350
So, Little Wing could be our next 9/11.

652
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,560
What are our directives?

653
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,140
You and Dixon go to Denver.

654
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,600
The Little Wing software is useless without the missile hardware,

655
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,060
and that's where it's made.

656
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,690
Maybe you can gum up the works, keep the missiles out of the wrong hands.

657
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,230
O'Donnell and I will head down to D.C.

658
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,110
Want to swing by Homeland, see what they know about A.M.

659
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,990
If taking out airplanes is his M.O., they might have some intel on him.

660
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,490
How do you figure we're gonna do that?

661
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,080
You think we're just gonna knock on the door and say, "Can the DoD come out and play?"

662
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,000
My brother worked for Homeland.

663
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,330
His contacts can help us.

664
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,130
Oh, no shit. How's Joe doing these days?

665
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,380
He's dead.

666
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,720
I'm starving. We should eat.

667
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,990
Dibs on the bathroom. I need to get changed.

668
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,500
Yeah? You gonna throw it in the garbage like our sociopathic friend here?

669
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,790
Oh, why, you want to borrow it?

670
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,620
Oh, yeah. I got the ass for it.

671
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,260
Hate to ruin prom night,

672
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,720
but hand over your guns.

673
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,730
What makes you think we have guns?

674
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,940
We were told you'd be packing, Reacher.

675
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,740
They also tell you you'd die tonight?

676
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,410
I'll die? That's funny.

677
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,830
No guns, so no noise.

678
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,330
They said you were smart.

679
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm gonna cut you,

680
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,500
gut you

681
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,590
and leave you...

682
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,630
Everyone okay?

683
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Yeah. It'll heal.

684
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,930
Never better.

685
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,100
Fucked up my shoes,

686
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,310
but I'm fine.

687
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,950
Yeah.

688
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,820
Before you ask if it's done, it is,

689
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,370
just not in the way you hoped for.

690
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,160
You're causing a very complex operation a lot of problems.

691
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,790
Sixty-five million dollars worth, Langston?

692
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,000
Assume that's who I'm talking to.

693
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,920
Head of security?

694
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,170
Head of this whole thing?

695
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,800
Maybe we've been approaching this the wrong way, Mr. Reacher.

696
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,300
Just Reacher.

697
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,140
Okay, Reacher. Why don't we make a deal?

698
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,600
I have the means to give you anything you could ask for.

699
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,310
What is it that you want?

700
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,900
I want to throw you out of a helicopter.
