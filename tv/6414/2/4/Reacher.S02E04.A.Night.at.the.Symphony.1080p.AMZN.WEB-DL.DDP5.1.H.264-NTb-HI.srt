Don't add it to the stats sheets

320

People in our profession

323
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,685
Then these assholes make
more money selling this shit

324
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,353

325

327
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,070
How much is 48 bricks
worth, anyway?

328
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,990
47. one's missing. There's 47,

329
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,658
not 48.

330
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,869
In an investigation,
details matter.

331
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,871
Brick of heroin's
a hell of a detail.

332
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,082
That's impossible.
I counted 48 at point of sale.

333
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,127
Either you miscounted or they
palmed one back to short you.

334
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,212
[Orozco] No, no, no.
You do shit like that,

335
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,274

Let's check your car.

338
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,109
[Neagley] Nothing.

339
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,290
[Swan] Ah.

340
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,335
Mystery solved.

341
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,231
Must have fallen back there when
I was driving and gotten stuck.

342
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,543
Guess the first round's on me
tonight for that fuckup.

343
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,348
Losing a key of H,

344
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,308
I'd say that's worth two rounds.

345
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,771
What?

346
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,231
Nothing.

347
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,453
I'd actually
forgotten about that,

348
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,247
but it doesn't
support your argument.

349
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,748
Swan could have been
stealing drugs

350
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,209
and just panicked
and gave them back.

351
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,312
Maybe he regretted letting
a chance at big money go by.

352
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,016
Maybe something like
Little Wing came along

353
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,024
and he couldn't pass up
that kind of opportunity again.

354
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,049
That's a lot of maybes.

355
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,176
My gut tells me he's a good man.

356
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,970
Your gut's never been
wrong before?

357
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,266
You know what I think?

358
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,644
You want Swan
to be innocent because

359
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,271
you hired him into the 110th,

360
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,147
and if he's involved
in something like this,

361
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,607
you'd do something stupid like

362
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,651
blame yourself
for our friends' deaths.

363
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,987
Which, like I said,
would be stupid.

So, I read your intake,

368
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,591
and upon first glance,
I got to say,

369
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,800
got a few questions.

370
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,428
Look, I like a payday
as much as the next guy,

371
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,822
but you're quite

374
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,476
are you really certain you
want me to give you a new face?

375
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,023
In a manner of speaking.

You're a doctor,

Your trachea is severed.

Blood is entering your lungs,
you're drowning,

your brain
is deprived of oxygen

383
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,173
and your nervous system's
shutting down. So, by now,

you can barely see me

385
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,594
and now you can't hear me

00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,932
Closet and...

476
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,643
cabinets are open.

477
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,987
Well, she took
her toothbrush and toothpaste.

478
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,407
Kidnappers don't care
about oral hygiene.

479
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,451
Jane's a gamer.

480
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,248
Got good taste.

481
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,459
Uh, you might want
to come and see this.

482
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,846
Who the hell goes on the lam

483
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,764
and leaves
their cash stash behind?

484
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,352
Apparently, Marlo Burns.

485
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,521
[rental agent] So, to confirm,

486
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,398
you've reserved
a Cadillac Escalade,

487
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,234
to be returned within
three days' time to JFK Airport.

488
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,819
[A.M.] That's correct.

489
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,422
[rental agent] And to thank you
for your loyalty,

490
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,489
we've upgraded you
to a SiriusXM Platinum

491
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,324
listening experience,
free of charge.

492
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,909
Wonderful.

493
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,679
[rental agent] Thank you
for your business, Dr. Elzogby.

494
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,538
Have a wonderful drive.

495
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,463
Would you like this?

496
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,016
Do you know why
I love comic books so much?

497
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,814
Oh.

498
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,859
Well, look at you.

499
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,361
Don't you feel more civilized
now, Ms. Doolittle?

500
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,257
Wait, where are the clothes
you were wearing?

501
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,199
Garbage.

502
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,117
Garbage, why?

503
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,702
I'm already carrying boots.

504
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,106
If I had any more clothes,
pretty soon I'd need a suitcase.

505
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,082
I got a suitcase,
I need a house to keep it in.

506
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,084
Then I need a car
for the driveway.

507
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,228
Before you know it, I'm
filling out all kinds of forms.

508
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,630
So, a spare shirt's just too
much of an attachment for you?

509
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,383
Anyone ever diagnose you
as a sociopath?

510
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,344
Diagnosed?

511
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,429
No.

512
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,183
So...

513
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,018
what do you make
of Marlo Burns taking off

514
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,871
with just some clothes and
leaving all that cash behind?

515
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,439
Not sure yet.

516
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,233
Well, she did take
her toothbrush.

517
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,069
[gasps] She could be
your soul mate.

518
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,196
Shut up.

519
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,409
Not one word.

520
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,702
Holy shit.

521
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,913
{\an8}That's two words. Another one,

522
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,040
{\an8}and I'll shove this kitten heel
right up your ass.

523
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,335
I'm just saying you look nice.
You both look nice.

524
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,296
We look like the assholes
on top of a wedding cake.

525
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,882
Here, I'll pay you back in
a month when my pension lands.

526
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,051
Yeah, your pension
won't cover that suit.

527
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,637
Or the hotel room.
Or the plane ticket.

528
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,222
I'll pay you back in two months.

529
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,766
Okay.

530
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,146
Everyone ready?

531
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,481
Let's go listen
to some boring-ass music.

532
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,066
Okay.

533
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,864
And, uh, close your mouth, boss.

534
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,532
You're catching flies.

535
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,535
<i>[orchestra warming up]</i>

536
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,469
Excuse me.

537
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,471
Thank you. Pardon me.

538
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,307
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

539
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,516
Okay.

540
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,476
Oh, no, it's...

541
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,312
- Oh. [laughs]
- Apologies.

542
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,063
Not at all.

543
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,357
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm a little turned around.

544
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,569
I don't know if I have orchestra
seats or floor box seats,

545
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,696
and I actually don't even know
what that means.

546
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,939
- Okay, well...
- Do you mind?

547
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,824
Let's just see what we got here.

548
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,118
Hmm, the mezzanine,
that's where you are, but...

549
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,054
- Okay.
- [sharp inhale] that just simply won't cut it.

550
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,622
You see, you want
to be down here.

551
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,373
The sound,
it just wraps around you

552
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,626
- like a fleece.
- [chuckles]

553
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,520
How about I swap your ticket
with my aide when he arrives?

554
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,671
[short chuckle]
Wouldn't he mind?

555
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,590
Well, not if he wants
to keep his job.

556
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,800
Please, take a seat.

557
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,719
Thank you.

558
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,808
In the bag.

559
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,353
We go 13/14s.

560
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,104
8/13s.

561
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,190
Over seven months,
six-day working weeks.

562
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,334
Maybe a time sheet
clocking hours?

563
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,276
Maybe a ratings scale?

564
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,444
I don't know.

565
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,154
- Top you off?
- Yeah.

566
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,447
Yes, ma'am.

567
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,117
And when you get the chance,
could you bring me the bill?

568
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,744
This guy doesn't have any money.

569
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,121
[waitress] Sure.
Let me tally it up for you.

570
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,624
[O'Donnell] Great. [sniffles]

571
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,709
- It's a tally.
- What?

572
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,170
Here. 13/14ths.

573
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:47,463
Something happened 13 times

574
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,382
when it was supposed
to happen 14 times.

575
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,801
Uh, here, 11 out of 13.
Eight out of 11.

576
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,136
[phone vibrating]

577
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,430
Hey, bud, I just...

578
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,807
Okay, what did I tell you?

579
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,810
Hands are for helping,
not hitting.

580
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,728
Apologize to your brother.

581
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,522
Share your Legos, okay?

582
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,650
I love you.
To the moon and back.

583
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,944
Okay, bye for now.

584
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,530
[clears throat] Sorry,
I don't know why I gave them

585
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,573
my burner number, uh...

586
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,576
Well, you look happy.

587
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,078
I did the math.

588
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,999
There were 2,197 total events,
whatever they were.

589
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,960
But they only succeeded
1,547 times.

590
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,271
But that's not
the interesting number.

591
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,397
Look how many times
they didn't get

592
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,755
the outcome they wanted.

593
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,592
2,197 minus 1,547.

594
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,971
Six hundred and fifty.
Holy shit.

595
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,724
Six fifty at 100K each.

596
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,559
It's all connected somehow.

597
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,269
So...

598
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,440
So... hands are for helping?

599
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,983
[laughs]

600
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,860
You have brass knuckles
in your pocket.

601
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,196
I got a <i>PAW Patrol</i> Band-Aid
and some playground sand, too.

602
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,240
Look, they call nonstop
when I'm not there.

603
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:59,660
And when I am there,
it's, you know,

604
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,789
7:00 a.m. weekend soccer games,
teacher conferences,

605
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,916
scheduled sex with the wife.

606
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,462
I am no longer my own man.

607
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,630
And you wouldn't trade it
for anything in the world.

608
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,216
Not for $65 million.

609
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,385
You are a changed man,
O'Donnell.

610
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,556
Yep. Maybe you should
give it a go, huh?

611
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,141
Buy some land, start a family.

612
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,560
You'd be the scariest guy
at PTA,

613
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,771
but you'd be a good dad.

614
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,231
- If I had land, I'd get four or five...
- Four or five dogs.

615
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:33,527
You'd get four or five dogs,
no woman?

616
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,780
Not even Dixon?

617
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,077
- She's a friend.
- [laughs]

618
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,870
Okay.

619
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,247
Whatever you say.

620
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,166
That was some dress, though.

621
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,669
Hell of a dress.

622
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,130
[phone vibrates]

623
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,132
From Neagley. It's intermission.

624
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,717
Dixon and Boyd are leaving now.

625
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,803
[O'Donnell] There they are.

626
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,431
That's one hell of a dress.

627
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,600
My car's around the corner.
Does that work?

628
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,394
I'll follow anywhere
you lead, gorgeous.

629
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,772
- Well, let's go party.
- Okay.

630
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,732
[Reacher] Look at her.

631
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:15,027
- Boyd didn't stand a chance.
- [phone vibrates]

632
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,487
Neagley again.

633
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,656
- She says my guy's in place.
- Mm.

634

Little Wing is just a code name.

- For what?
- For a new technology

723
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,755
currently in development.

724
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,548
Some incredible
anti-missile software

725
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:07,468
originally developed
to protect commercial aircraft,

726
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,054
but a certain aeronautics
company approached us.

727
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,973
Let me guess... New Age?

728
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,683
[Boyd] That's right. New Age.

729
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,518
They found the software
could be tweaked.

730
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,563
It could be used in missiles
and not just against them.

731
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,899
It could be scaled down
and installed

732
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,027
in portable shoulder-fired
surface-to-air weaponry.

733
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,945
The software allows missiles

734
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,782
to defeat all known
countermeasures.

735
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,617
- How?
- That's a question

736
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,118
for a nerd in a lab coat, man.

737
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,830
Okay? All I know is that
missiles shot from the ground

738
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,874
completely bypass their target,

739
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,210
making pilots believe
the threat has passed,

740
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,921
and then they recalibrate,
turn around,

741
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,298
zero back in on the aircraft
and reattack.

742
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:49,843
It's death from above
and there is no way to avoid it.

743
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:52,388
You fire, you hit your target.

744
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,098
Period.

745
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,644
And what's Senator Lavoy's
involvement?

746
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,355
Well, the project required an
appropriation bill, all right?

747
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,773
You want to get one passed?

748
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,526
You're looking at years
of bureaucratic bullshit

749
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,238
all thanks to some arcane laws
on modifying civilian tech.

750
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,074
But Lavoy knew Little Wing
would slingshot

751
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:16,203
our military into the future,
so if we just sat on our hands,

752
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,330
waiting for it to go through
the proper channels,

753
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,999
it would never happen.

754
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,127
So I'm assuming Lavoy
didn't clear up the red tape

755
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,421
in the most reputable manner?

756
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,674
I helped bury the proposal
in a thousand-page statute

757
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,360
while Lavoy shook hands
and drummed up votes.

758
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,010
No one even knew
it was in there.

759
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:35,139
And he did this out of
the goodness of his heart?

760
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,516
To protect democracy?

761
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,562
No fat envelopes slipped inside
newspapers on park benches?

762
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,272
Grow the fuck up, okay?

763
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,233
It's D.C.
It's how shit gets done.

764
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,528
Besides, Lavoy knew Little Wing
would save lives.

765
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,155
I mean... [chortles]

we are now.

768
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,705
Everyone's trying to shoot
projectiles out of the air.

769
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,208
Little Wing can knock
anything out of the sky.

770
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:09,840
Anything?
Like commercial aircraft?

771
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,551
You fire, you hit the target.
You said so yourself.

772
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,887
Yeah, but it's our tech.
We have it.

773
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,139
Nobody else can
get their hands on it.

774
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,308
Nothing like you're thinking
is going to happen.

777
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,442

- What else can you tell us?
- Nothing.

781
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,408
That's all I know. I swear.

782
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,162
Hey, Lavoy and me...
we-we cut some corners,

783
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,456
we did some stuff
we should not have done,

784
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,334
but it was all to get

786

I don't know. I'm not a cop.

790
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,148
Heck of a surprise
getting a call from you.

791
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:11,360
Hell of a surprise hearing
you're wearing the badge again.

792
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,986
Lieutenant, no less.

793
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,113
Yeah, well,
retirement didn't suit me.

794
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,575
Speaking of suits, see
you're still sporting the tweed.

795
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,578
Reliable as ever, Finlay.

796
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,413
Speak for yourself.

797
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,833
What was it you told me
when we first met...

798
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,293
trouble always seems
to find you?

799
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,630
You kill a whole lot of people?

800
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,090
Here and there.

801
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,884
- You need my help?
- Already gave it.

802
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,720
You still spinning
that wedding ring?

803
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,977
Here and there.
But feeling better every day.

804
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,062
- And the dog?
- Jack eats too much.

805
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,605
Just like his namesake.

806
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,148
[Neagley] Today, boss.

807
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,900
Car's running,
and if I don't get out

808
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,069
of this straitjacket soon,
things are gonna get ugly.

809
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,988
Neagley?

810
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,824
Didn't recognize you.
Looking good.

811
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,076
Mind your business,
elbow patches.

812
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,288
Hey, you heard the lady.

813
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,040
If I don't have her in jeans
in 20 minutes,

814
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,876
I'm done for.

815
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,336
See you around, Reacher.

816
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,338
See you around, Finlay.

817
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,351
So, Little Wing
could be our next 9/11.

818
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,146
- What are our directives?
- You and Dixon go to Denver.

819
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,731
The Little Wing software
is useless

820
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,542
without the missile hardware,
and that's where it's made.

821
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,901
Maybe you can gum up the works,

822
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,861
keep the missiles
out of the wrong hands.

823
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,864
O'Donnell and I
will head down to D.C.

824
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,159
Want to swing by Homeland,
see what they know about A.M.

825
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,469
If taking out airplanes
is his M.O.,

826
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,828
they might have
some intel on him.

827
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,556
[O'Donnell] How do you figure
we're gonna do that?

828
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,891
You think we're just gonna
knock on the door

829
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:50,083
and say, "Can the DoD
come out and play?"

830
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,669
My brother worked for Homeland.

831
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,338
His contacts can help us.

832
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,132
Oh, no shit.
How's Joe doing these days?

833
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,425
He's dead.

834
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,725
I'm starving. We should eat.

835
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,120
[exhales] Dibs on the bathroom.

836
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:28,973
- I need to get changed.
- [motorcycles approaching]

837
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,516
Yeah? You gonna
throw it in the garbage

838
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,334
like our sociopathic friend
here?

839
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,752
Oh, why, you want to borrow it?

840
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,462
Oh, yeah. I got the ass for it.

841
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,310
[biker] Hate to ruin prom night,

842
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,728
but hand over your guns.

843
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,730
What makes you think
we have guns?

844
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,066
We were told
you'd be packing, Reacher.

845
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,156
[Reacher] They also tell you

846
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,950
you'd die tonight?

847
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,453
I'll die? That's funny.

848
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,837
No guns, so no noise.

849
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,338
[biker] They said
you were smart.

850
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,466
I'm gonna cut you, gut you

851
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,551
and leave you...

852
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,594
[grunting]

853
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,815

00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,351
Aah!

[engine revs]

859
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,595
Everyone okay?

860
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,722
Yeah. It'll heal.

861
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,474
[O'Donnell groans]

862
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,934
Never better.

863
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,354
Fucked up my shoes,
but I'm fine.

864
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,327
<i>- [Langston] Yeah.</i>
- Before you ask if it's done,

865
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,372
it is, just not in the way
you hoped for.

866
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:19,167
You're causing a very complex
operation a lot of problems.

867
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,795
Sixty-five million dollars
worth, Langston?

868
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,005
Assume that's who
I'm talking to.

869
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,924
Head of security?

870
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,176
Head of this whole thing?

871
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,805
Maybe we've been approaching
this the wrong way, Mr. Reacher.

872
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,057
Just Reacher.

873
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:37,144
<i>Okay, Reacher.
Why don't we make a deal?</i>

874
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:42,232
I have the means to give you
anything you could ask for.

875
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,901
What is it that you want?

876
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,906
I want to throw you
out of a helicopter.
