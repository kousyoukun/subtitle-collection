00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
《烈探雷彻》前情提要
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,050
不管你朋友卷入的是什么事 其金额都大到害死了他们
Well, whatever your friends were involved in was big enough to get them killed.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,970
我招募的托尼斯旺 绝对不可能参与此事
There's no way the Tony Swan I recruited is a part of this.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,550
看来斯旺的职位是安全总监助理
Seems Swan's title was assistant director of security.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,680
“谢恩兰斯顿 安全总监”
"Shane Langston. Director of Security."

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,930
也许在大西洋城 跟我通话的就是这个人
Maybe he's the guy I got on the phone in Atlantic City.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,230
我们得跟马尔科姆拉沃伊谈谈
We need to talk to Malcolm Lavoy.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,610
我们永远没法接近参议员 从他口中套话
We'll never get close enough to a senator to find out what he may or may not know.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,070
我们不需要接近他 丹尼尔博伊德 拉沃伊参议员的立法主任
Oh, we don't need to. Daniel Boyd, Senator Lavoy's legislative director.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,280
小翅膀可以击中空中的任何物体
Little Wing can knock anything out of the sky.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
新时代有两个基地
New Age has two bases.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,330
软件是在纽约开发的 硬件是在丹佛的制造工厂制造的
Software made in New York, hardware at a manufacturing plant in Denver.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,540
我们的指令是什么
What are our directives?

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,870
你和迪克森去丹佛 奥唐纳和我会去华盛顿特区
You and Dixon go to Denver. O'Donnell and I will head down to D.C.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,580
我想去国土安全局 看看他们是否知道AM的事
Want to swing by Homeland, see what they know about A.M.

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,830
给马备好鞍
Saddle up...

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,340
因为我们要去做一大堆牛仔的事
...'cause we're about to do a whole lot of cowboy shit.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,340
再见

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,810
别闹了
Quit it!

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,680
我会抓住你的
I'm gonna get you!

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,100
不 你抓不到的
No, you're not.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,690
别再丢我的泰迪熊了 否则我会...
Don't drop my teddy ever again or I will...

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,110
...你的脸
...at your face.

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,650
住手
Stop it!

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,110
你带肾上腺素笔了吗
- You got the EpiPens? - Yes, of course.

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,410
- 当然带了 - 伍比呢
- And woobie? - Woobie, Panda-pal,

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,160
伍比毯 熊猫朋友 猴子林赛 全都装好了
Lindsay the Monkey, they're all packed.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,870
带上一次性手机 别跟任何人联系 不要找你父母
Grab the burner phone. No contact with anyone. Not your parents,

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,370
而且千万别联系你姐姐 她什么都往脸书上发
and definitely not your sister. She puts everything on Facebook.

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,870
我知道这一套
I know the drill.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,920
去阿什维尔 带男孩们过去 那里有很多事做
Go to Asheville. Take the boys. Plenty for you to do there.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,340
那是旅游胜地 你会融入其中
It's touristy. You'll blend in.

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,760
用现金和现收现付信用卡
Use cash and this pay-as-you-go credit card.

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,590
按从一到十打分 情况有多糟
Scale of one to ten, how bad is this?

35
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,130
他们不会去找你们的
They're not gonna come after you.

36
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,680
我们只是谨慎行事 额外小心
We're just playing it safe. Belts and suspenders.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
按从一到十打分
One to ten.

38
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,770
对于你们来说 最多四分
For you guys? Four, tops.

39
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,350
那你呢
How about you?

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,730
我们正在处理一些相当坏的家伙
Well, we're dealing with some pretty bad guys, but...

41
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,070
但我有朋友在身边 我们会没事的
I got the gang with me. We'll be fine.

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,480
过几天就结束了

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,820
就像上次一样

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,570
把我的泰迪熊还给我
Give my tie back!

46
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,830
我需要你们去...
I need...

她并不惊慌
She doesn't panic.

48
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,200
...去挑你们的衣服

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
既来之 则安之
Accepts reality on reality's terms.

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,960
她是急诊室护士 和芝加哥消防队长的女儿

00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,170
非常坚强
Tough as they come.

52
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,210
漂亮 坚强 聪明
Beautiful, tough, smart.

53
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,420
她打赌输了才嫁给你的
She lose a bet?

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,840
这就是我在做的
...dinner. That's what I'm making.

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,970
如果当初有人问我 你的结局会是怎样
If someone asked me back in the day where I thought you'd wind up,

56
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,930
我会预测你因为淋病慢慢死去
I'd have predicted a slow death from gonorrhea

57
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,600
还会有六个女朋友 为了一辆04年的马自达大打出手
and a half dozen girlfriends fighting over an '04 Miata.

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,190
是啊 原来我并不想要 世界上的每一个女孩
Yeah, well, turns out I didn't want every girl in the world,

59
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,230
只想要对的那个
just the right one.

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,070
你想稍微冷静一下吗

61
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,190
内格利和迪克森刚到丹佛的工厂
Neagley and Dixon just got to the Denver plant.

62
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,200
很好 她们也许能拿到那些导弹
Good. Maybe they get ahold of those missiles

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,990
你的家人就不必离开太久
and your family won't have to be gone long.

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,620
你真慢
You're a slowpoke.

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,620
好的
Okay.

66
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,840
离开几天没关系
A few days wouldn't hurt.

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,760
我会的
I will.

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
科罗拉多州丹佛

69
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,060
国防合约管理局一个月前来过这里
The DCMA was here a month ago.

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,970
是啊 现在我们又回来了
Yeah, and now we're back.

71
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,940
我们可是政府监管的“疱疹” 总是神出鬼没
We're the cold sores of government oversight.

72
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,100
现在 请把你们的领班叫来
Now, if you please? Your foreman?

73
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,730
新时代科技 配送仓库

74
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,690
在这里等着
Wait here.

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,820
真是让我惊叹不已 你拿着写字板 表现自然
Never ceases to amaze me how far you can get into a place

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,580
就好像你就应该在那儿一样
if you just act like you're supposed to be there and carry a clipboard.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
你觉得怎么样
How you feeling?

78
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,580
疼
Sore.

79
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,670
穿着高跟鞋打架 是需要一段时间适应的
Well, fighting in heels takes some getting used to.

80
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,760
穿高跟鞋走路 也需要一段时间适应 我从来没穿过
Walking in heels takes some getting used to. Never wore 'em.

81
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,630
你之前从来不穿高跟鞋
You never wore heels?

82
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,930
不穿
Nope.

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,680
连学校舞会上都不穿
Not even to a school dance?

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,100
从没去过
Never went to one.

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,390
我不学习 或者不照顾我爸的时候 我得去工作
When I wasn't studying or taking care of my dad, I had to work.

86
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,150
也就是糟糕的音乐 温暖的酒水 以及一些摸着你的黏糊糊的手
Well, bad music, warm punch and some clammy hands feeling you up...

87
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,730
你并没有错过太多
you didn't miss much.

88
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,280
没人跟我说你们要来检查
Nobody told me about this.

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,580
如果我们提前通知就不是突击检查了
Wouldn't be a surprise inspection if we called ahead.

90
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,620
山姆大叔想确定 你们把钱用在了正道上
Uncle Sam wants to make sure you're using his money wisely.

91
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,170
所以我们来看看小翅膀肩扛式发射器
So we're here to take a look at Little Wing shoulder-fired launchers and missiles.

92
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,710
以及导弹 检查它们的规格和制造协议
The specs, the manufacturing protocols,

93
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,670
订单以及交货时间表
the order and delivery schedules...

94
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,210
交货时间表
Delivery schedule?

95
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,470
交货时间就在十分钟前
Ten minutes ago. That's the delivery schedule.

96
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,970
所有货物刚运出去
The whole lot just went out the door.

97
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,470
总共650个
All 650 of them.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,020
650
650?

99
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,270
这是相关文件
Here's the paperwork.

100
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,230
如果有人先给我打电话 我本可以推迟交货 给你们留着
If someone had called me first, I'd have held them for you.

101
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,190
- 糟了 - 是啊
- Shit. - Yeah.

102
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,180
嘿
Hey, there.

103
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,400
你需要帮忙吗
You need an extra set of hands?

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,350
我需要的
What I need

105
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,940
是你的卡车
is your truck.

106
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,220
爆炸枪弹

107
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,690
一切按计划进行中
We're in business.

108
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,280
匿名来电

109
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,080
告诉我好消息吧
Give me good news.

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,790
GPS追踪器完成了其使命 你在新时代的同事们还不错
GPS tracker did the job. Your associates at New Age came through.

111
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,290
但是我杀了司机 他们可能会伤心
They might be upset I killed the driver, though.

112
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,800
只要他们能拿到钱就不会在意
Oh, they won't care so long as they get paid.

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,590
永远不要低估贪婪的力量
Never underestimate the power of greed.

114
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,380
- 换车上路吧 - 好的
Switch the trailers and get on the road. Will do.

115
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,800
我们纽约见
Meet you in New York.

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,470
阿扎里马哈茂德

117
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,480
这里这个名字
This name, right here...

118
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,810
阿扎里马哈茂德
...Azhari Mahmoud.

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,570
所以我们在丹佛 追捕的那个阿伦米克洛斯
So, the Aaron Miklos we were chasing down in Denver,

120
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,980
就是马哈茂德
that was Mahmoud?

121
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,860
是的 我们一直叫他“AM”
Yeah, we've been calling him "A.M."

122
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,120
这家伙很聪明 从未被捕 也没有照片
Guy's smart. Never been caught, no photos.

123
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,830
我们甚至都不确定他的国籍
Hell, we're not even sure what nationality he is.

124
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,160
从我们对他仅有的了解来看
From the little bit we know of him,

125
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,580
他可以伪装成中美洲人
he can supposedly pass for Central American,

126
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,540
意大利人 希腊人 中东人...
Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern.

127
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
他如幽灵一般
He's a ghost.

128
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,800
我们有三段他的 简短且无关痛痒的录音
We have three short, innocuous recordings of him.

129
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,670
音频鉴定部证实是同一个人
Audio forensics matched it as the same guy.

130
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,720
他每次都会使用不同的身份
Each time, he's using a different identity.

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,680
意识形态呢
Ideology?

132
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,600
没有政治或宗教背景
No political or religious affiliations.

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,850
对他而言 唯有金钱才是上帝 他为出价最高的人工作
His only god is money, and he works for the highest bidder.

134
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,190
他会接洽坏人 为他们提供做坏事所需的工具
He hooks up bad actors with the tools they need for bad actions.

135
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,310
他在六年前第一次 出现在我们的视线中
First popped up on our radar six years ago.

136
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,690
在恐怖分子试图 获取实验神经毒气罐的时候
Terrorist cell caught trying to acquire tanks of experimental nerve gas.

137
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,030
我们逮捕了整个团队
We scooped up the whole lot.

138
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,820
所有人 除了马哈茂德
All of them except Mahmoud.

139
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,700
不管他叫什么
Or whatever his name is.

140
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,490
幽灵
Ghost.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
这次购买本来应该用无记名债券
This buy was supposed to happen with bearer bonds.

142
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,960
是的 逃税者 洗钱者 和其他各种混蛋的
Yeah, financial instrument of choice for tax evaders,

143
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,130
首选金融工具
money launderers and other assorted assholes.

144
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,380
美国财政部在80年代 就停止发行这些债券了
The U.S. Treasury stopped issuing those in the '80s.

145
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,180
有些国家仍在使用 那些是卢森堡的
Some countries still use them. Those were from Luxembourg.

146
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,470
像AM这么谨慎的人 会使用无记名债券
Someone as cautious as A.M. would use bearer bonds.

147
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,890
如果发行量足够大
If issued in large enough amounts,

148
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,270
你可以用公文包 携带一笔无法追踪的财富
you can carry an untraceable fortune in a briefcase.

149
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,770
价值六千五百万
65 million worth.

150
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,980
那就是问题所在
That's the problem.

151
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,600
你带着一张无记名债券 就像带着一百万美元的钞票
You hold a bearer bond, that's like carrying a million dollar bill.

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,810
它归持有者所有
The bearer owns it.

153
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,570
所以AM不可能 让除他以外的任何人运送酬劳
So no way A.M. lets anyone deliver payment but him.

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,650
这就是他的弱点
That's where he's vulnerable.

155
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
就像你哥哥一样
Just like your brother.

156
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,660
当年我们办案的时候 我问了乔
Back when we worked the case, I asked Joe

157
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,490
一些财务方面的问题
some questions of the financial side of things.

158
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,580
他也是你这么说的
He said same thing you just did.

159
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,920
运送酬劳的会是AM 不会是其他人
A.M. will be the delivery boy. No one else.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,630
好的 我们给你们 看了我们掌握的信息
Okay. We showed you ours.

161
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,670
现在轮到你们了
Now it's your turn.

162
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,640
我们还在整理中
We're still piecing it together, but, uh...

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,390
但我们向你们保证 等时机成熟
we give you our word, when this bird's cooked,

164
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,600
- 我们会联系你们 - 我保证
- we'll reach out. - And you have my word

165
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,230
我们不会再让这家伙 逃出我们的手掌心
we won't let this guy slip through our fingers again.

166
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,770
AM和他的所有同伙
A.M. and everyone working with him

167
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,440
都将受到法律的最大制裁
will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

168
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,860
除非我们先把他们都杀了
Unless we kill them all first.

169
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,540
谢谢你们
Thanks, guys.

170
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,090
跟他哥哥一样
Just like his brother.

171
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,970
烈探雷彻
第二季第五集

172
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,970
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

173
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,620
18轮车在这路上开不快的
18-wheelers can't go that fast on these roads.

174
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,120
我们有机会赶上他们
We've got a decent shot at catching them.

175
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,960
是啊 尤其是他们中途停车了
Yeah, especially if they come to a stop.

176
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,090
这些人是谁
Who are these guys?

177
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,640
会告诉我们卡车坏了的人
They're the guys who are gonna tell us

178
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,730
而且他们不得不 打电话叫另一个人来取车
the truck broke down and they had to call another one to come pick up the trailer.

179
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,520
但第二辆卡车不可能 在我们之前赶到
But no way a second truck got here before us.

180
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,440
不
No.

181
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,440
这是劫车
This is a hijacking.

182
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,730
有没有可能你是错的
Any chance you're wrong?

183
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,700
我没错 他们怎么知道我们是谁
I'm not wrong! How the fuck did they know who we are?

184
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,870
领班肯定给新时代打电话 说了两个政府检查员的事
Foreman must've called New Age about two government inspectors.

185
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,700
兰斯顿发现后给这些混蛋打了电话
Langston finds out and calls these dickheads.

186
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,420
什么鬼
The fuck?

187
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,150
我觉得我们干掉他了
I think we got him.

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,110
是啊
Yeah.

189
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,780
看来我们还打中了 一个前胎和一个油箱
Also looks like we got a front tire and gas tank.

190
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,580
- 我们离不开了 - 不 我去报警
- We're not getting out of here. - No. I'll call the cops.

191
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,120
匿名报警
Make it anonymous.

192
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
收到
Copy that. Do me a favor, grab the manifest.

193
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,630
帮我个忙 拿一下清单 我们需要把车牌取下来
We need the license plate off of it.

194
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,430
天啊
Oh, shit.

195
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,850
怎么了 内格利
What's up, Neagley?

196
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,400
其实有很多事
Hell of a lot, actually. We got to talk fast,

197
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,730
我们得说快点 因为警察 正在赶来统计尸体数量的路上
because cops are on the way to a body count and we got to put some distance between us

198
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,610
我们得拉开距离
and them.

199
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,030
有什么能证明你们在现场的东西吗
Anything to put you at the scene?

200
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,030
租的车
Rental car.

201
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,530
它被射穿了 是用迪克森的假身份证租的
It was shot to hell, but it was rented with Dixon's fake ID.

202
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,410
我们把它烧了 以免留下指纹和DNA
We torched it to get rid of prints and DNA.

203
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,540
很好 所以发生了什么
Good. So what happened out there?

204
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,330
你想听坏消息 还是更坏的消息
You want the bad news or the worse news?

205
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,250
让我们大吃一惊吧
Surprise us.

206
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,880
一辆新时代的卡车 连同其运载的650枚导弹全被劫持了
Well, a New Age truck with all 650 missiles in it was hijacked.

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,130
- 希望那是更坏的消息 - 恐怕不能如你所愿
I hope that's the worse news. You wish.

208
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,720
托尼斯旺还活着
Tony Swan's alive.

209
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,340
- 所以那是好消息啊 - 不是
- So that's a good thing. - No.

210
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,590
看起来斯旺还在替新时代做事
It looks like Swan's still working with New Age.

211
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,510
提货单上显示 是斯旺签字授权送货
According to the bill of lading, Swan personally signed off on the shipment

212
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,810
然后货物才离开工厂的
before it left the factory.

213
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,890
那他在丹佛
So he's in Denver?

214
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,060
文件上显示他是从纽约授权的
No, the paperwork said he authorized it from New York.

215
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,900
所以他们伪造了他的签名
So they forged his signature.

216
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,560
- 是数字指纹 - 那就是他们强迫了他
- It's a digital thumbprint. - Then they forced him.

217
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,110
新时代纽约分部的门上有虹膜扫描仪
New Age New York has iris scanners on the doors,

218
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,440
计算机是用的指纹锁
thumbprint locks on the computers.

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,820
任何人都无法强迫托尼斯旺
There's no way that anyone could force Tony Swan

220
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,410
通过复杂的生物识别技术 而不引起骚乱
through that maze of biometrics without causing a huge scene.

221
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,530
只有一个办法能让他们不担心骚乱
The only way they wouldn't worry about a ruckus

222
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,500
那就是让所有一千多名员工 全都参与此事
is if all thousand-plus employees were in on this thing,

223
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,540
但这么大规模的阴谋的几率...
and the odds of a conspiracy that vast are...

224
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,500
微乎其微
Minimal.

225
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,670
我知道你想相信斯旺是清白的 老大 我们都想相信
I know you want to believe Swan's clean, boss, we all do,

226
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,550
但就目前的情况看来不是这样 等我们安全了再聊 好吗
but things look the way they look. Talk when we're safe, okay?

227
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,220
雷彻
Reacher?

228
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
收到
Copy that.

229
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,730
你之前说要把他们都杀了
So what you said about killing them all...

230
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,270
那包括托尼斯旺吗
...that include Tony Swan?

231
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,690
我要去散步
I'm going for a walk.

232
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,580
你们不需要这些
You boys won't be needing these.

233
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,130
是啊 我们这儿都是朋友
Yeah, we're all friends here.

234
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
拿走了他们的枪
Took their guns.

235
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,220
只要他们找不到斯旺身上的窃听器
Long as they didn't find the wire Swan's wearing,

236
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,470
就一切安好
we're five by five.

237
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,890
就像那个恶棍说的
Like that miscreant said,

238
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,390
“我们这儿都是朋友”
"We're all friends here."

239
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,180
- 我们看看你有什么 美国兵 - 美国兵
Let's see what you got, G.I. Joe. G.I. Joe?

240
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,930
说山地大猩猩更贴切吧
More like Mighty Joe Young.

241
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,020
你想不想和这个大块头 挤在一个散兵坑里
How'd you like to be jammed into a foxhole with this giant motherfucker?

242
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,730
我们的价格比你们现在付的更优惠
We'll beat whatever price you're paying now.

243
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,110
我们的供应商可以从 无法谈判的海外源头
Our supplier can get you all the H you can move from an overseas source

244
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,150
给你们弄来 所有你们可以转运的海洛因
that's in no position to negotiate terms.

245
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,530
我们把省下来的钱都给你们
We pass the savings on to you.

246
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,590
好的
Okay.

247
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,590
我们来谈谈价钱
Let's talk money.

248
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,720
他们一达成协议 我们就出动
Soon as they agree to a deal, we go.

249
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,350
逮捕他们 逼迫他们 他们会说出他们的货源
Bust them, lean on them, they give up their source;

250
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,310
我们逮捕他们 然后全都能升职
we bust them, then we all get bumped.

251
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,720
胸前的绶带和奖章就更多了
More fruit salad on our chests...

252
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,890
薪水支票上还会有 更多美元标志哦 兄弟
More dollar signs on our paychecks, bro.

253
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,020
为什么要在我们的薪水支票上 加美元标志
Why would they add dollar signs to our paychecks?

254
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,190
闭嘴 弗朗茨
Shut up, Franzy.

255
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,570
这孩子说得有道理 曼努埃尔 一个美元标志就够了 重点是零
The kid's got a point, Manuel. You only need one dollar sign.

256
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,860
混蛋
Assholes.

257
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,570
小心 有人靠近
Heads up. We got incoming.

258
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,630
早该来了
About time.

259
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
110
110?

260
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,430
你之前说价格会优于我们目前的价格
You said you could beat our current price.

261
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,430
我给你们优惠了啊
I am beating it.

262
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,510
还不够
Not by enough.

263
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,770
你想让我们更换供应商 那就打动我们吧
You want us to change suppliers, motivate us.

264
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,770
鸡肉 我说的是猪肉
This is chicken. I said pork.

265
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,520
好吧 105怎么样
- You heard me order it. - Okay. Fucking idiots always get it wrong. How's 105?

266
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,320
听起来像是在浪费我的时间
Sounds like you're wasting my fucking time.

267
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,440
你还找得到这么纯卖105的吗
- You got forks? - You have another brick as pure as that for 105?

268
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,150
- 我见过更好的 - 胡说
Seen better. Bullshit.

269
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,860
我有一长串买家的名单
I got a list of other buyers a mile long.

270
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,660
- 我来找你是因为你的量... - 我认识你
- I came to you... - I know you.

271
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,580
- ...值得我花时间协商 - 你认错人了吧
...because you purchase at a volume, which makes it worthwhile. I don't think so.

272
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,540
没认错 我从哪儿认识你的来着
Yeah, I do. Where do I know you from?

273
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,540
糟了
Uh-oh.

274
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,040
等等 可能没什么
Hold on. Might be nothing.

275
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,920
- 不知道 - 我知道我们以前见过
- No idea. - Look, I have other offers coming in. - I know we've met before.

276
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,090
- 你能为我做什么  - 一百 要么接受 要么就算了
What can you do for me? 100. Take it or leave it.

277
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,550
你是前不久买我吉他的那个人
I got it. You're the guy I sold my guitar to a while back.

278
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,810
你把我跟其他人搞混了
You got me mixed up with somebody else.

279
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,680
克雷格列表网 兄弟
Craigslist, dude.

280
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,100
你买了我的原声吉他
You bought my acoustic.

281
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,440
我们是要吃饭叙旧 还是达成协议
We gonna eat and discuss old times or are we gonna make a deal?

282
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,780
你们这些混蛋不想要这些东西 我们有其他地方可以卖
You assholes don't want this stuff, we got other places we can sell it.

283
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,740
等等 这家伙买吉他的时候
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, when this guy bought it,

284
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,490
他穿着宪兵的制服
he was in an Army cop uniform.

285
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,630
上
Fuck. Go, go, go, go.

286
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,550
小心
Look out!

287
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,690
- 叫救护车  - 别开枪
- Call an ambulance! - Don't shoot!

288
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,070
我们有一名军官倒下了 需要医疗救援
We have an officer down. We need medical assistance.

289
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,150
- 子弹没打中你的心脏 - 但打碎了我的锁骨
The bullet missed your heart. But shattered my collarbone.

290
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,700
我有段时间弹不了吉他了
Not gonna be playing that guitar for a while.

291
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,660
塞翁失马
Every cloud...

292
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,320
去你的
Fuck you.

293
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,410
嘿 你不能招惹谁
Hey, who don't you mess with?

294
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,490
卡车驾驶员工会
The Teamsters?

295
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,710
我欠你一个人情
I owe you one.

296
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,480
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

297
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,360
政府牌照 政府制服 政府的车
Government plates, government suits, government rides.

298
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,610
没想到拉沃伊议员花了这么长时间
Surprised it took Senator Lavoy this long

299
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,070
才查出昨晚是谁动了他的走狗
to figure out who sweated his flunky last night.

300
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,070
参议员有个提议给你 上车
The senator has a proposition for you. Get in.

301
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,950
不
No.

302
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,780
为什么 雷彻先生
Why not, Mr. Reacher?

303
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,910
叫我雷彻
Just "Reacher."

304
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,330
好吧 雷彻 你为什么不上车
Fine, Reacher. Why won't you get in the car?

305
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,250
因为他语气不善
Because he didn't ask nicely.

306
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,170
好的
Okay.

307
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,210
哈特 那个神奇的词是什么
Hart, what's the magic word?

308
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,720
请你上车
Please get in the vehicle?

309
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,110
我在丹佛的人带着货物侥幸逃脱
My man in Denver barely got away with the merchandise.

310
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,280
我为了实现无缝交易 付出了额外的代价
I'm paying a premium for a seamless transaction,

311
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,410
而且目前为止 这已经算不上是无缝交易了
and so far this has been anything but seamless.

312
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,370
如果这些问题持续存在 那可能得调整价格了
If these problems persist, there may have to be a price adjustment.

313
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,660
斯旺先生的一些老朋友 给我们带来了麻烦
Some of Mr. Swan's old friends are causing us problems,

314
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,370
但没什么是我们处理不了的
but it's nothing we can't handle.

315
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,590
如果你想要商品 就得遵守交易
If you want the merchandise, you honor the deal.

316
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,170
做你答应做的事 而我也会如此
Do what you promised and I will.

317
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,170
好的
Okay.

318
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,880
很好
Good.

319
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,100
你现在在哪里
Where are you now?

320
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,350
我就在外面
I am just outside...

321
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,640
不 这不可能是真的吧 “弗伦奇利克”
Oh, no, t-this can't be right. "French Lick"?

322
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,810
他妈的美国人
Fucking Americans.

323
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,730
印第安纳州
Indiana.

324
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,940
好的 等你到达这里时 小翅膀的芯片
Okay. The Little Wing chips will be ready to install

325
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,700
会准备好安装在导弹里
in the missiles by the time you get here.

326
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,410
斯旺先生的同事们也会处理好的
And Mr. Swan's associates will be taken care of.

327
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,070
计划已经开始实施了
That plan's already in motion.

328
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,370
去他妈的英国佬
Fuck your king.

329
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,460
蠢货
Prick.

330
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,830
华盛顿特区史密森国家动物园

331
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,380
在灵长类动物展示区的后面
Backstage at the primate exhibit?

332
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,090
够夸张的
Dramatic.

333
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,470
我以为你们在大猩猩中间会很舒服
Thought you might feel comfortable among the gorillas.

334
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,730
雷彻先生 我是马尔科姆拉沃伊
Mr. Reacher, I'm Malcolm Lavoy.

335
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,520
- 他更喜欢你叫他“雷彻” - 不
- He prefers just "Reacher." - No.

336
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,230
他必须叫我“先生”
He has to call me "Mister."

337
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,110
雷彻先生 很抱歉 我让人用这种方式把你带过来
My apologies for the manner in which you were brought in here, Mr. Reacher.

338
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,860
我猜你使用这个地方 是因为这是华盛顿特区为数不多的
Assume you use this location 'cause it's one of the few spots in D.C.

339
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,910
你可以在没有人 监视或窥探的情况下见面的地方
where you can meet without prying eyes or surveillance bugs.

340
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,450
这就是为什么我任命 自己为动物园董事会成员
Mm-hmm. It's why I got myself appointed to the zoo's board.

341
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,790
我相信你认识我的立法主任 博伊德先生吧
Ah, I believe you know my legislative director, Mr. Boyd.

342
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,040
是的
Yeah,

343
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,830
就是他喜欢可卡因
he's the one who likes cocaine.

344
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,420
我知道发生了什么后
You know, when I found out what happened,

345
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
我联系了我在局里的一个朋友
I reached out to a friend of mine at the Bureau.

346
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,340
想象一下博伊德知道
Imagine Boyd's embarrassment when he learned

347
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,930
自己一开始把我们的秘密透露给了
that the people he revealed our secrets to

348
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,850
非联邦特工有多尴尬
weren't FBI agents in the first place.

349
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,060
监控录像显示你们进入了辖区
Security video showed you entering the precinct

350
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,980
面部识别软件 将你和一个军人的身份证相匹配
and facial recognition software matched you to a military ID.

351
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,150
杰克雷彻
Jack Reacher. No middle name.

352
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,030
没有中间名 西点军校出身 两枚银星
West Point, two Silver Stars,

353
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,070
一枚铜星 一枚紫心勋章等等
a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and so on.

354
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,200
放尊重点
Show some respect.

355
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,990
很多勋章啊 顺便说一句 我想感谢你的服役
That is quite a list, and I want to thank you for your service, by the way.

356
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,080
你退役后 像是从人间蒸发了一样
Seems like after you retired, you kind of fell off the face of the Earth.

357
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,380
除了几年前 在佐治亚州马格雷夫的一起事件
Except for this incident a couple years ago in Margrave, Georgia.

358
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,760
你被指控杀了自己的兄弟
Charged with the murder of your own brother.

359
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,220
你当然被无罪释放了
You were, of course, exonerated.

360
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,590
然后 乔之前一直在调查的
Then a massive counterfeiting operation

361
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,430
一个大规模伪造行动
that Joe had been investigating

362
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,470
实实在在地被烧毁了
literally and figuratively burned to the ground.

363
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,140
现在 官方的说辞是
Now, the official story was

364
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,020
那都是一个菜鸟警察 和一个外地退伍军人干的
that it was all the work of a rookie cop and an out-of-town veteran.

365
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,320
也就是在波士顿逮捕了 博伊德的这位外地退伍军人
The same out-of-town veteran that arrested Boyd here in Boston.

366
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,360
说重点吧 这里有股猴子屎的味道
Get to the point. Smells like monkey shit in here.

367
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,700
雷彻先生 我知道马格雷夫的事 是你做的
Well, I know it was you in Margrave, Mr. Reacher.

368
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,790
我希望针对我们目前的情况 你也能做同样的事
I want you to do the same thing for the situation we have here.

369
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,130
为什么
Why?

370
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,340
因为在波士顿 你暗示博伊德
Because in Boston, you insinuated to Boyd

371
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,340
军队和民用飞机 可能会因为小翅膀而陷入危险
that military and civilian aircraft could be in danger due to Little Wing.

372
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,840
现在 我只能假设那意味着
Now, I can only assume that means that terrorists

373
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,680
恐怖分子对这项技术很感兴趣
are interested in the tech,

374
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,010
正在努力获得它
working hard to obtain it.

375
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,980
一旦我们确认了你的身份 我们就深入调查
See, once we identified you, we looked into things deeper

376
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,810
我们知道你以前的小队又重组了
and we learned that your old unit's back together,

377
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,400
其中有些人死了
and some are dead.

378
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,690
别那么震惊 雷彻先生
Don't look so shocked, Mr. Reacher,

379
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,610
我是美国国会议员 我能把事情做好
I'm a U.S. congressman, I get things done.

380
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,950
我很震惊 是因为 美国国会议员居然还能做事
I'm shocked because a U.S. congressman got anything done.

381
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,660
我已经习惯了 人们的阴阳怪气 雷彻先生
I'm used to the slings and arrows, Mr. Reacher.

382
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,960
我的底线是想要这个武器的人
But bottom line, the people who want this weaponry

383
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,620
绝对不能被允许持有该武器
can never be allowed to have it.

384
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,590
因为如果有人知道你从一开始
Because if anyone knew you were involved in the shady dealings

385
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,090
就参与了创造小翅膀的不正当交易 你就会被起诉
that created Little Wing in the first place, you'd be indicted.

386
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,590
除掉坏人 让我干干净净的
Get rid of the bad guys, keep my hands clean.

387
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,220
在华盛顿 我们称之为双赢
In Washington, we call that a win-win.

388
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,180
我尽我所能 给予了我方捍卫民主所需的工具
I did what I did to give our side the tools they need to defend democracy.

389
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,730
我只是避免了繁文缛节 那些没什么用 只会拖延时间
I just avoided the typical red tape that does nothing but cause the delays

390
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,650
造成生命损失
that cost lives.

391
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,940
还在这个过程中中饱私囊
And lined your pockets in the process.

392
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,730
再次重申 这叫双赢
Again, win-win.

393
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,650
我不想让无辜群众因为这种武器而死
But I don't want innocent people to die because of it.

394
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,410
我是政客 不是怪物 雷彻先生
I'm a political animal, I'm not a monster, Mr. Reacher.

395
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,280
而且我不是请你帮忙
And I'm not asking for your help,

396
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,160
我是给你提供帮助
I'm offering you mine.

397
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
你也是那种喜欢把事情做好的人
You're the kind of man who likes to gets things done, too.

398
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,420
你在军队和马格雷夫的记录 证明了这一点
Your record in the military, and in Margrave, proves that.

399
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,960
你喜欢打乱计划
You like to upset the apple cart.

400
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,590
我准备给予你所需要的一切 协助你完成这项任务
Well, I'm prepared to give you whatever you need to aid you in that endeavor.

401
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,550
等你完工后
And when you're done,

402
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,930
没有人能证明你曾卷入过那些计划
no one will be able to prove that you were ever near those apples in the first place.

403
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,470
就把这些东西砸成碎片
Just smash this thing to bits.

404
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,020
把这些人全都一网打尽 不遗留任何人威胁他人生命
Leave no man left standing. No one left to endanger lives.

405
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,650
然后你就又可以消失了 没有人会继续找你
And then you can disappear again. No one will go looking for you.

406
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,860
我们是你的朋友
Or your friends.

407
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,600
怎么
Yeah?

408
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,640
嘿 不怎么快乐的巨人
Hey, Not-So-Jolly Green Giant.

409
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,970
你已经把那套衣服扔了吗
You throw away that suit yet?

410
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,480
没有 怎么了
No. Why?

411
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,230
验尸官终于归还了弗朗茨的尸体
Coroner finally released Franz's body.

412
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,400
葬礼在明天举行
Funeral's tomorrow.

413
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,110
我们得回纽约
We got to go back to New York.

414
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,490
葬礼

415
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,200
我让我的办公室做了一些零星的调查
Had my office make some discrete inquiries.

416
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
丹佛的警察发现了 被枪击的卡车和被掉包的拖车
Denver sheriffs found the shot-up truck with a switched-out trailer.

417
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,710
- 里面什么都没有 只有几块砖 - 它们完美匹配
Nothing in it but crates of bricks. Guessing they perfectly matched

418
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,880
发射器和导弹的重量
the weight of the launchers and the missiles.

419
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,260
是的 看来他们的计划 是开车将假的货物
Yep. It seems their plan was to drive the dummy cargo down

420
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,630
运送到洛杉矶港口
to the port in L.A.

421
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,680
然后送到菲律宾的军事基地
And ship it to an Army base

422
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,890
或者任何那武器应该去的地方
in the Philippines or wherever the weapons were supposed to go.

423
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,430
根据我们的资料显示 是韩国
South Korea, according to the documents we saw.

424
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,180
真聪明
Smart.

425
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,480
货船从西海岸到那里 需要三到四周的时间
Three to four weeks for a cargo ship to get there from the West Coast,

426
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,230
在另一边开箱前 没人知道武器失踪了
no one knows the weapons were missing till they open it up on the other end.

427
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,190
谁知道那要多长时间呢
And who knows how long that could be?

428
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,110
军队可能会直接将其放到仓库 几个月都不看它们
Army could just load it into storage and not see them again for months.

429
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,860
到那时 为时已晚
And by then, it's too late.

430
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,610
恐怖分子已经击落了数十架飞机
Terrorists have taken down dozens of planes

431
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,450
而我们还不知道 他们从哪儿弄来的武器
and we have no idea where they got the firepower.

432
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,070
说起武器
Speaking of firepower,

433
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,240
有任何关于真正的导弹的 去向的线索吗
we have any leads as to where the real missiles went?

434
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,960
科罗拉多州警方在丹佛外的 一块田里发现了那辆卡车 是空的
Colorado State Police found the truck in a field outside Denver. It was empty.

435
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,370
根据卡车在泥土里的痕迹来看
Based on the tracks in the dirt,

436
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,250
他们认为一架私人飞机 连夜把武器带走了
they think a private plane flew the weapons out overnight.

437
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,630
它可能会去往任何地方
Could be headed here.

438
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,010
自从911以后 纽约上空就一直受到了密切地监控
Since 9/11, they've kept a pretty close watch on New York's skies.

439
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,380
我们知道AM很谨慎
And we know A.M.'s cautious.

440
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,220
如果我是他
I were him,

441
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,600
我会把它们带到 宾夕法尼亚州的某个小机场里
I'd fly them into some small airstrip in Pennsylvania,

442
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,970
也可以是新罕布什尔州 再开车将武器运到纽约
maybe New Hampshire, then drive the weapons into New York

443
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,930
好给它们加上小翅膀软件
to load them up with the Little Wing software.

444
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,850
言之有理
That makes sense.

445
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,600
我们需要知道导弹 到底是在往哪儿运才能拦截它们
We need to know exactly where the missiles are headed so we can intercept them.

446
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,770
因为当钱易手时
'Cause when the money changes hands,

447
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,780
AM会到场 杀了我们的人的凶手也在
A.M. will be there, and so will the people who killed our guys.

448
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,530
雷彻 你看到那玩意了吗
Reacher. You seeing this shit?

449
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,710
那不是那天他车里的玩具吗
Isn't that that toy he had in his car the other day?

450
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,750
米奇 我的侄子也有一个
Mikey. My nephews have the same one.

451
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,880
这是个很棒的玩具 我们一直一起玩
It's a great toy. We play with it all the time.

452
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,430
我小时候 我有海王
When I was a kid, I had Aquaman.

453
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,430
我觉得他跟鱼说话的方式太酷了
I thought it was so cool how he could talk to fish.

454
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,980
因为我当时也想跟我的狗说话
'Cause I wanted to talk to my dog, you know?

455
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,860
嘿
Hey.

456
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,200
我也想把这张照片给你 这是我的
I want you to have this, too. This was mine.

457
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,370
圣杰罗姆
Saint Jerome.

458
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,200
他是爸爸或妈妈去了天堂的 孩子的守护神
He's the patron saint of kids whose moms and dads go to heaven.

459
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,210
我希望你每晚都念
I want you to say the prayer...

460
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,880
这照片后面的祈祷词
...on the back, every night.

461
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,630
它会让你爸离你近点
It'll help keep your dad close.

462
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,390
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

463
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,350
好孩子
Good boy.

464
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,730
好孩子
Good boy.

465
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,360
你有任何需要 就给我打电话
You need anything, you call me.

466
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,360
白天晚上都行
Day or night.

467
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,900
- 谢谢 - 没事
- Thank you. - Yeah.

468
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,240
来吧 米奇 葬礼要开始了
Come on, Mikey. They're just about to start.

469
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,750
你为什么要送玩具 给我死去的朋友的儿子
Why are you giving toys to my dead friend's son?

470
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
什么
Excuse me?

471
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,790
和孩子相处融洽 就能刷妈妈的好感度
Cozy up to the kid, score points with Mom.

472
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,840
你看到一个悲伤的寡妇 心想:“这个目标容易得手”
You see a grieving widow and think, "Easy target"?

473
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,050
你现在在跟我开玩笑吗  你是想找死吗
Are you kidding me right now? You got some kind of death wish?

474
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,600
有些人这么想
Some people think so.

475
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
我是来表达敬意的
I'm here to pay my respects.

476
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,600
为什么昨晚在波士顿 有一个摩托车团伙攻击我
Why did a biker gang take a run at me in Boston last night?

477
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,520
因为你是个混蛋
'Cause you're an asshole.

478
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,310
可能吧 也可能是因为 我们只把我们的行踪告诉了你
Possibly. Or maybe it's 'cause you're the only person I told  we were going there.

479
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,980
等等 你是想说我是黑警
Wait, wait, wait. Are you trying to say that I'm bent?

480
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,650
我什么都没想说
Not trying to say anything.

481
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,660
你知道我为什么跟米奇说话吗  因为我知道他在经历什么
You know why I was talking to Mikey? Because I know what he's going through.

482
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,280
我知道每晚看着窗户外面
I know what it is to look out the window every night

483
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,370
祈祷街上来的是自己父亲的车 是什么感觉
and pray that the next set of headlights coming down the street is your father's car,

484
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,710
即使你知道那永远不会发生
even though you know it'll never happen,

485
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,210
因为你亲眼看到 罗马诺殡仪馆的那些家伙
because you saw the guys from Romano's funeral home

486
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,130
在他的棺材上撒土
throw dirt on his casket.

487
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,300
你知道失去家人是什么感觉吗
Do you know what it is to lose family?

488
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,840
是啊 他们都死了 全都死了
Yeah, they're all dead. Every one of them.

489
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,590
而我在说你
And I was talking about you,

490
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,510
- 没说你爸 - 我在说他
not your father. I'm talking about him.

491
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,140
我爸曾是一名警察 一个好警察
My father was a cop, a good one,

492
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,310
他拒绝受贿 因此被人杀害
and he refused to be on the take and they killed him for it.

493
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,650
听着
Look,

494
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,730
我知道那是 你朋友的儿子和遗孀 我懂
I know that's your friend's son and widow. I get it.

495
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,900
但如果你再说我是黑警
But you call me dirty one more time,

496
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,200
我不在乎我们是否是站在圣母像面前
and I don't care if we're standing in front of the statue of the Holy Mother,

497
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,950
我会新账老账一起算 就在这里狠狠揍你一顿
I will give you that beating that I owe you right here.

498
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,870
第一 只要你想 我随时奉陪
One, I'll take that fight any time you want.

499
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,830
第二
And two...

500
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,420
我不知道你父亲的事
I didn't know that about your father.

501
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,920
是啊 你不知道的事可多了去了
Yeah, well, what you don't know could fill the Javits.

502
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,800
因为天知道你在波士顿做什么的时候
Because while you were in Boston doing God knows what,

503
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,090
我在忙着查新时代安保部的人
I was running those security names from New Age.

504
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,220
他们全都是前纽约市警察局的
All former NYPD,

505
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,800
全部来自第三分局
all from the 3rd precinct.

506
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,600
老板兰斯顿和其他几个人 都接受过内务部的调查
The boss, Langston and a few other guys, they were under investigation by IA.

507
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,730
他们提前退休了 那些指控就消失了
They took early retirement and the charges went away.

508
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,440
然后他们全都在新时代 找到了轻松的工作 雇佣了所有朋友
Then they all got cushy jobs at New Age, and they hired all their pals along.

509
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,070
整个团队全是黑警
Whole team of bad cops?

510
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,780
所有人 除了你的朋友 斯旺
Everybody except your buddy Swan.

511
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,150
但他是唯一一个有从军经历
But he's the only one that has military experience

512
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,320
知道恐怖分子 想要哪种武器的人 所以...
to know what type of weapons terrorists want, so...

513
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,450
现在你在含沙射影地说 会让我生气的事
Now you're implying something that's pissing me off.

514
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,410
你不能否认这种猜想是合理的
You can't deny he makes sense for this.

515
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,410
根据他的背景 这一切可能都是他主使的
With his background, for all we know, he might have put the whole thing together.

516
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,170
所有警察 全是黑警 都是一个辖区的
All cops, all bad, all from the same precinct.

517
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,630
- 你审问过他们中任何人吗  - 问不了
- You interview any of them? - Couldn't.

518
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,710
你在他们办公的地方砸出了一个大洞
You turned their office into a drive-through.

519
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,130
他们躲起来了
They went to the ground.

520
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,430
他们的住处空无一人 跟托尼斯旺的住处一样
Their places were empty, just like Tony Swan's.

521
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,640
你想骂某人是黑警  先查查你自己的后院吧
You want to call somebody dirty? First look in your own backyard.

522
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,780
因此 我们要将我们的兄弟 卡尔文弗朗茨埋葬
We therefore commit our brother Calvin Franz to the ground,

523
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,320
归于大地 尘归尘 土归土
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

524
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,370
让往生者安宁
in sure and certain hope of the resurrection

525
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,910
让在世者重获解脱 阿门
to the eternal life.

526
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,330
阿门
Amen.

527
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,820
鸣枪队 注意
Firing party, attention.

528
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,700
待命
Stand by.

529
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,910
准备
Ready.

530
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,540
瞄准
Aim.

531
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,670
开火
Fire.

532
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,460
准备
Ready.

533
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,760
瞄准 开火
Aim. Fire.

534
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,510
- 趴下  - 开火
- Get down! - Fire...

535
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,890
我保护你们 快 我们走
I got you. Come on. Let's go.

536
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,270
离开这里 快走
Get out of here. Go.

537
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,230
有人开枪 快跑
Active shooters! Run!

538
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,150
走

539
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,290
- 几个人  - 据我所知 两个
How many? As far as I can tell, two.

540
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,250
- 在路对面 - 手枪没用 得离近点
Across the road. Handguns are useless from this distance. We got to get closer.

541
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,460
包抄他们 内格利和我 负责右边的那个
Flank them. Neagley and I will take the one on the right.

542
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,250
你们俩负责左边那个 上
You two take the one on the left. Go.

543
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,240
我们尽可能接近 还不够
Close as we're gonna get. It's not enough.

544
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,780
可以等警察来
We could wait for the cops.

545
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,490
不能让他们跑了 他们一听到警笛就会散开
We can't let them get away. As soon as they hear sirens, they scatter.

546
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,540
好吧 我来吸引火力 你去干掉他们
All right. I'll draw their fire, you take them out.

547
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,250
- 我拒绝 - 你能做到
- Negative. - You can do this.

548
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,960
你射得很准
-You're a great shot.

549
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,130
但你跑得很慢
But you're a slow runner.

550
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,180
去你的
Fuck this.

551
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,850
糟了

552
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,750
上车
Get in!

553
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,430
你现在相信我了 还是饥不择食了
So, you trust me now, or are you just desperate?

554
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,890
我看见你保护安吉拉和米奇 所以我猜你说的是真的
I saw you protect Angela and Mikey, so I guess you're playing it square.

555
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,810
但你那儿有内鬼 那是肯定的
You got a rat in your house, though, that's for sure.

556
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,150
妈的 拉索 开快点
Shit, Russo, it's the pedal on the right.

557
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,110
让我做我的工作
Let me do my job.

558
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,790
抄近路
Cut the corner.

559
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,330
- 有路缘石 - 跳过去
- There's a curb. - Jump the curb!

560
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,500
你能别管我怎么开车吗
Will you climb out of my ass?

561
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,880
我以为这应该是高速追逐战
I thought this was supposed to be a high-speed pursuit.

562
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,060
- 我们最好的线索要被你搞丢了 - 你想来开车吗
You're losing our best lead. You want to drive?

563
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,520
好啊
Yes.

564
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,980
嘿
Hey, hey.

565
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,960
- 你真他妈是个祸害  - 你开车像个瞎子一样
You're a fucking menace, you know that? You drive like you're blind.

566
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,590
别开枪 我受够了 好吗 我受够了
Don't shoot. I'm done. Okay? I'm done.

567
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,640
- 你被捕了 混蛋 - 不
You're under arrest, asshole. No.

568
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,520
这些人在光天化日之下 攻击我们 还是在人多的葬礼上
These guys took a run at us in broad daylight at a crowded funeral.

569
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,560
他们越来越绝望了 这意味着这事快到紧要关头了
They're getting desperate. Means this thing's coming to a head fast.

570
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,440
我们拘留他 他会请律师 在为时已晚前缄口不言
We take him in, he lawyers up and doesn't talk until it's too late

571
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,280
恐怖分子有650次机会 击落一架商业客机
and a terrorist has 650 chances to take down a commercial airliner.

572
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,650
所以你想让我做什么
So, what do you want me to do?

573
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
看向另一边
Look the other way.

574
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,410
拜托 伙计
Oh, come on, man.

575
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,790
如果你不告诉我你知道的一切
By not telling me everything you know,

576
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,800
那就是在保护杀了我朋友的人
you're protecting the people who killed my friends.

577
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,010
我不会浪费时间 用那些审讯技巧
I'm not gonna waste my time with enhanced interrogation techniques.

578
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,840
我只会夺走你的生命
I'm just gonna squeeze the life out of you.

579
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,550
如果你在你死前 想完全卸下自己的负担
So, if at any point before you die you feel like fully unburdening yourself...

580
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:04,810
那就眨眼
blink.

581
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,820
- 现在说话 - 好的
- Talk, now. - Okay. Okay.

582
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,900
天啊 让我喘口气
Christ. Let me catch my breath.

583
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,790
我们本来应该利用21响礼炮的枪声
We were supposed to use the gunfire from the 21-gun salute

584
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,830
来掩盖我们的射击
to mask our shot.

585
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,290
干掉你和你的团队成员
Take you and your team down and get out of there

586
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,540
在任何人搞清楚状况前离开
before anyone knew what was going on.

587
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,500
对于专业枪手来说 赚这钱轻松容易
Easy payday for a couple professional hitters.

588
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,750
- 跟我说些我不知道的事 - 比如
- Tell me something I don't know. - Like what?

589
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,210
兰斯顿不会一开始就把所有钱都给你
Langston wouldn't give you all the cash up front.

590
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,670
你要在哪里见他拿尾款
Where are you supposed to meet him to get the rest of the money?

591
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,800
皇后区某个破烂街区的 一栋废弃建筑里
An abandoned building in some shitty neighborhood in Queens.

592
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,890
我可以带你们去
Look, I-I can take you there.

593
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,850
但我不认识兰斯顿
But I don't know any Langston.

594
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,810
那是谁雇的你
Then who hired you?

595
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,600
一个叫斯旺的家伙
Some guy called Swan.

596
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,700
收到
Copy that.

597
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,200
迪克森和奥唐纳已就位 拉索在街上
Dixon and O'Donnell are in position. Russo's down the street.

598
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,660
所有出口都已覆盖
All exits are covered.

599
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,660
听到了吗  你要是敢乱来 你会后悔的
Hear that? You try anything, you'll be sorry.

600
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,040
你进去拿钱 给我们这地方的信息
But you go in there, get paid, give us the rundown...

601
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,330
里面有多少人 他们带着什么武器
How many inside, what they're packing...

602
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,540
房间的布局 人都坐在哪里
Layout of the room, where everyone's sitting...

603
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,840
然后我们就放了你 你可以留着钱 懂了吗
We'll cut you loose and you get to keep the cash. Understood?

604
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,170
好的 随便吧
Yeah, man. Whatever.

605
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,260
我只希望永远都不会再见到你们
I just never want to see you people again.

606
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
把你的手机给我
Give me your phone.

607
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,150
把这个放在口袋里 这样我们就能监听
Keep this in your pocket so we can listen in.

608
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,780
你要是敢做小动作 我们会突然进攻 你就跟他们一起死吧
You try anything, we come in hot and you die with the rest of them.

609
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,650
去吧 蠢货
Get going, stupid.

610
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,210
我们在想什么
So, what are we thinking?

611
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,460
斯旺去新时代工作
Swan went to work for New Age,

612
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,840
看到了他一直梦寐以求的赚钱机会 然后就接受了
saw a chance to make the kind of money he always dreamed of and took it?

613
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,750
然后呢
Then what?

614
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,590
他跟弗朗茨一起出去玩 他们都在一个城市
He was hanging out with Franzy, them being in the same city and all,

615
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,380
不小心透露了什么 让弗朗茨产生了怀疑
slipped and said something that made Franz suspicious?

616
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,970
或者他试着拉弗朗茨入伙
Or... tried to get Franz in on it?

617
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,600
心想要养老婆和孩子 他也需要钱
Figured with a wife and kid, he'd need the money, too.

618

弗朗茨拒绝了

619
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,980
试图阻止 打电话给 桑切斯和奥罗斯科求助

那听起来对吗

621
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,240
我不知道 但如果斯旺真在那栋楼里
I don't know, but if Swan's really in that building,

622
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,530
我也会像对待那家伙一样对待斯旺
I'm gonna do the same thing I did to that guy.

623
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,910
用手掐住他的脖子 从他嘴里榨出真相
Wrap my hand around his neck and squeeze the truth out of him.

624
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,990
在那之后呢

625
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,420
你好
Hello?

626
