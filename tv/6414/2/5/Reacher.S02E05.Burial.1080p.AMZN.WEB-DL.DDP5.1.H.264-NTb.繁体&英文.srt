1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
《烈探雷徹》前情提要
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,050
不管你朋友卷入的是什么事 其金額都大到害死了他們
Well, whatever your friends were involved in was big enough to get them killed.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,970
我招募的托尼斯旺 絕對不可能參與此事
There's no way the Tony Swan I recruited is a part of this.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,550
看來斯旺的職位是安全總監助理
Seems Swan's title was assistant director of security.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,680
“謝恩蘭斯頓 安全總監”
"Shane Langston. Director of Security."

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,930
也許在大西洋城 跟我通話的就是這個人
Maybe he's the guy I got on the phone in Atlantic City.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,230
我們得跟馬爾科姆拉沃伊談談
We need to talk to Malcolm Lavoy.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,610
我們永遠沒法接近參議員 從他口中套話
We'll never get close enough to a senator to find out what he may or may not know.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,070
我們不需要接近他 丹尼爾博伊德 拉沃伊參議員的立法主任
Oh, we don't need to. Daniel Boyd, Senator Lavoy's legislative director.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,280
小翅膀可以擊中空中的任何物體
Little Wing can knock anything out of the sky.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
新時代有兩個基地
New Age has two bases.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,330
軟件是在紐約開發的 硬件是在丹佛的制造工廠制造的
Software made in New York, hardware at a manufacturing plant in Denver.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,540
我們的指令是什么
What are our directives?

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,870
你和迪克森去丹佛 奧唐納和我會去華盛頓特區
You and Dixon go to Denver. O'Donnell and I will head down to D.C.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,580
我想去國土安全局 看看他們是否知道AM的事
Want to swing by Homeland, see what they know about A.M.

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,830
給馬備好鞍
Saddle up...

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,340
因為我們要去做一大堆牛仔的事
...'cause we're about to do a whole lot of cowboy shit.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,340
再見

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,810
別鬧了
Quit it!

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,680
我會抓住你的
I'm gonna get you!

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,100
不 你抓不到的
No, you're not.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,690
別再丟我的泰迪熊了 否則我會...
Don't drop my teddy ever again or I will...

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,110
...你的臉
...at your face.

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,650
住手
Stop it!

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,110
你帶腎上腺素筆了嗎
You got the EpiPens?

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,410
- 當然帶了 - 伍比呢
- Yes, of course. - And woobie?

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,160
伍比毯 熊貓朋友 猴子林賽 全都裝好了
Woobie, Panda-pal, Lindsay the Monkey, they're all packed.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,870
帶上一次性手機 別跟任何人聯系 不要找你父母
Grab the burner phone. No contact with anyone. Not your parents,

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,370
而且千萬別聯系你姐姐 她什么都往臉書上發
and definitely not your sister. She puts everything on Facebook.

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,870
我知道這一套
I know the drill.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,920
去阿什維爾 帶男孩們過去 那里有很多事做
Go to Asheville. Take the boys. Plenty for you to do there.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,340
那是旅游勝地 你會融入其中
It's touristy. You'll blend in.

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,760
用現金和現收現付信用卡
Use cash and this pay-as-you-go credit card.

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,590
按從一到十打分 情況有多糟
Scale of one to ten, how bad is this?

35
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,130
他們不會去找你們的
They're not gonna come after you.

36
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,680
我們只是謹慎行事 額外小心
We're just playing it safe. Belts and suspenders.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
按從一到十打分
One to ten.

38
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,770
對于你們來說 最多四分
For you guys? Four, tops.

39
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,350
那你呢
How about you?

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,730
我們正在處理一些相當壞的家伙
Well, we're dealing with some pretty bad guys, but...

41
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,070
但我有朋友在身邊 我們會沒事的
I got the gang with me. We'll be fine.

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,480
過幾天就結束了
It'll be over in a couple of days, promise.

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,940
我得讓孩子做好準備
I got to get the baby ready.

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,820
就像上次一樣

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,570
把我的泰迪熊還給我
Give my tie back!

46
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,830
我需要你們去...
I need...

47
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,990
她并不驚慌
She doesn't panic.

48
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,200
...去挑你們的衣服

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
既來之 則安之
Accepts reality on reality's terms.

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,960
她是急診室護士 和芝加哥消防隊長的女兒
Daughter of an ER nurse, Chicago fire chief.

51
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,170
非常堅強
Tough as they come.

52
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,210
漂亮 堅強 聰明
Beautiful, tough, smart.

53
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,420
她打賭輸了才嫁給你的
She lose a bet?

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,840
這就是我在做的
...dinner. That's what I'm making.

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,970
如果當初有人問我 你的結局會是怎樣
If someone asked me back in the day where I thought you'd wind up,

56
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,930
我會預測你因為淋病慢慢死去
I'd have predicted a slow death from gonorrhea

57
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,600
還會有六個女朋友 為了一輛04年的馬自達大打出手
and a half dozen girlfriends fighting over an '04 Miata.

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,190
是啊 原來我并不想要 世界上的每一個女孩
Yeah, well, turns out I didn't want every girl in the world,

59
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,230
只想要對的那個
just the right one.

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,070
你想稍微冷靜一下嗎

61
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,190
內格利和迪克森剛到丹佛的工廠
Neagley and Dixon just got to the Denver plant.

62
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,200
很好 她們也許能拿到那些導彈
Good. Maybe they get ahold of those missiles

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,990
你的家人就不必離開太久
and your family won't have to be gone long.

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,620
你真慢
You're a slowpoke.

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,620
好的
Okay.

66
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,840
離開幾天沒關系
A few days wouldn't hurt.

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,760
我會的
I will.

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
科羅拉多州丹佛

69
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,060
國防合約管理局一個月前來過這里
The DCMA was here a month ago.

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,970
是啊 現在我們又回來了
Yeah, and now we're back.

71
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,940
我們可是政府監管的“皰疹” 總是神出鬼沒
We're the cold sores of government oversight.

72
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,100
現在 請把你們的領班叫來
Now, if you please? Your foreman?

73
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,730
新時代科技 配送倉庫

74
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,690
在這里等著
Wait here.

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,820
真是讓我驚嘆不已 你拿著寫字板 表現自然
Never ceases to amaze me how far you can get into a place

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,580
就好像你就應該在那兒一樣
if you just act like you're supposed to be there and carry a clipboard.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
你覺得怎么樣
How you feeling?

78
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,580
疼
Sore.

79
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,670
穿著高跟鞋打架 是需要一段時間適應的
Well, fighting in heels takes some getting used to.

80
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,760
穿高跟鞋走路 也需要一段時間適應 我從來沒穿過
Walking in heels takes some getting used to. Never wore 'em.

81
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,630
你之前從來不穿高跟鞋
You never wore heels?

82
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,930
不穿
Nope.

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,680
連學校舞會上都不穿
Not even to a school dance?

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,100
從沒去過
Never went to one.

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,390
我不學習 或者不照顧我爸的時候 我得去工作
When I wasn't studying or taking care of my dad, I had to work.

86
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,150
也就是糟糕的音樂 溫暖的酒水 以及一些摸著你的黏糊糊的手
Well, bad music, warm punch and some clammy hands feeling you up...

87
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,730
你并沒有錯過太多
you didn't miss much.

88
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,280
沒人跟我說你們要來檢查
Nobody told me about this.

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,580
如果我們提前通知就不是突擊檢查了
Wouldn't be a surprise inspection if we called ahead.

90
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,620
山姆大叔想確定 你們把錢用在了正道上
Uncle Sam wants to make sure you're using his money wisely.

91
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,170
所以我們來看看小翅膀肩扛式發射器
So we're here to take a look at Little Wing shoulder-fired launchers and missiles.

92
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,710
以及導彈 檢查它們的規格和制造協議
The specs, the manufacturing protocols,

93
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,670
訂單以及交貨時間表
the order and delivery schedules...

94
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,210
交貨時間表
Delivery schedule?

95
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,470
交貨時間就在十分鐘前
Ten minutes ago. That's the delivery schedule.

96
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,970
所有貨物剛運出去
The whole lot just went out the door.

97
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,470
總共650個
All 650 of them.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,020
650
650?

99
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,270
這是相關文件
Here's the paperwork.

100
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,230
如果有人先給我打電話 我本可以推遲交貨 給你們留著
If someone had called me first, I'd have held them for you.

101
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,190
- 糟了 - 是啊
- Shit. - Yeah.

102
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,180
嘿
Hey, there.

103
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,400
你需要幫忙嗎
You need an extra set of hands?

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,350
我需要的
What I need

105
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,940
是你的卡車
is your truck.

106
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,220
爆炸槍彈

107
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,690
一切按計劃進行中
We're in business.

108
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,280
匿名來電

109
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,080
告訴我好消息吧
Give me good news.

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,790
GPS追蹤器完成了其使命 你在新時代的同事們還不錯
GPS tracker did the job. Your associates at New Age came through.

111
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,290
但是我殺了司機 他們可能會傷心
They might be upset I killed the driver, though.

112
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,800
只要他們能拿到錢就不會在意
Oh, they won't care so long as they get paid.

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,590
永遠不要低估貪婪的力量
Never underestimate the power of greed.

114
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,380
- 換車上路吧 - 好的
Switch the trailers and get on the road. Will do.

115
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,800
我們紐約見
Meet you in New York.

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,470
阿扎里馬哈茂德

117
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,480
這里這個名字
This name, right here...

118
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,810
阿扎里馬哈茂德
...Azhari Mahmoud.

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,570
所以我們在丹佛 追捕的那個阿倫米克洛斯
So, the Aaron Miklos we were chasing down in Denver,

120
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,980
就是馬哈茂德
that was Mahmoud?

121
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,860
是的 我們一直叫他“AM”
Yeah, we've been calling him "A.M."

122
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,120
這家伙很聰明 從未被捕 也沒有照片
Guy's smart. Never been caught, no photos.

123
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,830
我們甚至都不確定他的國籍
Hell, we're not even sure what nationality he is.

124
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,160
從我們對他僅有的了解來看
From the little bit we know of him,

125
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,580
他可以偽裝成中美洲人
he can supposedly pass for Central American,

126
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,540
意大利人 希臘人 中東人...
Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern.

127
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
他如幽靈一般
He's a ghost.

128
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,800
我們有三段他的 簡短且無關痛癢的錄音
We have three short, innocuous recordings of him.

129
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,670
音頻鑒定部證實是同一個人
Audio forensics matched it as the same guy.

130
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,720
他每次都會使用不同的身份
Each time, he's using a different identity.

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,680
意識形態呢
Ideology?

132
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,600
沒有政治或宗教背景
No political or religious affiliations.

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,850
對他而言 唯有金錢才是上帝 他為出價最高的人工作
His only god is money, and he works for the highest bidder.

134
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,190
他會接洽壞人 為他們提供做壞事所需的工具
He hooks up bad actors with the tools they need for bad actions.

135
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,310
他在六年前第一次 出現在我們的視線中
First popped up on our radar six years ago.

136
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,690
在恐怖分子試圖 獲取實驗神經毒氣罐的時候
Terrorist cell caught trying to acquire tanks of experimental nerve gas.

137
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,030
我們逮捕了整個團隊
We scooped up the whole lot.

138
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,820
所有人 除了馬哈茂德
All of them except Mahmoud.

139
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,700
不管他叫什么
Or whatever his name is.

140
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,490
幽靈
Ghost.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
這次購買本來應該用無記名債券
This buy was supposed to happen with bearer bonds.

142
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,960
是的 逃稅者 洗錢者 和其他各種混蛋的
Yeah, financial instrument of choice for tax evaders,

143
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,130
首選金融工具
money launderers and other assorted assholes.

144
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,380
美國財政部在80年代 就停止發行這些債券了
The U.S. Treasury stopped issuing those in the '80s.

145
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,180
有些國家仍在使用 那些是盧森堡的
Some countries still use them. Those were from Luxembourg.

146
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,470
像AM這么謹慎的人 會使用無記名債券
Someone as cautious as A.M. would use bearer bonds.

147
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,890
如果發行量足夠大
If issued in large enough amounts,

148
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,270
你可以用公文包 攜帶一筆無法追蹤的財富
you can carry an untraceable fortune in a briefcase.

149
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,770
價值六千五百萬
65 million worth.

150
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,980
那就是問題所在
That's the problem.

151
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,600
你帶著一張無記名債券 就像帶著一百萬美元的鈔票
You hold a bearer bond, that's like carrying a million dollar bill.

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,810
它歸持有者所有
The bearer owns it.

153
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,570
所以AM不可能 讓除他以外的任何人運送酬勞
So no way A.M. lets anyone deliver payment but him.

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,650
這就是他的弱點
That's where he's vulnerable.

155
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
就像你哥哥一樣
Just like your brother.

156
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,660
當年我們辦案的時候 我問了喬
Back when we worked the case, I asked Joe

157
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,490
一些財務方面的問題
some questions of the financial side of things.

158
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,580
他也是你這么說的
He said same thing you just did.

159
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,920
運送酬勞的會是AM 不會是其他人
A.M. will be the delivery boy. No one else.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,630
好的 我們給你們 看了我們掌握的信息
Okay. We showed you ours.

161
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,670
現在輪到你們了
Now it's your turn.

162
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,640
我們還在整理中
We're still piecing it together, but, uh...

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,390
但我們向你們保證 等時機成熟
we give you our word, when this bird's cooked,

164
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,600
- 我們會聯系你們 - 我保證
- we'll reach out. - And you have my word

165
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,230
我們不會再讓這家伙 逃出我們的手掌心
we won't let this guy slip through our fingers again.

166
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,770
AM和他的所有同伙
A.M. and everyone working with him

167
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,440
都將受到法律的最大制裁
will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

168
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,860
除非我們先把他們都殺了
Unless we kill them all first.

169
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,540
謝謝你們
Thanks, guys.

170
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,090
跟他哥哥一樣
Just like his brother.

171
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,970
烈探雷徹
第二季第五集

172
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,970
本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

173
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,620
18輪車在這路上開不快的
18-wheelers can't go that fast on these roads.

174
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,120
我們有機會趕上他們
We've got a decent shot at catching them.

175
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,960
是啊 尤其是他們中途停車了
Yeah, especially if they come to a stop.

176
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,090
這些人是誰
Who are these guys?

177
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,640
會告訴我們卡車壞了的人
They're the guys who are gonna tell us the truck broke down

178
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,730
而且他們不得不 打電話叫另一個人來取車
and they had to call another one to come pick up the trailer.

179
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,520
但第二輛卡車不可能 在我們之前趕到
But no way a second truck got here before us.

180
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,440
不
No.

181
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,440
這是劫車
This is a hijacking.

182
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,730
有沒有可能你是錯的
Any chance you're wrong?

183
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,700
我沒錯 他們怎么知道我們是誰
I'm not wrong! How the fuck did they know who we are?

184
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,870
領班肯定給新時代打電話 說了兩個政府檢查員的事
Foreman must've called New Age about two government inspectors.

185
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,700
蘭斯頓發現后給這些混蛋打了電話
Langston finds out and calls these dickheads.

186
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,420
什么鬼
The fuck?

187
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,150
我覺得我們干掉他了
I think we got him.

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,110
是啊
Yeah.

189
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,780
看來我們還打中了 一個前胎和一個油箱
Also looks like we got a front tire and gas tank.

190
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,580
- 我們離不開了 - 不 我去報警
- We're not getting out of here. - No. I'll call the cops.

191
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,120
匿名報警
Make it anonymous.

192
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
收到
Copy that.

193
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,630
幫我個忙 拿一下清單 我們需要把車牌取下來
Do me a favor, grab the manifest. We need the license plate off of it.

194
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,430
天啊
Oh, shit.

195
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,850
怎么了 內格利
What's up, Neagley?

196
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,400
其實有很多事
Hell of a lot, actually.

197
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,730
我們得說快點 因為警察 正在趕來統計尸體數量的路上
We got to talk fast, because cops are on the way to a body count

198
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,610
我們得拉開距離
and we got to put some distance between us and them.

199
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,030
有什么能證明你們在現場的東西嗎
Anything to put you at the scene?

200
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,030
租的車
Rental car.

201
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,530
它被射穿了 是用迪克森的假身份證租的
It was shot to hell, but it was rented with Dixon's fake ID.

202
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,410
我們把它燒了 以免留下指紋和DNA
We torched it to get rid of prints and DNA.

203
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,540
很好 所以發生了什么
Good. So what happened out there?

204
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,330
你想聽壞消息 還是更壞的消息
You want the bad news or the worse news?

205
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,250
讓我們大吃一驚吧
Surprise us.

206
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,880
一輛新時代的卡車 連同其運載的650枚導彈全被劫持了
Well, a New Age truck with all 650 missiles in it was hijacked.

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,130
- 希望那是更壞的消息 - 恐怕不能如你所愿
I hope that's the worse news. You wish.

208
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,720
托尼斯旺還活著
Tony Swan's alive.

209
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,340
- 所以那是好消息啊 - 不是
- So that's a good thing. - No.

210
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,590
看起來斯旺還在替新時代做事
It looks like Swan's still working with New Age.

211
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,510
提貨單上顯示 是斯旺簽字授權送貨
According to the bill of lading, Swan personally signed off on the shipment

212
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,810
然后貨物才離開工廠的
before it left the factory.

213
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,890
那他在丹佛
So he's in Denver?

214
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,060
文件上顯示他是從紐約授權的
No, the paperwork said he authorized it from New York.

215
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,900
所以他們偽造了他的簽名
So they forged his signature.

216
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,560
- 是數字指紋 - 那就是他們強迫了他
- It's a digital thumbprint. - Then they forced him.

217
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,110
新時代紐約分部的門上有虹膜掃描儀
New Age New York has iris scanners on the doors,

218
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,440
計算機是用的指紋鎖
thumbprint locks on the computers.

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,820
任何人都無法強迫托尼斯旺
There's no way that anyone could force Tony Swan

220
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,410
通過復雜的生物識別技術 而不引起騷亂
through that maze of biometrics without causing a huge scene.

221
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,530
只有一個辦法能讓他們不擔心騷亂
The only way they wouldn't worry about a ruckus

222
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,500
那就是讓所有一千多名員工 全都參與此事
is if all thousand-plus employees were in on this thing,

223
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,540
但這么大規模的陰謀的幾率...
and the odds of a conspiracy that vast are...

224
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,500
微乎其微
Minimal.

225
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,670
我知道你想相信斯旺是清白的 老大 我們都想相信
I know you want to believe Swan's clean, boss, we all do,

226
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,550
但就目前的情況看來不是這樣 等我們安全了再聊 好嗎
but things look the way they look. Talk when we're safe, okay?

227
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,220
雷徹
Reacher?

228
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
收到
Copy that.

229
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,730
你之前說要把他們都殺了
So what you said about killing them all...

230
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,270
那包括托尼斯旺嗎
...that include Tony Swan?

231
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,690
我要去散步
I'm going for a walk.

232
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,580
你們不需要這些
You boys won't be needing these.

233
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,130
是啊 我們這兒都是朋友
Yeah, we're all friends here.

234
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
拿走了他們的槍
Took their guns.

235
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,220
只要他們找不到斯旺身上的竊聽器
Long as they didn't find the wire Swan's wearing,

236
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,470
就一切安好
we're five by five.

237
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,890
就像那個惡棍說的
Like that miscreant said,

238
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,390
“我們這兒都是朋友”
"We're all friends here."

239
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,180
- 我們看看你有什么 美國兵 - 美國兵
Let's see what you got, G.I. Joe. G.I. Joe?

240
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,930
說山地大猩猩更貼切吧
More like Mighty Joe Young.

241
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,020
你想不想和這個大塊頭 擠在一個散兵坑里
How'd you like to be jammed into a foxhole with this giant motherfucker?

242
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,730
我們的價格比你們現在付的更優惠
We'll beat whatever price you're paying now.

243
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,110
我們的供應商可以從 無法談判的海外源頭
Our supplier can get you all the H you can move from an overseas source

244
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,150
給你們弄來 所有你們可以轉運的海洛因
that's in no position to negotiate terms.

245
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,530
我們把省下來的錢都給你們
We pass the savings on to you.

246
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,590
好的
Okay.

247
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,590
我們來談談價錢
Let's talk money.

248
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,720
他們一達成協議 我們就出動
Soon as they agree to a deal, we go.

249
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,350
逮捕他們 逼迫他們 他們會說出他們的貨源
Bust them, lean on them, they give up their source;

250
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,310
我們逮捕他們 然后全都能升職
we bust them, then we all get bumped.

251
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,720
胸前的綬帶和獎章就更多了
More fruit salad on our chests...

252
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,890
薪水支票上還會有 更多美元標志哦 兄弟
More dollar signs on our paychecks, bro.

253
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,020
為什么要在我們的薪水支票上 加美元標志
Why would they add dollar signs to our paychecks?

254
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,190
閉嘴 弗朗茨
Shut up, Franzy.

255
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,570
這孩子說得有道理 曼努埃爾 一個美元標志就夠了 重點是零
The kid's got a point, Manuel. You only need one dollar sign.

256
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,860
混蛋
Assholes.

257
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,570
小心 有人靠近
Heads up. We got incoming.

258
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,630
早該來了
About time.

259
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
110
110?

260
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,430
你之前說價格會優于我們目前的價格
You said you could beat our current price.

261
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,430
我給你們優惠了啊
I am beating it.

262
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,510
還不夠
Not by enough.

263
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,770
你想讓我們更換供應商 那就打動我們吧
You want us to change suppliers, motivate us.

264
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,770
雞肉 我說的是豬肉
This is chicken. I said pork.

265
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,520
好吧 105怎么樣
Okay. Fucking idiots always get it wrong. How's 105?

266
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,320
聽起來像是在浪費我的時間
Sounds like you're wasting my fucking time.

267
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,440
你還找得到這么純賣105的嗎
- You got forks? - You have another brick as pure as that for 105?

268
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,150
- 我見過更好的 - 胡說
Seen better. Bullshit.

269
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,860
我有一長串買家的名單
I got a list of other buyers a mile long.

270
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,660
- 我來找你是因為你的量... - 我認識你
- I came to you... - I know you.

271
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,580
- ...值得我花時間協商 - 你認錯人了吧
...because you purchase at a volume, which makes it worthwhile. I don't think so.

272
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,540
沒認錯 我從哪兒認識你的來著
Yeah, I do. Where do I know you from?

273
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,540
糟了
Uh-oh.

274
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,040
等等 可能沒什么
Hold on. Might be nothing.

275
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,920
- 不知道 - 我知道我們以前見過
- No idea. - Look, I have other offers coming in. - I know we've met before.

276
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,090
- 你能為我做什么  - 一百 要么接受 要么就算了
What can you do for me? 100. Take it or leave it.

277
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,550
你是前不久買我吉他的那個人
I got it. You're the guy I sold my guitar to a while back.

278
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,810
你把我跟其他人搞混了
You got me mixed up with somebody else.

279
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,680
克雷格列表網 兄弟
Craigslist, dude.

280
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,100
你買了我的原聲吉他
You bought my acoustic.

281
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,440
我們是要吃飯敘舊 還是達成協議
We gonna eat and discuss old times or are we gonna make a deal?

282
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,780
你們這些混蛋不想要這些東西 我們有其他地方可以賣
You assholes don't want this stuff, we got other places we can sell it.

283
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,740
等等 這家伙買吉他的時候
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, when this guy bought it,

284
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,490
他穿著憲兵的制服
he was in an Army cop uniform.

285
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,630
上
Fuck. Go, go, go, go.

286
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,550
小心
Look out!

287
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,690
- 叫救護車  - 別開槍
- Call an ambulance! - Don't shoot!

288
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,070
我們有一名軍官倒下了 需要醫療救援
We have an officer down. We need medical assistance.

289
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,150
- 子彈沒打中你的心臟 - 但打碎了我的鎖骨
The bullet missed your heart. But shattered my collarbone.

290
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,700
我有段時間彈不了吉他了
Not gonna be playing that guitar for a while.

291
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,660
塞翁失馬
Every cloud...

292
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,320
去你的
Fuck you.

293
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,410
嘿 你不能招惹誰
Hey, who don't you mess with?

294
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,490
卡車駕駛員工會
The Teamsters?

295
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,710
我欠你一個人情
I owe you one.

296
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,480
讓我猜猜
Let me guess.

297
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,360
政府牌照 政府制服 政府的車
Government plates, government suits, government rides.

298
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,610
沒想到拉沃伊議員花了這么長時間
Surprised it took Senator Lavoy this long

299
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,070
才查出昨晚是誰動了他的走狗
to figure out who sweated his flunky last night.

300
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,070
參議員有個提議給你 上車
The senator has a proposition for you. Get in.

301
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,950
不
No.

302
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,780
為什么 雷徹先生
Why not, Mr. Reacher?

303
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,910
叫我雷徹
Just "Reacher."

304
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,330
好吧 雷徹 你為什么不上車
Fine, Reacher. Why won't you get in the car?

305
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,250
因為他語氣不善
Because he didn't ask nicely.

306
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,170
好的
Okay.

307
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,210
哈特 那個神奇的詞是什么
Hart, what's the magic word?

308
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,720
請你上車
Please get in the vehicle?

309
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,110
我在丹佛的人帶著貨物僥幸逃脫
My man in Denver barely got away with the merchandise.

310
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,280
我為了實現無縫交易 付出了額外的代價
I'm paying a premium for a seamless transaction,

311
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,410
而且目前為止 這已經算不上是無縫交易了
and so far this has been anything but seamless.

312
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,370
如果這些問題持續存在 那可能得調整價格了
If these problems persist, there may have to be a price adjustment.

313
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,660
斯旺先生的一些老朋友 給我們帶來了麻煩
Some of Mr. Swan's old friends are causing us problems,

314
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,370
但沒什么是我們處理不了的
but it's nothing we can't handle.

315
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,590
如果你想要商品 就得遵守交易
If you want the merchandise, you honor the deal.

316
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,170
做你答應做的事 而我也會如此
Do what you promised and I will.

317
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,170
好的
Okay.

318
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,880
很好
Good.

319
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,100
你現在在哪里
Where are you now?

320
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,350
我就在外面
I am just outside...

321
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,640
不 這不可能是真的吧 “弗倫奇利克”
Oh, no, t-this can't be right. "French Lick"?

322
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,810
他媽的美國人
Fucking Americans.

323
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,730
印第安納州
Indiana.

324
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,940
好的 等你到達這里時 小翅膀的芯片
Okay. The Little Wing chips will be ready to install

325
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,700
會準備好安裝在導彈里
in the missiles by the time you get here.

326
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,410
斯旺先生的同事們也會處理好的
And Mr. Swan's associates will be taken care of.

327
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,070
計劃已經開始實施了
That plan's already in motion.

328
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,370
去他媽的英國佬
Fuck your king.

329
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,460
蠢貨
Prick.

330
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,830
華盛頓特區史密森國家動物園

331
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,380
在靈長類動物展示區的后面
Backstage at the primate exhibit?

332
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,090
夠夸張的
Dramatic.

333
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,470
我以為你們在大猩猩中間會很舒服
Thought you might feel comfortable among the gorillas.

334
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,730
雷徹先生 我是馬爾科姆拉沃伊
Mr. Reacher, I'm Malcolm Lavoy.

335
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,520
- 他更喜歡你叫他“雷徹” - 不
- He prefers just "Reacher." - No.

336
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,230
他必須叫我“先生”
He has to call me "Mister."

337
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,110
雷徹先生 很抱歉 我讓人用這種方式把你帶過來
My apologies for the manner in which you were brought in here, Mr. Reacher.

338
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,860
我猜你使用這個地方 是因為這是華盛頓特區為數不多的
Assume you use this location 'cause it's one of the few spots in D.C.

339
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,910
你可以在沒有人 監視或窺探的情況下見面的地方
where you can meet without prying eyes or surveillance bugs.

340
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,450
這就是為什么我任命 自己為動物園董事會成員
Mm-hmm. It's why I got myself appointed to the zoo's board.

341
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,790
我相信你認識我的立法主任 博伊德先生吧
Ah, I believe you know my legislative director, Mr. Boyd.

342
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,040
是的
Yeah,

343
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,830
就是他喜歡可卡因
he's the one who likes cocaine.

344
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,420
我知道發生了什么后
You know, when I found out what happened,

345
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
我聯系了我在局里的一個朋友
I reached out to a friend of mine at the Bureau.

346
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,340
想象一下博伊德知道
Imagine Boyd's embarrassment when he learned

347
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,930
自己一開始把我們的秘密透露給了
that the people he revealed our secrets to

348
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,850
非聯邦特工有多尷尬
weren't FBI agents in the first place.

349
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,060
監控錄像顯示你們進入了轄區
Security video showed you entering the precinct

350
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,980
面部識別軟件 將你和一個軍人的身份證相匹配
and facial recognition software matched you to a military ID.

351
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,150
杰克雷徹
Jack Reacher.

352
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,030
沒有中間名 西點軍校出身 兩枚銀星
No middle name. West Point, two Silver Stars,

353
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,070
一枚銅星 一枚紫心勛章等等
a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and so on.

354
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,200
放尊重點
Show some respect.

355
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,990
很多勛章啊 順便說一句 我想感謝你的服役
That is quite a list, and I want to thank you for your service, by the way.

356
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,080
你退役后 像是從人間蒸發了一樣
Seems like after you retired, you kind of fell off the face of the Earth.

357
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,380
除了幾年前 在佐治亞州馬格雷夫的一起事件
Except for this incident a couple years ago in Margrave, Georgia.

358
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,760
你被指控殺了自己的兄弟
Charged with the murder of your own brother.

359
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,220
你當然被無罪釋放了
You were, of course, exonerated.

360
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,590
然后 喬之前一直在調查的
Then a massive counterfeiting operation

361
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,430
一個大規模偽造行動
that Joe had been investigating

362
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,470
實實在在地被燒毀了
literally and figuratively burned to the ground.

363
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,140
現在 官方的說辭是
Now, the official story was

364
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,020
那都是一個菜鳥警察 和一個外地退伍軍人干的
that it was all the work of a rookie cop and an out-of-town veteran.

365
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,320
也就是在波士頓逮捕了 博伊德的這位外地退伍軍人
The same out-of-town veteran that arrested Boyd here in Boston.

366
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,360
說重點吧 這里有股猴子屎的味道
Get to the point. Smells like monkey shit in here.

367
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,700
雷徹先生 我知道馬格雷夫的事 是你做的
Well, I know it was you in Margrave, Mr. Reacher.

368
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,790
我希望針對我們目前的情況 你也能做同樣的事
I want you to do the same thing for the situation we have here.

369
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,130
為什么
Why?

370
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,340
因為在波士頓 你暗示博伊德
Because in Boston, you insinuated to Boyd

371
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,340
軍隊和民用飛機 可能會因為小翅膀而陷入危險
that military and civilian aircraft could be in danger due to Little Wing.

372
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,840
現在 我只能假設那意味著
Now, I can only assume that means that terrorists

373
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,680
恐怖分子對這項技術很感興趣
are interested in the tech,

374
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,010
正在努力獲得它
working hard to obtain it.

375
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,980
一旦我們確認了你的身份 我們就深入調查
See, once we identified you, we looked into things deeper

376
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,810
我們知道你以前的小隊又重組了
and we learned that your old unit's back together,

377
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,400
其中有些人死了
and some are dead.

378
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,690
別那么震驚 雷徹先生
Don't look so shocked, Mr. Reacher,

379
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,610
我是美國國會議員 我能把事情做好
I'm a U.S. congressman, I get things done.

380
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,950
我很震驚 是因為 美國國會議員居然還能做事
I'm shocked because a U.S. congressman got anything done.

381
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,660
我已經習慣了 人們的陰陽怪氣 雷徹先生
I'm used to the slings and arrows, Mr. Reacher.

382
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,960
我的底線是想要這個武器的人
But bottom line, the people who want this weaponry

383
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,620
絕對不能被允許持有該武器
can never be allowed to have it.

384
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,590
因為如果有人知道你從一開始
Because if anyone knew you were involved in the shady dealings

385
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,090
就參與了創造小翅膀的不正當交易 你就會被起訴
that created Little Wing in the first place, you'd be indicted.

386
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,590
除掉壞人 讓我干干凈凈的
Get rid of the bad guys, keep my hands clean.

387
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,220
在華盛頓 我們稱之為雙贏
In Washington, we call that a win-win.

388
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,180
我盡我所能 給予了我方捍衛民主所需的工具
I did what I did to give our side the tools they need to defend democracy.

389
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,730
我只是避免了繁文縟節 那些沒什么用 只會拖延時間
I just avoided the typical red tape that does nothing but cause the delays

390
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,650
造成生命損失
that cost lives.

391
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,940
還在這個過程中中飽私囊
And lined your pockets in the process.

392
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,730
再次重申 這叫雙贏
Again, win-win.

393
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,650
我不想讓無辜群眾因為這種武器而死
But I don't want innocent people to die because of it.

394
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,410
我是政客 不是怪物 雷徹先生
I'm a political animal, I'm not a monster, Mr. Reacher.

395
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,280
而且我不是請你幫忙
And I'm not asking for your help,

396
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,160
我是給你提供幫助
I'm offering you mine.

397
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
你也是那種喜歡把事情做好的人
You're the kind of man who likes to gets things done, too.

398
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,420
你在軍隊和馬格雷夫的記錄 證明了這一點
Your record in the military, and in Margrave, proves that.

399
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,960
你喜歡打亂計劃
You like to upset the apple cart.

400
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,590
我準備給予你所需要的一切 協助你完成這項任務
Well, I'm prepared to give you whatever you need to aid you in that endeavor.

401
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,550
等你完工后
And when you're done,

402
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,930
沒有人能證明你曾卷入過那些計劃
no one will be able to prove that you were ever near those apples in the first place.

403
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,470
就把這些東西砸成碎片
Just smash this thing to bits.

404
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,020
把這些人全都一網打盡 不遺留任何人威脅他人生命
Leave no man left standing. No one left to endanger lives.

405
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,650
然后你就又可以消失了 沒有人會繼續找你
And then you can disappear again. No one will go looking for you.

406
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,860
我們是你的朋友
Or your friends.

407
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,600
怎么
Yeah?

408
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,640
嘿 不怎么快樂的巨人
Hey, Not-So-Jolly Green Giant.

409
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,970
你已經把那套衣服扔了嗎
You throw away that suit yet?

410
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,480
沒有 怎么了
No. Why?

411
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,230
驗尸官終于歸還了弗朗茨的尸體
Coroner finally released Franz's body.

412
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,400
葬禮在明天舉行
Funeral's tomorrow.

413
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,110
我們得回紐約
We got to go back to New York.

414
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,490
葬禮

415
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,200
我讓我的辦公室做了一些零星的調查
Had my office make some discrete inquiries.

416
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
丹佛的警察發現了 被槍擊的卡車和被掉包的拖車
Denver sheriffs found the shot-up truck with a switched-out trailer.

417
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,710
- 里面什么都沒有 只有幾塊磚 - 它們完美匹配
Nothing in it but crates of bricks. Guessing they perfectly matched

418
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,880
發射器和導彈的重量
the weight of the launchers and the missiles.

419
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,260
是的 看來他們的計劃 是開車將假的貨物
Yep. It seems their plan was to drive the dummy cargo down

420
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,630
運送到洛杉磯港口
to the port in L.A.

421
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,680
然后送到菲律賓的軍事基地
And ship it to an Army base in the Philippines

422
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,890
或者任何那武器應該去的地方
or wherever the weapons were supposed to go.

423
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,430
根據我們的資料顯示 是韓國
South Korea, according to the documents we saw.

424
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,180
真聰明
Smart.

425
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,480
貨船從西海岸到那里 需要三到四周的時間
Three to four weeks for a cargo ship to get there from the West Coast,

426
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,230
在另一邊開箱前 沒人知道武器失蹤了
no one knows the weapons were missing till they open it up on the other end.

427
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,190
誰知道那要多長時間呢
And who knows how long that could be?

428
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,110
軍隊可能會直接將其放到倉庫 幾個月都不看它們
Army could just load it into storage and not see them again for months.

429
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,860
到那時 為時已晚
And by then, it's too late.

430
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,610
恐怖分子已經擊落了數十架飛機
Terrorists have taken down dozens of planes

431
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,450
而我們還不知道 他們從哪兒弄來的武器
and we have no idea where they got the firepower.

432
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,070
說起武器
Speaking of firepower,

433
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,240
有任何關于真正的導彈的 去向的線索嗎
we have any leads as to where the real missiles went?

434
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,960
科羅拉多州警方在丹佛外的 一塊田里發現了那輛卡車 是空的
Colorado State Police found the truck in a field outside Denver. It was empty.

435
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,370
根據卡車在泥土里的痕跡來看
Based on the tracks in the dirt,

436
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,250
他們認為一架私人飛機 連夜把武器帶走了
they think a private plane flew the weapons out overnight.

437
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,630
它可能會去往任何地方
Could be headed here.

438
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,010
自從911以后 紐約上空就一直受到了密切地監控
Since 9/11, they've kept a pretty close watch on New York's skies.

439
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,380
我們知道AM很謹慎
And we know A.M.'s cautious.

440
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,220
如果我是他
I were him,

441
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,600
我會把它們帶到 賓夕法尼亞州的某個小機場里
I'd fly them into some small airstrip in Pennsylvania,

442
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,970
也可以是新罕布什爾州 再開車將武器運到紐約
maybe New Hampshire, then drive the weapons into New York

443
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,930
好給它們加上小翅膀軟件
to load them up with the Little Wing software.

444
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,850
言之有理
That makes sense.

445
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,600
我們需要知道導彈 到底是在往哪兒運才能攔截它們
We need to know exactly where the missiles are headed so we can intercept them.

446
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,770
因為當錢易手時
'Cause when the money changes hands,

447
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,780
AM會到場 殺了我們的人的兇手也在
A.M. will be there, and so will the people who killed our guys.

448
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,530
雷徹 你看到那玩意了嗎
Reacher. You seeing this shit?

449
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,710
那不是那天他車里的玩具嗎
Isn't that that toy he had in his car the other day?

450
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,750
米奇 我的侄子也有一個
Mikey. My nephews have the same one.

451
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,880
這是個很棒的玩具 我們一直一起玩
It's a great toy. We play with it all the time.

452
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,430
我小時候 我有海王
When I was a kid, I had Aquaman.

453
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,430
我覺得他跟魚說話的方式太酷了
I thought it was so cool how he could talk to fish.

454
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,980
因為我當時也想跟我的狗說話
'Cause I wanted to talk to my dog, you know?

455
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,860
嘿
Hey.

456
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,200
我也想把這張照片給你 這是我的
I want you to have this, too. This was mine.

457
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,370
圣杰羅姆
Saint Jerome.

458
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,200
他是爸爸或媽媽去了天堂的 孩子的守護神
He's the patron saint of kids whose moms and dads go to heaven.

459
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,210
我希望你每晚都念
I want you to say the prayer...

460
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,880
這照片后面的祈禱詞
...on the back, every night.

461
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,630
它會讓你爸離你近點
It'll help keep your dad close.

462
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,390
你能做到嗎
Can you do that?

463
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,350
好孩子
Good boy.

464
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,730
好孩子
Good boy.

465
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,360
你有任何需要 就給我打電話
You need anything, you call me.

466
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,360
白天晚上都行
Day or night.

467
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,900
- 謝謝 - 沒事
- Thank you. - Yeah.

468
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,240
來吧 米奇 葬禮要開始了
Come on, Mikey. They're just about to start.

469
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,750
你為什么要送玩具 給我死去的朋友的兒子
Why are you giving toys to my dead friend's son?

470
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
什么
Excuse me?

471
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,790
和孩子相處融洽 就能刷媽媽的好感度
Cozy up to the kid, score points with Mom.

472
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,840
你看到一個悲傷的寡婦 心想:“這個目標容易得手”
You see a grieving widow and think, "Easy target"?

473
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,050
你現在在跟我開玩笑嗎  你是想找死嗎
Are you kidding me right now? You got some kind of death wish?

474
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,600
有些人這么想
Some people think so.

475
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
我是來表達敬意的
I'm here to pay my respects.

476
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,600
為什么昨晚在波士頓 有一個摩托車團伙攻擊我
Why did a biker gang take a run at me in Boston last night?

477
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,520
因為你是個混蛋
'Cause you're an asshole.

478
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,310
可能吧 也可能是因為 我們只把我們的行蹤告訴了你
Possibly. Or maybe it's 'cause you're the only person I told  we were going there.

479
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,980
等等 你是想說我是黑警
Wait, wait, wait. Are you trying to say that I'm bent?

480
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,650
我什么都沒想說
Not trying to say anything.

481
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,660
你知道我為什么跟米奇說話嗎  因為我知道他在經歷什么
You know why I was talking to Mikey? Because I know what he's going through.

482
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,280
我知道每晚看著窗戶外面
I know what it is to look out the window every night

483
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,370
祈禱街上來的是自己父親的車 是什么感覺
and pray that the next set of headlights coming down the street is your father's car,

484
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,710
即使你知道那永遠不會發生
even though you know it'll never happen,

485
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,210
因為你親眼看到 羅馬諾殯儀館的那些家伙
because you saw the guys from Romano's funeral home

486
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,130
在他的棺材上撒土
throw dirt on his casket.

487
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,300
你知道失去家人是什么感覺嗎
Do you know what it is to lose family?

488
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,840
是啊 他們都死了 全都死了
Yeah, they're all dead. Every one of them.

489
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,590
而我在說你
And I was talking about you,

490
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,510
- 沒說你爸 - 我在說他
not your father. I'm talking about him.

491
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,140
我爸曾是一名警察 一個好警察
My father was a cop, a good one,

492
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,310
他拒絕受賄 因此被人殺害
and he refused to be on the take and they killed him for it.

493
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,650
聽著
Look,

494
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,730
我知道那是 你朋友的兒子和遺孀 我懂
I know that's your friend's son and widow. I get it.

495
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,900
但如果你再說我是黑警
But you call me dirty one more time,

496
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,200
我不在乎我們是否是站在圣母像面前
and I don't care if we're standing in front of the statue of the Holy Mother,

497
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,950
我會新賬老賬一起算 就在這里狠狠揍你一頓
I will give you that beating that I owe you right here.

498
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,870
第一 只要你想 我隨時奉陪
One, I'll take that fight any time you want.

499
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,830
第二
And two...

500
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,420
我不知道你父親的事
I didn't know that about your father.

501
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,920
是啊 你不知道的事可多了去了
Yeah, well, what you don't know could fill the Javits.

502
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,800
因為天知道你在波士頓做什么的時候
Because while you were in Boston doing God knows what,

503
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,090
我在忙著查新時代安保部的人
I was running those security names from New Age.

504
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,220
他們全都是前紐約市警察局的
All former NYPD,

505
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,800
全部來自第三分局
all from the 3rd precinct.

506
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,600
老板蘭斯頓和其他幾個人 都接受過內務部的調查
The boss, Langston and a few other guys, they were under investigation by IA.

507
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,730
他們提前退休了 那些指控就消失了
They took early retirement and the charges went away.

508
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,440
然后他們全都在新時代 找到了輕松的工作 雇傭了所有朋友
Then they all got cushy jobs at New Age, and they hired all their pals along.

509
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,070
整個團隊全是黑警
Whole team of bad cops?

510
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,780
所有人 除了你的朋友 斯旺
Everybody except your buddy Swan.

511
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,150
但他是唯一一個有從軍經歷
But he's the only one that has military experience

512
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,320
知道恐怖分子 想要哪種武器的人 所以...
to know what type of weapons terrorists want, so...

513
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,450
現在你在含沙射影地說 會讓我生氣的事
Now you're implying something that's pissing me off.

514
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,410
你不能否認這種猜想是合理的
You can't deny he makes sense for this.

515
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,410
根據他的背景 這一切可能都是他主使的
With his background, for all we know, he might have put the whole thing together.

516
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,170
所有警察 全是黑警 都是一個轄區的
All cops, all bad, all from the same precinct.

517
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,630
- 你審問過他們中任何人嗎  - 問不了
- You interview any of them? - Couldn't.

518
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,710
你在他們辦公的地方砸出了一個大洞
You turned their office into a drive-through.

519
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,130
他們躲起來了
They went to the ground.

520
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,430
他們的住處空無一人 跟托尼斯旺的住處一樣
Their places were empty, just like Tony Swan's.

521
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,640
你想罵某人是黑警  先查查你自己的后院吧
You want to call somebody dirty? First look in your own backyard.

522
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,780
因此 我們要將我們的兄弟 卡爾文弗朗茨埋葬
We therefore commit our brother Calvin Franz to the ground,

523
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,320
歸于大地 塵歸塵 土歸土
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

524
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,370
讓往生者安寧
in sure and certain hope of the resurrection

525
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,910
讓在世者重獲解脫 阿門
to the eternal life.

526
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,330
阿門
Amen.

527
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,820
鳴槍隊 注意
Firing party, attention.

528
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,700
待命
Stand by.

529
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,910
準備
Ready.

530
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,540
瞄準
Aim.

531
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,670
開火
Fire.

532
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,460
準備
Ready.

533
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,760
瞄準 開火
Aim. Fire.

534
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,510
- 趴下  - 開火
- Get down! - Fire...

535
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,890
我保護你們 快 我們走
I got you. Come on. Let's go.

536
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,270
離開這里 快走
Get out of here. Go.

537
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,230
有人開槍 快跑
Active shooters! Run!

538
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,150
走

539
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,290
- 幾個人  - 據我所知 兩個
How many? As far as I can tell, two.

540
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,250
- 在路對面 - 手槍沒用 得離近點
Across the road. Handguns are useless from this distance. We got to get closer.

541
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,460
包抄他們 內格利和我 負責右邊的那個
Flank them. Neagley and I will take the one on the right.

542
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,250
你們倆負責左邊那個 上
You two take the one on the left. Go.

543
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,240
我們盡可能接近 還不夠
Close as we're gonna get. It's not enough.

544
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,780
可以等警察來
We could wait for the cops.

545
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,490
不能讓他們跑了 他們一聽到警笛就會散開
We can't let them get away. As soon as they hear sirens, they scatter.

546
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,540
好吧 我來吸引火力 你去干掉他們
All right. I'll draw their fire, you take them out.

547
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,250
- 我拒絕 - 你能做到
- Negative. - You can do this.

548
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,960
你射得很準
-You're a great shot.

549
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,130
但你跑得很慢
But you're a slow runner.

550
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,180
去你的
Fuck this.

551
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,850
糟了

552
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,750
上車
Get in!

553
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,430
你現在相信我了 還是饑不擇食了
So, you trust me now, or are you just desperate?

554
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,890
我看見你保護安吉拉和米奇 所以我猜你說的是真的
I saw you protect Angela and Mikey, so I guess you're playing it square.

555
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,810
但你那兒有內鬼 那是肯定的
You got a rat in your house, though, that's for sure.

556
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,150
媽的 拉索 開快點
Shit, Russo, it's the pedal on the right.

557
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,110
讓我做我的工作
Let me do my job.

558
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,790
抄近路
Cut the corner.

559
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,330
- 有路緣石 - 跳過去
- There's a curb. - Jump the curb!

560
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,500
你能別管我怎么開車嗎
Will you climb out of my ass?

561
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,880
我以為這應該是高速追逐戰
I thought this was supposed to be a high-speed pursuit.

562
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,060
- 我們最好的線索要被你搞丟了 - 你想來開車嗎
You're losing our best lead. You want to drive?

563
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,520
好啊
Yes.

564
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,980
嘿
Hey, hey.

565
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,960
- 你真他媽是個禍害  - 你開車像個瞎子一樣
You're a fucking menace, you know that? You drive like you're blind.

566
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,590
別開槍 我受夠了 好嗎 我受夠了
Don't shoot. I'm done. Okay? I'm done.

567
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,640
- 你被捕了 混蛋 - 不
You're under arrest, asshole. No.

568
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,520
這些人在光天化日之下 攻擊我們 還是在人多的葬禮上
These guys took a run at us in broad daylight at a crowded funeral.

569
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,560
他們越來越絕望了 這意味著這事快到緊要關頭了
They're getting desperate. Means this thing's coming to a head fast.

570
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,440
我們拘留他 他會請律師 在為時已晚前緘口不言
We take him in, he lawyers up and doesn't talk until it's too late

571
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,280
恐怖分子有650次機會 擊落一架商業客機
and a terrorist has 650 chances to take down a commercial airliner.

572
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,650
所以你想讓我做什么
So, what do you want me to do?

573
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
看向另一邊
Look the other way.

574
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,410
拜托 伙計
Oh, come on, man.

575
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,790
如果你不告訴我你知道的一切
By not telling me everything you know,

576
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,800
那就是在保護殺了我朋友的人
you're protecting the people who killed my friends.

577
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,010
我不會浪費時間 用那些審訊技巧
I'm not gonna waste my time with enhanced interrogation techniques.

578
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,840
我只會奪走你的生命
I'm just gonna squeeze the life out of you.

579
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,550
如果你在你死前 想完全卸下自己的負擔
So, if at any point before you die you feel like fully unburdening yourself...

580
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:04,810
那就眨眼
blink.

581
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,820
- 現在說話 - 好的
- Talk, now. - Okay. Okay.

582
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,900
天啊 讓我喘口氣
Christ. Let me catch my breath.

583
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,790
我們本來應該利用21響禮炮的槍聲
We were supposed to use the gunfire from the 21-gun salute

584
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,830
來掩蓋我們的射擊
to mask our shot.

585
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,290
干掉你和你的團隊成員
Take you and your team down

586
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,540
在任何人搞清楚狀況前離開
and get out of there before anyone knew what was going on.

587
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,500
對于專業槍手來說 賺這錢輕松容易
Easy payday for a couple professional hitters.

588
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,750
- 跟我說些我不知道的事 - 比如
- Tell me something I don't know. - Like what?

589
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,210
蘭斯頓不會一開始就把所有錢都給你
Langston wouldn't give you all the cash up front.

590
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,670
你要在哪里見他拿尾款
Where are you supposed to meet him to get the rest of the money?

591
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,800
皇后區某個破爛街區的 一棟廢棄建筑里
An abandoned building in some shitty neighborhood in Queens.

592
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,890
我可以帶你們去
Look, I-I can take you there.

593
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,850
但我不認識蘭斯頓
But I don't know any Langston.

594
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,810
那是誰雇的你
Then who hired you?

595
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,600
一個叫斯旺的家伙
Some guy called Swan.

596
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,700
收到
Copy that.

597
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,200
迪克森和奧唐納已就位 拉索在街上
Dixon and O'Donnell are in position. Russo's down the street.

598
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,660
所有出口都已覆蓋
All exits are covered.

599
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,660
聽到了嗎  你要是敢亂來 你會后悔的
Hear that? You try anything, you'll be sorry.

600
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,040
你進去拿錢 給我們這地方的信息
But you go in there, get paid, give us the rundown...

601
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,330
里面有多少人 他們帶著什么武器
How many inside, what they're packing...

602
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,540
房間的布局 人都坐在哪里
Layout of the room, where everyone's sitting...

603
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,840
然后我們就放了你 你可以留著錢 懂了嗎
We'll cut you loose and you get to keep the cash. Understood?

604
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,170
好的 隨便吧
Yeah, man. Whatever.

605
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,260
我只希望永遠都不會再見到你們
I just never want to see you people again.

606
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
把你的手機給我
Give me your phone.

607
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,150
把這個放在口袋里 這樣我們就能監聽
Keep this in your pocket so we can listen in.

608
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,780
你要是敢做小動作 我們會突然進攻 你就跟他們一起死吧
You try anything, we come in hot and you die with the rest of them.

609
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,650
去吧 蠢貨
Get going, stupid.

610
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,210
我們在想什么
So, what are we thinking?

611
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,460
斯旺去新時代工作
Swan went to work for New Age,

612
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,840
看到了他一直夢寐以求的賺錢機會 然后就接受了
saw a chance to make the kind of money he always dreamed of and took it?

613
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,750
然后呢
Then what?

614
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,590
他跟弗朗茨一起出去玩 他們都在一個城市
He was hanging out with Franzy, them being in the same city and all,

615
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,380
不小心透露了什么 讓弗朗茨產生了懷疑
slipped and said something that made Franz suspicious?

616
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,970
或者他試著拉弗朗茨入伙
Or... tried to get Franz in on it?

617
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,600
心想要養老婆和孩子 他也需要錢
Figured with a wife and kid, he'd need the money, too.

618
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,310
弗朗茨拒絕了
Franz said no,

619
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,980
試圖阻止 打電話給 桑切斯和奧羅斯科求助
tried to stop it, called Sanchez and Orozco for help.

620
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,070
那聽起來對嗎
That sound about right?

621
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,240
我不知道 但如果斯旺真在那棟樓里
I don't know, but if Swan's really in that building,

622
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,530
我也會像對待那家伙一樣對待斯旺
I'm gonna do the same thing I did to that guy.

623
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,910
用手掐住他的脖子 從他嘴里榨出真相
Wrap my hand around his neck and squeeze the truth out of him.

624
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,990
在那之后呢
And after that?

625
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,420
你好
Hello?

626
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,210
有人嗎
Anyone?

627
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,180
字幕翻譯: 匡思穎

628
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,270
