1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,050
Well, whatever your friends were involved in was big enough to get them killed.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,970
There's no way the Tony Swan I recruited is a part of this.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,550
Seems Swan's title was assistant director of security.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,680
"Shane Langston. Director of Security."

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,930
Maybe he's the guy I got on the phone in Atlantic City.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,230
We need to talk to Malcolm Lavoy.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,610
We'll never get close enough to a senator to find out what he may or may not know.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,070
Oh, we don't need to. Daniel Boyd, Senator Lavoy's legislative director.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,280
Little Wing can knock anything out of the sky.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
New Age has two bases.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,330
Software made in New York, hardware at a manufacturing plant in Denver.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,540
What are our directives?

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,870
You and Dixon go to Denver. O'Donnell and I will head down to D.C.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,580
Want to swing by Homeland, see what they know about A.M.

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,830
Saddle up...

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,340
...'cause we're about to do a whole lot of cowboy shit.

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,810
Quit it!

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm gonna get you!

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,100
No, you're not.

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,690
Don't drop my teddy ever again or I will...

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,110
...at your face.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,650
Stop it!

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,110
You got the EpiPens?

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,410
- Yes, of course. - And woobie?

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,160
Woobie, Panda-pal, Lindsay the Monkey, they're all packed.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,870
Grab the burner phone. No contact with anyone. Not your parents,

28
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,370
and definitely not your sister. She puts everything on Facebook.

29
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,870
I know the drill.

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,920
Go to Asheville. Take the boys. Plenty for you to do there.

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,340
It's touristy. You'll blend in.

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,760
Use cash and this pay-as-you-go credit card.

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,590
Scale of one to ten, how bad is this?

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,130
They're not gonna come after you.

35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,680
We're just playing it safe. Belts and suspenders.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
One to ten.

37
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,770
For you guys? Four, tops.

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,350
How about you?

39
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,730
Well, we're dealing with some pretty bad guys, but...

40
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,070
I got the gang with me. We'll be fine.

41
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,480
It'll be over in a couple of days, promise.

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,940
I got to get the baby ready.

43
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,570
Give my tie back!

44
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,830
I need...

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,990
She doesn't panic.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Accepts reality on reality's terms.

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,960
Daughter of an ER nurse, Chicago fire chief.

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,170
Tough as they come.

49
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,210
Beautiful, tough, smart.

50
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,420
She lose a bet?

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,840
...dinner. That's what I'm making.

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,970
If someone asked me back in the day where I thought you'd wind up,

53
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,930
I'd have predicted a slow death from gonorrhea

54
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,600
and a half dozen girlfriends fighting over an '04 Miata.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,190
Yeah, well, turns out I didn't want every girl in the world,

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,230
just the right one.

57
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,190
Neagley and Dixon just got to the Denver plant.

58
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,200
Good. Maybe they get ahold of those missiles

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,990
and your family won't have to be gone long.

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,620
You're a slowpoke.

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,620
Okay.

62
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,840
A few days wouldn't hurt.

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,760
I will.

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,060
The DCMA was here a month ago.

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,970
Yeah, and now we're back.

66
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,940
We're the cold sores of government oversight.

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,100
Now, if you please? Your foreman?

68
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,690
Wait here.

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,820
Never ceases to amaze me how far you can get into a place

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,580
if you just act like you're supposed to be there and carry a clipboard.

71
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
How you feeling?

72
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,580
Sore.

73
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,670
Well, fighting in heels takes some getting used to.

74
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,760
Walking in heels takes some getting used to. Never wore 'em.

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,630
You never wore heels?

76
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,930
Nope.

77
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,680
Not even to a school dance?

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,100
Never went to one.

79
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,390
When I wasn't studying or taking care of my dad, I had to work.

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,150
Well, bad music, warm punch and some clammy hands feeling you up...

81
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,730
you didn't miss much.

82
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,280
Nobody told me about this.

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,580
Wouldn't be a surprise inspection if we called ahead.

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,620
Uncle Sam wants to make sure you're using his money wisely.

85
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,170
So we're here to take a look at Little Wing shoulder-fired launchers and missiles.

86
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,710
The specs, the manufacturing protocols,

87
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,670
the order and delivery schedules...

88
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,210
Delivery schedule?

89
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,470
Ten minutes ago. That's the delivery schedule.

90
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,970
The whole lot just went out the door.

91
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,470
All 650 of them.

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,020
650?

93
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,270
Here's the paperwork.

94
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,230
If someone had called me first, I'd have held them for you.

95
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,190
- Shit. - Yeah.

96
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,180
Hey, there.

97
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,400
You need an extra set of hands?

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,350
What I need

99
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,940
is your truck.

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,690
We're in business.

101
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,080
Give me good news.

102
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,790
GPS tracker did the job. Your associates at New Age came through.

103
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,290
They might be upset I killed the driver, though.

104
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,800
Oh, they won't care so long as they get paid.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,590
Never underestimate the power of greed.

106
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,380
Switch the trailers and get on the road. Will do.

107
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,800
Meet you in New York.

108
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,480
This name, right here...

109
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,810
...Azhari Mahmoud.

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,570
So, the Aaron Miklos we were chasing down in Denver,

111
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,980
that was Mahmoud?

112
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,860
Yeah, we've been calling him "A.M."

113
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,120
Guy's smart. Never been caught, no photos.

114
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,830
Hell, we're not even sure what nationality he is.

115
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,160
From the little bit we know of him,

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,580
he can supposedly pass for Central American,

117
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,540
Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern.

118
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
He's a ghost.

119
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,800
We have three short, innocuous recordings of him.

120
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,670
Audio forensics matched it as the same guy.

121
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,720
Each time, he's using a different identity.

122
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,680
Ideology?

123
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,600
No political or religious affiliations.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,850
His only god is money, and he works for the highest bidder.

125
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,190
He hooks up bad actors with the tools they need for bad actions.

126
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,310
First popped up on our radar six years ago.

127
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,690
Terrorist cell caught trying to acquire tanks of experimental nerve gas.

128
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,030
We scooped up the whole lot.

129
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,820
All of them except Mahmoud.

130
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,700
Or whatever his name is.

131
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,490
Ghost.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
This buy was supposed to happen with bearer bonds.

133
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,960
Yeah, financial instrument of choice for tax evaders,

134
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,130
money launderers and other assorted assholes.

135
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,380
The U.S. Treasury stopped issuing those in the '80s.

136
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,180
Some countries still use them. Those were from Luxembourg.

137
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,470
Someone as cautious as A.M. would use bearer bonds.

138
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,890
If issued in large enough amounts,

139
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,270
you can carry an untraceable fortune in a briefcase.

140
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,770
65 million worth.

141
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,980
That's the problem.

142
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,600
You hold a bearer bond, that's like carrying a million dollar bill.

143
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,810
The bearer owns it.

144
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,570
So no way A.M. lets anyone deliver payment but him.

145
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,650
That's where he's vulnerable.

146
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
Just like your brother.

147
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,660
Back when we worked the case, I asked Joe

148
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,490
some questions of the financial side of things.

149
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,580
He said same thing you just did.

150
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,920
A.M. will be the delivery boy. No one else.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,630
Okay. We showed you ours.

152
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,670
Now it's your turn.

153
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,640
We're still piecing it together, but, uh...

154
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,390
we give you our word, when this bird's cooked,

155
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,600
- we'll reach out. - And you have my word

156
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,230
we won't let this guy slip through our fingers again.

157
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,770
A.M. and everyone working with him

158
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,440
will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

159
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,860
Unless we kill them all first.

160
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,540
Thanks, guys.

161
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,090
Just like his brother.

162
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,620
18-wheelers can't go that fast on these roads.

163
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,120
We've got a decent shot at catching them.

164
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,960
Yeah, especially if they come to a stop.

165
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,090
Who are these guys?

166
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,640
They're the guys who are gonna tell us the truck broke down

167
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,730
and they had to call another one to come pick up the trailer.

168
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,520
But no way a second truck got here before us.

169
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,440
No.

170
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,440
This is a hijacking.

171
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,730
Any chance you're wrong?

172
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,700
I'm not wrong! How the fuck did they know who we are?

173
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,870
Foreman must've called New Age about two government inspectors.

174
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,700
Langston finds out and calls these dickheads.

175
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,420
The fuck?

176
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,150
I think we got him.

177
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,110
Yeah.

178
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,780
Also looks like we got a front tire and gas tank.

179
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,580
- We're not getting out of here. - No. I'll call the cops.

180
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,120
Make it anonymous.

181
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
Copy that.

182
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,630
Do me a favor, grab the manifest. We need the license plate off of it.

183
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,430
Oh, shit.

184
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,850
What's up, Neagley?

185
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,400
Hell of a lot, actually.

186
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,730
We got to talk fast, because cops are on the way to a body count

187
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,610
and we got to put some distance between us and them.

188
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,030
Anything to put you at the scene?

189
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,030
Rental car.

190
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,530
It was shot to hell, but it was rented with Dixon's fake ID.

191
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,410
We torched it to get rid of prints and DNA.

192
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,540
Good. So what happened out there?

193
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,330
You want the bad news or the worse news?

194
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,250
Surprise us.

195
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,880
Well, a New Age truck with all 650 missiles in it was hijacked.

196
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,130
I hope that's the worse news. You wish.

197
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,720
Tony Swan's alive.

198
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,340
- So that's a good thing. - No.

199
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,590
It looks like Swan's still working with New Age.

200
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,510
According to the bill of lading, Swan personally signed off on the shipment

201
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,810
before it left the factory.

202
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,890
So he's in Denver?

203
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,060
No, the paperwork said he authorized it from New York.

204
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,900
So they forged his signature.

205
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,560
- It's a digital thumbprint. - Then they forced him.

206
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,110
New Age New York has iris scanners on the doors,

207
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,440
thumbprint locks on the computers.

208
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,820
There's no way that anyone could force Tony Swan

209
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,410
through that maze of biometrics without causing a huge scene.

210
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,530
The only way they wouldn't worry about a ruckus

211
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,500
is if all thousand-plus employees were in on this thing,

212
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,540
and the odds of a conspiracy that vast are...

213
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,500
Minimal.

214
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,670
I know you want to believe Swan's clean, boss, we all do,

215
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,550
but things look the way they look. Talk when we're safe, okay?

216
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,220
Reacher?

217
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
Copy that.

218
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,730
So what you said about killing them all...

219
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,270
...that include Tony Swan?

220
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,690
I'm going for a walk.

221
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,580
You boys won't be needing these.

222
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,130
Yeah, we're all friends here.

223
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
Took their guns.

224
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,220
Long as they didn't find the wire Swan's wearing,

225
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,470
we're five by five.

226
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,890
Like that miscreant said,

227
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,390
"We're all friends here."

228
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,180
Let's see what you got, G.I. Joe. G.I. Joe?

229
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,930
More like Mighty Joe Young.

230
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,020
How'd you like to be jammed into a foxhole with this giant motherfucker?

231
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,730
We'll beat whatever price you're paying now.

232
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,110
Our supplier can get you all the H you can move from an overseas source

233
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,150
that's in no position to negotiate terms.

234
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,530
We pass the savings on to you.

235
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,590
Okay.

236
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,590
Let's talk money.

237
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,720
Soon as they agree to a deal, we go.

238
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,350
Bust them, lean on them, they give up their source;

239
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,310
we bust them, then we all get bumped.

240
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,720
More fruit salad on our chests...

241
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,890
More dollar signs on our paychecks, bro.

242
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,020
Why would they add dollar signs to our paychecks?

243
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,190
Shut up, Franzy.

244
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,570
The kid's got a point, Manuel. You only need one dollar sign.

245
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,860
Assholes.

246
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,570
Heads up. We got incoming.

247
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,630
About time.

248
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
110?

249
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,430
You said you could beat our current price.

250
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,430
I am beating it.

251
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,510
Not by enough.

252
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,770
You want us to change suppliers, motivate us.

253
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,770
This is chicken. I said pork.

254
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,520
Okay. Fucking idiots always get it wrong. How's 105?

255
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,320
Sounds like you're wasting my fucking time.

256
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,440
- You got forks? - You have another brick as pure as that for 105?

257
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,150
Seen better. Bullshit.

258
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,860
I got a list of other buyers a mile long.

259
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,660
- I came to you... - I know you.

260
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,580
...because you purchase at a volume, which makes it worthwhile. I don't think so.

261
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,540
Yeah, I do. Where do I know you from?

262
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,540
Uh-oh.

263
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,040
Hold on. Might be nothing.

264
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,920
- No idea. - Look, I have other offers coming in. - I know we've met before.

265
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,090
What can you do for me? 100. Take it or leave it.

266
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,550
I got it. You're the guy I sold my guitar to a while back.

267
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,810
You got me mixed up with somebody else.

268
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,680
Craigslist, dude.

269
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,100
You bought my acoustic.

270
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,440
We gonna eat and discuss old times or are we gonna make a deal?

271
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,780
You assholes don't want this stuff, we got other places we can sell it.

272
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,740
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, when this guy bought it,

273
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,490
he was in an Army cop uniform.

274
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,630
Fuck. Go, go, go, go.

275
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,550
Look out!

276
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,690
- Call an ambulance! - Don't shoot!

277
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,070
We have an officer down. We need medical assistance.

278
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,150
The bullet missed your heart. But shattered my collarbone.

279
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,700
Not gonna be playing that guitar for a while.

280
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,660
Every cloud...

281
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,320
Fuck you.

282
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,410
Hey, who don't you mess with?

283
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,490
The Teamsters?

284
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,710
I owe you one.

285
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,480
Let me guess.

286
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,360
Government plates, government suits, government rides.

287
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,610
Surprised it took Senator Lavoy this long

288
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,070
to figure out who sweated his flunky last night.

289
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,070
The senator has a proposition for you. Get in.

290
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,950
No.

291
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,780
Why not, Mr. Reacher?

292
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,910
Just "Reacher."

293
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,330
Fine, Reacher. Why won't you get in the car?

294
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,250
Because he didn't ask nicely.

295
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,170
Okay.

296
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,210
Hart, what's the magic word?

297
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,720
Please get in the vehicle?

298
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,110
My man in Denver barely got away with the merchandise.

299
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,280
I'm paying a premium for a seamless transaction,

300
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,410
and so far this has been anything but seamless.

301
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,370
If these problems persist, there may have to be a price adjustment.

302
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,660
Some of Mr. Swan's old friends are causing us problems,

303
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,370
but it's nothing we can't handle.

304
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,590
If you want the merchandise, you honor the deal.

305
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,170
Do what you promised and I will.

306
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,170
Okay.

307
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,880
Good.

308
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,100
Where are you now?

309
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,350
I am just outside...

310
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,640
Oh, no, t-this can't be right. "French Lick"?

311
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,810
Fucking Americans.

312
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,730
Indiana.

313
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,940
Okay. The Little Wing chips will be ready to install

314
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,700
in the missiles by the time you get here.

315
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,410
And Mr. Swan's associates will be taken care of.

316
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,070
That plan's already in motion.

317
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,370
Fuck your king.

318
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,460
Prick.

319
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,380
Backstage at the primate exhibit?

320
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,090
Dramatic.

321
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,470
Thought you might feel comfortable among the gorillas.

322
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,730
Mr. Reacher, I'm Malcolm Lavoy.

323
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,520
- He prefers just "Reacher." - No.

324
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,230
He has to call me "Mister."

325
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,110
My apologies for the manner in which you were brought in here, Mr. Reacher.

326
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,860
Assume you use this location 'cause it's one of the few spots in D.C.

327
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,910
where you can meet without prying eyes or surveillance bugs.

328
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,450
Mm-hmm. It's why I got myself appointed to the zoo's board.

329
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,790
Ah, I believe you know my legislative director, Mr. Boyd.

330
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,040
Yeah,

331
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,830
he's the one who likes cocaine.

332
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,420
You know, when I found out what happened,

333
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
I reached out to a friend of mine at the Bureau.

334
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,340
Imagine Boyd's embarrassment when he learned

335
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,930
that the people he revealed our secrets to

336
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,850
weren't FBI agents in the first place.

337
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,060
Security video showed you entering the precinct

338
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,980
and facial recognition software matched you to a military ID.

339
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,150
Jack Reacher.

340
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,030
No middle name. West Point, two Silver Stars,

341
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,070
a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and so on.

342
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,200
Show some respect.

343
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,990
That is quite a list, and I want to thank you for your service, by the way.

344
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,080
Seems like after you retired, you kind of fell off the face of the Earth.

345
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,380
Except for this incident a couple years ago in Margrave, Georgia.

346
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,760
Charged with the murder of your own brother.

347
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,220
You were, of course, exonerated.

348
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,590
Then a massive counterfeiting operation

349
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,430
that Joe had been investigating

350
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,470
literally and figuratively burned to the ground.

351
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,140
Now, the official story was

352
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,020
that it was all the work of a rookie cop and an out-of-town veteran.

353
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,320
The same out-of-town veteran that arrested Boyd here in Boston.

354
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,360
Get to the point. Smells like monkey shit in here.

355
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,700
Well, I know it was you in Margrave, Mr. Reacher.

356
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,790
I want you to do the same thing for the situation we have here.

357
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,130
Why?

358
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,340
Because in Boston, you insinuated to Boyd

359
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,340
that military and civilian aircraft could be in danger due to Little Wing.

360
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,840
Now, I can only assume that means that terrorists

361
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,680
are interested in the tech,

362
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,010
working hard to obtain it.

363
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,980
See, once we identified you, we looked into things deeper

364
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,810
and we learned that your old unit's back together,

365
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,400
and some are dead.

366
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,690
Don't look so shocked, Mr. Reacher,

367
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,610
I'm a U.S. congressman, I get things done.

368
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,950
I'm shocked because a U.S. congressman got anything done.

369
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,660
I'm used to the slings and arrows, Mr. Reacher.

370
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,960
But bottom line, the people who want this weaponry

371
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,620
can never be allowed to have it.

372
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,590
Because if anyone knew you were involved in the shady dealings

373
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,090
that created Little Wing in the first place, you'd be indicted.

374
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,590
Get rid of the bad guys, keep my hands clean.

375
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,220
In Washington, we call that a win-win.

376
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,180
I did what I did to give our side the tools they need to defend democracy.

377
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,730
I just avoided the typical red tape that does nothing but cause the delays

378
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,650
that cost lives.

379
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,940
And lined your pockets in the process.

380
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,730
Again, win-win.

381
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,650
But I don't want innocent people to die because of it.

382
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,410
I'm a political animal, I'm not a monster, Mr. Reacher.

383
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,280
And I'm not asking for your help,

384
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm offering you mine.

385
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
You're the kind of man who likes to gets things done, too.

386
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,420
Your record in the military, and in Margrave, proves that.

387
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,960
You like to upset the apple cart.

388
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,590
Well, I'm prepared to give you whatever you need to aid you in that endeavor.

389
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,550
And when you're done,

390
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,930
no one will be able to prove that you were ever near those apples in the first place.

391
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,470
Just smash this thing to bits.

392
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,020
Leave no man left standing. No one left to endanger lives.

393
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,650
And then you can disappear again. No one will go looking for you.

394
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,860
Or your friends.

395
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,600
Yeah?

396
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,640
Hey, Not-So-Jolly Green Giant.

397
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,970
You throw away that suit yet?

398
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,480
No. Why?

399
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,230
Coroner finally released Franz's body.

400
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,400
Funeral's tomorrow.

401
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,110
We got to go back to New York.

402
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,200
Had my office make some discrete inquiries.

403
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
Denver sheriffs found the shot-up truck with a switched-out trailer.

404
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,710
Nothing in it but crates of bricks. Guessing they perfectly matched

405
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,880
the weight of the launchers and the missiles.

406
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,260
Yep. It seems their plan was to drive the dummy cargo down

407
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,630
to the port in L.A.

408
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,680
And ship it to an Army base in the Philippines

409
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,890
or wherever the weapons were supposed to go.

410
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,430
South Korea, according to the documents we saw.

411
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,180
Smart.

412
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,480
Three to four weeks for a cargo ship to get there from the West Coast,

413
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,230
no one knows the weapons were missing till they open it up on the other end.

414
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,190
And who knows how long that could be?

415
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,110
Army could just load it into storage and not see them again for months.

416
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,860
And by then, it's too late.

417
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,610
Terrorists have taken down dozens of planes

418
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,450
and we have no idea where they got the firepower.

419
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,070
Speaking of firepower,

420
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,240
we have any leads as to where the real missiles went?

421
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,960
Colorado State Police found the truck in a field outside Denver. It was empty.

422
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,370
Based on the tracks in the dirt,

423
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,250
they think a private plane flew the weapons out overnight.

424
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,630
Could be headed here.

425
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,010
Since 9/11, they've kept a pretty close watch on New York's skies.

426
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,380
And we know A.M.'s cautious.

427
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,220
I were him,

428
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,600
I'd fly them into some small airstrip in Pennsylvania,

429
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,970
maybe New Hampshire, then drive the weapons into New York

430
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,930
to load them up with the Little Wing software.

431
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,850
That makes sense.

432
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,600
We need to know exactly where the missiles are headed so we can intercept them.

433
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,770
'Cause when the money changes hands,

434
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,780
A.M. will be there, and so will the people who killed our guys.

435
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,530
Reacher. You seeing this shit?

436
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,710
Isn't that that toy he had in his car the other day?

437
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,750
Mikey. My nephews have the same one.

438
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,880
It's a great toy. We play with it all the time.

439
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,430
When I was a kid, I had Aquaman.

440
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,430
I thought it was so cool how he could talk to fish.

441
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,980
'Cause I wanted to talk to my dog, you know?

442
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,860
Hey.

443
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,200
I want you to have this, too. This was mine.

444
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,370
Saint Jerome.

445
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,200
He's the patron saint of kids whose moms and dads go to heaven.

446
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,210
I want you to say the prayer...

447
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,880
...on the back, every night.

448
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,630
It'll help keep your dad close.

449
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,390
Can you do that?

450
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,350
Good boy.

451
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,730
Good boy.

452
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,360
You need anything, you call me.

453
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,360
Day or night.

454
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,900
- Thank you. - Yeah.

455
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,240
Come on, Mikey. They're just about to start.

456
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,750
Why are you giving toys to my dead friend's son?

457
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
Excuse me?

458
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,790
Cozy up to the kid, score points with Mom.

459
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,840
You see a grieving widow and think, "Easy target"?

460
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,050
Are you kidding me right now? You got some kind of death wish?

461
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,600
Some people think so.

462
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
I'm here to pay my respects.

463
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,600
Why did a biker gang take a run at me in Boston last night?

464
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,520
'Cause you're an asshole.

465
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,310
Possibly. Or maybe it's 'cause you're the only person I told  we were going there.

466
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,980
Wait, wait, wait. Are you trying to say that I'm bent?

467
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,650
Not trying to say anything.

468
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,660
You know why I was talking to Mikey? Because I know what he's going through.

469
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,280
I know what it is to look out the window every night

470
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,370
and pray that the next set of headlights coming down the street is your father's car,

471
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,710
even though you know it'll never happen,

472
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,210
because you saw the guys from Romano's funeral home

473
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,130
throw dirt on his casket.

474
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,300
Do you know what it is to lose family?

475
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,840
Yeah, they're all dead. Every one of them.

476
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,590
And I was talking about you,

477
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,510
not your father. I'm talking about him.

478
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,140
My father was a cop, a good one,

479
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,310
and he refused to be on the take and they killed him for it.

480
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,650
Look,

481
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,730
I know that's your friend's son and widow. I get it.

482
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,900
But you call me dirty one more time,

483
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,200
and I don't care if we're standing in front of the statue of the Holy Mother,

484
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,950
I will give you that beating that I owe you right here.

485
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,870
One, I'll take that fight any time you want.

486
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,830
And two...

487
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,420
I didn't know that about your father.

488
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,920
Yeah, well, what you don't know could fill the Javits.

489
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,800
Because while you were in Boston doing God knows what,

490
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,090
I was running those security names from New Age.

491
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,220
All former NYPD,

492
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,800
all from the 3rd precinct.

493
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,600
The boss, Langston and a few other guys, they were under investigation by IA.

494
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,730
They took early retirement and the charges went away.

495
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,440
Then they all got cushy jobs at New Age, and they hired all their pals along.

496
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,070
Whole team of bad cops?

497
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,780
Everybody except your buddy Swan.

498
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,150
But he's the only one that has military experience

499
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,320
to know what type of weapons terrorists want, so...

500
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,450
Now you're implying something that's pissing me off.

501
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,410
You can't deny he makes sense for this.

502
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,410
With his background, for all we know, he might have put the whole thing together.

503
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,170
All cops, all bad, all from the same precinct.

504
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,630
- You interview any of them? - Couldn't.

505
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,710
You turned their office into a drive-through.

506
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,130
They went to the ground.

507
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,430
Their places were empty, just like Tony Swan's.

508
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,640
You want to call somebody dirty? First look in your own backyard.

509
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,780
We therefore commit our brother Calvin Franz to the ground,

510
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,320
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

511
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,370
in sure and certain hope of the resurrection

512
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,910
to the eternal life.

513
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,330
Amen.

514
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,820
Firing party, attention.

515
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,700
Stand by.

516
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,910
Ready.

517
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,540
Aim.

518
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,670
Fire.

519
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,460
Ready.

520
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,760
Aim. Fire.

521
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,510
- Get down! - Fire...

522
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,890
I got you. Come on. Let's go.

523
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,270
Get out of here. Go.

524
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,230
Active shooters! Run!

525
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,290
How many? As far as I can tell, two.

526
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,250
Across the road. Handguns are useless from this distance. We got to get closer.

527
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,460
Flank them. Neagley and I will take the one on the right.

528
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,250
You two take the one on the left. Go.

529
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,240
Close as we're gonna get. It's not enough.

530
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,780
We could wait for the cops.

531
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,490
We can't let them get away. As soon as they hear sirens, they scatter.

532
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,540
All right. I'll draw their fire, you take them out.

533
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,250
- Negative. - You can do this.

534
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,960
-You're a great shot.

535
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,130
But you're a slow runner.

536
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,180
Fuck this.

537
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,750
Get in!

538
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,430
So, you trust me now, or are you just desperate?

539
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,890
I saw you protect Angela and Mikey, so I guess you're playing it square.

540
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,810
You got a rat in your house, though, that's for sure.

541
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,150
Shit, Russo, it's the pedal on the right.

542
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,110
Let me do my job.

543
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,790
Cut the corner.

544
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,330
- There's a curb. - Jump the curb!

545
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,500
Will you climb out of my ass?

546
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,880
I thought this was supposed to be a high-speed pursuit.

547
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,060
You're losing our best lead. You want to drive?

548
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,520
Yes.

549
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,980
Hey, hey.

550
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,960
You're a fucking menace, you know that? You drive like you're blind.

551
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,590
Don't shoot. I'm done. Okay? I'm done.

552
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,640
You're under arrest, asshole. No.

553
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,520
These guys took a run at us in broad daylight at a crowded funeral.

554
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,560
They're getting desperate. Means this thing's coming to a head fast.

555
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,440
We take him in, he lawyers up and doesn't talk until it's too late

556
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,280
and a terrorist has 650 chances to take down a commercial airliner.

557
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,650
So, what do you want me to do?

558
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Look the other way.

559
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,410
Oh, come on, man.

560
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,790
By not telling me everything you know,

561
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,800
you're protecting the people who killed my friends.

562
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,010
I'm not gonna waste my time with enhanced interrogation techniques.

563
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm just gonna squeeze the life out of you.

564
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,550
So, if at any point before you die you feel like fully unburdening yourself...

565
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:04,810
blink.

566
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,820
- Talk, now. - Okay. Okay.

567
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,900
Christ. Let me catch my breath.

568
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,790
We were supposed to use the gunfire from the 21-gun salute

569
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,830
to mask our shot.

570
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,290
Take you and your team down

571
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,540
and get out of there before anyone knew what was going on.

572
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,500
Easy payday for a couple professional hitters.

573
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,750
- Tell me something I don't know. - Like what?

574
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,210
Langston wouldn't give you all the cash up front.

575
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,670
Where are you supposed to meet him to get the rest of the money?

576
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,800
An abandoned building in some shitty neighborhood in Queens.

577
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,890
Look, I-I can take you there.

578
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,850
But I don't know any Langston.

579
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,810
Then who hired you?

580
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,600
Some guy called Swan.

581
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,700
Copy that.

582
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,200
Dixon and O'Donnell are in position. Russo's down the street.

583
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,660
All exits are covered.

584
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,660
Hear that? You try anything, you'll be sorry.

585
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,040
But you go in there, get paid, give us the rundown...

586
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,330
How many inside, what they're packing...

587
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,540
Layout of the room, where everyone's sitting...

588
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,840
We'll cut you loose and you get to keep the cash. Understood?

589
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,170
Yeah, man. Whatever.

590
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,260
I just never want to see you people again.

591
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Give me your phone.

592
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,150
Keep this in your pocket so we can listen in.

593
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,780
You try anything, we come in hot and you die with the rest of them.

594
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,650
Get going, stupid.

595
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,210
So, what are we thinking?

596
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,460
Swan went to work for New Age,

597
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,840
saw a chance to make the kind of money he always dreamed of and took it?

598
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,750
Then what?

599
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,590
He was hanging out with Franzy, them being in the same city and all,

600
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,380
slipped and said something that made Franz suspicious?

601
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,970
Or... tried to get Franz in on it?

602
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,600
Figured with a wife and kid, he'd need the money, too.

603
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,310
Franz said no,

604
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,980
tried to stop it, called Sanchez and Orozco for help.

605
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,070
That sound about right?

606
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,240
I don't know, but if Swan's really in that building,

607
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,530
I'm gonna do the same thing I did to that guy.

608
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,910
Wrap my hand around his neck and squeeze the truth out of him.

609
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,990
And after that?

610
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,420
Hello?

611
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,210
Anyone?
