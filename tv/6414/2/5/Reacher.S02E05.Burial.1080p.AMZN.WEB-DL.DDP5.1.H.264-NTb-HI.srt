00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,687
[Zimmerman] Craigslist, dude.

317
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,146
You bought my acoustic.

318
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,819
We gonna eat
and discuss old times

319
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,445
or are we gonna make a deal?

320
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,798
You assholes
don't want this stuff,

321
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,182
we got other places
we can sell it.

322
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,743
[Zimmerman] Wait a minute.

323
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,287
Wait a minute,
when this guy bought it,

324
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,540
he was in an Army cop uniform.

325
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,595
Fuck.

326
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,889
- Go, go, go, go.

333
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,652
{\an8}- [grunts]
- We have an officer down.

334
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,136
{\an8}- We need medical assistance.
- The bullet missed your heart.

[grunts]

{\an8}- Hey, who don't you mess with?
- The Teamsters?

339
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,089
I owe you one.

345
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,821
Surprised it took
Senator Lavoy this long

346
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,073
to figure out who sweated
his flunky last night.

347
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,035
The senator has a proposition
for you. Get in.

348
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,953
No.

349
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,916
- Why not, Mr. Reacher?
- Just "Reacher."

350
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,336
Fine, Reacher.
Why won't you get in the car?

351
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,254
Because he didn't ask nicely.

352
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,923
Okay.

353
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,675
Hart, what's the magic word?

354
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,764
Please get in the vehicle?

355
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,114
<i>[A.M.] My man in Denver barely
got away with the merchandise.</i>

356
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,992
I'm paying a premium
for a seamless transaction,

357
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,037
and so far this has been
anything but seamless.

358
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,455
If these problems persist,

359
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,332
there may have to be
a price adjustment.

360
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,418
Some of Mr. Swan's old friends
are causing us problems,

361
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,337
but it's nothing
we can't handle.

362
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,132
If you want the merchandise,
you honor the deal.

363

<i>Do what you promised and I will.</i>

364
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,473
Okay. Good.

365
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,100
Where are you now?

366
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,853
I am just outside...

367
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,479
Oh, no, t-this can't be right.

- Fucking Americans.
<i>- Indiana.</i>

370
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,153
Okay.

371
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,037
The Little Wing chips
will be ready to install

372
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,324
in the missiles
by the time you get here.

373
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,327
And Mr. Swan's associates
will be taken care of.

374
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,038
- That plan's already in motion.
- [phone beeps]

Backstage

381
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,849
Dramatic.

382
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,476
Thought you might feel
comfortable among the gorillas.

383
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,147
Mr. Reacher, I'm Malcolm Lavoy.

384
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,108
- He prefers just "Reacher."
- No.

385
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,693
He has to call me "Mister."

386
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,403
My apologies
for the manner in which

387
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,281
you were brought in here,
Mr. Reacher.

388
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,450
Assume you use this location
'cause it's one

389
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,285
of the few spots in D.C.
where you can meet

390
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,329
without prying eyes
or surveillance bugs.

391
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,415
Mm-hmm. It's why I got myself
appointed to the zoo's board.

392
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,709
- [footsteps approaching]
- Ah, I believe you know

393
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,061
my legislative director,
Mr. Boyd.

394
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,839
Yeah, he's the one
who likes cocaine.

395
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,925
[Lavoy] You know,
when I found out what happened,

396
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,427
I reached out to a friend
of mine at the Bureau.

397
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,180
Imagine Boyd's embarrassment
when he learned

398
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,933
that the people
he revealed our secrets to

399
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,851
weren't FBI agents
in the first place.

400
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,813
Security video showed you
entering the precinct

401
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:35,068
and facial recognition software
matched you to a military ID.

402
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,279
Jack Reacher. No middle name.

403
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,032
West Point, two Silver Stars,

404
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,534
a Bronze Star,
Purple Heart and so on.

405
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,244
Show some respect.

406
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,806
That is quite a list,
and I want to thank you

407
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,749
for your service, by the way.

408
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,167
Seems like after you retired,

409
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,086
you kind of fell off
the face of the Earth.

410
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,922
Except for this incident
a couple years ago

411
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,340
in Margrave, Georgia.

412
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,760
Charged with the murder
of your own brother.

413
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,221
[Lavoy] You were,
of course, exonerated.

414
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,349
Then a massive
counterfeiting operation

415
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,226
that Joe had been investigating

416
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,396
literally and figuratively
burned to the ground.

417
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,106
Now, the official story was

418
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,566
that it was all the work
of a rookie cop

419
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,568
and an out-of-town veteran.

420
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,404
The same out-of-town veteran

421
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,322
that arrested Boyd here
in Boston.

422
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,865
Get to the point.

423
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,368
Smells like monkey shit in here.

424
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,163
Well, I know it was you
in Margrave, Mr. Reacher.

425
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,458
I want you to do the same thing
for the situation we have here.

426
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,343
- Why?
- Because in Boston, you insinuated to Boyd

427
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,345
that military
and civilian aircraft

428
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,222
could be in danger
due to Little Wing.

429
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,158
Now, I can only assume
that means that terrorists

430
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,019
are interested in the tech,
working hard to obtain it.

431
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,563
See, once we identified you,
we looked into things deeper

432
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,898
and we learned that
your old unit's back together,

433
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,359
and some are dead.

434
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,319
Don't look so shocked,
Mr. Reacher,

435
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,613
I'm a U.S. congressman,
I get things done.

436
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,950
I'm shocked because a U.S.
congressman got anything done.

437
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,286
[laughs]

438
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,705
I'm used to the slings
and arrows, Mr. Reacher.

439
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,332
But bottom line,

440
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,626
the people
who want this weaponry

441
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,170
can never be allowed to have it.

442
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,796
Because if anyone knew

443
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,399
you were involved
in the shady dealings

444
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,675
that created Little Wing
in the first place,

445
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,093
you'd be indicted.

446
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,429
Get rid of the bad guys,
keep my hands clean.

447
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,347
In Washington,
we call that a win-win.

448
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,602
I did what I did to give
our side the tools they need

449
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,520
to defend democracy.

450
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,023
I just avoided the typical
red tape that does nothing

451
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,650
but cause the delays
that cost lives.

452
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,611
And lined your pockets
in the process.

453
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,572
Again, win-win.

454
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,283
But I don't want innocent people
to die because of it.

455
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,369
I'm a political animal,
I'm not a monster, Mr. Reacher.

456
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,247
And I'm not asking
for your help,

457
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,166
I'm offering you mine.

458
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,752
You're the kind of man who likes
to gets things done, too.

459
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,421
Your record in the military,
and in Margrave, proves that.

460
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,465
You like to upset
the apple cart.

461
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,675
Well, I'm prepared to give you
whatever you need

462
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,178
to aid you in that endeavor.

463
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,180
And when you're done,

464
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,241
no one will be able to prove
that you were ever near

465
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,934
those apples in the first place.

466
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,396
Just smash this thing to bits.
Leave no man left standing.

467
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,024
No one left to endanger lives.

468
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,777
And then you can
disappear again.

469
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,987
No one will go looking for you.

470
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,906
Or your friends.

471
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,137
[phone ringing]

Yeah?

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,644
Hey, Not-So-Jolly Green Giant.

475
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,188
<i>- You throw away that suit yet?</i>
- No. Why?

476
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,232
<i>Coroner finally
released Franz's body.</i>

477
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,234
Funeral's tomorrow.

478
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,153
We got to go back to New York.

479
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,406
[phone beeps off]

480
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,791
[Neagley] Had my office make
some discrete inquiries.

481
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,352
Denver sheriffs
found the shot-up truck

482
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,711
with a switched-out trailer.

483
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,272
[Dixon] Nothing in it
but crates of bricks.

484
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,731
[O'Donnell] Guessing they
perfectly matched the weight

485
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,941
of the launchers
and the missiles.

486
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,884
[Neagley] Yep.
It seems their plan

487
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,653
was to drive the dummy cargo
down to the port

488
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,262
- in L.A.
- And ship it to an Army base

489
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,891
in the Philippines or wherever
the weapons were supposed to go.

490
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,310
[Dixon] South Korea, according
to the documents we saw.

491
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,811
[O'Donnell] [scoffs] Smart.

492
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,855
Three to four weeks
for a cargo ship to get there

493
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,524
from the West Coast, no one
knows the weapons were missing

494
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,234
till they open it up
on the other end.

495
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,944
And who knows how long
that could be?

496
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,422
Army could just
load it into storage

497
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,673
and not see them again
for months.

498
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,490
And by then, it's too late.

499
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,326
Terrorists have taken down
dozens of planes

500
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,453
and we have no idea
where they got the firepower.

501
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,413
Speaking of firepower,
we have any leads

502
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,856
as to where
the real missiles went?

503
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,355
Colorado State Police
found the truck

504
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,959
in a field outside Denver.

505
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,963
- It was empty.
- Based on the tracks in the dirt,

506
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:07,256
they think a private plane
flew the weapons out overnight.

507
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,758
Could be headed here.

508
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,277
Since 9/11, they've kept
a pretty close watch

509
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,636
on New York's skies.

510
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,346
And we know A.M.'s cautious.

511
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,016
[Neagley] I were him, I'd fly
them into some small airstrip

512
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,684
in Pennsylvania,
maybe New Hampshire,

513
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,495
then drive the weapons
into New York to load them up

514
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,855
- with the Little Wing software.
- That makes sense.

515
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,875
We need to know exactly
where the missiles are headed

516
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,525
so we can intercept them.

517
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,444
'Cause when the money
changes hands,

518
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,822
A.M. will be there, and so will
the people who killed our guys.

519
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,624
Reacher. You seeing this shit?

520
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,960
Isn't that that toy he had
in his car the other day?

521
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,795
[Russo] Mikey.

522
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,713
My nephews have the same one.

523
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,882
It's a great toy.

524
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,885
We play with it all the time.

525
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:57,181
When I was a kid, I had Aquaman.

526
00:25:57,265 --> 00:26:01,394
I thought it was so cool
how he could talk to fish.

527
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,479
'Cause I wanted to talk
to my dog, you know?

528
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,821
Hey.

529
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,783
I want you to have this, too.

530
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,370
This was mine. Saint Jerome.

531
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,830
He's the patron saint of kids

532
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,249
whose moms and dads
go to heaven.

533
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,252
I want you to say the prayer...

534
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,589
...on the back,

535
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,509
every night.

536
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,012
It'll help keep your dad close.

537
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,808
Can you do that?

538
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,228
Good boy.

539
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,857
Good boy.

540
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:53,321
You need anything, you call me.

541
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,947
Day or night.

542
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,533
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

543
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,953
Come on, Mikey.
They're just about to start.

544
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,751
Why are you giving toys
to my dead friend's son?

545
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,419
Excuse me?

546
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:12,506
Cozy up to the kid,
score points with Mom.

547
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,510
You see a grieving widow
and think, "Easy target"?

548
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,512
Are you kidding me right now?

549
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,890
You got some kind of death wish?

550
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,684
- Some people think so.
- I'm here to pay my respects.

551
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:26,187
Why did a biker gang take a run
at me in Boston last night?

552
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,564
- 'Cause you're an asshole.
- Possibly.

553
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,375
Or maybe it's 'cause
you're the only person I told

554
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,318
- we were going there.
- Wait, wait, wait.

555
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,695
Are you trying to say
that I'm bent?

556
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,739
Not <i>trying</i> to say anything.

557
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,826
You know why I was
talking to Mikey?

558
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,661
Because I know what
he's going through.

559
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,872
I know what it is to look out
the window every night

560
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,624
and pray that the next
set of headlights

561
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,310
coming down the street
is your father's car,

562
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,252
even though you know
it'll never happen,

563
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,713
because you saw the guys
from Romano's funeral home

564
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,840
throw dirt on his casket.

565
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,717
Do you know what it is
to lose family?

566
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,553
Yeah, they're all dead.
Every one of them.

567
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,139
And I was talking about you,
not your father.

568
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,516
I'm talking about him.

569
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,893
My father was a cop, a good one,

570
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,646
and he refused to be on the take
and they killed him for it.

571
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,529
Look, I know that's
your friend's son and widow.

572
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,738
I get it.

573
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,448
But you call me dirty
one more time,

574
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,866
and I don't care
if we're standing

575
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,785
in front of the statue
of the Holy Mother,

576
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,955
I will give you that beating
that I owe you right here.

577
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,834
One, I'll take that fight
any time you want.

578
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,545
And two...

579
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,422
I didn't know that
about your father.

580
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,715
Yeah, well, what you don't know
could fill the Javits.

581
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,427
Because while you were in Boston
doing God knows what,

582
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,096
I was running those
security names from New Age.

583
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,433
All former NYPD,
all from the 3rd precinct.

584
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,685
The boss, Langston
and a few other guys,

585
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,603
they were under investigation
by IA.

586
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,356
They took early retirement
and the charges went away.

587
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,567
Then they all got
cushy jobs at New Age,

588
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,444
and they hired
all their pals along.

589
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,862
Whole team of bad cops?

590
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,780
Everybody except
your buddy Swan.

591
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,824
But he's the only one
that has military experience

592
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,326
to know what type of weapons
terrorists want, so...

593
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,454
Now you're implying something
that's pissing me off.

594
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,372
You can't deny
he makes sense for this.

595
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,875
With his background,
for all we know,

596
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,477
he might have put
the whole thing together.

597
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,754
All cops, all bad,
all from the same precinct.

598
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,507
- You interview any of them?
- Couldn't.

599
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,718
You turned their office
into a drive-through.

600
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:21,927
They went to the ground.

601
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,389
Their places were empty,
just like Tony Swan's.

602
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,808
You want to call somebody dirty?

603
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,685
First look in your own backyard.

604
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:43,073
We therefore commit our brother
Calvin Franz to the ground,

605
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:47,328
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

606
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,831
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection

607
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,666
to the eternal life.

608
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,959
Amen.

609
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,866
Firing party, attention.

610
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,745
Stand by.

611
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,291
Ready.

612
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,630
Aim.

613
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,257
Fire.

614
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,384
Ready.

615
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,718
Aim.

616
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,845
- Fire.
- [gunshots]

617
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,517
- Get down!
- Fire...

618
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,103
[people screaming]

619
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,938
I got you. Come on. Let's go.

620
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,273
[Neagley] Get out of here. Go.

621
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,650
Active shooters! Run!

622
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,791
[grunts] How many?

623
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,377
As far as I can tell, two.
Across the road.

624
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,313
Handguns are useless from this
distance. We got to get closer.

625
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,315
Flank them. Neagley and I will
take the one on the right.

626
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,882
You two take
the one on the left.

627
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,301
Go.

628
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,242
Close as we're gonna get.
It's not enough.

629
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,828
- We could wait for the cops.
- We can't let them get away.

630
