1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,250
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,090
I got your message.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,340
110th, 10-30. A distress call.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,720
Calvin Franz was murdered.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,680
If he was calling you for help, he may have been trying to get in touch with the rest of the unit.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,140
I called O'Donnell, Dixon, Sanchez and Orozco. No one's answering.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,230
I paid off the concierge.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,740
He I.D.'d Neagley as checking in.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,780
Just keep an eye on that hotel and them.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,660
No one will really know who you are. But you know.

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,590
Hey, O'Donnell. Hey, Neagley.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,960
Just a list of names, all starting with the initials "A.M."

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,260
I just got page after page of random numbers.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,550
No order, no meaning. Nothing. At least to us, for now.

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,600
What are you thinking?

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,350
I'm thinking there's someone hell-bent on taking out the special investigators.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,020
And they're coming after us.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,980
Good.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,940
So, if someone's coming after the 110, how come they haven't made a run at the three of us yet?

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,320
You were in the woods with your family, no one can ever find me

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,570
and maybe they just hadn't gotten around to Neagley yet.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,160
They were in our hotel rooms,

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,160
maybe to grab us or take us out, but then had to bail for some reason.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,420
We need to try again to warn the others.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll call Sanchez and Orozco. I got Dixon.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
There's a black sedan across the street, couple houses down.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,460
Same one as yesterday.

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,090
Guess you were right. We're being followed.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,430
How you want to play this?

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,310
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,770
Look at this fucking beaut.

32
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,950
What's he think he's gonna do?

33
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,080
Fucking nose, man.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,670
Gun!

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,590
Just like the good old days.

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,520
Yeah, you on the sidelines while I do all the work.

37
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,230
Uh, fellas, this was his gun.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,310
NYPD?

39
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,570
Name's Gaitano Russo.

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,650
Don't look at me. You did all the work.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,750
Got to say, man. Major screwup.

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,170
Soon as Russo wakes up, the entire NYPD's gonna be after your ass.

43
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,970
Why'd you got to hit him so hard, huh?

44
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,300
I don't hit soft.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,680
Well, a cop puncher's gonna do some serious time. I was pissed about the dog,

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,480
and I assumed he was involved in killing Franzy and Swan.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,150
What did you teach us? "In an investigation, assumptions kill."

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,570
No, it was "In an investigation, details matter".

49
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,280
I didn't kill him, just broke his nose. He'll be fine when he wakes up.

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,450
Shit. Gaitano Russo.

51
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,160
Guy Russo. He's the investigating officer in Franz's homicide.

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,750
I saw it in the files. And how'd he get on your tail?

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,670
NYPD saw the calls Franz made to you, flagged your name,

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,590
got an alert when you bought the plane tickets,

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,300
been on you since you landed. Question is "why?"

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,550
Question is "where?"

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,180
As in, where do we hide a six-foot-five felon so you don't wind up in the pokey.

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm not leaving. The case is here.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,180
Maybe not.

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,970
When I called Sanchez and Orozco's office, voice mail was full.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,140
That's a bad sign.

62
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,230
So it might not be a bad time to get out of Dodge,

63
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,650
considering Cocky Balboa here just knocked out a lawman.

64
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,190
Fine. We'll head down to Atlantic City,

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,990
see if we can find the guys.

66
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,240
First we got to check out of our hotel and find a more generic ride

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,790
before Russo regains consciousness and puts out a BOLO.

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,620
Range Rover's too conspicuous.

69
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,960
You're the reason we can't have nice things.

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,310
Wait, I don't understand. Was it a car accident?

71
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,230
No, he just kicked the car.

72
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,360
Well, then how the hell did the airbag go off?

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,690
He kicked the car,

74
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,570
then he pulled the cop out and he knocked his dick in the dirt.

75
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm telling you, this guy's a beast.

76
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,780
When the time comes, I'm gonna need some backup.

77
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,450
And you'll get it.

78
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,710
But for now, you just stay on their asses, and don't fuck this up.

79
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,420
Understood.

80
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,130
Short-term airport parking only in Lot 1.

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,890
Short-term airport parking only in Lot 1.

82
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,060
There's a 2019 Accord for sale up in Tremont for way under market value.

83
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,350
Cash-only deal.

84
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,280
One of the most stolen makes and models for sale in the Bronx, and the guy wants no paperwork?

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
We sit in that thing, we burn our asses.

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,160
We don't have a choice. We're flagged in the system. We can't rent anything under our names.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Well, we drive around in a stolen vehicle, we risk getting pinched.

88
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,660
I've got our solution.

89
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,880
How was your undercover job?

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,550
Reacher.

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
How'd you know I was undercover?

92
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,770
Considering the circumstances, you would've come right away.

93
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,020
But you didn't, which can only mean you didn't get our messages until recently.

94
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,070
But if you were on vacation, you would've checked in with your office periodically.

95
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,200
So you had to be working undercover, deep undercover,

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,490
where frequent check-ins aren't always possible.

97
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,910
Same old Reacher.

98
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,620
Corporate embezzlement case.

99
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,830
Stuck in Texas so long, I started to think

100
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,040
I actually liked cowboy boots and high school football.

101
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,670
Still got your fake ID with you?

102
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,250
- Yeah. - Good.

103
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,880
Use it to rent the car. What's with all the secrecy?

104
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,840
Neagley, O'Donnell and I have been flagged in the system.

105
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,170
And I punched out a cop.

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,140
Of course you did.

107
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,640
So...

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,310
Franz.

109
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,390
Yeah.

110
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,810
And Swan, most likely.

111
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,820
Sanchez and Orozco are MIA, too.

112
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,320
Okay.

113
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,580
Okay, so we take care of business.

114
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,330
You do not mess with the special investigators.

115
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,920
Next.

116
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,300
Make sure you get an... SUV. I know. You need the headroom.

117
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,820
Good. Glad to see you're still here.

118
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,610
Feel like I'm never gonna leave.

119
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,110
If it's reported at any Army base anywhere in the world,

120
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,660
no matter how minor the infraction, we're copied on it.

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,830
Well, anything jump out at you?

122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,910
Yeah, a rat the size of a honeydew about 20 minutes ago.

123
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,910
- Seriously? - Yeah.

124
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,670
It's back in those boxes somewhere.

125
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,040
Gross.

126
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,420
Well, speaking of rats, I think I smell one.

127
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,970
A commanding officer at a base in Afghanistan thinks someone's stealing aviation fuel.

128
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,090
Siphoning off gas to resell it on the side?

129
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,390
Not exactly the kind of priority case the Army wants us taking on.

130
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,810
Right, but see, I don't think anybody's stealing and reselling anything.

131
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,440
Take a look at these numbers. They always tell a story.

132
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,190
See, I noticed that every time fuel went missing from the base,

133
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,650
it was always after a specific flight.

134
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,820
Whenever C-17s ferried Humvees back home to the States.

135
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,240
I mean, it's a minor detail, but in an investigation, details matter.

136
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,540
I like that.

137
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,500
I'm gonna use it.

138
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,080
What's mine is yours.

139
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,170
So...

140
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,380
you have a theory?

141
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,300
Yeah. There's been no indication of black market fuel sales

142
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
anywhere on or around the base,

143
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,470
so how does all that fuel go missing?

144
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,600
Best way to make gas disappear is to burn it up.

145
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,020
Exactly. Now, Neagley's got the bulk fuel experience

146
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,350
and she thinks all the Humvee flights are intentionally being over-fueled.

147
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,230
But, when those planes land,

148
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,360
the amount of fuel in the tanks is exactly what's expected,

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,280
and that gets logged into the books.

150
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,820
So, how does that happen?

151
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,700
The excess fuel is being used to transport more weight

152
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,450
than people realize is on the plane. Yeah.

153
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,160
Something heavy and secret is being moved.

154
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,420
Exactly. Contraband in the Humvees.

155
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,670
Drugs, guns, stolen cash, all of the above.

156
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,090
Good work, Dixon.

157
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,470
You just found a case worthy of our attention.

158
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,970
I don't know about you, but all this sleuthing's made me thirsty.

159
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,890
Want to go celebrate?

160
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,850
You can buy me a drink.

161
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,230
I got to keep working on these reports.

162
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,940
Maybe next time. Yeah.

163
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,990
But again,

164
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,660
excellent work, Dixon. Yeah.

165
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,790
No problem. Like I said, numbers always tell the story.

166
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,610
So, the numbers telling you a story?

167
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,570
Yeah, and it's a David Lynch film. It's totally incomprehensible.

168
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,620
I mean, if these are supposed to be fractions, then it's sloppy work.

169
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,540
Some of them aren't even reduced.

170
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,580
I noticed that, too.

171
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,620
Maybe the numbers represent hard quantities.

172
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,130
Like, eight out of ten somethings, and not just four-fifths of something?

173
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,300
Maybe.

174
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,220
Yeah, maybe. Beyond that, two things stick out.

175
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,890
None of these are 100%, meaning there's no nine out of nine

176
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,010
or ten out of ten, and the first four pages have 26 numbers,

177
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,350
the fifth has 27 and the last two have 26 again.

178
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,560
Could be an accident. Just the way the information's spaced.

179
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,020
No, seems deliberate to me. None of these pages are full.

180
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,860
What about the list of A.M. names?

181
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,150
Means nothing to me. I agree with you guys. It's got to be an alias.

182
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,570
Maybe it's someone with a grudge against the 110th?

183
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,030
We've arrested a lot of people.

184
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,410
What about James Barr?

185
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,700
I mean, that guy's got the skills and a screw loose.

186
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,330
Barr's a shooter. Can't picture him throwing someone out of a helicopter.

187
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,710
Plus, I ran into him in Indiana last year.

188
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,750
He owes me now.

189
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,720
I don't want to know.

190
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,680
Pine Barrens.

191
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,480
About a million lonely acres.

192
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,480
A lot like the spot Upstate New York where they found Franz.

193
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,150
They left his broken body out there to rot.

194
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,570
For all we know, Swan's out there, too.

195
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,620
And Sanchez. And Orozco.

196
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,000
There's no blues station?

197
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,870
Bro, we're in Jersey.

198
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,080
It's from my phone.

199
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,960
Franz used to blast this at HQ all the time when you weren't around.

200
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,010
Leave it.

201
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,150
They rented a car under a fake name, but it's, uh, it's Karla Dixon.

202
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
She's with them now.

203
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
They're headed towards Atlantic City, probably gonna try to find their missing buddies.

204
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,660
Good. All in the same place at once.

205
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,790
When you get there, take them out.

206
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,870
Copy that.

207
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,750
You remember what I said about needing backup? I know some local talent.

208
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,460
Well, bring in whoever you need.

209
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,960
We'll cover the tab.

210
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,050
I just want them dead by tomorrow.

211
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,970
You hear me? Fucking dead.

212
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,580
Just like Franz's office.

213
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,880
And our hotel rooms.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
You said they hadn't trashed Swan's place.

215
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,880
Yup. Add that to the list of things

216
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,510
that must mean something.

217
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,970
You guys ever know Orozco to go anywhere without his lighter?

218
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,350
Better days.

219
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,360
Am I the only one of us that doesn't have this photo?

220
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,280
- Got mine. - Got mine.

221
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,570
On my bookshelf.

222
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,370
Hard to hang a picture on your wall when you don't have walls.

223
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,380
We're wasting our time here.

224
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,300
Agreed. We have what the killers want, and anything worth finding,

225
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,880
they already got.

226
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,130
Where to next?

227
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,630
A bar.

228
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,430
Look at these photos of Sanchez and this woman.

229
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,520
Who under 50 frames photos? We do.

230
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,350
Other than the 110th, how many photos you have at your house?

231
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,560
Not many. But she's framed, so she's important.

232
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
We're going to the Lucky Lounge.

233
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,290
No. You two stay here.

234
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,500
You both look like cops.

235
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,000
What do you two look like?

236
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,170
Lady and the Tramp.

237
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,620
Hey. This woman working today?

238
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,950
Who are you?

239
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,330
Friends of Jorge Sanchez.

240
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey, Dulls.

241
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,290
These guys say they're friends of Sanchez, want to talk to Milena.

242
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,460
Take them back to the office. She's doing the books.

243
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,820
Milena.

244
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,320
Take your shit and get out of here, now.

245
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,950
I get that he's a different kind of guy,

246
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,040
but our commanding officer buys used underwear.

247
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,090
Isn't that the girl from the photo? Oh, shit.

248
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,550
Hey!

249
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,430
This is as far as we're going.

250
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,850
What's going on, fellas?

251
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,520
You guys are gonna stop coming around here and messing with our friends.

252
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,900
Look, pal, you somehow got...

253
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,030
Don't touch me!

254
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

255
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,630
Move your ass.

256
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,220
I'm done, I'm done.

257
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,300
Well, it's a good thing O'Donnell and I didn't go in.

258
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,350
Something could've gone wrong.

259
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,020
You making friends, big fella?

260
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,980
I'm so sorry. I never would've run if I'd known who you were.

261
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,110
I should've recognized you from Jorge's photos.

262
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,030
My guys were just looking out for me.

263
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,950
Scary dude came in here asking for her about a week ago.

264
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,250
Said he was working with Sanchez and Orozco on some big security job.

265
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,830
Broad-shouldered bald guy?

266
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,920
No. He had hair.

267
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,790
Scar down his cheek.

268
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,010
He wanted to know if Sanchez had left any kind of digital storage device with me.

269
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,090
I-I had no idea what he was talking about.

270
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,970
I got a bad vibe off the guy, so soon as he left, I called Jorge.

271
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,010
He didn't answer.

272
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,020
They've gone dark before, part of the job, but this...

273
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,020
feels different.

274
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,730
Then you come in, claiming to know Sanchez,

275
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,650
looking like the kind of people somebody'd hire to rough someone up.

276
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,030
No offense. Assumed you were bad news.

277
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,150
Do you know if Sanchez and Orozco had any recent contact

278
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,820
with Calvin Franz or Tony Swan?

279
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,200
Actually, yeah. He was here a couple weeks ago. They hadn't seen each other in forever.

280
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,910
I took a picture of them.

281
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,710
They were working a case together.

282
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,630
Sanchez told you that? Yeah.

283
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,130
What was it?

284
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,670
He didn't mention details.

285
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,010
Was Swan involved?

286
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,340
He didn't come down to A.C.,

287
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,010
but I heard them mention his name.

288
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,760
You tried asking Franz about this?

289
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,600
- We can't. - Why not?

290
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,430
Someone threw him out of a helicopter.

291
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,820
Oh, my God.

292
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,030
You think Jorge and Manuel are dead, too?

293
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,990
We don't know yet.

294
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,660
If they're alive, we'll find them, but we need your help.

295
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,410
Is there anything else you can recall that you haven't told us?

296
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,420
I don't know.

297
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,550
Last time I saw Jorge, he was sitting on that stool right there.

298
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,470
He got a call. Seemed important.

299
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,800
He say anything?

300
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,720
Kind of. He-he repeated a couple of numbers, kind of like he was surprised by them,

301
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
or-or worried, maybe.

302
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,980
Then he said he was going out for a while, and he never came back.

303
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,440
Do you remember the numbers? Yeah.

304
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
He said,

305
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,820
"650 at 100k each." No idea what he meant by that.

306
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,120
You're sure that's what he said? I'm positive.

307
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
He said, "650 at 100k,"

308
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,710
he kissed me on the cheek and he ran out that door.

309
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,590
You remember the last words someone you love said to you.

310
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,600
We've got the numbers, we've got the New York plates.

311
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,980
Maybe this isn't about someone with a grudge against the 110th.

312
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,860
If you haven't noticed, it's pretty likely four of us have already been killed already.

313
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,940
Milena said Franz was here a couple weeks ago.

314
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,360
If the guys were onto something that made them think we were all in danger,

315
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,860
they would've called then, not weeks later.

316
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,030
650 at 100k, we're talking 65 million bucks.

317
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,530
That's a lot of black chips.

318
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,740
Most places. Not here.

319
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,500
Atlantic City casinos rake in, what?

320
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,920
Gross gaming revenue's got to be a couple billion a year, easy.

321
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,670
65 million, if taken carefully, over time,

322
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,300
could go unnoticed for a while.

323
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,010
Not that long. Not with casino accountants watching the take like hawks.

324
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,760
But could the bad guys hide it in the margins long enough to get away with it

325
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,720
before the calculator crew catches on?

326
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,310
Sanchez and Orozco do freelance casino security.

327
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,940
I mean, maybe it all started with them.

328
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,560
They stumbled onto something big, they needed help...

329
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,570
So they reached out to Franz... maybe Swan.

330
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,780
Guess this whole thing could be tied to gaming.

331
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,820
I'm Ellie, I'll be your server. What can I get you?

332
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,490
The casino's director of security.

333
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
Now, please.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,870
So, you're the 110th.

335
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,120
What's left of us.

336
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,380
Sanchez and Orozco talk about you guys all the time.

337
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
Please.

338
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,960
So, you knew them well?

339
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,010
Uh, yeah. They would do background checks for all the casinos on the boardwalk.

340
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,640
Hold on. Uh, you just said "knew them."

341
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
Past tense.

342
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,470
We have reason to believe they might be dead.

343
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,430
Oh, shit.

344
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,940
I-I just saw them, uh, while I was picking up lunch at White House Subs last month.

345
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,450
How can I help? These numbers mean anything to you?

346
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,240
Not offhand.

347
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,950
What about the phrase, "650 at 100k each"?

348
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,080
No. Uh, what's this all about?

349
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,290
We think Sanchez and Orozco

350
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,170
may have been looking into a $65 million gambling scam.

351
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
Okay.

352
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,010
Uh, well, in that case, your "650" could be rigged slot machines or fixed hands of poker,

353
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,510
but at 100k per hand, that'd be incredibly high stakes.

354
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,310
And I can tell you right now, our books are on mark.

355
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,060
All right? We're not missing a penny.

356
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,650
What about your competitors?

357
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,190
You know, I can... I can ask around,

358
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,690
see if anyone knew what Sanchez and Orozco were working on.

359
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,030
That might narrow it down for you. While you're at it, run these names,

360
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,530
see if any of them are registered at a hotel in town.

361
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,580
Uh... you know, this-this might take a few hours. Where are you guys staying?

362
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,750
Don't know yet.

363
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,840
Well, then, please, allow me.

364
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,130
Not necessary.

365
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,760
No, no. Any friends of Sanchez and Orozco.

366
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,220
Well, it looks like all we have available is a suite.

367
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,890
I guess that'll have to do.

368
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,730
Come on, I'll get you guys settled in.

369
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,140
We'll be fine at a motel. Reacher,

370
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,440
when someone offers to comp you a suite, just say yes.

371
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,980
Yeah. We'll have them send you up a park bench to sleep on.

372
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,280
You'll feel right at home.

373
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,840
What was that about a motel, Reacher?

374
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,050
Whoa. I bet this place has a spa.

375
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm gonna take a schvitz.

376
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,720
Ooh. Dibs on the ocean view.

377
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,880
O'Donnell and Neagley found the bar.

378
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,090
It's fully stocked.

379
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,550
Not for long. You unpacked?

380
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,220
Yup.

381
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,520
I haven't been in a hotel that wasn't advertised as "family friendly" in years.

382
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,690
I still can't believe David O'Donnell procreated.

383
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,240
On purpose, anyway.

384
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,620
Yeah, I seem to remember someone bragging that the only people that would call you Daddy

385
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,120
were the women you slept with.

386
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,870
I still sleep with people who call me Daddy.

387
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,290
Sometimes all three of them if it's thundering outside.

388
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,170
You'll find out soon enough, Dixon.

389
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,960
You're pregnant? What?

390
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,590
No. Shit no.

391
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,460
No, she's engaged. What, you didn't know?

392
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,720
Someone finally lassoed our little filly.

393
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,800
No,

394
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,350
I, um, didn't...

395
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,390
Yeah. Well, about that, you guys can, uh, unsave the date.

396
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,440
Fuck. Seriously?

397
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,520
Yeah, I mean, you know me. I've always been a numbers gal, always had a life plan.

398
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,450
Plan said to get married at a certain age, certain year.

399
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,950
And then one day, I see text messages on his phone.

400
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,370
It says, "Hey, sweetheart, can't wait to see you Friday.

401
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,490
I miss you." And all of that.

402
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,000
No. No one steps out on Dixon.

403
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,540
Not even him, apparently.

404
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,790
Text messages were from his niece who was visiting.

405
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,840
But I realized that when I thought he was cheating,

406
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,090
I was, uh...

407
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
I was relieved.

408
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,760
I mean, he's a decent man. I...

409
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,600
I don't know, if you're gonna spend the rest of your life with somebody,

410
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,690
don't you want to feel something more than comfort?

411
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,230
I mean, don't you want to feel excitement,

412
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,440
a little jolt of something when you see him?

413
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,570
Anyways, you know, for a moment I thought I was gonna get out of it with no mess and no guilt,

414
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,700
but instead, I got out of it with...

415
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,160
A lot of mess and a whole lot of guilt.

416
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,000
Bingo.

417
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,750
Good for you.

418
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,500
Karla Dixon doesn't settle.

419
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,330
Thank you.

420
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,840
That's actually why I took the undercover job.

421
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,050
Take a little time away from it all.

422
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,800
Explain to me how undercover work and forensic accounting go together?

423
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,060
Well, um, CEO embezzling millions from a company down in Texas,

424
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,600
where everybody's packing some kind of heat, and he was the kind of guy to use it if cornered,

425
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,440
so got a little intrigue along with the number-crunching.

426
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,860
All right.

427
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,150
And what about you, Neagley?

428
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,990
Every time I check my LinkedIn, you're getting promoted again.

429
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,570
I'm having fun.

430
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,990
On big cases, running a team now.

431
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,740
Trying to land this huge software company as a client.

432
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,700
I pull it off, I get a taste of that fat contract.

433
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,830
Making it rain.

434
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,210
No choice. I really want to get my dad on round-the-clock nursing care

435
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,000
and rent him a nice place closer to me, but that takes capital.

436
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,880
Why rent? Buy and build equity.

437
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,840
Get a condo. Co-ops are fucking banana republics.

438
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,880
Yeah.

439
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,810
What about you, big dog? Being awfully quiet over there.

440
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,890
Home ownership is like keeping snakes as pets or ballroom dancing competitions.

441
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,770
Fine, if that's what you're into.

442
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,980
I just don't see the appeal. Or the appeal of a steady job.

443
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,650
Corporate world doesn't seem that different from the Army,

444
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,530
and that always felt a little like a cage.

445
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,950
Just didn't know anything else.

446
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,620
Then one day I was in a bar, and someone plays Howlin' Wolf

447
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,580
singing about trains going by in the night.

448
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,580
That sounded like real freedom to me.

449
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,920
Are you jumping on freight trains like Boxcar Willie?

450
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
Sometimes.

451
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,760
Mostly I take buses or hitchhike.

452
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,720
What kind of lunatic is picking up the world's biggest drifter?

453
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,680
They can be interesting. Where do you eat?

454
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,520
I steal pie off windowsills.

455
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,310
I'm being serious. Diners.

456
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,270
Sometimes people who pick me up share a meal with me.

457
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,650
Sometimes I share with them. Where do you sleep?

458
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,200
Cheap motels mostly.

459
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,660
And what if you can't find one?

460
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,410
Unattended boats in marinas are good for a night.

461
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,040
Flatbeds of parked trucks.

462
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,080
Had a great night's sleep in a hammock I spotted in some guy's backyard once

463
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,080
till the sprinklers went off. Good God, man.

464
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,170
All you need is a stick and a bindle. Too much luggage.

465
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,840
Any more questions?

466
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,720
Yeah, just one.

467
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,760
Don't you ever get lonely?

468
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,290
Looks like someone took the sign as a personal challenge.

469
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,920
Doreen, I'm just warming up.

470
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,590
If you liked the dinner, make sure to try Neptune's breakfast buffet.

471
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,840
Every day, starting at 6:00 a.m.

472
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,760
Thank you.

473
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,830
Looks like I'm not the only one who couldn't sleep.

474
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,460
Numbers relax me.

475
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,840
Figured if I was gonna do math, I might as well make some walking-around money. Stand.

476
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,630
Ma'am, you're showing ten and eight on two of your hands.

477
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:27,050
That's right. And I could double down and risk it all for a potentially larger payout.

478
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,310
Or I could stand and have a guaranteed win

479
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,720
because the next card out of that shoe is gonna bust you.

480
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,770
My grandmother always said, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

481
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,940
She's no hog.

482
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,610
I'm no hog, so I'm gonna stand.

483
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,110
As you wish.

484
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,320
15...

485
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,740
Too many.

486
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,910
Congratulations, ma'am.

487
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,450
You're having a very lucky night.

488
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,200
Maybe you'd like to celebrate with a concert on us?

489
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,040
Thank you. Ladies of the '80s.

490
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,120
Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, and Taylor Dane performing their biggest hits.

491
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,870
If you hurry, you can actually catch the second half.

492
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,330
But I'm having fun.

493
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,250
Ma'am, we know you're counting cards.

494
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,460
Which isn't illegal if you do it in your head.

495
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,680
But seeing that your chief of security was kind enough to comp us a suite,

496
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,720
I'll cut you some slack.

497
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,310
Want to use those muscles and help me carry these to the cashier window?

498
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,560
And you can give these tickets to the guy in the Members Only jacket.

499
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,060
He looks like he would enjoy some '80s ladies.

500
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,090
Thanks for coming with.

501
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,390
Late-night walks always clear my head,

502
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,470
and after the text I got from Neagley about Franz, my head's been kind of cloudy, you know?

503
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,520
Yeah.

504
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,730
I'm surprised you can walk at all with all the casino's money in your pockets.

505
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,480
Can I assume the forensic accountant's gonna declare that cash on her taxes?

506
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,110
Those crooks?

507
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,160
If there's anybody I could audit... Actually, it's kind of my dream job.

508
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,240
Current gig doesn't give you your auditing fix?

509
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,540
No, I'm just busting millionaires from stealing from billionaires.

510
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,250
What I really want to do is go after government corruption and waste.

511
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,380
Oh, you used to work for Uncle Sam.

512
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,250
You know what I'm talking about. $600 toilet seats. Exactly.

513
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,630
I mean, if tax money was spent efficiently, honestly, we could fix roads and bridges

514
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,680
and schools. Like, we could help people who actually need help.

515
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,600
We could make a difference.

516
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,970
You should do it.

517
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,020
Yeah.

518
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,150
Well, I looked into starting my own nonprofit watchdog group,

519
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,940
but start-up costs are prohibitive.

520
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,070
First step's always the hardest.

521
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,070
Yeah.

522
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,120
Is that why, back in the day, you and I never happened?

523
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,950
First steps were the hardest?

524
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,420
How much did you drink back at the hotel room?

525
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,460
Enough to ask you that question.

526
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,090
I mean, come on, Reacher. It's not like I didn't drop any hints.

527
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,430
I was your boss.

528
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,260
It wouldn't have been right.

529
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,730
Wow. [sighs] Well, I waited years for that answer, and it's pure Reacher.

530
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,360
Direct, honest and well-reasoned.

531
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,620
So, can I ask you another question?

532
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,370
What do you want to do about the two guys that are following us?

533
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,750
When'd you spot them? Ooh, when we left the casino.

534
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,960
Figure they saw us cashing out and now they're gonna try to rob us.

535
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,510
That's what I thought, too.

536
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,920
But see that car

537
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,340
parked up the street with the New York dealer tags? Yeah.

538
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,470
Pretty sure it was behind us on the expressway when we came into town.

539
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,930
Also, pretty sure when we walk by it, a man with a gun will step out.

540
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,230
Then, when we turn to run, the guys behind us won't be so far behind anymore.

541
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,810
So what's the plan?

542
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,770
We're not gonna walk by that car.

543
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,610
On my "go," over the fence.

544
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
Go.

545
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,490
Fuck.

546
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,910
Go, go.

547
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,500
Okay, there's got to be a warrant out for you in New York for hitting that cop.

548
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,050
We open fire in a residential area, cops get called, you get locked up.

549
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,510
Let's do this without guns.

550
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,880
Looks like they have the same idea.

551
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,970
Need help with yours?

552
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,060
I'll manage.

553
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,900
Damn, Reacher. When we were kids, we just wrote our names in it.

554
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,610
It's the Members Only jacket guy from the casino.

555
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,530
Oh, shit. If they went after us, they might go after Neagley and O'Donnell, too.

556
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,660
No, they waited until we were off the boardwalk to make their move.

557
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,500
They're not gonna go into a busy hotel with cameras everywhere.

558
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,580
No I.D.

559
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,130
Let's search this asshole's car.

560
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,890
Looks like someone did their homework.

561
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,070
Phone.

562
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,620
Is it done?

563
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,330
Not in the way you expected.

564
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,130
You're fucking with the wrong guy, Reacher.

565
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,880
You should know that this doesn't end well for you.

566
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,170
Then why are you the one that sounds scared?

567
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,010
Think I got his attention. Should we trace the number?

568
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,350
This is a burner. Guy on the other end will be using a burner, too.

569
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,150
Dealer tags are most likely ghost plates, VIN's been scratched off.

570
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,360
Nothing to I.D. any of them.

571
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,690
These guys are pros.

572
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,400
We should've left one of them alive.

573
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,280
Yeah, but they didn't give us much of a choice, did they?

574
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,740
Maybe not. Now we have nothing to go on.

575
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,870
Not necessarily.

576
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,710
Parking lot pass.

577
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,670
"New Age Technologies." Yeah.

578
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,460
Stamped yesterday morning.

579
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,250
I think it's what you call a clue.

580
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Now what are we gonna do about those bodies?

581
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,510
I have an idea.

582
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,030
I'm thirsty.

583
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,110
Want to get a beer?

584
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,170
Anything on New Age?

585
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,010
Yeah,

586
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,180
looks like New Age is an aerospace company.

587
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,890
Any ties to Atlantic City?

588
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,270
Not that I can see. Headquarters are based in New York.

589
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,190
Looks like a piece of shrapnel bit me. I didn't notice with all the adrenaline pumping.

590
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,400
Barely winged you.

591
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,360
Here.

592
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,250
What you doing?

593
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,290
What my mom used to do when the alcohol stung.

594
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,670
You know, you're probably just blowing germs into it.

595
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,970
Probably. But it feels good.

596
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,810
Thanks.

597
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,930
Welcome.

598
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,280
You know, Reacher,

599
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,660
it's perfectly normal to be lonely sometimes.

600
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,080
Anyone living their life the way you do would.

601
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,120
But you don't have to be lonely tonight.

602
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,920
And you're not my boss anymore.

603
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,240
All 650 will be in the truck.

604
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,700
You can track the shipment with the GPS locater I paired to this.

605
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,490
There are at least two good ambush points marked on the route.

606
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,490
Excellent.

607
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,290
My men will take care of the rest.

608
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
And the weapons?

609
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,540
They'll all be used overseas? I was told that was the deal.

610
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,790
Absolutely.

611
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,220
And the, and the truck driver won't be harmed?

612
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,430
Of course.

613
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,760
I would never harm anyone.

614
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,620
Morning, Dixon. We need to talk to you about what happened last night.

615
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,950
Oh, the whole hotel heard what happened last night.

616
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,250
Told you you were loud.

617
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,920
Found this in a car that followed us down from New York yesterday.

618
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,460
What happened to the driver?

619
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,920
He won't be following us back.

620
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,710
Neither will his two friends.

621
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,760
Shit.

622
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,350
Who is it? Wright.

623
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,850
Clear.

624
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,680
Come on in.

625
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,060
You, uh, you folks seem a little jumpy.

626
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,900
I mean, I don't blame you, given the circumstances.

627
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,530
And I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but when I was looking into things,

628
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,330
Atlantic City PD told me that two more bodies have been discovered in Upstate New York,

629
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,700
near where they found your other friend.

630
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,170
Judging by the decomposition, they'd been there a while.

631
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,380
Got a copy of the police report for you.

632
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,630
Pretty easy to I.D. him with that.

633
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,070
When he joined the Army, his sister was terrified

634
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,360
he'd be killed with some disfiguring wounds.

635
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,070
She'd never know what happened to him.

636
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,780
Said his dog tags could be blown off.

637
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,040
To calm her down, he got his name and service number tattooed across his back.

638
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,120
Looked ridiculous.

639
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,960
He didn't care.

640
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,290
He loved his sister.

641
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,130
I'm gonna have to call her.

642
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,130
I'll tell Milena about Jorge.

643
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,550
Their wounds match Franzy's.

644
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,550
Meaning he was tortured and tossed out of a helicopter.

645
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,850
Uh, one other thing.

646
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,360
Um, no one using any of the names you gave me have checked into any of the hotels in town.

647
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,280
And I talked to my counterparts at the other casinos.

648
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,110
Orozco and Sanchez, they weren't working on anything for any of them.

649
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,490
And when I told them about the $65 million gambling scam,

650
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,330
they pulled their overnight audits. I did, too.

651
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,710
Everything is within acceptable loss margins.

652
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,000
No one has hit any of the casinos.

653
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,540
You don't have anything to worry about.

654
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,710
Bodies were found in New York, car that followed us was from New York.

655
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,090
New York ghost tags, New York parking pass.

656
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,010
This has always been a New York case.

657
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,850
Where the hell are you going?

658
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,980
We're gonna need more guns.
