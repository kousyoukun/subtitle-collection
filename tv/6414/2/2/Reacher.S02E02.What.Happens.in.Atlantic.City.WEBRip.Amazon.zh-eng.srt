1
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,259
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,096
I got your message.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,348
110th, 10-30.
A distress call.

4
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:15,683
Calvin Franz was murdered.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,059
If he was calling you
for help, he may have been

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,686
trying to get in touch
with the rest of the unit.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,396
I called O'Donnell, Dixon,

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,148
Sanchez and Orozco.
No one's answering.

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,741
I paid off the concierge. He
I.D.'d Neagley as checking in.

10
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,785
Just keep an eye on
that hotel and them.

11
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,036
No one will really
know who you are.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,663
But you know.

13
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,963
Hey, O'Donnell.

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,590
Hey, Neagley.

15
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:49,967
Just a list of names,

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,968
all starting
with the initials "A.M."

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,428
I just got page after page

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,764
of random numbers.
No order, no meaning. Nothing.

19
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,557
At least
to us, for now.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,184
What
are you thinking?

21
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,560
I'm thinking there's
someone hell-bent

22
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,353
on taking out
the special investigators.

23
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,980
And they're coming after us.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,982
Good.

25
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,238
So, if someone's
coming after the 110,

26
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,073
how come they haven't made
a run at the three of us yet?

27
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,617
You were in the woods
with your family,

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,952
no one can ever find me
and maybe they just

29
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,454
hadn't gotten around
to Neagley yet.

30
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,122
They were in our hotel rooms,

31
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,957
maybe to grab us or take us out,

32
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,418
but then had to bail
for some reason.

33
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,420
We need to try again
to warn the others.

34
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,880
I'll call Sanchez and Orozco.

35
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,048
I got Dixon.

36
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,466
There's a black sedan
across the street,

37
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,135
couple houses down.
Same one as yesterday.

38
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:35,930
Guess you were right.

39
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,391
We're being followed.
How you want to play this?

40
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,477
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

41
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,779
Look at this fucking beaut.

42
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,950
What's he think he's gonna do?

43
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,086
Fucking nose, man.

44
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,257
Gun!

45
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,641
Just like the good old days.

46
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,520
Yeah, you on the sidelines
while I do all the work.

47
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,232
Uh, fellas, this was his gun.

48
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,276
NYPD?

49
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,570
Name's Gaitano Russo.

50
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,658
Don't look at me.
You did all the work.

51
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,622
Baby, oh, baby

52
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,875
Boogaloo down Broadway

53
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,167
Broadway, yeah

54
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,752
Funky Broadway

55
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,671
Baby, oh, baby

56
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,966
Got to say, man. Major screwup.

57
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,676
Soon as Russo wakes up,

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,928
the entire NYPD's
gonna be after your ass.

59
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,805
Why'd you got to
hit him so hard, huh?

60
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,473
I don't hit soft.

61
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,393
Well, a cop puncher's
gonna do some serious time.

62
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,520
I was pissed about
the dog, and I assumed

63
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,772
he was involved in
killing Franzy and Swan.

64
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:09,940
What did you teach us?

65
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,151
"In an investigation,
assumptions kill."

66
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,528
No, it was "In an
investigation, details matter".

67
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,864
I didn't kill him,
just broke his nose.

68
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,241
He'll be fine when he wakes up.

69
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,411
Shit. Gaitano Russo.

70
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,830
Guy Russo. He's the
investigating officer

71
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,583
in Franz's homicide.
I saw it in the files.

72
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,752
And how'd he get on your tail?

73
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,004
NYPD saw the calls
Franz made to you,

74
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,672
flagged your name, got an alert

75
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:34,798
when you bought
the plane tickets,

76
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,799
been on you since you landed.

77
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,426
Question is "why?"

78
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,011
Question is "where?"

79
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,804
As in, where do we hide
a six-foot-five felon

80
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,139
so you don't
wind up in the pokey.

81
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm not leaving.
The case is here.

82
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,477
Maybe not.

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,395
When I called Sanchez
and Orozco's office,

84
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,648
voice mail was full.
That's a bad sign.

85
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,608
So it might not be a bad time
to get out of Dodge,

86
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,611
considering Cocky Balboa
here just knocked out a lawman.

87
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,031
Fine. We'll head down
to Atlantic City,

88
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,991
see if we can find the guys.

89
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,952
First we got to
check out of our hotel

90
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,370
and find a more generic ride

91
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,121
before Russo
regains consciousness

92
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,625
and puts out a BOLO.
Range Rover's too conspicuous.

93
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,920
You're the reason
we can't have nice things.

94
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,315
Wait, I don't understand.
Was it a car accident?

95
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,192
No, he just kicked the car.

96
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,363
Well, then how the hell
did the airbag go off?

97
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,906
He kicked the car,

98
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,992
then he pulled the cop out
and he knocked

99
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,368
his dick in the dirt.

100
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,286
I'm telling you,
this guy's a beast.

101
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,747
When the time comes,
I'm gonna need some backup.

102
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,291
And you'll get it.

103
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,377
But for now, you just
stay on their asses,

104
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,671
and don't fuck this up.

105
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,464
Understood.

106
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,597
Short-term
airport parking only in Lot 1.

107
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,935
Short-term airport parking
only in Lot 1.

108
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,690
There's a 2019 Accord
for sale up in Tremont

109
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,526
for way under market value.
Cash-only deal.

110
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,069
One of the most stolen
makes and models

111
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,155
for sale in the Bronx, and
the guy wants no paperwork?

112
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,490
We sit in that thing,
we burn our asses.

113
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,868
We don't have a choice.
We're flagged in the system.

114
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,745
We can't rent anything
under our names.

115
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,954
Well, we drive around
in a stolen vehicle,

116
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,040
we risk getting pinched.

117
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,624
I've got our solution.

118
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,306
How was your undercover job?

119
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,142
Reacher.

120
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,104
How'd you know I was undercover?

121
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,690
Considering the circumstances,
you would've come right away.

122
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:57,983
But you didn't,
which can only mean

123
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,234
you didn't get our
messages until recently.

124
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,153
But if you were on vacation,

125
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,030
you would've checked in
with your office periodically.

126
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,908
So you had to be working
undercover, deep undercover,

127
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,744
where frequent check-ins
aren't always possible.

128
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,746
Same old Reacher.

129
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,790
Corporate embezzlement case.

130
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,291
Stuck in Texas so long,
I started to think

131
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,002
I actually liked cowboy boots
and high school football.

132
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,879
Still got your fake ID with you?

133
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,589
- Yeah.
- Good.

134
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,632
Use it to rent the car.

135
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,217
What's with all the secrecy?

136
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,135
Neagley, O'Donnell and I have
been flagged in the system.

137
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,137
And I punched out a cop.

138
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,140
Of course you did.

139
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,273
So... Franz.

140
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,818
Yeah. And Swan,

141
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,402
most likely.

142
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,197
Sanchez and Orozco are MIA, too.

143
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,618
Okay.

144
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,749
Okay, so we take
care of business.

145
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,335
You do not mess with
the special investigators.

146
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,046
Next.

147
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:06,802
Make sure you get an...

148
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,304
SUV. I know.
You need the headroom.

149
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,903
Good. Glad to see
you're still here.

150
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,655
Feel like I'm never gonna leave.

151
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,324
If it's reported at any Army
base anywhere in the world,

152
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,451
no matter how minor
the infraction,

153
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,995
we're copied on it.

154
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,956
Well, anything jump out at you?

155
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,126
Yeah, a rat the size of
a honeydew about 20 minutes ago.

156
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,294
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

157
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,628
It's back in
those boxes somewhere.

158
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,590
Gross. Well, speaking of rats,

159
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,633
I think I smell one.

160
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,886
A commanding officer
at a base in Afghanistan

161
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,971
thinks someone's
stealing aviation fuel.

162
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,849
Siphoning off gas to
resell it on the side?

163
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,809
Not exactly the kind
of priority case

164
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,477
the Army wants us taking on.

165
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,396
Right, but see, I don't
think anybody's stealing

166
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,690
and reselling anything.
Take a look at these numbers.

167
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,443
They always tell a story.

168
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,528
See, I noticed that
every time fuel went missing

169
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,740
from the base, it was always
after a specific flight.

170
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,784
Whenever C-17s ferried
Humvees back home to the States.

171
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,286
I mean, it's a minor detail,

172
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,164
but in an investigation,
details matter.

173
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,375
I like that.

174
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,252
I'm gonna use it.

175
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,129
What's mine is yours.

176
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,633
So...

177
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,635
you have a theory?

178
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,429
Yeah. There's been no indication
of black market fuel sales

179
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,348
anywhere on or around the base,

180
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,516
so how does all that
fuel go missing?

181
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,602
Best way to make gas
disappear is to burn it up.

182
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,146
Exactly. Now, Neagley's
got the bulk fuel experience

183
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,773
and she thinks all
the Humvee flights

184
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,983
are intentionally
being over-fueled.

185
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,236
But, when those planes land,

186
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,779
the amount of fuel in the tanks

187
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,489
is exactly what's expected,

188
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,907
and that gets
logged into the books.

189
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,784
So, how does that happen?

190
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,745
The excess fuel is being
used to transport more weight

191
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,413
than people realize
is on the plane.

192
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,207
- Yeah.
- Something heavy

193
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,834
and secret is being moved.

194
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,504
Mm-hmm. Exactly.
Contraband in the Humvees.

195
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,882
Drugs, guns, stolen cash,
all of the above.

196
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,135
Good work, Dixon.

197
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,471
You just found a case
worthy of our attention.

198
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,307
I don't know about you,

199
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,685
but all this sleuthing's
made me thirsty.

200
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,728
Want to go celebrate?

201
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,897
You can buy me a drink.

202
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,236
I got to keep working
on these reports.

203
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,447
Maybe next time.

204
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,157
Yeah.

205
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,993
But again,

206
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,202
excellent work, Dixon.

207
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,496
Yeah. No problem.

208
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,249
Like I said, numbers
always tell the story.

209
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,003
Best thing you ever had

210
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,265
Make up your mind

211
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,186
Decide to walk with me

212
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,400
Around the lake tonight

213
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,610
Around...

214
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,821
So, the numbers telling you

215
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,906
a story?

216
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,243
Yeah, and it's
a David Lynch film.

217
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,745
It's totally incomprehensible.

218
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,121
I mean, if these are
supposed to be fractions,

219
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,457
then it's sloppy work.

220
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,875
Some of them
aren't even reduced.

221
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,460
I noticed that, too.

222
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,628
Maybe the numbers
represent hard quantities.

223
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,047
Like, eight out
of ten somethings,

224
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,382
and not just
four-fifths of something?

225
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,717
Maybe.

226
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,677
Yeah, maybe.

227
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,471
Beyond that,
two things stick out.

228
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,139
None of these are 100%, meaning

229
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,558
there's no nine out
of nine or ten out of ten,

230
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,852
and the first four pages
have 26 numbers,

231
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,356
the fifth has 27 and
the last two have 26 again.

232
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,024
Could be an accident.

233
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,567
Just the way
the information's spaced.

234
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,028
No, seems deliberate to me.
None of these pages are full.

235
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,821
What about the list
of A.M. names?

236
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,531
Means nothing to me.
I agree with you guys.

237
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,116
It's got to be an alias.

238
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,203
Maybe it's someone with
a grudge against the 110th?

239
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,996
We've arrested a lot of people.

240
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,248
What about James Barr?

241
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,793
I mean, that guy's got
the skills and a screw loose.

242
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,003
Barr's a shooter.
Can't picture him

243
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,338
throwing someone
out of a helicopter.

244
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,673
Plus, I ran into him
in Indiana last year.

245
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,759
He owes me now.

246
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,721
I don't want to know.

247
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,644
Pine Barrens.

248
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,438
About a million lonely acres.

249
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,066
A lot like the spot
Upstate New York

250
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,859
where they found Franz.

251
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,113
They left his broken body
out there to rot.

252
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,658
For all we know,
Swan's out there, too.

253
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,745
And Sanchez. And Orozco.

254
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,791
Forever

255
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,000
There's no blues station?

256
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,878
Bro, we're in Jersey.

257
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,214
It's from my phone.

258
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,591
Franz used to blast this
at HQ all the time

259
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,094
when you weren't around.

260
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,345
I will treat you well

261
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,972
Leave it.

262
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,765
My sweet angel

263
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,518
So help me, Jesus

264
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,237
They rented
a car under a fake name,

265
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,698
but it's, uh, it's Karla Dixon.

266
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,241
She's with them now.

267
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,617
They're headed
towards Atlantic City,

268
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,286
probably gonna try to
find their missing buddies.

269
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,664
Good. All in the same
place at once.

270
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,542
When you get there,
take them out.

271
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,835
Copy that.

272
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,795
You remember what I said
about needing backup?

273
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,714
I know some local talent.

274
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,467
Well, bring in whoever you need.

275
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,844
We'll cover the tab.

276
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,889
I just want them
dead by tomorrow.

277
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,765
You hear me?

278
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,726
Fucking dead.

279
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,795
Just like Franz's office.

280
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,131
And our hotel rooms.

281
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,759
You said they hadn't
trashed Swan's place.

282
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,093
Yup.

283
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,261
Add that
to the list of things

284
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,639
that must mean something.

285
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,561
You guys ever know
Orozco to go anywhere

286
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,979
without his lighter?

287
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,359
Better days.

288
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,325
Am I the only one of us
that doesn't have this photo?

289
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,244
- Got mine.
- Got mine.

290
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,578
On my bookshelf.

291
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,374
Hard to hang a picture on your
wall when you don't have walls.

292
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,630
We're wasting our time here.

293
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,423
Agreed. We have
what the killers want,

294
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,094
and anything worth finding,
they already got.

295
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,679
Where to next?

296
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,639
A bar.

297
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,433
Look at these photos
of Sanchez and this woman.

298
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,143
Who under 50 frames photos?

299
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,728
We do.

300
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,939
Other than the 110th, how many
photos you have at your house?

301
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,148
Not many.

302
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,526
But she's framed,
so she's important.

303
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,029
We're going to the Lucky Lounge.

304
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,878
No. You two stay here.

305
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,172
You both look like cops.

306
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,425
What do you two look like?

307
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,176
Lady and the Tramp.

308
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,784
Hey.

309
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,620
This woman working today?

310
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,913
Who are you?

311
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,624
Friends of Jorge Sanchez.

312
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,085
Hey, Dulls.

313
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,047
These guys say
they're friends of Sanchez,

314
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,506
want to talk to Milena.

315
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,425
Take them back to the office.
She's doing the books.

316
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,302
Down by the courthouse steps

317
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,138
With a kiss upon the lips

318
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,143
But now that providence
has left the table

319
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,687
We're stuck with the check

320
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,983
Well, there ain't
no time to beg or borrow

321
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,985
Well, there ain't no
time for playing around

322
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,779
Milena.

323
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:50,617
Well, I'm moving on
to higher ground

324
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,286
Take your shit and
get out of here, now.

325
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,080
I get that he's
a different kind of guy,

326
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:58,333
but our commanding officer
buys used underwear.

327
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,297
Isn't that the girl
from the photo?

328
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,007
Oh, shit.

329
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,052
Hey!

330
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,846
This is as far as we're going.

331
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,938
What's going on, fellas?

332
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,481
You guys are gonna
stop coming around here

333
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,482
and messing with our friends.

334
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,901
Look, pal, you somehow got...

335
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,739
Don't touch me!

336
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

337
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,720
Move your ass.

338
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,139
I'm done, I'm done.

339
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,557
Well, it's a good thing

340
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,808
O'Donnell and I didn't go in.

341
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,893
Something could've gone wrong.

342
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,191
You making friends,
big fella?

343
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,653
I'm so sorry.
I never would've run

344
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:09,904
if I'd known who you were.

345
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,949
I should've recognized
you from Jorge's photos.

346
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,161
My guys were just
looking out for me.

347
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,663
Scary dude came in here
asking for her about a week ago.

348
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,915
Said he was working
with Sanchez and Orozco

349
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,208
on some big security job.

350
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,835
Broad-shouldered bald guy?

351
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,879
No. He had hair.

352
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,255
Scar down his cheek.

353
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,424
He wanted to know
if Sanchez had left

354
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,634
any kind of digital
storage device

355
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,927
with me. I-I had no idea

356
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,095
what he was talking about.

357
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,805
I got a bad vibe off the guy,

358
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,725
so soon as he left,
I called Jorge.

359
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,477
He didn't answer.

360
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,812
They've gone dark before,
part of the job,

361
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,024
but this... feels different.

362
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,525
Then you come in,
claiming to know Sanchez,

363
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,402
looking like the kind
of people somebody'd hire

364
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,571
to rough someone up. No offense.

365
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,989
Assumed you were bad news.

366
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,616
Do you
know if Sanchez

367
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,284
and Orozco had
any recent contact

368
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,786
with Calvin Franz or Tony Swan?

369
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,788
Actually, yeah. He was
here a couple weeks ago.

370
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,748
They hadn't seen
each other in forever.

371
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,917
I took a picture of them.

372
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,671
They were working
a case together.

373
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,756
Sanchez told you that?

374
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,757
Yeah.

375
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,383
What was it?

376
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,635
He didn't mention details.

377
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,011
Was Swan involved?

378
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,305
He didn't come down to A.C.,

379
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,517
but I heard them
mention his name.

380
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,727
You tried asking
Franz about this?

381
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,562
- We can't.
- Why not?

382
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,439
Someone threw him
out of a helicopter.

383
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,986
Oh, my God.

384
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,033
You think Jorge and
Manuel are dead, too?

385
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,911
We don't know yet.

386
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,871
If they're alive,
we'll find them,

387
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,206
but we need your help.

388
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,875
Is there anything else
you can recall

389
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,460
that you haven't told us?

390
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,796
Um...

391
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,506
I don't know.

392
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,259
Last time I saw Jorge,

393
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,302
he was sitting on
that stool right there.

394
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,098
He got a call.

395
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,432
Seemed important.

396
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,809
He say anything?

397
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,519
Kind of. He-he repeated
a couple of numbers,

398
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,896
kind of like he was
surprised by them,

399
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,232
or-or worried, maybe.

400
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,692
Then he said he
was going out for a while,

401
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,943
and he never came back.

402
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,403
Do you remember the numbers?

403
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,197
Yeah. He said,

404
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,616
"650 at 100k each."

405
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,826
No idea what he meant by that.

406
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,994
You're sure that's what he said?

407
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,539
I'm positive.
He said, "650 at 100k,"

408
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,875
he kissed me on the cheek

409
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,710
and he ran out that door.

410
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,591
You remember the last words
someone you love said to you.

411
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,677
Oh, darling

412
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,308
I need you close to me

413
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,562
We've got the numbers,
we've got the New York plates.

414
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,899
Maybe this isn't about someone
with a grudge against the 110th.

415
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,358
If you haven't noticed,
it's pretty likely

416
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,943
four of us have already
been killed already.

417
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,612
Milena said Franz was
here a couple weeks ago.

418
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,946
If the guys were onto something

419
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,573
that made them think
we were all in danger,

420
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,992
they would've called then,
not weeks later.

421
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,037
650 at 100k, we're
talking 65 million bucks.

422
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,496
That's a lot of black chips.

423
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,624
Most places. Not here.

424
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,169
Atlantic City casinos
rake in, what?

425
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,922
Gross gaming revenue's got to be
a couple billion a year, easy.

426
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,424
65 million, if taken carefully,

427
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,302
over time, could go
unnoticed for a while.

428
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,887
Not that long.

429
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,014
Not with casino accountants
watching the take like hawks.

430
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,807
But could the bad guys
hide it in the margins

431
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,059
long enough to get away with it

432
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,727
before the calculator
crew catches on?

433
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,396
Sanchez and Orozco do
freelance casino security.

434
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,065
I mean, maybe it all
started with them.

435
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,525
They stumbled onto something
big, they needed help...

436
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,570
So they reached out
to Franz... maybe Swan.

437
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,199
Guess this whole thing
could be tied to gaming.

438
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,618
I'm Ellie, I'll be your server.

439
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,036
What can I get you?

440
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,496
The casino's director
of security.

441
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,291
Now, please.

442
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,044
So, you're the 110th.

443
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,587
What's left of us.

444
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,382
Sanchez and Orozco talk
about you guys all the time.

445
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,925
Please.

446
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,218
So, you knew them well?

447
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,387
Uh, yeah. They would do
background checks

448
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,138
for all the casinos
on the boardwalk.

449
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,600
Hold on. Uh, you just
said "knew them."

450
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,686
Past tense.

451
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,521
We have reason to
believe they might be dead.

452
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,108
Oh, shit.

453
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,276
I-I just saw them,

454
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,947
uh, while I was picking up lunch
at White House Subs last month.

455
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,323
How can I help?

456
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,825
These numbers mean
anything to you?

457
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,411
Not offhand.

458
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,871
What about the phrase,
"650 at 100k each"?

459
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,458
No. Uh, what's this all about?

460
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,836
We think Sanchez and Orozco

461
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,131
may have been looking into
a $65 million gambling scam.

462
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,551
Okay. Uh, well, in that case,

463
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,679
your "650" could be
rigged slot machines

464
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,974
or fixed hands of poker,
but at 100k per hand,

465
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,393
that'd be incredibly
high stakes.

466
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,439
And I can tell you right now,
our books are on mark.

467
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,149
All right? We're not
missing a penny.

468
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,650
What about your competitors?

469
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,403
You know, I can...
I can ask around,

470
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,740
see if anyone knew what Sanchez
and Orozco were working on.

471
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,075
That might
narrow it down for you.

472
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,535
While you're at it,
run these names,

473
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,454
see if any of them are
registered at a hotel in town.

474
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,169
Uh... you know, this-this
might take a few hours.

475
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,670
Where are you guys staying?

476
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,756
Don't know yet.

477
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,842
Well, then, please, allow me.

478
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,135
Not necessary.

479
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,721
No, no. Any friends
of Sanchez and Orozco.

480
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,057
Well, it looks like

481
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,309
all we have available
is a suite.

482
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,227
I guess that'll have to do.

483
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,688
Come on, I'll get
you guys settled in.

484
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,273
We'll be fine at a motel.

485
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,650
Reacher, when someone offers

486
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,612
to comp you a suite,
just say yes.

487
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,697
Yeah. We'll have them send you
up a park bench to sleep on.

488
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,407
You'll feel right at home.

489
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,715
What was that
about a motel, Reacher?

490
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,762
Whoa.
I bet this place has a spa.

491
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,388
I'm gonna take a schvitz.

492
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,599
Ooh. Dibs on the ocean view.

493
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:16,270
Just waiting for you to
tell me it's time

494
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,734
I've been keeping
my head well-trained

495
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,654
Watching truth come
grain by grain

496
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:29,909
Just once I want to hear
that something is mine

497
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,911
Oh, tell me it's time

498
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:37,041
Time, time

499
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,710
Tell me it's time

500
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,130
Time, time

501
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,382
O'Donnell and Neagley
found the bar.

502
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,677
It's fully stocked.
Not for long.

503
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,178
You unpacked?

504
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,850
Yup.

505
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,900
I haven't
been in a hotel

506
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,069
that wasn't advertised as
"family friendly" in years.

507
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,362
I still
can't believe

508
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,406
David O'Donnell procreated.

509
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,992
On purpose, anyway.

510
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,077
Yeah, I seem to remember
someone bragging

511
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,787
that the only people
that would call you Daddy

512
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,080
were the women you slept with.

513
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,791
I still sleep with
people who call me Daddy.

514
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,252
Sometimes all three of them
if it's thundering outside.

515
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,297
You'll find out soon
enough, Dixon.

516
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,381
You're pregnant?

517
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,550
What? No. Shit no.

518
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,343
No, she's engaged.

519
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,970
What, you didn't know?

520
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,681
Someone finally lassoed
our little filly.

521
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,435
No, I, um, didn't...

522
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,728
Yeah. Well, about that,

523
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,355
you guys can,
uh, unsave the date.

524
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,733
Fuck. Seriously?

525
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,819
Yeah, I mean, you know me.
I've always been a numbers gal,

526
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,821
always had a life plan.

527
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:52,700
Plan said to get married at
a certain age, certain year.

528
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,119
And then one day, I see text
messages on his phone.

529
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:58,873
It says, "Hey, sweetheart,
can't wait to see you Friday.

530
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,041
I miss you." And all of that.

531
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,959
No. No one steps out on Dixon.

532
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,586
Not even
him, apparently.

533
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,379
Text messages
were from his niece

534
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,756
who was visiting.

535
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,050
But I realized

536
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,470
that when I thought
he was cheating,

537
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,013
I was, uh...

538
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,891
I was relieved.

539
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,060
I mean, he's a decent man.

540
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,062
I... I don't know,
if you're gonna spend

541
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,396
the rest of your life with
somebody, don't you want to

542
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,523
feel something more
than comfort?

543
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,359
I mean, don't you want
to feel excitement,

544
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,778
a little jolt of something

545
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,529
when you see him?

546
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,158
Anyways, you know, for a moment

547
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,494
I thought I was gonna get out
of it with no mess and no guilt,

548
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,704
but instead, I got
out of it with...

549
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,207
A lot of mess and
a whole lot of guilt.

550
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,959
Bingo.

551
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,752
Good for you.

552
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,170
Karla Dixon doesn't settle.

553
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,297
Thank you.

554
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,508
That's actually why
I took the undercover job.

555
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,010
Take a little time
away from it all.

556
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,137
Explain to me how
undercover work

557
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,806
and forensic
accounting go together?

558
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,517
Well, um, CEO
embezzling millions

559
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,227
from a company down in Texas,

560
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,979
where everybody's packing
some kind of heat,

561
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,563
and he was the kind
of guy to use it if cornered,

562
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:08,442
so got a little intrigue along
with the number-crunching.

563
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,195
All right. And what
about you, Neagley?

564
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,406
Every time I check my LinkedIn,

565
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,573
you're getting promoted again.

566
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,825
I'm having fun.

567
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,952
On big cases,
running a team now.

568
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,705
Trying to land this huge
software company as a client.

569
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,749
I pull it off, I get a taste
of that fat contract.

570
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,834
Making it rain.

571
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,419
No choice.

572
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,296
I really want to get my dad
on round-the-clock nursing care

573
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,965
and rent him a nice place closer
to me, but that takes capital.

574
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,842
Why rent?
Buy and build equity.

575
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,760
Get a condo.

576
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,929
Co-ops are fucking
banana republics.

577
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,307
Yeah.

578
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,225
What about you, big dog?

579
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,477
Being awfully quiet over there.

580
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,106
Home ownership is like
keeping snakes as pets

581
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,150
or ballroom
dancing competitions.

582
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,901
Fine, if that's
what you're into.

583
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,362
I just don't see the appeal.

584
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,947
Or the appeal of a steady job.

585
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,158
Corporate world doesn't
seem that different

586
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,952
from the Army, and that always
felt a little like a cage.

587
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,829
Just didn't know anything else.

588
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:06,000
Then one day I was in a bar,
and someone plays Howlin' Wolf

589
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,544
singing about trains
going by in the night.

590
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,130
That sounded like
real freedom to me.

591
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,967
Are you jumping on freight
trains like Boxcar Willie?

592
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,761
Sometimes.

593
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,637
Mostly I take buses
or hitchhike.

594
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,514
What kind of lunatic

595
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,683
is picking up the world's
biggest drifter?

596
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,727
They can be interesting.

597
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,103
Where do you eat?

598
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,521
I steal pie off windowsills.

599
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,231
I'm being serious.

600
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,401
Diners. Sometimes
people who pick me up

601
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,070
share a meal with me.

602
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,988
Sometimes I share with them.

603
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,782
Where do you sleep?

604
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,242
Cheap motels mostly.

605
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,619
And what if you can't find one?

606
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,330
Unattended boats in marinas
are good for a night.

607
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,998
Flatbeds of parked trucks.

608
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,417
Had a great night's
sleep in a hammock

609
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,002
I spotted in some
guy's backyard once

610
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,253
till the sprinklers went off.

611
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,922
Good God, man.

612
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,715
All you need is
a stick and a bindle.

613
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,218
Too much luggage.

614
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,805
Any more questions?

615
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,806
Yeah,

616
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,432
just one.

617
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,519
Don't you ever get lonely?

618
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,335
Looks like someone took the sign

619
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,129
as a personal challenge.

620
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,922
Doreen, I'm just warming up.

621
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,466
If you
liked the dinner,

622
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,302
make sure to try
Neptune's breakfast buffet.

623
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,888
Every day, starting at 6:00 a.m.

624
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,723
Thank you.

625
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,086
Looks like I'm not the only
one who couldn't sleep.

626
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,504
Numbers relax me.

627
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,797
Figured if I was gonna do math,

628
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,799
I might as well make
some walking-around money.

629
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,509
- Stand.
- Ma'am, you're showing ten

630
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:21,635
and eight on two of your hands.

631
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,721
That's right.
And I could double down

632
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,139
and risk it all
for a potentially

633
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,057
larger payout.

634
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,393
Or I could stand
and have a guaranteed win

635
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,687
because the next card out
of that shoe is gonna bust you.

636
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,564
My grandmother always said,
pigs get fat,

637
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,773
hogs get slaughtered.

638
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:35,900
She's no hog.

639
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,568
I'm no hog,

640
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,611
so I'm gonna stand.

641
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,738
As you wish. 15...

642
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,699
Too many.

643
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,659
Congratulations, ma'am.

644
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,661
You're having
a very lucky night.

645
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,872
Maybe you'd like to celebrate
with a concert on us?

646
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,165
Thank you.

647
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,459
Ladies of the '80s.
Debbie Gibson, Tiffany,

648
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,127
and Taylor Dane performing
their biggest hits.

649
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,837
If you hurry, you can
actually catch the second half.

650
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,339
But I'm having fun.

651
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,258
Ma'am, we know
you're counting cards.

652
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,427
Which isn't illegal if
you do it in your head.

653
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:06,138
But seeing that
your chief of security

654
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,473
was kind enough
to comp us a suite,

655
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,141
I'll cut you some slack.

656
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,643
Want to use those muscles

657
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,270
and help me carry these
to the cashier window?

658
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,439
And you can give these tickets

659
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:16,774
to the guy in
the Members Only jacket.

660
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,985
He looks like he would
enjoy some '80s ladies.

661
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,263
Thanks for coming with.

662
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,431
Late-night walks
always clear my head,

663
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,935
and after the text I got
from Neagley about Franz,

664
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,521
my head's been kind
of cloudy, you know?

665
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,939
Yeah.

666
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,607
I'm surprised you
can walk at all

667
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,109
with all the casino's
money in your pockets.

668
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,654
Can I assume the
forensic accountant's

669
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,573
gonna declare that
cash on her taxes?

670
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,199
Those crooks?

671
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,867
If there's anybody
I could audit...

672
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,287
Actually, it's kind of
my dream job.

673
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,414
Current gig doesn't
give you your auditing fix?

674
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,707
No, I'm just
busting millionaires

675
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,250
from stealing from billionaires.

676
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,585
What I really want to do

677
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,962
is go after government
corruption and waste.

678
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,589
Oh, you used to
work for Uncle Sam.

679
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:22,756
You know what I'm talking about.

680
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,216
$600 toilet seats.

681
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,761
Exactly. I mean, if tax
money was spent efficiently,

682
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:31,557
honestly, we could fix
roads and bridges and schools.

683
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,559
Like, we could help people
who actually need help.

684
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,686
We could make a difference.

685
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,146
You should do it.

686
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,231
Yeah.
Well, I looked into

687
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,692
starting my own
nonprofit watchdog group,

688
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,903
but start-up costs
are prohibitive.

689
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,324
First step's always the hardest.

690
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,994
Yeah.

691
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,247
Is that why, back in the day,

692
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,707
you and I never happened?

693
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,043
First steps were the hardest?

694
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,547
How much did you drink
back at the hotel room?

695
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,133
Enough to ask
you that question.

696
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,385
I mean, come on, Reacher.

697
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,928
It's not like
I didn't drop any hints.

698
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:16,268
I was your boss.
It wouldn't have been right.

699
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,817
Wow. Well, I waited
years for that answer,

700
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,278
and it's pure Reacher.

701
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,365
Direct, honest
and well-reasoned.

702
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,663
So, can I ask you
another question?

703
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,624
What do you want to do about

704
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,376
the two guys
that are following us?

705
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,920
When'd you spot them?

706
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,797
Ooh, when we left the casino.

707
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,215
Figure they saw us cashing out

708
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,716
and now they're
gonna try to rob us.

709
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,134
That's what I thought, too.

710
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,386
But see that car

711
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,096
parked up the street with
the New York dealer tags?

712
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,389
Yeah.

713
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,890
Pretty sure it was
behind us on the expressway

714
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,016
when we came into town.

715
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,143
Also, pretty sure
when we walk by it,

716
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,812
a man with a gun will step out.

717
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,105
Then, when we turn to run,

718
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,273
the guys behind us won't
be so far behind anymore.

719
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,900
So what's the plan?

720
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,985
We're not gonna
walk by that car.

721
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,404
On my "go," over the fence.

722
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,698
Go.

723
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,074
Fuck.

724
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,499
Go, go.

725
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,130
Okay, there's got to be
a warrant out for you

726
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,464
in New York
for hitting that cop.

727
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,091
We open fire
in a residential area,

728
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,135
cops get called,
you get locked up.

729
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,511
Let's do this without guns.

730
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,805
Looks like they
have the same idea.

731
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,684
Need help with yours?

732
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,185
I'll manage.

733
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,817
Aah!

734
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,114
Aah!

735
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,443
Damn, Reacher.
When we were kids,

736
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,777
we just wrote our names in it.

737
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,949
It's the Members Only
jacket guy from

738
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,451
the casino.

739
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,744
Oh, shit.

740
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,370
If they went after us,
they might go after

741
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,496
Neagley and O'Donnell, too.

742
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,123
No, they waited

743
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,584
until we were off the boardwalk
to make their move.

744
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,085
They're not gonna go
into a busy hotel

745
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,587
with cameras everywhere.

746
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,340
No I.D.

747
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,133
Let's search this asshole's car.

748
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,024
Looks like someone
did their homework.

749
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,820
Phone.

750
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,704
Is it done?

751
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,331
Not in the way you expected.

752
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,339
You're fucking with
the wrong guy, Reacher.

753
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,925
You should know that this
doesn't end well for you.

754
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,344
Then why are you
the one that sounds scared?

755
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,100
Think I got his attention.

756
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,935
Should we trace the number?

757
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,645
This is a burner.

758
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,314
Guy on the other end
will be using a burner, too.

759
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,108
Dealer tags are
most likely ghost plates,

760
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,068
VIN's been scratched off.

761
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,778
Nothing to I.D. any of them.

762
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,239
These guys are pros.

763
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,282
We should've
left one of them alive.

764
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,369
Yeah, but they didn't give us
much of a choice, did they?

765
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,705
Maybe not.
Now we have nothing to go on.

766
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,625
Not necessarily.

767
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,877
Parking lot pass.

768
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,463
"New Age Technologies."

769
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,632
- Yeah.
- Stamped yesterday morning.

770
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,342
I think it's
what you call a clue.

771
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,763
Now what are we gonna
do about those bodies?

772
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,516
I have an idea.

773
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,991
I'm thirsty. Want to get a beer?

774
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,677
Anything on New Age?

775
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,138
Yeah, looks like New Age

776
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,307
is an aerospace company.

777
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,809
Any ties to Atlantic City?

778
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,978
Not that I can see.

779
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:17,314
Headquarters are
based in New York.

780
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,653
Looks like a piece
of shrapnel bit me.

781
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,198
I didn't notice with all
the adrenaline pumping.

782
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,617
Barely winged you.

783
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,951
Here.

784
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,711
What you doing?

785
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:42,339
What my mom used to do
when the alcohol stung.

786
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,008
Mm. You know,
you're probably just

787
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,635
blowing germs into it.

788
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,720
Probably.

789
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,597
But it feels good.

790
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,019
Thanks.

791
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,648
Welcome.

792
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,909
You know, Reacher,

793
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,204
it's perfectly normal
to be lonely sometimes.

794
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,333
Anyone living their life
the way you do would.

795
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,546
But you don't have
to be lonely tonight.

796
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,051
And you're not my boss anymore.

797
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,264
There's no better time

798
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,641
To get a move on

799
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,729
A move on from you

800
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,025
Just you move on

801
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,199
All 650 will be in the truck.

802
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,825
You can track the shipment
with the GPS locater

803
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,368
I paired to this.

804
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:38,205
There are at least
two good ambush points

805
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,208
- marked on the route.
- Excellent.

806
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,251
My men will take care
of the rest.

807
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,879
And the weapons?

808
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,340
They'll all be used overseas?
I was told that was the deal.

809
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,217
Absolutely.

810
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,803
And the, and the truck driver
won't be harmed?

811
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,473
Of course.

812
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,767
I would never harm anyone.

813
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,869
Morning, Dixon.

814
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,496
We need to talk to you
about what happened last night.

815
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,957
Oh, the whole hotel heard
what happened last night.

816
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,667
Told you you were loud.

817
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,669
Found this in a car
that followed us down

818
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,420
- from New York yesterday.
- What happened

819
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,421
to the driver?

820
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,840
He won't be following us back.

821
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,426
Neither will his two friends.

822
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,512
Shit.

823
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,641
Who is it?

824
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,142
Wright.

825
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,771
Clear.

826
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,273
Come on in.

827
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,902
You, uh, you folks
seem a little jumpy.

828
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,905
I mean, I don't blame you,
given the circumstances.

829
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:56,241
And I hate to be
the bearer of more bad news,

830
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,368
but when I was
looking into things,

831
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,787
Atlantic City PD told me
that two more bodies

832
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,039
have been discovered
in Upstate New York,

833
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,583
near where they found
your other friend.

834
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,170
Judging by the decomposition,
they'd been there a while.

835
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,381
Got a copy of the police report
for you.

836
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,180
Pretty easy to I.D. him
with that.

837
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,737
When he joined the Army,
his sister was terrified

838
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,032
he'd be killed
with some disfiguring wounds.

839
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,992
She'd never know
what happened to him.

840
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,704
Said his dog tags
could be blown off.

841
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,914
To calm her down, he got
his name and service number

842
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,709
tattooed across his back.

843
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,170
Looked ridiculous.

844
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,796
He didn't care.

845
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,382
He loved his sister.

846
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:57,177
I'm gonna have to call her.

847
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,220
I'll tell Milena about Jorge.

848
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,473
Their wounds
match Franzy's.

849
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,559
Meaning he was tortured
and tossed out of a helicopter.

850
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,937
Uh, one other thing.

851
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:12,317
Um, no one using
any of the names you gave me

852
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,235
have checked into
any of the hotels in town.

853
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,197
And I talked to my counterparts
at the other casinos.

854
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,948
Orozco and Sanchez,

855
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,242
they weren't working
on anything for any of them.

856
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:25,455
And when I told them about
the $65 million gambling scam,

857
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:26,831
they pulled
their overnight audits.

858
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,291
I did, too.

859
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:32,545
Everything is within
acceptable loss margins.

860
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:35,006
No one has hit
any of the casinos.

861
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,007
You don't have anything
to worry about.

862
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,300
Bodies were found in New York,

863
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,386
car that followed us
was from New York.

864
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,097
New York ghost tags,
New York parking pass.

865
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,015
This has always been
a New York case.

866
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,024
Where the hell are you going?

867
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,570
We're gonna need more guns.

868
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,781
I know a poem

869
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,159
About sailors and whores

870
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:08,123
About how only one of us
started a war

871
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,583
This is tried
and this is true

872
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:14,045
This fox runs long
and this for runs true, hey

873
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:28,143
We were born by the desert,
we were born by the sea

874
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:33,106
Life of man is short
and that's okay with me

875
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,484
Broke my ankle in '85

876
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:39,237
This fox will run as long
as he's still alive, hey

877
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:53,751
It's every prisoner's duty
to try and escape

878
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:59,549
Except for prisoners of love
accept their fate

879
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,010
Upon this rock
I will build my heart

880
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,929
This fox will run long and
this fox will run hard, hey
