1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,250
《烈探雷彻》前情提要
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,090
我收到你的消息了
I got your message.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,340
110特别调查组 “10-30” 这是求救信号
110th, 10-30. A distress call.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,720
卡尔文弗朗茨被谋杀了
Calvin Franz was murdered.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,680
如果他给你打过电话 那他可能也给队里其他人打过
If he was calling you for help, he may have been trying to get in touch with the rest of the unit.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,140
我给奥唐纳 迪克森 桑切斯 和奥罗斯科打了电话 都没人接
I called O'Donnell, Dixon, Sanchez and Orozco. No one's answering.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,230
我买通了门房
I paid off the concierge.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,740
他指认内格利登记入住
He I.D.'d Neagley as checking in.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,780
盯紧那家酒店还有他们
Just keep an eye on that hotel and them.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,660
- 没人会知道你是谁 - 但你知道
No one will really know who you are. But you know.

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,590
- 嘿 奥唐纳 - 嘿 内格利
Hey, O'Donnell. Hey, Neagley.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,960
只是一个名单 所有名字的首字母都是AM
Just a list of names, all starting with the initials "A.M."

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,260
我刚得到的是一页又一页的随机数据
I just got page after page of random numbers.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,550
- 没有顺序 没有意义 什么都没 - 至少我们觉得没有 而且暂时而已
No order, no meaning. Nothing. At least to us, for now.

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,600
你有什么想法
What are you thinking?

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,350
我觉得有人一心想干掉特别调查员
I'm thinking there's someone hell-bent on taking out the special investigators.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,020
他们是冲我们来的
And they're coming after us.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,980
很好
Good.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,940
如果他们的目标是110小组 那他们怎么还没杀我们
So, if someone's coming after the 110, how come they haven't made a run at the three of us yet?

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,320
你之前跟家人在树林里 没人能找到我
You were in the woods with your family, no one can ever find me

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,570
或许还没轮到内格利
and maybe they just hadn't gotten around to Neagley yet.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,160
他们去了我们的酒店房间
They were in our hotel rooms,

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,160
也许他们是想抓或者杀了我们 随后因故不得不匆忙离开
maybe to grab us or take us out, but then had to bail for some reason.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,420
我们得再试着警告其他人
We need to try again to warn the others.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,040
- 我会给桑切斯和奥罗斯科打电话 - 我来联系迪克森
I'll call Sanchez and Orozco. I got Dixon.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
街对面几栋房子外有一辆黑色轿车
There's a black sedan across the street, couple houses down.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,460
跟昨天遇到的是同一辆
Same one as yesterday.

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,090
我猜你说得对 我们被跟踪了
Guess you were right. We're being followed.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,430
你打算怎么处理
How you want to play this?

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,310
我要去做个自我介绍
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,770
看看这个该死的美男子
Look at this fucking beaut.

32
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,950
他打算干什么呢
What's he think he's gonna do?

33
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,080
我他妈的鼻子 兄弟
Fucking nose, man.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,670
有枪
Gun!

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,590
就像过去美好的时光
Just like the good old days.

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,520
是啊 你在一旁观望 而我把所有工作都做完了
Yeah, you on the sidelines while I do all the work.

37
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,230
伙计们 这是他的枪
Uh, fellas, this was his gun.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,310
纽约市警察局
NYPD?

39
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,570
名叫盖塔诺拉索
Name's Gaitano Russo.

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,650
嘿 别看我 你把所有工作都做完了
Don't look at me. You did all the work.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,750
我得说 兄弟 你闯大祸了
Got to say, man. Major screwup.

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,170
拉索一醒来 整个纽约市警察局都会追捕你
Soon as Russo wakes up, the entire NYPD's gonna be after your ass.

43
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,970
你为什么下手那么狠
Why'd you got to hit him so hard, huh?

44
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,300
我出手从不手软
I don't hit soft.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,680
- 袭警可是要坐很久的牢 - 那只狗的事情让我很生气
Well, a cop puncher's gonna do some serious time. I was pissed about the dog,

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,480
我以为他参与了杀害弗朗茨和斯旺
and I assumed he was involved in killing Franzy and Swan.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,150
你怎么教我们的  “在调查中 假设害死人”
What did you teach us? "In an investigation, assumptions kill."

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,570
是“在调查时 细节至关重要”
No, it was "In an investigation, details matter".

49
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,280
我没杀他 只是打断了他的鼻子 他醒来时会没事的
I didn't kill him, just broke his nose. He'll be fine when he wakes up.

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,450
糟了 盖塔诺拉索
Shit. Gaitano Russo.

51
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,160
又叫盖伊拉索 他是弗朗茨谋杀案的调查人员
Guy Russo. He's the investigating officer in Franz's homicide.

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,750
- 我在档案中看到过他的名字 - 他是怎么开始跟踪你的
I saw it in the files. And how'd he get on your tail?

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,670
纽约市警察局看到弗朗茨 给你打了电话 标记了你的名字
NYPD saw the calls Franz made to you, flagged your name,

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,590
你买票的时候 他们收到了提醒
got an alert when you bought the plane tickets,

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,300
自从你落地以后一直跟着你 问题是 为什么
been on you since you landed. Question is "why?"

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,550
问题是 哪里
Question is "where?"

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,180
哪里可以藏一个近两米的重罪犯 这样你就不会被关进监狱了
As in, where do we hide a six-foot-five felon so you don't wind up in the pokey.

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,640
我不走 这里是案发现场
I'm not leaving. The case is here.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,180
也许不是
Maybe not.

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,970
我给桑切斯和奥罗斯科的办公室 打电话时 语音信箱已经满了
When I called Sanchez and Orozco's office, voice mail was full.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,140
这是个噩兆
That's a bad sign.

62
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,230
考虑到这位“拳王” 击倒了一位执法人员
So it might not be a bad time to get out of Dodge,

63
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,650
现在出去避风头或许不失为好主意
considering Cocky Balboa here just knocked out a lawman.

64
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,190
好吧 我们去大西洋城
Fine. We'll head down to Atlantic City,

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,990
看我们能不能找到那些人
see if we can find the guys.

66
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,240
首先 我们要退房 并在拉索恢复知觉
First we got to check out of our hotel and find a more generic ride

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,790
让警方“小心提防”你之前 找到更普通的交通工具
before Russo regains consciousness and puts out a BOLO.

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,620
路虎揽胜太显眼了
Range Rover's too conspicuous.

69
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,960
就是因为你 我们才不能用好东西
You're the reason we can't have nice things.

70
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,380
烈探雷彻
第二季第二集

71
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,380
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,310
等等 我不明白 是出车祸了吗
Wait, I don't understand. Was it a car accident?

73
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,230
没有 他就踹了一下车
No, he just kicked the car.

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,360
好吧 那为什么 安全气囊都弹出来了
Well, then how the hell did the airbag go off?

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,690
他踹了一下车
He kicked the car,

76
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,570
然后把警察拉了出来 狠狠地揍了一顿
then he pulled the cop out and he knocked his dick in the dirt.

77
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,320
这家伙就是头野兽
I'm telling you, this guy's a beast.

78
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,780
到时候 我需要支援
When the time comes, I'm gonna need some backup.

79
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,450
会给你安排支援的
And you'll get it.

80
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,710
但现在 你继续跟踪监视他们 别搞砸了
But for now, you just stay on their asses, and don't fuck this up.

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,420
明白
Understood.

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,130
机场临时停车仅在一号停车场
Short-term airport parking only in Lot 1.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,890
机场临时停车仅在一号停车场
Short-term airport parking only in Lot 1.

84
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,060
特里蒙特有辆2019款雅阁 正在出售 价格低于市场价
There's a 2019 Accord for sale up in Tremont for way under market value.

85
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,350
仅限现金交易
Cash-only deal.

86
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,280
布朗克斯区最常被盗的车型之一 他不想要任何文件吗
One of the most stolen makes and models for sale in the Bronx, and the guy wants no paperwork?

87
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
我们坐进去 就跟火烧屁股一样
We sit in that thing, we burn our asses.

88
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,160
我们别无选择 我们被警方标记了 什么都租不了
We don't have a choice. We're flagged in the system. We can't rent anything under our names.

89
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,160
我们开着偷来的车到处走 那很有可能被逮捕
Well, we drive around in a stolen vehicle, we risk getting pinched.

90
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,660
我有解决办法了
I've got our solution.

91
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,880
你的卧底工作怎么样了
How was your undercover job?

92
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,550
雷彻
Reacher.

93
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
你怎么知道我在卧底
How'd you know I was undercover?

94
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,770
考虑到当时的情况 你会马上过来
Considering the circumstances, you would've come right away.

95
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,020
但你没有 这意味着 你最近才收到我们的消息
But you didn't, which can only mean you didn't get our messages until recently.

96
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,070
如果你在休假 你会向你的办公室汇报
But if you were on vacation, you would've checked in with your office periodically.

97
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,200
所以你一定是去做卧底了 还藏得很深
So you had to be working undercover, deep undercover,

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,490
没办法频繁签到
where frequent check-ins aren't always possible.

99
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,910
你还是一如既往地厉害啊
Same old Reacher.

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,620
我在调查一起企业贪污案
Corporate embezzlement case.

101
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,830
在德克萨斯州待了很久
Stuck in Texas so long, I started to think

102
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,040
久到我都开始觉得自己 喜欢牛仔靴和高中橄榄球了
I actually liked cowboy boots and high school football.

103
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,670
你还带着假身份证吗
Still got your fake ID with you?

104
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,250
- 带着呢 - 很好
- Yeah. - Good.

105
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,880
- 拿它去租车吧 - 为什么要保密
Use it to rent the car. What's with all the secrecy?

106
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,840
内格利 奥唐纳和我被警方标记了
Neagley, O'Donnell and I have been flagged in the system.

107
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,170
我还打晕了一名警察
And I punched out a cop.

108
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,140
好吧 并不意外
Of course you did.

109
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,640
那么
So...

110
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,310
弗朗茨...
Franz.

111
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,390
是的
Yeah.

112
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,810
斯旺也凶多吉少
And Swan, most likely.

113
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,820
桑切斯和奥罗斯科也失踪了
Sanchez and Orozco are MIA, too.

114
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,320
好吧
Okay.

115
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,580
好吧 那我们来调查吧
Okay, so we take care of business.

116
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,330
不要惹特别调查员
You do not mess with the special investigators.

117
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,920
接下来
Next.

118
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,300
- 一定要租一辆... - SUV 我知道 你需要车内空间高点
Make sure you get an... SUV. I know. You need the headroom.

119
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,820
太好了 很高兴看到你还在这里
Good. Glad to see you're still here.

120
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,610
感觉我永远都不会离开
Feel like I'm never gonna leave.

121
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,110
如果世界上任何一个 军事基地报告了任何违规行为
If it's reported at any Army base anywhere in the world,

122
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,660
无论多么轻微 我们都得处理
no matter how minor the infraction, we're copied on it.

123
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,830
你发现什么特别的事了吗
Well, anything jump out at you?

124
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,910
是的 20分钟前 有一只蜜露大小的老鼠
Yeah, a rat the size of a honeydew about 20 minutes ago.

125
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,910
说真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

126
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,670
它又回到那堆箱子那边了
It's back in those boxes somewhere.

127
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,040
好恶心
Gross.

128
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,420
说到老鼠 我觉得 我发现了一只可疑的“老鼠”
Well, speaking of rats, I think I smell one.

129
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,970
阿富汗的一名指挥官 认为有人在偷航空燃料
A commanding officer at a base in Afghanistan thinks someone's stealing aviation fuel.

130
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,090
把汽油抽走 然后再卖出去
Siphoning off gas to resell it on the side?

131
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,390
这不是军方想让我们优先处理的案子
Not exactly the kind of priority case the Army wants us taking on.

132
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,810
我觉得并不是有人在偷取并倒卖燃料
Right, but see, I don't think anybody's stealing and reselling anything.

133
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,440
看看这些数字 它们总能说明问题
Take a look at these numbers. They always tell a story.

134
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,190
我注意到每次基地里有燃料丢失时
See, I noticed that every time fuel went missing from the base,

135
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,650
都是在一趟特定的航班之后
it was always after a specific flight.

136
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,820
即每当C-17 将悍马车运回美国的时候
Whenever C-17s ferried Humvees back home to the States.

137
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,240
我的意思是 这是个小细节 但在调查时 细节至关重要
I mean, it's a minor detail, but in an investigation, details matter.

138
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,540
我喜欢这句
I like that.

139
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,500
我会说这句的
I'm gonna use it.

140
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,080
我的就是你的
What's mine is yours.

141
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,170
那么
So...

142
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,380
你推测出来了吗
you have a theory?

143
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,300
是的 没有迹象表明基地附近
Yeah. There's been no indication of black market fuel sales

144
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
存在黑市燃料销售的情况
anywhere on or around the base,

145
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,470
那这些燃料是怎么消失的呢
so how does all that fuel go missing?

146
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,600
让燃料消失的最佳方式 就是把它烧了
Best way to make gas disappear is to burn it up.

147
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,020
没错 内格利有储藏运输石油的经验
Exactly. Now, Neagley's got the bulk fuel experience

148
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,350
她认为所有运送悍马的航班 都是故意过度加油的
and she thinks all the Humvee flights are intentionally being over-fueled.

149
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,230
但当这些飞机降落时
But, when those planes land,

150
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,360
油箱中的燃油量与预期相符
the amount of fuel in the tanks is exactly what's expected,

151
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,280
这些都被记录到账簿中了
and that gets logged into the books.

152
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,820
怎么会这样
So, how does that happen?

153
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,700
多余的燃料是在飞机运输不为人知的
The excess fuel is being used to transport more weight

154
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,450
- 额外货物的过程中消耗掉的 - 对
than people realize is on the plane. Yeah.

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,160
运输了一些沉重而秘密的东西
Something heavy and secret is being moved.

156
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,420
没错 悍马车里有违禁品
Exactly. Contraband in the Humvees.

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,670
毒品 枪支 被盗现金 上述所有
Drugs, guns, stolen cash, all of the above.

158
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,090
干得好 迪克森
Good work, Dixon.

159
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,470
你找到了一起值得我们关注的案子
You just found a case worthy of our attention.

160
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,970
我不知道你的感觉 但这些调查让我口干舌燥
I don't know about you, but all this sleuthing's made me thirsty.

161
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,890
想去庆祝一下吗
Want to go celebrate?

162
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,850
你可以请我喝一杯
You can buy me a drink.

163
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,230
我得继续处理这些报告
I got to keep working on these reports.

164
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,940
- 下次吧 - 好的
Maybe next time. Yeah.

165
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,990
但再说一次
But again,

166
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,660
- 干得好 迪克森 - 是啊
excellent work, Dixon. Yeah.

167
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,790
没问题 如我所说 数字总能说明问题
No problem. Like I said, numbers always tell the story.

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,610
这些数字跟你说明问题了吗
So, the numbers telling you a story?

169
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,570
是的 但这就像晦涩难懂的电影 完全无法理解
Yeah, and it's a David Lynch film. It's totally incomprehensible.

170
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,620
如果这些是分数 那写下这些数字的人就太粗心了
I mean, if these are supposed to be fractions, then it's sloppy work.

171
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,540
有些没被约分
Some of them aren't even reduced.

172
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,580
我也注意到了这一点
I noticed that, too.

173
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,620
也许这些数据代表数量
Maybe the numbers represent hard quantities.

174
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,130
比如 十分之八的某物 而不是五分之四的某物
Like, eight out of ten somethings, and not just four-fifths of something?

175
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,300
有可能
Maybe.

176
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,220
嗯 有可能 除此以外 还有两件事很突出
Yeah, maybe. Beyond that, two things stick out.

177
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,890
这里面没有百分之百 也就是说没有九分之九
None of these are 100%, meaning there's no nine out of nine

178
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,010
或十分之十 前四页有26个数字
or ten out of ten, and the first four pages have 26 numbers,

179
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,350
第五页有27个 最后两页又是26个
the fifth has 27 and the last two have 26 again.

180
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,560
可能是巧合 只是信息的罗列方式
Could be an accident. Just the way the information's spaced.

181
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,020
看起来是刻意而为之的 每一页都不满
No, seems deliberate to me. None of these pages are full.

182
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,860
那一连串AM开头的名字呢
What about the list of A.M. names?

183
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,150
没有任何意义 我同意你们的看法 应该是化名
Means nothing to me. I agree with you guys. It's got to be an alias.

184
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,570
也许是对110小组怀恨在心的人
Maybe it's someone with a grudge against the 110th?

185
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,030
我们逮捕了很多人
We've arrested a lot of people.

186
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,410
詹姆斯巴尔呢
What about James Barr?

187
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,700
他技术高明 有神经质
I mean, that guy's got the skills and a screw loose.

188
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,330
巴尔是名射手 无法想象 他把人从直升机上扔下去的画面
Barr's a shooter. Can't picture him throwing someone out of a helicopter.

189
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,710
我去年在印第安纳州遇见了他
Plus, I ran into him in Indiana last year.

190
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,750
他现在欠我人情
He owes me now.

191
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,720
我不想知道
I don't want to know.

192
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,680
“松林荒原”
Pine Barrens.

193
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,480
大约有一百万英亩
About a million lonely acres.

194
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,480
很像他们在纽约北部 发现弗朗茨尸体的地方
A lot like the spot Upstate New York where they found Franz.

195
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,150
他们把他破碎的尸体扔在那里 任其腐烂
They left his broken body out there to rot.

196
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,570
据我们所知 斯旺也在那里
For all we know, Swan's out there, too.

197
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,620
还有桑切斯和奥罗斯科
And Sanchez. And Orozco.

198
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,000
没有布鲁斯电台吗
There's no blues station?

199
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,870
兄弟 我们现在在泽西
Bro, we're in Jersey.

200
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,080
是我手机上的
It's from my phone.

201
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,960
以前你不在的时候 弗朗茨总是在总部大声放这首歌
Franz used to blast this at HQ all the time when you weren't around.

202
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,010
放着吧
Leave it.

203
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,150
他们用假名字租了一辆车 但是是卡拉迪克森去租的
They rented a car under a fake name, but it's, uh, it's Karla Dixon.

204
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
她现在跟他们汇合了
She's with them now.

205
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
他们前往大西洋城 可能是去找他们的伙伴
They're headed towards Atlantic City, probably gonna try to find their missing buddies.

206
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,660
很好 一个地方 一网打尽
Good. All in the same place at once.

207
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,790
你到大西洋城以后 杀了他们
When you get there, take them out.

208
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,870
收到
Copy that.

209
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,750
你还记得我说过我需要支援吗  我认识一些当地的人才
You remember what I said about needing backup? I know some local talent.

210
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,460
你需要谁 尽管带上
Well, bring in whoever you need.

211
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,960
我们会付钱
We'll cover the tab.

212
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,050
我只希望你明天干掉他们
I just want them dead by tomorrow.

213
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,970
听见了吗 让他们死翘翘
You hear me? Fucking dead.

214
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,780
新泽西州大西洋城

215
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,580
就像弗朗茨的办公室一样
Just like Franz's office.

216
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,880
还像我们的酒店房间
And our hotel rooms.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
你说过他们洗劫了斯旺的住处
You said they hadn't trashed Swan's place.

218
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,880
- 是的 - 把那加入事物列表
Yup. Add that to the list of things

219
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,510
一定意味着什么
that must mean something.

220
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,970
你们知道奥罗斯科 会不带打火机出门吗
You guys ever know Orozco to go anywhere without his lighter?

221
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,350
美好时光
Better days.

222
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,360
只有我一个人没有这张照片吗
Am I the only one of us that doesn't have this photo?

223
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,280
- 我有 - 我有
- Got mine. - Got mine.

224
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,570
我的放在书架上
On my bookshelf.

225
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,370
家里没有墙的话 很难把它挂墙上
Hard to hang a picture on your wall when you don't have walls.

226
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,380
我们在这里是浪费时间
We're wasting our time here.

227
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,300
我同意 我们有凶手想要的东西 所有值得找的东西
Agreed. We have what the killers want, and anything worth finding,

228
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,880
他们已经得手了
they already got.

229
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,130
接下来去哪儿
Where to next?

230
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,630
去一家酒吧
A bar.

231
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,430
看看桑切斯和这个女人的这些照片
Look at these photos of Sanchez and this woman.

232
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,520
- 五十岁以下的人谁还会裱照片啊  - 我们会
Who under 50 frames photos? We do.

233
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,350
除了110小组那张 你还有多少照片
Other than the 110th, how many photos you have at your house?

234
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,560
- 不多 - 但她的加了相框 所以她很重要
Not many. But she's framed, so she's important.

235
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
我们要去幸运酒吧
We're going to the Lucky Lounge.

236
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,570
幸运酒吧

237
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,290
不 你们俩待在这里
No. You two stay here.

238
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,500
你们俩看起来像警察
You both look like cops.

239
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,000
你们俩又像什么
What do you two look like?

240
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,170
《小姐与流浪汉》
Lady and the Tramp.

241
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,620
嘿 这个女人今天上班吗
Hey. This woman working today?

242
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,950
你是谁
Who are you?

243
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,330
豪尔赫桑切斯的朋友
Friends of Jorge Sanchez.

244
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
嘿 杜尔斯
Hey, Dulls.

245
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,290
这俩说他们是桑切斯的朋友 想跟米莱娜谈谈
These guys say they're friends of Sanchez, want to talk to Milena.

246
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,460
带他们去后面 她在记账
Take them back to the office. She's doing the books.

247
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,820
米莱娜
Milena.

248
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,320
拿着你的东西 立刻离开这里
Take your shit and get out of here, now.

249
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,950
我知道他不一样
I get that he's a different kind of guy,

250
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,040
但我们的指挥官居然买二手内衣
but our commanding officer buys used underwear.

251
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,090
- 那不是照片里的女孩吗  - 妈的
Isn't that the girl from the photo? Oh, shit.

252
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,550
嘿
Hey!

253
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,430
我们就只能走到这里了
This is as far as we're going.

254
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,850
怎么回事 伙计们
What's going on, fellas?

255
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,520
别再来搞我们的朋友了
You guys are gonna stop coming around here and messing with our friends.

256
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,900
听我说 朋友 你有点...
Look, pal, you somehow got...

257
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,030
别碰我
Don't touch me!

258
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,630
等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

259
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,630
走啊
Move your ass.

260
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,220
别再打了 我受够了
I'm done, I'm done.

261
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,300
还好奥唐纳和我没进去
Well, it's a good thing O'Donnell and I didn't go in.

262
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,350
否则可能会出岔子
Something could've gone wrong.

263
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,020
你在交朋友吗 大块头
You making friends, big fella?

264
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,980
抱歉 如果我知道你们是谁 就不会逃跑了
I'm so sorry. I never would've run if I'd known who you were.

265
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,110
我应该认出你们的 我在豪尔赫的照片里看到过你们
I should've recognized you from Jorge's photos.

266
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,030
我的朋友们只是想保护我
My guys were just looking out for me.

267
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,950
大约一周前 一个可怕的家伙 来这里问过她
Scary dude came in here asking for her about a week ago.

268
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,250
那家伙说他和桑切斯以及奥罗斯科 一起在做某个大型安全工作
Said he was working with Sanchez and Orozco on some big security job.

269
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,830
是个宽肩秃顶的家伙
Broad-shouldered bald guy?

270
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,920
不是 他有头发
No. He had hair.

271
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,790
脸颊上有伤疤
Scar down his cheek.

272
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,010
他想知道桑切斯有没有 留给我任何数字存储设备
He wanted to know if Sanchez had left any kind of digital storage device with me.

273
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,090
我不知道他在说什么
I-I had no idea what he was talking about.

274
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,970
那家伙给我一种不祥的感觉 他一走 我就给豪尔赫打了电话
I got a bad vibe off the guy, so soon as he left, I called Jorge.

275
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,010
他没接
He didn't answer.

276
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,020
他们之前也因为工作失联过 但这次
They've gone dark before, part of the job, but this...

277
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,020
感觉不一样
feels different.

278
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,730
你说你认识桑切斯
Then you come in, claiming to know Sanchez,

279
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,650
而你看起来像是被雇来的打手
looking like the kind of people somebody'd hire to rough someone up.

280
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,030
无意冒犯 我以为你不可信
No offense. Assumed you were bad news.

281
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,150
你知道桑切斯和奥罗斯科有没有跟
Do you know if Sanchez and Orozco had any recent contact

282
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,820
卡尔文弗朗茨或托尼斯旺联系吗
with Calvin Franz or Tony Swan?

283
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,200
他几周前来过 他们已经很久没见面了
Actually, yeah. He was here a couple weeks ago. They hadn't seen each other in forever.

284
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,910
我给他们拍了张照
I took a picture of them.

285
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,710
他们当时在调查一起案子
They were working a case together.

286
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,630
- 桑切斯跟你说的  - 是的
Sanchez told you that? Yeah.

287
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,130
什么案子
What was it?

288
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,670
他没提细节
He didn't mention details.

289
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,010
斯旺也参与了吗
Was Swan involved?

290
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,340
他没来大西洋城
He didn't come down to A.C.,

291
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,010
但我听到他们提到了他的名字
but I heard them mention his name.

292
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,760
你们问过弗朗茨这件事吗
You tried asking Franz about this?

293
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,600
- 我们问不了 - 为什么
- We can't. - Why not?

294
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,430
有人把他从直升机上扔了下去
Someone threw him out of a helicopter.

295
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,820
天啊
Oh, my God.

296
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,030
你们觉得豪尔赫 和曼努埃尔也死了吗
You think Jorge and Manuel are dead, too?

297
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,990
我们还不知道
We don't know yet.

298
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,660
如果他们还活着 我们会找到他们 但我们需要你帮忙
If they're alive, we'll find them, but we need your help.

299
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,410
你还记得什么没告诉我们的事情吗
Is there anything else you can recall that you haven't told us?

300
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,420
我不知道
I don't know.

301
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,550
我上次看见豪尔赫时 他坐在那边那张凳子上
Last time I saw Jorge, he was sitting on that stool right there.

302
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,470
他接了一个电话 似乎很重要
He got a call. Seemed important.

303
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,800
他说什么了
He say anything?

304
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,720
他重复了几个数字 好像因此很惊讶
Kind of. He-he repeated a couple of numbers, kind of like he was surprised by them,

305
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
或者担心
or-or worried, maybe.

306
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,980
他说他要出去 然后就再也没回来
Then he said he was going out for a while, and he never came back.

307
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,440
- 你记得那些数字吗  - 记得
Do you remember the numbers? Yeah.

308
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
他说
He said,

309
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,820
“六千五 每手十万” 不知道是什么意思
"650 at 100k each." No idea what he meant by that.

310
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,120
- 你确定  - 非常确定
You're sure that's what he said? I'm positive.

311
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
他说:“六千五 每手十万”
He said, "650 at 100k,"

312
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,710
他吻了我的脸颊 跑出了那扇门
he kissed me on the cheek and he ran out that door.

313
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,590
你会记得你爱的人 对你说的最后一句话
You remember the last words someone you love said to you.

314
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,600
我们已经掌握了数字 有纽约车牌
We've got the numbers, we've got the New York plates.

315
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,980
也许这事与痛恨110小组的人无关
Maybe this isn't about someone with a grudge against the 110th.

316
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,860
我们中的四人很可能已经被杀害了
If you haven't noticed, it's pretty likely four of us have already been killed already.

317
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,940
米莱娜说弗朗茨几周前来过这里
Milena said Franz was here a couple weeks ago.

318
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,360
如果某些事让他们觉得 我们处于危险之中
If the guys were onto something that made them think we were all in danger,

319
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,860
那他们当时就会给我们打电话 而不是几周后才打
they would've called then, not weeks later.

320
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,030
六千五 每手十万 我们说的是六千五百万美元
650 at 100k, we're talking 65 million bucks.

321
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,530
黑筹码太多了
That's a lot of black chips.

322
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,740
大多数地方 不是这里
Most places. Not here.

323
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,500
大西洋城的赌场大量敛财 怎么
Atlantic City casinos rake in, what?

324
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,920
赌场的年总收入应该是几十亿
Gross gaming revenue's got to be a couple billion a year, easy.

325
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,670
六千五百万 如果随着时间的推移
65 million, if taken carefully, over time,

326
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,300
可能会被忽视一段时间
could go unnoticed for a while.

327
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,010
不会那么久 赌场会计会像老鹰一样盯着
Not that long. Not with casino accountants watching the take like hawks.

328
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,760
有没有可能是坏人将其藏得够久
But could the bad guys hide it in the margins long enough to get away with it

329
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,720
在会计发现之前逃脱惩罚
before the calculator crew catches on?

330
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,310
桑切斯和奥罗斯科 是自由职业赌场保安
Sanchez and Orozco do freelance casino security.

331
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,940
也许事情是从他们开始的
I mean, maybe it all started with them.

332
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,560
他们偶然发现了一件大事 需要帮忙
They stumbled onto something big, they needed help...

333
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,570
所以他们联系了弗朗茨 或许还有斯旺
So they reached out to Franz... maybe Swan.

334
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,780
这件事可能与赌博有关
Guess this whole thing could be tied to gaming.

335
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,820
我是艾莉 为你们服务 你们需要什么
I'm Ellie, I'll be your server. What can I get you?

336
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,490
我们找安全总监
The casino's director of security.

337
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
请立刻带我们去吧
Now, please.

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,870
你们是110小组的
So, you're the 110th.

339
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,120
是我们组剩下的成员
What's left of us.

340
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,380
桑切斯和奥罗斯科总是提起你们
Sanchez and Orozco talk about you guys all the time.

341
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
请坐
Please.

342
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,960
你之前很了解他们吗
So, you knew them well?

343
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,010
是的 他们会对木板人行道 所有赌场进行背景调查
Uh, yeah. They would do background checks for all the casinos on the boardwalk.

344
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,640
等等 你刚说:“之前了解”
Hold on. Uh, you just said "knew them."

345
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
过去时
Past tense.

346
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,470
我们认为他们可能已经死了
We have reason to believe they might be dead.

347
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,430
见鬼
Oh, shit.

348
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,940
我上个月在白宫三明治店 吃午餐的时候还见过他们
I-I just saw them, uh, while I was picking up lunch at White House Subs last month.

349
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,450
- 我能帮什么忙吗  - 这些数据有什么意义吗
How can I help? These numbers mean anything to you?

350
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,240
就这么看没什么意义
Not offhand.

351
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,950
那“六千五 每手十万”呢
What about the phrase, "650 at 100k each"?

352
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,080
不知道 这究竟是怎么回事
No. Uh, what's this all about?

353
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,290
桑切斯和奥罗斯科可能一直在调查
We think Sanchez and Orozco

354
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,170
一起价值六千五百万的赌博骗局
may have been looking into a $65 million gambling scam.

355
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
好吧
Okay.

356
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,010
你们说的“六千五”可能是 被操纵的老虎机或固定手牌
Uh, well, in that case, your "650" could be rigged slot machines or fixed hands of poker,

357
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,510
但每手十万 那可是相当高的赌注
but at 100k per hand, that'd be incredibly high stakes.

358
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,310
我现在就可以告诉你们 我们的账都是对的
And I can tell you right now, our books are on mark.

359
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,060
一分钱都不少
All right? We're not missing a penny.

360
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,650
那你的竞争对手呢
What about your competitors?

361
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,190
我可以打听一下
You know, I can... I can ask around,

362
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,690
看是否有人知道桑切斯 和奥罗斯科在调查什么案子
see if anyone knew what Sanchez and Orozco were working on.

363
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,030
- 那样可能会缩小范围 - 你打听时 也顺道查查这些名字
That might narrow it down for you. While you're at it, run these names,

364
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,530
看是否有人用其中的名字 登记入住酒店
see if any of them are registered at a hotel in town. Uh... you know, this-this might take a few hours.

365
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,580
这可能要花几个小时 你们住哪儿
Where are you guys staying?

366
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,750
我们还不知道
Don't know yet.

367
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,840
那请让我来安排吧
Well, then, please, allow me.

368
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,130
不需要
Not necessary.

369
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,760
那不行 你们可是 桑切斯和奥罗斯科的朋友
No, no. Any friends of Sanchez and Orozco.

370
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,220
看来我们现在只有一间套房了
Well, it looks like all we have available is a suite.

371
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,890
我猜那也够了吧
I guess that'll have to do.

372
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,730
跟我来 我会安排你们安顿下来
Come on, I'll get you guys settled in.

373
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,140
- 我们去住汽车旅馆就行了 - 雷彻
We'll be fine at a motel. Reacher,

374
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,440
当有人请你免费住套房时 直接答应就好
when someone offers to comp you a suite, just say yes.

375
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,980
我们会让他们送你 一张公园长椅 让你睡觉
Yeah. We'll have them send you up a park bench to sleep on.

376
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,280
你会有宾至如归的感觉
You'll feel right at home.

377
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,840
雷彻 你不会还想住汽车旅馆吧
What was that about a motel, Reacher?

378
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,050
这地方肯定有水疗中心
Whoa. I bet this place has a spa.

379
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,840
我要蒸桑拿
I'm gonna take a schvitz.

380
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,720
这还是个海景房
Ooh. Dibs on the ocean view.

381
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,880
奥唐纳和内格利找到了吧台
O'Donnell and Neagley found the bar.

382
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,090
里面“库存”充足
It's fully stocked. Not for long.

383
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,550
不过一会就不够了 放好行李了吗
You unpacked?

384
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,220
好了
Yup.

385
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,520
我很多年没住过 没标榜“家庭友好”的酒店了
I haven't been in a hotel that wasn't advertised as "family friendly" in years.

386
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,690
我还是不敢相信 大卫奥唐纳有孩子了
I still can't believe David O'Donnell procreated.

387
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,240
还是计划生育
On purpose, anyway.

388
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,620
我记得某人曾吹嘘说 唯一称你为“爸爸”的人
Yeah, I seem to remember someone bragging that the only people that would call you Daddy

389
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,120
是跟你睡过的女人
were the women you slept with.

390
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,870
我现在还跟叫我“爸爸”的人一起睡
I still sleep with people who call me Daddy.

391
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,290
如果外面打雷 我还是跟三个一起睡
Sometimes all three of them if it's thundering outside.

392
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,170
你很快就会知道的 迪克森
You'll find out soon enough, Dixon.

393
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,960
- 你怀孕了  - 什么
You're pregnant? What?

394
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,590
没有
No. Shit no.

395
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,460
她订婚了 怎么 你不知道
No, she's engaged. What, you didn't know?

396
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,720
终于有人套住了我们的小母马
Someone finally lassoed our little filly.

397
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,800
不
No,

398
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,350
我不知道
I, um, didn't...

399
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,390
关于订婚那事 你们不必留时间过来了
Yeah. Well, about that, you guys can, uh, unsave the date.

400
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,440
好家伙 真的
Fuck. Seriously?

401
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,520
你了解我的 我一直是个数字女孩 一直都有人生计划
Yeah, I mean, you know me. I've always been a numbers gal, always had a life plan.

402
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,450
计划在一定的年龄 某一年结婚
Plan said to get married at a certain age, certain year.

403
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,950
然后 一天 我看到了他手机上的短信
And then one day, I see text messages on his phone.

404
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,370
说:“嘿 亲爱的 等不及周五见面了
It says, "Hey, sweetheart, can't wait to see you Friday.

405
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,490
-“我爱你”等等 - 不是吧
I miss you." And all of that.

406
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,000
没人能对迪克森不忠
No. No one steps out on Dixon.

407
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,540
显然他也不行
Not even him, apparently.

408
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,790
短信是他即将来拜访的侄女发的
Text messages were from his niece who was visiting.

409
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,840
但我发现当我以为他出轨时
But I realized that when I thought he was cheating,

410
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,090
我...
I was, uh...

411
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
我松了一口气
I was relieved.

412
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,760
他是个很正直的人 我...
I mean, he's a decent man.

413
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,600
如果你要和某人共度一生
I... I don't know, if you're gonna spend the rest of your life with somebody,

414
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,690
难道你不想感受一些 舒服之外的东西吗
don't you want to feel something more than comfort?

415
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,230
难道你不想觉得刺激
I mean, don't you want to feel excitement,

416
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,440
当你看见他时 有一点震动的感觉吗
a little jolt of something when you see him?

417
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,570
有那么一刻 我以为 我会平静且毫无内疚地摆脱婚姻
Anyways, you know, for a moment I thought I was gonna get out of it with no mess and no guilt,

418
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,700
但相反 我摆脱了婚姻...
but instead, I got out of it with...

419
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,160
却非常混乱 满满的负罪感
A lot of mess and a whole lot of guilt.

420
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,000
答对了
Bingo.

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,750
这对你来说是好事
Good for you.

422
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,500
卡拉迪克森没有安定下来
Karla Dixon doesn't settle.

423
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,330
谢谢
Thank you.

424
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,840
因此我接了卧底工作
That's actually why I took the undercover job.

425
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,050
花一点时间远离这一切
Take a little time away from it all.

426
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,800
给我解释一下 你怎么会同时当卧底和法务会计的
Explain to me how undercover work and forensic accounting go together?

427
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,060
首席执行官从德州一家公司 侵吞了数百万美元
Well, um, CEO embezzling millions from a company down in Texas,

428
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,600
那里每个人都携带枪支 如果被逼到绝路 他绝对会用武器
where everybody's packing some kind of heat, and he was the kind of guy to use it if cornered,

429
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,440
所以除了数字分析之外 还有一点吸引力
so got a little intrigue along with the number-crunching.

430
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,860
好吧
All right.

431
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,150
你呢 内格利
And what about you, Neagley?

432
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,990
我每次查看领英网 都看到你升职了
Every time I check my LinkedIn, you're getting promoted again.

433
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,570
我过得很好
I'm having fun.

434
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,990
解决了大案子 现在带团队
On big cases, running a team now.

435
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,740
我之前试着 跟一家庞大的软件公司签合同
Trying to land this huge software company as a client.

436
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,700
我成功了 从那份值钱的合同里面收获颇丰
I pull it off, I get a taste of that fat contract.

437
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,830
赚了不少钱啊
Making it rain.

438
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,210
我别无选择 我想给我爸请全天候护理
No choice. I really want to get my dad on round-the-clock nursing care

439
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,000
给他租个离我近的房子 但那需要钱
and rent him a nice place closer to me, but that takes capital.

440
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,880
为什么要租呢 直接买下来
Why rent? Buy and build equity.

441
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,840
不 搞套公寓 合作社就是他妈的香蕉共和国
Get a condo. Co-ops are fucking banana republics.

442
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,880
是啊
Yeah.

443
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,810
你呢 大狗狗 几乎音信全无
What about you, big dog? Being awfully quiet over there.

444
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,890
置业就像养蛇当宠物 或参加交际舞比赛
Home ownership is like keeping snakes as pets or ballroom dancing competitions.

445
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,770
如果你对此感兴趣 那没问题
Fine, if that's what you're into.

446
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,980
- 但我不喜欢 - 那你觉得稳定的工作有吸引力吗
I just don't see the appeal. Or the appeal of a steady job.

447
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,650
企业界似乎跟军队也没什么区别
Corporate world doesn't seem that different from the Army,

448
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,530
总感觉像是个牢笼
and that always felt a little like a cage.

449
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,950
只是不知道其他的事情
Just didn't know anything else.

450
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,620
我之前在酒吧里 有人演奏《狼嚎》
Then one day I was in a bar, and someone plays Howlin' Wolf

451
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,580
歌唱夜晚路过的火车
singing about trains going by in the night.

452
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,580
那听起来像是真正的自由
That sounded like real freedom to me.

453
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,920
你像博科思卡尔威利一样 跳上货运列车
Are you jumping on freight trains like Boxcar Willie?

454
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
有时
Sometimes.

455
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,760
大多数时候 我坐公交车或搭便车
Mostly I take buses or hitchhike.

456
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,720
哪种疯子才会让世界上 块头最大的流浪汉上车啊
What kind of lunatic is picking up the world's biggest drifter?

457
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,680
- 他们很有意思 - 你在哪里吃饭
They can be interesting. Where do you eat?

458
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,520
我从窗台上偷馅饼
I steal pie off windowsills.

459
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,310
- 我说真的 - 小饭馆
I'm being serious. Diners.

460
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,270
有时让我搭便车的人 会分享食物 跟我一起吃饭
Sometimes people who pick me up share a meal with me.

461
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,650
- 有时是我分享给他们 - 你睡哪儿
Sometimes I share with them. Where do you sleep?

462
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,200
大多数时候住在廉价汽车旅馆里
Cheap motels mostly.

463
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,660
如果你找不到汽车旅馆呢
And what if you can't find one?

464
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,410
停泊在码头的无人看管的船只 也很适合住一晚
Unattended boats in marinas are good for a night.

465
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,040
熄火的卡车的平板也适合
Flatbeds of parked trucks.

466
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,080
有一次 我在发现的吊床上 睡了个好觉
Had a great night's sleep in a hammock I spotted in some guy's backyard once

467
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,080
- 可惜洒水器浇灭了我的美梦 - 天啊
till the sprinklers went off. Good God, man.

468
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,170
- 你还真是一根棍和一块布就走天下 - 行李太多了
All you need is a stick and a bindle. Too much luggage.

469
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,840
还有问题吗
Any more questions?

470
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,720
有 只有一个
Yeah, just one.

471
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,760
你从来不觉得孤单吗
Don't you ever get lonely?

472
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,290
任您吃自助餐

473
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,290
有人把标语当成个人挑战了呀
Looks like someone took the sign as a personal challenge.

474
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,920
多琳 我只是在热身
Doreen, I'm just warming up.

475
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,590
如果你喜欢晚餐 请务必试一下尼普顿的自助早餐
If you liked the dinner, make sure to try Neptune's breakfast buffet.

476
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,840
每天早上六点开始
Every day, starting at 6:00 a.m.

477
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,760
谢谢
Thank you.

478
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,830
看来我不是唯一一个睡不着的
Looks like I'm not the only one who couldn't sleep.

479
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,460
数字让我放松
Numbers relax me.

480
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,840
如果我要做点数学计算 不如顺便赚点钱 我要叫停
Figured if I was gonna do math, I might as well make some walking-around money. Stand.

481
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,630
你的两只手上显示的是十和八
Ma'am, you're showing ten and eight on two of your hands.

482
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:27,050
没错 我可以加倍下注 赌上一切换取更大的回报
That's right. And I could double down and risk it all for a potentially larger payout.

483
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,310
或者我也可以叫停 保证能获胜
Or I could stand and have a guaranteed win

484
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,720
因为下一张牌亮牌时 你就输光了
because the next card out of that shoe is gonna bust you.

485
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,770
我祖母曾经说 “不可人心不足蛇吞象”
My grandmother always said, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

486
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,940
她可不是蛇
She's no hog.

487
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,610
我不是蛇 所以我要叫停
I'm no hog, so I'm gonna stand.

488
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,110
如你所愿
As you wish.

489
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,320
十五
15...

490
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,740
太多了
Too many.

491
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,910
恭喜你 女士
Congratulations, ma'am.

492
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,450
你今晚非常幸运
You're having a very lucky night.

493
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,200
我们想请你去听音乐会 庆祝一下
Maybe you'd like to celebrate with a concert on us?

494
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,040
- 谢谢 - 八十年代的女士们
Thank you. Ladies of the '80s.

495
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,120
黛比吉布森 蒂芙尼和泰勒戴恩 会表演她们最热门的歌曲
Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, and Taylor Dane performing their biggest hits.

496
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,870
你可以赶上下半场
If you hurry, you can actually catch the second half.

497
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,330
但我玩得很开心
But I'm having fun.

498
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,250
我们知道你在算牌
Ma'am, we know you're counting cards.

499
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,460
用脑子算牌是合法的
Which isn't illegal if you do it in your head.

500
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,680
但鉴于你们的安全主管 好心给我们安排了一间套房
But seeing that your chief of security was kind enough to comp us a suite,

501
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,720
我就放你们一马吧
I'll cut you some slack.

502
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,310
动动你的肌肉 把这些筹码送到收银窗口去
Want to use those muscles and help me carry these to the cashier window?

503
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,560
把这些票给穿着会员专用夹克的人
And you can give these tickets to the guy in the Members Only jacket.

504
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,060
他看起来很喜欢八十年代的女士
He looks like he would enjoy some '80s ladies.

505
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,090
谢谢你陪我
Thanks for coming with.

506
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,390
深夜散步总能让我头脑清醒
Late-night walks always clear my head,

507
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,470
我收到内格利发来说弗朗茨死了的 短信后 我的脑子就一直有点乱
and after the text I got from Neagley about Franz, my head's been kind of cloudy, you know?

508
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,520
是啊
Yeah.

509
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,730
我很惊讶你口袋里 装着赌场赚来的那些钱还能散步
I'm surprised you can walk at all with all the casino's money in your pockets.

510
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,480
我猜法务会计会在税款申报的时候 附上这一笔钱吧
Can I assume the forensic accountant's gonna declare that cash on her taxes?

511
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,110
那些骗子
Those crooks?

512
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,160
要是我能审计某人的话 那简直是我梦想的工作
If there's anybody I could audit... Actually, it's kind of my dream job.

513
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,240
现在的工作满足不了你吗
Current gig doesn't give you your auditing fix?

514
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,540
不行 我正在抓一个 从亿万富翁那里偷钱的百万富翁
No, I'm just busting millionaires from stealing from billionaires.

515
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,250
我想做的是追查 政府的腐败和浪费行为
What I really want to do is go after government corruption and waste.

516
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,380
你以前在山姆大叔手下工作过
Oh, you used to work for Uncle Sam.

517
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,250
- 六百美元的坐便圈 - 没错
You know what I'm talking about. $600 toilet seats. Exactly.

518
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,630
如果税收能被有效使用 我们可以修路和桥梁
I mean, if tax money was spent efficiently, honestly, we could fix roads and bridges

519
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,680
以及学校 我们可以帮助需要帮助的人
and schools. Like, we could help people who actually need help.

520
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,600
我们可以有所作为
We could make a difference.

521
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,970
你应该这么做
You should do it.

522
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,020
是啊
Yeah.

523
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,150
我考虑过自己成立非营利监督组织
Well, I looked into starting my own nonprofit watchdog group,

524
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,940
但启动成本让人望而却步
but start-up costs are prohibitive.

525
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,070
第一步总是最难的
First step's always the hardest.

526
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,070
是的
Yeah.

527
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,120
这就是我们以前 从没有发生过关系的原因吗
Is that why, back in the day, you and I never happened?

528
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,950
第一步是最难的
First steps were the hardest?

529
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,420
你在酒店房间里喝了多少
How much did you drink back at the hotel room?

530
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,460
足够我问你那个问题了
Enough to ask you that question.

531
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,090
快说 我以前给过你提示
I mean, come on, Reacher. It's not like I didn't drop any hints.

532
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,430
当时我是你的老大
I was your boss.

533
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,260
那样做不对
It wouldn't have been right.

534
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,730
我等了好几年才等到这个答案 不愧是你雷彻的作风
Wow. [sighs] Well, I waited years for that answer, and it's pure Reacher.

535
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,360
直接 诚实且有理有据
Direct, honest and well-reasoned.

536
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,620
我能再问你个问题吗
So, can I ask you another question?

537
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,370
你想怎么对付那两个跟踪我们的人
What do you want to do about the two guys that are following us?

538
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,750
- 你什么时候发现的  - 我们离开赌场时就发现了
When'd you spot them? Ooh, when we left the casino.

539
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,960
我以为他们是看到我们兑的现金 想抢劫我们
Figure they saw us cashing out and now they're gonna try to rob us.

540
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,510
我本来也是这么想的
That's what I thought, too.

541
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,920
看见停在那边
But see that car

542
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,340
- 有纽约临时牌照的车了吗  - 怎么了
parked up the street with the New York dealer tags? Yeah.

543
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,470
我们进城时 它在高速路上跟着我们
Pretty sure it was behind us on the expressway when we came into town.

544
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,930
我们经过它时 肯定会有个持枪的男人走出来
Also, pretty sure when we walk by it, a man with a gun will step out.

545
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,230
我们转身逃跑时 我们身后的人 不会离得那么远
Then, when we turn to run, the guys behind us won't be so far behind anymore.

546
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,810
计划是什么
So what's the plan?

547
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,770
我们不会经过那辆车
We're not gonna walk by that car.

548
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,610
我说“走” 就翻过栅栏
On my "go," over the fence.

549
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
走
Go.

550
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,490
他妈的
Fuck.

551
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,910
走
Go, go.

552
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,500
好的 因为你打了那个警察 肯定会发布你的逮捕令
Okay, there's got to be a warrant out for you in New York for hitting that cop.

553
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,050
如果我们在住宅区开枪 警察就会被叫来 你会被关起来
We open fire in a residential area, cops get called, you get locked up.

554
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,510
我们别用枪
Let's do this without guns.

555
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,880
看起来他们也是这么想的
Looks like they have the same idea.

556
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,970
需要我帮你处理你负责的人吗
Need help with yours?

557
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,060
我能处理
I'll manage.

558
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,900
该死 我们小时候 会把名字写在混凝土里
Damn, Reacher. When we were kids, we just wrote our names in it.

559
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,610
是赌场里穿着会员专用夹克的男人
It's the Members Only jacket guy from the casino.

560
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,530
妈的 如果他们追杀我们 他们可能也会去追杀内格利和奥唐纳
Oh, shit. If they went after us, they might go after Neagley and O'Donnell, too.

561
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,660
不会 他们一直等到我们离开 木板人行道才动手
No, they waited until we were off the boardwalk to make their move.

562
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,500
他们不会去 到处都是监控的繁忙的酒店
They're not gonna go into a busy hotel with cameras everywhere.

563
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,580
没有身份证
No I.D.

564
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,130
我们搜一下这个混蛋的车
Let's search this asshole's car.

565
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,890
看起来有人做了功课
Looks like someone did their homework.

566
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,070
手机
Phone.

567
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,620
成了吗
Is it done?

568
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,330
成是成了 就是跟你想的不一样
Not in the way you expected.

569
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,130
你惹错人了
You're fucking with the wrong guy, Reacher.

570
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,880
你应该知道你不会有好下场的
You should know that this doesn't end well for you.

571
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,170
那为什么是你听起来在瑟瑟发抖
Then why are you the one that sounds scared?

572
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,010
- 我觉得我引起他的注意了 - 我们要追踪号码吗
Think I got his attention. Should we trace the number?

573
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,350
这是一次性手机 刚才接电话那人也会用一次性手机
This is a burner. Guy on the other end will be using a burner, too.

574
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,150
临时牌照是幽灵车牌 车牌号已经被刮掉了
Dealer tags are most likely ghost plates, VIN's been scratched off.

575
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,360
没什么能指认他们身份的东西
Nothing to I.D. any of them.

576
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,690
这些人都是专业杀手
These guys are pros.

577
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,400
我们应该留个活口的
We should've left one of them alive.

578
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,280
是啊 他们没给我们很多选择
Yeah, but they didn't give us much of a choice, did they?

579
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,740
也许没有 现在我们的线索断了
Maybe not. Now we have nothing to go on.

580
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,870
不一定
Not necessarily.

581
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,710
停车场通行证
Parking lot pass.

582
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,670
-“新时代科技” - 对
"New Age Technologies." Yeah.

583
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,460
昨天早上盖的章
Stamped yesterday morning.

584
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,250
这就是你口中的线索
I think it's what you call a clue.

585
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
我们怎么处理尸体
Now what are we gonna do about those bodies?

586
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,510
我有个主意
I have an idea.

587
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,030
我口渴了
I'm thirsty.

588
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,110
想喝啤酒吗
Want to get a beer?

589
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,170
新时代有什么发现吗
Anything on New Age?

590
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,010
有
Yeah,

591
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,180
看起来新时代是一家航空航天公司
looks like New Age is an aerospace company.

592
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,890
跟大西洋城有联系吗
Any ties to Atlantic City?

593
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,270
我看没有 它的总部设在纽约
Not that I can see. Headquarters are based in New York.

594
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,190
有一块弹片打中我了 刚才太过刺激 我没注意
Looks like a piece of shrapnel bit me. I didn't notice with all the adrenaline pumping.

595
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,400
几乎没伤到你
Barely winged you.

596
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,360
这里...
Here.

597
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,250
你在干什么
What you doing?

598
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,290
给伤口抹酒精很疼 我妈以前就这么做
What my mom used to do when the alcohol stung.

599
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,670
你可能只把细菌吹进去了
You know, you're probably just blowing germs into it.

600
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,970
可能吧 但感觉很好
Probably. But it feels good.

601
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,810
谢谢
Thanks.

602
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,930
不用谢
Welcome.

603
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,280
你知道 雷彻
You know, Reacher,

604
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,660
有时感觉孤单是很正常的
it's perfectly normal to be lonely sometimes.

605
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,080
任何人像你这么过日子都会孤单
Anyone living their life the way you do would.

606
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,120
今晚你不必孤单
But you don't have to be lonely tonight.

607
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,920
而且你也不再是我的老大了
And you're not my boss anymore.

608
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,710
科罗拉多州丹佛市外32公里处

609
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,240
所有六千五百万都将装在卡车里
All 650 will be in the truck.

610
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,700
你可以用我在车上 装的GPS定位器追踪
You can track the shipment with the GPS locater I paired to this.

611
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,490
路上至少标记了两个好的伏击点
There are at least two good ambush points marked on the route.

612
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,490
很好
Excellent.

613
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,290
我的人会处理剩下的事
My men will take care of the rest.

614
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
那武器呢
And the weapons?

615
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,540
都会在海外使用吗 这是说好了的
They'll all be used overseas? I was told that was the deal.

616
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,790
那当然
Absolutely.

617
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,220
卡车司机不会受到伤害吧
And the, and the truck driver won't be harmed?

618
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,430
当然
Of course.

619
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,760
我永远不会伤害任何人
I would never harm anyone.

620
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,620
- 早上好 迪克森 - 我们需要谈谈昨晚的事
Morning, Dixon. We need to talk to you about what happened last night.

621
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,950
整个酒店都听到昨天的动静了
Oh, the whole hotel heard what happened last night.

622
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,250
我就说你声音很大
Told you you were loud.

623
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,920
这是昨天在从纽约就开始 跟踪我们的车里找到的
Found this in a car that followed us down from New York yesterday.

624
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,460
司机怎么了
What happened to the driver?

625
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,920
他不会跟我们回去
He won't be following us back.

626
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,710
他的那两个朋友也不会
Neither will his two friends.

627
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,760
妈的
Shit.

628
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,350
- 是谁  - 赖特
Who is it? Wright.

629
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,850
安全
Clear.

630
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,680
进来
Come on in.

631
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,060
你们看起来有点紧张啊
You, uh, you folks seem a little jumpy.

632
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,900
鉴于目前的情况 我不能怪你们
I mean, I don't blame you, given the circumstances.

633
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,530
我很讨厌传达更多坏消息 但我调查这些事情时
And I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but when I was looking into things,

634
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,330
大西洋城警察局跟我说 他们在纽约北部发现了两具尸体
Atlantic City PD told me that two more bodies have been discovered in Upstate New York,

635
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,700
就在他们发现你们朋友的地方附近
near where they found your other friend.

636
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,170
从分解情况来看 他们已经在那儿有段时间了
Judging by the decomposition, they'd been there a while.

637
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,380
我拿到了一份警察报告副本
Got a copy of the police report for you.

638
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,630
很容易借此识别其身份
Pretty easy to I.D. him with that.

639
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,070
他参军时 他姐姐很害怕
When he joined the Army, his sister was terrified

640
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,360
他会伤痕累累地死去
he'd be killed with some disfiguring wounds.

641
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,070
她永远不会知道发生了什么
She'd never know what happened to him.

642
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,780
就说他的兵牌可能被炸掉
Said his dog tags could be blown off.

643
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,040
为了安抚她 他在后背上 文了他的名字和服役编号
To calm her down, he got his name and service number tattooed across his back.

644
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,120
看起来很可笑
Looked ridiculous.

645
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,960
他不在乎
He didn't care.

646
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,290
他爱他的姐姐
He loved his sister.

647
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,130
我得给她打电话
I'm gonna have to call her.

648
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,130
我会告诉米莱娜豪尔赫的遭遇
I'll tell Milena about Jorge.

649
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,550
他们的伤口跟弗朗茨的吻合
Their wounds match Franzy's.

650
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,550
这意味着他受到了折磨 然后被扔下了直升机
Meaning he was tortured and tossed out of a helicopter.

651
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,850
