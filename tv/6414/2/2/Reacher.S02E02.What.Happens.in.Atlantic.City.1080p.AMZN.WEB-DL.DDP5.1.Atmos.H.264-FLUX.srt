1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,289
<i>Previously on Reacher...</i>

2
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:12,070
I got your message.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,330
110th, 10-30. A distress call.

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,660
Calvin Franz was murdered.

5
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,216
If he was calling you for
help, he may have been

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,835
trying to get in touch
with the rest of the unit.

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,370
I called O'Donnell, Dixon,

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,179
Sanchez and Orozco.
No one's answering.

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,719
I paid off the concierge. He
I.D.'d Neagley as checking in.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,759
Just keep an eye on
that hotel and them.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,185
No one will really
know who you are.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,700
But you know.

13
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,939
Hey, O'Donnell.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,630
Hey, Neagley.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Just a list of names,

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,950
all starting with
the initials "A.M."

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,409
I just got page after page

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,740
of random numbers. No
order, no meaning. Nothing.

19
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,530
At least to us, for now.

20
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,159
What are you thinking?

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,716
I'm thinking there's
someone hell-bent

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,329
on taking out the
special investigators.

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,960
And they're coming after us.

24
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,019
Good.

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,219
So, if someone's
coming after the 110,

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,225
how come they haven't made
a run at the three of us yet?

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,766
You were in the
woods with your family,

28
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,930
no one can ever find
me and maybe they just

29
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:18,530
hadn't gotten around
to Neagley yet.

30
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,099
They were in our hotel rooms,

31
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,930
maybe to grab us or take us out,

32
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,400
but then had to bail
for some reason.

33
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,400
We need to try again
to warn the others.

34
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,859
I'll call Sanchez and Orozco.

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
I got Dixon.

36
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,615
There's a black sedan
across the street,

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,170
couple houses down.
Same one as yesterday.

38
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,909
Guess you were right.

39
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:39,370
We're being followed.
How you want to play this?

40
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,509
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

41
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,810
Look at this fucking beaut.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,990
What's he think he's gonna do?

43
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,120
Fucking nose, man.

44
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,289
Gun!

45
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,620
Just like the good old days.

46
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,500
Yeah, you on the sidelines
while I do all the work.

47
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:28,270
Uh, fellas, this was his gun.

48
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,610
Name's Gaitano Russo.

49
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,689
Don't look at me.
You did all the work.

50
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,939
Got to say, man. Major screwup.

51
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,650
Soon as Russo wakes up,

52
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,909
the entire NYPD's
gonna be after your ass.

53
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,780
Why'd you got to
hit him so hard, huh?

54
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,449
I don't hit soft.

55
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,370
Well, a cop puncher's
gonna do some serious time.

56
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,500
I was pissed about
the dog, and I assumed

57
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,750
he was involved in
killing Franzy and Swan.

58
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:09,949
What did you teach us?

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,129
"In an investigation,
assumptions kill."

60
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,509
No, it was "In an
investigation, details matter".

61
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,840
I didn't kill him,
just broke his nose.

62
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,219
He'll be fine when he wakes up.

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,389
Shit. Gaitano Russo.

64
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,810
Guy Russo. He's the
investigating officer

65
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,560
in Franz's homicide.
I saw it in the files.

66
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,729
And how'd he get on your tail?

67
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,979
NYPD saw the calls
Franz made to you,

68
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,650
flagged your name, got an alert

69
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:34,956
when you bought
the plane tickets,

70
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:35,780
been on you since you landed.

71
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,400
Question is "why?"

72
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,990
Question is "where?"

73
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,949
As in, where do we
hide a six-foot-five felon

74
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,295
so you don't wind
up in the pokey.

75
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,579
I'm not leaving.
The case is here.

76
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,449
Maybe not.

77
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,370
When I called Sanchez
and Orozco's office,

78
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,629
voice mail was full.
That's a bad sign.

79
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,756
So it might not be a bad
time to get out of Dodge,

80
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,590
considering Cocky Balboa
here just knocked out a lawman.

81
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,009
Fine. We'll head
down to Atlantic City,

82
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,969
see if we can find the guys.

83
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,930
First we got to
check out of our hotel

84
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,349
and find a more generic ride

85
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,099
before Russo
regains consciousness

86
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,659
and puts out a BOLO. Range
Rover's too conspicuous.

87
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,960
You're the reason we
can't have nice things.

88
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,290
Wait, I don't understand.
Was it a car accident?

89
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,170
No, he just kicked the car.

90
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,340
Well, then how the hell
did the airbag go off?

91
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,879
He kicked the car,

92
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,970
then he pulled the
cop out and he knocked

93
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,350
<i>his dick in the dirt.</i>

94
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,259
<i>I'm telling you,
this guy's a beast.</i>

95
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,720
When the time comes, I'm
gonna need some backup.

96
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,269
And you'll get it.

97
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,350
But for now, you just
stay on their asses,

98
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,649
and don't fuck this up.

99
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,500
Understood.

100
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,629
<i>Short-term airport
parking only in Lot 1.</i>

101
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,970
<i>Short-term airport
parking only in Lot 1.</i>

102
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,670
There's a 2019 Accord
for sale up in Tremont

103
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,500
for way under market
value. Cash-only deal.

104
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,220
One of the most stolen
makes and models

105
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,305
for sale in the Bronx, and
the guy wants no paperwork?

106
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,470
We sit in that thing,
we burn our asses.

107
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,850
We don't have a choice.
We're flagged in the system.

108
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,720
We can't rent anything
under our names.

109
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,105
Well, we drive around
in a stolen vehicle,

110
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,019
we risk getting pinched.

111
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,659
I've got our solution.

112
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,340
How was your undercover job?

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,180
Reacher.

114
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,079
How'd you know I was undercover?

115
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,670
Considering the circumstances,
you would've come right away.

116
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,136
But you didn't,
which can only mean

117
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,386
you didn't get our
messages until recently.

118
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,129
But if you were on vacation,

119
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,185
you would've checked in
with your office periodically.

120
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,889
So you had to be working
undercover, deep undercover,

121
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,720
where frequent check-ins
aren't always possible.

122
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,720
Same old Reacher.

123
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,769
Corporate embezzlement case.

124
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,446
Stuck in Texas so
long, I started to think

125
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,980
I actually liked cowboy
boots and high school football.

126
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,860
Still got your fake ID with you?

127
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,569
- Yeah.
- Good.

128
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:21,769
Use it to rent the car.

129
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,189
What's with all the secrecy?

130
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,286
Neagley, O'Donnell and I
have been flagged in the system.

131
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,110
And I punched out a cop.

132
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,180
Of course you did.

133
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,250
So... Franz.

134
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,800
Yeah. And Swan,

135
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,379
most likely.

136
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:45,170
Sanchez and Orozco are MIA, too.

137
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,649
Okay.

138
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,730
Okay, so we take
care of business.

139
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,370
You do not mess with
the special investigators.

140
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,079
Next.

141
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,879
Make sure you get an...

142
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,339
SUV. I know. You
need the headroom.

143
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:24,879
Good. Glad to
see you're still here.

144
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,629
Feel like I'm never gonna leave.

145
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,300
If it's reported at any Army
base anywhere in the world,

146
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,430
no matter how
minor the infraction,

147
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,029
we're copied on it.

148
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,930
Well, anything jump out at you?

149
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:39,100
Yeah, a rat the size of a
honeydew about 20 minutes ago.

150
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

151
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,786
It's back in those
boxes somewhere.

152
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,569
Gross. Well, speaking of rats,

153
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,610
I think I smell one.

154
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,860
A commanding officer
at a base in Afghanistan

155
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,949
thinks someone's
stealing aviation fuel.

156
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,829
Siphoning off gas to
resell it on the side?

157
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:55,790
Not exactly the
kind of priority case

158
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,449
the Army wants us taking on.

159
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,529
Right, but see, I don't
think anybody's stealing

160
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,670
and reselling anything.
Take a look at these numbers.

161
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,420
They always tell a story.

162
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,509
See, I noticed that every
time fuel went missing

163
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,720
from the base, it was
always after a specific flight.

164
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,759
Whenever C-17s ferried
Humvees back home to the States.

165
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,259
I mean, it's a minor detail,

166
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,199
but in an investigation,
details matter.

167
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,350
I like that.

168
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,230
I'm gonna use it.

169
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,160
What's mine is yours.

170
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,610
So...

171
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,610
you have a theory?

172
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,409
Yeah. There's been no
indication of black market fuel sales

173
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,330
anywhere on or around the base,

174
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,490
so how does all
that fuel go missing?

175
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,580
Best way to make gas
disappear is to burn it up.

176
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,120
Exactly. Now, Neagley's
got the bulk fuel experience

177
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,759
and she thinks all
the Humvee flights

178
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,960
are intentionally
being over-fueled.

179
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,210
But, when those planes land,

180
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,759
the amount of fuel in the tanks

181
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,470
is exactly what's expected,

182
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,056
and that gets
logged into the books.

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,759
So, how does that happen?

184
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,720
The excess fuel is being
used to transport more weight

185
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,389
than people realize
is on the plane.

186
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,179
- Yeah.
- Something heavy

187
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,809
and secret is being moved.

188
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,480
Mm-hmm. Exactly.
Contraband in the Humvees.

189
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,919
Drugs, guns, stolen
cash, all of the above.

190
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,110
Good work, Dixon.

191
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:14,509
You just found a case
worthy of our attention.

192
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,279
I don't know about you,

193
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,659
but all this sleuthing's
made me thirsty.

194
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,710
Want to go celebrate?

195
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,929
You can buy me a drink.

196
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,269
I got to keep working
on these reports.

197
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,419
Maybe next time.

198
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,129
Yeah.

199
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,970
But again,

200
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:37,179
excellent work, Dixon.

201
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,470
Yeah. No problem.

202
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:42,279
Like I said, numbers
always tell the story.

203
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,799
So, the numbers telling you

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,940
a story?

205
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeah, and it's a
David Lynch film.

206
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,720
It's totally incomprehensible.

207
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,275
I mean, if these are
supposed to be fractions,

208
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:23,429
then it's sloppy work.

209
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:24,909
Some of them
aren't even reduced.

210
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,440
I noticed that, too.

211
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,610
Maybe the numbers
represent hard quantities.

212
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:30,129
Like, eight out of
ten somethings,

213
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,360
and not just four-fifths
of something?

214
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,690
Maybe.

215
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:35,649
Yeah, maybe.

216
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,450
Beyond that, two
things stick out.

217
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,120
None of these are 100%, meaning

218
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,539
there's no nine out of
nine or ten out of ten,

219
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,830
and the first four
pages have 26 numbers,

220
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,330
the fifth has 27 and the
last two have 26 again.

221
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,000
Could be an accident.

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,679
Just the way the
information's spaced.

223
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,009
No, seems deliberate to me.
None of these pages are full.

224
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,799
What about the
list of A.M. names?

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,679
Means nothing to me.
I agree with you guys.

226
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,090
It's got to be an alias.

227
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,179
Maybe it's someone with a
grudge against the 110th?

228
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:02,970
We've arrested a lot of people.

229
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,230
What about James Barr?

230
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,769
I mean, that guy's got the
skills and a screw loose.

231
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,980
Barr's a shooter.
Can't picture him

232
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,485
throwing someone
out of a helicopter.

233
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,649
Plus, I ran into him
in Indiana last year.

234
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,789
He owes me now.

235
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,759
I don't want to know.

236
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,620
Pine Barrens.

237
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,419
About a million lonely acres.

238
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,039
A lot like the spot
Upstate New York

239
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,889
where they found Franz.

240
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,149
They left his broken
body out there to rot.

241
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,690
For all we know,
Swan's out there, too.

242
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,779
And Sanchez. And Orozco.

243
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,039
There's no blues station?

244
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,860
Bro, we're in Jersey.

245
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,190
It's from my phone.

246
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:56,570
Franz used to blast
this at HQ all the time

247
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,070
when you weren't around.

248
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,950
Leave it.

249
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,210
<i>They rented a car
under a fake name,</i>

250
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:19,679
but it's, uh, it's Karla Dixon.

251
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,220
She's with them now.

252
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:22,765
They're headed
towards Atlantic City,

253
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,436
probably gonna try to
find their missing buddies.

254
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,639
Good. All in the
same place at once.

255
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,519
When you get
there, take them out.

256
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,809
<i>Copy that.</i>

257
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,809
You remember what I
said about needing backup?

258
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,690
I know some local talent.

259
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,440
Well, bring in whoever you need.

260
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,820
We'll cover the tab.

261
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,870
I just want them
dead by tomorrow.

262
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,740
You hear me?

263
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,759
Fucking dead.

264
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:15,769
Just like Franz's office.

265
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,110
And our hotel rooms.

266
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:20,740
You said they hadn't
trashed Swan's place.

267
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,070
Yup.

268
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,416
Add that to the list of things

269
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,669
that must mean something.

270
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,539
You guys ever know
Orozco to go anywhere

271
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,009
without his lighter?

272
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,389
Better days.

273
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,299
Am I the only one of us
that doesn't have this photo?

274
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,220
- Got mine.
- Got mine.

275
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,610
On my bookshelf.

276
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,679
Hard to hang a picture on your
wall when you don't have walls.

277
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,610
We're wasting our time here.

278
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:00,399
Agreed. We have
what the killers want,

279
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,070
and anything worth
finding, they already got.

280
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,659
Where to next?

281
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,620
A bar.

282
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,409
Look at these photos of
Sanchez and this woman.

283
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,120
Who under 50 frames photos?

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,710
We do.

285
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:16,096
Other than the 110th, how many
photos you have at your house?

286
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,129
Not many.

287
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,559
But she's framed,
so she's important.

288
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,059
We're going to the Lucky Lounge.

289
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,860
No. You two stay here.

290
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,149
You both look like cops.

291
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,399
What do you two look like?

292
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,210
<i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

293
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:09,899
Hey.

294
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,659
This woman working today?

295
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,889
Who are you?

296
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,659
Friends of Jorge Sanchez.

297
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:19,120
Hey, Dulls.

298
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,100
These guys say they're
friends of Sanchez,

299
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,480
want to talk to Milena.

300
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,720
Take them back to the
office. She's doing the books.

301
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,759
Milena.

302
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:53,259
Take your shit and
get out of here, now.

303
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,059
I get that he's a
different kind of guy,

304
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,370
but our commanding
officer buys used underwear.

305
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,269
Isn't that the girl
from the photo?

306
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,039
Oh, shit.

307
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,090
Hey!

308
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,879
This is as far as we're going.

309
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,919
What's going on, fellas?

310
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,635
You guys are gonna
stop coming around here

311
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:22,460
and messing with our friends.

312
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:24,940
Look, pal, you somehow got...

313
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,769
Don't touch me!

314
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,669
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

315
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,750
Move your ass.

316
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,120
I'm done, I'm done.

317
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,529
Well, it's a good thing

318
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,889
O'Donnell and I didn't go in.

319
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,929
Something could've gone wrong.

320
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,230
You making friends, big fella?

321
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,630
I'm so sorry. I
never would've run

322
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,880
if I'd known who you were.

323
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,930
I should've recognized
you from Jorge's photos.

324
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,140
My guys were just
looking out for me.

325
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,640
Scary dude came in here
asking for her about a week ago.

326
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,890
Said he was working
with Sanchez and Orozco

327
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,190
on some big security job.

328
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,809
Broad-shouldered bald guy?

329
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,859
No. He had hair.

330
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,230
Scar down his cheek.

331
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,400
He wanted to know
if Sanchez had left

332
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,609
any kind of digital
storage device

333
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:32,900
with me. I-I had no idea

334
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,140
what he was talking about.

335
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,779
I got a bad vibe off the guy,

336
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,700
so soon as he
left, I called Jorge.

337
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,450
He didn't answer.

338
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,789
They've gone dark
before, part of the job,

339
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,000
but this... feels different.

340
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,675
Then you come in,
claiming to know Sanchez,

341
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,539
looking like the kind of
people somebody'd hire

342
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,549
to rough someone up. No offense.

343
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,970
Assumed you were bad news.

344
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,589
Do you know if Sanchez

345
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:56,259
and Orozco had
any recent contact

346
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,759
with Calvin Franz or Tony Swan?

347
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,799
Actually, yeah. He was
here a couple weeks ago.

348
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,779
They hadn't seen
each other in forever.

349
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:03,950
I took a picture of them.

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,650
They were working
a case together.

351
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:09,849
Sanchez told you that?

352
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,730
Yeah.

353
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,359
What was it?

354
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,609
He didn't mention details.

355
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,049
Was Swan involved?

356
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,329
He didn't come down to A.C.,

357
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,490
but I heard them
mention his name.

358
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,700
You tried asking
Franz about this?

359
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,539
- We can't.
- Why not?

360
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,470
Someone threw him
out of a helicopter.

361
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,019
Oh, my God.

362
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,069
You think Jorge and
Manuel are dead, too?

363
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,890
We don't know yet.

364
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,849
If they're alive,
we'll find them,

365
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:43,180
but we need your help.

366
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,849
Is there anything
else you can recall

367
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:47,440
that you haven't told us?

368
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,769
Um...

369
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,539
I don't know.

370
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
Last time I saw Jorge,

371
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,339
he was sitting on
that stool right there.

372
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,079
He got a call.

373
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,410
Seemed important.

374
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:02,789
He say anything?

375
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,675
Kind of. He-he repeated
a couple of numbers,

376
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,869
kind of like he was
surprised by them,

377
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:09,210
or-or worried, maybe.

378
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,846
Then he said he was
going out for a while,

379
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:11,920
and he never came back.

380
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,380
Do you remember the numbers?

381
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:16,170
Yeah. He said,

382
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,589
"650 at 100k each."

383
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:19,976
No idea what he meant by that.

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,145
You're sure that's what he said?

385
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,519
I'm positive. He
said, "650 at 100k,"

386
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,849
he kissed me on the cheek

387
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,750
and he ran out that door.

388
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,569
You remember the last words
someone you love said to you.

389
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,539
We've got the numbers,
we've got the New York plates.

390
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,880
Maybe this isn't about someone
with a grudge against the 110th.

391
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,516
If you haven't
noticed, it's pretty likely

392
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,096
four of us have already
been killed already.

393
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,766
Milena said Franz was
here a couple weeks ago.

394
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,029
If the guys were onto something

395
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,726
that made them think
we were all in danger,

396
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,970
they would've called
then, not weeks later.

397
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,009
650 at 100k, we're
talking 65 million bucks.

398
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,470
That's a lot of black chips.

399
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,599
Most places. Not here.

400
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,150
Atlantic City casinos
rake in, what?

401
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,900
Gross gaming revenue's got to
be a couple billion a year, easy.

402
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,400
65 million, if taken carefully,

403
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,279
over time, could go
unnoticed for a while.

404
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,859
Not that long.

405
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,165
Not with casino accountants
watching the take like hawks.

406
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,950
But could the bad guys
hide it in the margins

407
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,215
long enough to get away with it

408
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,720
before the calculator
crew catches on?

409
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,369
Sanchez and Orozco do
freelance casino security.

410
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,089
I mean, maybe it
all started with them.

411
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,500
They stumbled onto something
big, they needed help...

412
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,609
So they reached out
to Franz... maybe Swan.

413
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,180
Guess this whole thing
could be tied to gaming.

414
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,599
I'm Ellie, I'll be your server.

415
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,009
What can I get you?

416
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,529
The casino's
director of security.

417
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,329
Now, please.

418
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:53,019
So, you're the 110th.

419
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,559
What's left of us.

420
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,359
Sanchez and Orozco talk
about you guys all the time.

421
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,900
Please.

422
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,200
So, you knew them well?

423
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,359
Uh, yeah. They would
do background checks

424
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,119
for all the casinos
on the boardwalk.

425
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,579
Hold on. Uh, you
just said "knew them."

426
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,660
Past tense.

427
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:11,619
We have reason to
believe they might be dead.

428
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,089
Oh, shit.

429
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,250
I-I just saw them,

430
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,920
uh, while I was picking up lunch
at White House Subs last month.

431
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,299
How can I help?

432
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,859
These numbers
mean anything to you?

433
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,390
Not offhand.

434
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,849
What about the phrase,
"650 at 100k each"?

435
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:32,440
No. Uh, what's this all about?

436
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,809
We think Sanchez and Orozco

437
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,109
may have been looking into
a $65 million gambling scam.

438
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,529
Okay. Uh, well, in that case,

439
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,660
your "650" could be
rigged slot machines

440
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,950
or fixed hands of poker,
but at 100k per hand,

441
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,369
that'd be incredibly
high stakes.

442
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:54,420
And I can tell you right
now, our books are on mark.

443
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,130
All right? We're
not missing a penny.

444
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:57,630
What about your competitors?

445
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:00,380
You know, I can...
I can ask around,

446
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:03,720
see if anyone knew what Sanchez
and Orozco were working on.

447
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,049
That might narrow
it down for you.

448
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,650
While you're at it,
run these names,

449
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,789
see if any of them are
registered at a hotel in town.

450
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,150
Uh... you know, this-this
might take a few hours.

451
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,650
Where are you guys staying?

452
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:19,789
Don't know yet.

453
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,819
Well, then, please, allow me.

454
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,109
Not necessary.

455
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,700
No, no. Any friends of
Sanchez and Orozco.

456
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,029
Well, it looks like

457
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,289
all we have
available is a suite.

458
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,200
I guess that'll have to do.

459
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,670
Come on, I'll get
you guys settled in.

460
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,250
We'll be fine at a motel.

461
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,630
Reacher, when someone offers

462
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,589
to comp you a
suite, just say yes.

463
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:44,846
Yeah. We'll have them send
you up a park bench to sleep on.

464
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,440
You'll feel right at home.

465
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,750
What was that about
a motel, Reacher?

466
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:07,740
Whoa. I bet this
place has a spa.

467
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,369
I'm gonna take a schvitz.

468
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,579
Ooh. Dibs on the ocean view.

469
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:44,359
O'Donnell and
Neagley found the bar.

470
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,650
It's fully stocked.
Not for long.

471
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:49,210
You unpacked?

472
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,890
Yup.

473
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,880
I haven't been in a hotel

474
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,160
that wasn't advertised as
"family friendly" in years.

475
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,339
I still can't believe

476
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,380
David O'Donnell procreated.

477
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,970
On purpose, anyway.

478
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,049
Yeah, I seem to remember
someone bragging

479
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,935
that the only people
that would call you Daddy

480
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,160
were the women you slept with.

481
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,769
I still sleep with people
who call me Daddy.

482
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,230
Sometimes all three of
them if it's thundering outside.

483
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:24,269
You'll find out
soon enough, Dixon.

484
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,470
You're pregnant?

485
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,529
What? No. Shit no.

486
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,319
No, she's engaged.

487
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,950
What, you didn't know?

488
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,660
Someone finally
lassoed our little filly.

489
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:37,410
No, I, um, didn't...

490
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,710
Yeah. Well, about that,

491
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,329
you guys can, uh,
unsave the date.

492
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:43,769
Fuck. Seriously?

493
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,976
Yeah, I mean, you know me.
I've always been a numbers gal,

494
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,799
always had a life plan.

495
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,680
Plan said to get married at
a certain age, certain year.

496
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,099
And then one day, I see
text messages on his phone.

497
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,849
It says, "Hey, sweetheart,
can't wait to see you Friday.

498
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,195
I miss you." And all of that.

499
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,940
No. No one steps out on Dixon.

500
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,559
Not even him, apparently.

501
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,359
Text messages
were from his niece

502
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,730
who was visiting.

503
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,029
But I realized

504
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,450
that when I thought
he was cheating,

505
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,049
I was, uh...

506
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,869
I was relieved.

507
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:19,039
I mean, he's a decent man.

508
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,039
I... I don't know, if
you're gonna spend

509
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,546
the rest of your life with
somebody, don't you want to

510
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:24,500
feel something
more than comfort?

511
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,339
I mean, don't you
want to feel excitement,

512
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:28,759
a little jolt of something

513
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,559
when you see him?

514
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:34,140
Anyways, you know, for a moment

515
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,645
I thought I was gonna get out
of it with no mess and no guilt,

516
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,680
but instead, I
got out of it with...

517
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,180
A lot of mess and
a whole lot of guilt.

518
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,940
Bingo.

519
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,730
Good for you.

520
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,150
Karla Dixon doesn't settle.

521
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:48,269
Thank you.

522
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,490
That's actually why I
took the undercover job.

523
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,990
Take a little time
away from it all.

524
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,109
Explain to me how
undercover work

525
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:56,779
and forensic
accounting go together?

526
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,490
Well, um, CEO
embezzling millions

527
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,200
from a company down in Texas,

528
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,119
where everybody's
packing some kind of heat,

529
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,715
and he was the kind of
guy to use it if cornered,

530
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,420
so got a little intrigue along
with the number-crunching.

531
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:11,170
All right. And what
about you, Neagley?

532
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,380
Every time I check my LinkedIn,

533
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,726
you're getting promoted again.

534
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,799
I'm having fun.

535
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,930
On big cases,
running a team now.

536
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,680
Trying to land this huge
software company as a client.

537
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,730
I pull it off, I get a
taste of that fat contract.

538
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,930
Making it rain.

539
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,400
No choice.

540
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,445
I really want to get my dad
on round-the-clock nursing care

541
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,950
and rent him a nice place
closer to me, but that takes capital.

542
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,819
Why rent? Buy and build equity.

543
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:34,740
Get a condo.

544
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,910
Co-ops are fucking
banana republics.

545
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,279
Yeah.

546
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,200
What about you, big dog?

547
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,509
Being awfully quiet over there.

548
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,079
Home ownership is like
keeping snakes as pets

549
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,130
or ballroom dancing
competitions.

550
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:50,880
Fine, if that's
what you're into.

551
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,339
I just don't see the appeal.

552
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,920
Or the appeal of a steady job.

553
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,140
Corporate world doesn't
seem that different

554
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,930
from the Army, and that
always felt a little like a cage.

555
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,859
Just didn't know anything else.

556
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,980
Then one day I was in a bar,
and someone plays Howlin' Wolf

557
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,519
singing about trains
going by in the night.

558
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,109
That sounded like
real freedom to me.

559
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,940
Are you jumping on freight
trains like Boxcar Willie?

560
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,740
Sometimes.

561
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,609
Mostly I take
buses or hitchhike.

562
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,490
What kind of lunatic

563
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,660
is picking up the
world's biggest drifter?

564
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:24,700
They can be interesting.

565
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,079
Where do you eat?

566
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,500
I steal pie off windowsills.

567
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,210
I'm being serious.

568
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,380
Diners. Sometimes
people who pick me up

569
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,049
share a meal with me.

570
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,970
Sometimes I share with them.

571
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,759
Where do you sleep?

572
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,220
Cheap motels mostly.

573
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,660
And what if you can't find one?

574
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,309
Unattended boats in
marinas are good for a night.

575
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:45,980
Flatbeds of parked trucks.

576
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,390
Had a great night's
sleep in a hammock

577
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:50,029
I spotted in some
guy's backyard once

578
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,339
till the sprinklers went off.

579
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,900
Good God, man.

580
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:54,690
All you need is a
stick and a bindle.

581
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,250
Too much luggage.

582
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:00,779
Any more questions?

583
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,779
Yeah,

584
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,470
just one.

585
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,549
Don't you ever get lonely?

586
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:31,309
Looks like someone took the sign

587
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,109
as a personal challenge.

588
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:34,960
Doreen, I'm just warming up.

589
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
<i>If you liked the dinner,</i>

590
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,279
<i>make sure to try
Neptune's breakfast buffet.</i>

591
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,869
<i>Every day, starting at 6:00 a.m.</i>

592
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:44,700
Thank you.

593
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,059
Looks like I'm not the
only one who couldn't sleep.

594
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,480
Numbers relax me.

595
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,920
Figured if I was gonna do math,

596
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,809
I might as well make some
walking-around money.

597
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,490
- Stand.
- Ma'am, you're showing ten

598
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,786
and eight on two of your hands.

599
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,700
That's right. And I
could double down

600
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,180
and risk it all
for a potentially

601
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,029
larger payout.

602
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,369
Or I could stand and
have a guaranteed win

603
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,809
because the next card out of
that shoe is gonna bust you.

604
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:33,539
My grandmother
always said, pigs get fat,

605
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,750
hogs get slaughtered.

606
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,950
She's no hog.

607
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,549
I'm no hog,

608
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
so I'm gonna stand.

609
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,769
As you wish. 15...

610
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:43,680
Too many.

611
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,640
Congratulations, ma'am.

612
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,640
You're having a
very lucky night.

613
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,849
Maybe you'd like to
celebrate with a concert on us?

614
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,140
Thank you.

615
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:53,440
Ladies of the '80s.
Debbie Gibson, Tiffany,

616
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,276
and Taylor Dane
performing their biggest hits.

617
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:56,986
If you hurry, you can
actually catch the second half.

618
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:58,369
But I'm having fun.

619
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,240
Ma'am, we know
you're counting cards.

620
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,400
Which isn't illegal if
you do it in your head.

621
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,119
But seeing that
your chief of security

622
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,625
was kind enough
to comp us a suite,

623
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,119
I'll cut you some slack.

624
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,619
Want to use those muscles

625
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:13,250
and help me carry these
to the cashier window?

626
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,420
And you can give these tickets

627
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:16,925
to the guy in the
Members Only jacket.

628
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,019
He looks like he would
enjoy some '80s ladies.

629
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,240
Thanks for coming with.

630
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,410
Late-night walks
always clear my head,

631
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:52,910
and after the text I got
from Neagley about Franz,

632
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:55,500
my head's been kind
of cloudy, you know?

633
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,920
Yeah.

634
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,579
I'm surprised
you can walk at all

635
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:00,500
with all the casino's
money in your pockets.

636
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,730
Can I assume the
forensic accountant's

637
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,549
gonna declare that
cash on her taxes?

638
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,180
Those crooks?

639
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,839
If there's anybody
I could audit...

640
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,259
Actually, it's kind
of my dream job.

641
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,390
Current gig doesn't give
you your auditing fix?

642
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:14,855
No, I'm just
busting millionaires

643
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,230
from stealing from billionaires.

644
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,559
What I really want to do

645
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,940
is go after government
corruption and waste.

646
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,569
Oh, you used to
work for Uncle Sam.

647
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:22,905
You know what I'm talking about.

648
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,190
$600 toilet seats.

649
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,740
Exactly. I mean, if tax
money was spent efficiently,

650
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,529
honestly, we could fix roads
and bridges and schools.

651
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,690
Like, we could help people
who actually need help.

652
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,660
We could make a difference.

653
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,119
You should do it.

654
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,210
Yeah. Well, I looked into

655
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,670
starting my own
nonprofit watchdog group,

656
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:44,940
but start-up costs
are prohibitive.

657
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,359
First step's always the hardest.

658
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,970
Yeah.

659
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,220
Is that why, back in the day,

660
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,680
you and I never happened?

661
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,079
First steps were the hardest?

662
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:03,630
How much did you drink
back at the hotel room?

663
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,170
Enough to ask you that question.

664
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I mean, come on, Reacher.

665
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,039
It's not like I didn't
drop any hints.

666
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,299
I was your boss. It
wouldn't have been right.

667
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,789
Wow. Well, I waited
years for that answer,

668
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,259
and it's pure Reacher.

669
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,400
Direct, honest
and well-reasoned.

670
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:35,700
So, can I ask you
another question?

671
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,776
What do you want to do about

672
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,410
the two guys that
are following us?

673
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
When'd you spot them?

674
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,769
Ooh, when we left the casino.

675
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,190
Figure they saw us cashing out

676
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,789
and now they're
gonna try to rob us.

677
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,109
That's what I thought, too.

678
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:50,359
But see that car

679
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,246
parked up the street with
the New York dealer tags?

680
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,369
Yeah.

681
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,046
Pretty sure it was behind
us on the expressway

682
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:56,069
when we came into town.

683
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,119
Also, pretty sure
when we walk by it,

684
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,789
a man with a gun will step out.

685
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,079
Then, when we turn to run,

686
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,250
the guys behind us won't
be so far behind anymore.

687
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,880
So what's the plan?

688
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,960
We're not gonna
walk by that car.

689
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,440
On my "go," over the fence.

690
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
Go.

691
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:12,109
Fuck.

692
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,529
Go, go.

693
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,109
Okay, there's got to
be a warrant out for you

694
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:27,589
in New York for
hitting that cop.

695
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,069
We open fire in
a residential area,

696
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:31,109
cops get called,
you get locked up.

697
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,549
Let's do this without guns.

698
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,990
Looks like they
have the same idea.

699
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,660
Need help with yours?

700
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:40,220
I'll manage.

701
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,849
Aah!

702
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:57,150
Aah!

703
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:34,420
Damn, Reacher.
When we were kids,

704
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:35,820
we just wrote our names in it.

705
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,929
It's the Members
Only jacket guy from

706
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,429
the casino.

707
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,719
Oh, shit.

708
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,525
If they went after us,
they might go after

709
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,630
Neagley and O'Donnell, too.

710
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,099
No, they waited

711
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,559
until we were off the
boardwalk to make their move.

712
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,235
They're not gonna
go into a busy hotel

713
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,559
with cameras everywhere.

714
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,320
No I.D.

715
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,170
Let's search this asshole's car.

716
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,059
Looks like someone
did their homework.

717
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:18,860
Phone.

718
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,679
<i>Is it done?</i>

719
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,369
Not in the way you expected.

720
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,320
You're fucking with
the wrong guy, Reacher.

721
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,900
You should know that this
doesn't end well for you.

722
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,380
<i>Then why are you the
one that sounds scared?</i>

723
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,079
Think I got his attention.

724
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,909
Should we trace the number?

725
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,619
This is a burner.

726
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,289
Guy on the other end
will be using a burner, too.

727
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,090
Dealer tags are most
likely ghost plates,

728
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,050
VIN's been scratched off.

729
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,760
Nothing to I.D. any of them.

730
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:02,219
These guys are pros.

731
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,260
We should've left
one of them alive.

732
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,349
Yeah, but they didn't give
us much of a choice, did they?

733
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,739
Maybe not. Now we
have nothing to go on.

734
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,599
Not necessarily.

735
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,909
Parking lot pass.

736
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,440
"New Age Technologies."

737
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,610
- Yeah.
- Stamped yesterday morning.

738
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,380
I think it's what
you call a clue.

739
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,800
Now what are we gonna
do about those bodies?

740
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,550
I have an idea.

741
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,030
I'm thirsty. Want to get a beer?

742
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,650
Anything on New Age?

743
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:08,119
Yeah, looks like New Age

744
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:10,280
is an aerospace company.

745
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,789
Any ties to Atlantic City?

746
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,960
Not that I can see.

747
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:17,349
Headquarters are
based in New York.

748
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:23,630
Looks like a piece
of shrapnel bit me.

749
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,179
I didn't notice with all
the adrenaline pumping.

750
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,590
Barely winged you.

751
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:29,989
Here.

752
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:39,690
What you doing?

753
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:42,320
What my mom used to
do when the alcohol stung.

754
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,989
Mm. You know,
you're probably just

755
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,610
blowing germs into it.

756
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,699
Probably.

757
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,630
But it feels good.

758
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:56,050
Thanks.

759
00:39:58,269 --> 00:39:59,679
Welcome.

760
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,889
You know, Reacher,

761
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,239
it's perfectly normal
to be lonely sometimes.

762
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:18,369
Anyone living their life
the way you do would.

763
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:22,579
But you don't have
to be lonely tonight.

764
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,090
And you're not my boss anymore.

765
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:32,179
All 650 will be in the truck.

766
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,976
You can track the shipment
with the GPS locater

767
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,349
I paired to this.

768
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,179
There are at least two
good ambush points

769
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,190
- marked on the route.
- Excellent.

770
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,230
My men will take
care of the rest.

771
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:45,860
And the weapons?

772
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:48,380
They'll all be used overseas?
I was told that was the deal.

773
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,190
Absolutely.

774
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:53,780
And the, and the truck
driver won't be harmed?

775
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,449
Of course.

776
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,800
I would never harm anyone.

777
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:17,849
Morning, Dixon.

778
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,646
We need to talk to you about
what happened last night.

779
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,929
Oh, the whole hotel heard
what happened last night.

780
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,639
Told you you were loud.

781
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,650
Found this in a car
that followed us down

782
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,489
- from New York yesterday.
- What happened

783
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,400
to the driver?

784
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,820
He won't be following us back.

785
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:33,400
Neither will his two friends.

786
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,489
Shit.

787
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,619
Who is it?

788
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,179
Wright.

789
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,750
Clear.

790
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:46,309
Come on in.

791
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:50,880
You, uh, you folks
seem a little jumpy.

792
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:53,880
I mean, I don't blame you,
given the circumstances.

793
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,219
And I hate to be the
bearer of more bad news,

794
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,349
but when I was
looking into things,

795
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:00,760
Atlantic City PD told
me that two more bodies

796
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,019
have been discovered
in Upstate New York,

797
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,559
near where they
found your other friend.

798
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,150
Judging by the decomposition,
they'd been there a while.

799
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:11,420
Got a copy of the
police report for you.

800
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,219
Pretty easy to
I.D. him with that.

801
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,820
When he joined the
Army, his sister was terrified

802
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:37,010
he'd be killed with
some disfiguring wounds.

803
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,969
She'd never know
what happened to him.

804
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,679
Said his dog tags
could be blown off.

805
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,920
To calm her down, he got
his name and service number

806
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,690
tattooed across his back.

807
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:50,150
Looked ridiculous.

808
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:51,769
He didn't care.

809
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:54,360
He loved his sister.

810
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,150
I'm gonna have to call her.

811
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:59,199
I'll tell Milena about Jorge.

812
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,449
Their wounds match Franzy's.

813
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,590
Meaning he was tortured
and tossed out of a helicopter.

814
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,909
Uh, one other thing.

815
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,289
Um, no one using any of
the names you gave me

816
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,210
have checked into any
of the hotels in town.

817
00:44:14,409 --> 00:44:17,170
And I talked to my
counterparts at the other casinos.

818
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:18,929
Orozco and Sanchez,

819
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,219
they weren't working on
anything for any of them.

820
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,429
And when I told them about
the $65 million gambling scam,

821
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,985
they pulled their
overnight audits.

822
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,269
I did, too.

823
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:32,519
Everything is within
acceptable loss margins.

824
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,980
No one has hit
any of the casinos.

825
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:35,980
You don't have
anything to worry about.

826
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:37,380
Bodies were found in New York,

827
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,360
car that followed us
was from New York.

828
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:42,070
New York ghost tags,
New York parking pass.

829
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:44,050
This has always
been a New York case.

830
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:53,059
Where the hell are you going?

831
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,550
We're gonna need more guns.
