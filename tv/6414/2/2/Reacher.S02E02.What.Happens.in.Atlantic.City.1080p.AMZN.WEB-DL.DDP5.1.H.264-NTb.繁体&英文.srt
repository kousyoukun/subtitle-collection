1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,250
《烈探雷徹》前情提要
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,090
我收到你的消息了
I got your message.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,340
110特別調查組 “10-30” 這是求救信號
110th, 10-30. A distress call.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,720
卡爾文弗朗茨被謀殺了
Calvin Franz was murdered.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,680
如果他給你打過電話 那他可能也給隊里其他人打過
If he was calling you for help, he may have been trying to get in touch with the rest of the unit.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,140
我給奧唐納 迪克森 桑切斯 和奧羅斯科打了電話 都沒人接
I called O'Donnell, Dixon, Sanchez and Orozco. No one's answering.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,230
我買通了門房
I paid off the concierge.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,740
他指認內格利登記入住
He I.D.'d Neagley as checking in.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,780
盯緊那家酒店還有他們
Just keep an eye on that hotel and them.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,660
- 沒人會知道你是誰 - 但你知道
No one will really know who you are. But you know.

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,590
- 嘿 奧唐納 - 嘿 內格利
Hey, O'Donnell. Hey, Neagley.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,960
只是一個名單 所有名字的首字母都是AM
Just a list of names, all starting with the initials "A.M."

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,260
我剛得到的是一頁又一頁的隨機數據
I just got page after page of random numbers.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,550
- 沒有順序 沒有意義 什么都沒 - 至少我們覺得沒有 而且暫時而已
No order, no meaning. Nothing. At least to us, for now.

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,600
你有什么想法
What are you thinking?

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,350
我覺得有人一心想干掉特別調查員
I'm thinking there's someone hell-bent on taking out the special investigators.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,020
他們是沖我們來的
And they're coming after us.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,980
很好
Good.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,940
如果他們的目標是110小組 那他們怎么還沒殺我們
So, if someone's coming after the 110, how come they haven't made a run at the three of us yet?

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,320
你之前跟家人在樹林里 沒人能找到我
You were in the woods with your family, no one can ever find me

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,570
或許還沒輪到內格利
and maybe they just hadn't gotten around to Neagley yet.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,160
他們去了我們的酒店房間
They were in our hotel rooms,

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,160
也許他們是想抓或者殺了我們 隨后因故不得不匆忙離開
maybe to grab us or take us out, but then had to bail for some reason.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,420
我們得再試著警告其他人
We need to try again to warn the others.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,040
- 我會給桑切斯和奧羅斯科打電話 - 我來聯系迪克森
I'll call Sanchez and Orozco. I got Dixon.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
街對面幾棟房子外有一輛黑色轎車
There's a black sedan across the street, couple houses down.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,460
跟昨天遇到的是同一輛
Same one as yesterday.

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,090
我猜你說得對 我們被跟蹤了
Guess you were right. We're being followed.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,430
你打算怎么處理
How you want to play this?

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,310
我要去做個自我介紹
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,770
看看這個該死的美男子
Look at this fucking beaut.

32
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,950
他打算干什么呢
What's he think he's gonna do?

33
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,080
我他媽的鼻子 兄弟
Fucking nose, man.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,670
有槍
Gun!

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,590
就像過去美好的時光
Just like the good old days.

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,520
是啊 你在一旁觀望 而我把所有工作都做完了
Yeah, you on the sidelines while I do all the work.

37
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,230
伙計們 這是他的槍
Uh, fellas, this was his gun.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,310
紐約市警察局
NYPD?

39
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,570
名叫蓋塔諾拉索
Name's Gaitano Russo.

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,650
嘿 別看我 你把所有工作都做完了
Don't look at me. You did all the work.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,750
我得說 兄弟 你闖大禍了
Got to say, man. Major screwup.

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,170
拉索一醒來 整個紐約市警察局都會追捕你
Soon as Russo wakes up, the entire NYPD's gonna be after your ass.

43
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,970
你為什么下手那么狠
Why'd you got to hit him so hard, huh?

44
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,300
我出手從不手軟
I don't hit soft.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,680
- 襲警可是要坐很久的牢 - 那只狗的事情讓我很生氣
Well, a cop puncher's gonna do some serious time. I was pissed about the dog,

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,480
我以為他參與了殺害弗朗茨和斯旺
and I assumed he was involved in killing Franzy and Swan.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,150
你怎么教我們的  “在調查中 假設害死人”
What did you teach us? "In an investigation, assumptions kill."

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,570
是“在調查時 細節至關重要”
No, it was "In an investigation, details matter".

49
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,280
我沒殺他 只是打斷了他的鼻子 他醒來時會沒事的
I didn't kill him, just broke his nose. He'll be fine when he wakes up.

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,450
糟了 蓋塔諾拉索
Shit. Gaitano Russo.

51
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,160
又叫蓋伊拉索 他是弗朗茨謀殺案的調查人員
Guy Russo. He's the investigating officer in Franz's homicide.

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,750
- 我在檔案中看到過他的名字 - 他是怎么開始跟蹤你的
I saw it in the files. And how'd he get on your tail?

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,670
紐約市警察局看到弗朗茨 給你打了電話 標記了你的名字
NYPD saw the calls Franz made to you, flagged your name,

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,590
你買票的時候 他們收到了提醒
got an alert when you bought the plane tickets,

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,300
自從你落地以后一直跟著你 問題是 為什么
been on you since you landed. Question is "why?"

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,550
問題是 哪里
Question is "where?"

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,180
哪里可以藏一個近兩米的重罪犯 這樣你就不會被關進監獄了
As in, where do we hide a six-foot-five felon so you don't wind up in the pokey.

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,640
我不走 這里是案發現場
I'm not leaving. The case is here.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,180
也許不是
Maybe not.

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,970
我給桑切斯和奧羅斯科的辦公室 打電話時 語音信箱已經滿了
When I called Sanchez and Orozco's office, voice mail was full.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,140
這是個噩兆
That's a bad sign.

62
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,230
考慮到這位“拳王” 擊倒了一位執法人員
So it might not be a bad time to get out of Dodge,

63
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,650
現在出去避風頭或許不失為好主意
considering Cocky Balboa here just knocked out a lawman.

64
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,190
好吧 我們去大西洋城
Fine. We'll head down to Atlantic City,

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,990
看我們能不能找到那些人
see if we can find the guys.

66
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,240
首先 我們要退房 并在拉索恢復知覺
First we got to check out of our hotel and find a more generic ride

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,790
讓警方“小心提防”你之前 找到更普通的交通工具
before Russo regains consciousness and puts out a BOLO.

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,620
路虎攬勝太顯眼了
Range Rover's too conspicuous.

69
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,960
就是因為你 我們才不能用好東西
You're the reason we can't have nice things.

70
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,380
烈探雷徹
第二季第二集

71
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,380
本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,310
等等 我不明白 是出車禍了嗎
Wait, I don't understand. Was it a car accident?

73
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,230
沒有 他就踹了一下車
No, he just kicked the car.

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,360
好吧 那為什么 安全氣囊都彈出來了
Well, then how the hell did the airbag go off?

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,690
他踹了一下車
He kicked the car,

76
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,570
然后把警察拉了出來 狠狠地揍了一頓
then he pulled the cop out and he knocked his dick in the dirt.

77
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,320
這家伙就是頭野獸
I'm telling you, this guy's a beast.

78
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,780
到時候 我需要支援
When the time comes, I'm gonna need some backup.

79
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,450
會給你安排支援的
And you'll get it.

80
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,710
但現在 你繼續跟蹤監視他們 別搞砸了
But for now, you just stay on their asses, and don't fuck this up.

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,420
明白
Understood.

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,130
機場臨時停車僅在一號停車場
Short-term airport parking only in Lot 1.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,890
機場臨時停車僅在一號停車場
Short-term airport parking only in Lot 1.

84
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,060
特里蒙特有輛2019款雅閣 正在出售 價格低于市場價
There's a 2019 Accord for sale up in Tremont for way under market value.

85
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,350
僅限現金交易
Cash-only deal.

86
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,280
布朗克斯區最常被盜的車型之一 他不想要任何文件嗎
One of the most stolen makes and models for sale in the Bronx, and the guy wants no paperwork?

87
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
我們坐進去 就跟火燒屁股一樣
We sit in that thing, we burn our asses.

88
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,160
我們別無選擇 我們被警方標記了 什么都租不了
We don't have a choice. We're flagged in the system. We can't rent anything under our names.

89
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,160
我們開著偷來的車到處走 那很有可能被逮捕
Well, we drive around in a stolen vehicle, we risk getting pinched.

90
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,660
我有解決辦法了
I've got our solution.

91
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,880
你的臥底工作怎么樣了
How was your undercover job?

92
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,550
雷徹
Reacher.

93
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
你怎么知道我在臥底
How'd you know I was undercover?

94
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,770
考慮到當時的情況 你會馬上過來
Considering the circumstances, you would've come right away.

95
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,020
但你沒有 這意味著 你最近才收到我們的消息
But you didn't, which can only mean you didn't get our messages until recently.

96
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,070
如果你在休假 你會向你的辦公室匯報
But if you were on vacation, you would've checked in with your office periodically.

97
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,200
所以你一定是去做臥底了 還藏得很深
So you had to be working undercover, deep undercover,

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,490
沒辦法頻繁簽到
where frequent check-ins aren't always possible.

99
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,910
你還是一如既往地厲害啊
Same old Reacher.

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,620
我在調查一起企業貪污案
Corporate embezzlement case.

101
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,830
在德克薩斯州待了很久
Stuck in Texas so long, I started to think

102
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,040
久到我都開始覺得自己 喜歡牛仔靴和高中橄欖球了
I actually liked cowboy boots and high school football.

103
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,670
你還帶著假身份證嗎
Still got your fake ID with you?

104
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,250
- 帶著呢 - 很好
- Yeah. - Good.

105
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,880
- 拿它去租車吧 - 為什么要保密
Use it to rent the car. What's with all the secrecy?

106
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,840
內格利 奧唐納和我被警方標記了
Neagley, O'Donnell and I have been flagged in the system.

107
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,170
我還打暈了一名警察
And I punched out a cop.

108
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,140
好吧 并不意外
Of course you did.

109
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,640
那么
So...

110
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,310
弗朗茨...
Franz.

111
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,390
是的
Yeah.

112
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,810
斯旺也兇多吉少
And Swan, most likely.

113
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,820
桑切斯和奧羅斯科也失蹤了
Sanchez and Orozco are MIA, too.

114
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,320
好吧
Okay.

115
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,580
好吧 那我們來調查吧
Okay, so we take care of business.

116
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,330
不要惹特別調查員
You do not mess with the special investigators.

117
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,920
接下來
Next.

118
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,300
- 一定要租一輛... - SUV 我知道 你需要車內空間高點
Make sure you get an... SUV. I know. You need the headroom.

119
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,820
太好了 很高興看到你還在這里
Good. Glad to see you're still here.

120
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,610
感覺我永遠都不會離開
Feel like I'm never gonna leave.

121
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,110
如果世界上任何一個 軍事基地報告了任何違規行為
If it's reported at any Army base anywhere in the world,

122
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,660
無論多么輕微 我們都得處理
no matter how minor the infraction, we're copied on it.

123
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,830
你發現什么特別的事了嗎
Well, anything jump out at you?

124
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,910
是的 20分鐘前 有一只蜜露大小的老鼠
Yeah, a rat the size of a honeydew about 20 minutes ago.

125
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,910
說真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

126
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,670
它又回到那堆箱子那邊了
It's back in those boxes somewhere.

127
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,040
好惡心
Gross.

128
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,420
說到老鼠 我覺得 我發現了一只可疑的“老鼠”
Well, speaking of rats, I think I smell one.

129
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,970
阿富汗的一名指揮官 認為有人在偷航空燃料
A commanding officer at a base in Afghanistan thinks someone's stealing aviation fuel.

130
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,090
把汽油抽走 然后再賣出去
Siphoning off gas to resell it on the side?

131
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,390
這不是軍方想讓我們優先處理的案子
Not exactly the kind of priority case the Army wants us taking on.

132
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,810
我覺得并不是有人在偷取并倒賣燃料
Right, but see, I don't think anybody's stealing and reselling anything.

133
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,440
看看這些數字 它們總能說明問題
Take a look at these numbers. They always tell a story.

134
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,190
我注意到每次基地里有燃料丟失時
See, I noticed that every time fuel went missing from the base,

135
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,650
都是在一趟特定的航班之后
it was always after a specific flight.

136
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,820
即每當C-17 將悍馬車運回美國的時候
Whenever C-17s ferried Humvees back home to the States.

137
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,240
我的意思是 這是個小細節 但在調查時 細節至關重要
I mean, it's a minor detail, but in an investigation, details matter.

138
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,540
我喜歡這句
I like that.

139
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,500
我會說這句的
I'm gonna use it.

140
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,080
我的就是你的
What's mine is yours.

141
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,170
那么
So...

142
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,380
你推測出來了嗎
you have a theory?

143
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,300
是的 沒有跡象表明基地附近
Yeah. There's been no indication of black market fuel sales

144
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
存在黑市燃料銷售的情況
anywhere on or around the base,

145
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,470
那這些燃料是怎么消失的呢
so how does all that fuel go missing?

146
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,600
讓燃料消失的最佳方式 就是把它燒了
Best way to make gas disappear is to burn it up.

147
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,020
沒錯 內格利有儲藏運輸石油的經驗
Exactly. Now, Neagley's got the bulk fuel experience

148
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,350
她認為所有運送悍馬的航班 都是故意過度加油的
and she thinks all the Humvee flights are intentionally being over-fueled.

149
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,230
但當這些飛機降落時
But, when those planes land,

150
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,360
油箱中的燃油量與預期相符
the amount of fuel in the tanks is exactly what's expected,

151
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,280
這些都被記錄到賬簿中了
and that gets logged into the books.

152
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,820
怎么會這樣
So, how does that happen?

153
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,700
多余的燃料是在飛機運輸不為人知的
The excess fuel is being used to transport more weight

154
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,450
- 額外貨物的過程中消耗掉的 - 對
than people realize is on the plane. Yeah.

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,160
運輸了一些沉重而秘密的東西
Something heavy and secret is being moved.

156
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,420
沒錯 悍馬車里有違禁品
Exactly. Contraband in the Humvees.

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,670
毒品 槍支 被盜現金 上述所有
Drugs, guns, stolen cash, all of the above.

158
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,090
干得好 迪克森
Good work, Dixon.

159
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,470
你找到了一起值得我們關注的案子
You just found a case worthy of our attention.

160
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,970
我不知道你的感覺 但這些調查讓我口干舌燥
I don't know about you, but all this sleuthing's made me thirsty.

161
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,890
想去慶祝一下嗎
Want to go celebrate?

162
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,850
你可以請我喝一杯
You can buy me a drink.

163
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,230
我得繼續處理這些報告
I got to keep working on these reports.

164
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,940
- 下次吧 - 好的
Maybe next time. Yeah.

165
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,990
但再說一次
But again,

166
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,660
- 干得好 迪克森 - 是啊
excellent work, Dixon. Yeah.

167
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,790
沒問題 如我所說 數字總能說明問題
No problem. Like I said, numbers always tell the story.

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,610
這些數字跟你說明問題了嗎
So, the numbers telling you a story?

169
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,570
是的 但這就像晦澀難懂的電影 完全無法理解
Yeah, and it's a David Lynch film. It's totally incomprehensible.

170
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,620
如果這些是分數 那寫下這些數字的人就太粗心了
I mean, if these are supposed to be fractions, then it's sloppy work.

171
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,540
有些沒被約分
Some of them aren't even reduced.

172
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,580
我也注意到了這一點
I noticed that, too.

173
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,620
也許這些數據代表數量
Maybe the numbers represent hard quantities.

174
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,130
比如 十分之八的某物 而不是五分之四的某物
Like, eight out of ten somethings, and not just four-fifths of something?

175
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,300
有可能
Maybe.

176
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,220
嗯 有可能 除此以外 還有兩件事很突出
Yeah, maybe. Beyond that, two things stick out.

177
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,890
這里面沒有百分之百 也就是說沒有九分之九
None of these are 100%, meaning there's no nine out of nine

178
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,010
或十分之十 前四頁有26個數字
or ten out of ten, and the first four pages have 26 numbers,

179
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,350
第五頁有27個 最后兩頁又是26個
the fifth has 27 and the last two have 26 again.

180
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,560
可能是巧合 只是信息的羅列方式
Could be an accident. Just the way the information's spaced.

181
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,020
看起來是刻意而為之的 每一頁都不滿
No, seems deliberate to me. None of these pages are full.

182
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,860
那一連串AM開頭的名字呢
What about the list of A.M. names?

183
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,150
沒有任何意義 我同意你們的看法 應該是化名
Means nothing to me. I agree with you guys. It's got to be an alias.

184
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,570
也許是對110小組懷恨在心的人
Maybe it's someone with a grudge against the 110th?

185
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,030
我們逮捕了很多人
We've arrested a lot of people.

186
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,410
詹姆斯巴爾呢
What about James Barr?

187
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,700
他技術高明 有神經質
I mean, that guy's got the skills and a screw loose.

188
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,330
巴爾是名射手 無法想象 他把人從直升機上扔下去的畫面
Barr's a shooter. Can't picture him throwing someone out of a helicopter.

189
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,710
我去年在印第安納州遇見了他
Plus, I ran into him in Indiana last year.

190
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,750
他現在欠我人情
He owes me now.

191
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,720
我不想知道
I don't want to know.

192
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,680
“松林荒原”
Pine Barrens.

193
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,480
大約有一百萬英畝
About a million lonely acres.

194
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,480
很像他們在紐約北部 發現弗朗茨尸體的地方
A lot like the spot Upstate New York where they found Franz.

195
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,150
他們把他破碎的尸體扔在那里 任其腐爛
They left his broken body out there to rot.

196
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,570
據我們所知 斯旺也在那里
For all we know, Swan's out there, too.

197
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,620
還有桑切斯和奧羅斯科
And Sanchez. And Orozco.

198
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,000
沒有布魯斯電臺嗎
There's no blues station?

199
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,870
兄弟 我們現在在澤西
Bro, we're in Jersey.

200
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,080
是我手機上的
It's from my phone.

201
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,960
以前你不在的時候 弗朗茨總是在總部大聲放這首歌
Franz used to blast this at HQ all the time when you weren't around.

202
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,010
放著吧
Leave it.

203
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,150
他們用假名字租了一輛車 但是是卡拉迪克森去租的
They rented a car under a fake name, but it's, uh, it's Karla Dixon.

204
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
她現在跟他們匯合了
She's with them now.

205
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
他們前往大西洋城 可能是去找他們的伙伴
They're headed towards Atlantic City, probably gonna try to find their missing buddies.

206
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,660
很好 一個地方 一網打盡
Good. All in the same place at once.

207
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,790
你到大西洋城以后 殺了他們
When you get there, take them out.

208
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,870
收到
Copy that.

209
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,750
你還記得我說過我需要支援嗎  我認識一些當地的人才
You remember what I said about needing backup? I know some local talent.

210
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,460
你需要誰 盡管帶上
Well, bring in whoever you need.

211
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,960
我們會付錢
We'll cover the tab.

212
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,050
我只希望你明天干掉他們
I just want them dead by tomorrow.

213
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,970
聽見了嗎 讓他們死翹翹
You hear me? Fucking dead.

214
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,780
新澤西州大西洋城

215
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,580
就像弗朗茨的辦公室一樣
Just like Franz's office.

216
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,880
還像我們的酒店房間
And our hotel rooms.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
你說過他們洗劫了斯旺的住處
You said they hadn't trashed Swan's place.

218
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,880
- 是的 - 把那加入事物列表
Yup. Add that to the list of things

219
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,510
一定意味著什么
that must mean something.

220
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,970
你們知道奧羅斯科 會不帶打火機出門嗎
You guys ever know Orozco to go anywhere without his lighter?

221
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,350
美好時光
Better days.

222
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,360
只有我一個人沒有這張照片嗎
Am I the only one of us that doesn't have this photo?

223
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,280
- 我有 - 我有
- Got mine. - Got mine.

224
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,570
我的放在書架上
On my bookshelf.

225
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,370
家里沒有墻的話 很難把它掛墻上
Hard to hang a picture on your wall when you don't have walls.

226
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,380
我們在這里是浪費時間
We're wasting our time here.

227
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,300
我同意 我們有兇手想要的東西 所有值得找的東西
Agreed. We have what the killers want, and anything worth finding,

228
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,880
他們已經得手了
they already got.

229
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,130
接下來去哪兒
Where to next?

230
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,630
去一家酒吧
A bar.

231
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,430
看看桑切斯和這個女人的這些照片
Look at these photos of Sanchez and this woman.

232
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,520
- 五十歲以下的人誰還會裱照片啊  - 我們會
Who under 50 frames photos? We do.

233
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,350
除了110小組那張 你還有多少照片
Other than the 110th, how many photos you have at your house?

234
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,560
- 不多 - 但她的加了相框 所以她很重要
Not many. But she's framed, so she's important.

235
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
我們要去幸運酒吧
We're going to the Lucky Lounge.

236
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,570
幸運酒吧

237
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,290
不 你們倆待在這里
No. You two stay here.

238
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,500
你們倆看起來像警察
You both look like cops.

239
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,000
你們倆又像什么
What do you two look like?

240
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,170
《小姐與流浪漢》
Lady and the Tramp.

241
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,620
嘿 這個女人今天上班嗎
Hey. This woman working today?

242
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,950
你是誰
Who are you?

243
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,330
豪爾赫桑切斯的朋友
Friends of Jorge Sanchez.

244
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
嘿 杜爾斯
Hey, Dulls.

245
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,290
這倆說他們是桑切斯的朋友 想跟米萊娜談談
These guys say they're friends of Sanchez, want to talk to Milena.

246
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,460
帶他們去后面 她在記賬
Take them back to the office. She's doing the books.

247
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,820
米萊娜
Milena.

248
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,320
拿著你的東西 立刻離開這里
Take your shit and get out of here, now.

249
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,950
我知道他不一樣
I get that he's a different kind of guy,

250
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,040
但我們的指揮官居然買二手內衣
but our commanding officer buys used underwear.

251
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,090
- 那不是照片里的女孩嗎  - 媽的
Isn't that the girl from the photo? Oh, shit.

252
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,550
嘿
Hey!

253
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,430
我們就只能走到這里了
This is as far as we're going.

254
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,850
怎么回事 伙計們
What's going on, fellas?

255
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,520
別再來搞我們的朋友了
You guys are gonna stop coming around here and messing with our friends.

256
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,900
聽我說 朋友 你有點...
Look, pal, you somehow got...

257
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,030
別碰我
Don't touch me!

258
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,630
等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

259
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,630
走啊
Move your ass.

260
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,220
別再打了 我受夠了
I'm done, I'm done.

261
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,300
還好奧唐納和我沒進去
Well, it's a good thing O'Donnell and I didn't go in.

262
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,350
否則可能會出岔子
Something could've gone wrong.

263
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,020
你在交朋友嗎 大塊頭
You making friends, big fella?

264
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,980
抱歉 如果我知道你們是誰 就不會逃跑了
I'm so sorry. I never would've run if I'd known who you were.

265
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,110
我應該認出你們的 我在豪爾赫的照片里看到過你們
I should've recognized you from Jorge's photos.

266
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,030
我的朋友們只是想保護我
My guys were just looking out for me.

267
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,950
大約一周前 一個可怕的家伙 來這里問過她
Scary dude came in here asking for her about a week ago.

268
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,250
那家伙說他和桑切斯以及奧羅斯科 一起在做某個大型安全工作
Said he was working with Sanchez and Orozco on some big security job.

269
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,830
是個寬肩禿頂的家伙
Broad-shouldered bald guy?

270
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,920
不是 他有頭發
No. He had hair.

271
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,790
臉頰上有傷疤
Scar down his cheek.

272
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,010
他想知道桑切斯有沒有 留給我任何數字存儲設備
He wanted to know if Sanchez had left any kind of digital storage device with me.

273
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,090
我不知道他在說什么
I-I had no idea what he was talking about.

274
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,970
那家伙給我一種不祥的感覺 他一走 我就給豪爾赫打了電話
I got a bad vibe off the guy, so soon as he left, I called Jorge.

275
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,010
他沒接
He didn't answer.

276
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,020
他們之前也因為工作失聯過 但這次
They've gone dark before, part of the job, but this...

277
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,020
感覺不一樣
feels different.

278
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,730
你說你認識桑切斯
Then you come in, claiming to know Sanchez,

279
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,650
而你看起來像是被雇來的打手
looking like the kind of people somebody'd hire to rough someone up.

280
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,030
無意冒犯 我以為你不可信
No offense. Assumed you were bad news.

281
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,150
你知道桑切斯和奧羅斯科有沒有跟
Do you know if Sanchez and Orozco had any recent contact

282
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,820
卡爾文弗朗茨或托尼斯旺聯系嗎
with Calvin Franz or Tony Swan?

283
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,200
他幾周前來過 他們已經很久沒見面了
Actually, yeah. He was here a couple weeks ago. They hadn't seen each other in forever.

284
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,910
我給他們拍了張照
I took a picture of them.

285
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,710
他們當時在調查一起案子
They were working a case together.

286
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,630
- 桑切斯跟你說的  - 是的
Sanchez told you that? Yeah.

287
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,130
什么案子
What was it?

288
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,670
他沒提細節
He didn't mention details.

289
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,010
斯旺也參與了嗎
Was Swan involved?

290
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,340
他沒來大西洋城
He didn't come down to A.C.,

291
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,010
但我聽到他們提到了他的名字
but I heard them mention his name.

292
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,760
你們問過弗朗茨這件事嗎
You tried asking Franz about this?

293
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,600
- 我們問不了 - 為什么
- We can't. - Why not?

294
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,430
有人把他從直升機上扔了下去
Someone threw him out of a helicopter.

295
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,820
天啊
Oh, my God.

296
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,030
你們覺得豪爾赫 和曼努埃爾也死了嗎
You think Jorge and Manuel are dead, too?

297
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,990
我們還不知道
We don't know yet.

298
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,660
如果他們還活著 我們會找到他們 但我們需要你幫忙
If they're alive, we'll find them, but we need your help.

299
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,410
你還記得什么沒告訴我們的事情嗎
Is there anything else you can recall that you haven't told us?

300
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,420
我不知道
I don't know.

301
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,550
我上次看見豪爾赫時 他坐在那邊那張凳子上
Last time I saw Jorge, he was sitting on that stool right there.

302
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,470
他接了一個電話 似乎很重要
He got a call. Seemed important.

303
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,800
他說什么了
He say anything?

304
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,720
他重復了幾個數字 好像因此很驚訝
Kind of. He-he repeated a couple of numbers, kind of like he was surprised by them,

305
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
或者擔心
or-or worried, maybe.

306
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,980
他說他要出去 然后就再也沒回來
Then he said he was going out for a while, and he never came back.

307
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,440
- 你記得那些數字嗎  - 記得
Do you remember the numbers? Yeah.

308
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
他說
He said,

309
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,820
“六千五 每手十萬” 不知道是什么意思
"650 at 100k each." No idea what he meant by that.

310
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,120
- 你確定  - 非常確定
You're sure that's what he said? I'm positive.

311
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
他說:“六千五 每手十萬”
He said, "650 at 100k,"

312
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,710
他吻了我的臉頰 跑出了那扇門
he kissed me on the cheek and he ran out that door.

313
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,590
你會記得你愛的人 對你說的最后一句話
You remember the last words someone you love said to you.

314
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,600
我們已經掌握了數字 有紐約車牌
We've got the numbers, we've got the New York plates.

315
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,980
也許這事與痛恨110小組的人無關
Maybe this isn't about someone with a grudge against the 110th.

316
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,860
我們中的四人很可能已經被殺害了
If you haven't noticed, it's pretty likely four of us have already been killed already.

317
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,940
米萊娜說弗朗茨幾周前來過這里
Milena said Franz was here a couple weeks ago.

318
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,360
如果某些事讓他們覺得 我們處于危險之中
If the guys were onto something that made them think we were all in danger,

319
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,860
那他們當時就會給我們打電話 而不是幾周后才打
they would've called then, not weeks later.

320
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,030
六千五 每手十萬 我們說的是六千五百萬美元
650 at 100k, we're talking 65 million bucks.

321
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,530
黑籌碼太多了
That's a lot of black chips.

322
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,740
大多數地方 不是這里
Most places. Not here.

323
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,500
大西洋城的賭場大量斂財 怎么
Atlantic City casinos rake in, what?

324
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,920
賭場的年總收入應該是幾十億
Gross gaming revenue's got to be a couple billion a year, easy.

325
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,670
六千五百萬 如果隨著時間的推移
65 million, if taken carefully, over time,

326
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,300
可能會被忽視一段時間
could go unnoticed for a while.

327
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,010
不會那么久 賭場會計會像老鷹一樣盯著
Not that long. Not with casino accountants watching the take like hawks.

328
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,760
有沒有可能是壞人將其藏得夠久
But could the bad guys hide it in the margins long enough to get away with it

329
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,720
在會計發現之前逃脫懲罰
before the calculator crew catches on?

330
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,310
桑切斯和奧羅斯科 是自由職業賭場保安
Sanchez and Orozco do freelance casino security.

331
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,940
也許事情是從他們開始的
I mean, maybe it all started with them.

332
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,560
他們偶然發現了一件大事 需要幫忙
They stumbled onto something big, they needed help...

333
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,570
所以他們聯系了弗朗茨 或許還有斯旺
So they reached out to Franz... maybe Swan.

334
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,780
這件事可能與賭博有關
Guess this whole thing could be tied to gaming.

335
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,820
我是艾莉 為你們服務 你們需要什么
I'm Ellie, I'll be your server. What can I get you?

336
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,490
我們找安全總監
The casino's director of security.

337
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
請立刻帶我們去吧
Now, please.

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,870
你們是110小組的
So, you're the 110th.

339
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,120
是我們組剩下的成員
What's left of us.

340
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,380
桑切斯和奧羅斯科總是提起你們
Sanchez and Orozco talk about you guys all the time.

341
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
請坐
Please.

342
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,960
你之前很了解他們嗎
So, you knew them well?

343
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,010
是的 他們會對木板人行道 所有賭場進行背景調查
Uh, yeah. They would do background checks for all the casinos on the boardwalk.

344
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,640
等等 你剛說:“之前了解”
Hold on. Uh, you just said "knew them."

345
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
過去時
Past tense.

346
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,470
我們認為他們可能已經死了
We have reason to believe they might be dead.

347
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,430
見鬼
Oh, shit.

348
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,940
我上個月在白宮三明治店 吃午餐的時候還見過他們
I-I just saw them, uh, while I was picking up lunch at White House Subs last month.

349
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,450
- 我能幫什么忙嗎  - 這些數據有什么意義嗎
How can I help? These numbers mean anything to you?

350
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,240
就這么看沒什么意義
Not offhand.

351
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,950
那“六千五 每手十萬”呢
What about the phrase, "650 at 100k each"?

352
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,080
不知道 這究竟是怎么回事
No. Uh, what's this all about?

353
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,290
桑切斯和奧羅斯科可能一直在調查
We think Sanchez and Orozco

354
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,170
一起價值六千五百萬的賭博騙局
may have been looking into a $65 million gambling scam.

355
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
好吧
Okay.

356
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,010
你們說的“六千五”可能是 被操縱的老虎機或固定手牌
Uh, well, in that case, your "650" could be rigged slot machines or fixed hands of poker,

357
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,510
但每手十萬 那可是相當高的賭注
but at 100k per hand, that'd be incredibly high stakes.

358
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,310
我現在就可以告訴你們 我們的賬都是對的
And I can tell you right now, our books are on mark.

359
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,060
一分錢都不少
All right? We're not missing a penny.

360
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,650
那你的競爭對手呢
What about your competitors?

361
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,190
我可以打聽一下
You know, I can... I can ask around,

362
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,690
看是否有人知道桑切斯 和奧羅斯科在調查什么案子
see if anyone knew what Sanchez and Orozco were working on.

363
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,030
- 那樣可能會縮小范圍 - 你打聽時 也順道查查這些名字
That might narrow it down for you. While you're at it, run these names,

364
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,530
看是否有人用其中的名字 登記入住酒店
see if any of them are registered at a hotel in town.

365
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,580
這可能要花幾個小時 你們住哪兒
Uh... you know, this-this might take a few hours. Where are you guys staying?

366
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,750
我們還不知道
Don't know yet.

367
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,840
那請讓我來安排吧
Well, then, please, allow me.

368
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,130
不需要
Not necessary.

369
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,760
那不行 你們可是 桑切斯和奧羅斯科的朋友
No, no. Any friends of Sanchez and Orozco.

370
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,220
看來我們現在只有一間套房了
Well, it looks like all we have available is a suite.

371
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,890
我猜那也夠了吧
I guess that'll have to do.

372
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,730
跟我來 我會安排你們安頓下來
Come on, I'll get you guys settled in.

373
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,140
- 我們去住汽車旅館就行了 - 雷徹
We'll be fine at a motel. Reacher,

374
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,440
當有人請你免費住套房時 直接答應就好
when someone offers to comp you a suite, just say yes.

375
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,980
我們會讓他們送你 一張公園長椅 讓你睡覺
Yeah. We'll have them send you up a park bench to sleep on.

376
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,280
你會有賓至如歸的感覺
You'll feel right at home.

377
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,840
雷徹 你不會還想住汽車旅館吧
What was that about a motel, Reacher?

378
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,050
這地方肯定有水療中心
Whoa. I bet this place has a spa.

379
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,840
我要蒸桑拿
I'm gonna take a schvitz.

380
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,720
這還是個海景房
Ooh. Dibs on the ocean view.

381
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,880
奧唐納和內格利找到了吧臺
O'Donnell and Neagley found the bar.

382
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,090
里面“庫存”充足
It's fully stocked.

383
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,550
不過一會就不夠了 放好行李了嗎
Not for long. You unpacked?

384
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,220
好了
Yup.

385
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,520
我很多年沒住過 沒標榜“家庭友好”的酒店了
I haven't been in a hotel that wasn't advertised as "family friendly" in years.

386
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,690
我還是不敢相信 大衛奧唐納有孩子了
I still can't believe David O'Donnell procreated.

387
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,240
還是計劃生育
On purpose, anyway.

388
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,620
我記得某人曾吹噓說 唯一稱你為“爸爸”的人
Yeah, I seem to remember someone bragging that the only people that would call you Daddy

389
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,120
是跟你睡過的女人
were the women you slept with.

390
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,870
我現在還跟叫我“爸爸”的人一起睡
I still sleep with people who call me Daddy.

391
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,290
如果外面打雷 我還是跟三個一起睡
Sometimes all three of them if it's thundering outside.

392
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,170
你很快就會知道的 迪克森
You'll find out soon enough, Dixon.

393
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,960
- 你懷孕了  - 什么
You're pregnant? What?

394
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,590
沒有
No. Shit no.

395
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,460
她訂婚了 怎么 你不知道
No, she's engaged. What, you didn't know?

396
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,720
終于有人套住了我們的小母馬
Someone finally lassoed our little filly.

397
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,800
不
No,

398
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,350
我不知道
I, um, didn't...

399
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,390
關于訂婚那事 你們不必留時間過來了
Yeah. Well, about that, you guys can, uh, unsave the date.

400
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,440
好家伙 真的
Fuck. Seriously?

401
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,520
你了解我的 我一直是個數字女孩 一直都有人生計劃
Yeah, I mean, you know me. I've always been a numbers gal, always had a life plan.

402
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,450
計劃在一定的年齡 某一年結婚
Plan said to get married at a certain age, certain year.

403
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,950
然后 一天 我看到了他手機上的短信
And then one day, I see text messages on his phone.

404
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,370
說:“嘿 親愛的 等不及周五見面了
It says, "Hey, sweetheart, can't wait to see you Friday.

405
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,490
-“我愛你”等等 - 不是吧
I miss you." And all of that.

406
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,000
沒人能對迪克森不忠
No. No one steps out on Dixon.

407
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,540
顯然他也不行
Not even him, apparently.

408
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,790
短信是他即將來拜訪的侄女發的
Text messages were from his niece who was visiting.

409
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,840
但我發現當我以為他出軌時
But I realized that when I thought he was cheating,

410
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,090
我...
I was, uh...

411
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
我松了一口氣
I was relieved.

412
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,760
他是個很正直的人 我...
I mean, he's a decent man. I...

413
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,600
如果你要和某人共度一生
I don't know, if you're gonna spend the rest of your life with somebody,

414
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,690
難道你不想感受一些 舒服之外的東西嗎
don't you want to feel something more than comfort?

415
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,230
難道你不想覺得刺激
I mean, don't you want to feel excitement,

416
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,440
當你看見他時 有一點震動的感覺嗎
a little jolt of something when you see him?

417
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,570
有那么一刻 我以為 我會平靜且毫無內疚地擺脫婚姻
Anyways, you know, for a moment I thought I was gonna get out of it with no mess and no guilt,

418
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,700
但相反 我擺脫了婚姻...
but instead, I got out of it with...

419
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,160
卻非常混亂 滿滿的負罪感
A lot of mess and a whole lot of guilt.

420
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,000
答對了
Bingo.

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,750
這對你來說是好事
Good for you.

422
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,500
卡拉迪克森沒有安定下來
Karla Dixon doesn't settle.

423
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,330
謝謝
Thank you.

424
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,840
因此我接了臥底工作
That's actually why I took the undercover job.

425
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,050
花一點時間遠離這一切
Take a little time away from it all.

426
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,800
給我解釋一下 你怎么會同時當臥底和法務會計的
Explain to me how undercover work and forensic accounting go together?

427
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,060
首席執行官從德州一家公司 侵吞了數百萬美元
Well, um, CEO embezzling millions from a company down in Texas,

428
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,600
那里每個人都攜帶槍支 如果被逼到絕路 他絕對會用武器
where everybody's packing some kind of heat, and he was the kind of guy to use it if cornered,

429
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,440
所以除了數字分析之外 還有一點吸引力
so got a little intrigue along with the number-crunching.

430
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,860
好吧
All right.

431
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,150
你呢 內格利
And what about you, Neagley?

432
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,990
我每次查看領英網 都看到你升職了
Every time I check my LinkedIn, you're getting promoted again.

433
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,570
我過得很好
I'm having fun.

434
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,990
解決了大案子 現在帶團隊
On big cases, running a team now.

435
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,740
我之前試著 跟一家龐大的軟件公司簽合同
Trying to land this huge software company as a client.

436
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,700
我成功了 從那份值錢的合同里面收獲頗豐
I pull it off, I get a taste of that fat contract.

437
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,830
賺了不少錢啊
Making it rain.

438
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,210
我別無選擇 我想給我爸請全天候護理
No choice. I really want to get my dad on round-the-clock nursing care

439
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,000
給他租個離我近的房子 但那需要錢
and rent him a nice place closer to me, but that takes capital.

440
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,880
為什么要租呢 直接買下來
Why rent? Buy and build equity.

441
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,840
不 搞套公寓 合作社就是他媽的香蕉共和國
Get a condo. Co-ops are fucking banana republics.

442
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,880
是啊
Yeah.

443
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,810
你呢 大狗狗 幾乎音信全無
What about you, big dog? Being awfully quiet over there.

444
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,890
置業就像養蛇當寵物 或參加交際舞比賽
Home ownership is like keeping snakes as pets or ballroom dancing competitions.

445
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,770
如果你對此感興趣 那沒問題
Fine, if that's what you're into.

446
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,980
- 但我不喜歡 - 那你覺得穩定的工作有吸引力嗎
I just don't see the appeal. Or the appeal of a steady job.

447
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,650
企業界似乎跟軍隊也沒什么區別
Corporate world doesn't seem that different from the Army,

448
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,530
總感覺像是個牢籠
and that always felt a little like a cage.

449
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,950
只是不知道其他的事情
Just didn't know anything else.

450
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,620
我之前在酒吧里 有人演奏《狼嚎》
Then one day I was in a bar, and someone plays Howlin' Wolf

451
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,580
歌唱夜晚路過的火車
singing about trains going by in the night.

452
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,580
那聽起來像是真正的自由
That sounded like real freedom to me.

453
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,920
你像博科思卡爾威利一樣 跳上貨運列車
Are you jumping on freight trains like Boxcar Willie?

454
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
有時
Sometimes.

455
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,760
大多數時候 我坐公交車或搭便車
Mostly I take buses or hitchhike.

456
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,720
哪種瘋子才會讓世界上 塊頭最大的流浪漢上車啊
What kind of lunatic is picking up the world's biggest drifter?

457
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,680
- 他們很有意思 - 你在哪里吃飯
They can be interesting. Where do you eat?

458
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,520
我從窗臺上偷餡餅
I steal pie off windowsills.

459
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,310
- 我說真的 - 小飯館
I'm being serious. Diners.

460
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,270
有時讓我搭便車的人 會分享食物 跟我一起吃飯
Sometimes people who pick me up share a meal with me.

461
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,650
- 有時是我分享給他們 - 你睡哪兒
Sometimes I share with them. Where do you sleep?

462
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,200
大多數時候住在廉價汽車旅館里
Cheap motels mostly.

463
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,660
如果你找不到汽車旅館呢
And what if you can't find one?

464
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,410
停泊在碼頭的無人看管的船只 也很適合住一晚
Unattended boats in marinas are good for a night.

465
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,040
熄火的卡車的平板也適合
Flatbeds of parked trucks.

466
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,080
有一次 我在發現的吊床上 睡了個好覺
Had a great night's sleep in a hammock I spotted in some guy's backyard once

467
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,080
- 可惜灑水器澆滅了我的美夢 - 天啊
till the sprinklers went off. Good God, man.

468
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,170
- 你還真是一根棍和一塊布就走天下 - 行李太多了
All you need is a stick and a bindle. Too much luggage.

469
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,840
還有問題嗎
Any more questions?

470
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,720
有 只有一個
Yeah, just one.

471
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,760
你從來不覺得孤單嗎
Don't you ever get lonely?

472
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,290
任您吃自助餐

473
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,290
有人把標語當成個人挑戰了呀
Looks like someone took the sign as a personal challenge.

474
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,920
多琳 我只是在熱身
Doreen, I'm just warming up.

475
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,590
如果你喜歡晚餐 請務必試一下尼普頓的自助早餐
If you liked the dinner, make sure to try Neptune's breakfast buffet.

476
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,840
每天早上六點開始
Every day, starting at 6:00 a.m.

477
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,760
謝謝
Thank you.

478
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,830
看來我不是唯一一個睡不著的
Looks like I'm not the only one who couldn't sleep.

479
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,460
數字讓我放松
Numbers relax me.

480
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,840
如果我要做點數學計算 不如順便賺點錢 我要叫停
Figured if I was gonna do math, I might as well make some walking-around money. Stand.

481
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,630
你的兩只手上顯示的是十和八
Ma'am, you're showing ten and eight on two of your hands.

482
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:27,050
沒錯 我可以加倍下注 賭上一切換取更大的回報
That's right. And I could double down and risk it all for a potentially larger payout.

483
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,310
或者我也可以叫停 保證能獲勝
Or I could stand and have a guaranteed win

484
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,720
因為下一張牌亮牌時 你就輸光了
because the next card out of that shoe is gonna bust you.

485
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,770
我祖母曾經說 “不可人心不足蛇吞象”
My grandmother always said, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

486
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,940
她可不是蛇
She's no hog.

487
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,610
我不是蛇 所以我要叫停
I'm no hog, so I'm gonna stand.

488
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,110
如你所愿
As you wish.

489
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,320
十五
15...

490
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,740
太多了
Too many.

491
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,910
恭喜你 女士
Congratulations, ma'am.

492
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,450
你今晚非常幸運
You're having a very lucky night.

493
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,200
我們想請你去聽音樂會 慶祝一下
Maybe you'd like to celebrate with a concert on us?

494
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,040
- 謝謝 - 八十年代的女士們
Thank you. Ladies of the '80s.

495
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,120
黛比吉布森 蒂芙尼和泰勒戴恩 會表演她們最熱門的歌曲
Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, and Taylor Dane performing their biggest hits.

496
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,870
你可以趕上下半場
If you hurry, you can actually catch the second half.

497
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,330
但我玩得很開心
But I'm having fun.

498
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,250
我們知道你在算牌
Ma'am, we know you're counting cards.

499
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,460
用腦子算牌是合法的
Which isn't illegal if you do it in your head.

500
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,680
但鑒于你們的安全主管 好心給我們安排了一間套房
But seeing that your chief of security was kind enough to comp us a suite,

501
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,720
我就放你們一馬吧
I'll cut you some slack.

502
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,310
動動你的肌肉 把這些籌碼送到收銀窗口去
Want to use those muscles and help me carry these to the cashier window?

503
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,560
把這些票給穿著會員專用夾克的人
And you can give these tickets to the guy in the Members Only jacket.

504
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,060
他看起來很喜歡八十年代的女士
He looks like he would enjoy some '80s ladies.

505
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,090
謝謝你陪我
Thanks for coming with.

506
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,390
深夜散步總能讓我頭腦清醒
Late-night walks always clear my head,

507
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,470
我收到內格利發來說弗朗茨死了的 短信后 我的腦子就一直有點亂
and after the text I got from Neagley about Franz, my head's been kind of cloudy, you know?

508
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,520
是啊
Yeah.

509
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,730
我很驚訝你口袋里 裝著賭場賺來的那些錢還能散步
I'm surprised you can walk at all with all the casino's money in your pockets.

510
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,480
我猜法務會計會在稅款申報的時候 附上這一筆錢吧
Can I assume the forensic accountant's gonna declare that cash on her taxes?

511
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,110
那些騙子
Those crooks?

512
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,160
要是我能審計某人的話 那簡直是我夢想的工作
If there's anybody I could audit... Actually, it's kind of my dream job.

513
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,240
現在的工作滿足不了你嗎
Current gig doesn't give you your auditing fix?

514
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,540
不行 我正在抓一個 從億萬富翁那里偷錢的百萬富翁
No, I'm just busting millionaires from stealing from billionaires.

515
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,250
我想做的是追查 政府的腐敗和浪費行為
What I really want to do is go after government corruption and waste.

516
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,380
你以前在山姆大叔手下工作過
Oh, you used to work for Uncle Sam.

517
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,250
- 六百美元的坐便圈 - 沒錯
You know what I'm talking about. $600 toilet seats. Exactly.

518
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,630
如果稅收能被有效使用 我們可以修路和橋梁
I mean, if tax money was spent efficiently, honestly, we could fix roads and bridges

519
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,680
以及學校 我們可以幫助需要幫助的人
and schools. Like, we could help people who actually need help.

520
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,600
我們可以有所作為
We could make a difference.

521
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,970
你應該這么做
You should do it.

522
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,020
是啊
Yeah.

523
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,150
我考慮過自己成立非營利監督組織
Well, I looked into starting my own nonprofit watchdog group,

524
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,940
但啟動成本讓人望而卻步
but start-up costs are prohibitive.

525
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,070
第一步總是最難的
First step's always the hardest.

526
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,070
是的
Yeah.

527
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,120
這就是我們以前 從沒有發生過關系的原因嗎
Is that why, back in the day, you and I never happened?

528
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,950
第一步是最難的
First steps were the hardest?

529
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,420
你在酒店房間里喝了多少
How much did you drink back at the hotel room?

530
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,460
足夠我問你那個問題了
Enough to ask you that question.

531
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,090
快說 我以前給過你提示
I mean, come on, Reacher. It's not like I didn't drop any hints.

532
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,430
當時我是你的老大
I was your boss.

533
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,260
那樣做不對
It wouldn't have been right.

534
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,730
我等了好幾年才等到這個答案 不愧是你雷徹的作風
Wow. [sighs] Well, I waited years for that answer, and it's pure Reacher.

535
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,360
直接 誠實且有理有據
Direct, honest and well-reasoned.

536
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,620
我能再問你個問題嗎
So, can I ask you another question?

537
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,370
你想怎么對付那兩個跟蹤我們的人
What do you want to do about the two guys that are following us?

538
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,750
- 你什么時候發現的  - 我們離開賭場時就發現了
When'd you spot them? Ooh, when we left the casino.

539
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,960
我以為他們是看到我們兌的現金 想搶劫我們
Figure they saw us cashing out and now they're gonna try to rob us.

540
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,510
我本來也是這么想的
That's what I thought, too.

541
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,920
看見停在那邊
But see that car

542
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,340
- 有紐約臨時牌照的車了嗎  - 怎么了
parked up the street with the New York dealer tags? Yeah.

543
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,470
我們進城時 它在高速路上跟著我們
Pretty sure it was behind us on the expressway when we came into town.

544
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,930
我們經過它時 肯定會有個持槍的男人走出來
Also, pretty sure when we walk by it, a man with a gun will step out.

545
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,230
我們轉身逃跑時 我們身后的人 不會離得那么遠
Then, when we turn to run, the guys behind us won't be so far behind anymore.

546
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,810
計劃是什么
So what's the plan?

547
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,770
我們不會經過那輛車
We're not gonna walk by that car.

548
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,610
我說“走” 就翻過柵欄
On my "go," over the fence.

549
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
走
Go.

550
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,490
他媽的
Fuck.

551
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,910
走
Go, go.

552
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,500
好的 因為你打了那個警察 肯定會發布你的逮捕令
Okay, there's got to be a warrant out for you in New York for hitting that cop.

553
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,050
如果我們在住宅區開槍 警察就會被叫來 你會被關起來
We open fire in a residential area, cops get called, you get locked up.

554
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,510
我們別用槍
Let's do this without guns.

555
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,880
看起來他們也是這么想的
Looks like they have the same idea.

556
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,970
需要我幫你處理你負責的人嗎
Need help with yours?

557
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,060
我能處理
I'll manage.

558
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,900
該死 我們小時候 會把名字寫在混凝土里
Damn, Reacher. When we were kids, we just wrote our names in it.

559
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,610
是賭場里穿著會員專用夾克的男人
It's the Members Only jacket guy from the casino.

560
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,530
媽的 如果他們追殺我們 他們可能也會去追殺內格利和奧唐納
Oh, shit. If they went after us, they might go after Neagley and O'Donnell, too.

561
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,660
不會 他們一直等到我們離開 木板人行道才動手
No, they waited until we were off the boardwalk to make their move.

562
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,500
他們不會去 到處都是監控的繁忙的酒店
They're not gonna go into a busy hotel with cameras everywhere.

563
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,580
沒有身份證
No I.D.

564
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,130
我們搜一下這個混蛋的車
Let's search this asshole's car.

565
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,890
看起來有人做了功課
Looks like someone did their homework.

566
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,070
手機
Phone.

567
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,620
成了嗎
Is it done?

568
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,330
成是成了 就是跟你想的不一樣
Not in the way you expected.

569
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,130
你惹錯人了
You're fucking with the wrong guy, Reacher.

570
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,880
你應該知道你不會有好下場的
You should know that this doesn't end well for you.

571
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,170
那為什么是你聽起來在瑟瑟發抖
Then why are you the one that sounds scared?

572
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,010
- 我覺得我引起他的注意了 - 我們要追蹤號碼嗎
Think I got his attention. Should we trace the number?

573
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,350
這是一次性手機 剛才接電話那人也會用一次性手機
This is a burner. Guy on the other end will be using a burner, too.

574
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,150
臨時牌照是幽靈車牌 車牌號已經被刮掉了
Dealer tags are most likely ghost plates, VIN's been scratched off.

575
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,360
沒什么能指認他們身份的東西
Nothing to I.D. any of them.

576
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,690
這些人都是專業殺手
These guys are pros.

577
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,400
我們應該留個活口的
We should've left one of them alive.

578
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,280
是啊 他們沒給我們很多選擇
Yeah, but they didn't give us much of a choice, did they?

579
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,740
也許沒有 現在我們的線索斷了
Maybe not. Now we have nothing to go on.

580
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,870
不一定
Not necessarily.

581
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,710
停車場通行證
Parking lot pass.

582
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,670
-“新時代科技” - 對
"New Age Technologies." Yeah.

583
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,460
昨天早上蓋的章
Stamped yesterday morning.

584
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,250
這就是你口中的線索
I think it's what you call a clue.

585
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
我們怎么處理尸體
Now what are we gonna do about those bodies?

586
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,510
我有個主意
I have an idea.

587
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,030
我口渴了
I'm thirsty.

588
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,110
想喝啤酒嗎
Want to get a beer?

589
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,170
新時代有什么發現嗎
Anything on New Age?

590
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,010
有
Yeah,

591
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,180
看起來新時代是一家航空航天公司
looks like New Age is an aerospace company.

592
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,890
跟大西洋城有聯系嗎
Any ties to Atlantic City?

593
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,270
我看沒有 它的總部設在紐約
Not that I can see. Headquarters are based in New York.

594
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,190
有一塊彈片打中我了 剛才太過刺激 我沒注意
Looks like a piece of shrapnel bit me. I didn't notice with all the adrenaline pumping.

595
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,400
幾乎沒傷到你
Barely winged you.

596
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,360
這里...
Here.

597
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,250
你在干什么
What you doing?

598
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,290
給傷口抹酒精很疼 我媽以前就這么做
What my mom used to do when the alcohol stung.

599
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,670
你可能只把細菌吹進去了
You know, you're probably just blowing germs into it.

600
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,970
可能吧 但感覺很好
Probably. But it feels good.

601
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,810
謝謝
Thanks.

602
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,930
不用謝
Welcome.

603
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,280
你知道 雷徹
You know, Reacher,

604
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,660
有時感覺孤單是很正常的
it's perfectly normal to be lonely sometimes.

605
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,080
任何人像你這么過日子都會孤單
Anyone living their life the way you do would.

606
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,120
今晚你不必孤單
But you don't have to be lonely tonight.

607
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,920
而且你也不再是我的老大了
And you're not my boss anymore.

608
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,710
科羅拉多州丹佛市外32公里處

609
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,240
所有六千五百萬都將裝在卡車里
All 650 will be in the truck.

610
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,700
你可以用我在車上 裝的GPS定位器追蹤
You can track the shipment with the GPS locater I paired to this.

611
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,490
路上至少標記了兩個好的伏擊點
There are at least two good ambush points marked on the route.

612
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,490
很好
Excellent.

613
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,290
我的人會處理剩下的事
My men will take care of the rest.

614
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
那武器呢
And the weapons?

615
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,540
都會在海外使用嗎 這是說好了的
They'll all be used overseas? I was told that was the deal.

616
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,790
那當然
Absolutely.

617
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,220
卡車司機不會受到傷害吧
And the, and the truck driver won't be harmed?

618
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,430
當然
Of course.

619
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,760
我永遠不會傷害任何人
I would never harm anyone.

620
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,620
- 早上好 迪克森 - 我們需要談談昨晚的事
Morning, Dixon. We need to talk to you about what happened last night.

621
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,950
整個酒店都聽到昨天的動靜了
Oh, the whole hotel heard what happened last night.

622
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,250
我就說你聲音很大
Told you you were loud.

623
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,920
這是昨天在從紐約就開始 跟蹤我們的車里找到的
Found this in a car that followed us down from New York yesterday.

624
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,460
司機怎么了
What happened to the driver?

625
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,920
他不會跟我們回去
He won't be following us back.

626
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,710
他的那兩個朋友也不會
Neither will his two friends.

627
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,760
媽的
Shit.

628
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,350
- 是誰  - 賴特
Who is it? Wright.

629
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,850
安全
Clear.

630
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,680
進來
Come on in.

631
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,060
你們看起來有點緊張啊
You, uh, you folks seem a little jumpy.

632
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,900
鑒于目前的情況 我不能怪你們
I mean, I don't blame you, given the circumstances.

633
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,530
我很討厭傳達更多壞消息 但我調查這些事情時
And I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but when I was looking into things,

634
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,330
大西洋城警察局跟我說 他們在紐約北部發現了兩具尸體
Atlantic City PD told me that two more bodies have been discovered in Upstate New York,

635
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,700
就在他們發現你們朋友的地方附近
near where they found your other friend.

636
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,170
從分解情況來看 他們已經在那兒有段時間了
Judging by the decomposition, they'd been there a while.

637
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,380
我拿到了一份警察報告副本
Got a copy of the police report for you.

638
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,630
很容易借此識別其身份
Pretty easy to I.D. him with that.

639
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,070
他參軍時 他姐姐很害怕
When he joined the Army, his sister was terrified

640
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,360
他會傷痕累累地死去
he'd be killed with some disfiguring wounds.

641
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,070
她永遠不會知道發生了什么
She'd never know what happened to him.

642
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,780
就說他的兵牌可能被炸掉
Said his dog tags could be blown off.

643
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,040
為了安撫她 他在后背上 文了他的名字和服役編號
To calm her down, he got his name and service number tattooed across his back.

644
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,120
看起來很可笑
Looked ridiculous.

645
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,960
他不在乎
