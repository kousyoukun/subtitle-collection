1
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:57,856
You lied.

2
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,166
I'm not free.

3
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:03,369
Well, you got that right,
asshole.

4
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,541
It's your own damned fault,

5
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:10,460
thinking you could cheat death.

6
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:13,129
Mm-mm.

7
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:28,361
Help...

8
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:35,985
Help!

9
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:40,707
Help!

10
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,825
Help!

11
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,213
Help!

12
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:51,718
Help!

13
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:54,337
Help!

14
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,172
Can't you shut her up?

15
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:58,508
I can hear her through the duct.

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,226
Did you forget
a cop is staying here?

17
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,512
He's away at work.

18
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:04,077
She'll stop.

19
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,899
She always gives up
after a minute.

20
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,271
See?

21
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:14,607
Yuck. Tastes gross.

22
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:22,698
That's 'cause she's dead.

23
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:23,833
Stop.

24
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:54,864
It's a horror!

25
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:57,984
I'll have to use ammonia
to refresh these linens.

26
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:05,074
I've always admired
the Swedes and their chocolate.

27
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:06,876
It's a wonder they stay so thin.

28
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,961
Chocolate's the Swiss.

29
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,777
Get some juice and cookies.

30
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,044
That's the last of it.

31
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,496
Thank you.

32
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,416
Where's Donovan?
Getting dressed, I hope.

33
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:40,140
It's just been a while
since I've seen him--

34
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:47,193
You're torturing that woman.

35
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:52,014
I was a junkie because I wanted
to escape from my mother.

36
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,400
You made it so I never can.

37
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,821
Why haven't you changed?

38
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:01,691
We're going to miss the opening.

39
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:04,026
We don't have space
for any more art.

40
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:17,006
Ah...

41
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,041
Besides...

42
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:21,183
you don't have the money, babe.

43
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,515
We're not going
for the art, dumbass.

44
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,721
We're going for the hunt.

45
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,105
We just fed.

46
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,893
Come on.
Let's stay in.

47
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,396
We could binge-watch
<i>House of Cards.</i>

48

51
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,232
You're very brave, Max.

52
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,830
We're almost done here.

53
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,956
Do you think
that this could be strep?

54
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,668
I looked on WebMD
and they said...

55
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,563
Stay off the Internet.

56
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,108
It'll only make your head spin.

57
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:35,978
Can you breathe in for me, Max?

58
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,848
He sounds terrible, doesn't he?

59
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,688
Hang in there.

60
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,692
We're gonna get you all better.

61
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,525
Don't worry.

62
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,777
I'm just gonna talk to your
mom for a minute, okay?

63
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,329
Your son has the measles.

64
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,164
Oh, the measles?

65
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,499
Thank God.

66
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,945
I thought it was
something serious.

67
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,372
The measles are serious,
Mrs. Ellison.

68
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,388
And completely unnecessary.

69
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,173
If you had followed my advice

70
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,680
and had Max vaccinated,
then we wouldn't be...

71
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,121
We did what we thought was right.

72
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:25,695
Okay, all that stuff out there how vaccines
can lead to autism,

73
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,565
how can they actually kill people...

74
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,899
Measles kill people.

75
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,568
Children.

76
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,019
Millions in the
developing world,

77
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,351
until pretty recently.

78
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:35,712
But you don't live in the
developing world, Mrs. Ellison.

79
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,491
You live on the West Side
of Los Angeles.

80
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,443
And believe me, there are
plenty of real threats

81
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,883
right outside these doors
for you to be worried about.

82
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:52,506
Look, our children are at risk
from so much in this world.

83
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,126
We can never protect them from
all of it.

84
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,844
But when there's something
we can do

85
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,263
to make them just a little
bit safer, we do it.

86
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,219
So what's the treatment?

87
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,720
There isn't one.

88
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,056
Tylenol to keep his fever down,

89
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,369
lots of liquids.

90
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,193
And rest.

91
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,978
Something you won't be getting

92
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,503
in the next couple
weeks, I'm afraid.

93
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,733
Call me if his
fever spikes again.

94
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:20,951
Okay.

95
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,962
Turndown service?

96
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,515
No.

97
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:09,987
Holden!

98
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,908
Holden!

99
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,916
Holden!

100
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:26,003
Holden!

101
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,537
Holden!

102
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,240
Holden...

103
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:02,873
Are you looking for someone?

104
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,839
I guess not.

105
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:08,818
This place is
bat-shit crazy, you know.

106
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:14,134
Weird things go down,
especially at night.

107
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,304
You look like
you could use a drink.

108
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:21,642
Oh.

109
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,445
I know that look.

110
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,364
Hanging onto your sobriety
like it's the last train

111
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,481
out of Dodge.

112
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,404
Bring him a ginger ale,
Cleopatra.

113
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:39,460
The hour between 2:00 and 3:00
a.m. is always the worst.

114
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:51,074
So I take it you live here?

115
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,890
I do.

116
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,121
How long?

117
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,844
Too long.

118
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,847
And I'm not a hooker

119
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,899
if that's what you're wondering.

120
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,686
I wasn't.

121
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,439
I can't help
but wonder how come--

122
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,691
How come a girl like me ends
up with tracks in her arms

123
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,242
living in this dump?

124
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:18,115
That's one way to put it.

125
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,536
Patti Smith said that my poems

126
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,944
were like glass shattering.

127
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:29,426
I wrote a song with her.

128
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,212
And then she wrote me off.

129
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,715
Why?

130
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,301
'Cause of the smack?

131
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:44,224
Getting high used to be like
how you imagine heaven.

132
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,360
Pure light.

133
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,230
The perfection of it all.

134
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:53,484
Even in me.

135
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:00,407
Then I got lost.

136
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,294
Kept trying to climb higher.

137
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,081
Get closer to that light.

138
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,865
Like an endless ladder
where all you do

139
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,762
is get further and further away.

140
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:22,429
There's a part of you that wants
to get lost, am I right?

141
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,485
Climb that ladder.

142
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,698
Tell me about your very last

143
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:43,667
drunk.

144
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,170
What kind of day was it?

145
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,962
I like details.

146
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,858
Started like most days.

147
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,312
<i>Multiple homicide</i>
<i>in Glassell Park.</i>

148
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,281
Dad here spent
the year in prison

149
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:15,578
for second-degree
assault.

150
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,958
We figure he couldn't
take the pressure,

151
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:20,896
so he poisons them all,

152
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:22,739
and blows his brains out.

153
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,498
Well, at least
they died peacefully.

154
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,531
What happens to a man

155
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:35,600
makes him murder his own kids?

156
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,869
He didn't.

157
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,750
<i>His power had been turned off,</i>

158
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,420
<i>so he brings in</i>
<i>a portable generator</i>

159
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,639
<i>so his kids can stay warm.</i>

160
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:08,193
Must have ran out of gas.

161
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:11,848
<i>Comes back from his night shift</i>

162
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:15,102
<i>finds his whole family dead</i>

163
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,290
<i>from carbon monoxide poisoning.</i>

164
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,992
<i>That's enough</i>
<i>to make a man shoot himself.</i>

165
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:26,747
I had two kids at the time.

166
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,500
Holden and Scarlett.

167
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,922
I didn't make it back home

168
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,958
for two days.

169
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,093
Then the day I came home,

170
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,212
I took the family to the beach.

171
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,963
Some kind of desperate gesture

172
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,434
to earn my wife's forgiveness.

173
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,853
It almost worked.

174
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:58,525
Holden! Holden!

175
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,447
But my son...

176
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,954
Holden?

177
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:07,738
I lost him.

178
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,567
I can't afford to get lost.

179
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:39,436
So, you were right
about our Bel Air vic.

180
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,105
He was pumped full
of male potency drugs.

181
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:43,594
Near lethal dose.

182
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,099
They still have him in induced coma.

183
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:47,582
Something interesting though.

184
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,662
Both victims had the same text
on their cellphone.

185
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,967
Messaged each other to
meet them at the Bel Air.

186
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:53,617
Only, they didn't
send them to each other.

187
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,662
You mean a third party
spoofed both their numbers?

188
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,499
Our killer has some tech savvy.

189
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,674
That's your mom.

190
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,092
We have to go.

191
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,216
John, you have a package.

192
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,017
A package?

193
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,469
Hotel Cortez.

194
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,020
That's where you're
staying, right?

195
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,114
Let's evacuate the building!

196
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,816
Get the bomb squad down here!

197
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:42,632
Okay.

198
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,673
It's not a bomb.

199
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,758
I mean, we can take it outside
and detonate it

200
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,426
if you want to be safe,

201
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,895
but you might want
to take a look first.

202
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,230
Thanks, Ted.
Yeah.

203
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,162
Congratulations.

204
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,614
Let's run this
down to the crime lab.

205
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,949
Packaging, everything.

206
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,450
Let's run this blood, too.

207
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,103
And see if it matches
any of our victims.

208
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:33,906
Claudia, you made it.

209
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:35,741
Will, this place.

210
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:37,332
It's marvelous!

211
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:40,162
It's like some sad whore that
stayed too long at the party.

212
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:41,831
I know.

213
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:43,113
I still can't decide
if I should renovate it

214
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,612
or just let it decay around me.

215
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,064
A lot of these fixtures
are original, you know.

216
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,449
Mmm.

217
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:51,181
Uh, can I help you
with something?

218
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,319
Just teaching the folks
from<i> Vogue</i> how to Vogue.

219
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,571
I couldn't resist.

220
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,539
The irony.

221
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,324
Skinny jeans are out,

222
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,993
fringe is in
and ponchos are forever.

223
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,046
Make a note of it.

224
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,747
You will spend the night?

225
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,082
Are you kidding me?
I'm spending the week.

226
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:07,884
I'll write about fashion.

227
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,253
And I'll sleep with history.

228
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,971
Tell me.

229
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,641
Does he comes with the building?

230
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:22,815
He's one of our residents.

231
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,100
Will Drake, new owner.

232
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,602
Right.

233
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:27,604
Claudia Bankson, <i>Vogue Magazine.</i>

234
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,322
Uh, didn't mean
to crash the party.

235
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:30,637
I'm just looking
for my daughter.

236
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,358
She was supposed
to be dropped off here.

237
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,527
Daddy!

238
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,698
Dad, guess what?

239
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:41,167
Officer Pettibone
let me run the siren!

240
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,169
Oh, Officer Pettibone
knows better.

241
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:44,754
She hit a triple at recess.

242
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,789
Oh, that's-that's my girl.

243
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,291
All right, thanks, Carl.
Sure.

244
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:49,542
Let's go.

245
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,211
Wow! You live here?

246
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,046
It doesn't always
look like this.

247
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,380
Is it a party?

248
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,266
It is, and you
and your father are invited.

249
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,717
Oh, thanks, but we have
our whole day planned.

250
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:59,469
Dad!

251
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:00,553
Honey, this is a grownup party.

252
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,721
No, it's-it....

253
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,473
She can sit with my son.
Lachlan!

254
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:05,391
Lachlan, this is Scarlett.
I'll take your tickets.

255
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,227
Come on, man!
Oh...

256
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,611
I need to be on this list.

257
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,729
Sorry, is there a problem here?

258
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:11,397
Yeah, I'm not on the list!

259
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,483
I'm not sure who you are.

260
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,151
I goddamn live here!

261
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:16,819
It's a private affair, dear.

262
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:18,238
The event's full.

263
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,405
Maybe next time.

264
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:22,408
Come on, man.

265
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,160
This is my house.

266
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:26,663
This is my house!
Get off of me!

267
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,209
This is my first fashion show.

268
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:45,481
My millionth.

269
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,767
Maybe later I'll show you
something really cool.

We're so bored with each other.

283
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,999

He's full of rage.

I can still smell it.

You need to get
your shit together.

307
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:21,687
The show is not over.

308
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:25,818
It is for me.

309
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,661
I'm done with modeling.

310
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,803
You can't tell anyone
about this.

311
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:45,671
It has to be our secret.

312
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,340
I mean it.

Watch.

316
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,419
What do you think you're doing?

317
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:39,887
I know there's coke in here.

318
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,439
I can smell it.

319
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:51,365
Stop

320
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,068
before you make me stop you.

321
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,402
Call the cops, man.

322
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,539
I don't give a shit.

323
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:59,156
I'm coming out in a
Lars Von Trier movie next year.

324
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,086
I've made a rule

325
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,637
to stay away from junkies,

326
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:17,355
but I'm gonna make
an exception with you.

327
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,153
Let him go.

328
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,620
Hmm.

329
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:56,357
Let me assert my firm belief

330
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,692
that the only thing

331
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:00,494
we have to fear

332
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:03,030
is fear itself.

333
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:21,844
Shit!

334
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,463
Take any piece you like.

335
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:20,304
None of it has
any meaning for me.

336
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,360
You look like you need a drink.

337
00:34:25,245 --> 00:34:27,197
I'm good.

338
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:34,288
Oh.

339
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,706
Bolivian marching powder.

340
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,479
Too tame for my taste.

341
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,688
***

342
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:44,373
I've tried it all, man.

343
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:45,968
There is nothing better.

344
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:47,339
You know.

345
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:51,343
In your black heart of hearts,
you know.

346
00:34:52,863 --> 00:34:54,744
You're just like me.

347
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:58,645
I don't think so, dude.

348
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,931
Well, I had it all once.

349
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,169
Fortune, fame.

350
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:06,102
But nothing satisfied.

351
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:09,772
"To thine own self be true."

352
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,101
Polonius.

353
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,540
I'll show you what
you've been dreaming of.

354
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,424
Yes, sir?

355
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,299
Stop your sniveling.

356
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,351
I found this one
in the bar, sir.

357
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,470
Prostituting herself.

358
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,056
Ah.
There's nothing she won't do for a dollar.

359
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,692
Sorry, man,
bondage really bores me.

360
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,111
Me, too.

361
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,979
Pull the trigger

362
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,481
and take her last breath.

363
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,984
It's exhilarating.

364
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:55,902
You're crazy.

365
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,564
Get off me, man.

366
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:08,502
Well...

367
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:09,499
No!

368
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:15,054
You got to go out and grab life.

369
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,083
Oh! Jesus!

370
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,635
Laundress?
Yes, sir?

371
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:23,172
Replace the linens.

372
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:24,340
Right away, sir.

373
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:25,507
I'll get the ammonia.

374
00:36:25,593 --> 00:36:27,726
What a glorious stain!

375
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,798
What took you so long?

376
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,768
You know who I am?

377
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:34,530
Scarlett.

378
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:51,519
Do you remember them?

379
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:52,987
That's Mom.

380
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:55,155
Dad.

381
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,407
And that's me and that's you.

382
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,492
But you're different now.

383
00:39:02,914 --> 00:39:04,736
I grew up.

384
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:06,444
Why haven't you?

385
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:14,484
Mom and dad will be so
happy when they see you.

386
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:15,904
They thin you're dead.

387
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,396
Let's go home now.

388
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:23,566
I am home.

389
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:25,518
I like it here.

390
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:28,071
You can come

391
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:29,939
to visit whenever you want.

392
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,698
Can I take a picture?

393
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,756
Okay, here we go.

394
00:40:01,723 --> 00:40:02,939
Oh.

395
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:25,128
Kids are the best.

396
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:00,113
If you could just ask Wendy

397
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,423
if she can think of anything,

398
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,194
anything she may have said
or if she saw her with someone.

399
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:07,537
Why can't I patch in
to the cameras downtown

400
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:09,256
from my laptop here at home?

401
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,384
But she's been gone
for five hours!

402
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,515
It's a long time when a psycho
has your private number!

403
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:13,908
Daddy?

404
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,918
Oh, my God!

405
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,357
Where have you been?

406
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:28,775
Are you okay?

407
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,893
Are you hurt?

408
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:30,634
Did somebody take you?

409
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,562
I went on the bus.

410
00:41:32,648 --> 00:41:33,897
To your hotel.

411
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,980
Alone?

412
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,239
Yes.

413
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:37,796
Jesus Christ, Scarlett.

414
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:40,904
Jesus Christ,
you can't do that to us!

415
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,372
I'm sorry, Mommy.

416
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:43,313
How did this happen?

417
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:45,825
Mom, I pretended
to go to the bathroom

418
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:47,425
and then climbed out the window.

419
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,630
I know the police guy
couldn't go in there.

420
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,084
I wanted to see
if it was really him.

421
00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:55,418
I wanted to surprise you.

422
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,551
What are you talking about?

423
00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:59,251
You wanted to see who, Scar?

424
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:01,276
Holden.

425
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,592
He's at your hotel.

426
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:10,433
H-Holden is dead, Scarlett.

427
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,102
No.

428
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,103
I saw him.

429
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,030
I was just talking with him.

430
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,535
No, you weren't!

431
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:17,616
He's dead, and he's never
coming back, all right?

432
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,110
So stop saying that!

433
00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:21,745
I'm not a liar.

434
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:23,968
Look, I took a picture.

435
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:26,037
I saw him, and he was real,

436
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:27,751
and you lied to me.
No.

437
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:29,452
You said he was dead,
but I saw him.

438
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:40,861
Jesus Christ, I can't
believe you made me

439
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:41,945
go through this again.

440
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:43,653
You think Holden was my fault?

441
00:42:47,222 --> 00:42:49,139
I'm sorry, I'm very tired.

442
00:42:49,224 --> 00:42:51,057
I'm going to bed.

443
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:13,163
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

444
00:43:13,248 --> 00:43:14,881
<i>I look amazing.</i>

445
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:20,326
I would do me.

446
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,556
No zits, no blackheads.

447
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,008
Mmm.

448
00:43:25,093 --> 00:43:28,261
All that crystal
was wrecking my skin,

449
00:43:28,347 --> 00:43:30,063
making me look like
something on that Web site,

450
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,299
"Faces of Meth."

451
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,803
Now I look what, like

452
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:36,146
twenty-four.

453
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:38,938
God damn.

454
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:42,464
The beauty of the virus
is you never age.

455
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:46,780
You now have a supercharged
immune system.

456
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:48,773
Can a bullet take me out?

457
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,730
A silver bullet or a stake?

458
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,370
Bitch, please, of course it can.

459
00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:58,341
You're only immortal
if you're smart.

460
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:23,066
No fangs?

461
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:24,484
We don't bite.

462
00:44:24,604 --> 00:44:26,202
We cut.

463
00:44:26,238 --> 00:44:27,737
Harder, harder.

464
00:44:27,823 --> 00:44:28,822
Harder.

465
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:37,213
Never
drink from the dead.

466
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,257
Avoid the diseased, the
feeble, the polluted.

467
00:44:42,377 --> 00:44:44,525
Bad blood is like a...

468
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:47,424
a bad flu or worse.

469
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:49,030
Coffins?

470
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:52,812
I prefer blackout curtains
and a Duxiana bed.

471
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,759
The sun won't kill you,

472
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:58,401
but it should be avoided.

473
00:44:58,437 --> 00:45:00,737
It will sap your vitality.

474
00:45:00,772 --> 00:45:02,272
Huh.

475
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:07,444
<i>Bellissimo.</i>

476
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,412
What?

477
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:14,784
Nothing, you just remind
me so much of someone.

478
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:18,922
You know what I can't wait for?

479
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:21,015
To hunt Kendall Jenner.

480
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,196
Bitch blew me off
once at Coachella.

481
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:25,339
Can I kill her?

482
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:28,848
The only thing
that can undo you now

483
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,351
is your own recklessness.

484
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,922
Just don't get caught.

485
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:38,372
And don't fall in love.

486
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:44,864
That's the part you save for me.

487
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:50,566
Forever.

488
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:54,080
How old are you?

489
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:59,212
I was born in 1904.

490
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,359
Who turned you?

491
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:06,222
One who is even
more beautiful than you.

492
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:09,639
But he's long gone now.

493
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,978
So you'll have to do.

494
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,847
Shit.

495
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:21,351
So you lived through, like,
the wars and the depression

496
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,987
and... Clinton
and everything.

497
00:46:25,331 --> 00:46:27,991
What was your favorite time?

498
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,583
Every decade has its
decadence period.

499
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,250
That's when I'm most alive.

500
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:41,464
I loved the late 1970s the most.

<i>The darkness was the light.</i>

513

I mourn it still.

521
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:42,240
I think about everything
that could have been,

522
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,351
had they all lived, my friends.

523
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:50,240
Andy, Keith.

524
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:54,661
Robert.

525
00:47:57,193 --> 00:48:00,221
All that... loss.

526
00:48:01,018 --> 00:48:03,000
Were those guys you killed?

527
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:07,259
***

528
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:10,691
You wanted to say it to my face?

529
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:13,098
I just did.

530
00:48:13,322 --> 00:48:15,548
Tristan, would you give
us a minute?

531
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:20,470
Yeah, sure.

532
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:51,968
I can't believe you turned him.

533
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:57,173
He's a stupid trashy model.

534
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:01,427
And you were a pathetic addict
dying on a filthy floor.

535
00:49:08,118 --> 00:49:10,436
I didn't want to hurt you.

536
00:49:10,522 --> 00:49:13,523
I still don't.

537
00:49:13,608 --> 00:49:16,943
There's no reason
this has to end badly.

538
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:19,112
End?

539
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,666
Are you throwing me out?

540
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,676
I love you.

541
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,810
I love you.

542
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:44,174
And I love you.

543
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:46,649
But you will learn--

544
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:50,096
it isn't our precious
virus that makes you.

545
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:54,100
It isn't who you kill

546
00:49:54,186 --> 00:49:56,152
or who you screw.

547
00:49:56,238 --> 00:49:59,144
It's the heartbreaks.

548
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:03,056
The bigger, the better.

549
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:10,917
I know better than any of us.

550
00:50:15,173 --> 00:50:17,912
I'll let you pack your things.

551
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:29,269
You said,

552
00:50:29,304 --> 00:50:32,522
when you brought me back
from the brink of death,

553
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:34,557
that it was the closest
thing you ever had

554
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:35,976
to a spiritual experience.
You tell me...

555
00:50:36,061 --> 00:50:38,812
you tell me you felt that
when you made him.

556
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:40,363
Honestly...

557
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:41,731
<i>it was...</i>

558
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:43,900
<i>one of the most...</i>

559
00:50:43,986 --> 00:50:45,819
<i>erotic...</i>

560
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:47,821
<i>moments...</i>

561
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:50,373
<i>of my life.</i>

562
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:26,242
Hey there, handsome.

563
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:27,794
Rough day?

564
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:30,213
Oh, cowboy, we don't
allow guests back here.

565
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:33,709
Don't think of me as a guest,
think of me as the angry father

566
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,501
whose daughter you let
roam these halls today.

567
00:51:35,587 --> 00:51:37,136
There's not a thing
that goes on in this place

568
00:51:37,172 --> 00:51:39,373
that you don't know about,
which makes you an accessory.

569
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:40,673
To what?

570
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:42,558
Murder, maybe kidnapping.

571
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,510
I'm done playing.

572
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:46,744
Aren't you gonna frisk me first?

573
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:49,766
Whew, it's been a long time

574
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:51,768
since a man spun me
around like that.

575
00:51:51,853 --> 00:51:54,854
If I was a few years younger,
I'd even enjoy the cuffs.

576
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:56,406
Oh, you're not gonna enjoy this,

577
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:57,971
believe me, until you
start telling me

578
00:51:58,026 --> 00:52:00,450
everything that's
going on in this place.

579
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:05,248
You've seen things.

580
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:06,916
You know I have.

581
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:09,702
Look, before you have
to explain to somebody

582
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:11,704
what you think you're
charging me with,

583
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:14,090
why don't you take
these bracelets off of me?

584
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,092
I'll tell you
what you want to know.

585
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,940
There's just one
thing you got to do.

586
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:31,974
What?

587
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,726
Ask nice.

588
00:52:33,812 --> 00:52:35,611
And buy a lady a drink.

589
00:52:53,728 --> 00:52:55,006
Is that your thing?

590
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:57,562
You need to be talked into drinking?

591
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:06,288
Cut the crap, ask me
what you really want to know.

592
00:53:06,323 --> 00:53:09,408
I want to know what's
going on in this place.

593
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:15,831
Well, if you want to know
what this place is about,

594
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:18,167
you have to know
about the man who built it--

595
00:53:18,252 --> 00:53:20,607
James Patrick March.

596
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,593
<i>He put atom of evil in his</i>
<i>being into building this hotel.</i>

597
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:30,479
<i>March was a self-made</i>
<i>man-- oil, coal.</i>

598
00:53:30,514 --> 00:53:32,398
<i>But he was new money,</i>

599
00:53:32,483 --> 00:53:35,317
<i>shunned by the elites</i>
<i>of East Coast society.</i>

600
00:53:35,352 --> 00:53:38,187
<i>So he came west, to a land</i>
<i>where pedigree meant little</i>

601
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:40,105
<i>if you had a lot of dough.</i>

602
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:43,525
<i>Here he would build a monument</i>
<i>to excess and opulence,</i>

603
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:46,361
<i>where he could satisfy</i>
<i>his own peculiar appetites.</i>

604
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:48,247
Uh, Mr. March?

605
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,032
Mr. March?!

606
00:53:50,117 --> 00:53:52,284
Uh, th-there's a problem.

607
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:54,203
I'll be right down!

608
00:54:01,278 --> 00:54:03,846
<i> He was a design freak--</i>
<i>art deco, self-taught.</i>

609
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:05,931
<i>He tried to get Julia Morgan</i>

610
00:54:06,016 --> 00:54:08,100
<i>to come out and build</i>
<i>a place for him,</i>

611
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:10,385
<i>but she demanded that he pay</i>
<i>his workers fair wages,</i>

612
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:12,387
<i>so he told her to stuff it.</i>

613
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,389
There's a part of these plans
that make no sense.

614
00:54:14,442 --> 00:54:17,726
I mean, entire hallways
with no rooms off of them.

615
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:22,781
It looks like you
want us to build,

616
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:25,701
uh, some sort of
secret passage system.

617
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:29,988
Well, of course
these make no sense.

618
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:31,990
These aren't the right ones.

619
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:33,909
You're working off an old draft.

620
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:35,327
Come up to my office with me.

621
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:36,712
I'll get you the new set.

622
00:54:36,747 --> 00:54:38,580
Okay, good.

623
00:54:44,805 --> 00:54:47,005
I envy you.

624
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:52,060
My curse was making
my fortune too early.

625
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:14,916
My point being that the appetites
of the filthy rich are specific.

626
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,770
***

627
00:55:18,088 --> 00:55:19,955
Do you mind?

628
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:25,043
I feed some of that hunger
with this building.

629
00:55:27,798 --> 00:55:30,632
My art.

630
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:34,603
But sometimes, if I really want

631
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:37,389
that good, full feeling...

632
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:57,910
<i>He wasn't just
building the finest hotel.</i>

633
00:55:57,995 --> 00:55:59,211
<i>Los Angeles had ever seen.</i>

634
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:03,931
<i>It was a perfectly designed</i>
<i>torture chamber.</i>

635
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:06,802
<i>An engineered alibi.</i>

636
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:09,421
<i>Secret chutes and rooms</i>

637
00:56:09,506 --> 00:56:11,234
<i>to hide and dispose</i>
<i>of the bodies.</i>

638
00:56:12,476 --> 00:56:15,310
<i>Hallways with no exits.</i>

639
00:56:17,264 --> 00:56:20,599
<i>Walls were lined with asbestos</i>

640
00:56:20,684 --> 00:56:23,068
<i>so they could mute the screams.</i>

641
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:24,519
<i>People walked in,</i>

642
00:56:24,605 --> 00:56:26,772
<i>just vanished.</i>

643
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:28,834
<i>"No body, no crime,"</i>
<i>he would say.</i>

644
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:32,205
No, no.

645
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:34,746
I don't like small spaces.

646
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:35,747
Please.

647
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:38,083
Help!

648
00:56:39,536 --> 00:56:40,702
Somebody help!

649
00:56:40,754 --> 00:56:42,204
Help!

650
00:56:42,256 --> 00:56:43,872
Help! Help!

651
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,791
No.

652
00:56:45,876 --> 00:56:47,509
Please, no.

653
00:56:50,764 --> 00:56:52,214
<i>He had a wife.</i>

654
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:53,682
No.

655
00:56:53,717 --> 00:56:55,517
<i>They say he forced her</i>
<i>to watch the torture.</i>

656
00:56:55,552 --> 00:56:57,269
I like it.

657
00:56:57,354 --> 00:56:58,887
Help. No, please.

658
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:01,139
No, help!

659
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:03,803
<i>No one knows how many died.</i>

660
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:06,278
<i>Rumor has it</i>
<i>he averaged three a week.</i>

661
00:57:06,363 --> 00:57:08,981
<i>A lot more if he went</i>
<i>on a bender.</i>

662
00:57:09,066 --> 00:57:10,816
Help!

663
00:57:38,812 --> 00:57:40,762
Miss Evers!

664
00:57:40,848 --> 00:57:43,148
Yes, Mr. March?

665
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:45,100
Do you require fresh linens?

666
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:46,318
Yes.

667
00:57:46,403 --> 00:57:49,104
But more importantly,

668
00:57:49,156 --> 00:57:50,439
remind me to switch out

669
00:57:50,491 --> 00:57:52,941
this God-awful Secessionist
light fixture.

670
00:57:52,993 --> 00:57:54,493
Makes this place

671
00:57:54,578 --> 00:57:56,411
look like a damn zoo.

672
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,485
Excuse my language.

673
00:58:07,857 --> 00:58:10,191
<i>His loyal minion.</i>

674
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:13,161
<i>Miss Evers, the laundress.</i>

675
00:58:14,781 --> 00:58:18,032
<i>She said she could get a stain</i>
<i>out of anything for Mr. March</i>

676
00:58:18,068 --> 00:58:21,219
<i>using a secret ingredient--</i>

677
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:23,571
<i>love.</i>

678
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:50,743
My father was a true believer.

679
00:58:52,235 --> 00:58:55,403
Ate the little cracker
and drank the wine every Sunday.

680
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:01,039
And he was the meanest
son of a bitch you've ever seen.

681
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:05,330
Kill a cat for purring too loud.

682
00:59:08,118 --> 00:59:11,753
You want me to tell you
the worst thing in this world?

683
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,062
Religion.

684
00:59:15,425 --> 00:59:17,625
That and regulations.

685
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:20,962
God is in my heart so I
know there is always hope.

686
00:59:28,138 --> 00:59:31,111
You think there is hope now?

687
00:59:32,726 --> 00:59:36,060
You think God is
going to protect you

688
00:59:36,146 --> 00:59:38,479
from the head of this hammer?

689
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:43,302
Or the six floors
you're about to fall?

690
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,253
As long as there is a God,

691
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:49,600
men like you can kill thousands,

692
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:52,994
millions,

693
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:54,993
but you will never find peace.

694
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:05,006
Well then,

695
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:07,351
I guess I'm just going
to have to kill God.

696
01:00:09,596 --> 01:00:12,346
That is my message to the world.

697
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:29,664
Fly!

698
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:31,866
I'll fetch you a clean shirt.

699
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,207
And I want every Bible

700
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:42,710
from every bed stand
in this entire hotel!

701
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:07,479
What in the Hell is this mess?

702
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:10,404
No I.D.'s.

703
01:01:16,212 --> 01:01:17,841
Not right

704
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:19,213
for someone

705
01:01:19,249 --> 01:01:21,414
to pull this shit on a Sunday.

706
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:32,454
<i>He was sloppy with his
wet work out in the world.</i>

707
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,847
<i>They say somebody turned him in.</i>

708
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:37,348
<i>No one knows who,</i>

709
01:01:37,433 --> 01:01:40,268
<i>but I'm betting on the wife.</i>

710
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,987
<i>With him gone,</i>
<i>she got everything.</i>

711
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:46,107
<i>All those millions.</i>

712
01:01:55,335 --> 01:01:56,667
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

713
01:01:56,753 --> 01:01:59,120
I have some very bad news.

714
01:01:59,205 --> 01:02:02,795
The police are here.

715
01:02:54,427 --> 01:02:57,395
Oh, Miss Evers.

716
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,898
You have always been
the only one I can count on.

717
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:03,017
You are a pillar.

718
01:03:03,102 --> 01:03:05,353
And so I give you the honors.

719
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:08,522
What order shall we die in?

720
01:03:10,026 --> 01:03:11,859
Oh, Mr. March.

721
01:03:13,863 --> 01:03:15,529
Oh, I really don't know.

722
01:03:15,615 --> 01:03:17,531
I mean, part of me wishes
you would go first

723
01:03:17,584 --> 01:03:19,584
so I could launder the sheets.

724
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:21,202
There's no time for that,
is there?

725
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,590
No.

726
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:28,259
It seems not.

727
01:03:28,344 --> 01:03:30,211
I will go first.

728
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:37,635
Gun, please.

729
01:03:46,896 --> 01:03:48,646
Would you do me the honor

730
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:50,683
of making me your last one?

731
01:03:50,803 --> 01:03:52,533
Your last meal?

732
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,203
Miss Evers.

733
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:42,867
You're in the wrong profession.

734
01:04:42,952 --> 01:04:44,952
You should be writing
for the movies.

735
01:04:45,004 --> 01:04:47,171
Ain't a movie.

736
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:48,956
This place is the real deal.

737
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:51,375
If you want to know
what's really going on here,

738
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:53,961
you're gonna have
to expand your thinking a bit.

739
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:57,098
Well, I've worked
every kind of crime--

740
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:59,517
robbery, homicide, assault.

741
01:04:59,602 --> 01:05:01,135
Not one of them were committed

742
01:05:01,187 --> 01:05:03,471
by a ghoul or a ghost.

743
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:05,973
People do enough damage

744
01:05:06,025 --> 01:05:07,808
without help from the afterlife.

745
01:05:12,231 --> 01:05:14,365
Put it on her tab.

746
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,233
That was his office.

747
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,235
The room you're staying in,

748
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:19,954
64.

749
01:05:19,989 --> 01:05:21,572
If this building has a heart,

750
01:05:21,657 --> 01:05:24,825
it's black as the ace of spades,

751
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:26,792
and you're sleeping in it.

752
01:05:55,269 --> 01:05:57,597
Got the lab results
on that bloody award.

753
01:05:57,717 --> 01:06:00,856
It's what you thought--
DNA matches our first vic.

754
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:03,859
Martin Gamboa, our blogger.

755
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:07,496
Wrote for that site Gold Derby.

756
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:08,947
Now we've got a murder weapon.

757
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:12,117
Yeah, and maybe a motive.

758
01:06:13,504 --> 01:06:15,003
What's this?

759
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,865
You ever hear
of James Patrick March?

760
01:06:18,425 --> 01:06:19,925
Oilman.

761
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:20,916
No.

762
01:06:21,036 --> 01:06:22,844
He made a killing
during the Great Depression.

763
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,763
Built a hotel here.

764
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,364
Might have been a serial killer.

765
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:28,931
Before he topped himself,
police were trying to connect him

766
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,514
to a bunch of unsolved murders.

767
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,186
They couldn't know, but

768
01:06:32,306 --> 01:06:33,282
somebody else did.

769
01:06:33,402 --> 01:06:34,806
What are you talking about?

770
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:37,130
It's a pattern, Andy.

771
01:06:37,566 --> 01:06:38,738
A pattern?
Yeah.

772
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:40,445
Dead thief, cut off his hands.

773
01:06:40,531 --> 01:06:42,131
Thou Shalt Not Steal.

774
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:43,402
Illegals, looking for work

775
01:06:43,522 --> 01:06:44,336
on a Sunday.

776
01:06:44,456 --> 01:06:46,118
Remember the Sabbath
to keep it holy.

777
01:06:46,238 --> 01:06:47,987
Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery.

778
01:06:48,107 --> 01:06:50,489
Thou Shalt Not Worship
False Idols.

779
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:51,623
And the Rylance Twins.

780
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:52,779
Most people thought

781
01:06:52,899 --> 01:06:54,362
their parents' boating
accident was an accident.

782
01:06:54,482 --> 01:06:56,194
But maybe our killer
knew better.

783
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:58,613
Maybe-maybe the rumors
were true--

784
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:01,083
they offed Mommy and Daddy.

785
01:07:01,135 --> 01:07:03,001
Honor Thy Mother And Father.

786
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,441
The Ten Commandments?

787
01:07:08,475 --> 01:07:10,342
You're saying
someone's picked up

788
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:12,556
where this-this
March guy left off?

789
01:07:12,676 --> 01:07:14,763
Maybe.

790
01:07:14,848 --> 01:07:15,931
I don't know, John.

791
01:07:17,351 --> 01:07:18,864
Holy shit.

792
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:20,558
The hotel he built--

793
01:07:20,678 --> 01:07:22,340
that's where you're living now.

794
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:25,907

Who's she?

820
01:09:00,454 --> 01:09:02,447
He looked extra juicy.

821
01:09:04,147 --> 01:09:06,091
And clean.

822
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:07,375
Look, dude,

823
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:09,044
you're hot, but vag action

824
01:09:09,129 --> 01:09:10,428
is a total deal breaker for me.
