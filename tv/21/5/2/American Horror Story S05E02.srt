for second-degree
assault.

178

We figure he couldn't
take the pressure,

179
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,196
so he poisons them all,

180
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:09,039
and blows his brains out.

He didn't.

187
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,050
His power had been turned off,

188
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:46,720
so he brings in
a portable generator

189
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,939
so his kids can stay warm.

190

192

I took the family to the beach.

Well, if you want to know
what this place is about,

674
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:01,367
you have to know
about the man who built it--

675
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:03,807
James Patrick March.

676
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,793
He put atom of evil in his
being into building this hotel.

677
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:13,679
March was a self-made
man-- oil, coal.

678
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:15,598
But he was new money,

679
00:53:15,683 --> 00:53:18,517
shunned by the elites
of East Coast society.

680
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:21,387
So he came west, to a land
where pedigree meant little

681
00:53:21,439 --> 00:53:23,305
if you had a lot of dough.

682
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:26,725
Here he would build a monument
to excess and opulence,

683
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:29,561
where he could satisfy
his own peculiar appetites.

684
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:31,447
Uh, Mr. March?

685
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:33,232
Mr. March?!

686
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:35,484
Uh, th-there's a problem.

687
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:37,403
I'll be right down!

688
00:53:44,478 --> 00:53:47,046
IRIS: He was a design freak--
art deco, self-taught.

689
00:53:47,081 --> 00:53:49,131
He tried to get Julia Morgan

690
00:53:49,216 --> 00:53:51,300
to come out and build
a place for him,

691
00:53:51,385 --> 00:53:53,585
but she demanded that he pay
his workers fair wages,

692
00:53:53,638 --> 00:53:55,587
so he told her to stuff it.

693
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,589
There's a part of these plans
that make no sense.

694
00:53:57,642 --> 00:54:00,926
I mean, entire hallways
with no rooms off of them.

695
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:05,981
It looks like you
want us to build,

696
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:08,901
uh, some sort of
secret passage system.

697
00:54:11,105 --> 00:54:13,188
Well, of course
these make no sense.

698
00:54:13,274 --> 00:54:15,190
These aren't the right ones.

699
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:17,109
You're working off an old draft.

my fortune too early.

(CHOKING)

841
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:25,467
You're in the wrong profession.

842
01:04:25,552 --> 01:04:27,552
You should be writing
for the movies.

843
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:29,771
Ain't a movie.

844
01:04:29,856 --> 01:04:31,556
This place is the real deal.

845
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:33,975
If you want to know
what's really going on here,

846
01:04:34,061 --> 01:04:36,561
you're gonna have
to expand your thinking a bit.

847
01:04:36,647 --> 01:04:39,698
Well, I've worked
every kind of crime--

848
01:04:39,733 --> 01:04:42,117
robbery, homicide, assault.

849
01:04:42,202 --> 01:04:43,735
Not one of them were committed

850
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:46,071
by a ghoul or a ghost.

851
01:04:47,308 --> 01:04:48,573
People do enough damage

852
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,408
without help from the afterlife.

853
01:04:54,831 --> 01:04:56,965
Put it on her tab.

854
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:58,833
That was his office.

855
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:00,835
The room you're staying in,

856
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:02,554
64.

857
01:05:02,589 --> 01:05:04,172
If this building has a heart,

858
01:05:04,257 --> 01:05:07,425
it's black as the ace of spades,

859
01:05:07,477 --> 01:05:09,392
(CHUCKLES)
and you're sleeping in it.

860
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:38,897
HAHN: Got the lab results
on that bloody award.

861
01:05:39,017 --> 01:05:42,156
It's what you thought--
DNA matches our first vic.

862
01:05:42,241 --> 01:05:45,159
Martin Gamboa, our blogger.

863
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:48,796
Wrote for that site Gold Derby.

864
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:50,247
Now we've got a murder weapon.

865
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:53,417
Yeah, and maybe a motive.

866
01:05:54,804 --> 01:05:56,303
What's this?

867
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,165
You ever hear
of James Patrick March?

868
01:05:59,725 --> 01:06:01,225
Oilman.

869
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,216
No.

870
01:06:02,336 --> 01:06:04,144
He made a killing
during the Great Depression.

871
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,063
Built a hotel here.

872
01:06:06,148 --> 01:06:07,664
Might have been a serial killer.

873
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:10,231
Before he topped himself,
police were trying to connect him

874
01:06:10,351 --> 01:06:11,814
to a bunch of unsolved murders.

875
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,486
They couldn't know, but

876
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:14,582
somebody else did.

877
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:16,106
What are you talking about?

878
01:06:16,192 --> 01:06:18,430
It's a pattern, Andy.

879
01:06:18,866 --> 01:06:20,038
A pattern?
Yeah.

880
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:21,745
Dead thief, cut off his hands.

881
01:06:21,831 --> 01:06:23,431
Thou Shalt Not Steal.

882
01:06:23,551 --> 01:06:24,702
Illegals, looking for work

883
01:06:24,822 --> 01:06:25,636
on a Sunday.

884
01:06:25,756 --> 01:06:27,418
Remember the Sabbath
to keep it holy.

885
01:06:27,538 --> 01:06:29,287
Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery.

886
01:06:29,407 --> 01:06:31,789
Thou Shalt Not Worship
False Idols.

887
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:32,923
And the Rylance Twins.

888
01:06:33,008 --> 01:06:34,079
Most people thought

889
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,662
their parents' boating
accident was an accident.

890
01:06:35,782 --> 01:06:37,494
But maybe our killer
knew better.

891
01:06:37,614 --> 01:06:39,913
Maybe-maybe the rumors
were true--

892
01:06:40,033 --> 01:06:42,383
they offed Mommy and Daddy.

893
01:06:42,435 --> 01:06:44,301
Honor Thy Mother And Father.

894
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,741
The Ten Commandments?

895
01:06:49,775 --> 01:06:51,642
You're saying
someone's picked up

896
01:06:51,727 --> 01:06:53,856
where this-this
March guy left off?

897
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:56,063
Maybe.

898
01:06:56,148 --> 01:06:57,231
I don't know, John.

899
01:06:58,651 --> 01:07:00,164
Holy shit.

900
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:01,858
The hotel he built--

901
01:07:01,978 --> 01:07:03,640
that's where you're living now.

902
01:07:05,374 --> 01:07:07,207

Who's she?

929
01:08:41,754 --> 01:08:43,747
He looked extra juicy.

930
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:47,391
And clean.

931

Look, dude,

932
01:08:48,761 --> 01:08:50,344
you're hot, but vag action

933
