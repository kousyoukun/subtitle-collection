1
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,155
You lied.
Mm.

2
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,833
I'm not free.

3
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,164
Well, you got that right, asshole.

4
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,999
It's your own damned fault...

5
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,505
...thinking you could cheat death.

6
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,111
Mm-mm.

7
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,042
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

8
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,057
Help!

9
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,066
Help!

10
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,135
Help!

11
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,139
Help!

12
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,716
Help.

13
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,279
Help.

14
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,978
Can't you shut her up?

15
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,217
I can hear her through the duct.

16
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,586
Did you forget a cop is staying here?

17
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,489
He's away at work.
Help.

18
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,393
She'll stop. She always gives up
in a minute.

19
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:02,757
See?

20
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,629
Yuck. Tastes gross.

21
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,814
That's because she's dead. Stop.

22
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,636
It's a horror.

23
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,976
I'll have to use ammonia
to refresh these linens.

24
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,854
I've always admired the Swedes
and their chocolate.

25
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,787
It's a wonder they stay so thin.

26
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,984
Chocolate's the Swiss.

27
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,453
Get some juice and cookies.

28
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,937
That's the last of it.

29
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,536
Thank you.

30
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,781
Where's Donovan?
Getting dressed, I hope.

31
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,418
It's just been a while since I've seen him.

32
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,922
You're torturing that woman.

33
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,656
I was a junkie because I wanted
to escape from my mother.

34
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,391
You made it so I never can.

35
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,729
Why haven't you changed?

36
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,842
We're going to miss the opening.
We don't have space for any more an.

37
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,155
Besides...

38
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,921
...you don't have the money, babe.

39
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,530
We're not going for the art, dumbass.

40
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,261
We're going for the hunt.

41
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,772
We just fed.

42
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,665
Come on. Let's stay in.

43
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,436
We could binge-watch <i>House</i> of Cards.

44
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,763
<i>Caressing the marble and stone</i>

45
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:40,175
<i>Love that was special for one</i>

46
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,742
<i>The waste and the fever and hate</i>

47
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:51,781
<i>How I wish you were here with me now</i>

48
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,760
You're very brave, Max.

49
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,104
- We're almost done here.
- You think this could be strep?

50
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,638
I looked on WebMD and they say that--
ALEX: Stay off the Internet.

51
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,610
It'll only make your head spin.

52
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,013
Can you breathe in for me, Max?

53
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,315
He sounds terrible, doesn't he?

54
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,224
Hang in there.

55
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,298
We're gonna get you all better. Don't worry.

56
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,333
I'm just gonna talk to your mom
for a minute, okay?

57
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,308
Your son has the measles.

58
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,578
Oh, the measles?

59
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,018
Thank God. I thought
it was something serious.

60
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,158
The measles are serious, Mrs. Ellison.

61
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,315
And completely unnecessary.

62
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,019
If you had followed my advice
and had Max vaccinated--

63
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,324
We did what we thought was right.

64
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,331
All that stuff about how vaccines
can lead to autism...

65
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,994
...how they can actually kill people--
Measles kill people.

66
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,401
Children.

67
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,338
Millions in the developing world,
until pretty recently.

68
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,036
You don't live in the developing world.
You live on the west side of L.A.

69
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,409
Believe me, there are plenty of real threats...

70
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,450
...right outside these doors
for you to be worried about.

71
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,893
Look, our children are at risk
from so much in this world.

72
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,856
We can never protect them from all of it.

73
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,067
But when there's something we can do
to make them just a little bit safer, we do it.

74
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,737
So, what's the treatment?

75
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,239
There isn't one.

76
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:02,077
Tylenol to keep his fever down,
lots of liquids.

77
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,873
And rest.

78
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,708
Something you won't be getting much of
in the next couple weeks, I'm afraid.

79
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,881
Call me if his fever spikes again.

80
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,887
Okay.

81
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,613
Turndown service?

82
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,310
No.
Oh.

83
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,649
Shh. Shh.

84
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,625
<i>Mom swam</i>

85
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,382
Holden.

86
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,152
<i>Mom swam</i>

87
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,986
Holden.

88
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,222
<i>Mom swam</i>

89
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,231
Holden.

90
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,900
Holden.

91
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,569
Holden.

92
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,336
Holden.

93
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,353
Holden.

94
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,443
Are you looking for someone?

95
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,277
I guess not.

96
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,315
This place is bat-shit crazy, you know.

97
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,956
Weird things go down, especially at night.

98
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,123
You look like you could use a drink.

99
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,129
Oh.

100
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,994
I know that look.

101
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:21,366
Hanging on to your sobriety
like it's the last train out of Dodge.

102
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,309
Bring him a ginger ale, Cleopatra.

103
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,240
The hour between 2 and 3:00 a.m.
is always the worst.

104
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,892
So I take it you live here?

105
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,551
I do.

106
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,221
How long?

107
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,729
Too long.

108
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,230
And I'm not a hooker...

109
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,736
...if that's what you're wondering.

110
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,565
I wasn't.

111
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,045
I can't help but wonder how some“?
How come a girl like me...

112
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,182
...ends up with tracks in her arms
living in this dump?

113
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,716
That's one way to put it.

114
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:17,291
Patti Smith said that my poems
were like glass shattering.

115
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,695
I wrote a song with her.

116
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,094
And then she wrote me off.

117
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,364
Why?

118
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,369
Because of the smack?

119
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,876
Getting high used to be like
how you imagine heaven.

120
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,976
Pure light.

121
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,049
Perfection of it all.

122
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,787
Even in me.

123
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,653
Then I got lost.

124
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,557
Kept trying to climb higher.

125
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,763
Get closer to that light.

126
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:05,272
Like an endless ladder where all you do
is get further and further away.

127
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,244
There's a part of you
that wants to get lost, am I right?

128
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,814
Climb that ladder.

129
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:35,338
Tell me about your very last drunk.

130
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,940
What kind of day was it?

131
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,714
I like details.

132
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,661
Started like most days.

133
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,799
<i>Multiple-homicide day in Glassell Park.</i>

134
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,062
Dad here spent the year in prison
for second-degree assault.

135
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,875
We figure he couldn't take the pressure,
so he poisons them all...

136
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,534
...and blows his brains out.

137
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,448
Well, at least they died peacefully.

138
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,274
Broccoli.

139
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,242
Somebody cared.

140
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:28,116
What happens to a man,
makes him murder his own kids?

141
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,155
He didn't.

142
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:50,738
<i>His power had been turned off,
so he brings in a <i>portable generator...</i>

143
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,306
<i>...so his kids can stay warm.</i>

144
00:18:58,738 --> 00:18:59,910
<i>Must have run nut of gas.</i>

145
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,444
<i>Comes back from his night shift...</i>

146
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:09,594
<i>"finds his whole family dead
from carbon monoxide poisoning.</i>

147
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,322
<i>That's enough to make</i> a <i>man shoot himself.</i>

148
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,168
I had two kids at the time.

149
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,099
Holden...

150
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,295
...and Scarlett.

151
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,272
I didn't make it back home for two days.

152
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,712
Then the day I came home,
I took the family to the beach.

153
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,482
Some kind of...

154
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,115
...desperate gesture
to earn my wife's forgiveness.

155
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,191
It almost worked.

156
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,661
Holden.

157
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,564
But my son...

158
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,128
...Holden...

159
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,203
...l lost him.

160
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,684
I can't afford to get lost.

161
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,668
So you were right about our Bel-Air via.

162
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,868
He was pumped full of male potency drugs.

163
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,410
Near lethal dose.

164
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,278
They still have him in the induced coma.
Something interesting though.

165
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,716
Both victims had the same text on their phone.
Each asking the other to meet at the Bel-Air.

166
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:47,722
Only they didn't send them to each other.
A third party spoofed their numbers?

167
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,121
Our killer has some tech savvy.

168
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,860
That's your mom. We have to go.

169
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,630
- John, you have a package.
- A package?

170
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,799
Hotel Cortez. That's where
you're staying, right?

171
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,775
Let's evacuate the building.

172
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,477
Get the bomb squad down here!

173
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,937
Okay.

174
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:44,411
It's not a bomb. I mean, we can take it outside
and detonate it if you want to be safe...

175
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,073
...but you might want to take a look first.

176
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,082
Thanks, Ted.
Yeah.

177
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,823
Congratulations.

178
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,603
Let's run this down to the crime lab.
Everything.

179
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,606
Let's run this blood too,
and see if it matches any of our victims.

180
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,058
Claudia, you made it.

181
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,356
Will, this place, it's marvelous.

182
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,625
It's like some sad whore
that stayed too long at the party.

183
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:42,171
I know. I still can't decide if I should renovate it
or just let it decay around me.

184
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:46,037
A lot of these fixtures are original, you know.
Mm.

185
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,677
Can I help you with something?

186
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,076
Just teaching the folks from Vogue
how to vogue. I couldn't resist.

187
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,841
The irony.

188
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,912
Skinny jeans are out, fringe is in,
and ponchos are forever.

189
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,885
Make a note of it.

190
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,356
You will spend the night?
Are you kidding me'? I'm spending the week.

191
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,394
I'll write about fashion,
and I'll sleep with history.

192
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,897
Tell me.

193
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,897
Does he come with the building?

194
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,263
He's one of our residents.

195
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,901
Hi there. Room 64, policeman, right?

196
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,167
Yeah.

197
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,537
Will Drake, new owner.

198
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,871
Right.

199
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,843
<i>Claudia Bankson, Vague Magazine.</i>

200
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,679
Didn't mean to crash.
I'm looking for my daughter.

201
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,343
- She was supposed to be dropped off here.
- Daddy.

202
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:34,881
Dad, guess what.

203
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,254
Officer Pettibone let me run the siren.

204
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,453
Oh, Officer Pettibone knows better.

205
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,029
She hi! a triple at recess.

206
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,257
Oh, that's my girl.

207
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,901
All right, thanks, Carl.
Sure.

208
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,765
Let's go.
Wow, you live here?

209
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,271
It doesn't always look like this.
ls it a party?

210
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,431
It is, and you and your father are invited.

211
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,600
Thanks, but we have
our whole day planned.

212
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,373
Dad.
Honey, this is a grownup party.

213
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,641
No, it's... She can sit with my son, Lachlan.

214
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,547
Lachlan, this is Scarlett.
I'll take care of tickets.

215
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,915
Come on, man. I need to be on this list.

216
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,648
Sorry, is there a problem here?
I'm not on the list.

217
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,726
I'm not sure who you are. Right.
I goddamn live here.

218
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,597
This is a private affair, dear.

219
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,823
The event's full. Maybe next time.

220
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,631
Come on, man.

221
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,294
This is my house. This is my house!

222
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,269
Get off of me!

223
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,953
This is my first fashion show.

224
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,420
My millionth.

225
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,958
Maybe later I'll show you
something really cool.

226
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:14,649
<i>Mama says
The truth is all that matters</i>

227
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,493
<i>Lying and deceiving is</i> a <i>sin</i>

228
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,325
There's that cop that moved into 64.

229
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,031
The police don't worry me.

230
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,799
He's very handsome.

231
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,875
You do have a type.

232
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:38,573
I'm afraid we're not much company
compared to what you're used to.

233
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,343
Oh, please. We're all so bored of each other.

234
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,256
We need some excitement,
and we just might get it.

235
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,393
Will booked Tristan Duffy for the runway.

236
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,060
And with him, you can always
expect something quite unorthodox.

237
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,599
Tristan.

238
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,168
What?

239
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,434
Whatever.

240
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,075
Let's just do this.

241
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,203
<i>Living for the moment</i>

242
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,510
<i>Lips and lashes</i>

243
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:22,056
<i>Will I ever find my way again?</i>

244
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:29,022
<i>Don 't stop
Don't stop the dance</i>

245
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,532
<i>No more music</i>

246
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,434
<i>Don't stop the dance</i>

247
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:09,964
<i>Don't stop</i>

248
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,099
<i>Don't stop the dance</i>

249
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:42,098
<i>Footsteps in the dark</i>

250
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,002
<i>Come together</i>

251
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,206
<i>Gotta keep on movin'</i>

252
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,147
<i>Or H] die</i>

253
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,007
<i>Don't stop</i>

254
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,777
What was that about?

255
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,659
He's full of rage.

256
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,192
L can still smell it.

257
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,889
Like copper.

258
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,971
You need to get your shit together.

259
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,972
The show is not over.

260
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,234
It is for me.

261
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,082
I'm done with modeling.

262
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,059
You can't tell anyone about this.

263
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,994
It has to be our secret.

264
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,758
I mean it.

265
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,679
Come on, don't be a wuss.

266
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,402
Nothing wakes them up.

267
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,243
Watch .

268
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,606
What do you think you're doing?

269
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,714
I know there's coke in here.

270
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,008
I can smell it.

271
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,616
Stop, before you make me stop you.

272
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,619
Call the cops, man. I don't give a shit.

273
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,357
I'm coming out in a Lars von Trier movie
next year.

274
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,306
I made a rule to stay away from junkies...

275
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,845
...but I'm gonna make an exception
with you.

276
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,691
Let him go.

277
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,836
Mm.

278
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:54,750
Let me assert my firm belief...

279
00:32:54,906 --> 00:33:01,755
<i>“that the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.</i>

280
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,276
Shit!

281
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,220
Take any piece you like.

282
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,895
None of it has any meaning for me.

283
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,932
You look like you need a drink.

284
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:24,900
I'm good.

285
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,375
Oh.

286
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,245
Bolivian marching powder.

287
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,609
Too tame for my taste.

288
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:40,018
I've found a far better way to stimulate.

289
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:44,225
I've tried it all, man. There is nothing better.

290
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,089
You know.

291
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,430
In your black heart of hearts, you know.

292
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,927
You're just like me.

293
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,803
I don't think so, dude.

294
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,775
Well, I had it all once.

295
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,139
Fortune, fame.

296
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,611
But nothing satisfied.

297
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,048
"To thine own self be true."

298
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,282
Polonius.

299
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,827
I'll show you what you've been dreaming of.

300
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:31,935
Yes, sir?

301
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,745
Stop your sniveling.
I found this one in the bar, sir.

302
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,847
Prostituting herself.
Ah.

303
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,450
There's nothing she won't do for a dollar.

304
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,177
Oh, sorry, man, bondage really bores me.

305
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,614
Me too.

306
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,952
Pull the trigger and take her last breath.

307
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,490
It's exhilarating.
You're crazy.

308
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,599
Get off me, man.

309
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,043
Well.
No.

310
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,649
You got to go out and grab life.

311
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,343
Oh! Jesus!

312
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,883
Laundress?
Yes, sir?

313
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,150
Replace the linens.
Right away, sir.

314
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,656
I'll get the ammonia.

315
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,658
What a glorious stain.

316
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,579
What took you so long?

317
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,513
You know who I am?

318
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,446
Scarlett.

319
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,966
Do you remember them?

320
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,869
That's Mom...

321
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,036
...Dad, and that's me, and that's you.

322
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,308
But you're different now.

323
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,808
I grew up.

324
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,851
Why haven't you?

325
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,793
Mom and Dad are gonna be so happy
when they see you.

326
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,794
They think you're dead.

327
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,701
Let's go home now.

328
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,704
I am home.

329
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,362
I like it here.

330
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,640
You can come to visit whenever you want.

331
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,982
Can I take a picture?

332
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,654
Okay, here we go.

333
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,104
Aw.

334
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,926
Kids are the best.

335
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:05,636
If you could just ask Wendy
if she could think of anything...

336
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,744
...anything she might have said
or if she saw her with someone.

337
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,313
Why can't I patch into the cameras
downtown from my laptop here at home?

338
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,917
She's been gone for hours. It's a longtime
when a psycho has your number.

339
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,610
Daddy?

340
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,823
Oh, my God.

341
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,159
Where have you been?

342
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,696
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

343
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:33,961
Did somebody take you?

344
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,765
I went on a bus. To your hotel.

345
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,703
Alone?

346
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,103
Yes.

347
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,299
Jesus Christ, Scarlett.

348
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,776
Jesus Christ, you can't do that to us.

349
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,346
I'm sorry, Mommy.

350
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,982
How did this happen?
Mom...

351
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:51,314
...l pretended to go to the bathroom
and then climbed out the window.

352
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,457
I know the police guy couldn't go in there.

353
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,121
I wanted to see if it was really him.

354
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,692
I wanted to surprise you.

355
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,625
What are you talking about?

356
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:03,163
You wanted to see who, Scan'?

357
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,562
Holden. He's at your hotel.

358
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,305
Holden is dead, Scarlett.

359
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:17,145
No. I saw him. I was just talking with him.

360
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,837
No, you weren't!

361
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,883
He's dead, and he's never coming back,
all right? So stop saying that.

362
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,345
I'm not a liar. Look, Hook a picture.

363
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,992
I saw him, and he was real,
and you lied to me.

364
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:33,152
No.
You said he was dead, but I saw him.

365
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,164
Jesus Christ, I cant believe you
made me go through this again.

366
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,400
You think Holden was my fault?

367
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,344
I'm sorry, I'm very tired.

368
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,176
I'm going to bed.

369
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:17,867
<i>Jesus Christ. I look amazing.</i>

370
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,440
I would do me.

371
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:27,812
No zits, no blackheads. Mm.

372
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,083
All that crystal was wrecking my skin...

373
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,447
...making me look like something
on that website, Faces of Math.

374
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,420
Now I look, what, like 24.

375
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,758
Goddamn.
Ha-ha-ha.

376
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,601
The beauty of the virus is you never age.

377
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:50,432
You now have a supercharged
immune system.

378
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,068
Can a bullet take me out'?

379
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,141
A silver bullet or a stake?

380
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,335
Bitch, please, of course it can.

381
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:02,276
You're only immortal if you're smart.

382
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:25,932
No fangs?

383
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:27,669
We don't bite.

384
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,867
We cut.

385
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,637
Harder, harder.

386
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,803
Harder. Tristan.

387
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:37,309
Aah!

388
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,952
Never drink from the dead.

389
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:45,458
Avoid the diseased, the feeble, the polluted.

390
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,994
Bad blood is like a...

391
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,632
A bad flu or worse.

392
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,495
Coffins?

393
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:55,695
I prefer blackout curtains
and a Duxiana bed.

394
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,871
The sun won't kill you...

395
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,169
...but it should be avoided.

396
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,813
It will sap your vitality.

397
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:12,377
What?

398
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,750
Nothing, you just remind me so much
of someone.

399
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,160
You know what I can't wait for?

400
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,391
To hunt Kendall Jenner.

401
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,660
Bitch blew me off once at Coachella.

402
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,826
Can I kill her?

403
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:31,906
The only thing that can undo you now...

404
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,202
...is your own recklessness.

405
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,671
Just don't get caught.

406
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:42,207
And don't fall in love.

407
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,684
That's the part you save for me.

408
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,792
Forever.

409
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,966
How old are you?

410
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:02,093
I was born in 1904.

411
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:05,700
Who turned you?

412
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:10,369
One who is even more beautiful than you.

413
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,708
But he's long gone now.

414
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,642
So you'll have to do.

415
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:25,155
Shit. So you lived through, like,
the wars and the depression and...

416
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,927
...Clinton and everything.

417
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,059
What was your favorite time?

418
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:37,394
Every decade has its decadence period.

419
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,341
That's when I'm most alive.

420
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:45,640
I loved the late 1970s the most.

421
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:52,682
<i>I want your love</i>

422
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,188
<i>I want your love</i>

423
00:46:57,615 --> 00:47:01,028
<i>I want your love</i>

424
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,195
<i>I was the disco queen.</i>

425
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,629
<i>I want your love</i>

426
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,296
<i>I want your love</i>

427
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:10,697
<i>I still am.</i>

428
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,334
The darkness was the fight.

429
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:20,938
<i>I could walk amongst them with no fear,
no judgment.</i>

430
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,676
<i>We were all vampires then.</i>

431
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:29,017
<i>Oh, my God, to go back.</i>

432
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,117
<i>I need your love</i>

433
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,686
<i>Just like the birds</i>

434
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,330
<i>in sky above</i>

435
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,660
I mourn it still.

436
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,530
I think about everything
that could have been...

437
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,336
...had they all lived, my friends.

438
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:54,241
Andy, Keith.

439
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,649
Robert.

440
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:03,889
All that loss.

441
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,221
Were those guys you killed?

442
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,392
He won't last a week.

443
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,399
You want to say that to my face?

444
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,504
L just did.

445
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,503
Tristan, would you give us a minute?

446
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,512
Yeah, sure.

447
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,934
I can't believe you turned him.

448
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,980
He's a stupid trashy model.

449
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:04,415
And you were a pathetic addict
dying on a filthy floor.

450
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,285
I didn't wanna hurt you.

451
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,826
I still don't.

452
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,734
There's no reason this has to end badly.

453
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,093
End?

454
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,637
Are you throwing me out?

455
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,608
I love you.

456
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,492
I love you.

457
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,820
And I love you.

458
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,931
But you will learn...

459
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:53,796
...it isn't our precious virus that makes you.

460
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:59,798
It isn't who you kill or who you screw.

461
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,136
Ifs the heartbreaks.

462
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:07,271
Bigger, the better.

463
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:15,519
I know better than any of us.

464
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,854
I'll let you pack your things.

465
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,974
You said when you brought me back
from the brink of death...

466
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,580
...that it was the closest thing you ever had
to a spiritual experience.

467
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,716
You tell me you felt that
when you made him.

468
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,908
Honestly...

469
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:45,343
<i>"it was...</i>

470
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,521
"one of the most...

471
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,419
<i>...erotic...</i>

472
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,423
<i>“moments...</i>

473
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,721
“.01” my fife.

474
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,396
Hey there, handsome. Rough day?

475
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,535
Oh, cowboy,
we don't allow guests back here.

476
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,261
Don't think of me as a guest.

477
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,771
Think of me <i>as</i> the angry father
whose daughter you let roam these halls.

478
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,409
There's nothing in this place
you don't know about...

479
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,943
...which makes you an accessory.
To what?

480
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,944
Murder, maybe kidnapping.

481
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,912
I'm done playing.

482
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:49,642
Aren't you gonna frisk me first?

483
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,048
Oh.

484
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:55,383
It's been a long time since a man
spun me around like that.

485
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:58,049
If I was a few years younger,
I'd even enjoy the cuffs.

486
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,717
You're not gonna enjoy this...

487
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:04,229
...believe me, until you start telling me
everything that's going on in this place.

488
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,596
You've seen things.

489
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,170
You know I have.

490
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,103
Look, before you have to explain
to somebody...

491
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,470
...what you think you're charging me with...

492
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:19,581
...why don't you take these bracelets off of me?
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

493
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,020
Mm.

494
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:35,319
There's just one thing you got to do.
What?

495
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,022
Ask nice.

496
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:40,099
And buy a lady a drink.

497
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:04,554
Is that your thing?
You need to be talked into drinking?

498
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,363
Cut the crap,
ask me what you really wanna know.

499
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,131
I wanna know what's going an
in this place.

500
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:23,474
Well, if you want to know
what this place is about...

501
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:26,308
...you have to know
about the man who built it.

502
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,973
James Patrick March.

503
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,312
<i>He put every atom of evil in his being
into building this hotel.</i>

504
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:38,392
<i>March was</i> a <i>self-made man. Oil, coal.</i>

505
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:42,656
<i>But he was new money,
shunned by the elites of East Coast society.</i>

506
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:47,667
<i>So he came west, to</i> a <i>land where pedigree
meant little if you had</i> a <i>lot of dough.</i>

507
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:50,999
<i>Here he would build</i> a <i>monument
to excess and opulence...</i>

508
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:54,165
<i>...where he could satisfy
his own peculiar appetites.</i>

509
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,571
Mr. March?

510
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,542
Mr. March?

511
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,874
Uh, there-- There's a problem.

512
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,345
I'll be right down.

513
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,385
<i>He was</i> a <i>design freak. Art deco, self-taught.</i>

514
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:15,519
<i>He tried £0 get Julia Morgan to some out
and build</i> a place <i>for him...</i>

515
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:19,532
<i>...but she demanded he pay his workers
fair wages, so he told her to stuff it.</i>

516
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,931
There's a part of these plans
that make no sense.

517
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:26,063
I mean, entire hallways
with no rooms off of them.

518
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,305
It looks like you want us to build...

519
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,414
...some sort of secret passage system.

520
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,541
Well, of course these make no sense.

521
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,585
These aren't the right ones.

522
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,416
You're working off an old draft.

523
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,115
Come up to my office with me.
I'll get you the new set.

524
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,624
Okay, good.

525
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,729
I envy you.

526
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:00,600
My curse was making my fortune too early.

527
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:22,626
My point being that the appetites
of the filthy rich are specific.

528
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,630
Altered from that of the common man.

529
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,462
Do you mind?

530
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,633
I feed some of that hunger
with this building.

531
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,141
My art.

532
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:45,117
But sometimes,
if I really want that good, full feeling...

533
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:07,806
<i>He wasn't just building the finest hotel
Los Angeles had ever seen.</i>

534
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:11,541
<i>It was</i> a <i>perfectly designed torture chamber.</i>

535
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,311
<i>An engineered alibi.</i>

536
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:19,820
<i>Secret chutes and rooms to hide
and dispose of the bodies.</i>

537
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:23,151
<i>Hallways with no exits.</i>

538
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:29,764
<i>Walls were lined with asbestos
so they could mute the screams.</i>

539
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,990
Help me. Help me.

540
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,158
<i>People walked in, just vanished.</i>

541
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,498
<i>"No body, no crime," he would say.</i>

542
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:39,231
No, no.

543
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,378
L don't like small spaces. Please.

544
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:46,839
Help.

545
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,415
Somebody help.

546
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,451
Help!

547
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:52,780
Help.

548
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:55,184
No, please, no.

549
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,784
<i>He had a wife.</i>

550
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,122
No.

551
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:04,892
<i>They say he forced her to watch the torture.
Hike 'n.</i>

552
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,228
Help. No, please.

553
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,029
Oh.
No, help.

554
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,433
<i>Somebody help.
No one knows how many died.</i>

555
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,939
<i>Rumor has ii he averaged three a week,.</i>

556
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,600
<i>A Sat more if he went on a bender.</i>

557
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,371
Help!

558
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,307
Miss Eve rs.

559
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,968
Yes, Mr. March?

560
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,136
Do you require fresh linens?

561
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,976
Yes.

562
00:57:55,405 --> 00:58:00,514
But more importantly, remind me to switch out
this God-awful secessionist light fixture.

563
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:04,316
Makes this place look like a damn zoo.

564
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,091
Excuse my language.

565
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,100
<i>His loyal minion.</i>

566
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,605
<i>Miss Enters, the laundress.</i>

567
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:26,114
<i>She said she could get</i> a <i>stain
out of anything for Mr. March...</i>

568
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,806
<i>...using a secret ingredient.</i>

569
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,943
<i>Love,.</i>

570
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:35,682
Ugh!

571
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,374
My father was a true believer.

572
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:03,482
Ate the little cracker
and drank the wine every Sunday.

573
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:08,985
And he was the meanest son of a bitch
you've ever seen.

574
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:12,320
Kill a cat for purring too loud.

575
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,764
You want me to tell you
the worst thing in this world?

576
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:21,769
Religion.

577
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:25,169
That and regulations.

578
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:29,174
God is in my heart
so I know there is always hope.

579
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:38,349
You think there is hope now?

580
00:59:40,544 --> 00:59:46,358
You think God is going to protect you
from the head of this hammer?

581
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,691
Or the six floors you're about to fall?

582
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:53,425
As long as there is a God...

583
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:57,097
...men like you can kill thousands...

584
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:03,039
...millions, but you will never find peace.

585
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,541
Well then...

586
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:15,082
...l guess I'm just going to have to kill God.

587
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,223
That is my message to the world.

588
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,973
I'll fetch you a clean shirt.

589
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:49,847
And I want every Bible
from every bed stand in this entire hotel!

590
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:15,513
What in the hell is this mess?

591
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,379
No IDs.

592
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,125
Not right for someone
to pull this shit on a Sunday.

593
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:40,168
<i>He was sloppy
with his wet work out in the world.</i>

594
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:46,846
<i>They say somebody turned him in.
No one knows who, but I'm betting on the wife.</i>

595
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,915
<i>With him gone, she got everything.</i>

596
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:53,154
<i>All those millions.</i>

597
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:07,029
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
I have some very bad news.

598
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,602
The police are here.

599
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,419
Oh, Miss Evers.

600
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,953
You have always been
the only one I can count on.

601
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,995
You are a pillar.

602
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,457
And so I give you the honors.

603
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,464
What order shall we die in'?

604
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,732
Oh, Mr. March.

605
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,639
Oh, I really don't know.

606
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,645
I mean, part of me wishes you would go first
so I could launder the sheets.

607
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,510
There's no time for that, is there?

608
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,745
No.

609
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,253
It seems not.

610
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,083
I will go first.

611
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:44,764
Gun, please.

612
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,944
Would you do me the honor
of making me your last one?

613
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,503
Your last meal?

614
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,310
Miss Eve rs.

615
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:51,931
You're in the wrong profession.
You should be writing for the movies.

616
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,167
Ain't a movie.

617
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:55,860
This place is the real deal.

618
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,767
If you wanna know
what's really going on here...

619
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,772
...you're gonna have to expand
your thinking a bit.

620
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,104
Well, I've worked every kind of crime.

621
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,406
Robbery, homicide, assault.

622
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:11,177
Not one of them were committed
by a ghoul or a ghost.

623
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,955
People do enough damage
without help from the afterlife.

624
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,362
Put it on her tab.

625
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,395
That was his office.

626
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:27,023
The room you're staying in, 64.

627
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:31,400
If this building has a heart,
it's black as the ace of spades...

628
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:33,238
...and you're sleeping in it.

629
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,466
Got the lab results on that bloody award.

630
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,940
It's what you thought.
DNA matches our first vie.

631
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,670
Martin Gamboa, art blogger.

632
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:15,817
Wrote for that site Gold Derby.

633
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:18,079
Now we've got a murder weapon.

634
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,744
Yeah, and maybe a motive.

635
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,418
What's this?

636
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:28,358
You ever hear of James Patrick March?
Oilman.

637
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,088
No.

638
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:33,291
He made a killing during the Great Depression.
Built a hotel here.

639
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:36,335
Might have been a serial killer.
Before he topped himself...

640
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,838
...the police were trying to connect him
to a bunch of unsolved murders.

641
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,203
They couldn't do it,
but I think somebody did.

642
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:46,279
What are you talking about?
It's a pattern, Andy.

643
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:47,809
A pattern?
Yeah.

644
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:50,975
Dead thief, cut off his hands.
Thou shalt not steal.

645
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,883
Illegals looking for work on a Sunday.
Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy.

646
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,717
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

647
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,191
Thou shalt not worship false idols.
And the Rylance twins.

648
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,297
People thought their parents' boating accident
was an accident.

649
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,956
But maybe our killer knew better. Maybe...

650
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,865
Maybe the rumors were true,
they offed Mommy and Daddy.

651
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,402
Honor thy father and mother.

652
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,699
The Ten Commandments?

653
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,405
You're saying someone's picked up
where this March guy left off?

654
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:23,073
Maybe.

655
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,853
I don't know, John.

656
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:27,814
Holy shit.

657
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:31,891
The hotel he built,
that's where you're living now.

658
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,154
Yes.

659
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:50,606
<i>From the cradle bars
Comes a beckoning voice</i>

660
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:52,371
<i>R sends you spinning</i>

661
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,776
<i>You have no choice</i>

662
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:18,864
<i>You hear laughter</i>

663
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,872
<i>Cracking through the walls
I! sends you spinning</i>

664
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,271
<i>You have no choice</i>

665
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,140
<i>You hear laughter</i>

666
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:28,282
<i>Cracking through the walls
I! sends you spinning</i>

667
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,042
<i>You have no choice</i>

668
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,880
<i>Following the footsteps
Of</i> a <i>rag doll dance</i>

669
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,112
<i>We are enhanced</i>

670
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,550
<i>Spellbound</i>

671
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:39,557
<i>Following the footsteps
Of</i> a <i>rag doll dance</i>

672
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,218
<i>We are enhanced</i>

673
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:44,797
<i>Spellbound, Spellbound</i>

674
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,627
<i>Spellbound</i>

675
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:54,304
<i>Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound</i>

676
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,307
<i>Spellbound</i>

677
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:06,415
You chose well.

678
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,518
Who's she?

679
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,159
He looked extra juicy.

680
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,490
And clean.

681
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,929
Heh. Look, dude, you're hot,
but vag action is a total deal breaker for me.

682
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,431
I've got rules.

683
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,370
<i>When you think your toys have gone berserk
It's an illusion</i>

684
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,041
<i>You cannot shirk</i>

685
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,114
<i>You hear laughter</i>

686
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:39,219
<i>Cracking through the walls
I! sends you spinning</i>

687
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,615
<i>You have no choice</i>

688
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:44,224
Just because I'm sucking on a dude
doesn't mean I'm gay.

689
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,121
Do you want some?

690
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,556
I'd rather watch.

691
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:51,688
<i>Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound</i>

692
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,234
<i>Spellbound</i>

693
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,851
I need more.

694
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:17,185
Of a rag don' dance
We are entranced

695
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:22,755
<i>Following the footsteps
Of</i> a <i>rag doll dance</i>

696
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,523
<i>We are entranced
Entranced, entranced</i>

697
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,995
<i>Entranced, entranced
Entranced</i>
