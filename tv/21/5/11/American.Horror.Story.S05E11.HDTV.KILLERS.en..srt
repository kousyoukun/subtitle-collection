1
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,420
She's back.

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,859
She just came through the lobby.

3
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:17,174
She... she seems upset
about something.

4
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:19,877
Distracted.
Then now is the perfect time.

5
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:24,448
Are you ready for this, girl?

6
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:27,451
All right, then.

7
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:32,422
We go in, guns blazing.

8
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:33,949
And don't stop.

9
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:35,626
And once she goes down...

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,894
Oh, God.

11
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:39,897
...we need to make sure
she stays down.

12
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:41,898
Okay.

13
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:11,594
* It took seconds of your time
to take his life *

14
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:13,296
* It took seconds

15
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,166
* For a second...

16
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:20,436
Stop.

17
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:23,639
* For a second...

18
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,776
Goddamn it. Donnie,

19
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,011
what'd you have to
go and do that for?

20
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,112
You murdered me.

21
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:32,113
No, baby, no!

22
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:33,281
We were aiming for her.

23
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,482
Iris, we need to find her.

24
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:35,950
We need to finish her!

25
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:38,119
I am not leaving my son.

26
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:40,522
Oh, you can't let me
die in this place.

27
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,791
You are not gonna die.
I won't let you.

28
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,419
It's too late.
Please.

29
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,127
You gotta get me out of here.

30
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:47,497
You can't leave me.

31
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:50,131
I can't be trapped here
with her other lovers.

32
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,966
Okay.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,536
All right.
Let's go.

34
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,370
Aah! Oh.

35
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,220
Okay.

36
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:23,629
What are looking at?
Keep moving!

37
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,341
Am I... am-am I safe?

38
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,677
Yes, baby, yes.
Yes, baby, you're safe.

39
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,012
You're safe.

40
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:41,047
Hey. Thank you...

41
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:46,253
Mom.

42
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:52,591
No.

43
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:11,188
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

44
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,980
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

45
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,313
Shh... Hey, hey!

46
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,547
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

47
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,417
Shh.

48
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,981
Hold tight.

49
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,227
There's still another
half bullet in there.

50
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:41,895
No.

51
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:43,763
Hey.

52
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:45,265
Shh, shh!

53
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:09,423
You saved me.

54
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:11,425
Why?

55
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,161
Because I need you.

56
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,330
Because, for once,

57
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,365
I won't be left.

58
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,272
The bullet nicked
your femoral artery.

59
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,807
You lost a lot of blood.

60
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,944
I know every vein

61
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:33,279
and artery in the human body.

62
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:35,481
You're certainly

63
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:37,783
Edward Sexton
with that needle and thread.

64
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:40,653
They don't call me
Hypodermic Sally for nothing.

65
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:49,022
You're not
going to leave me, right?

66
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,561
They always leave.

67
00:05:57,932 --> 00:06:01,901
Promise me you won't leave me.

68
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:05,939
I'm not going anywhere.

69
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,280
Good.

70
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,955
This kid I grew up with,

71
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:25,792
Juan Moacanda.

72
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:28,528
I gave him his first hand job.

73
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:31,330
We were from the Valley.

74
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,032
Anyway, he went on

75
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,702
to become
this giant drug dealer.

76
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:38,439
His stuff was the shit.

77
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:41,140
I used to sell it for him.

78
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:44,843
Made a lot of
good friends, you know?

79
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:48,314
It was always,
"I'm hurting, Sally."

80
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:51,650
"Can you hook me up, Sally?"

81
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:54,234
Except for Nick Harley

82
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:56,522
and Tina Black.

83
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:59,791
The musicians?

84
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:01,793
I saw them once.

85
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:03,362
At the Troubadour.

86
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,331
They were almost good.

87
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:06,965
Hey!

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,001
They <i>were</i> good.

89
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,005
They were good to me.

90
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:17,143
<i>Same pickup point.</i>

91
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,424
- Yeah, okay.
<i>- They liked my songs.</i>

92
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:20,978
Still rolling.

93
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,813
<i>- They thought I had talent.
- Two, three,</i>

94
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:24,482
four...

95
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,151
* Has anybody seen

96
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,520
* My buddy Pain...

97
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:32,685
* You went out

98
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:34,859
* For a pack of Pall Malls...

99
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,197
* My buddy Pain...

100
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,900
You want me to cut that out

101
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:45,270
and keep going or should
we start from the top?

102
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:48,540
I don't know.
What do you think, Sally?

103
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:51,109
I mean, it's your song, right?

104
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,446
It's hot.

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,280
I think you should leave it.

106
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,482
Sally, you damn pervert.

107
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,250
I love you!

108
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,188
You holding?

109
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:05,722
Always.

110
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:06,923
Well, then we're done here.

111
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,725
Let's get a room

112
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,727
and melt our faces away.

113
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:14,064
<i>They treated me like an artist.</i>

114
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,366
Oh, your grandest suite

115
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,536
for me and my two nieces,
please.

116
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:22,372
All the rooms are
basically the same.

117
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,774
And I'm gonna need a deposit.

118
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,211
What the shit, lady...
based on the way we look?

119
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:29,045
Has there ever been
a more aptly named

120
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,215
style of music than grunge?

121
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:34,584
Man, this is what
rock and roll looks like now.

122
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:35,919
It's not hair spray

123
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:37,954
and spandex anymore.

124
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:41,157
Just put a towel down on
anything if you sit on it naked.

125
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:44,127
Poets' skid marks stain
as much as us commoners.

126
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,967
And for the record,

127
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:55,639
<i>Shout at the Devil</i> was
an underrated masterpiece.

128
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,708
Oh, come on.
Yes.

129
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:12,420
Come on. I hear it feels
like a constant orgasm.

130
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:14,256
Oh, it's gonna hurt like hell.

131
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,424
Perfect.

132
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,260
I'll write a song about it.

133
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:19,995
Pull it out, I want to see.

134
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,464
It'll be easy.

135
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:25,134
I call it the Big Veiny,
for obvious reasons.

136
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,436
* You know what to do about

137
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:29,638
* When you can't

138
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,438
* Seem to do anything about it

139
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:35,109
* Just go, go

140
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:36,277
* Go

141
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,812
* Go...

142
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,346
Nick...

143
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:42,216
I just want to crawl inside
your skins and masturbate.

144
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,821
Got to stay close, man.

145
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:48,389
Thick as thieves.
That's how you get

146
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,658
a number-one record...
you make it real.

147
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:53,161
I know how we can get close.

148
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,361
Make it real.

149
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,863
Do you trust me?

150
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:58,899
* Go, go...

151
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,369
I don't know
why the idea came to me.

152
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:04,505
I just...

153
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:09,042
I wanted us to be so close.

154
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,582
I just loved them so much.

155
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,886
Tell me you love me.

156
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,888
I didn't want them
to ever leave.

157
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,890
Tell me you love me, yeah,

158
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:25,593
tell me you love me...

159
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,229
No. No, no, no.

160
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,097
No, no, no!

161
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,734
Help me!

162
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,937
Pretty sure they're dead.

163
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,472
Well, almost.

164
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,907
Please call the doctor.
They need help.

165
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,611
Not sure what I can do
to help them.

166
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,580
They'll be messing themselves
soon enough.

167
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:48,615
I'll come back.

168
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,482
Please.

169
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,451
Postmortem excrement

170
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,619
is the biggest

171
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,354
stain challenge of them all.

172
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,722
No! No, please, help.

173
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,625
Please...

174
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,601
<i>I had done an excellent job.</i>

175
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,957
<i>I wouldn't be abandoned</i>
<i>this time.</i>

176
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,105
<i>Not for five days.</i>

177
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,679
<i>On day two, he showed up.</i>

178
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,319
<i>He tortured me for three days.</i>

179
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:32,156
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

180
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,810
After that...

181
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:42,513
this was my spot.

182
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,471
It's the only place
I had ever experienced any real

183
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,308
belonging or happiness.

184
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,910
You have serious
abandonment issues.

185
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:58,515
That's why I saved you.

186
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,517
I'm flattered.

187
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,519
Yeah, well,
I don't want you, bitch.

188
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:07,324
I want John.

189
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:08,958
And he left.

190
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,294
With that battle-ax
of a wife

191
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:16,633
and your sweet angel child.

192
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,136
I want him back in the hotel
and I want him dead,

193
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,040
here with me,
forever. So...

194
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm gonna need you to do it.

195
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:34,550
Your timing is off.

196
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,354
I'm gonna get you well.

197
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:40,356
I'm gonna bring you blood.

198
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,724
As much as you need.

199
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:43,726
Not human blood.

200
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,229
I need blood like mine.

201
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,698
Would you bring Donovan here?

202
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,272
I can feed off him.

203
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:54,936
Just a little bit at a time.

204
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:56,238
Until I'm well.

205
00:12:57,696 --> 00:12:58,807
Donovan is dead.

206
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,716
He was very beautiful.

207
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:23,931
Do you remember where

208
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,266
your room is?

209
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,568
I'll take you.

210
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:35,943
You want something to eat?

211
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,812
How 'bout some fruit?

212
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,014
It's rotten.

213
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,419
How long has it been
since you were home?

214
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:47,954
Too long.

215
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:53,860
Now that we have Holden, it's
gonna go back to the way it was.

216
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:57,359
We're gonna be a family again.

217
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,866
How are you going to
explain this to Grandma?

218
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,367
He looks like a baby.

219
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:03,369
Holden's supposed to be
my big brother.

220
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:05,038
Grandma doesn't have to know.

221
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,773
This is our secret.

222
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:08,407
As long as we take our medicine,

223
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,342
we'll be healthy.

224
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:13,145
You mean drink blood?

225
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:15,799
Is that what happened to Jasper?

226
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,417
Are you going to eat me, too?
Of course not.

227
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:19,785
You'll always be safe.

228
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,787
How are you going to eat?

229
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:23,322
That's my job.

230
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:24,997
It's nothing
you have to worry about.

231
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:42,640
What the hell
are they doing here?

232
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,476
You're getting worse.

233
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,644
You're not healing yourself

234
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,012
the way you should be.

235
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,747
You said it. You need blood.

236
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,383
Your blood.

237
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,385
No.

238
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:56,153
There must be another way.

239
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,122
You don't have a lot of options.

240
00:14:58,156 --> 00:14:59,909
And you need a fix.

241
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,826
Now.

242
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,967
It'll kill them.

243
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:14,705
I'd rather die.

244
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:21,845
You're not saving anyone.

245
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,715
What do you think's
gonna happen to your children?

246
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,717
Hmm?

247
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:30,654
It won't take long for Iris
and Liz to mow them down.

248
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,991
No!

249
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:37,994
Please. Please, I can't.

250
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:39,996
I can't!
It's okay, Mommy.

251
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,898
Let us help you.

252
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,810
My sweet... my...

253
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:01,216
Hold on to Mommy.

254
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,218
No!

255
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:06,755
<i>No!</i>

256
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,833
You did it.

257
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,870
Big hotel.

258
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:23,730
Big furnace.

259
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:30,879
Thank you.

260
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,883
I just couldn't have him
going down that chute

261
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,384
like so much trash.

262
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:39,887
Of course not.

263
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:42,423
Is there any sign of her?

264
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,461
Not yet. Hopefully she crawled
into some corner and died.

265
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,229
It's not likely.

266
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:50,664
No.

267
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,067
Could I have a minute?

268
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:55,002
Oh.

269
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,874
Oh, Donovan.

270
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:41,514
Sweet baby.

271
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,951
You did always have
that mean streak.

272
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:52,992
I always said that orneriness
came from your father.

273
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,063
But that's not so.

274
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,433
That was pure me.

275
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:07,206
Oh, we were so much alike.

276
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:12,178
Maybe that's why
we couldn't be close.

277
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,031
But I did love you.

278
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:24,490
I swear to God I did.

279
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:52,283
How are you feeling?

280
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:59,057
Leave me alone.

281
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,074
My goodness,

282
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:13,170
did we have a little accident?

283
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,274
I want every speck of him gone.

284
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,378
Oh, my.

285
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,713
Who was that?

286
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,115
My son.

287
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:30,355
Would you like him
back in the can?

288
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:32,223
No.

289
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,960
Use the vacuum.

290
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,297
Where's the bag?

291
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:41,732
It's bagless.

292
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,139
I'll have him
all scooped up in a jiffy!

293
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,609
Are you sure this is a good idea?

294
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,478
We can't go back now.
We didn't kill her.

295
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,280
We'll never get another
chance like that.

296
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:02,448
She is gonna eat me the minute

297
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:03,983
you let her out of that cage.

298
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,451
Ramona and I go way back.

299
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:07,320
I can guarantee you
that she'll at least

300
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:09,189
listen to me.

301
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:11,191
And we share a common enemy.

302
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:12,958
And, hopefully,
she'll see that that

303
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:15,961
supersedes any recent mistakes
you may have made.

304
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,190
So we're desperate.

305
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:19,959
Just out of options.

306
00:21:19,993 --> 00:21:22,461
We'll just point her in
the direction of the Countess

307
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:24,296
and get out of the way.

308
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,698
Uh-huh.

309
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:28,332
What could go wrong?

310
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,351
What the...? Oh!

311
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:51,923
Oh. How... did
that get in here?

312
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:57,495
Oh...

313
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:00,697
Look at all of them.

314
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:02,900
Oh, God.

315
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,048
That sad soul.

316
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,353
They've all been drained.

317
00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:25,722
This place is a meat locker.

318
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:41,037
Oh...

319
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,705
Run...!

320
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:43,906
- Run!
- Oh, God!

321
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:46,142
Not another step!

322
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:48,378
And don't you dare point

323
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:49,745
either of those things at me!

324
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:56,319
So...

325
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:58,588
the Countess sent <i>you</i> here

326
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:01,104
to finish me off.

327
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:02,724
- Oh...
- Well, the game isn't over

328
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,859
till <i>I</i> do the finishin'.

329
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:06,861
Liz Taylor?

330
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:09,231
Since when are you working
with the Countess?

331
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:11,100
No, no, no, no.

332
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:13,368
We're all working
against the Countess.

333
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:14,436
Not that one.

334
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:19,074
Bitch put me in that hole
and made me hungry

335
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:20,409
for blood and revenge.

336
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:22,877
Eatin' you...

337
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:26,047
is gonna make me feel
doubly good.

338
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,049
- Told you.
- No.

339
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:29,334
We need her.

340
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:31,953
We need all of us
if we're going to end

341
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:33,455
the Countess's grip
on this place,

342
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,657
her grip on all of us.
Please,

343
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:38,126
- sweetheart.
- Don't you "sweetheart" me.

344
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,495
I have been scratched at,
conked out,

345
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,497
and locked up.

346
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:43,931
But Mama...

347
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,232
is on a course correction.

348
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:47,585
Ramona...

349
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:49,637
I should have listened to you
about the Countess,

350
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,083
but I was a love-addled idiot,

351
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,575
so, please... forgive me.

352
00:23:57,912 --> 00:23:59,380
I feel you.

353
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:03,618
But I'm just not feeling
like myself right now.

354
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,154
I fed...

355
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:09,823
but something
not agreein' with me.

356
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:12,092
Oh. Oh, but we can fix that.

357
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:13,960
- Oh, yeah.
- I have...

358
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,762
some of the Countess's
purified stash

359
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:17,096
up at the lounge.

360
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:19,633
I don't need any
of her baby aspirin.

361
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,301
I need to take a life

362
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,436
to bring me back to life!

363
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:26,306
Well... that can
also be arranged.

364
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,144
We can't just
go out on the street

365
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,646
and bash somebody in the head.

366
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,814
If you have another idea,
I'm all ears.

367
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:38,851
Hello?

368
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:40,519
Is anybody here?

369
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,406
Hey, either of y'all work here?

370
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:49,395
Dinner is served.

371
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:58,230
Did you have a reservation?

372
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,439
Uh, yeah. One name:

373
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:01,540
Queenie.

374
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:04,976
Oh, yes, I have you.

375
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:06,444
And you're gonna be
staying with us

376
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:07,846
for three nights.

377
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,148
- Are you traveling alone?
- Just me.

378
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,984
And what brings
you to L.A.?

379
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,385
Drew Carey.

380
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,688
I'm here to win big money
on <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

381
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,156
Wonderful.

382
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:19,324
Yeah.

383
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:20,992
Well, I hope you

384
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:22,994
get called to
"come on down!"

385
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,663
That's actually guaranteed.

386
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,498
Between you and me,

387
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,234
my Supreme did
a little somethin'-somethin'

388
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:31,001
to my ticket, so...

389
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:32,501
it's enchanted.

390
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,672
I thought you looked familiar!

391
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:36,374
I saw you...

392
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:38,909
I saw you on CNN!

393
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:40,411
You're one of the witches!

394
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:41,713
My God.

395
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:42,714
Oh, my God.

396
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:44,749
Oh! It's this
amazing story.

397
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:46,417
There's a whole gaggle of them.

398
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:47,952
They're a bona fide coven.

399
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:50,421
They wear chic black,
and they do spells...

400
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:53,057
Oh, my goodness! I hope
you didn't have to marry Satan

401
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:54,325
or anything to join.

402
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,217
That's actually ignorant
and offensive.

403
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:57,582
We're born that way.

404
00:25:57,702 --> 00:25:59,663
We'll all part
of an ancient bloodline.

405
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,064
Blood?

406
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:02,366
Really?

407
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,334
That's fascinating.

408
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:06,403
Liz, why don't you go upstairs

409
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:09,172
and make sure
she has everything in her room

410
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:10,840
she'll need during her stay.

411
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,009
Oh. Of course.

412
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:15,245
I'll get right on that.

413
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,381
I'll just be a few minutes.

414
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:18,749
Mm-hmm.

415
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,589
Ooh.

416
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:29,058
There's a lot of bad juju
in this room.

417
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:30,927
Oh, that's... the
previous tenant.

418
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:32,032
He's gone.

419
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:34,898
Ice machine is down the hall,
and local calls are free.

420
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,070
Plenty of fluffy towels

421
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:42,438
in the bathroom...
I just checked.

422
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:44,440
You're all set.

423
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:49,645
No. I have a dark feeling.

424
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,015
I'll take another room, please.

425
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,617
Oh, we're close to capacity,

426
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,218
but I'll check
when I go downstairs.

427
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,893
Meanwhile, you can freshen up.

428
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:00,823
You'll want to be
tip-top for the taping.

429
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,383
Bitch, when's the last time
you saw a dermatologist?

430
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:32,987
Okay, you are obviously trippin'.
What do you want?

431
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:34,656
Blood.

432
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:44,094
Yeah, you clearly don't know
who you're messing with.

433
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:49,971
That's right...

434
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:51,672
I'm a human voodoo doll, bitch.

435
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:54,242
Any hurt on me gonna go
right back to you!

436
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:56,944
You're a damn witch!

437
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:59,180
Witch's blood
will make me strong.

438
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:01,448
I ain't nobody's
protein shake, bitch!

439
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:15,729
That's all you got?

440
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,799
Nothing?

441
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:23,272
I'm not letting
some raggedy-ass,

442
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:25,672
red-dotted, blood-whore freak

443
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,841
take up another
second of my time.

444
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,877
It's my vacation, bitch!

445
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:32,413
<i>The Price Is Right</i> is waitin'.

446
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:33,679
Come on down!

447
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:37,550
Why aren't you...

448
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:41,186
Your magic has
nowhere to go, my dear.

449
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,056
You see, I'm not alive.

450
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,191
You may be a witch...

451
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,128
...but I am a ghost.

452
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:53,265
Ooh.

453
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,534
A shame she had to die.

454
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:59,151
This one had a flair
for the dark arts.

455
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,845
Who the hell are you?

456
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,580
James Patrick March.

457
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:13,351
You saved me for a reason.

458
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,054
I need you to kill the Countess.

459
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,765
Looks to me
you qualify for the job.

460
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:22,861
And ruin my one chance
for happiness? Oh, no.

461
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:26,300
She must die in this hotel, but she can't
suspect I had anything to do with it.

462
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,266
You're the only one
strong enough.

463
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,069
Then she'll be bound
to the Cortez.

464
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,104
She's on the verge
of absconding forever,

465
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,039
and I will not allow it.

466
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,433
Drink up, darling.

467
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:39,027
You're going to need
your strength.

468
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,502
Do you swear you haven't taken

469
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,936
any drugs in the last 30 days?

470
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,473
I'm a cop.
I can test you.

471
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,807
Do I have to test you?

472
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:26,088
Alex?

473
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,425
Hello?

474
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:39,768
Alex?

475
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,771
Scarlett?

476
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,434
Hello, John.

477
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:17,596
You?

478
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,078
What'd you do with my family?

479
00:31:20,198 --> 00:31:21,654
I didn't do anything.

480
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,904
You know I'm trapped here.

481
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:27,090
And you want nothing more...

482
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,360
than for me to be
trapped here with you.

483
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:32,263
Well, that's right.

484
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:35,066
And I would've taken a hammer
to the back of your head

485
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,433
the second you walked in, but...

486
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:39,070
he wouldn't let me.

487
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:43,874
March... are you saying
he took my family?

488
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,442
You made him a promise, John.

489
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:48,444
Where are they?
One last kill,

490
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,381
and then
I can take you to your family.

491
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,950
They're safe.

492
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,054
For now.

493
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:01,858
He's never gonna leave me alone

494
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:03,500
until I give him what he wants.

495
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,734
"Thou shalt not commit murder."

496
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:09,299
That's all that's left.

497
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:12,468
I need to find a murderer.

498
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,247
Well, that shouldn't be
too difficult.

499
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,647
Oh.

500
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:27,417
Damn...!

501
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:29,251
I hate it when a woman

502
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,921
looks better in one of
my outfits than I do.

503
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:34,123
I know, I <i>know.</i>

504
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,658
I ought to be in pictures,

505
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:37,960
'cept I can't be photographed.

506
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:39,261
Anyways...

507
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:42,932
we have some
accessories for you.

508
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:44,333
I don't need

509
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,600
any of that.

510
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:47,937
I got witch's blood in my veins.

511
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:50,372
Plus, a golden opportunity.

512
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:52,908
The Countess has never
been more vulnerable.

513
00:32:52,943 --> 00:32:55,644
I don't need any
convincing, sisters.

514
00:32:55,678 --> 00:32:58,580
It's time... for me to rise

515
00:32:58,614 --> 00:33:00,149
and her...

516
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:01,783
to fall.

517
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:52,867
It's not the Shalimar
that gives you away.

518
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:57,638
It's your blood.

519
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,737
I've never known another woman

520
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:03,544
whose blood smelled
like walnuts.

521
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:06,818
Yours still smells
like black licorice.

522
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:10,151
You look incredible.

523
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:11,685
What have you been eating?

524
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,915
I just had me a witch.

525
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,856
Really?

526
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:21,829
I feel like grizzly bears
are running through my veins.

527
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,197
I feel strong.

528
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:27,000
Strong enough to take me down?

529
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:33,106
I could have Yogi Bear
running though my veins

530
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:34,942
and I could take you down.

531
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:37,778
And I imagine that locking you
up in that hallway hasn't

532
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,113
softened your rage towards me.

533
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:43,951
I fantasized about coming here
and ending you

534
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:45,719
every day.

535
00:34:45,754 --> 00:34:47,788
And what did you settle on?

536
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:51,023
You always did like to...

537
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:52,325
take your time.

538
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,993
I haven't decided yet.

539
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:55,695
I've never been one to plan.

540
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,531
I prefer improvisation.

541
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,407
I'm weak, but I'm
still the champ.

542
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,105
You may beat me,

543
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,874
but you're not getting out
of here without

544
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:09,943
at least
a severe, lifelong limp.

545
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,945
You're bullshitting me?

546
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:16,215
I think everyone
in the world thinks

547
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,084
they're either blessed
or cursed.

548
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:24,290
I've come to realize
that I'm neither.

549
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:30,896
I am a curse.

550
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,266
Nobody that gets within
ten feet of me survives.

551
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:39,505
And God help you if you get

552
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,507
right up close, skin to skin.

553
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,509
Then you're really screwed.

554
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:45,811
You're trying
to make me feel sorry for you?

555
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,546
I'm trying to apologize.

556
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,217
I'm not used to this.

557
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,419
Cut me some slack, bitch.

558
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,727
What if I gave you the hotel?

559
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:06,964
Hah. Severance pay
for 20 years of hell?

560
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:11,676
I liked staying here
because it made me feel safe.

561
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:16,674
But I see now that it's just
because I was so comfortable

562
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,444
living in heartbreak.

563
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,646
I don't want to be here anymore.

564
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,618
It's harder to kill you

565
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,787
when I'm sitting
in the same room as you.

566
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:33,957
Easier to carve your heart out
of your chest and eat it

567
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,960
when you're just a monster
in my mind.

568
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,796
That sounds
like a dream way to die.

569
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,831
So erotic.

570
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,847
I want to go.

571
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,384
Just me and my baby boy.

572
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,654
Okay... kill me.

573
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,834
But screw me first.

574
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:10,526
* You adore me

575
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,997
* You adore me

576
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,967
* You adore me

577
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:22,171
* I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna be adored *

578
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:26,175
* I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna be adored *

579
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,513
* I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna be adored *

580
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:32,348
* I wanna, I wanna

581
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:35,283
* I gotta be adored...

582
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:56,538
* I wanna be adored.

583
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,908
Give yourself a smile, John.

584
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:13,855
Ten Commandments.

585
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:16,390
Each victim a worthy
representative of their sin.

586
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:20,695
And the last one:
Thou shalt not commit murder.

587
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:23,064
I suppose you or I could
be sitting on that shelf,

588
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:26,067
but your choice was inspired.

589
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,737
Couldn't have worked out any
better if I had planned it myself.

590
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:32,439
Aren't you proud
of our boy, Sally?

591
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:34,608
I always knew he was the one.

592
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:36,950
How do you feel, John?

593
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,746
- It must be exhilarating.
- Yeah.

594
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:41,615
A true sense of completeness.

595
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,584
I'm completely done.

596
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:45,986
No!

597
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,622
No!
He belongs with me!

598
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:50,523
No! I need him alive.
Out in the world.

599
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:52,525
There's more at stake here
than your womanly desires.

600
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,227
I have great plans for this one.

601
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:56,196
Stop now before
my addiction demon

602
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,530
becomes your constant companion!

603
00:38:57,565 --> 00:38:58,932
No more plans.

604
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:01,267
Take me to my family.

605
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:03,770
- John... John!
- Please!

606
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,541
Do you remember
the first time, Miss Evers?

607
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,020
When I had intimacies
with the opposite sex?

608
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:28,849
The first time you realized
you were a ghost.

609
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:34,421
Oh! Well, I was very
frightened and confused,

610
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,724
but I had you to steady my hand.

611
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:38,559
You were my rock, Mr. March.

612
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:39,727
Yes, yes.

613
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,296
The Countess
will be similarly unmoored.

614
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,390
It's up to us
to provide that ballast.

615
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,300
I want everything to be perfect.

616
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:47,635
What's for dinner?

617
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:49,303
Chipped beef on toast.

618
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,772
To serve my queen?!

619
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,440
This is an outrage!

620
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:11,190
Darling, you look
ravishing. Come in.

621
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:12,826
Take my hand.

622
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,794
It'll take some time
to acclimate yourself

623
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,030
to your new state.

624
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:21,367
How do you feel?

625
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,703
There's no pain but...

626
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:26,305
no passion.

627
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,307
No passion, no fire.

628
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,476
The passion was
in front of your nose,

629
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,046
if only you'd opened
your eyes to see it.

630
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:38,418
At least I don't have
to spend an eternity

631
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,753
as a pear-shaped frump.

632
00:40:40,787 --> 00:40:42,755
Well!

633
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:46,459
Yes. Uh... you'll find

634
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,961
some frustrations, no doubt,
as you adjust to the vicissitude

635
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:51,464
of your new life.
The inability

636
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:54,467
to step outside the confines
of this hotel, for one.

637
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,870
But there is no profit
accentuating the limitations.

638
00:40:57,904 --> 00:41:00,673
On the balance, we are blessed.

639
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:02,975
We are together again, my love.

640
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:05,010
That one fact erases
a multitude of sins.

641
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,068
I can finally forgive you for
turning me in to the police.

642
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,551
I didn't turn you in.

643
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:17,856
There is no need for any
further prevarication, darling.

644
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:20,893
We are reduced to our essence.

645
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:24,362
I'm not lying.

646
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:25,731
If I wanted you dead,

647
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:27,967
I would have killed you myself.

648
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:33,939
Then who?

649
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:35,774
You should've left!

650
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,508
Why didn't you leave?!

651
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:41,780
I knew
you would eventually get bored.

652
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:44,783
Why did you have to die here?

653
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:47,019
It was me.
I did it!

654
00:41:47,053 --> 00:41:48,720
I wanted you for myself!

655
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:51,723
I left the handkerchief
for the police.

656
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:53,525
I knew that they would come,

657
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:56,894
and I knew that you would never
allow yourself to be captured.

658
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:02,046
I wanted us to die together.

659
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:09,202
So that you can see
the depth of my devotion.

660
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:14,895
While this one
resented every moment

661
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:18,150
she was obligated
to be in your presence.

662
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:21,586
I would happily
stand behind you,

663
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,455
waiting to serve,

664
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:25,923
savoring your every word.

665
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:30,107
Have you seen no evidence
of my love?

666
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:37,434
Do you feel nothing at all?

667
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:40,672
Can you see me now?

668
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:45,877
I have laid myself bare.

669
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,747
I've dwelt in silence
for so long.

670
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:51,749
Give me a word, Mr. March.

671
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,679
Let me be happy.

672
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:12,969
Get out.

673
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,176
You...

674
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,610
are banished from my presence.

675
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:36,226
I-I feel...

676
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,161
strangely free.

677
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:49,873
I will no longer wait on you...

678
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:53,309
...and your whore.

679
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:56,546
You have nothing.

680
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,680
What else would you

681
00:43:57,715 --> 00:43:59,515
possibly do?

682
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,554
There are more stains
in heaven and earth

683
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:07,660
than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

684
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:37,093
Mm.

685
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,236
A toast.

686
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,209
How thrilled I am
to have you across from me.

687
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:03,412
Not once a month,
but from now on.

688
00:45:06,944 --> 00:45:10,619
Until the sun falls from the sky

689
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:14,489
and the heavens burn
in conflagration.

690
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:37,798
