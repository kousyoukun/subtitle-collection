1
00:00:03,747 --> 00:00:06,516
<i>Women age differently</i>
<i>than men do.</i>

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>In a man, the left ventricle,</i>

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:10,719
<i>the one that pumps red blood</i>
<i>into the body,</i>

4
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:13,689
<i>gets larger, thicker</i>
<i>as he gets older.</i>

5
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,292
<i>In a woman, it shrinks.</i>

6
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,894
<i>I am now more than</i>
<i>a century old.</i>

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,433
<i>My heart must be just</i>
<i>a few karats at this point.</i>

8
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,865
<i>There is room there</i>
<i>for very little,</i>

9
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:30,755
<i>so what still fits inside</i>
<i>means more to me than ever.</i>

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,424
<i>It means everything.</i>

11
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:40,264
<i>The last 100 years</i>
<i>of my immortal life</i>

12
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:42,837
<i>have been a lie.</i>

13
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:45,269
<i>The illusion of control.</i>

14
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:48,872
<i>In truth,</i>
<i>I have controlled nothing.</i>

15
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:57,014
<i>I have surrounded myself</i>
<i>with fools and flatterers,</i>

16
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:00,985
<i>put my trust in those</i>
<i>who could not be trusted.</i>

17
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,387
I have a sneaking suspicion

18
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:06,790
you're going to miss your train.

19
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:08,458
<i>Enemies without.</i>

20
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:10,660
<i>Enemies within.</i>

21
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,964
<i>It is time to construct</i>
<i>something new.</i>

22
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,431
<i>Something durable.</i>

23
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:22,472
<i>With fortifications of iron,</i>
<i>stone and steel.</i>

24
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:24,908
<i>I will not be ruled.</i>

25
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:26,309
<i>I will not be managed.</i>

26
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:28,044
We move all of this.

27
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,680
I pop in a dance floor
over there.

28
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,449
I'll fly in Calvin
to do the music.

29
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,519
Let's not have some
big vulgar display.

30
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:39,054
I'd rather we just do
something simple and intimate.

31
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:41,857
All I need is you,
a justice of the peace,

32
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,959
Lachlan to bear the rings,

33
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:46,395
and sprays of
lilies of the valley.

34
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:47,696
Are you kidding?

35
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,965
Will Drake is getting married.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,536
This wedding needs to be
the event of the season.

37
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,838
Trust me, I'm a showman.

38
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,673
This is what I do.

39
00:01:57,707 --> 00:01:59,241
Well, I'm no show pony.

40
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,843
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:03,512
I love you, Will.

42
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:06,481
You need me, I'm restorative,

43
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,550
but you let the world

44
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:12,020
suck you dry of any inspiration,

45
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,855
and now you want to
invite them back in.

46
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:16,124
I can't be a part of that.

47
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,892
It's them or me.

48
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:19,027
It's you.

49
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:20,828
It's-it's always you.

50
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:23,532
If you want something intimate,
then that's what it'll be.

51
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,901
This is your wedding.

52
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:29,003
It's our wedding.

53
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,505
You design my gown.

54
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,007
I'll take care of
everything else.

55
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,620
I suppose it would be
a little awkward

56
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:48,755
with all that paparazzi around

57
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,858
and you being so...

58
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:54,228
camera shy, as it were.

59
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:57,398
Have the flowers delivered
by Wednesday morning.

60
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:59,600
You're kidding.

61
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,068
Right?

62
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:04,137
Bitch, do you honestly think

63
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:06,406
I would lift a finger
to help you with your wedding

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,541
after what you did?

65
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:10,543
Tristan never loved you.

66
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,946
He didn't know how to love.

67
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,448
You didn't know him...

68
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,450
at all!

69
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:21,154
He did love me.

70
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,926
You may have taken him away,

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,929
but I will not let you
take that.

72
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,898
Buy your own damn flowers.

73
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:37,803
<i>My largess betrays me.</i>

74
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:40,140
<i>Those to whom I have given much</i>

75
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:43,809
<i>repay me only with resentment</i>
<i>and ingratitude.</i>

76
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:47,580
<i>Security can be found only</i>
<i>by looking into oneself.</i>

77
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,149
<i>Others only make</i>
<i>a mess of things.</i>

78
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:50,816
The body of a homeless man,

79
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,085
who appears to have been
exsanguinated,

80
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,622
was found in
the City of Industry last night.

81
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:57,823
No word on how
the man's blood was drained,

82
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:02,061
or if this might be related
to a series of similar murders

83
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,930
that have taken place in the
city over the past few weeks.

84
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:08,200
Police are searching
for a small group of children

85
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:10,235
who may have witnessed
the attack.

86
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:14,106
<i>A woman can only be</i>
<i>pushed so far.</i>

87
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:17,009
<i>And I'm right on the edge.</i>

88
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,613
<i>I'm weary.</i>

89
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:24,950
Hello.

90
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:27,286
<i>Weary of the world failing me.</i>

91
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,322
Yeah, I think I found your boy.

92
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:35,126
<i>Weary of the steady drip, drip</i>
<i>of disappointment.</i>

93
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:38,197
<i>I won't be disappointed again.</i>

94
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,944
May I come in?

95
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:56,948
Only if you kiss me first.

96
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:13,997
<i>Oh, God.</i>

97
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,900
I forgot how good
you feel inside me.

98
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:33,883
Oh, God.

99
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,053
Why did I ever let you leave me?

100
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,988
You didn't let me.

101
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:42,225
You threw me out.

102
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,860
Oh, yeah.

103
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:46,396
That's right.

104
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,398
You should have fought harder.

105
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,368
Well, I was going to, but you
killed him before I could.

106
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:54,403
Promise me...

107
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,640
from now on, it's just me.

108
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,875
Forever.

109
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,378
Monogamy, Donovan?

110
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:05,013
Commitment.

111
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:07,683
We can do what we want
with whoever we want...

112
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:08,917
Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,720
...but you love only me.

114
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:21,129
I swear it.

115
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,268
But I won't make
the same mistakes again.

116
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:32,473
It's going to require
more than words.

117
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,109
It requires actions.

118
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,612
Whatever you want, baby.

119
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,983
Good.

120
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,252
I'm getting married
on Wednesday.

121
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,822
What?

122
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:50,792
Relax. I'll be
a widow by Thursday.

123
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,795
A rich widow.

124
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,070
I want to make a clean
start of things.

125
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:06,240
Clear away all the
detritus of our lives.

126
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,742
Great, who should we kill first?

127
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,978
After your betrothed, I mean.

128
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,951
Let's make a list.

129
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:22,311
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>

130
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:37,117
Sorry,

131
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,087
douche bag convention
is over at the Hilton.

132
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,789
We have a reservation.

133
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:44,291
Under my name, Stormcock.

134
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,593
Okay.

135
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:50,798
Would that be a...

136
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:54,935
last name or the whole thing,
like Madonna?

137
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,604
Do you have the reservation
or not?

138
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,439
It's right here.

139
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:05,878
So, uh,

140
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,714
what are you guys planning
on doing up there?

141
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,249
Oh, nothing unusual.

142
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,783
Straight sex, blow job.

143
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,419
I'll probably rim her.

144
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:13,753
You're not sticking

145
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,154
your tongue in my ass.

146
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:18,225
Nothing like a prude porn star.

147
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,327
I'll bring up some extra towels

148
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:21,794
after you've settled in.

149
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,996
Thank you.

150
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,836
<i>I got nothing</i>
<i>against pornography,</i>

151

<i>when it's done right.</i>

152
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,272
<i>I went and saw</i> Deep Throat

153
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,074
<i>at the Royal</i>
<i>on Santa Monica Boulevard,</i>

154
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,176
<i>just like everyone else.</i>

155
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,246
<i>Hell, even William Buckley went.</i>

156
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,485
That was shot with real actors,
<i>on sets, with a script.</i>

157
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,855
<i>Nowadays, any couple of yahoos</i>

<i>In the past, I'll admit it,</i>
<i>I was an enabler.</i>

164
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,014
<i>I'd take the money</i>
<i>and hand them a key</i>

165
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:20,017
<i>and try not to think about</i>
<i>what was happening upstairs.</i>

166
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:23,421
But ever since I was converted,
<i>I can't turn away.</i>

167
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,223
<i>I don't want to.</i>

168
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,530
<i>It's a new me.</i>

169
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,799
<i>I'm becoming</i>
<i>a goddamn Dirty Harriet.</i>

170
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,904
<i>Porn hurts people.</i>

171
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,906
<i>Hurts the girls who think</i>
<i>they need to screw like that.</i>

172
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,443
<i>Hurts the guys who think</i>
<i>girls want to screw like that.</i>

173
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,312
<i>I'm not uptight,</i>

174
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:51,348
<i>I just don't want it going on</i>
<i>in my hotel anymore.</i>

175
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:54,918
<i>Donovan will like</i>
<i>his strong new mother.</i>

176
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:58,588
<i>Hell, I'm an example</i>
<i>for mothers everywhere now.</i>

177
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:03,026
I told you
you were being too loud.

178
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,261
I'm always loud
when I'm faking it.

179
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,530
What the hell?

180
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:07,564
Douche bag.

181
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,567
Oh, my God.

182
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,473
Please, I don't want to die.

183
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,142
I don't want to...

184
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,868
Hello, Iris.

185
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:47,535
Dono, what are you doing here?

186
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,871
Wow.

187
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:51,606
Wow. I mean,
I heard what you did

188
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,343
to those hipsters
a couple weeks ago,

189
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:56,044
about how you were ready

190
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,413
to off The Countess's kids,
but I thought

191
00:11:58,447 --> 00:11:59,814
it was just tall tales.

192
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,951
But you have
clearly come into your own.

193
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:04,486
'Cause of you.

194
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,922
But, listen,

195
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:08,590
it's not safe for you here.

196
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:10,124
There's been a problem.

197
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:13,261
Someone let
Bartholomew out of his room.

198
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:14,495
Shit.

199
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,630
I nearly lost him.

200
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:19,166
I demand to know
who's responsible.

201
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,168
Well, wasn't me.

202
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:23,271
Is the life you're protecting

203
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,606
really worth losing your own?

204
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,641
Or your son's?

205
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,179
Donovan had nothing
to do with it.

206
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,919
It was Ramona Royale.

207
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:39,921
I'm worried that she's
gonna put it together

208
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,923
that the three of us
are in cahoots.

209
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,223
We need a plan "B."

210
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:44,525
I'm way ahead of you.

211
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,828
The Countess thinks
I'm back with her.

212
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,631
That's why I'm here.

213
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,903
Tell me she doesn't
have her hooks in you.

214
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:57,905
Not at all, Mother.

215
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:01,542
Look...

216
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:03,622
just sit tight, keep quiet.

217
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,712
The less you know, the better.

218
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:08,682
And when I need you,
I'll let you know.

219
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,883
Hey, hello?
Can somebody call the police?

220
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,392
No. No, no!

221
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:28,890
We are hot shit, buddy.

222
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:31,629
I can't believe
you're marrying a girl.

223
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:34,098
I'm gonna be blunt.

224
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:36,333
Your father is bisexual.

225
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:38,869
People think that word
means something dirty,

226
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,403
but it doesn't.

227
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,740
It means I like men and
I like women, equally.

228
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,944
People don't understand,
so they treat me like I'm weird.

229
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,946
Or like I'm trying
to hide something.

230
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,548
Or that...
That you only like guys?

231
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,417
Yeah, something like that.

232
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,289
And if you're lucky,

233
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:01,524
once in your life,

234
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,494
you find somebody
who really understands you.

235
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,932
And I didn't think someone
like that existed for me.

236
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,734
Until I met The Countess.

237
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:13,804
She's the one.

238
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,173
And when you meet the one,

239
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,276
you hold on tight
and you never let go.

240
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,378
Don't marry her.

241
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,081
She's not the one for you.

242
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,349
- For any man.
- Excuse me, who are you?

243
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,685
- How did you get in here?
- That's Ms. Evers.

244
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,953
- She works here.
- Would you like me

245
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:33,455
to bring you a
knife, Mr. Drake?

246
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,390
Perhaps a pistol?

247
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:37,093
Or are you the type
who would prefer

248
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,794
to hurl yourself out a window?

249
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,830
Excuse me?
Well, clearly you want to

250
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,098
commit suicide.

251
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,899
Why else would you agree

252
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:46,468
to marry that poisonous
leech of a woman?

253
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,137
You are way out of line.

254
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:51,507
If you marry The Countess,
you will die.

255
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,807
And your boy, too, probably.

256
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:53,926
Get the hell out of here.

257
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:56,377
You must believe me, sir.
Once she puts the ring

258
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,513
on your finger,
she will bleed you dry.

259
00:14:58,547 --> 00:14:59,914
I have a prenup
to protect me from that.

260
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,516
Get the hell out of here.

261
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,885
You're fired.
I was supposed to be married!

262
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,620
I loved him.

263
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,857
But he chose
to love her instead.

264
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,860
My father always said to marry

265
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,594
a homely woman.

266
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,397
Less trouble.

267
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:18,399
I disagree.

268
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,002
I adore you.
I depend on you.

269
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:22,637
Look at the suit I'm wearing.

270
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,405
It was covered in bile,
literal bile,

271
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,407
from a pullman
I knifed the other day.

272
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,275
It's like nothing
was ever there.

273
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,979
You're a genius.

274
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:36,016
But The Countess
is a creature from heaven.

275
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,651
Style,

276
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,954
grace, beauty.

277
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:44,692
It's not your fault
you were graced with...

278
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:47,327
different gifts.

279
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,330
No one survives her.

280
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:51,832
Please leave.

281
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:54,201
I never want to see you
in this hotel again.

282
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,536
So be it.

283
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,240
One day,

284
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:03,310
very soon, you will understand.

285
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:06,613
You will know nothing
but pain, hmm?

286
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,181
And I will be there.

287
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,251
And you will reach out to me
for help and mercy,

288
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:15,088
and in return, I will watch you
die with a smile on my face,

289
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:18,157
because I will know
that once you are gone,

290
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:20,993
I will get the chance
to clean the blood and shit

291
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:24,231
out of that pretty
formal wear of yours.

292
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:32,505
I just wanted to confirm
everything because it looks like

293
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,241
someone just tried
to open up this wall.

294
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,710
Yes, and I'm telling you now
to close it.

295
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:38,345
With a security door.

296
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:41,214
I'm turning this entire wing
into a secure archive

297
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,515
for Mr. Drake's
previous collections.

298
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,652
It needs to be impenetrable.

299
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:49,421
For insurance
purposes, of course.

300
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:52,125
I'd feel more comfortable if
we checked with the owner first.

301
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,360
We won't say anything to him.

302
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,195
It's a surprise.
A wedding gift.

303
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,830
When's the happy day?

304
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,166
I expect this all to
be done by tomorrow.

305
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,901
It's gonna
take at least a week

306
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,202
to order these parts.

307
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:05,171
You got a dozen
ceiling-mounted

308
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,039
I.P. cameras,
you got biometric...

309
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,142
The details
don't interest me, boo.

310
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:11,410
Results are the only thing
that matters.

311
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,578
What you're asking
is impossible.

312
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:14,480
"In order
to attain the impossible,

313
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:16,149
one must attempt
the absurd."

314
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,652
Miguel de Cervantes.

315
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,654
Is this your decorator?

316
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:23,555
I'm the silent partner.

317
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,358
The lady has an eye
for improvements, does she not?

318
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,793
Well, as I was explaining,

319
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,461
there's a lot of moving parts.

320
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,363
You are clouding your mind
with the inconsequential.

321
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:32,531
It's quite simple.

322
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,301
This is a load-bearing wall.

323
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:36,302
Abundantly strong enough
for just about

324
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,903
any steel you lug up here.

325
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,738
After that, it's just a matter
of a few rivets.

326
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:41,407
I have extensive
experience on this.

327
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:42,874
Gather your materials
and your men,

328
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,443
and I will guide you through it.

329
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,144
I'll do what I can.

330
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,746
Yes, that's the spirit!

331
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,915
Make haste!
Much to accomplish!

332
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,487
Don't worry
your pretty head, dear.

333
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,489
I'll see to it
you get what you want.

334
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:00,958
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?!

335
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,861
I'd kill you if you
weren't dead already.

336
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,797
You disgust me.

337
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:09,266
You're still upset
about the dago.

338
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,935
You screwed up, Jimmy.

339
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,638
You robbed me of the
thing I loved the most.

340
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,873
And now I never want
to see your pathetic,

341
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,042
miserable face ever again.

342
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:20,244
But we have an arrangement!

343
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:21,709
Please.

344
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:24,882
Our dinners are my sole
comfort in this stygian heap.

345
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,985
The chamber must be completed
by tomorrow.

346
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:35,893
You try to run, I will kill you so fast.

347
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:42,967
What the hell?

348
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,769
I was taught it was impolite
to visit a friend empty-handed.

349
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:47,271
Shut up.

350
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,840
I saw what kind
of friend you were.

351
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,943
Oh. You're a scared
little pussy, Donovan.

352
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,246
Couldn't find your balls

353
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,381
if they were dangling
by a string on her bedpost.

354
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,918
You could never be the kind
of man I need to take her down.

355
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,486
You're wrong.

356
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:08,892
I've been newly motivated.

357
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,828
Tell me more.

358
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,365
I love a good humiliation.

359
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,534
What did she do to you
that she hasn't already done?

360
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:20,136
She took me back.

361
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,393
Yeah.

362
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:24,874
The Countess told me
she made a mistake,

363
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,642
and I was the one.

364
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,191
Forever.

365
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,480
We made love
like it was the first time.

366
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,181
But you didn't believe her.

367
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:35,885
Oh, I did.

368
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,387
I did.

369
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,926
I wanted her even more
than I did before.

370
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,494
Because I knew what it felt like
to live without her.

371
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:47,996
And that's-that's
when I realized

372
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:51,833
it was never going away--
my desperation for her.

373
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,036
It is a horrible feeling
to have a craving

374
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,603
that you can never satiate.

375
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,105
It's an addiction.

376
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,774
I've been where you are.

377
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,947
Let me think
about where we go from here.

378
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,126
No, it has to be tonight.

379
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,050
She's getting married
to Will Drake tomorrow.

380
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,018
She's distracted.

381
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,054
Also, I slipped enough GHB

382
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,888
into her drink
to knock out an elephant.

383
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,890
This is the perfect time.

384
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:20,094
Oh, you got this all planned.

385
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:26,233
But... I can't pull the trigger.

386
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,269
You know that.

387
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:32,606
Well, I can appreciate a man

388
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,142
who understands
his own weakness.

389
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,483
Do we have a deal?

390
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,921
Let's drink to it.

391
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:05,605
You know why I want
to take The Countess down.

392
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,440
What took you so long
to look for revenge, huh?

393
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,678
How do I know I can trust you?

394
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,916
It's true.

395
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,520
She killed my man
over 20 years ago

396
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:22,822
and tossed me aside.

397
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,224
You know the only thing
worse than heartbreak?

398
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:28,727
Loneliness.

399
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:31,763
Knowing that
it's never going to end.

400
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:37,669
So, in my despair,

401
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:40,071
I went to the only place
in the world

402
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:44,342
where I knew for sure
there were people who loved me.

403
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,283
<i>Back to the only man</i>
<i>in the world</i>

404
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:57,283
<i>that I ever kneeled down for.</i>

405
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:18,469
Hello, Daddy.

406
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:22,773
Haven't seen you
in ten years, child.

407
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,928
You been doing
that plastic surgery?

408
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:26,449
Mm-mm.

409
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:27,450
You been crying.

410
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:28,451
You hurt?

411
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,065
Only on the inside.

412
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,254
Real bad.

413
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,256
Can I come in?

414
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,692
Please?

415
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:41,464
<i>I stayed for a few months.</i>

416
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:46,435
<i>Mama fed my soul, and Daddy</i>
<i>straightened me right out.</i>

417
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,838
<i>My daddy pointed his finger at</i>
<i>me and told me what was what,</i>

418
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:53,042
<i>and I felt like</i>
<i>a little girl again.</i>

419
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,477
<i>Safe.</i>

420
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:55,911
Daddy.

421
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:57,613
Daddy.

422
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:58,814
You all right?

423
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:00,248
Oh, I...

424
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:01,984
just lost my place there
for a moment.

425
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,251
What were we talking about?

426
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,756
Honey, it happens
all the time now.

427
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,991
"Cassie, where my keys?

428
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:11,426
Cassie, what day is it?"

429
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,695
You talk to the doctor, Daddy?

430
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,464
Huh?
Your mama is the sick one.

431
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,901
Only room for one in the family.

432
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,507
Daddy, let me drive you over
to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.

433
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,475
I can drive myself

434
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,877
if I want to go.

435
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:32,346
And I don't.

436
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,348
I'm fine.

437
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:36,250
Okay.

438
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:43,524
<i>When we lost Mama,</i>
<i>things just got worse.</i>

439
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,926
Easy.

440
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,362
<i>For 60 years, they were married.</i>

441
00:23:48,396 --> 00:23:52,365
<i>Without her, his mind</i>
<i>just couldn't find a reason</i>

442
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,034
<i>to hang on.</i>

443
00:23:56,887 --> 00:24:00,173
<i>He started to get lost</i>
<i>in his own neighborhood.</i>

444
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,642
<i>Couldn't find the house</i>
<i>that he had lived in</i>

445
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:05,712
<i>for 40 years.</i>

446
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,406
Daddy?

447
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:47,586
<i>To see this great man</i>
<i>laid so low.</i>

448
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,259
It's okay.

449
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:58,029
Everything's gonna be fine.

450
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:09,451
<i>I'd seen</i>
<i>what the virus had done.</i>

451
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,075
<i>Miraculous things.</i>

452
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,777
<i>Cuts healed.</i>

453
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,714
<i>Broken bones mended</i>
<i>in just a few days' time.</i>

454
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,316
<i>So why not?</i>

455
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,586
<i>Why couldn't it also</i>
<i>bring my daddy back to me?</i>

456
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,961
The forecast,
showers and thunderstorms today.

457
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,100
Cassie?

458
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,336
Cassie, that you?

459
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,604
<i>But neurons are not cuts,</i>

460
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:45,475
<i>and a diseased brain</i>
<i>is not a broken bone.</i>

461
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,678
<i>All the virus had done</i>

462
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,714
<i>was stop</i>
<i>the Alzheimer's progression.</i>

463
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:55,351
Mama's gone, Daddy.

464
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,754
You know that.

465
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:01,725
Who are you?

466
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,728
It's me, Daddy.

467
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,997
Your daughter.

468
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:13,435
<i>He was in no condition</i>
<i>to hunt for himself</i>

469
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:17,873
<i>or to even understand</i>
<i>what he had become.</i>

470
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:20,209
<i>So I took care of him.</i>

471
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:23,145
<i>I brought him back blood</i>
<i>from my kills.</i>

472
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,548
<i>I held out hope that since</i>
<i>he wasn't getting any worse,</i>

473
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,818
<i>maybe he'd get better.</i>

474
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:30,651
<i>But he didn't get any better.</i>

475
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:32,220
<i>He just stayed the same.</i>

476
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:33,988
<i>We both did.</i>

477
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,825
<i>For 20 years.</i>

478
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:43,031
Daddy?! Daddy!

479
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:47,802
Daddy.

480
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,123
<i>I couldn't let him live</i>
<i>like that,</i>

481
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:11,792
<i>frozen in amber.</i>

482
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:15,829
<i>So I gave him a Xanax</i>
<i>to make him calm.</i>

483
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:49,128
<i>Once he was gone,</i>

484
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:53,599
I realized
that I was frozen in amber, too.

485
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:58,437
Decades with my father went by
like 20 minutes.

486
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:00,339
I forgot everything.

487
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:02,341
Felt nothing.

488
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,411
But a lot of things happened
in the world around me

489
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:06,845
in those years.

490
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:08,180
The Internet.

491
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:09,715
Goddamn Hulu.

492
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:10,949
My old movies

493
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,851
streaming for free.

494
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,453
For free?

495
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:18,147
Folks started to recognize me
again on the street.

496
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:21,193
I started remembering.

497
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:23,261
All of it.

498
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:26,798
What I had, what had
been taken from me,

499
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,567
and what she had done to me.

500
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:31,336
My daddy's body died,

501
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,106
but the strength I took from
his breath stayed with me.

502
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:41,012
And I am going to use all of it
to ruin that woman.

503
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:47,719
To revenge.

504
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,793
To revenge.

505
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:07,887
What are you doing?

506
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,891
Remember me, Max?

507
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:14,127
I'm Dr. Lowe.

508
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:16,062
Last time we saw each other
was at the hospital.

509
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:18,397
You were dying from measles.

510
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,198
I saved you
by giving you my blood.

511
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:23,201
Cool. Thanks.
Who are these other kids?

512
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:24,804
They're from my class.

513
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,305
They drank my blood.

514
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:27,807
Now we're all alike.

515
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:29,909
Are you really a doctor?

516
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,110
We don't feel good.

517
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:33,579
Don't be stupid.

518
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:34,947
You don't need a doctor.

519
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:36,415
You have to drink the blood.

520
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,050
That's how you get better.

521
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:39,985
He's a fresh one, Madeline.

522
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,987
Not like the homeless guy.

523
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:43,489
He tastes good.

524
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:45,523
You killed the homeless man?

525
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:47,426
It's all over the news.

526
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,028
You can't keep doing this.
The police are gonna find you.

527
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:51,663
I told you guys.

528
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:53,631
This is wrong.

529
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,267
I don't want to kill anymore.

530
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:57,936
They made me kill my parents.

531
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,301
Duh!

532
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:02,441
We ate all our parents; that's
why nobody's looking for us.

533
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:04,076
I miss my mom.

534
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,543
Madeline,

535
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:06,911
it's been, like, four days.

536
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:09,547
Your spots are coming back.
You have to drink.

537
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:11,950
All of you.

538
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:18,322
No.

539
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:21,960
You're burning up.

540
00:31:21,994 --> 00:31:24,796
Listen, we should just off them.

541
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,464
All the sickies.

542
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:27,866
The only reason they're alive is

543
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,300
because you have
a crush on Madeline.

544
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,768
Shut up, Jimmy.

545
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:32,604
Dude, don't use my real name.

546
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:34,271
Now she knows who I am!

547
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,541
Pretty soon, everybody's
gonna know who you are.

548
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,476
You killed
the pizza delivery guy.

549
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:40,043
In about 30 minutes,
they're gonna know

550
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:42,045
he went missing.
They have your address.

551
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,981
The cops are gonna come
right here to the house.

552
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:46,349
Come with me, all of you,
to the Hotel Cortez.

553
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:48,251
There are people there like us.

554
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:50,687
- They'll know how to fix this.
- Right.

555
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:54,124
'Cause that's what we need--
adults telling us what to do.

556
00:31:54,158 --> 00:31:56,192
Screw that.

557
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:57,961
Listen, we have half an hour.

558
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,763
We can get out of here.

559
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:02,465
It's just... what about her?

560
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,971
You made the rule, Max.

561
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,038
Nobody leaves us alive.

562
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,972
No!

563
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,142
She made us.

564
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:14,944
She can leave.

565
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:16,479
Come with me to the hotel.

566
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:17,680
I said leave!

567
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:18,848
I can help you!

568
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,883
Fine. We're leaving.

569
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:22,218
You explain it to the cops.

570
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:39,068
She's still out.

571
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:41,771
She probably won't
feel anything.

572
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:43,906
That's too bad.

573
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,942
My only regret

574
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:47,877
is that she won't know
what's coming

575
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,879
and who's giving it to her.

576
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:52,081
What are you gonna do?

577
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:54,035
I'm gonna stab her
in the heart, and then

578
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:55,818
cut off her head.

579
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:58,054
Make sure she stays dead.

580
00:32:58,088 --> 00:33:00,556
What do you want me to do?

581
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:02,257
Watch.

582
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:06,528
See how someone with cojones
finishes the job.

583
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:21,076
Ballsy enough for you?

584
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,445
<i>Donovan,</i>
<i>I don't understand this.</i>

585
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,714
We're using her as bait?

586
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:29,050
Did she agree to this?

587
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:30,885
Is this plan "B"?

588
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,088
There is no plan "B."

589
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:35,657
Well, then what are we doing?

590
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:38,141
What are all these cameras for?

591
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:42,897
We are collecting our enemies
and putting them in here.

592
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:46,935
We're gonna hate-watch.

593
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:49,638
Our enemies?

594
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:52,741
You mean her enemies, don't you?

595
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:55,610
Her enemies <i>are</i> my enemies.

596
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:57,746
Aw, shit.

597
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,280
God, Donovan.

598
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:01,716
She loves me, Iris.

599
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:03,284
And I never stopped loving her.

600
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:05,986
Anyone who's against us
is gonna end up in here,

601
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:07,921
so just keep that in mind.

602
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:10,658
There is no us with that bitch.

603
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:14,061
It's just her and surviving

604
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,563
until she decides it's
time for you to die!

605
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,899
The three of us, together--

606
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:22,069
it's the only chance
we have to destroy her.

607
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:25,773
Did you really think the three
of us could ever be partners?

608
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:27,507
Well, then why did you save me?

609
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:30,010
I was weak.

610
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,845
I should have let you die.

611
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:36,616
No.

612
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:39,418
You're the one
who's gonna die, son.

613
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,555
You should listen to your mama.

614
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,490
She's right.

615
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:46,192
Shut up.

616
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:48,061
Shut up!

617
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,996
Go.

618
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,665
You think
you're her one and only?

619
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,100
That's what you think?

620
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,235
She's already moved on

621
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,604
to the next one;
you can count on it.

622
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,272
You don't know that,

623
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,607
then you're more dumb

624
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,743
than you are pretty.

625
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:08,319
And you are <i>very</i> pretty.

626
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:13,552
<i>It is a world</i>
<i>I no longer recognize</i>

627
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:17,523
and which no longer
recognizes me.

628
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:20,359
Anonymity is your friend.

629
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:22,461
To survive, we must be cunning

630
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,463
and stick to the shadows.

631
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,733
Natacha does not
see it that way.

632
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,635
She has been drawn in
by the future.

633
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,738
This modern world speaks to her.

634
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:34,139
I haven't even seen her

635
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,174
since you gave her
that black plastic card.

636
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:40,346
She speaks of nothing
but shopping and... Uber.

637
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,249
She's costing me a fortune.

638
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:45,751
But it's worth it, I'll admit.

639
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:48,720
I did it so I could
have you all to myself.

640
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,588
But I thought you loved Natacha.

641
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:52,338
I loved her because you did.

642
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,329
And because I was young and
lacking in self-confidence.

643
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,366
I thought I wasn't
woman enough for you.

644
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,635
Bellissima...

645
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:06,304
you are woman enough
for the both of us.

646
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:10,675
When I look at you, I see
something of my vanished world.

647
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:13,411
We can have that world again.

648
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:14,913
No.

649
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:18,250
It is lost.

650
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:20,184
There is no place for
enchantment anymore.

651
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:21,619
We can make a place.

652
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:23,788
We can create one.

653
00:36:23,822 --> 00:36:25,590
God knows I've been trying

654
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:27,892
to recreate you
for the last century.

655
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:32,196
A series of pale imitations,
gone, or soon to be.

656
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,632
I don't understand.

657
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,368
I've been clearing
the way for us.

658
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:41,872
We are so close to recapturing
what we once lost.

659
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:44,208
I'm about to come into
a great deal of money.

660
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:47,178
We can use it to turn the Cortez

661
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:50,147
into a fortress
against the modern world.

662
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:53,016
A world I hate
even more than you.

663
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,718
And what of Natacha?

664
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:58,922
If something were
to happen to her...

665
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:01,291
could you go on?

666
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:04,494
I would have you to comfort me.

667
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,401
Little Mouse!

668
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:13,437
You were so right.

669
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:16,573
It's astounding what's become
of dusty Beverly Hills.

670
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:19,409
Shops, shops and more shops.

671
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,510
Rudy, you won't believe
what I found.

672
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:24,180
A store with your name on it--
"Valentino."

673
00:37:24,215 --> 00:37:25,781
Hmm.

674
00:37:25,816 --> 00:37:27,516
Retail's all well and good,
but for the true couture,

675
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:28,985
you have to come to my place.

676
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,653
Are you mad?

677
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,421
I'm never stepping foot
in the Cortez again.

678
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:33,823
James March is long dead.

679
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:35,524
You're perfectly safe.

680
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,828
I'll have a car come
pick you up later.

681
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:43,632
Oh, and, Rudy,
you're not invited.

682
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,801
It's just us girls tonight.

683
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:11,009
Anyone present knows any reason why

684
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:14,118
this man and this woman should
not be joined in marriage,

685
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:16,487
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

686
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:18,489
Uh... yeah.

687
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:20,724
Because she's a bitch

688
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,704
with no conscience, no mercy,

689
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:24,386
no soul.

690
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:26,479
Oh, Liz.

691
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,832
Ignore her. She drinks.

692
00:38:28,866 --> 00:38:30,617
But the law requires a witness.

693
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:31,912
And I've witnessed plenty.

694
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:33,604
Please proceed.

695
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:35,671
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

696
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:37,072
You may kiss the bride.

697
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:43,712
My men, my family.

698
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:47,129
I am so happy to finally be
Mrs. Will Drake.

699
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:50,019
Dad, can I go upstairs now?

700
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:51,287
Of course you may.

701
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:53,389
And I am going to go upstairs

702
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:55,824
and change out of this
beautiful gown you've made me

703
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,760
and put on my traveling clothes.

704
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,262
You sure you don't want to have
a drink to celebrate first?

705
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,179
That's what
the honeymoon is for.

706
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:05,900
I'd like to get that started.
Well, I think I'm going to.

707
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:09,003
Your wife finds no reason
to object, and you own the bar.

708
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:10,238
Ah.

709
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,518
My darling Liz.

710
00:39:23,553 --> 00:39:25,619
These are for you,

711
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:30,391
with my genuine hope that
you someday find true love.

712
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:32,626
One never knows
when it may appear.

713
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:45,105
♪ One man on a lonely platform

714
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:49,310

717
00:39:56,184 --> 00:40:00,086
Ah, yes! A toast
to the guide of Cortez.

718
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,075
Or as some folks called her,
the bride of Cortez.

719
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,110
March is the name.
Longtime resident.

720
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:06,612
Call me James.

721
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:08,280
Mind if I join you?

722
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:11,183
I understand, uh,
congratulations are in order.

723
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:12,852
They are indeed, James.

724
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:14,854
Let's toast
to your good fortune, hmm?

725
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:17,056
I wouldn't suppose
you have an Armagnac?

726
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,826
I, uh, suspect you do.

727
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:25,331
Ah.

728
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,103
Here's to new worlds to conquer.

729
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,638
I will drink to that.

730
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,609
Ah, yes.

731
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,413
We are led by the women
in our lives, are we not?

732
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:42,614
You know The Countess?

733
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,816
Acquainted, yes.
I never thought

734
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:46,785
I was the marrying kind,

735
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,355
and now I get to call
that woman my wife.

736
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:57,596
Felicitations
to the happy couple.

737
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,364
I must commend you.

738
00:40:59,398 --> 00:41:02,266
A blended family
is terribly progressive.

739
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:03,535
I'm very lucky.

740
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:05,103
She loves my son very much.

741
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:08,239
I, uh...

742
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:11,175
wasn't referring to your son.

743
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,879
♪ Ah, we fade to grey.

744
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,117
Initially, I had my doubts

745
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,652
the child was of my
own flesh and blood.

746
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:25,189
You see, he doesn't bear any of
the distinctive March features.

747
00:41:25,224 --> 00:41:27,958
Diamond jaw,
strong, piercing eyes.

748
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:30,628
A flair for the dramatic.

749
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,196
He has quite a
delicate temperament,

750
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:33,531
as you'll get to know.

751
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:37,904
Except when he's feeding.

752
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:39,937
In that regard,
he most certainly

753
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:41,305
takes after his mother.

754
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,541
Holy shit!
What the hell is that thing?

755
00:41:43,575 --> 00:41:44,975
And to think,

756
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,678
I was prepared
to love and raise <i>your</i> son.

757
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:49,847
What is going on?

758
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:52,316
What is this-- some,
some sort of prank?

759
00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:54,519
That thing can't be yours.

760
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,663
It doesn't even look human.

761
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,522
I thought to kill you in Paris,

762
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,991
but I could never stomach
traveling with someone

763
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:05,462
who said such hateful things
about my child.

764
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,839
I am going to make sure
you suffer, immensely.

765
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,348
Hey.

766
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:28,919
Hey.

767
00:42:28,954 --> 00:42:30,420
Are you okay?

768
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:33,190
Where the hell are we?
Who are you?

769
00:42:33,224 --> 00:42:35,525
One of her victims.

770
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,061
Just like you.

771
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:42,332
Uh, this... this is insane.

772
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:44,234
This can't be real.

773
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:47,770
You're about to find out
just how real it is,

774
00:42:47,805 --> 00:42:49,439
when they come back down here

775
00:42:49,474 --> 00:42:51,908
and stick you in that other one.

776
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:56,246
Please...
get me out of this.

777
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,215
Please!

778
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:03,352
There's a handle in the back.

779
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:05,387
Yeah.

780
00:43:05,422 --> 00:43:07,423
Oh.

781
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:12,061
Oh!

782
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:19,435
All right.

783
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,904
- All right, it's gonna be okay.
- Oh.

784
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:24,439
There's got to be
a way out of here.

785
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:37,418
Hello?!

786
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:39,454
Is anybody there?!

787
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:45,426
Help!

788
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:48,764
Let us out of here!

789
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,600
Help!

790
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:54,069
Jesus, I think it's soundproof.

791
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:57,105
No one even knows we're here.

792
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,940
We'll starve.

793
00:43:58,975 --> 00:44:00,908
I won't.

794
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:20,161
Help me.

795
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:22,229
Please.
