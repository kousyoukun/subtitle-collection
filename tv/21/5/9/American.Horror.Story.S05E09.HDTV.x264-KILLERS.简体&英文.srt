00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,260
二逼大会在希尔顿酒店召开
douche bag convention is over at the Hilton.

171
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,150
我们有预定
We have a reservation.

172
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,890
用我的名字  斯特姆考克预定的
Under my name, Stormcock.

173
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
好吧
Okay.

174
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,510
那是...
Would that be a...

175
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,430
姓氏  还是全名  像麦当娜那样
Last name or the whole thing, like Madonna?

176
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,150
你有没有查到预约登记
Do you have the reservation or not?

177
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,890
就在这里
It's right here.

178
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,480
那么
So, uh,

179
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,410
你们打算在上面做什么
what are you guys planning on doing up there?

180
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,800
就是一般那些
Oh, nothing unusual.

181
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,710
异性性爱  口交
Straight sex, blow job.

182
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,980
我可能会舔她菊花
I'll probably rim her.

183
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,690
你休想把舌头伸进我菊花里
You're not sticking your tongue in my ass.

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,040
没什么比装逼的色情片女星更烦人的了
Nothing like a prude porn star.

185
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,700
等你们入住了
I'll bring up some extra towels

186
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,100
我会多送去几条毛巾
after you've settled in.

187
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,570
谢谢
Thank you.

188
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,260
我对黄片没什么意见
I've got nothing against pornography

189
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,200
如果拍得好的话
when it's done right.

190
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,940
我像其他人一样
I went and saw deep throat

191
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,860
去圣塔莫尼卡大道的皇家剧院
at the royal on Santa Monica Boulevard,

192
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,470
看了《深喉》
just like everybody else.

193
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,820
就连威廉·巴克利都去看了
Hell, even William Buckley went.

194
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,820
{\an3}媒体人  作家
保守主义政治评论家

195
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,970
那是真正的演员拍的
That was shot with real actors,

196
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,170
在片场拍摄  有剧本
on sets, with a script.

197
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
如今  随便两个什么人都能拿个iPhone
Nowadays any couple of yahoos can take out their iphones

198
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,790
假装是色情片大导演
and pretend to be the Sydney Pollack of sex flicks.

199
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,830
因为互联网
And because of that world wide web,

200
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,720
他们还能大挣一笔
they can actually make a buck off of it.

201
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,880
他们很多人都来科泰兹旅馆
And plenty of them are picking the Hotel Cortez

202
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,860
制作他们的糟糕作品
to make their mess-terpieces.

203
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,680
过去  我承认  我还推波助澜
In the past, I'll admit it, I was an enabler.

204
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,540
我拿他们的钱  给他们把钥匙
I'd take the money and hand them a key

205
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,230
不去想楼上发生的事
and try not to think about what was happening upstairs.

206
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,880
但自从我转化后  我无法不去想
But ever since I was converted, I can't turn away.

207
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,200
我不想不去想
I don't want to.

208
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,690
这是个新的我
It's a new me.

209
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,930
我成了个女霸王
I'm becoming a goddamn Dirty Harriet.

210
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,290
黄片对人有伤害
Porn hurts people.

211
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,640
伤害那些以为自己也得那么上床的女孩
Hurts the girls who think they need to screw like that.

212
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,590
伤害那些以为女孩喜欢那样上床的男人
Hurts the guys who think girls want to screw like that.

213
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,650
我并不是刻板
I'm not uptight,

214
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,530
我只是不希望这种事再在我的旅馆里发生
I just don't want it going on in my hotel anymore.

215
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,060
多诺万会喜欢他坚强的新母亲的
Donovan will like his strong new mother.

216
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,250
我如今简直是全世界母亲的榜样了
Hell, I'm an example for mothers everywhere now.

217
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,570
我就说你太吵了
I told you you were being too loud.

218
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,750
我假装的时候总是喊得很响
I'm always loud when I'm faking it.

219
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,020
怎么回事
What the hell?

220
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,350
二逼
Douche bag.

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,120
天呐
Oh, god. ‭

222
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,860
求你  我不想死
Please, I don't want to die.

223
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,180
我不想
I don't want to...

224
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,480
你好  艾芮斯
Hello, Iris.

225
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,080
多诺  你怎么来了
Dono, what are you doing here?

226
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,310
我听说了你几周前
I mean, I heard what you did

227
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,750
对那些潮人做的事
to those hipsters a couple weeks ago,

228
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,990
还有你准备杀了女伯爵的孩子
about how you were ready to off the countess' kids,

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,560
但我以为那是谣传呢
but I thought it was just tall tales.

230
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,550
但你显然是变威风了
But you have Clearly come into your own.

231
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,000
都因为你
'cause of you.

232
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,590
听我说
But listen,

233
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,960
你在这儿不安全
it's not safe for you here.

234
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,510
出问题了
There's been a problem.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,390
有人把巴塞洛缪放出去了
Someone let Bartholomew out of his room.

236
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,440
该死
Shit.

237
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,170
我差点失去了他
I nearly lost him.

238
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,950
我要知道究竟是谁干的
I demand to know who's responsible.

239
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,670
不是我啊
Well, wasn't me.

240
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,000
你要保护的那条性命
Is the life you're protecting

241
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,070
值得你为之送命吗
really worth losing your own?

242
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,710
或是你儿子的命
Or your son's?

243
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,400
多诺万跟那事无关
Donovan had nothing to do with it.

244
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,940
是拉蒙娜·罗耶尔
It was Ramona Royale.

245
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,310
我担心她会发现
I'm worried that she's gonna put it together

246
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,330
我们三个是串通好的
that the three of us are in cahoots.

247
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,780
我们需要B计划
We need a plan "B."

248
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,230
我早想好了
I'm way ahead of you.

249
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,980
女伯爵以为我又跟她和好了
The countess thinks I'm back with her.

250
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,950
这就是我来的原因
That's why I'm here.

251
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,500
她没有钩住你吧
Tell me she doesn't have her hooks in you.

252
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,530
没有  母亲
Not at all, mother.

253
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,890
听我说
Look...

254
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,950
淡定  低调
Just sit tight, keep quiet.

255
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,940
你知道的越少越好
The less you know, the better.

256
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,510
等我需要你时  我会告诉你的
And when I need you, I'll let you know.

257
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,630
有人吗  谁能报警
Hey, hello? Can somebody call the police?

258
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,230
不要
No, no...

259
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,570
我们太性感了  伙计
We are hot shit, buddy.

260
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,370
你居然要娶女人
I can't believe you're marrying a girl.

261
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,930
我就直说了
I'm gonna be blunt.

262
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,920
你父亲是双性恋
Your father is bisexual.

263
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,380
人们觉得那个词很肮脏
People think that word means something dirty,

264
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,530
但并不是的
but it doesn't.

265
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,450
意思是  我既喜欢男人也喜欢女人
It means I like men and I like women.

266
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,410
一样喜欢
Equally.

267
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,520
人们不理解
People don't understand,

268
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,220
就把我视为怪人
so they treat me like I'm weird.

269
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,490
或者像是我有所隐瞒
Or like I'm trying to hide something.

270
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,250
-或者...  -你只喜欢男人
- or that... - That you only like guys?

271
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,510
是啊  差不多
Yeah, something like that.

272
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,690
如果你走运
And if you're lucky,

273
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,140
你这辈子
once in your life

274
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,320
能碰上那么一个真正理解你的人
you find somebody who really understands you.

275
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,290
我本来没想到我能碰到那样的人
And I didn't think someone like that existed for me.

276
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,400
直到我遇到女伯爵
Until I met the Countess.

277
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,800
她就是真命天女
She's the one.

278
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,540
等你遇见了你的真命天女
And when you meet the one,

279
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,000
一定要把握好她
you hold on tight

280
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,890
不要放弃
and you never let go.

281
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,420
别娶她
Don't marry her.

282
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,720
她并不合适你
She's not the one for you.

283
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,100
不适合任何男人
For any man. ‭

284
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,010
抱歉  你是谁  你怎么进来的
Excuse me, who are you? How did you get in here?

285
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,070
那是爱弗斯女士  她在这儿工作
That's Ms. Evers. She works here. ‭

286
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,090
要我给你一把刀吗  德雷克先生
Would you like me to bring you a knife, Mr. Drake?

287
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,480
或许一把手枪
Perhaps a pistol?

288
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,840
还是你是那种
Or are you the type who would prefer

289
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,610
更喜欢跳楼的人
to hurl yourself out a window?

290
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,350
什么
Excuse me?

291
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,860
你显然是想自寻短见
Well, clearly you want to commit suicide.

292
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,870
否则你为什么会愿
Why else would you agree

293
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,300
娶那个毒妇
to marry that poisonous leech of a woman?

294
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,440
你太过分了
You are way out of line.

295
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,650
你如果娶女伯爵  你必死无疑
If you marry the Countess you will die.

296
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,490
你的儿子大概也会死
And your boy, too, probably.

297
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,600
快滚出去
Get the hell out of here.

298
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,830
你必须相信我  先生
You must believe me, sir.

299
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,320
一旦她把戒指带在你手上  就会吸干你的血
Once she puts the ring on your finger she will bleed you dry.

300
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,120
婚前协议可以保护我
I have a prenup to protect me from that.

301
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,860
快滚出去  你被解雇了
Get the hell out of here. You're fired.

302
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,810
我本来该结婚的
I was supposed to be married.

303
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,040
我爱他
I loved him.

304
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,290
但他选择去爱她
But he chose to love her instead.

305
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,400
我父亲总说要娶一个
My father always said to marry

306
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,610
朴素的女人  会少很多麻烦
a homely woman. Less trouble.

307
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,680
我不同意
I disagree.

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,910
我喜欢你  我依赖你
I adore you. I depend on you.

309
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,210
看我穿得这身西装
Look at the suit I'm wearing.

310
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,020
原本上面沾满了胆汁
It was covered in bile, literal bile,

311
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,950
我那天在卧铺车上捅死的男人身上的胆汁
from a pullman I knifed the other day.

312
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,080
而现在就好像从没脏过一样
It's like nothing was ever there.

313
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,660
你真是个天才
You're a genius.

314
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,290
但女伯爵就是上帝的完美产物
But the Countess is a creature from heaven.

315
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,040
时髦
Style,

316
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,530
优雅  美丽
grace, beauty.

317
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,360
你们有着不同的优点
It's not your fault you were graced with...

318
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,480
这不是你的错
different gifts.

319
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,210
每人会从她手底下逃脱
No one survives her.

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,480
请你离开
Please leave.

321
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,080
我再也不想在旅馆里见到你
I never want to see you in this hotel again.

322
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,390
不信算了
So be it.

323
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,150
那天很快就会到来
One day, very soon,

324
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,800
你会明白的
you will understand.

325
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,470
你只会收获痛苦
You will know nothing but pain, hmm?

326
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,740
而我会在那里等你
And I will be there.

327
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,960
你会向我寻求帮助和慈悲
And you will reach out to me for help and mercy,

328
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,860
那时我会面带笑容看着你死去
and in return I will watch you die with a smile on my face,

329
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,790
因为我知道等你一死
because I will know that once you are gone

330
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,720
我就有机会清理你身上穿得那套正装
I will get the chance to clean the blood and shit

331
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,870
上面的血渍和屎尿
out of that pretty formal wear of yours.

332
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,130
我只想证实一下  因为好像
I just wanted to confirm ‭everything because it looks like

333
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,910
有人想打开这面墙
someone just tried to open up this wall.

334
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,330
是的  而我告诉你现在关上它
Yes, and I'm telling you now to close it.

335
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,230
有了这扇防盗门  我就会把这间小屋
With a security door. I'm turning this entire wing

336
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,190
变成德雷克先生珍藏品的秘密储藏室
into a secure archive for Mr. Drake's previous collections.

337
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,740
它必须牢不可破
It needs to be impenetrable.

338
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,740
当然了  是为了安全考虑
For insurance purposes, of course.

339
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,540
如果我们先问过主人的意见会更好一些
I'd feel more comfortable if we checked with the owner first.

340
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,020
我们不要让他知道
We won't say anything to him.

341
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,990
这是个惊喜  是结婚礼物
It's a surprise. A wedding gift.

342
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,330
好日子是什么时候
When's the happy day?

343
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,820
希望明天前一切都能完工
I expect this all to be done by tomorrow.

344
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,960
可这要花上至少一周时间来整理这些东西
I mean, it's gonna take at least a week to order these parts.

345
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,500
你有一打吸顶式网络摄像头
You got a dozen ceiling-mounted IP cameras,

346
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,890
-还有生物识别扫描  -我对细节没兴趣
- you got Biometric... - Details don't interest me, boo.

347
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,880
结果才是最重要的
Results are the only thing that matters.

348
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,670
你的要求根本无法完成
What you're asking is impossible.

349
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,370
"想要实现这些不可能
"In order to attain the impossible,

350
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,290
必须勇于大胆尝试"
one must attempt the absurd."

351
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,610
米格尔·德·塞万提斯
Miguel De Cervantes.

352
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,320
他是你的装潢师吗
Is this your decorator?

353
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,580
我是她的匿名合伙人
I'm the silent partner.

354
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,150
这位女士对装修有其独到的见解  不是吗
The lady has an eye for improvements, does she not?

355
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,260
如我之前解释的
Well, as I was explaining,

356
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,670
有很多东西要搬
there's a lot of moving parts.

357
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,000
你被这些无关紧要的东西遮蔽了双眼
You are clouding your mind with the inconsequential.

358
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,310
其实很简单
It's quite simple.

359
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,010
这是一面承重墙
This is a load-bearing wall.

360
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,210
它足可以承受你附加在上面的
Abundantly strong enough for just about

361
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,710
任何钢筋
any steel you lug up here.

362
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,330
然后  就只需要几个铆钉就搞定了
After that, it's just a matter of a few rivets.

363
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,320
这方面我有着丰富的经验
I have extensive experience on this.

364
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,750
带上你的工具和你的工人
Gather your materials and your men

365
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,630
我领你们进去
and I will guide you through it.

366
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,520
-我尽力吧  -这就对了嘛
- I'll do what I can. - That's the spirit!

367
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,860
快一点  有很多事要做呢
Make haste! Much to accomplish!

368
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,290
不用劳烦你那漂亮的小脑袋  亲爱的
Don't you worry your pretty head, dear.

369
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,490
我一定会让你得偿所愿的
I'll see to it you get what you want.

370
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,510
你是不是疯了
Are you out of your goddamn mind?!

371
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,600
如果你不是早死了  我一定杀了你
I'd kill you if you weren't dead already.

372
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,520
你真让我恶心
You disgust me.

373
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,550
你还在为那个外国佬的事而生气啊
You're still upset about the dago.

374
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,710
你搞砸了  吉米
You screwed up, Jimmy.

375
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,630
你抢走了我最心爱的东西
You robbed me of the thing I loved the most.

376
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,990
现在我永远都不想再看见
And now I never want to see your pathetic,

377
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,950
你那可怜又可悲的脸了
miserable face ever again.

378
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,170
但我们有约定的
But we have an arrangement.

379
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,150
求你
Please.

380
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,770
共进晚餐是我在地狱般的地方里唯一的慰藉
Our dinners are my sole comfort in this stygian heap.

381
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,870
明天前  密室必须要修好
The chamber must be completed by tomorrow.

382
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,670
你要是敢跑  我会立马杀了你
‭You try to run, I will kill you so fast.

383
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,860
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

384
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,870
有人教导我空手拜访客人是很无礼的
I was taught it was impolite to visit a friend empty-handed.

385
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,000
闭嘴
‭Shut up.

386
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,580
我知道你是哪种朋友了
I saw what kind of friend you were.

387
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,530
你是只可怕的娘们  多诺万
You're a scared little pussy, Donovan.

388
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,160
找不到你的种
Couldn't find your balls

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,530
因为它们被串成串挂在她的床柱上了
if they were dangling by a string on her bedpost.

390
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,750
我需要一个人帮我扳倒她  你永远不是
You could never be the kind of man I need to take her down.

391
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,890
你错了
You're wrong.

392
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,740
我有了新的动机
I've been newly motivated.

393
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,310
说说看
Tell me more.

394
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,240
我喜欢听被羞辱的故事
I love a good humiliation.

395
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,130
她又对你做了什么以前没做过的事了
What did she do to you that she hasn't already done?

396
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,770
她让我回去
She took me back.

397
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,790
是的
Yeah.

398
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,380
女伯爵说她错了
The Countess told me she made a mistake,

399
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,610
我才是她的最爱  永远的爱人
and I was the one. Forever.

400
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,190
我们像第一次时那样做爱
We made love like it was the first time.

401
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,540
但你并不相信她
But you didn't believe her.

402
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,240
我相信了
Oh, I did. I did.

403
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,510
我比之前更想拥有她
I wanted her even more than I did before.

404
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,020
因为我知道没有她的日子是什么样的
Because I knew what it felt like to live without her.

405
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,610
而那让我意识到
And that's-that's when I realized

406
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,760
我对她的渴望永远无法挥去
it was never going away-- my desperation for her.

407
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,650
有种永远无法满足的渴望
It's a horrible feeling to have a craving

408
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,300
真是太可怕了
that you could never satiate.

409
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,430
那是种瘾
It's an addiction.

410
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,380
我了解你的感受
I've been where you are.

411
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,840
让我想想我们该怎么做
Let me think about where we go from here.

412
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,690
不  必须今晚行动  她明天就要
No, it has to be tonight. She's getting married

413
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,900
嫁给威尔·德雷克了  她现在分心了
to Will Drake tomorrow. She's distracted.

414
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,790
而且我在她酒里放了
Also, I slipped enough GHB

415
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,920
足够可以放倒一头大象的迷魂药
into her drink to knock out an elephant.

416
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,600
这是个完美的机会
This is the perfect time.

417
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,900
你都安排好了
Oh, you got this all planned.

418
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,000
但...  我无法扣动扳机
But... I can't pull the trigger.

419
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,720
你知道的
You know that.

420
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,130
我欣赏那种
Well, I can appreciate a man

421
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,670
了解自己弱点的男人
who understands his own weakness.

422
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,820
成交吗
Do we have a deal?

423
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,420
来干一杯吧
Let's drink to it.

424
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,820
你知道我为什么想干掉女伯爵
You know why I want to take the Countess down.

425
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,330
你为何这么久还没有复仇
What took you so long to look for revenge, huh?

426
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,710
我怎么知道你可以信任
How do I know I can trust you?

427
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,670
没错
It's true.

428
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,320
20多年前她杀死了我的男人
She killed my man over 20 years ago

429
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,380
把我丢在一边
and tossed me aside.

430
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,820
你知道比心碎还糟的是什么
You know the only thing worse than heartbreak?

431
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,920
孤独
Loneliness.

432
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,980
知道一切永远不会结束
Knowing that it's never going to end.

433
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,860
我非常绝望
So in my despair,

434
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,790
去了世界上唯一一个
I went to the only place in the world

435
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,600
我很确定
where I knew for sure

436
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,680
有爱我的人的地方
there were people who loved me.

437
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,250
{\an8}洛杉矶  1992年

438
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,140
回到了这个世上
Back to the only man in the world

439
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,180
我唯一曾屈膝的男人身边
that I ever kneeled down for.

440
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,240
你好  爸爸
Hello, daddy.

441
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,440
孩子  我有十年没见过你了
Haven't seen you in ten years, child.

442
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,570
你做了那个整形手术吗
You been doing that plastic surgery?

443
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,440
你哭了  疼吗
You been crying. You hurt?

444
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,640
心里痛
Only on the inside.

445
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,020
真的很痛
Real bad.

446
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,470
我能进去吗
Can I come in?

447
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,890
求你了
Please?

448
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,560
我待了几个月
I stayed for a few months.

449
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,180
妈妈养育我的灵魂  爸爸纠正了我的错
Mama fed my soul, and daddy straightened me right out.

450
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,370
爸爸指导我看清这是什么  那是什么
My daddy pointed his finger at me and told me what was what,

451
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,940
我觉得自己又重新变成了一个小女孩
and I felt like a little girl again.

452
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
我安全了
Safe.

453
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,730
爸爸
Daddy.

454
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,330
爸爸
Daddy.

455
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:49,900
你没事吧
You all right?

456
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,210
我...
Oh, I...

457
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,620
忘记我说到哪里了
just lost my place there for a moment.

458
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,050
我们之前在说什么
What were we talking about?

459
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,430
亲爱的  这种事总是发生
Honey, it happens all the time now.

460
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,050
凯西  我的钥匙呢
"Cassie, where my keys?

461
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,900
凯西  今天几号
Cassie, what day is it?"

462
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,580
你去看看医生吧  爸爸
You talk to the doctor, daddy?

463
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,390
你妈妈才是病人
Your mama is the sick one.

464
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,040
家里只能有一个病人
Only room for one in the family.

465
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,060
爸爸  明天我开车送你去见萨米医生吧
Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.

466
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,640
我想去的话可以自己开车
I can drive myself if I want to go,

467
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,330
但我不想去
and I don't.

468
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,260
我没事
I'm fine.

469
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,510
好吧
Okay.

470
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,580
失去妈妈后  事情就变得更糟了
When we lost mama, things just got worse.

471
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,890
他们结婚60年了
For 60 years, they were married.

472
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,670
没有她  他就再也没有了
without her, his mind just couldn't find a reason

473
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,110
记忆的动力
to hang on.

474
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,370
他开始在自家的街区迷路
He started to get lost in his own neighborhood.

475
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,650
找不到他生活了40年的家
Couldn't find the house that he had lived in for 40 years.

476
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,720
爸爸
Daddy?

477
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,970
看到一个如此优秀的男人沦落至此
To see this great man laid so low.

478
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,560
没关系
It's okay.

479
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,920
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be fine.

480
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,000
我见过病毒的威力
I'd seen what the virus had done.

481
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,960
非常难以想象
Miraculous things.

482
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,260
割伤可以迅速愈合
Cuts healed.

483
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,180
骨折在几天内
Broken bones mended

484
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,400
就可以修复
in just a few days' time.

485
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,370
为什么不呢
So why not?

486
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,970
为什么不让它救回我的爸爸
Why couldn't it also bring my daddy back to me?

487
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,350
凯西
Cassie?

488
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,780
凯西  是你吗
Cassie, that you?

489
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,930
但神经并不是割伤
But neurons are not cuts,

490
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,820
生病的大脑也不是断了的骨头
and a diseased brain is not a broken bone.

491
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,710
病毒所做的
All the virus had done

492
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,420
是阻止阿兹海默症的加重
was stop the alzheimer's progression.

493
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,600
妈妈已经走了  爸爸
Mama's gone, daddy.

494
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,620
你知道的
You know that.

495
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,870
你是谁
Who are you?

496
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,570
是我呀  爸爸
It's me, daddy.

497
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,430
我是你的女儿
Your daughter.

498
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,730
他无法自己去找新鲜的血液
He was in no condition to hunt for himself

499
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,340
甚至也不明白他变成了什么样子
or to even understand what he had become.

500
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,200
所以我来照顾他
So I took care of him.

501
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,400
我杀人给他带血液回来
I brought him back blood from my kills.

502
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,680
我还抱着希望  他情况没有恶化
I held out hope that since he wasn't getting any worse,

503
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,440
或许会慢慢好起来
maybe he'd get better.

504
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,890
但他没有好起来
But he didn't get any better.

505
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,630
他一直如此
He just stayed the same.

506
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,840
我们都没有变
We both did.

507
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,080
就这样过了20年
For 20 years.

508
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,040
爸爸  爸爸
Daddy?! Daddy!

509
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,940
爸爸
Daddy.

510
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,210
我不忍心让他这样活着
I couldn't let him live like that,

511
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,620
像被包裹在琥珀里
frozen in amber.

512
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,900
所以我给他吃镇静剂让他平静
So I gave him a xanax to make him calm.

513
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,840
他去世以后
Once he was gone,

514
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,000
我才意识到原来自己也和他一样
I realized that I was frozen in amber, too.

515
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,910
和爸爸在一起的几十年就好像短短20分钟
Decades with my father went by like 20 minutes.

516
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,520
我忘记了一切
I forgot everything.

517
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,340
什么都感觉不到
Felt nothing.

518
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,370
但是这些年中
But a lot of things happened

519
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,020
周边的世界发生了很大的变化
in the world around me in those years.

520
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,110
互联网  该死的葫芦网
The internet. Goddamn hulu.

521
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,930
我以前拍的电影可以免费观看
My old movies streaming for free.

522
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,230
有没有搞错
For free?

523
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,520
又有人开始在街上认出我来
Folks started to recognize me again on the street.

524
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,220
我开始记起很多事
I started remembering.

525
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,550
所有
All of it.

526
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,100
我曾经拥有的  被夺走的
What I had, what had been taken from me,

527
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,320
她对我做的一切
and what she had done to me.

528
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,500
我父亲虽然死了
My daddy's body died,

529
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,200
但我从他身边汲取的能力依旧伴随着我
but the strength I took from his breath stayed with me.

530
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,790
我要用尽这一切
And I am going to use all of it

531
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,060
来毁掉她
to ruin that woman.

532
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,710
敬复仇
To revenge.

533
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,450
敬复仇
To revenge.

534
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,590
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

535
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,390
记得我吗  麦克斯
Remember me, Max?

536
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,760
我是劳医生
I'm Dr. Lowe.

537
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,600
我们上次在医院见过
Last time we saw each other was at the hospital.

538
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,300
你因麻疹而奄奄一息
You were dying from measles.

539
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,690
我给你输了血才救活你
I saved you by giving you my blood.

540
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,770
-太好了  谢谢  -这些孩子是谁
- Cool. Thanks. - Who are these other kids?

541
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,300
是我班上的
They're from my class.

542
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,840
都喝了我的血
They drank my blood.

543
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,590
现在我们是同类
Now we're all alike.

544
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,170
你真的是医生吗
Are you really a doctor?

545
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
我们不舒服
We don't feel good.

546
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,180
别傻了
Don't be stupid.

547
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,180
你不需要医生
You don't need a doctor.

548
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,440
你得喝血
You have to drink the blood.

549
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,990
这样你就会好一点
That's how you get better.

550
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,090
他是新鲜的  玛德琳
He's a fresh one, Madeline.

551
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,370
不像那些流浪汉一样
Not like the homeless guy.

552
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,270
他的血味道很好
He tastes good.

553
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,540
是你们杀死了那个流浪汉
You killed the homeless man?

554
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,960
新闻上都是的
It's all over the news.

555
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,380
你们不能再这样了  警察会发现你们的
You can't keep doing this. The police are gonna find you.

556
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,020
我告诉过你们了
I told you guys.

557
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,650
这样做不对
This is wrong.

558
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,850
我不想再杀人了
I don't want to kill anymore.

559
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,960
他们逼我杀了我爸妈
They made me kill my parents.

560
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,140
我们都把爸妈吃了
We ate all our parents.

561
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,860
所以才没有人来找我们
That's why nobody's looking for us.

562
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,410
我想妈妈了
I miss my mom.

563
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,900
玛德琳
Madeline,

564
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,680
已经四天了
it's been, like, four days.

565
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,360
你的疹子又出现了  你必须喝血
Your spots are coming back. You have to drink.

566
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,980
大家都是
All of you.

567
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,710
不
No.

568
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,430
你发烧了
You're burning up.

569
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,370
听着  就该甩掉他们
Listen, we should just off them.

570
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,900
这些得病的
All the sickies.

571
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,250
他们还活着的唯一原因
The only reason they're alive is

572
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,010
就是你喜欢玛德琳
because you have a crush on Madeline.

573
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,220
闭嘴  吉米
Shut up, Jimmy.

574
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,390
伙计  别叫我真名
Dude, don't use my real name.

575
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,680
现在她知道我的身份了
Now she knows who I am.

576
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,960
很快人人都会知道你是谁了
Pretty soon everybody's gonna know who you are.

577
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,000
你们杀了一个送披萨的
You killed the pizza delivery guy.

578
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,560
半小时之内人们就会发现他失踪了
In about 30 minutes, they're gonna know he went missing.

579
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,620
他们有你们的地址
They have your address.

580
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,590
警察会直奔此地的
The cops are gonna come right here to the house.

581
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,330
和我一起去科泰兹酒店吧
Come with me, all of you, to the Hotel Cortez.

582
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,950
那里有我们的同类
There are people there like us.

583
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,540
他们知道该如何处理
They'll know how to fix this.

584
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,730
对  大人对我们的指手画脚正是我们需要的
Right. Cause that's what we need-- adults telling us what to do.

585
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,680
见鬼去吧
Screw that.

586
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,800
听着  我们还有半小时的时间
Listen, we have half an hour.

587
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,090
我们可以离开
We can get out of here.

588
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,880
但  她呢
It's just... what about her?

589
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,550
规矩是你定的  麦克斯
You made the rule, Max.

590
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,610
没人可以活着离开我们
Nobody leaves us alive.

591
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,480
不
No!

592
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,220
是她造就的我们
She made us.

593
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,220
她可以离开
She can leave.

594
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,000
和我一起去旅馆吧
Come with me to the hotel.

595
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,200
我说了  走
I said leave!

596
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,370
我可以帮你们
I can help you!

597
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,550
好吧  我们走
Fine. We're leaving.

598
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,290
你去和警察解释吧
You explain it to the cops.

599
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,700
她还没醒
She's still out.

600
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,250
也许根本不会有感觉
She probably won't feel anything.

601
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,120
那太糟了
That's too bad.

602
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,960
我唯一的遗憾
My only regret

603
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,090
就是她根本不知道怎么死的
is that she won't know what's coming

604
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,380
也不知道是谁送她上的路
and who's giving it to her.

605
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,020
你要怎么做
What are you going to do?

606
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,490
我会一刀刺进她的心脏
I'm gonna stab her in the heart and then

607
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,070
再割下她的头
cut off her head.

608
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,620
保证她死得透透的
Make sure she stays dead.

609
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,280
那我要干什么
What do you want me to do?

610
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,340
看着就好
Watch.

611
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,630
看看有胆子的人是怎么把这事了了的
See how someone with cojones finishes the job.

612
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,700
够胆了吗
‭Ballsy enough for you?

613
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,540
多诺万  我不明白
Donovan, I don't understand this.

614
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,150
用她做诱饵吗
We're using her as bait?

615
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,560
她同意了吗
Did she agree to this?

616
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,370
这是备用计划吗
Is this plan "B"?

617
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,900
没有备用计划
There is no plan "B."

618
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,060
那我们要怎么做
Well, then, what are we doing?

619
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,090
这些摄像机是干什么的
What are all these cameras for?

620
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,370
我们把仇家都引过来  关到这里
We are collecting our enemies and putting them in here.

621
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,550
好好欣赏他们
We're gonna hate-watch.

622
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,100
我们的敌人
Our enemies?

623
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,510
你是说她的敌人吧
You mean her enemies, don't you?

624
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,630
她的敌人就是我的敌人
Her enemies are my enemies.

625
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,260
该死
Aw, shit.

626
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,460
天啊  多诺万
God, Donovan.

627
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,110
她爱我  艾芮斯
She loves me, Iris.

628
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,240
我也将永远爱她
And I never stopped loving her.

629
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,270
所有反对我们的人最后的下场就是这样
Anyone who's against us is gonna end up in here,

630
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,590
所以你还是别费口舌了
so just keep that in mind.

631
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,280
你和那贱人没有未来的
There is no us with that bitch.

632
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,100
她心里只有自己
It's just her and surviving

633
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,080
她想什么时候弄死你就什么时候弄死你
until she decides it's time for you to die!

634
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,750
我们三人联手
The three of us, together--

635
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,700
是打败她的唯一办法
it's the only chance we have to destroy her.

636
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,440
你真以为我们三个是搭档吗
Did you really think the three of us could ever be partners?

637
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,140
那你为什么要救我
Well, then, why did you save me?

638
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,420
我心软了
I was weak.

639
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,360
就该让你死掉的
I should have let you die.

640
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,820
不
No.

641
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,020
会死的是你  孩子
You're the one who's gonna die, son.

642
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,170
你该听妈妈的话
You should listen to your mama.

643
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,260
她说得没错
She's right.

644
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,550
闭嘴
Shut up.

645
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,580
给我闭嘴
Shut up!

646
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,050
走吧
Go.

647
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,040
你以为自己是她的唯一吗
You think you're her one and only?

648
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,710
你就是这么想的吧  她早已抛下你
That's what you think? She has already moved on

649
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,970
另寻新欢了  绝对的
to the next one; you can count on it.

650
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,610
如果你还不明白
You don't know that,

651
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,300
那你更是一个蠢到家的小白脸了
then you're more dumb than you are pretty.

652
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,390
不过你还真是帅
And you are very pretty.

653
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,940
我已经不了解这个世界了
It is a world I no longer recognize

654
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,950
这个世界也已经不认识我了
and which no longer recognizes me.

655
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,400
不为人所知是福分  亲爱的
Anonymity is your friend, my love.

656
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,130
为了生存  我们必须谨慎
To survive, we must be cunning

657
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,720
更要隐姓埋名
and stick to the shadows.

658
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,670
娜塔莎不这么认为
Natacha does not see it that way.

659
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,100
她为未来世界迷住了
She has been drawn in by the future.

660
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,260
这个现代社会蛊惑了她
This modern world speaks to her.

661
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,290
你给了她那张黑色的
I haven't even seen her

662
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,720
塑料卡片后  我还没有见过她
since you gave her that black plastic card.

663
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,380
她嘴里就只有购物和打车软件了
She speaks of nothing but shopping and... Uber.

664
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,470
她花了我好多钱
She's costing me a fortune.

665
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,430
但也是值得的
But it's worth it, I'll admit.

666
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,370
这样一来  我就能和你独处了
I did it so I could have you all to myself.

667
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,010
我以为你是爱娜塔莎的
But I thought you loved Natacha.

668
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,800
我爱她是因为你爱她
I loved her because you did.

669
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,190
也因为当年我还年少  缺乏自信
And because I was young and lacking in self-confidence.

670
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,740
我以为对你来说  我还不够女人
I thought I wasn't woman enough for you.

671
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,070
小美人
Bellissima...

672
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,010
在我们俩眼中  你都足够女人味
you are woman enough for the both of us.

673
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,180
从你眼中我能看到逝去世界的一些东西
When I look at you, I see something of my vanished world.

674
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,350
你可以重新拥有那个世界
We can have that world again.

675
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,300
不
No.

676
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,370
已经不存在了
It is lost.

677
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,570
这个世界已经容不下魔法了
There is no place for enchantment anymore.

678
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,970
我们可以建造一片净土
We can make a place.

679
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,420
重新创造一个
We can create one.

680
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,100
过去的一百年里
God knows I've been trying

681
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,480
我一直在努力重造你
to recreate you for the last century.

682
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,650
那些苍白的复制品来了又去  马上就不存在了
A series of pale imitations, gone, or soon to be.

683
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,850
我不明白
I don't understand.

684
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,800
我在为我们清理道路
I've been clearing the way for us.

685
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,360
我们很快就能重新拥有曾经失去的了
We are so close to recapturing what we once lost.

686
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,850
我很快就能继承到一大笔钱
I'm about to come into a great deal of money.

687
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,130
我们可以用这笔钱把科泰兹
We can use it to turn the Cortez

688
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,570
打造成一个对抗现代社会的堡垒
into a fortress against the modern world.

689
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,520
我比你还讨厌现在这个世界
A world I hate even more than you.

690
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,330
那娜塔莎呢
And what of Natacha?

691
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,870
如果她出了什么意外
If something were to happen to her...

692
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,800
你还活得下去吗
could you go on?

693
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,850
还有你来慰藉我的心
I would have you to comfort me.

694
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,530
小老鼠
Little mouse!

695
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,930
你说得一点没错
You were so right.

696
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,480
脏兮兮的贝弗利山现在太绚丽了
It's astounding what's become of dusty Beverly Hills.

697
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,170
商店一家连一家
Shops, shops and more shops.

698
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,990
鲁迪  你不会相信我看到了什么
Rudy, you won't believe what I found.

699
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,560
以你命名的商店  瓦伦蒂诺[华伦天奴]
A store with your name on it-- "Valentino."

700
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,450
零售店都还是不错的  不过真正的好衣服嘛
Retail's all well and good, but for the true couture,

701
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,760
还得去我那儿
you have to come to my place.

702
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,950
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

703
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,550
我永远都不会再踏进科泰兹了
I'm never stepping foot in the Cortez again.

704
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,260
詹姆斯·马奇已经死了  你们绝对安全
James March is long dead. You're perfectly safe.

705
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,330
我一会儿派车来接你们
I'll have a car come pick you up later.

706
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,170
鲁迪  你没被邀请呢
Oh, and, Rudy, you're not invited.

707
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,880
今晚是女生之夜
It's just us girls tonight.

708
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,410
如果在场有任何人
If anyone present knows any reason

709
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,440
有反对这对男女结为夫妻的理由
why this man and this woman should not be joined in marriage,

710
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,960
请现在说出  此后将永不得再说
speak now or forever hold your peace.

711
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,280
我有话
Yeah.

712
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,260
因为她是个贱人
Because she's a bitch

713
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,410
没有良心和慈悲心
with no conscience, no mercy,

714
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,580
更没有灵魂
no soul.

715
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,780
丽兹
Oh, Liz.

716
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,290
别理她  她喝多了
Ignore her. She drinks.

717
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,350
但法律要求有见证人
But the law requires a witness.

718
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,600
我看得够多的了
And I've witnessed plenty.

719
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,810
请继续吧
Please proceed.

720
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,420
现在我宣布你们正式结为夫妻
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

721
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,940
你可以亲吻新娘了
You may kiss the bride.

722
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,040
我的丈夫  我的家
My men, my family.

723
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,970
终于成为威尔·德雷克夫人  我太高兴了
I am so happy to finally be Mrs. Will Drake.

724
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,710
爸爸  我能上楼去了吗
Dad, can I go upstairs now?

725
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,960
当然可以  我也要上楼
Of course you may, and I am going to go upstairs

726
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,730
脱下你为我设计的这身漂亮的礼服
and change out of this beautiful gown you've made me

727
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,900
换一身旅行装
and put on my traveling clothes.

728
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,170
确定不用先喝一杯庆祝一下吗
You sure you don't want to have a drink to celebrate first?

729
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,960
蜜月就是为了庆祝啊
That's what the honeymoon is for.

730
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,700
我希望马上就开始
I'd like to get that started.

731
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,480
好吧  那我得先来一杯
All right, well, I think I'm going to.

732
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,680
夫人我找不到发对的理由  吧台是你的了
Your wife finds no reason to object, and you own the bar.

733
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,470
亲爱的丽兹
My darling Liz,

734
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,090
这是给你的
these are for you

735
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,690
我真心希望有一天你能找到真爱
With my genuine hope that you someday find true love.

736
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,130
谁也不知道真爱之人何时会出现
One never knows when it may appear.

737
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,990
对  敬科泰兹的领袖
Ah, yes! A toast to the guide of Cortez.

738
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,790
也有人称她为  科泰兹的新娘
Or as some folks called her, the bride of Cortez.

739
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,070
我姓马奇  常住人士
March is the name. Longtime resident.

740
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,500
叫我詹姆斯就好
Call me James.

741
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,980
能一起吗
Mind if I join you?

742
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,960
我想你一定是有喜事要庆祝吧
I understand, uh, congratulations are in order.

743
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,760
确实如此  詹姆斯
They are indeed, James.

744
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,710
为你的好运干一杯如何
Let's toast to your good fortune, hmm?

745
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,660
你这儿有雅邑白兰地吗
I wouldn't suppose you have an armagnac?

746
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,950
我猜你有吧
I, uh, suspect you do.

747
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,670
敬将去征服的新世界
Here's to new worlds to conquer.

748
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,410
干杯
I will drink to that.

749
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,530
好
Ah, yes.

750
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,940
我们都被生命中的女人所牵引  是不是
We are led by the women in our lives, are we not?

751
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,110
你认识女伯爵
You know the Countess?

752
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,570
算是熟人吧
Acquainted, yes.

753
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,650
我从没想过我会结婚
I never thought I was the marrying kind,

754
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,300
现在我得叫那个女人妻子了
and now I get to call that woman my wife.

755
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,960
恭喜你们这对新人啊
Felicitations to the happy couple.

756
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,390
我真得夸夸你
I must commend you.

757
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,090
混合家庭绝对是开明之举
A blended family is terribly progressive.

758
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,840
我很幸运  她爱我的儿子
I'm very lucky. She loves my son very much.

759
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,220
我...
I, uh...

760
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,970
说的不是你儿子
wasn't referring to your son.

761
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,010
一开始我怀疑
Initially, I had my doubts

762
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,230
那孩子是我的亲骨肉
the child was of my own flesh and blood.

763
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,180
但他并没有遗传到马奇家的任何特性
You see, he doesn't bear any of the distinctive March features.

764
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,680
完美的下巴  坚韧而富有穿透力的眼睛
Diamond jaw, strong, piercing eyes.

765
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,470
戏剧性的天赋
A flair for the dramatic.

766
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,360
他性格内敛
He has quite a delicate temperament,

767
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,740
你马上就会看到了
as you'll get to know.

768
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,250
除了他喝奶的时候
Except when he's feeding.

769
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,100
从那一点看  他绝对遗传了他母亲
In that regard, he most certainly takes after his mother.

770
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,800
见鬼
‭Holy shit!

771
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,980
那是什么东西
What the hell is that thing?

772
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,570
想想看  我会好好爱你儿子  抚养他长大的
And to think, I was prepared to love and raise your son.

773
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,380
这是怎么回事
What is going on?

774
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,340
这是什么  恶作剧吗
What is this-- some, some sort of prank?

775
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,020
那东西不可能是你儿子
That thing can't be yours.

776
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,560
他都不像是人类
It doesn't even look human!

777
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,930
我本想在巴黎把你杀了的
I thought to kill you in Paris,

778
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,850
但我无法忍受和一个
but I could never stomach traveling with someone

779
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:50,350
这样说我孩子坏话的男人一起出行的
who said such hateful things about my child.

780
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,860
我一定会让你
I am going to make sure you suffer

781
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,270
生不如死
immensely.

782
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,460
你没事吧
Are you okay?

783
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,000
我们这是在哪儿  你是谁
Where the hell are we? Who are you?

784
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,510
她的受害者之一
One of her victims.

785
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,140
和你一样
Just like you.

786
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,230
这一定是疯了
This... this is insane.

787
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,490
不是真的
This can't be real.

788
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,570
你马上就会知道有多真实了
You're about to find out just how real it is,

789
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,550
等他们回到这儿
when they come back down here

790
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,070
把你钉上到那上面
and stick you in that other one.

791
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,340
求你了  救我出去
Please... get me out of this.

792
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,050
求你了
Please!

793
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,250
后面有一个把手
There's a handle in the back.

794
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,210
找到了
Yeah.

795
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,990
好了
All right.

796
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,950
好了  不会有事的
All right, it's gonna be okay. ‭

797
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,210
一定有办法出去的
There's got to be a way out of here.

798
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,290
有人吗
Hello?!

799
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,580
有人吗
Is anybody there?!

800
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,590
救命
Help!

801
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,900
放我们出去
Let us out of here!

802
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,540
救命
Help!

803
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,610
天啊  我觉得是隔音的
Jesus, I think it's soundproof.

804
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,270
没人知道我们在这儿
No one even knows we're here.

805
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,540
我们会饿死的
We'll starve.

806
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,770
我不会
I won't.
