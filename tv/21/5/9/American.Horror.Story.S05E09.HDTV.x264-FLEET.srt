Wow.

I heard what you did

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,343
to those hipsters
a couple weeks ago,

212
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:56,044
about how you were ready

213
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,413
to off The Countess's kids,
but I thought

214
00:11:58,447 --> 00:11:59,814
it was just tall tales.

Is the life you're protecting

226
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,606

231

247
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:31,629

249
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:36,333
Your father is bisexual.

250
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:38,869

means something dirty,

251
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,403
but it doesn't.

252
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,740
It means I like men and
I like women, equally.

253
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,944
People don't understand,
so they treat me like I'm weird.

254
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,946
Or like I'm trying
to hide something.

255
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,548
Or that...
That you only like guys?

256
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,417
Yeah, something like that.

257
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,453

258
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,289
And if you're lucky,

259
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:01,524
once in your life,

260
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,494
you find somebody
who really understands you.

261
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,932
And I didn't think someone
like that existed for me.

262
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,734

264
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:13,804
She's the one.

265
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,173
And when you meet the one,

266
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,276
you hold on tight
and you never let go.

267
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,378
Don't marry her.

268
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,081
She's not the one for you.

269
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,349
- For any man.
- Excuse me, who are you?

270
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,685
- How did you get in here?
- That's Ms. Evers.

271
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,953
- She works here.
- Would you like me

272
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:33,455
to bring you a
knife, Mr. Drake?

273
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,390
Perhaps a pistol?

274
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:37,093
Or are you the type
who would prefer

275
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,794
to hurl yourself out a window?

276
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,830
Excuse me?
Well, clearly you want to

277
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,098
commit suicide.

278
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,899
Why else would you agree

279
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:46,468
to marry that poisonous
leech of a woman?

280
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,137
You are way out of line.

281
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:51,507
If you marry The Countess,
you will die.

282
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,807
And your boy, too, probably.

283
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:53,926
Get the hell out of here.

284
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:56,377
You must believe me, sir.
Once she puts the ring

285
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,513
on your finger,
she will bleed you dry.

286
00:14:58,547 --> 00:14:59,914
I have a prenup
to protect me from that.

287
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,516
Get the hell out of here.

288
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,885
You're fired.
I was supposed to be married!

289
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,620
I loved him.

290
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,857
But he chose
to love her instead.

291
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,860
My father always said to marry

292
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,594
a homely woman.

293
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,397
Less trouble.

294
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:18,399
I disagree.

295
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,002
I adore you.
I depend on you.

296
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:22,637
Look at the suit I'm wearing.

297
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,405
It was covered in bile,
literal bile,

298
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,407
from a pullman
I knifed the other day.

299

You're a genius.

302
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:36,016
But The Countess
is a creature from heaven.

303
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,651
Style,

304
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,954
grace, beauty.

305
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:44,692
It's not your fault
you were graced with...

306
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:47,327
different gifts.

307
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,330
No one survives her.

308
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:51,832
Please leave.

309
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:54,201
I never want to see you
in this hotel again.

310
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,536
So be it.

311
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,240
One day,

312
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:03,310
very soon, you will understand.

313
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:06,613
You will know nothing
but pain, hmm?

314
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,181
And I will be there.

315
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,251
And you will reach out to me
for help and mercy,

316
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:15,088
and in return, I will watch you
die with a smile on my face,

317
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:18,157
because I will know
that once you are gone,

318
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:20,993
I will get the chance
to clean the blood and shit

319
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:24,231
out of that pretty
formal wear of yours.

320
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:29,001
(door opens, closes)

321
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:32,505
I just wanted to confirm
everything because it looks like

322
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,241
someone just tried
to open up this wall.

323
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,710
Yes, and I'm telling you now
to close it.

324
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:38,345
With a security door.

325
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:41,214
I'm turning this entire wing
into a secure archive

326

for Mr. Drake's
previous collections.

327
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,652
It needs to be impenetrable.

328
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:49,421
For insurance
purposes, of course.

329
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:52,125
I'd feel more comfortable if
we checked with the owner first.

330
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,360
We won't say anything to him.

331
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,195
It's a surprise.
A wedding gift.

332
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,830
When's the happy day?

333
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,166
I expect this all to
be done by tomorrow.

334
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,901
(chuckles) It's gonna
take at least a week

335
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,202
to order these parts.

336
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:05,171
You got a dozen
ceiling-mounted

337
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,039
I.P. cameras,
you got biometric...

338
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,142
The details
don't interest me, boo.

339
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:11,410
Results are the only thing
that matters.

340
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,578
What you're asking
is impossible.

341
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:14,480
MARCH: "In order
to attain the impossible,

342
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:16,149
one must attempt
the absurd."

343
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,652
Miguel de Cervantes.

344
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,654
Is this your decorator?

345
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:23,555
I'm the silent partner.

346
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,358
The lady has an eye
for improvements, does she not?

347
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,793
Well, as I was explaining,

348
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,461
there's a lot of moving parts.

349
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,363
You are clouding your mind
with the inconsequential.

350
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:32,531
It's quite simple.

351
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,301
This is a load-bearing wall.

352
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:36,302
Abundantly strong enough
for just about

353
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,903
any steel you lug up here.

354
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,738
After that, it's just a matter
of a few rivets.

355
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:41,407
I have extensive
experience on this.

356
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:42,874
Gather your materials
and your men,

357
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,443
and I will guide you through it.

358
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,144
I'll do what I can.

359
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,746
Yes, that's the spirit!

360
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,915
Make haste!
Much to accomplish!

361
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,487
Don't worry
your pretty head, dear.

362
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,489
I'll see to it
you get what you want.

363
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:00,958
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?!

364
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,861
I'd kill you if you
weren't dead already.

365
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,797
You disgust me.

366
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:09,266
You're still upset
about the dago.

367
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,935
You screwed up, Jimmy.

368
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,638
You robbed me of the
thing I loved the most.

369
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,873
And now I never want
to see your pathetic,

370
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,042
miserable face ever again.

371
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:20,244
But we have an arrangement!

372
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:21,709
Please.

373
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:24,882
Our dinners are my sole
comfort in this stygian heap.

374
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,985
The chamber must be completed
by tomorrow.

375
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:35,893
(grunting)
You try to run, I will kill you so fast.

376
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,697
(knocking)

377
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:42,967
What the hell?

378
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,769
I was taught it was impolite
to visit a friend empty-handed.

379
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:47,271
(grunts)
Shut up.

380
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,840
I saw what kind
of friend you were.

381
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,943
Oh. You're a scared
little pussy, Donovan.

382
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,246
Couldn't find your balls

383
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,381
if they were dangling
by a string on her bedpost.

384
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,918
You could never be the kind
of man I need to take her down.

385
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,486
You're wrong.

386
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:08,892
I've been newly motivated.

387
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,828
Tell me more.

388
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,365
I love a good humiliation.

389
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,534
What did she do to you
that she hasn't already done?

390
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:20,136
She took me back.

391
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,393
Yeah.

392
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:24,874
The Countess told me
she made a mistake,

393
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,642
and I was the one.

394
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,191
Forever.

395
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,480
We made love
like it was the first time.

396
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,181
But you didn't believe her.

397
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:34,850
(chuckles)

398
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:35,885
Oh, I did.

399
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,387
(chuckles) I did.

400
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,926
I wanted her even more
than I did before.

401
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,494
Because I knew what it felt like
to live without her.

402
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:47,996
And that's-that's
when I realized

403
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:51,833
it was never going away--
my desperation for her.

404
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,036
It is a horrible feeling
to have a craving

405
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,603
that you can never satiate.

406
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,105
It's an addiction.

407
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,774
I've been where you are.

408
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,947
Let me think
about where we go from here.

409
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,126
No, it has to be tonight.

410
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,050
She's getting married
to Will Drake tomorrow.

411
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,018
She's distracted.

412
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,054
Also, I slipped enough GHB

413
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,888
into her drink
to knock out an elephant.

414
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,890
This is the perfect time.

415
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:20,094
Oh, you got this all planned.

416
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:26,233
But... I can't pull the trigger.

417
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,269
You know that.

418
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:32,606
Well, I can appreciate a man

419
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,142
who understands
his own weakness.

420
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,483
Do we have a deal?

421
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:45,285
(groans)

422
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,921
Let's drink to it.

423
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:05,605
You know why I want
to take The Countess down.

424
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,440
What took you so long
to look for revenge, huh?

425
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,678
How do I know I can trust you?

426
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,916
It's true.

427
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,520
She killed my man
over 20 years ago

428
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:22,822
and tossed me aside.

429
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,224
You know the only thing
worse than heartbreak?

430
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:28,727
Loneliness.

431
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:31,763
Knowing that
it's never going to end.

432
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:37,669
So, in my despair,

433
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:40,071
I went to the only place
in the world

434
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:44,342
where I knew for sure
there were people who loved me.

435
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,283
<i>Back to the only man</i>
<i>in the world</i>

436
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:57,283
<i>that I ever kneeled down for.</i>

437
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:18,469
Hello, Daddy.

438
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:22,773
Haven't seen you
in ten years, child.

439
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:24,928
You been doing
that plastic surgery?

440
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:26,449
Mm-mm.

441
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:27,450
You been crying.

442
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:28,451
You hurt?

443
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,065
Only on the inside.

444
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:32,254
Real bad.

445
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,256
Can I come in?

446
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,692
Please?

447
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:39,028

448

Daddy.

455
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:58,814
You all right?

456
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:00,248
Oh, I...

457
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:01,984
just lost my place there
for a moment.

458
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,251
What were we talking about?

459
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:04,987
(laughs)

460
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,756
Honey, it happens
all the time now.

461
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,991
"Cassie, where my keys?

462
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:11,426
Cassie, what day is it?"

463
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,695
You talk to the doctor, Daddy?

464
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,464
Huh?
Your mama is the sick one.

465
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,901
Only room for one in the family.

466
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,507
Daddy, let me drive you over
to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.

467
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,475
I can drive myself

468
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,877

469
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:32,346

<i>what the virus had done.</i>

489
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,075
<i>Miraculous things.</i>

490
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,777
<i>Cuts healed.</i>

491
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,714
<i>Broken bones mended</i>
<i>in just a few days' time.</i>

492
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,316
<i>So why not?</i>

493
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,586
<i>Why couldn't it also</i>
<i>bring my daddy back to me?</i>

494
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,022
(sucking)

495
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,160
(exhales)

496
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,961
MAN (over TV): The forecast,
showers and thunderstorms today.

497
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:34,097
(door opens, closes)

498
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,100
Cassie?

499
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,336
Cassie, that you?

500
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,604
RAMONA:
<i>But neurons are not cuts,</i>

501
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:45,475
<i>and a diseased brain</i>
<i>is not a broken bone.</i>

502
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,678
<i>All the virus had done</i>

503
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,714
<i>was stop</i>
<i>the Alzheimer's progression.</i>

504
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:55,351
Mama's gone, Daddy.

505
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,754
You know that.

506
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:01,725
Who are you?

507
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,728
It's me, Daddy.

508
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,997
Your daughter.

509
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:13,435
<i>He was in no condition</i>
<i>to hunt for himself</i>

510
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:17,873
<i>or to even understand</i>
<i>what he had become.</i>

511
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:20,209
<i>So I took care of him.</i>

512
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:23,145
<i>I brought him back blood</i>
<i>from my kills.</i>

513
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,548
<i>I held out hope that since</i>
<i>he wasn't getting any worse,</i>

514
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,818
<i>maybe he'd get better.</i>

515
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:30,651
<i>But he didn't get any better.</i>

516
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:32,220
<i>He just stayed the same.</i>

517
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:33,988
<i>We both did.</i>

518
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,825
<i>For 20 years.</i>

519
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:43,031
(glass shatters)
Daddy?! Daddy!

520
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:47,802
Daddy.

521
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:50,238
(TV playing quietly)

522
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,123
<i>I couldn't let him live</i>
<i>like that,</i>

523
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:11,792
<i>frozen in amber.</i>

524
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:15,829
<i>So I gave him a Xanax</i>
<i>to make him calm.</i>

525
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:21,501
(sobs softly)

526
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:23,536
(water sloshing gently)

527
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:37,984
(sobs)

528
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:42,922
(crying)

529
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:49,128
<i>Once he was gone,</i>

530
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:53,599
I realized
that I was frozen in amber, too.

531
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:58,437
Decades with my father went by
like 20 minutes.

532
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:00,339
I forgot everything.

533
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:02,341
Felt nothing.

534
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,411
But a lot of things happened
in the world around me

535
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:06,845
in those years.

536
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:08,180
The Internet.

537
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:09,715
Goddamn Hulu.

538
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:10,949
My old movies

539
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,851
streaming for free.

540
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,453
For free?

541
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:18,147
Folks started to recognize me
again on the street.

542
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:21,193
I started remembering.

543
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:23,261
All of it.

544
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:26,798
What I had, what had
been taken from me,

545
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,567
and what she had done to me.

546
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:31,336
My daddy's body died,

547
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,106
but the strength I took from
his breath stayed with me.

548
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:41,012
And I am going to use all of it
to ruin that woman.

549
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:47,719
To revenge.

550
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:54,325
(sighs)

551
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,793
To revenge.

552
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:07,887
What are you doing?

553
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,891
Remember me, Max?

554
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:14,127
I'm Dr. Lowe.

555
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:16,062
Last time we saw each other
was at the hospital.

556
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:18,397
You were dying from measles.

557
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,198
I saved you
by giving you my blood.

558
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:23,201
Cool. Thanks.
Who are these other kids?

559
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:24,804
MAX:
They're from my class.

560
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,305
They drank my blood.

561
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:27,807
Now we're all alike.

562
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:29,909
GIRL:
Are you really a doctor?

563
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,110
We don't feel good.

564
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:33,579
Don't be stupid.

565
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:34,947
You don't need a doctor.

566
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:36,415
You have to drink the blood.

567
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,050
That's how you get better.

568
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:39,985
He's a fresh one, Madeline.

569
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,987
Not like the homeless guy.

570
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:43,489
He tastes good.

571
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:45,523
ALEX:
You killed the homeless man?

572
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:47,426
It's all over the news.

573
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,028
You can't keep doing this.
The police are gonna find you.

574
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:51,663
I told you guys.

575
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:53,631
This is wrong.

576
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,267
I don't want to kill anymore.

577
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:57,936
They made me kill my parents.

578
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,301
JIMMY:
Duh!

579
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:02,441
We ate all our parents; that's
why nobody's looking for us.

580
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:04,076
I miss my mom.

581
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,543
MAX:
Madeline,

582
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:06,911
it's been, like, four days.

583
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:09,547
Your spots are coming back.
You have to drink.

584
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:11,950
All of you.

585
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:18,322
No.

586
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:21,960
You're burning up.

587
00:31:21,994 --> 00:31:24,796
Listen, we should just off them.

588
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,464
All the sickies.

589
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:27,866
The only reason they're alive is

590
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,300
because you have
a crush on Madeline.

591
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,768
Shut up, Jimmy.

592
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:32,604
Dude, don't use my real name.

593
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:34,271
Now she knows who I am!

594
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,541
Pretty soon, everybody's
gonna know who you are.

595
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,476
You killed
the pizza delivery guy.

596
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:40,043
In about 30 minutes,
they're gonna know

597
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:42,045
he went missing.
They have your address.

598
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,981
The cops are gonna come
right here to the house.

599
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:46,349
Come with me, all of you,
to the Hotel Cortez.

600
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:48,251
There are people there like us.

601
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:50,687
They'll know how to fix this.
MAX: Right.

602
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:54,124
'Cause that's what we need--
adults telling us what to do.

603
00:31:54,158 --> 00:31:56,192
Screw that.

604
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:57,961
Listen, we have half an hour.

605
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,763
We can get out of here.

606
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:02,465
It's just... what about her?

607
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,466
(metallic swish)

608
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,971
You made the rule, Max.

609
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,038
Nobody leaves us alive.

610
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,972
No!

611
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,142
She made us.

612
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:14,944
She can leave.

613
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:16,479
Come with me to the hotel.

614
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:17,680
I said leave!

615
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:18,848
I can help you!

616
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,883
Fine. We're leaving.

617
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:22,218
You explain it to the cops.

618
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:33,896
(door creaks)

619
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:39,068
She's still out.

620
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:41,771
She probably won't
feel anything.

621
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:43,906
That's too bad.

622
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,942
My only regret

623
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:47,877
is that she won't know
what's coming

624
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,879
and who's giving it to her.

625
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:52,081
What are you gonna do?

626
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:54,035
RAMONA: I'm gonna stab her
in the heart, and then

627
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:55,818
cut off her head.

628
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:58,054
Make sure she stays dead.

629
00:32:58,088 --> 00:33:00,556
What do you want me to do?

630
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:02,257
Watch.

631
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:06,528
See how someone with cojones
finishes the job.

632
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:16,771
(hissing)

633
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:18,907
(Ramona gasps)

634
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:21,076
(groans)
Ballsy enough for you?

635
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,445
IRIS: <i>Donovan,</i>
<i>I don't understand this.</i>

636
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,714
We're using her as bait?

637
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:29,050
Did she agree to this?

638
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:30,885
Is this plan "B"?

639
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,088
There is no plan "B."

640
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:35,657
Well, then what are we doing?

641
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:38,141
What are all these cameras for?

642
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:42,897
We are collecting our enemies
and putting them in here.

643
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:44,398
(chuckles)

644
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:46,935
We're gonna hate-watch.

645
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:49,638
Our enemies?

646
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:52,741
You mean her enemies, don't you?

647
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:55,610
Her enemies <i>are</i> my enemies.

648
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:57,746
Aw, shit.

649
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,280
God, Donovan.

650
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:01,716
She loves me, Iris.

651
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:03,284
And I never stopped loving her.

652
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:05,986
Anyone who's against us
is gonna end up in here,

653
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:07,921
so just keep that in mind.

654
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:10,658
There is no us with that bitch.

655
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:14,061
It's just her and surviving

656
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,563
until she decides it's
time for you to die!

657
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,899
The three of us, together--

658
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:22,069
it's the only chance
we have to destroy her.

659
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:25,773
Did you really think the three
of us could ever be partners?

660
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:27,507
Well, then why did you save me?

661
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:30,010
I was weak.

662
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,845
I should have let you die.

663
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,715
(sighs)

664
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:36,616
No.

665
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:39,418
You're the one
who's gonna die, son.

666
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,555
You should listen to your mama.

667
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,490
She's right.

668
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:46,192
Shut up.

669
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:48,061
Shut up!

670
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,996
Go.

671
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,665
You think
you're her one and only?

672
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,100
That's what you think?

673
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,235
She's already moved on

674
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,604
to the next one;
you can count on it.

675
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,272
You don't know that,

676
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,607
then you're more dumb

677
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,743
than you are pretty.

678
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:08,319
And you are <i>very</i> pretty.

679
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:13,552
VALENTINO: <i>It is a world</i>
<i>I no longer recognize</i>

680
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:17,523
and which no longer
recognizes me.

681
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:20,359
Anonymity is your friend.

682
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:22,461
To survive, we must be cunning

683
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,463
and stick to the shadows.

684
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,733
Natacha does not
see it that way.

685
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,635
She has been drawn in
by the future.

686
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,738
This modern world speaks to her.

687
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:34,139
I haven't even seen her

688
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,174
since you gave her
that black plastic card.

689
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:40,346
She speaks of nothing
but shopping and... Uber.

690
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,249
She's costing me a fortune.

691
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:45,751
But it's worth it, I'll admit.

692
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:48,720
I did it so I could
have you all to myself.

693
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,588
But I thought you loved Natacha.

694
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:52,338
I loved her because you did.

695
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,329
And because I was young and
lacking in self-confidence.

696
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,366
I thought I wasn't
woman enough for you.

697
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,635
Bellissima...

698
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:06,304
you are woman enough
for the both of us.

699
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:10,675
When I look at you, I see
something of my vanished world.

700
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:13,411
We can have that world again.

701
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:14,913
No.

702
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:18,250
It is lost.

703
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:20,184
There is no place for
enchantment anymore.

704
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:21,619
We can make a place.

705
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:23,788
We can create one.

706
00:36:23,822 --> 00:36:25,590
God knows I've been trying

707
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:27,892
to recreate you
for the last century.

708
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:32,196
A series of pale imitations,
gone, or soon to be.

709
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,632
I don't understand.

710
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,368
I've been clearing
the way for us.

711
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:41,872
We are so close to recapturing
what we once lost.

712
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:44,208
I'm about to come into
a great deal of money.

713
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:47,178
We can use it to turn the Cortez

714
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:50,147
into a fortress
against the modern world.

715
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:53,016
A world I hate
even more than you.

716
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,718
And what of Natacha?

717
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:58,922
If something were
to happen to her...

718
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:01,291
could you go on?

719
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:04,494
I would have you to comfort me.

720
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:09,299
(door opens)

721
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,401
Little Mouse!

722
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:13,437
You were so right.

723
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:16,573
It's astounding what's become
of dusty Beverly Hills.

724
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:19,409
Shops, shops and more shops.

725
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,510
Rudy, you won't believe
what I found.

726
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:24,180
A store with your name on it--
"Valentino."

727
00:37:24,215 --> 00:37:25,781
Hmm.

728
00:37:25,816 --> 00:37:27,516
Retail's all well and good,
but for the true couture,

729
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:28,985
you have to come to my place.

730
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,653
Are you mad?

731
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,421
I'm never stepping foot
in the Cortez again.

732
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:33,823
James March is long dead.

733
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:35,524
You're perfectly safe.

734
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,828
I'll have a car come
pick you up later.

735
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:43,632
Oh, and, Rudy,
you're not invited.

736
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,801
It's just us girls tonight.

737
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:47,236
(chuckles)

738
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:52,007
(door opens, closes)

739
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:11,009
Anyone present knows any reason why

740
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:14,118
this man and this woman should
not be joined in marriage,

741
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:16,487
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

742
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:18,489
Uh... yeah.

743
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:20,724
Because she's a bitch

744
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,704
with no conscience, no mercy,

745
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:24,386
no soul.

746
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:26,479
(chuckles):
Oh, Liz.

747
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,832
Ignore her. She drinks.

748
00:38:28,866 --> 00:38:30,617
But the law requires a witness.

749
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:31,912
And I've witnessed plenty.

750
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:33,604
Please proceed.

751
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:35,671
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

752
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:37,072
You may kiss the bride.

753
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,974
(both laugh)

754
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:43,712
My men, my family.

755
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:47,129
I am so happy to finally be
Mrs. Will Drake.

756
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:50,019
Dad, can I go upstairs now?

757
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:51,287
Of course you may.

758
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:53,389
And I am going to go upstairs

759
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:55,824
and change out of this
beautiful gown you've made me

760
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,760
and put on my traveling clothes.

761
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,262
You sure you don't want to have
a drink to celebrate first?

762
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,179
That's what
the honeymoon is for.

763
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:05,900
I'd like to get that started.
Well, I think I'm going to.

764
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:09,003
Your wife finds no reason
to object, and you own the bar.

765
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:10,238
Ah.

766
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,518
My darling Liz.

767
00:39:23,553 --> 00:39:25,619
These are for you,

768
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:30,391
with my genuine hope that
you someday find true love.

769

Ah.

786

Here's to new worlds to conquer.

787
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,638

Acquainted, yes.
I never thought

792
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:46,785
I was the marrying kind,

793
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,355

that woman my wife.

the child was of my

00:41:43,575 --> 00:41:44,975
COUNTESS:
And to think,

817
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,678
I was prepared
to love and raise <i>your</i> son.

818
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:49,847
What is going on?

819
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:52,316
What is this-- some,
some sort of prank?

820
00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:54,519
That thing can't be yours.

821
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,663
It doesn't even look human.

822
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,522
I thought to kill you in Paris,

823
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,991
but I could never stomach
traveling with someone

824
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:05,462
who said such hateful things
about my child.

825
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,839
I am going to make sure
you suffer, immensely.

826
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,806
(chuckles softly)

827
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,348
RAMONA:
Hey.

828
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:28,919
Hey.

829
00:42:28,954 --> 00:42:30,420
Are you okay?

830
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:33,190
Where the hell are we?
Who are you?

831
00:42:33,224 --> 00:42:35,525
One of her victims.

832
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,893
(groans)

833
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,061
Just like you.

834
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:39,829
(groans)

835
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:42,332
Uh, this... this is insane.

836
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:44,234
This can't be real.

837
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:47,770
You're about to find out
just how real it is,

838
00:42:47,805 --> 00:42:49,439
when they come back down here

839
00:42:49,474 --> 00:42:51,908
and stick you in that other one.

840
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:56,246
Please...
get me out of this.

841
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,215
Please!

842
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:00,984
(panting)

843
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:03,352
There's a handle in the back.

844
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:05,387
Yeah.

845
00:43:05,422 --> 00:43:07,423
(groans):
Oh.

846
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:12,061
(metallic creaking)
Oh!

847
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:14,097
(panting)

848
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:19,435
All right.

849
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,904
- All right, it's gonna be okay.
- Oh.

850
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:24,439
There's got to be
a way out of here.

851
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:27,009
(sighs)

852
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:37,418
Hello?!

853
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:39,454
Is anybody there?!

854
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:45,426
Help!

855
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:48,764
Let us out of here!

856
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,600
Help!

857
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:54,069
Jesus, I think it's soundproof.

858
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:57,105
No one even knows we're here.

859
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,940
We'll starve.

860
00:43:58,975 --> 00:44:00,908
I won't.

861
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,913
(gurgling)

862
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:09,183
(Ramona yelling, Will groaning)

863
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:20,161
(sobs):
Help me.

864
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:22,229
Please.

865
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:24,198
(grunting, gurgling)
