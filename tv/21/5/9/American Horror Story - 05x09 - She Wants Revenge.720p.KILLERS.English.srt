about how you were ready

to off The Countess's kids,

it was just tall tales.

but it doesn't.

253
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:35,207
It means I like men and
I like women, equally.

254
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:38,411
People don't understand,
so they treat me like I'm weird.

255
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:40,413
Or like I'm trying
to hide something.

256
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:43,015
Or that...
That you only like guys?

257
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,884

260
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,991
once in your life,

261
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:55,961
you find somebody
who really understands you.

262
00:13:57,697 --> 00:14:00,399
And I didn't think someone
like that existed for me.

00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,201

She's the one.

266
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:08,640
And when you meet the one,

267
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:12,743
you hold on tight
and you never let go.

268
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,845
Don't marry her.

269
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,548
She's not the one for you.

270
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,816
- For any man.
- Excuse me, who are you?

271
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,152

- That's Ms. Evers.

272
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,420
- She works here.
- Would you like me

273
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,922
to bring you a
knife, Mr. Drake?

274
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:26,857
Perhaps a pistol?

275
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:28,560
Or are you the type
who would prefer

276
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:30,261
to hurl yourself out a window?

277
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:32,297
Excuse me?
Well, clearly you want to

278
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,565
commit suicide.

279
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,366
Why else would you agree

280
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:37,935
to marry that poisonous
leech of a woman?

281
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,604
You are way out of line.

282

If you marry The Countess,
you will die.

283

And your boy, too, probably.

284

Get the hell out of here.

285
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:47,844
You must believe me, sir.
Once she puts the ring

286
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:49,980
on your finger,
she will bleed you dry.

287
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,381
I have a prenup
to protect me from that.

288
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,983
Get the hell out of here.

289
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,352
You're fired.
I was supposed to be married!

290
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,087
I loved him.

291
00:14:57,122 --> 00:15:00,324
But he chose
to love her instead.

292
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,327
My father always said to marry

293
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,061
a homely woman.

294
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:07,864
Less trouble.

295
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:09,866
I disagree.

296
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,469

297
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:14,104

298
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:15,872

literal bile,

299
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:17,874

I knifed the other day.

But The Countess
is a creature from heaven.

304

Style,

305

grace, beauty.

306
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:36,159
It's not your fault

307
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:38,794
different gifts.

308
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:41,797

309
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:43,299
Please leave.

310
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,668
I never want to see you
in this hotel again.

311
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:48,003
So be it.

312
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,707
One day,

313
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:54,777
very soon, you will understand.

314
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:58,080
You will know nothing
but pain, hmm?

315
00:15:58,114 --> 00:15:59,648
And I will be there.

316
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:02,718
And you will reach out to me
for help and mercy,

317
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:06,555
and in return, I will watch you
die with a smile on my face,

318
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,624
because I will know
that once you are gone,

319
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:12,460
I will get the chance
to clean the blood and shit

320
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:15,698
out of that pretty
formal wear of yours.

321
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:20,468
(door opens, closes)

322
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,972
I just wanted to confirm
everything because it looks like

323
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,708
someone just tried
to open up this wall.

324
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:28,177
Yes, and I'm telling you now
to close it.

325
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:29,812
With a security door.

326
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:32,681
I'm turning this entire wing
into a secure archive

327
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:34,982
for Mr. Drake's
previous collections.

328
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:38,119
It needs to be impenetrable.

329
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:40,888
For insurance
purposes, of course.

330
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:43,592
I'd feel more comfortable if
we checked with the owner first.

331
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,827
We won't say anything to him.

332
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:47,662
It's a surprise.
A wedding gift.

333
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,297
When's the happy day?

334
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,633
I expect this all to
be done by tomorrow.

335
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,368
(chuckles) It's gonna
take at least a week

336
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:54,669
to order these parts.

337
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:56,638
You got a dozen
ceiling-mounted

338
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:58,506
I.P. cameras,
you got biometric...

339
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,609
The details
don't interest me, boo.

340
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,877
Results are the only thing
that matters.

341
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:04,045
What you're asking
is impossible.

342
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,947
MARCH: "In order
to attain the impossible,

343
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,616
one must attempt
the absurd."

344
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,119
Miguel de Cervantes.

345
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:13,121
Is this your decorator?

346
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,022
I'm the silent partner.

347
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:17,825
The lady has an eye
for improvements, does she not?

348
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,260
Well, as I was explaining,

349
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:20,928
there's a lot of moving parts.

350
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:22,830
You are clouding your mind
with the inconsequential.

351
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:23,998
It's quite simple.

352
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:26,768
This is a load-bearing wall.

353
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:27,769
Abundantly strong enough
for just about

354
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,370
any steel you lug up here.

355
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:31,205
After that, it's just a matter
of a few rivets.

356
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,874
I have extensive
experience on this.

357
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:34,341
Gather your materials
and your men,

358
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:35,910
and I will guide you through it.

359
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,611
I'll do what I can.

360
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,213
Yes, that's the spirit!

361
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:41,382
Make haste!
Much to accomplish!

362
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,954
Don't worry
your pretty head, dear.

363
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,956
I'll see to it
you get what you want.

364
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:52,425
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?!

365
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,328
I'd kill you if you
weren't dead already.

366
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:57,264
You disgust me.

367
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:00,733
You're still upset
about the dago.

368
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,402
You screwed up, Jimmy.

369
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:05,105
You robbed me of the
thing I loved the most.

370
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,340
And now I never want
to see your pathetic,

371
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:09,509
miserable face ever again.

372
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,711
But we have an arrangement!

373
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,176
Please.

374
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:16,349
Our dinners are my sole
comfort in this stygian heap.

375
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:19,452
The chamber must be completed
by tomorrow.

376
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:27,360
(grunting)
You try to run, I will kill you so fast.

377
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:32,164
(knocking)

378
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,434
What the hell?

379
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:37,236
I was taught it was impolite
to visit a friend empty-handed.

380
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,738
(grunts)
Shut up.

381
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:41,307
I saw what kind
of friend you were.

382
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:44,410
Oh. You're a scared
little pussy, Donovan.

383
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,713
Couldn't find your balls

384
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:49,848
if they were dangling
by a string on her bedpost.

385
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,385
You could never be the kind
of man I need to take her down.

386
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,953
You're wrong.

387
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,359
I've been newly motivated.

388
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:04,295
Tell me more.

389
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,832
I love a good humiliation.

390
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:10,001
What did she do to you
that she hasn't already done?

391
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:11,603
She took me back.

392
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:13,860
Yeah.

393
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,341
The Countess told me
she made a mistake,

394
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,109
and I was the one.

395
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,658
Forever.

396
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:22,947
We made love
like it was the first time.

397
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,648
But you didn't believe her.

398
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:26,317
(chuckles)

399
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:27,352
Oh, I did.

400
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,854
(chuckles) I did.

401
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:35,393
I wanted her even more
than I did before.

402
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:37,961
Because I knew what it felt like
to live without her.

403
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,463
And that's-that's
when I realized

404
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:43,300
it was never going away--
my desperation for her.

405
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,503
It is a horrible feeling
to have a craving

406
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:47,070
that you can never satiate.

407
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:48,572
It's an addiction.

408
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,241
I've been where you are.

409
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:56,414
Let me think
about where we go from here.

410
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:58,593
No, it has to be tonight.

411
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,517
She's getting married
to Will Drake tomorrow.

412
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:02,485
She's distracted.

413
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,521
Also, I slipped enough GHB

414
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,355
into her drink
to knock out an elephant.

415
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,357
This is the perfect time.

416
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:11,561
Oh, you got this all planned.

417
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:17,700
But... I can't pull the trigger.

418
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,736
You know that.

419
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:24,073
Well, I can appreciate a man

420
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:27,609
who understands
his own weakness.

421
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,950
Do we have a deal?

422
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:36,752
(groans)

423
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,388
Let's drink to it.

424
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:57,072
You know why I want
to take The Countess down.

425
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:59,907
What took you so long
to look for revenge, huh?

426
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,145
How do I know I can trust you?

427
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:08,383
It's true.

428
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,987
She killed my man
over 20 years ago

429
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,289
and tossed me aside.

430
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:17,691
You know the only thing
worse than heartbreak?

431
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,194
Loneliness.

432
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:23,230
Knowing that
it's never going to end.

433
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,136
So, in my despair,

434
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,538
I went to the only place
in the world

435
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:35,809
where I knew for sure
there were people who loved me.

436
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,750
<i>Back to the only man</i>
<i>in the world</i>

437
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:48,750
<i>that I ever kneeled down for.</i>

438
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,936
Hello, Daddy.

439
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,240
Haven't seen you
in ten years, child.

440
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,395
You been doing
that plastic surgery?

441
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:17,916
Mm-mm.

442
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:18,917
You been crying.

443
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:19,918
You hurt?

444
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:21,532
Only on the inside.

445
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:23,721
Real bad.

446
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,723
Can I come in?

447
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,159
Please?

448
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,495

449

Daddy.

456
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:50,281
You all right?

457
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:51,715
Oh, I...

458
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:53,451
just lost my place there
for a moment.

459
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,718
What were we talking about?

460
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:56,454
(laughs)

461
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:59,223
Honey, it happens
all the time now.

462
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:00,458
"Cassie, where my keys?

463
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,893
Cassie, what day is it?"

464
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:05,162
You talk to the doctor, Daddy?

465
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,931
Huh?
Your mama is the sick one.

466
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,368
Only room for one in the family.

467
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:17,974
Daddy, let me drive you over
to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.

468
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:19,942
I can drive myself

469
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,344
if I want to go.

470
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,813

471
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:25,815

472

488
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,496
Everything's gonna be fine.

489
00:24:58,065 --> 00:25:00,918
<i>I'd seen</i>
<i>what the virus had done.</i>

490
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:02,542
<i>Miraculous things.</i>

491
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:04,244
<i>Cuts healed.</i>

492
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,181
<i>Broken bones mended</i>
<i>in just a few days' time.</i>

493
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,783
<i>So why not?</i>

494
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:14,053
<i>Why couldn't it also</i>
<i>bring my daddy back to me?</i>

495
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:16,489
(sucking)

496
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,627
(exhales)

497
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,428
MAN (over TV): The forecast,
showers and thunderstorms today.

498
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:25,564
(door opens, closes)

499
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,567
Cassie?

500
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:30,803
Cassie, that you?

501
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:33,071
RAMONA:
<i>But neurons are not cuts,</i>

502
00:25:33,106 --> 00:25:36,942
<i>and a diseased brain</i>
<i>is not a broken bone.</i>

503
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:39,145
<i>All the virus had done</i>

504
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,181
<i>was stop</i>
<i>the Alzheimer's progression.</i>

505
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,818
Mama's gone, Daddy.

506
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:49,221
You know that.

507
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,192
Who are you?

508
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:56,195
It's me, Daddy.

509
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,464
Your daughter.

510
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:04,902
<i>He was in no condition</i>
<i>to hunt for himself</i>

511
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:09,340
<i>or to even understand</i>
<i>what he had become.</i>

512
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,676
<i>So I took care of him.</i>

513
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,612
<i>I brought him back blood</i>
<i>from my kills.</i>

514
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:18,015
<i>I held out hope that since</i>
<i>he wasn't getting any worse,</i>

515
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,285
<i>maybe he'd get better.</i>

516
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,118
<i>But he didn't get any better.</i>

517
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:23,687
<i>He just stayed the same.</i>

518
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:25,455
<i>We both did.</i>

519
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,292
<i>For 20 years.</i>

520
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,498
(glass shatters)
Daddy?! Daddy!

521
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:39,269
Daddy.

522
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:41,705
(TV playing quietly)

523
00:26:56,987 --> 00:27:00,590
<i>I couldn't let him live</i>
<i>like that,</i>

524
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:03,259
<i>frozen in amber.</i>

525
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:07,296
<i>So I gave him a Xanax</i>
<i>to make him calm.</i>

526
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,968
(sobs softly)

527
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:15,003
(water sloshing gently)

528
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,451
(sobs)

529
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:34,389
(crying)

530
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,595
<i>Once he was gone,</i>

531
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,066
I realized
that I was frozen in amber, too.

532
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,904
Decades with my father went by
like 20 minutes.

533
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:51,806
I forgot everything.

534
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,808
Felt nothing.

535
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:56,878
But a lot of things happened
in the world around me

536
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,312
in those years.

537
00:27:58,346 --> 00:27:59,647
The Internet.

538
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:01,182
Goddamn Hulu.

539
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,416
My old movies

540
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,318
streaming for free.

541
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:05,920
For free?

542
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:09,614
Folks started to recognize me
again on the street.

543
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:12,660
I started remembering.

544
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:14,728
All of it.

545
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:18,265
What I had, what had
been taken from me,

546
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,034
and what she had done to me.

547
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,803
My daddy's body died,

548
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:26,573
but the strength I took from
his breath stayed with me.

549
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:32,479
And I am going to use all of it
to ruin that woman.

550
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:39,186
To revenge.

551
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:45,792
(sighs)

552
00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:47,260
To revenge.

553
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,596
What are you doing?

554
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,600
Remember me, Max?

555
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:01,836
I'm Dr. Lowe.

556
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,771
Last time we saw each other
was at the hospital.

557
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:06,106
You were dying from measles.

558
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:07,907
I saved you
by giving you my blood.

559
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:10,910
Cool. Thanks.
Who are these other kids?

560
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:12,513
MAX:
They're from my class.

561
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:14,014
They drank my blood.

562
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:15,516
Now we're all alike.

563
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,618
GIRL:
Are you really a doctor?

564
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,819
We don't feel good.

565
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:21,288
Don't be stupid.

566
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:22,656
You don't need a doctor.

567
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,124
You have to drink the blood.

568
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,759
That's how you get better.

569
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:27,694
He's a fresh one, Madeline.

570
00:30:27,728 --> 00:30:29,696
Not like the homeless guy.

571
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,198
He tastes good.

572
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:33,232
ALEX:
You killed the homeless man?

573
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,135
It's all over the news.

574
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,737
You can't keep doing this.
The police are gonna find you.

575
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,372
I told you guys.

576
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,340
This is wrong.

577
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,976
I don't want to kill anymore.

578
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,645
They made me kill my parents.

579
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,010
JIMMY:
Duh!

580
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,150
We ate all our parents; that's
why nobody's looking for us.

581
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,785
I miss my mom.

582
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,252
MAX:
Madeline,

583
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:54,620
it's been, like, four days.

584
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:57,256
Your spots are coming back.
You have to drink.

585
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,659
All of you.

586
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:06,031
No.

587
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,669
You're burning up.

588
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:12,505
Listen, we should just off them.

589
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,173
All the sickies.

590
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,575
The only reason they're alive is

591
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:17,009
because you have
a crush on Madeline.

592
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,477
Shut up, Jimmy.

593
00:31:18,512 --> 00:31:20,313
Dude, don't use my real name.

594
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:21,980
Now she knows who I am!

595
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:24,250
Pretty soon, everybody's
gonna know who you are.

596
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,185
You killed
the pizza delivery guy.

597
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,752
In about 30 minutes,
they're gonna know

598
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,754
he went missing.
They have your address.

599
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,690
The cops are gonna come
right here to the house.

600
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,058
Come with me, all of you,
to the Hotel Cortez.

601
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,960
There are people there like us.

602
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,396
They'll know how to fix this.
MAX: Right.

603
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:41,833
'Cause that's what we need--
adults telling us what to do.

604
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,901
Screw that.

605
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,670
Listen, we have half an hour.

606
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,472
We can get out of here.

607
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,174
It's just... what about her?

608
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,175
(metallic swish)

609
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,680
You made the rule, Max.

610
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,747
Nobody leaves us alive.

611
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,681
No!

612
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,851
She made us.

613
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,653
She can leave.

614
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,188
Come with me to the hotel.

615
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,389
I said leave!

616
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,557
I can help you!

617
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,592
Fine. We're leaving.

618
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:09,927
You explain it to the cops.

619
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,605
(door creaks)

620
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:26,777
She's still out.

621
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,480
She probably won't
feel anything.

622
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,615
That's too bad.

623
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,651
My only regret

624
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,586
is that she won't know
what's coming

625
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,588
and who's giving it to her.

626
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,790
What are you gonna do?

627
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,744
RAMONA: I'm gonna stab her
in the heart, and then

628
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,527
cut off her head.

629
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,763
Make sure she stays dead.

630
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,265
What do you want me to do?

631
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,966
Watch.

632
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:54,237
See how someone with cojones
finishes the job.

633
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:04,480
(hissing)

634
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,616
(Ramona gasps)

635
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,785
(groans)
Ballsy enough for you?

636
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,154
IRIS: <i>Donovan,</i>
<i>I don't understand this.</i>

637
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,423
We're using her as bait?

638
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:16,759
Did she agree to this?

639
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,594
Is this plan "B"?

640
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,797
There is no plan "B."

641
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:23,366
Well, then what are we doing?

642
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,850
What are all these cameras for?

643
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,606
We are collecting our enemies
and putting them in here.

644
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,107
(chuckles)

645
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:34,644
We're gonna hate-watch.

646
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:37,347
Our enemies?

647
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:40,450
You mean her enemies, don't you?

648
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:43,319
Her enemies <i>are</i> my enemies.

649
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,455
Aw, shit.

650
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:46,989
God, Donovan.

651
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:49,425
She loves me, Iris.

652
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,993
And I never stopped loving her.

653
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,695
Anyone who's against us
is gonna end up in here,

654
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,630
so just keep that in mind.

655
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:58,367
There is no us with that bitch.

656
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:01,770
It's just her and surviving

657
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:04,272
until she decides it's
time for you to die!

658
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:06,608
The three of us, together--

659
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:09,778
it's the only chance
we have to destroy her.

660
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:13,482
Did you really think the three
of us could ever be partners?

661
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:15,216
Well, then why did you save me?

662
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:17,719
I was weak.

663
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:19,554
I should have let you die.

664
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:22,424
(sighs)

665
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,325
No.

666
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,127
You're the one
who's gonna die, son.

667
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:30,264
You should listen to your mama.

668
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,199
She's right.

669
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:33,901
Shut up.

670
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:35,770
Shut up!

671
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:37,705
Go.

672
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,374
You think
you're her one and only?

673
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,809
That's what you think?

674
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:43,944
She's already moved on

675
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:46,313
to the next one;
you can count on it.

676
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:47,981
You don't know that,

677
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:49,316
then you're more dumb

678
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,452
than you are pretty.

679
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:56,028
And you are <i>very</i> pretty.

680
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:01,261
VALENTINO: <i>It is a world</i>
<i>I no longer recognize</i>

681
00:35:01,296 --> 00:35:05,232
and which no longer
recognizes me.

682
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:08,068
Anonymity is your friend.

683
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:10,170
To survive, we must be cunning

684
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:12,172
and stick to the shadows.

685
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:15,442
Natacha does not
see it that way.

686
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:17,344
She has been drawn in
by the future.

687
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:20,447
This modern world speaks to her.

688
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:21,848
I haven't even seen her

689
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:23,883
since you gave her
that black plastic card.

690
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:28,055
She speaks of nothing
but shopping and... Uber.

691
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:30,958
She's costing me a fortune.

692
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:33,460
But it's worth it, I'll admit.

693
00:35:33,494 --> 00:35:36,429
I did it so I could
have you all to myself.

694
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:38,297
But I thought you loved Natacha.

695
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:40,047
I loved her because you did.

696
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:46,038
And because I was young and
lacking in self-confidence.

697
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:49,075
I thought I wasn't
woman enough for you.

698
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:51,344
Bellissima...

699
00:35:51,378 --> 00:35:54,013
you are woman enough
for the both of us.

700
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:58,384
When I look at you, I see
something of my vanished world.

701
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,120
We can have that world again.

702
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:02,622
No.

703
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,959
It is lost.

704
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:07,893
There is no place for
enchantment anymore.

705
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:09,328
We can make a place.

706
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:11,497
We can create one.

707
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:13,299
God knows I've been trying

708
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,601
to recreate you
for the last century.

709
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:19,905
A series of pale imitations,
gone, or soon to be.

710
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:22,341
I don't understand.

711
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:25,077
I've been clearing
the way for us.

712
00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:29,581
We are so close to recapturing
what we once lost.

713
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:31,917
I'm about to come into
a great deal of money.

714
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:34,887
We can use it to turn the Cortez

715
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,856
into a fortress
against the modern world.

716
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:40,725
A world I hate
even more than you.

717
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:42,427
And what of Natacha?

718
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:46,631
If something were
to happen to her...

719
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,000
could you go on?

720
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:52,203
I would have you to comfort me.

721
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:57,008
(door opens)

722
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:59,110
Little Mouse!

723
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:01,146
You were so right.

724
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,282
It's astounding what's become
of dusty Beverly Hills.

725
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:07,118
Shops, shops and more shops.

726
00:37:07,153 --> 00:37:09,219
Rudy, you won't believe
what I found.

727
00:37:09,254 --> 00:37:11,889
A store with your name on it--
"Valentino."

728
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:13,490
Hmm.

729
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:15,225
Retail's all well and good,
but for the true couture,

730
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,694
you have to come to my place.

731
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:18,362
Are you mad?

732
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:20,130
I'm never stepping foot
in the Cortez again.

733
00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:21,532
James March is long dead.

734
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,233
You're perfectly safe.

735
00:37:23,268 --> 00:37:26,537
I'll have a car come
pick you up later.

736
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:31,341
Oh, and, Rudy,
you're not invited.

737
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,510
It's just us girls tonight.

738
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,945
(chuckles)

739
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:39,716
(door opens, closes)

740
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:55,928
Anyone present knows any reason why

741
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:59,037
this man and this woman should
not be joined in marriage,

742
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,406
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

743
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,408
Uh... yeah.

744
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:05,643
Because she's a bitch

745
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:07,623
with no conscience, no mercy,

746
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,305
no soul.

747
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,398
(chuckles):
Oh, Liz.

748
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:13,751
Ignore her. She drinks.

749
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:15,536
But the law requires a witness.

750
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:16,831
And I've witnessed plenty.

751
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:18,523
Please proceed.

752
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,590
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

753
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:21,991
You may kiss the bride.

754
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:23,893

755
00:38:24,997 --> 00:38:28,631
My men, my family.

756
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:32,048
I am so happy to finally be
Mrs. Will Drake.

757
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:34,938
Dad, can I go upstairs now?

758
00:38:34,972 --> 00:38:36,206
Of course you may.

759
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,308
And I am going to go upstairs

760
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:40,743
and change out of this
beautiful gown you've made me

761
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,679
and put on my traveling clothes.

762
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:45,181
You sure you don't want to have
a drink to celebrate first?

763
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:47,098
That's what
the honeymoon is for.

764
00:38:47,218 --> 00:38:50,819
I'd like to get that started.
Well, I think I'm going to.

765
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:53,922
Your wife finds no reason
to object, and you own the bar.

766
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,157
Ah.

767
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,437
My darling Liz.

768
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,538
These are for you,

769
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:15,310
with my genuine hope that
you someday find true love.

770

Here's to new worlds to conquer.

00:40:16,056 --> 00:40:18,557

Acquainted, yes.
I never thought

793
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,704
I was the marrying kind,

794
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:35,274

the child was of my

00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,224
takes after his mother.

816
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:28,460
Holy shit!
What the hell is that thing?

817
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:29,894
COUNTESS:
And to think,

818
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:32,597
I was prepared
to love and raise <i>your</i> son.

819
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:34,766
What is going on?

820
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,235
What is this-- some,
some sort of prank?

821
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,438
That thing can't be yours.

822
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:40,582
It doesn't even look human.

823
00:41:40,702 --> 00:41:43,441
I thought to kill you in Paris,

824
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,910
but I could never stomach
traveling with someone

825
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:50,381
who said such hateful things
about my child.

826
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,758
I am going to make sure
you suffer, immensely.

827
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,725
(chuckles softly)

828
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:10,267
RAMONA:
Hey.

829
00:42:10,302 --> 00:42:13,838
Hey.

830
00:42:13,873 --> 00:42:15,339
Are you okay?

831
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:18,109
Where the hell are we?
Who are you?

832
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:20,444
One of her victims.

833
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:21,812
(groans)

834
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:22,980
Just like you.

835
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:24,748
(groans)

836
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:27,251
Uh, this... this is insane.

837
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,153
This can't be real.

838
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:32,689
You're about to find out
just how real it is,

839
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:34,358
when they come back down here

840
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:36,827
and stick you in that other one.

841
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,165
Please...
get me out of this.

842
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,134
Please!

843
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:45,903
(panting)

844
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:48,271
There's a handle in the back.

845
00:42:48,305 --> 00:42:50,306
Yeah.

846
00:42:50,341 --> 00:42:52,342
(groans):
Oh.

847
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:56,980
(metallic creaking)
Oh!

848
00:42:57,015 --> 00:42:59,016
(panting)

849
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,354
All right.

850
00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:06,823
- All right, it's gonna be okay.
- Oh.

851
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:09,358
There's got to be
a way out of here.

852
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:11,928
(sighs)

853
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,337
Hello?!

854
00:43:22,372 --> 00:43:24,373
Is anybody there?!

855
00:43:28,378 --> 00:43:30,345
Help!

856
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,683
Let us out of here!

857
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,519
Help!

858
00:43:37,554 --> 00:43:38,988
Jesus, I think it's soundproof.

859
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:42,024
No one even knows we're here.

860
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:43,859
We'll starve.

861
00:43:43,894 --> 00:43:45,827
I won't.

862
00:43:48,363 --> 00:43:50,832
(gurgling)

863
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:54,102
(Ramona yelling, Will groaning)

864
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,080
(sobs):
Help me.

865
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:07,148
Please.

866
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:09,117
(grunting, gurgling)

867
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:22,139
