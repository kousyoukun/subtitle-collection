1
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,830


2
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,300


3
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,930


4
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,140


5
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,480


6
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,650


7
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,530


8
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,450


9
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:15,710


10
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,250


11
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,420


12
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,420


17
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,320


18
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,320

20
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,320


21
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,320


22
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320


23
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,320


27
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:45,690


33
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:12,370


34
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:12,370


37
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,110
如今的人痴迷一切闪亮新鲜的事物
People today are obsessed with anything shiny and new.

38
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,740
但那都是幻觉
But it's all an illusion.

39
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,550
一切新潮的东西都会淡去
Everything new fades.

40
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,660
但一座被人遗忘的旅馆还是有些用处的
But forgotten hotels are still good for some things.

41
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,660
毒品交易
Drug deals.

42
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,550
老牛嫩草的婚外恋
May-December indiscretions.

43
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,030
还有一了百了
And ending it all.

44
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,110
我在哪都认得出那副表情
I knew that look anywhere.

45
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,150
见过太多次了
Seen it many times.

46
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,210
这两位幸运的人很满足
These two lucky birds are content.

47
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,000
甚至很平静
At peace, even.

48
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,690
他们说这是他们的结婚纪念日
It's their wedding anniversary, they tell me.

49
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,900
60年了
60 years.

50
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,720
四个孩子
Four kids.

51
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,450
九个孙辈
Nine grandchildren.

52
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,860
他们这辈子过得不错
They've had a good run together.

53
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,290
但她不像以往了
But she's not quite the same anymore

54
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,930
因为癌症扩散了
since the cancer spread.

55
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,180
他无法想象失去她的生活
And he can't imagine his life without her.

56
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,810
她最不希望的就是成为累赘
The last thing she wants is to be a burden.

57
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,400
于是他们来这儿
So they come here...

58
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,470
好独处
to be alone.

59
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,050
好再不必感到孤单了
So they never have to be alone again.

60
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,060
我
I...

61
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,340
嫉妒他们
envy them.

62
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,450
你见过比这更美丽的场面吗
Have you ever seen anything more beautiful?

63
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,850
我只能看到要洗洗刷刷八小时
All I can see is eight hours of hard scrubbing

64
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,450
才能把墙上的血都洗掉
gonna take to get the blood off these walls.

65
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,060
他们为什么就不能在自己家里
Why don't people have the courtesy

66
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,390
爆头呢
to blow their brains out at their own home?

67
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,570
如果被他们的孩子看到呢
What if one of the kids found them like this?

68
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,530
我不明白这为什么非要成为我的麻烦
Well, I don't see why that has to be my problem.

69
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,270
看看他们
Look at them.

70
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,350
你哭什么
Why are you crying?

71
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,370
他们很幸福啊
They were happy.

72
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,700
我觉得我再也开心不起来了
I feel like I'll never be happy again.

73
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,240
我假装我可以生活在没有特里斯坦的世界里
I pretend that I'm okay living in a world without Tristan,

74
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
但
but it's...

75
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,620
真的很艰难
it's been difficult.

76
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,080
而且
Besides,

77
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,890
就对女伯爵的了解  她迟早
knowing The Countess, it's just a matter of time

78
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,470
会割了我的喉咙
before she slits my throat.

79
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,930
何必等着别人
What's the point of waiting around for someone to...

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,550
背后给你一刀  死了不一了百了
stab you in the back when I'm already dead?

81
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,950
-不不不  -等等
- No, no, no, no, no. - Wait.

82
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,410
-让我做吧  -不
- Just let me do it. - No, no.

83
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,350
-我不想留在这儿了  -我知道
- I don't want to be here. - I know.

84
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,160
那你要永远困在这里了
Well, you're gonna be stuck here for all of eternity

85
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,280
除非你扣动扳机前
unless you get your head strapped on straight

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,790
什么都想清楚了
before pulling that trigger.

87
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,370
该死
Oh, shit.

88
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,060
天呐
Jesus.

89
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,330
你明白这回事的
You know how this goes.

90
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,870
嗯
Yeah.

91
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,560
我猜
And I'm guessing

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,120
你还有很多未了的心事吧
you have plenty of unfinished business still on your plate.

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,210
不  只有一桩
No, just one.

94
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,670
我儿子
My son.

95
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,120
我一直想弥补那事
I always meant to put that right.

96
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,760
告诉他很抱歉我抛弃了他
Tell him I'm sorry for leaving him.

97
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,580
好吧
Okay.

98
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,420
那你去做
So you do that.

99
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,780
这样我也有足够时间能取消《读者文摘》的订阅
And that'll give me enough time to cancel my Reader's Digest,

100
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,310
还有《乡村生活》
my Country Living.

101
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,240
然后我们就可以走了
Then we'll be ready to go.

102
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,750
我们
"We"?

103
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,270
你不用一个人来
You don't have to do this alone.

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,930
我不明白
I don't understand.

105
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,160
我以为你重生了
I thought you were reborn.

106
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,900
多诺万是我唯一的真爱
Donovan was my one true love.

107
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,050
他帮我从死亡边缘救回来时  我以为
I thought when he brought me back from the brink of death,

108
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,150
那是因为他爱我
it was because he loved me.

109
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,340
但他并不爱我
He doesn't love me.

110
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,990
他永远不会爱我
He never will.

111
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,520
那我们一起来
We'll do it together then.

112
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,120
利落地离世
Make a clean exit.

113
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,310
是的
Yes, dear,

114
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,350
科泰兹旅馆
the Hotel Cortez,

115
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
在洛杉矶市区
in downtown Los Angeles.

116
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,260
日子你也知道了
And you have the dates now.

117
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,950
是的
That's right, dear.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,370
一周  你父亲请客
One whole week-- your papa's treat.

119
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,360
什么
What's that, um...?

120
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,160
他想问  "为什么是现在"
He wants to know, "Why now?"

121
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,000
我本想找到你父亲问问
Well, I'd hoped to reach your father to ask,

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,320
但找不到
but alas, I cannot.

123
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,390
我得走了  再见
I-I must away. Bye now.

124
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,680
真的
Really...

125
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,640
我的感想难以言表
I can't thank you enough.

126
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,990
如果你不介意我问
If you don't mind my asking,

127
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,910
你多久没见过他了
how long has it been?

128
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,660
我已经31年没见过我儿子了
I haven't seen my son in 31 years.

129
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,370
我写过信
I've written letters.

130
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,450
我一直有寄支票
God knows I've written checks.

131
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,390
而银行对账单总会告诉我支票都兑现了
The bank statement always let me know that each one cleared.

132
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,700
我把这当做
I took that as...

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,460
一种迹象
a sign.

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,330
我要提醒你
I must caution you.

135
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,600
你并不知道那年轻人是怎么想的
You don't know exactly the young man's aspect.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,730
我不明白
I don't follow you.

137
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,350
他的世界观
His worldview.

138
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,300
你恐怕在要求他做到十分大度宽容
I-I fear you are challenging him to be very understanding.

139
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,910
你别说了
Let me stop you right there.

140
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,270
再我们那时候  同性恋知道不能生孩子
Back in my day, fairies knew never to father children.

141
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,810
那只会造成更多麻烦
It would, it would only add to the mayhem.

142
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,300
我亲戚  弗莱德里克
My cousin Frederick.

143
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,530
他总穿姐姐的
He was always getting into his sister's

144
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,950
女式睡衣和长袜
peignoir and stockings.

145
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,170
然后有一天  他找到了自己的位置
And-and then one day, he found his place.

146
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,830
他的人生坐标
His station in life.

147
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,670
在圣礼法衣中找到了宽慰
Took his comfort in the sacramental vestments.

148
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,910
他本可以当上大主教
He might've become a monsignor,

149
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,240
可惜他向自己的癖好屈服了
had he not succumbed to his appetites.

150
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,990
我不是个恋童癖
I'm not a pedophile!

151
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,950
我早就不关心
I lost interest long ago

152
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,800
你究竟自称是什么了
in whatever you claim to be.

153
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,040
不  我只知道  有个可怜的男孩
No, all I know is some poor boy

154
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,690
往后院丢球
threw a ball in the backyard,

155
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,720
突然
and suddenly

156
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,520
他骄傲的爸爸就不能接住那球了
his proud papa wasn't there to catch it.

157
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,740
而如今  这个男孩
So now here comes this same little boy

158
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,470
要来见个他一直想见的人
to visit someone he's always longed to see.

159
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,120
结果却见到了
And instead he's going to be confronted

160
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,780
蒂达·巴拉的鬼魂
by the ghost of Theda Bara.

161
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,580
这的确很吓人
I mean, it's-it's quite a fright indeed.

162
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,570
够了
That's enough!

163
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,790
总之
Anyhoo.

164
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,280
你答应给我的东西呢
Where's that item you promised me?

165
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,010
你没忘记你要做的吧
You haven't forgotten your end of the bargain.

166
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,600
请用
Have at it.

167
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,920
疯去吧
Go nuts.

168
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,890
谁能想到啊
Oh, who would have thought?

169
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,150
-肥皂里有氧气  -是啊
- Oxygen in the soap! - Yes.

170
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,250
老天爷  看啊
For God's sake, look.

171
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,370
"又白又亮"
"Radiant whites," It says.

172
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,060
你真是个奇迹
You are an absolute marvel.

173
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,820
就像圣诞节的早晨
It's like Christmas morning.

174
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,560
{\an8}不可尊他神

175
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,410
耳朵
Ears.

176
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,530
他们聆听伪神的互换
For they heard the calling of false gods.

177
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,120
你是个聪明人  约翰·劳
You're a clever man, John Lowe.

178
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
放空你的心
Empty your hearts.

179
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,900
让影之女神听到你们的祷告
Let the Lady of Shadows hear your prayers.

180
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,030
欢迎来我们教会
Welcome to our church.

181
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,100
你是第一次来吗
Is this your first time here?

182
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,880
要知道旧神未死
Know that the old gods are not dead.

183
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,600
他们在等待唤醒
They're waiting to be awakened.

184
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,690
你叫什么
What is your name?

185
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,730
我是
I am...

186
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,880
死亡
death.

187
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
不
No!

188
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,610
再杀一个你就自由了
One more and you'll be free.

189
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,770
{\an9}BGM: Lucretia My Reflection - Sister of Mercy

190
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,960
这是怎么回事
What is the meaning of this?

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,970
欢迎
Welcome.

192
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
多谢你来
Thank you for coming.

193
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,430
你想怎么样
What do you want?

194
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,050
你是谁
Who are you?

195
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,460
我是谁
Who am I?

196
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,880
我是你  混蛋
I'm you, asshole.

197
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,230
我们得谈谈
We need to have a little talk.

198
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,040
我也不觉得你叫我来这儿
I didn't really think that you brought me here

199
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,130
是来翻你的旧衣服的
to rummage through your old clothes.

200
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,450
而且我反正对你不要的东西也不感兴趣
And I'm not interested in your castoffs anyway.

201
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,820
但我知道你喜欢我不要的
Though I know you're very interested in mine.

202
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,550
你了解我的生平吗
So, you know my entire biography?

203
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,710
在一堵墙后封了数十年
Damned behind a wall for decades.

204
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,520
如今要再次受罪
And now ready to be damned again.

205
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,920
我爱她
I love her!

206
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,690
你以为你爱他吗
You think you love him?

207
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,090
你爱的不过是一段远去的记忆
You love a distant memory.

208
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,250
你爱的是大银幕上的一个形象
You love an image on a screen.

209
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,010
你对他来说不过是个粉丝
You're nothing more than a fan to him.

210
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,650
你的怒气很常见
You know, your petulance is very common.

211
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,180
那些风光不再的帅气男孩
It is always this way with pretty boys

212
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,220
总会如此
who are past their prime.

213
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,980
你该长长胡子
You should grow out that little beard, you know?

214
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,300
或许你能在西部片里找到活儿干
Maybe you could find, uh, work in the Westerns.

215
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,360
我们不需要你
We don't need you.

216
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,060
你根本不知道
You know nothing

217
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,100
我有多聪明
of my resourcefulness,

218
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,900
小老鼠
little mouse.

219
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,150
你可以走了
You can go.

220
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,550
你在真实世界里
You wouldn't last two days

221
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,520
跟女伯爵连两天都撑不下去
with The Countess in the real world.

222
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,350
等她看到你听到交通直升机
Once she sees how you shit yourself

223
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,420
就吓得拉裤子  就会抛弃你
at the sound of a traffic helicopter.

224
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
我非常了解你
Oh, I know all about you.

225
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,580
我是史上最伟大的银幕情人
I am the greatest screen lover of all time.

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,950
你很廉价
You're cheap.

227
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
你一直很廉价
You've always been cheap.

228
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,360
你居然有把剑
You have a freaking sword.

229
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,440
我们第一次跳完探戈我就该杀了你
I should've killed you after our first tango.

230
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,760
死在这把剑下是你的荣幸
You should be honored to die by its blade.

231
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,420
得了
Bitch, please.

232
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,110
不是吧
Really?

233
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,810
现在谁是小老鼠了
Who's the little mouse now?

234
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,670
她会为这张帅气的脸痛苦的
She's gonna mourn over that pretty face.

235
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,280
你现在不漂亮了吧
You're not so pretty now, are you?

236
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,460
反正我的颧骨也比你好看
I have better cheekbones, anyway.

237
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,920
漂亮多了
Cheekbones for days.

238
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,370
救命  救命
Help! Help!

239
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,450
有人听得到吗  救命
Can anybody hear me?! Help!

240
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,590
随你怎么吼
You can scream as loud as you like.

241
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,500
事实上  那样更好
In fact, I prefer it.

242
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,330
你想要怎么样
What do you want from me?

243
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,750
救命  不要
Help me. No.

244
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,230
你失败了
You failed.

245
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,560
我是个承包商
I'm a contractor.

246
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,940
我会做乐观的估计
I make optimistic projections.

247
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,110
拜托  我愿做任何事
Please, I'll do anything.

248
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,310
我会弥补你的
I'll make this up to you.

249
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,640
求你  别这么做
Please, don't do this.

250
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,560
你叫我做什么都行  求你
I'll do anything you want, please.

251
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,820
求你  不要
Please don't.

252
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,920
守信  是一个人的基本品质
A man is only as good as his word.

253
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,390
你干什么
What are you doing?

254
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,660
保持练习
Keeping up the practice.

255
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,560
我为我们定下了宏大的计划
I have great plans for us, you and me.

256
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,750
自从我死后
Ever since my death,

257
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,410
我的狩猎场就受限了
my hunting grounds have been limited

258
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,140
只能在这间旅馆里
to the confines of this hotel.

259
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,170
这里虽然不错
And as rich as it may be,

260
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,830
但你可以拥有我只能
there are opportunities available to you

261
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,360
梦想的机会
that I can only dream of.

262
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,850
我老婆呢
Where's my wife?

263
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,160
别管她了
Forget her.

264
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,480
我觉得妻子只让人分心
I find spouses to be a distraction.

265
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,730
我怀疑我妻子就向警方检举了我
I suspect my own to have ended my career prematurely

266
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,500
害得我的事业过早结束
by turning me in to the police.

267
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,900
但我已经原谅她了
I've forgiven her, of course,

268
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,800
因为她是如此美丽
because of her immense beauty.

269
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,720
我得找到亚历克丝
I need to find Alex.

270
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,030
你知道她在哪
You know where she is.

271
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,440
当然
Of course.

272
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,970
我无所不知
I know everything.

273
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,960
我就只有时间和想象
I have nothing but time and imagination.

274
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,230
但我为我们做的打算  将超越十诫
But what I have planned for us, beyond the Ten Commandments,

275
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,470
将你提升至我们这行的巅峰位置
will elevate you to the zenith of our profession.

276
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,310
你可以获得这份荣誉  约翰
You take the glory, John.

277
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,790
我则谦卑地站在你的影子里
I'll stand humbly in your shadow.

278
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,400
告诉我她在哪
You tell me where she is

279
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,850
否则你的梦就只会是梦
or your dreams are just that.

280
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,020
早熟
Precocious.

281
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,790
我的明星学生当然会如此
I'd expect nothing less from my star pupil.

282
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,870
来吧
Come!

283
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,370
你的团聚等着你呢
Your reunion awaits.

284
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,760
新煮咖啡的蒸汽
There's nothing like the steam from a fresh pot

285
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,140
最能化肺部的痰了
to loosen the phlegm from the lungs.

286
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,610
谢谢
Thank you.

287
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,550
你们可别空着肚子争吵
You mustn't have an argument on an empty stomach.

288
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,470
那样一天都会不舒服
It upsets the balance of the day.

289
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,120
你叫醒我
I'm sure you didn't wake me up

290
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,520
肯定不是来喝咖啡的
to have a cup of coffee.

291
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,970
你告诉我霍尔登只是我的幻觉
You told me Holden was a hallucination.

292
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,970
那是谎言
That was a lie.

293
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,920
你想让我以为自己要疯了
You tried to make me think I was going crazy.

294
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,420
那是事实
Well, that was the truth.

295
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,220
你让我见不到自己的儿子
You kept my son away from me.

296
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,650
如果你还没注意到
In case you haven't noticed,

297
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,270
他已经不是你印象里的那个孩子了
he's not the child you knew.

298
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,250
我选择跟霍尔登在一起
I made my choice to be with Holden.

299
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,590
我没告诉你
I didn't tell you

300
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,490
是怕你会说什么改变我的主意
because I was afraid you would say something to change my mind.

301
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,590
我不后悔我的决定
I don't regret my decision.

302
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,860
我们还有一个孩子呢
We have another child.

303
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,360
我并没忘记斯嘉丽
I haven't forgotten about Scarlett.

304
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,400
这么久以来
All this time,

305
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,150
你只见过她两次
you've seen her twice.

306
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,810
她告诉我了
She told me.

307
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,240
你又去过外婆家几次
And how many times have you been to visit Grandma?

308
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,680
没有借口
No excuses.

309
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,220
我们抛弃了她
We abandoned her.

310
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,450
我们是世上最差的父母
We're the world's worst parents.

311
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,360
至少这事我们都同意
Well, at least that's one thing we can agree on.

312
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,260
或许没有我  斯嘉丽会过得更好
Maybe it'll be better for Scarlett with me gone.

313
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,950
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

314
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,530
我们有麻烦了
We're in trouble.

315
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,890
我前一阵犯了个错误
I made a mistake a while ago,

316
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,770
女伯爵认为那是我的责任
and The Countess holds me responsible.

317
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,800
告诉我
Tell me.

318
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,500
一群野孩子
A pack of wild children

319
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,420
把人的血都吸光了
drained a man of all his blood.

320
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,020
你有什么想告诉我的吗  亚历克丝
Anything you want to tell me, Alex?

321
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,020
我救了我的病人  麦克斯得了麻疹要死了
I saved my patient. Max was dying from measles.

322
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,220
那你就转化了他  而他转化了其他人
So you turned him... and he turned the others.

323
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,550
给你一个机会解决这个问题
One chance to fix this problem.

324
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,140
女伯爵说她会杀了我和霍尔登
Countess told me she'd kill me and Holden

325
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,910
除非我解决问题
if I didn't make things right.

326
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,420
我知道这不是你的事
I know it's not your problem...

327
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,130
如果跟你和霍尔登有关
If it involves you and Holden,

328
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,260
那就是我的事
it's my problem.

329
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,340
我们怎么办
What do we have to do?

330
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,540
啪
Tap.

331
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,180
啪啪啪
Tap-tap-tap.

332
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
啪啪啪
Tap-tap-tap.

333
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,000
那是莫尔斯码的"他要上楼来了"
That's Morse Code for "He's coming up the stairs."

334
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,270
抓紧你的珍珠项链吧  爸爸
Clutch your pearls, Daddy.

335
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,240
老天爷
Good God.

336
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,580
没想到我会这么紧张
I didn't think I'd be so nervous.

337
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,270
你儿子已经在房里安顿好了
Your son is all settled in his room.

338
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,500
他知道有赠送的酒票
He knows about the complimentary drink tickets,

339
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,190
他来兑酒了
and here he comes to redeem them.

340
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,040
好了
Okay.

341
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,510
再见吧
Bye now.

342
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,250
下午好
Good afternoon.

343
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,760
现在是减价[快乐]时间
It's happy hour,

344
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,880
所以...
so...

345
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,800
想笑就笑吧
feel free to smile.

346
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,340
想不想
Maybe...

347
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,840
来点喝的
something to drink?

348
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,150
好
Sure.

349
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,370
波本威士忌加冰吧
How about a bourbon rocks?

350
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,460
再来杯苏打水
And a soda back, please.

351
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,570
我叫道格拉斯
I'm Douglas.

352
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,830
叫我丽兹就行
Call me Liz.

353
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,040
你是
What's your, uh...

354
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,030
你是做哪一行的
what's your line of work?

355
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,840
我为一个在丹佛附近
Uh, I work for a guy who owns huge properties packed

356
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,930
用自助仓库
with self-storage units

357
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,560
存放巨额财产的人工作
in and around Denver.

358
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,510
公司很能挣钱
Company makes some serious coin...

359
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,400
我可挣不了多少
not that I do.

360
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,340
顺便说一句  我喜欢你的裙子
Hey, I like your dress, by the way.

361
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,500
很耀眼
Sparkly!

362
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,420
你管它们叫什么
What do you call those?

363
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,360
什么
What?

364
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,190
那些圆东西
Uh, the... those round things.

365
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,900
这个
The... oh.

366
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,770
亮片
Paillettes.

367
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,910
然后...  我妻子
And then... then my wife insisted

368
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,660
坚持让我换工作
that I needed to find a new boss.

369
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,510
她说  倒不如
Or to... better yet, she said,

370
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,330
我自己当老板
to be my own.

371
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,110
我是说...
I mean...

372
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,690
别怪她
Give her a break.

373
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,540
你妻子可真精明
Your bride sounds astute.

374
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,390
是啊
Yeah.

375
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,760
确实
Yeah, she is.

376
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,820
可房贷一点都拖不了
But that doesn't make the mortgage payment any less late.

377
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,300
我们都有梦想  是吧
We all have dreams, you know?

378
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,520
但这不意味着就要抛弃一切
Not meant to drop everything...

379
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,290
不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

380
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,460
我不同意
I disagree.

381
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,360
你要继续奋斗
You go ahead.

382
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,250
搬去博尔德  成立你的皮艇公司
You move to Boulder and you start that kayak company.

383
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,050
抱歉  让你听我唠叨了这么久
Anyway, I'm sorry to bend your ear.

384
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,100
其实我一直不太健谈
I've always kept my own counsel, you know?

385
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,070
从小...
Coming up, it was, uh...

386
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,920
就只有我和妈妈相依为命
just my mom and I.

387
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,780
爸爸走了
Dad split.

388
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,560
错过了我打得最好的曲棍球联赛季
Missed my one great season in Pee Wee League.

389
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,940
我不能怪他
I can't blame the guy.

390
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,340
我当时是个淘气的孩子
I was a rambunctious kid.

391
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,790
这不怪你
You shouldn't blame yourself.

392
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,510
你父亲肯定有什么原因
I'm sure your father had his reasons.

393
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,250
我要是听说了原因
Well, those'll be news to me,

394
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,540
才新奇呢
whenever I hear 'em.

395
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,950
我心里一直想着他
I guess he's on my mind.

396
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,530
我来到这里是因为...
I'm in town 'cause we're...

397
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,830
我和爸爸终于联系上了
finally gonna reconnect.

398
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,180
为这干一杯吧
Here's to that.

399
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,470
好
Yeah.

400
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,790
下一杯我请
This, uh, next one's on me.

401
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,990
你真好
Nice of you.

402
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,890
还是下次吧
Maybe another time.

403
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,240
我很愿意
I'd like that.

404
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,810
我们来得太迟了
We're too late.

405
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,650
警察肯定已经追查到送货员了
The police must have tracked down the delivery boy.

406
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,480
孩子们一定早就不在了
Kids must be long gone.

407
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,520
也许没有
Maybe not.

408
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,750
里面有人
Somebody's inside.

409
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,440
待在这
Stay here.

410
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,510
你好
Hey there.

411
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,960
你叫什么
What's your name?

412
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,450
金米
Kimmy.

413
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,800
我要找妈妈
I want my mommy.

414
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,270
好  金米
Okay, Kimmy.

415
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,980
让我看看你怎么了
Let's see what's going on with you.

416
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,310
别碰她
Get away from her!

417
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,680
别动
Don't move!

418
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,760
你在流血
You're bleeding.

419
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,870
我没事
I'm okay.

420
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,880
别逼我开枪
Don't make me have to shoot you.

421
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,240
你吓不了我的
You don't scare me.

422
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,840
我们的人数比你们多多了
There's a lot more of us than you.

423
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,270
我们告诉过你别回来了
We told you not to come back.

424
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,180
金米
Kimmy!

425
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,670
求求你
Please.

426
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,490
求求你  你得帮帮她
Please, you have to help her!

427
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,590
玛蒂  后退
Maddie! Get back.

428
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,450
你准备好了吗  呼吸  准备好了吗
You ready? Breathe for me. Ready?

429
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,880
振作点  宝贝
Come on, honey.

430
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,480
振作点  金米
Come on, Kimmy.

431
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,450
-治好她  -我不能停
- Fix her! - I can't stop.

432
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,280
金米  醒过来
Kimmy, come on.

433
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,850
快醒来
Come here.

434
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,520
快醒来
Come on.

435
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,040
你怎么停了
Why did you stop?

436
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,580
帮帮她
Help her!

437
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,860
对金米来说已经太晚了
It's too late for Kimmy.

438
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,120
醒醒啊
Come on.

439
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,310
对你们其他人来说还不晚
It doesn't have to be too late for the rest of you.

440
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:41,371
你丈夫失踪多久了  德雷克夫人
How long has your husband been missing, Mrs. Drake?

441
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:42,681
周三晚失踪的
Since Wednesday evening.

442
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:46,851
他跟我说的最后一句话是"我愿意"
Virtually the last thing he said to me was, "I do."

443
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:50,881
然后我来到这儿换衣服  收拾完东西
Then I came up here to change and finish packing.

444
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,851
他要去酒吧喝酒
He was going to the bar for a drink.

445
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:58,041
那是我最后一次听到他的消息
That's the last I heard from him.

446
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,061
换了是我还不至于惊慌  德雷克夫人
I wouldn't panic yet, Mrs. Drake.

447
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,831
有些新郎  他们会在婚礼后
Some grooms, um, they get cold feet

448
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:06,021
而不是婚礼前  打退堂鼓
after the ceremony instead of before.

449
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,421
你不了解我丈夫
Oh, you don't know my husband.

450
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:12,201
他是个非常负责的人
He's a very responsible human being.

451
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,811
他肯定不会就这样丢下新娘
He would never abandon his new bride

452
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:17,871
还有他年幼的儿子
or his young son this way.

453
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:20,081
肯定出了什么事
Something must have happened.

454
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,841
亲爱的  我不知道有客人来
Darling, I wasn't aware we had visitors.

455
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:25,041
我是威尔·德雷克
I'm Will Drake.

456
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:27,441
亲爱的
Dearest.

457
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:32,511
先生  你妻子以为你失踪了
Sir, your wife was under the impression you'd gone missing.

458
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,611
"失踪"
"Missing"?

459
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:35,051
不
No.

460
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,841
不  我刚在七楼看翻修的房间呢
No, I was just exploring the new renovation on the seventh floor

461
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:40,601
在走廊里迷路了两天
and got lost in the hallways for two days.

462
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,991
我很愿意带你一起看看
I'd love to show it to you.

463
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:44,661
-我妻子亲自设计的  -我们真不应该
- My wife designed it herself. - Oh, we couldn't possibly waste

464
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:45,711
你们真该看看里面都有什么
You really should see what's in there.

465
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:46,761
浪费警官们的时间
these officers' time any longer.

466
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:48,601
我太抱歉了
I am so sorry...

467
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,921
给你们添了这么多麻烦
for how I've inconvenienced you.

468
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:54,731
我糊涂了
I was... confused.

469
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:55,881
没事
Yeah.

470
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:58,941
我们很高兴  一切都好
Well, we're just glad everything turned out okay.

471
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:03,591
万事大吉  没有难看的局面发生
A happy ending without all the tugging and the pushing and...

472
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:05,381
谢谢  再次感谢你们
Thank you. Thank you again.

473
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,581
你杀了我  贱人
You murdered me, you bitch.

474
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:12,381
想开点吧
Oh, get over it.

475
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,761
是你先惹我的
You pissed me off.

476
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:17,531
你在侮辱巴塞洛缪
You made disparaging remarks about Bartholomew.

477
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,331
我忍不了
That I cannot abide.

478
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:20,531
胡扯
Bullshit.

479
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,541
你一直都是这么琢磨的
This was your plan all along.

480
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,371
那现在怎么办
So what happens now?

481
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:29,701
我的尸体出现在某条肮脏的小路上
My body turns up in some filthy alleyway?

482
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,521
你掌控我的帝国
You take control of my empire?

483
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,101
我会解散帝国  把它变成现金
I thought I'd dissolve the empire, convert it to cash.

484
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:38,901
你忘了
Well, you forget.

485
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:40,951
遗嘱里没有你
You're not in the will.

486
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:44,431
不  你忘了
No, you forget.

487
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,551
拉科伦继承一切
Lachlan inherits everything.

488
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,031
你让我成为了他的法定监护人
And you made me his legally appointed guardian.

489
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:02,911
我会监护他
I'll be guiding him.

490
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,851
直到他成年
Only until he reaches his majority.

491
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:09,111
假设他能活到成年
Assuming he ever does.

492
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:15,691
你拿我儿子威胁我吗
Are you threatening my son?

493
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:19,471
我不杀孩子  但我可以把他变成血亲
I don't kill children, but I could make him a blood relative.

494
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,041
你是说像那个在走廊里把我吸干的女人
You mean like that woman who sucked me dry in the hallway.

495
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,741
你死了之后比活着时聪明多了
You're a lot smarter dead than you ever were alive.

496
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:30,491
把这股聪明劲儿保持下去
Try and keep it that way.

497
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,951
何不去看看我们的儿子呢
Why don't you go visit our son?

498
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:38,171
我不想让他伤心
We wouldn't want anything to upset him.

499
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:42,151
告诉他我们最终决定不去巴黎度蜜月了
Tell him we decided not to honeymoon in Paris after all.

500
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:46,001
我建议过你不要在旅馆里杀他
I advised you not to kill him on the premises.

501
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,431
咬我啊
Bite me.

502
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:27,981
走廊尽头有间房
There's a room at the end of the hall.

503
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,201
都为你们准备好了
It's ready for you.

504
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,601
我会尽量给你们找些东西吃
I'm gonna try and find you something or someone to eat.

505
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:32,861
你们肯定饿极了
You must be starving.

506
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:36,121
我们可以在外面等你回来
We can wait out here till you get back.

507
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:37,711
我一会儿就回来
I'll just be a sec.

508
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:45,851
好吧
Okay.

509
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:47,481
来吧
Come on.

510
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:08,701
往里走
Go on in.

511
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,981
你朋友们等着你呢
Your friends are waiting for you.

512
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:14,021
我不想
I don't want to.

513
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:15,501
进去吧
Let's go.

514
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:18,961
-不  -不
- No! - No!

515
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:21,221
-不  -不
- No! - No!

516
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:22,741
救命
Help!

517
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,671
开门  开门
Open up! Open it!

518
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:31,851
放我们出去  开门
Let us out! Open up!

519
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:35,391
麦克斯
Max!

520
00:28:36,371 --> 00:28:39,121
跟你说了  不该相信那贱人
I told you, we should have never trusted that bitch!

521
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:40,381
闭嘴
Shut up!

522
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:13,941
妈妈
Mama...

523
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:16,751
闻到了美味
smells appetizers.

524
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,211
如果我像那群孩子一样
What if I look like teenager

525
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,831
被抓到了怎么办
that's about to get caught?

526
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:28,723
我们要离婚了
We're getting a divorce.

527
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:30,783
不该睡在一起
We're not supposed to be sleeping together.

528
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,753
谁说我们真要离婚了
Who says we have to go through with it?

529
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,076
我说的
I do.

530
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:40,106
我给你协议书后  有什么变化吗
Has anything really changed since I gave you the papers?

531
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:42,146
都变了
Everything.

532
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,036
你找到了霍尔登
You found Holden.

533
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,366
你也变了  对吧
You are different, aren't you?

534
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:51,166
你的眼神中多了一份坚定
Something solid behind your eyes.

535
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,286
你完全好了
You're all there.

536
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,756
你终于恢复了  约翰
Finally got it together, John.

537
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:11,806
我做不到
I can't.

538
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:15,536
我得慢慢来
I have to process this.

539
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,326
我还得看看霍尔登和孩子们
And I have to check on Holden and the kids.

540
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:26,736
但我很喜欢新的约翰
I am interested in this new John, though.

541
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:40,956
你射在她里面了
Did you come inside her,

542
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:44,026
还是像对我一样  射在她奶上了
or did you shoot on her tits like you do with me?

543
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:49,666
萨莉
Sally.

544
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,356
上妓女  就射在奶上
With the whore, it's always on the tits.

545
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:57,266
我对你来说就是吧
That's what I am to you.

546
00:30:58,226 --> 00:30:59,646
妓女
A whore.

547
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:02,046
你错了
You're wrong.

548
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:03,766
不是这样的
It's not like that.

549
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:06,466
我说过你对于我的意义
I told you what you meant to me.

550
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:07,746
没错
Yeah.

551
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:10,976
你说过你爱我
You told me you loved me.

552
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:13,996
别想抵赖
And don't you dare deny it.

553
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:15,366
我不是骗子
I'm not a liar.

554
00:31:15,446 --> 00:31:16,776
我爱过你
I have loved you.

555
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:21,086
但那只是上瘾般的着迷
But what we have is an addict's high.

556
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:25,826
当时看来永远不会散
In the moment, it seems like it's never ending.

557
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,176
但一切都有结束的时候
But it always ends.

558
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,636
不
Oh, no.

559
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:33,306
不  亲爱的
Oh, no, baby.

560
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:38,526
再也不会有我这样的人
There will never be anyone like me.

561
00:31:38,786 --> 00:31:39,846
约翰
John...

562
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:44,436
你能说这不是你想要的吗
you can't tell me that this isn't what you want.

563
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:10,786
不
No.

564
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,366
亚历克丝不是你的归宿
Alex is not the answer.

565
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:22,356
她不了解你
She doesn't know about you.

566
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,596
没我了解你
Not the way I do.

567
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:31,786
她发现事实后要怎样么接受呢
How's she gonna take it when she finds out the truth?

568
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:36,486
你是个连环杀手
That you're a serial killer.

569
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:40,256
她会重新接受你吗
You think she'll take you back?

570
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:44,826
像我这样包容你
Accept you the way I do?

571
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,906
不  我得尽力一试
No, I have to try.

572
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,256
为了斯嘉丽和霍尔登
For Scarlett and for Holden.

573
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:02,696
鬼话
Bullshit.

574
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:07,686
这都是为了你自己
This is for you.

575
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:11,586
为了你
It's for you.

576
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:14,496
说得没错
You're right.

577
00:33:15,186 --> 00:33:17,126
如果我要坦诚面对自己的话
If I'm being honest with myself.

578
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,926
她离开了你
She left you.

579
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,416
她骗了你
She lied to you.

580
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:33,826
她想把你赶出她的生活
She wanted you out of her life.

581
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:37,386
我陪了你五年
I was there for five years.

582
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,746
对不起
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,026
我不该被这样对待
I deserve more than this!

584
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:19,006
滚开
Stay away from me.

585
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,466
你会回来的  混蛋
You'll be back, asshole!

586
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:24,936
她一旦知道你的真实面目  就会离开你
She'll leave you once she learns what you are.

587
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:28,036
她会离开你  不然我就去杀了那贱人
She'll leave you, or maybe I'll kill that bitch!

588
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:35,316
这是我见过
Oh, it's the most beautiful thing

589
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:37,506
最美的东西
I have ever laid eyes on.

590
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:40,636
谢谢你们  谢谢
Oh, thank you, thank you.

591
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:44,726
我...  要怎么用来着
Oh, oh, how-how... how do I use it again?

592
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:50,306
这个键摁一下是冷水
Uh, okay, you press this once for cold.

593
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,106
摁两下是热水
And twice for hot.

594
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:55,526
甚至单独设置了洗轻柔衣物的程序
And there's even a separate setting for delicates.

595
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:58,726
而且再也不用拧水了
Oh, and no more wringing.

596
00:34:58,726 --> 00:34:59,766
再也不用拧水了
No more wringing.

597
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:01,946
美好的一天啊
Oh, heavenly day.

598
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:05,346
谢谢你帮我重新联系上我儿子
Thank you for helping me reconnect with my son

599
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:08,816
还帮他铺好床
and for giving him such excellent turndown service.

600
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:10,826
我们可以走了吗
So... good to go?

601
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:12,356
行  我看可以了
Oh, yeah, I think so.

602
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:16,146
我们定下办法了吗
Um, have we settled on a method?

603
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:19,346
药  枪  刀
Pills? Gun? Knife?

604
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:22,266
尼罗河女王  我得告诉你
Oh, Queen of the Nile, I must tell you.

605
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:25,376
你儿子在蓝鹦鹉酒吧坐了有一会儿了
Your son has been perched in the Blue Parrot for quite a while.

606
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,866
你想让我告诉他你不会去了吗
Would you like me to tell him that you will not be back?

607
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,756
-因为你要自杀  -该死
- Because you're doing yourself in? - Shit.

608
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,386
我想占用你一点时间
Mainly wanted a moment of your time.

609
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,066
行啊
Okay.

610
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:35,546
怎么了
Really?

611
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:37,926
我想跟你说些事情
I just wanted to tell you something.

612
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,386
珍妮丝和我要去博尔德了
Janice and I are Boulder-bound.

613
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:43,776
好啊  干一杯
Well, cheers to that.

614
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:46,086
谢谢你帮了一把
Thanks for the push in the right direction.

615
00:35:49,386 --> 00:35:50,736
我也有事要告诉你
I have something to tell you.

616
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:56,776
这很难...  开口
And... it's... rather difficult.

617
00:36:02,316 --> 00:36:04,316
爸爸
Hey... Dad.

618
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,036
其实不难
It's not difficult.

619
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:10,966
其实  不用你开口
Or... it doesn't have to be.

620
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,576
妈妈给了我一些线索
Mom gave me a few clues.

621
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,966
我梳理了一下
I put them together.

622
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:21,876
她警告我
She warned me

623
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:24,286
我会认不出你来  但我认出来了
that I wouldn't recognize you, but I-I did.

624
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,386
我认出来了
I mean, I do.

625
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,466
你身上没有我的影子
I don't recognize myself in you.

626
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:38,966
我怎么会这么幸运  养育出一个
How did I get so lucky to raise a child

627
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:40,566
如此
so...

628
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:43,706
善良的孩子
compassionate?

629
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,026
妈妈养育了我
Mom raised me.

630
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:46,546
你抛弃了我们
You left.

631
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:49,996
这很伤人
That hurt.

632
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:52,686
也许这也是为什么
And maybe that's what...

633
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:57,066
我能看清其他人一团糟的...
...makes me see when other people are all...

634
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,776
内心
messed up inside.

635
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:03,176
而且珍妮丝很懂我
Plus, Janice hears me, you know?

636
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:07,476
就算我连自己都不懂的时候
Even when I don't even know what I mean.

637
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:14,326
我告诉她
And I told her

638
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:17,716
我今晚要和你相认
that I was gonna make things good tonight.

639
00:37:20,516 --> 00:37:22,296
她很为我俩高兴
And she's happy for us both.

640
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:25,606
你完全可以接受你父亲
You have no problem with the fact

641
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:27,286
是个女人的事实吗
that your father is a woman?

642
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:31,346
佩德罗在《真实世界》中死后
I really learned something when Pedro died...

643
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:33,546
我体会到很多
...on The Real World.

644
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,366
抱歉
Sorry.

645
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:39,306
我一直在感悟生活
And I kept learning.

646
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:44,626
说来话长了  丽兹
Plenty of time to talk it out, Liz.

647
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:46,796
但是
But, hey,

648
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:51,716
我的生活还有足够的空间去再多容纳一个女人
there's plenty of room for another woman in my life.

649
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:56,726
好的
Okay.

650
00:37:58,306 --> 00:38:02,936
天啊  我太喜欢看你用刀了
My goodness, I do love watching you work with a knife.

651
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:07,586
接到你的电话我有点吃惊
I was a little surprised to get your call.

652
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:10,216
我还以为你会在巴黎
I figured you'd be in Paris,

653
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:11,386
谋杀亲夫呢
murdering your husband

654
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,006
然后把尸体扔进塞纳河
and dumping his body in the Seine.

655
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:15,786
我干了件蠢事
I did a rather stupid thing, I suppose.

656
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,436
但那会儿脑子一热
Felt great at the time,

657
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,656
现在得有一点小麻烦要处理了
but now I have a bit of a mess to deal with.

658
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:22,956
我知道你的意思
Oh, I know just what you mean.

659
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:26,786
我们出发度蜜月之前
Before we could leave for our honeymoon,

660
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:28,236
我们吵了一架
we had a squabble.

661
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:31,476
我把他和拉蒙娜关在了一起  她把他吃了
So I chucked him in with Ramona and she ate him.

662
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:32,686
亲爱的啊
Baby.

663
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,536
你自己独自欣赏了好戏
You hate-watched without me.

664
00:38:35,826 --> 00:38:37,146
别生气
Don't be mad.

665
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:39,626
也许这周末的时候  我们可以扔点别的人进去
We can dump someone else in there, maybe this weekend.

666
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:43,186
与此同时  我需要帮我办点事
In the meantime, I need you to do something for me.

667
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:45,646
说吧
Name it.

668
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:46,976
我需要你
I need you

669
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:49,286
在威尔的尸体发臭之前
to retrieve Will's body

670
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,786
把尸体弄出来
before it gets too ripe.

671
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:54,706
我想拉蒙娜应该已经回铁笼子里去了
And I think Ramona should go back in the iron maiden.

672
00:38:57,046 --> 00:38:57,846
没问题
Sure.

673
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,346
那我帮你擦屁股的时候
And while I'm cleaning up your mess,

674
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,966
你能否也帮我处理点麻烦
maybe you can clean up mine.

675
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:05,996
什么叫你的麻烦
What did you mean "your mess"?

676
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:08,636
何不发短信给你男朋友
Why don't you text your boyfriend

677
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:10,196
问问他呢
and ask him?

678
00:39:11,136 --> 00:39:12,856
对了
Oh, oh, that's right.

679
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:15,716
他不知道怎么发短信
He doesn't know how to text.

680
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:19,996
视频聊天就更别想了
And you can forget about FaceTime.

681
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,730
门开着呢
It's open.

682
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,970
再等一下下
I just need a sec.

683
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,170
我不知道改选哪个
I wasn't sure what we-we landed on,

684
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,280
所以把选项都摆出来了
so I-I just put out a selection.

685
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,240
你随意挑吧
Help yourself.

686
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,220
天啊  你简直是个倒卖军火的
Christ, it's like you're an arms dealer.

687
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,190
好了
There.

688
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,500
天啊
God.

689
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,510
花的时间比我想的长多了
Ah, boy, it took a lot longer than I thought.

690
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,980
不过总算搞定了
But it's finally done.

691
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,880
什么东西
What is?

692
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,580
我的感谢视频
It's my tribute video.

693
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,850
我死了以后  没人会赞颂我的美德
Nobody's gonna be rushing to extol my virtues once I croak,

694
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,850
所以我决定给自己留点纪念
so I decided to immortalize myself.

695
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,550
给我点意见
Tell me what you think.

696
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,810
要说实话
And be honest.

697
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,250
{\an8}我叫艾芮斯

698
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,150
{\an8}听听我的呐喊吧

699
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,680
你是费了功夫的
You put a lot of work in this.

700
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,930
是啊
Yeah.

701
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,270
我希望我能给我的INS上三个粉丝
I just, I wanted it to be a beacon of hope

702
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,090
带去一丝希望的光
for my three followers on Instagram.

703
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,720
好了  我准备好了
Okay, I'm ready.

704
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,980
动手吧
Let's do this.

705
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,190
知道吗  我觉得
You know, I'm just thinking

706
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,400
黑猩猩那张照片应该放到彩虹前面
the chimp might go better before the rainbows.

707
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,890
放到"别丧失好奇之心"的后面
So it's over the "Never lose your sense of wonder" lyric.

708
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,160
你在拖延时间
You're stalling.

709
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,750
我的道格拉斯
My Douglas.

710
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,600
他说他希望我重回他的生活
He just told me he wants me in his life.

711
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,880
所以你不干了
So you're out.

712
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,300
如果哪天他有孩子了呢
What if one day he has kids?

713
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,450
我会是孩子的外婆  艾芮斯
I'd be a grandmother, Iris.

714
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,810
是啊  可我始终是孤零零的一个人
Yeah, well, I've lived alone all my life.

715
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,570
我爱过的每一个人都抛弃了我
Every single person I've ever loved has abandoned me,

716
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,330
你为什么就能不一样
so why should you be any different?

717
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,090
听我说  艾芮斯
Listen to me, Iris.

718
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,820
你和我
You and I

719
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,770
都是上了年纪的女人
are women of a certain age.

720
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,090
我们受过苦
We have suffered

721
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,940
都是不该受的罪
more than our fair share.

722
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,340
该死
Damn it.

723
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,710
我们才应该是这个世界的主人
We are the ones who should inherit the earth.

724
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,750
我们应该接管这个旅馆
We should freaking take over this damn hotel!

725
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,870
振兴这个地方
Spiffy it up.

726
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,660
让这里变成一个像你的彩虹视频一样
Turn it into a place with as much hope

727
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,580
充满希望的地方
as your rainbow montage.

728
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,740
就像《涉外大酒店》里的那样
Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

729
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,080
我们被赋予了第二次机会
We're entitled to a second chance.

730
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,860
光荣
A glorious,

731
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,600
闪耀的谢幕
blazing final act.

732
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,760
我的
My...

733
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,460
朋友
friend...

734
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,430
最精彩的一幕还没开始呢
the best is yet to come.

735
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,230
这样一来就没有回头路可走了
If we do this, there's no going back.

736
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,230
爸爸
Daddy.

737
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,150
霍尔登
Holden.

738
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,370
霍尔登
Holden!

739
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,440
这一刻我已经不记得等了多少年了
I can't tell you how long I've waited to do this.

740
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,720
五年了
Five years.

741
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,140
他和我记忆中的一模一样
He's exactly how I remembered him.

742
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,530
他也会一直这样
And that's exactly how he'll stay.

743
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,420
该回家了
It's time to go home.

744
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,300
约翰
John!

745
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,080
她是谁
Who's that?

746
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,600
继续走
Just keep walking.

747
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,590
我要杀了你
I'm going to kill you!

748
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,830
我发誓
I swear on my soul

749
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,150
我一定会杀了你
I'm going to kill you!

750
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,740
约翰
John...!

751
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:52,730
你没逃跑
You didn't run.

752
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,230
为什么要逃
Why would I run?

753
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,230
你一定会找到我
You'd only find me.

754
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,690
我找不到他了
I couldn't find him.

755
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,330
差不多得100年了
For almost a century.

756
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,250
我不知道他是死了
I didn't know if he was dead

757
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,640
还是抛弃了我
or had abandoned me.

758
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,200
但其实都不是
Neither of which were true,

759
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,750
因为至始至终  他就被困在这儿
because he'd been trapped here the whole time.

760
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,500
被困在这儿的不止是他
He's not the only one who's been trapped here.

761
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,340
我们都是
We all have.

762
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,570
至少现在他自由了
At least now he's free.

763
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,560
而且现在你知道了  他没有抛弃你
And this time you know he didn't abandon you.

764
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,920
这就是你想要的吗  多诺万
Is that what you want, Donovan?

765
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,770
所以你干下这样可怕的事
Is that why you did this terrible thing?

766
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,210
因为你想自由
Because you wish to be set free?

767
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,540
恐怕是的
I suppose I do.

768
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,070
我知道这意味着什么
I knew what this would mean.

769
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,560
我一看到他  就知道他意味着什么
I knew what he meant the moment I saw him.

770
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,830
他对你的意义
What he was to you.

771
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,240
是我永远做不到的
What I could never be.

772
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,940
他创造了我
He made me!

773
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:03,820
是他创造了我
He made me.

774
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,760
他造就了我的一切
He made me everything I am!

775
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,860
而你造就了我
And you made me

776
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,870
把我创造成他的样子
in his image.

777
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,010
是的
Yes, I did.

778
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,210
我努力把你变成他
I tried to.

779
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,560
我以为没有他  我会活不下去
I thought I couldn't be without him.

780
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,690
但你从来不是他
You were never him.

781
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,610
你永远成不了他
You could never be him.

782
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,200
所以你毁了他
So you destroyed him.

783
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,150
一找到机会我就这么干了
First chance I got.

784
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,610
你也知道我会回来杀你
And you knew I'd come back here to kill you.

785
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,760
是的
Yes.

786
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,060
而你毫不在乎
And you don't care.

787
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:56,800
我在乎
I do.

788
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,580
我在乎
I do care.

789
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,780
我只是不介意死
I just don't mind.

790
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,150
死亡是你让我爱你的唯一办法
Dying is the only way you'll let me love you.

791
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,280
我想不出别的办法了
I don't know how else to do it.

792
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,840
美丽的少年啊
Beautiful boy.

793
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,700
愿意牺牲一切
Willing to sacrifice everything...

794
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,090
只为了我的爱
...for the love of me.

795
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,180
我竟创造了这样美丽的生灵
What a beautiful thing I've made.
