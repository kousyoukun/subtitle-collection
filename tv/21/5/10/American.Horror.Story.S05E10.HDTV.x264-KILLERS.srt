<i>But it's all an illusion.</i>

<i>Everything new fades.</i>

00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,344

00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,932

<i>At peace, even.</i>

Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

28
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:58,464
All I can see is
eight hours of hard scrubbing

29
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,251
gonna take to get

30
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,686
the blood off these walls.

31
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,187
Why don't people
have the courtesy

32
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,956
to blow their brains out
at their own home?

33
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:07,672
What if one of the kids
found them like this?

34
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,954
Well, I don't see why
that has to be my problem.

35
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:14,232
Look at them.

36
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:23,841
Why are you crying?

37
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,377
They were happy.

38
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:30,095
I feel like
I'll never be happy again.

39
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:34,083
I pretend that I'm okay living
in a world without Tristan, but it's...

40
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,655
it's been difficult.

41
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,548
Besides,

42
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:45,174
knowing The Countess,
it's just a matter of time

43
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,544
before she slits my throat.

44
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,448
What's the point of waiting
around for someone to...

45
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:56,352
stab you in the back
when I'm already dead?

46
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,354
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Wait.

47
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,256
- Just let me do it.
- No, no.

48
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,258
- I don't want to be here.
- I know.

49
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,754
Well, you're gonna be stuck
here for all of eternity

50
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:07,196
unless you get your head
strapped on straight

51
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:08,364
before pulling that trigger.

52
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:14,170
Oh, shit.

53
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:16,205
Jesus.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,274
You know how this goes.

55
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,310
Yeah.

56
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:22,445
And I'm guessing

57
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,180
you have plenty
of unfinished business

58
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:25,214
still on your plate.

59
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:26,449
No, just one.

60
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,217
My son.

61
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:30,286
I always meant
to put that right.

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,222
Tell him I'm sorry
for leaving him.

63
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:34,357
Okay.

64
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,793
So you do that.

65
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:40,596
And that'll give me
enough time to cancel

66
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,265
my <i>Reader's Digest,</i>

67
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,434
my <i>Country Living.</i>

68
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:49,337
Then we'll be ready to go.

69
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:51,373
"We"?

70
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:54,076
You don't have to do this alone.

71
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,410
I don't understand.

72
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,412
I thought you were reborn.

73
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,283
Donovan was my one true love.

74
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,884
I thought when he brought me
back from the brink of death,

75
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:07,189
it was because he loved me.

76
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:11,060
He doesn't love me.

77
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:13,361
He never will.

78
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,333
We'll do it together then.

79
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:22,170
Make a clean exit.

Yes, dear.

82
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:30,897
The Hotel Cortez,

83
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,234
in downtown Los Angeles.

84
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:36,504
And you have the dates now.

85
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,605
That's right, dear.

86
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,608
One whole week--
your papa's treat.

87
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:43,210
What's that, um...?

88
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:47,481
He wants to know,
"Why now?"

89
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,254
Well, I'd hoped to reach
your father to ask,

90
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,923
but alas, I cannot.

91
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:57,058
I-I must away.
Bye now.

92
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,594
Really...

93
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,196
I can't thank you enough.

94
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,765
If you don't mind my asking,

95
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,035
how long has it been?

96
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,740
I haven't seen
my son in 31 years.

97
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,010
I've written letters.

98
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,280
God knows I've written checks.

99
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:23,450
The bank statement always let
me know that each one cleared.

100
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,586
I took that as...

101
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,321
a sign.

102
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,223
I must caution you.

103
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,326
You don't know exactly
the young man's aspect.

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,727
I don't follow you.

105
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,729
His worldview.

106
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,633
I-I fear you are challenging
him to be very understanding.

107
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,635
Let me stop you right there.

108
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,904
Back in my day, fairies knew

109
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,906
never to father children.

110
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,476
It would, it would only
add to the mayhem.

111
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,945
My cousin Frederick.

112
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,321
He was always getting
into his sister's

113
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,984
peignoir and stockings.

114
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,009
And-and then one day,
he found his place.

115
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:06,011
His station in life.

116
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:09,314
Took his comfort
in the sacramental vestments.

117
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:12,017
He might've become a monsignor,

118
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,120
had he not succumbed
to his appetites.

119
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:17,091
I'm not a pedophile!

120
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,056
I lost interest long ago

121
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,957
in whatever you claim to be.

122
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:23,460
No, all I know is some poor boy

123
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,329
threw a ball in the backyard,

124
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,658
and suddenly

125
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:30,867
his proud papa wasn't
there to catch it.

126
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,671
So now here comes
this same little boy

127
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,242
to visit someone he's
always longed to see.

128
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:41,178
And instead he's
going to be confronted

129
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,080
by the ghost of Theda Bara.

130
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,581
I mean, it's-it's
quite a fright indeed.

131
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:46,616
That's enough!

132
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:52,688
Anyhoo.

133
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,291
Where's that item
you promised me?

134
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,739
You haven't forgotten
your end of the bargain.

135
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,501
Have at it.

136
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:08,371
Go nuts.

137
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,107
Oh, who would have thought?

138
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:13,542
Oxygen in the soap!

139
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,177
- Yes.
- For God's sake, look.

140
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:17,112
"Radiant whites," it says.

141
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:18,947
You are an absolute marvel.

142
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,216
It's like Christmas morning.

143
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,400
Ears.

144
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:42,804
For they heard
the calling of false gods.

145
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:47,274
You're a clever man, John Lowe.

146
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,444
Empty your hearts.

147
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,314
Let the Lady of Shadows
hear your prayers.

148
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,379
Welcome to our church.

149

Is this your first time here?

150
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:05,126
Know that the old
gods are not dead.

151
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,061
They're waiting to be awakened.

152
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:09,930
What is your name?

153
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,001
I am...

154
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:15,102
death.

155
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,518
No!

156
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:34,655
One more and you'll be free.

157
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:56,208

257

I'll stand humbly

You tell me where she is

Your reunion awaits.

264
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,802
There's nothing like
the steam from a fresh pot

265
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:38,070
to loosen the phlegm
from the lungs.

266
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:41,173
Thank you.

267
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,848
You mustn't have an argument
on an empty stomach.

268
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:51,951
It upsets
the balance of the day.

271
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,193
You told me Holden was

272
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,028
a hallucination.
That was a lie.

273
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:04,964
You tried to make me think
I was going crazy.

274
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:06,966
Well, that was the truth.

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,902
You kept my son away from me.

276
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:11,237
In case you haven't noticed,

277
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:13,072
he's not the child you knew.

278
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:18,276
I made my choice
to be with Holden.

279
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,078
I didn't tell you

280
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:23,114
because I was afraid you would
say something to change my mind.

281
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,686
I don't regret my decision.

282
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,021
We have another child.

283
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,624
I haven't forgotten
about Scarlett.

284
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:43,802
All this time,

285
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:46,971
you've seen her twice.

286
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:50,041
She told me.

287
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,176
And how many times have
you been to visit Grandma?

288
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,979
No excuses.

289
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:57,481
We abandoned her.

290
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:59,450
We're the world's worst parents.

291
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:02,453
Well, at least that's one thing
we can agree on.

292
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,659
Maybe it'll be better
for Scarlett with me gone.

293
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:12,129
What's that supposed to mean?

294
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,000
We're in trouble.

295
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:19,202
I made a mistake a while ago,

296
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:22,039
and The Countess
holds me responsible.

297
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:24,107

00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:33,093

<i>and he turned the others.</i>

303
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,991
One chance to fix this problem.

304
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,060
Countess told me
she'd kill me and Holden

305
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,028
if I didn't make things right.

306
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:49,532
I know it's not your problem...

307
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,100
If it involves you and Holden,

308
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,903
it's my problem.

309
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,871
What do we have to do?

310
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,176
Tap.

311
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,511
Tap-tap-tap.

312
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:04,145
Tap-tap-tap.

313
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,915

326
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:48,088
Maybe...

something to drink?

328
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,298

00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:00,733
Call me Liz.

333
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:04,470
What's your, uh...

334
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,205
what's your line of work?

335
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,807
Uh, I work for a guy who owns

336
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,710
huge properties packed
with self-storage units

337
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,146
in and around Denver.

338
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,613
Oh.

339
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:17,083
Company makes
some serious coin...

340
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:19,285
- Oh.
- ...not that I do.

341
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:23,088
Hey, I like your dress,

342
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,789
by the way.

343
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,791
Sparkly!

344
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,493
What do you call those?

345
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:29,794
What?

346
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:32,997
Uh, the... those round things.

347
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:35,167
The... oh.

348
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,468
Paillettes.

349
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,975
And then...
then my wife insisted

350
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:45,977
that I needed to
find a new boss.

351
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,478
Or to... better yet, she said,

352
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:49,980
to be my own.

353
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:51,282
I mean...

354
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:54,185
Oh, give her a break.

355
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,787
Your bride sounds astute.

356
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:57,780
Yeah.

357
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,852
Yeah, she is.

358
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:03,627
But that doesn't make
the mortgage payment

359
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,662
any less late.

360
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:08,999
We all have dreams, you know?

361
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,768
Not meant to drop everything...

362
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:13,604
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

363
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:14,871
I disagree.

364
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:17,040
You go ahead.

365
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:20,143
You move to Boulder and
you start that kayak company.

366
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:24,147
Anyway, I'm sorry
to bend your ear.

367
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:27,283
I've always kept my own counsel,
you know?

368
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:28,815
Coming up, it was, uh...

369
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,154
just my mom and I.

370
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:34,190
Dad split.

371
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:37,160
Missed my one great season
in Pee Wee League.

372
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:42,398
I can't blame the guy.

373
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,168
I was a rambunctious kid.

374
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:48,605
Oh...

375
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,906
you shouldn't blame yourself.

376
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,908
I'm sure your father
had his reasons.

377
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,410
Well, those'll be news to me,

378
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,446
whenever I hear 'em.

379
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,416
I guess he's on my mind.

380
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:03,553
I'm in town 'cause we're...

381
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:06,122
finally gonna reconnect.

382
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:08,858
Well...

383
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:10,359
here's to that.

384
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:11,727
Yeah.

385
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,801
This, uh, next one's on me.

386
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:23,806
Nice of you.

387
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,008
Maybe another time.

388
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:27,342
I'd like that.

389
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,986
We're too late.

390
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,300
The police must have
tracked down

391
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,322
the delivery boy.

392
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,857
Kids must be long gone.

393
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,361
Maybe not.

394
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,164
Somebody's inside.

395
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:17,024
Hey.

396
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,027
Stay here.

397
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,400
Hey there.

398
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,004
What's your name?

399
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:06,205
Kimmy.

400
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,507
I want my mommy.

401
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,576
Okay, Kimmy.

402
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,211
Let's see what's
going on with you.

403
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:13,846
Get away from her!

404
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:22,554
Don't move!

405
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:26,058
You're bleeding.

406
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:27,393
I'm okay.

407
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:28,527
Yo!

408
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,062
Don't make me have to shoot you.

409
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:33,232
You don't scare me.

410
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,967
There's a lot more
of us than you.

411
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:49,114
We told you not to come back.

412
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:51,283
Kimmy!

413
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:53,118
Please.

414
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:54,653
Please, you have to help her!

415
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:57,356
Maddie! Get back.

416
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,558
You ready? Breathe for me.
Ready?

417
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,516
Come on, honey.

418
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,584
Come on, Kimmy.

419
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,585
- Fix her!
- I can't stop.

420
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:09,456
Kimmy, come on.

421
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,127
Come here.

422
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,900
Come on.

423
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,640
Why did you stop?

424
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,775
Help her!

425
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,811
It's too late for Kimmy.

426
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:33,847
Come on.

427
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,150
It doesn't have to be too late
for the rest of you.

428
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:49,891
How long has your husband been missing,
Mrs. Drake?

429
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,111
Since Wednesday evening.

430
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:55,449
Virtually the last thing
he said to me was, "I do."

431
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,096
Then I came up here to change

432
00:23:58,216 --> 00:23:59,239
and finish packing.

433
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:04,051
He was going to the bar
for a drink.

434
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:07,255
That's the last
I heard from him.

435
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,784
I wouldn't panic yet,
Mrs. Drake.

436
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:12,408
Some grooms, um,
they get cold feet

437
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:14,992
after the ceremony
instead of before.

438
00:24:15,027 --> 00:24:17,762
Oh, you don't know my husband.

439
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:20,765
He's a very responsible
human being.

440
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,068
He would never abandon
his new bride

441
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:26,171
or his young son this way.

442
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:28,502
Something must have happened.

443
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,209
Darling, I wasn't aware
we had visitors.

444
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:34,211
I'm Will Drake.

445
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,980
Dearest.

446
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:40,417
Sir, your wife was under the
impression you'd gone missing.

447
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:41,951
"Missing"?

448
00:24:41,986 --> 00:24:43,753
No.

449
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:46,256
No, I was just exploring the new
renovation on the seventh floor

450
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,059
and got lost in the
hallways for two days.

451
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:51,449
I'd love to show it to you.

452
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:53,718
My wife designed it herself.
Oh, we couldn't possibly waste

453
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:55,720
You really should see what's in there.
these officers' time any longer.

454
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:57,392
I am so sorry...

455
00:24:57,512 --> 00:25:00,724
for how I've inconvenienced you.

456
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,726
I was... confused.

457
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:04,529
Yeah.

458
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:07,565
Well, we're just glad
everything turned out okay.

459
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,601
A happy ending
without all the tugging

460
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,270
and the pushing and...

461
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,571
Thank you.
Thank you again.

462
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:19,877
You murdered me, you bitch.

463
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:20,941
Oh, get over it.

464
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,723
You pissed me off.

465
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:26,216
You made disparaging remarks
about Bartholomew.

466
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,017
That I cannot abide.

467
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:29,786
Bullshit.

468
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,821
This was your plan all along.

469
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:35,625
So what happens now?

470
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,295
My body turns up
in some filthy alleyway?

471
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,962
You take control of my empire?

472
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:43,733
I thought I'd dissolve
the empire, convert it to cash.

473
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:47,637
Well, you forget.

474
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,472
You're not in the will.

475
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,678
No, you forget.

476
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:56,713
Lachlan inherits everything.

477
00:26:06,757 --> 00:26:10,026
And you made me his legally
appointed guardian.

478
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,029
I'll be guiding him.

479
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:15,231
Only until he reaches
his majority.

480
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:17,767
Assuming he ever does.

481
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:24,740
Are you threatening my son?

482
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:27,776
I don't kill children, but I
could make him a blood relative.

483
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:32,814
You mean like that woman who
sucked me dry in the hallway.

484
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:37,586
You're a lot smarter dead
than you ever were alive.

485
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,622
Try and keep it that way.

486
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,660
Why don't you go visit our son?

487
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:47,195
We wouldn't want
anything to upset him.

488
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,199
Tell him we decided not
to honeymoon in Paris after all.

489
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,937
I advised you not to kill
him on the premises.

490
00:26:55,972 --> 00:26:57,973
Bite me.

491
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:36,844
There's a room at
the end of the hall.

492
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:37,979
It's ready for you.

493
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,260
I'm gonna try and find you
something or someone to eat.

494
00:27:40,355 --> 00:27:41,555
You must be starving.

495
00:27:42,316 --> 00:27:45,218
We can wait out here
till you get back.

496
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:46,352
I'll just be a sec.

497
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:54,961
Okay.

498
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:56,229
Come on.

499
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,150
Go on in.

500
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:18,751
Your friends are
waiting for you.

501
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:22,459
I don't want to.

502
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,224
Let's go.

503
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,893
- No!
- No!

504
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:30,896
No!

505
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,132
Help! Open up! Open it!

506
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:41,006
Let us out!
Open up!

507
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:43,909
Max!

508
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:47,747
I told you, we should have
never trusted that bitch!

509
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:49,682
Shut up!

510
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:24,983
Mama... smells appetizers.

511
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:32,864
*** move like a teenager

512
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,166
that's about to get caught?

513
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,538
We're getting a divorce.

514
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,288
We're not supposed to
be sleeping together.

515
00:29:39,322 --> 00:29:41,323
Who says we have
to go through with it?

516
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:45,661
I do.

517
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:50,165
Has anything really changed
since I gave you the papers?

518
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:52,167
Everything.

519
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:53,736
You found Holden.

520
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,771
You are different, aren't you?

521
00:29:57,841 --> 00:30:00,175
Something solid
behind your eyes.

522
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:04,947
You're all there.

523
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:09,518
Finally got it together, John.

524
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:23,198
I can't.

525
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,001
I have to process this.

526
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:29,037
And I have to check on
Holden and the kids.

527
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:36,044
I am interested
in this new John, though.

528
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:50,658
Did you come inside her,

529
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:53,227
or did you shoot on her tits
like you do with me?

530
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,000
Sally.

531
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:01,536
With the whore,
it's always on the tits.

532
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,308
That's what I am to you.

533
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:10,111
A whore.

534
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:11,913
You're wrong.

535
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:13,915
It's not like that.

536
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:15,717
I told you what you meant to me.

537
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,389
Yeah.

538
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:21,255
You told me you loved me.

539
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:23,357
And don't you dare deny it.

540
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,776
I'm not a liar.

541
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,128
I have loved you.

542
00:31:27,162 --> 00:31:31,432
But what we have is
an addict's high.

543
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:35,936
In the moment, it seems
like it's never ending.

544
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,638
But it always ends.

545
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:41,142
Oh, no.

546
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:43,977
Oh, no, baby.

547
00:31:44,012 --> 00:31:47,581
There will never be
anyone like me.

548
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:50,518
John...

549
00:31:50,552 --> 00:31:53,587
you can't tell me that
this isn't what you want.

550
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,644
No.

551
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,447
- Come on.
- No.

552
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,487
Alex is not the answer.

553
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:32,792
She doesn't know about you.

554
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,827
Not the way I do.

555
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:41,467
How's she gonna take it
when she finds out the truth?

556
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:47,372
That you're a serial killer.

557
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,642
You think she'll take you back?

558
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,813
Accept you the way I do?

559
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,327
No, I have to try.

560
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,596
For Scarlett and for Holden.

561
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,132
Bullshit.

562
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,227
This is for you.

563
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,640
It's for you.

564
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:24,071
You're right.

565
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:27,261
If I'm being honest with myself.

566
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,755
She left you.

567
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,258
She lied to you.

568
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:43,561
She wanted you out of her life.

569
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:46,631
I was there for five years.

570
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:07,718
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:13,290
I deserve more than this!

572
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,706
Stay away from me.

573
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,974
You'll be back, asshole!

574
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:34,476
She'll leave you
once she learns what you are.

575
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:37,313
She'll leave you,
or maybe I'll kill that bitch!

576
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,921
Oh, it's the most
beautiful thing

577
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:47,456
I have ever laid eyes on.

578
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,359
Oh, thank you, thank you.

579
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:53,820
Oh, oh, how-how...
how do I use it again?

580
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:59,235
Uh, okay, you press
this once for cold.

581
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,525
And twice for hot.

582
00:35:01,645 --> 00:35:04,607
And there's even a separate
setting for delicates.

583
00:35:06,643 --> 00:35:07,976
Oh, and no more wringing.

584
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,478
No more wringing.

585
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:11,247
Oh, heavenly day.

586
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:14,750
Thank you for helping me
reconnect with my son

587
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:17,602
and for giving him
such excellent turndown service.

588
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:20,322
So... good to go?

589
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:21,725
Oh, yeah, I think so.

590
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:25,627
Um, have we settled on a method?

591
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:28,630
Pills? Gun? Knife?

592
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:31,633
Oh, Queen of the Nile,
I must tell you.

593
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,902
Your son has been perched in the
Blue Parrot for quite a while.

594
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:37,472
Would you like me to tell him
that you will not be back?

595
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:40,275
- Because you're doing yourself in?
- Shit.

596
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:41,709
Mainly wanted a moment
of your time.

597
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:43,711
Okay.

598
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:45,513
Really?

599
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:47,214
I just wanted
to tell you something.

600
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:51,752
Janice and I are
Boulder-bound.

601
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,052
Well, cheers to that.

602
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,789
Thanks for the push
in the right direction.

603
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,026
I have something to tell you.

604
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:06,132
And... it's...
rather difficult.

605
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:09,035
Um...

606
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:13,840
Hey... Dad.

607
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:16,976
It's not difficult.

608
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:21,648
Or... it doesn't have to be.

609
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,820
Mom gave me a few clues.

610
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,789
I put them together.

611
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,291
She warned me

612
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:33,893
that I wouldn't recognize you,
but I-I did.

613
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:36,529
I mean, I do.

614
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:41,701
I don't recognize myself in you.

615
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:47,740
How did I get so lucky
to raise a child

616
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:50,676
so...

617
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,979
compassionate?

618
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:54,547
Mom raised me.

619
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:56,082
You left.

620
00:36:57,974 --> 00:36:59,151
That hurt.

621
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,388
And maybe that's what...

622
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:07,526
...makes me see
when other people are all...

623
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,295
messed up inside.

624
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,532
Plus, Janice hears me, you know?

625
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:17,370
Even when I don't even
know what I mean.

626
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,777
And I told her

627
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:28,547
that I was gonna
make things good tonight.

628
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:31,884
And she's happy for us both.

629
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,919
You have no problem
with the fact

630
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:37,054
that your father is a woman?

631
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,640
I really learned something
when Pedro died...

632
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,794
...on <i>The Real World.</i>

633
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,963
Sorry.

634
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:49,000
And I kept learning.

635
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,738
Plenty of time
to talk it out, Liz.

636
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,941
But, hey,

637
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,176
there's plenty of room

638
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,613
for another woman in my life.

639
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,617
Okay.

640
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:10,888
My goodness,
I do love watching you

641
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,423
work with a knife.

642
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,193
I was a little surprised
to get your call.

643
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,062
I figured you'd be in Paris,

644
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,798
murdering your husband

645
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,357
and dumping his body
in the Seine.

646
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:25,302
I did a rather stupid thing,
I suppose.

647
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,438
Felt great at the time,
but now I have

648
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,005
a bit of a mess to deal with.

649
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,309
Oh, I know just what you mean.

650
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,079
Before we could leave
for our honeymoon,

651
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,814
we had a squabble.

652
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,950
So I chucked him in
with Ramona and she ate him.

653
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:42,852
Baby.

654
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,854
You hate-watched
without me.

655
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:46,689
Don't be mad.

656
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:49,058
We can dump someone else
in there, maybe this weekend.

657
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:52,798
In the meantime, I need you
to do something for me.

658
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,997
Name it.

659
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,999
I need you

660
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,835
to retrieve Will's body

661
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,636
before it gets too ripe.

662
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,073
And I think Ramona should
go back in the iron maiden.

663
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,775
Hmm.

664
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,510
Sure.

665
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,279
And while I'm cleaning up
your mess,

666
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,014
maybe you can clean up mine.

667
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:15,084
What did you mean "your mess"?

668
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:17,919
Why don't you text
your boyfriend

669
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:20,479
and ask him?

670
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,791
Oh, oh, that's right.

671
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:24,993
He doesn't know how to text.

672
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:29,297
And you can forget
about FaceTime.

673
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:34,391
It's open.

674
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:38,295
I just need a sec.

675
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,580
I wasn't sure what
we-we landed on,

676
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,466
so I-I just put out a selection.

677
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,513
Help yourself.

678
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:46,541
Christ, it's like
you're an arms dealer.

679
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:50,707
There.

680
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:52,475
God.

681
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:54,711
Ah, boy, it took a lot
longer than I thought.

682
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,379
But it's finally done.

683
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,814
What is?

684
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:00,650
It's my tribute video.

685
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:04,287
Nobody's gonna be rushing to
extol my virtues once I croak,

686
00:41:04,322 --> 00:41:08,258
so I decided to
immortalize myself.

You know, I'm just thinking

the chimp might go better
before the rainbows.

702

You're stalling.

He just told me
he wants me in his life.

So you're out.

707

What if one day he has kids?

708
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,364
I'd be a grandmother, Iris.

Yeah, well, I've lived
alone all my life.

Every single person
I've ever loved

711
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,335
has abandoned me,

712
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:29,370
so why should you be
any different?

713
00:42:38,046 --> 00:42:39,480
Listen to me, Iris.

714
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:41,281
You and I

715
00:42:41,316 --> 00:42:43,016
are women of a certain age.

716
00:42:43,136 --> 00:42:44,885
We have suffered

717
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,417
more than our fair share.

718
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,024
Damn it.

719
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:51,725
We are the ones
who should inherit the earth.

720
00:42:55,396 --> 00:42:57,998
We should freaking
take over this damn hotel!

721
00:42:58,032 --> 00:42:59,333
Spiffy it up.

722
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:00,968
Turn it into a place
with as much hope

723
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:03,776
as your rainbow montage.

724

Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

725

We're entitled
to a second chance.

726

A glorious,

I've waited to do this.

736

Five years.

Yeah.

how I remembered him.
