你真该看看他们的工作室

5
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:19,206
我希望这成为自己的工作室
I want mine to be right here.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,741
这地方给我灵感
This place inspires me.

7
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:21,742
你能接受吗
Is that okay with you?

00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:22,743
可以
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:24,077
我交了新朋友
I made some friends.

10
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:27,748
如果我告诉你
What would you think if I told you

我和金发女友要一直交往下去

德雷克先生
Mr. Drake.

17
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,326
我们有麻烦了
I think we've got a problem.

18
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,729
这钢板一英寸厚
It's one-inch steel.

19
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,498
堵住了这个区域
It runs the whole length of this section.

20
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:50,799
图纸上并没有它
It's not in any of the plans.

21
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:51,800
拆掉它
Tear it out.

22
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:52,834
我有计划
I'm on a schedule.

23
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:02,573
闻起来像屎一样
It smells like shit in there.

24
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:04,056
不 像死亡的气味
No, it smells like death.

25
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:29,303
我不想继续往前了
I don't think we should go down there.

26
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:30,804
是啊 死亡的气味
"Eh, it smells like death."

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,900
别怕 胆小鬼
Come on, you pussy.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,869
这里封闭很久了
This place has been sealed up for years.

29
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:58,150


30
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,397
你知道你是谁吗
Do you know who you are?

31
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:04,369
加州
California.

32
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,404
哪家医院
Which hospital?

33
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:11,375
洛先生 你在西洛杉矶健康中心
Mr. Lowe, you're at the West Los Angeles Health Center.

34
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,311
我要问你几个问题
I'd like to ask you some questions

35
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:16,113
从而判断你的精神状态
to determine your state of mind.

36
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:20,651
你能每隔7个数从100开始倒数吗
Could you start by counting backwards from 100 by sevens?

37
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:23,654
嗯 93
Uh, 93...

38
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,657
86
86...

39
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:28,692
7... 79
seventy... seventy-nine....

40
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,930
呃 我刚说到哪了

告诉我你怎样形容
Tell me which statement most accurately describes

42
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:36,933
现在的精神状态
what you're feeling.

43
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,704
"我对未来有信心"
"I am not discouraged about my future."

44
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,935
你确定要留在这吗
Are you sure you want to stay here?

45
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,006
我是说 约翰 比这好的地方还很多
I mean, there are more comfortable places, John.

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,242
我能安排你去雷斯尼克
I could get you into Resnick.

47
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,744
这里够好了
This is perfect for me.

48
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:02,818
用你自己的话说说为什么会来这
In your own words, can you tell me why you're here?

49
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:07,188
我 呃 似乎任何事都不顺我意
I, um, feel like everything's closing in on me.

50
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:11,192
工作受挫
Some setbacks at work.

51
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:13,567
和妻子分开
Separation from my wife.

52
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:19,734
而且因为误解
Because of a misunderstanding,

53
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:21,769
女儿不敢见我
my daughter is afraid of me.

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,140
我需要专业的帮助
I need professional help.

55
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,945
我觉得这是很重要的陈述
I think that's a very important statement.

56
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,447
你认识到自己的弱点

57
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,016
并采取积极措施补救

58
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,216
有什么特别事件
Was there a specific incident

59
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,918
触发你寻医的欲望
that prompted this latest episode?

60
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:40,021
当时我在处理一件令人沮丧的案件
I've been working on a very frustrating case.

61
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,926
凶手犯下谋杀案但逍遥法外
There's a killer out there, murdering with impunity,

62
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:45,959
他将摩西十诫作为杀人理由
using the Ten Commandments as justification.

63
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:49,462
嘿 死脑筋 你现在是停职处分
Hey, dickhead, you're on administrative leave.

64
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:52,065
如果队长看到你在这 就等着被开除吧
Captain sees you here, you won't even get your old job back.

65
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,933
嫌疑人是谁
Who's the suspect?

66
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,869
我再也不会包庇你了
I'm not covering for you anymore.

67
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:57,937
我要和他谈谈
I want to talk to him.

68
00:04:57,972 --> 00:05:00,273
他在哪
Where is he?

69
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:06,611
我攻击了唯一的朋友
I attacked the only friend I had.

70
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,916
唯一愿意帮助我的人
The one person who was trying to help me.

71
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,919
那时你意识到自己需要帮助
And that's when you finally realized you needed help.

72
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:15,453
冷静下来
Get some fresh air.

73
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,422
你给我滚出去 混蛋
You better be out of here, asshole!

74
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:21,493
好的 我会走
Okay, I'm going.

75
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:29,902
我觉得是时候寻求治疗了
I knew it was time I checked into a hospital.

76
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:32,937
我们会帮助你的 约翰
We'll get a handle on this, John.

77
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,034
这是个很好的开端
This is a good first step.

78
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:42,180
我觉得这里很适合我
I feel I'm exactly where I need to be.

79
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:49,454
德雷克先生知道这事吗
Does Mr. Drake know about this?

80
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:50,955
呃 我觉得不知道
Um, I don't think so.

81
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:52,724
他正忙着给自己的肛门
He's, um, he's in the middle

82
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:55,159
剃毛 漂白
of getting his anus waxed and bleached.

83
00:05:55,194 --> 00:05:57,589
现在这算是正事吗
Is that a thing now?

84
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,097
我是说 怎么会有人知道
I mean, how would someone even know

85
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:00,631
自己的肛门需要漂白呢
their anus needs bleaching?

86
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,666
我可不愿让屁眼抛头露面
I couldn't pick my butthole out of a lineup.

87
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,506
谁干的
Who did this?

88
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,308
别是新来的女家教
Not the new governess.

89
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:12,844
不是
No.

90
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,311
你看他们
I mean, look at 'em.

91
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,981
不管是谁肯定饿坏了
Whoever did this was starving.

92
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,950
里面有什么
What was in here?

93
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:20,651
我不知道
I don't know.

94
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,216
怎么
What?

95
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:29,160
我从没见这样你害怕过
I've just never seen you scared before.

96
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:43,706
我说服他接受这个实惠的交易
I convinced him I got him a fantastic deal,

97
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:47,510
所以他准我一个周末的假
so he threw a free weekend on top of my commission.

98
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,814
别告诉他我伪造了文件
Don't tell him that I fudged the paperwork

99
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:53,302
从而看起来像是有许多人出价
to make it look like he had multiple offers.

100
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:54,978
哦 亲爱的
Oh, honey.

101
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:56,953
我宁愿一个人
I'd rather be alone.

102
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:59,555
你知道的 自从我除掉哈莉

一直经受悲伤的折磨
I go through these spasms of grief.

104

以牙还牙
A tooth for a tooth!

111
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,961

他妻子也不是兰波娃
