1
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,416
So we're really gonna stay.

2
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,953
Well, you know
what Paris does to me.

3
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:16,220
Dior, Lagerfeld.

4
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:18,022
You should see their ateliers.

5
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:19,556
I want mine to be right here.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,091
This place inspires me.

7
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:22,092
Is that okay with you?

8
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,093
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:24,427
I made some friends.

10
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:28,098
What would you think
if I told you

11
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:30,067
that me and my blonde
lady friend are gonna

12
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:31,301
be together forever?

13
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:32,903
I thought you liked men?

14
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,070
Well, adults are complicated.

15
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,105
Then I approve.

16
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,842
Mr. Drake.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,676
I think we've got a problem.

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,079
It's one-inch steel.

19
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:49,848
It runs the whole length
of this section.

20
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:51,149
It's not in any of the plans.

21
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:52,150
Tear it out.

22
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:53,184
I'm on a schedule.

23
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,923
It smells like shit in there.

24
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,406
No, it smells like death.

25
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,653
I don't think we
should go down there.

26
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,154
"Eh, it smells like death."

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,250
Come on, you pussy.

28
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,219
This place has been
sealed up for years.

29
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:58,500
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

30
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:01,747
Do you know who you are?

31
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,719
California.

32
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:06,754
Which hospital?

33
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:11,725
Mr. Lowe, you're at the West
Los Angeles Health Center.

34
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,661
I'd like to ask
you some questions

35
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,463
to determine your state of mind.

36
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:21,001
Could you start by counting
backwards from 100 by sevens?

37
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,004
Uh, 93...

38
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,007
86...

39
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,042
seventy... seventy-nine....

40
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:33,280
Uh, what was
the last one I said?

41
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:36,082
Tell me which statement
most accurately describes

42
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,283
what you're feeling.

43
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,054
"I am not discouraged
about my future."

44
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,060
Are you sure you want
to stay here?

45
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:52,131
I mean, there are
more comfortable places, John.

46
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,367
I could get you into Resnick.

47
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,869
This is perfect for me.

48
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,943
In your own words,
can you tell me why you're here?

49
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:08,313
I, um, feel like everything's
closing in on me.

50
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,317
Some setbacks at work.

51
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:14,692
Separation from my wife.

52
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,859
Because of a misunderstanding,

53
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,894
my daughter is afraid of me.

54
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,265
I need professional help.

55
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,070
I think that's a very
important statement.

56
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,572
The fact that you recognized
your own fragility

57
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,141
and took positive action.

58
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,341
Was there a specific incident

59
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,043
that prompted
this latest episode?

60
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,146
<i>I've been working</i>
<i>on a very frustrating case.</i>

61
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,051
<i>There's a killer out there,</i>
<i>murdering with impunity,</i>

62
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:47,084
<i>using the Ten Commandments</i>
<i>as justification.</i>

63
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:50,587
Hey, dickhead, you're
on administrative leave.

64
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,190
Captain sees you here, you won't
even get your old job back.

65
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:55,058
Who's the suspect?

66
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:56,994
I'm not covering
for you anymore.

67
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:59,062
I want to talk to him.

68
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,398
Where is he?

69
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,736
I attacked
the only friend I had.

70
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,041
The one person who was
trying to help me.

71
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:15,044
And that's when you finally
realized you needed help.

72
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:16,578
Get some fresh air.

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,547
You better be
out of here, asshole!

74
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:22,618
Okay, I'm going.

75
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:31,027
I knew it was time
I checked into a hospital.

76
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:34,062
We'll get a handle
on this, John.

77
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,159
This is a good first step.

78
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:43,305
I feel I'm exactly
where I need to be.

79
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:50,579
Does Mr. Drake
know about this?

80
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,080
Um, I don't think so.

81
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:53,849
He's, um, he's in the middle

82
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:56,284
of getting his anus
waxed and bleached.

83
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,714
Is that a thing now?

84
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,222
I mean, how would
someone even know

85
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,756
their anus needs bleaching?

86
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,791
I couldn't pick my butthole
out of a lineup.

87
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,631
Who did this?

88
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,433
Not the new governess.

89
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:13,969
No.

90
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:15,436
I mean, look at 'em.

91
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:18,106
Whoever did this was starving.

92
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,075
What was in here?

93
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:21,776
I don't know.

94
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:26,341
What?

95
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:30,285
I've just never seen
you scared before.

96
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:44,831
I convinced him I got him
a fantastic deal,

97
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:48,635
so he threw a free weekend
on top of my commission.

98
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:51,939
Don't tell him that
I fudged the paperwork

99
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:54,427
to make it look like
he had multiple offers.

100
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,103
Oh, honey.

101
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:58,078
I'd rather be alone.

102
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,680
You know, ever since
I had to put Hallie down,

103
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:03,249
I go through
these spasms of grief.

104
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,060
Oh, there's the room service.

105
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,186
Bye, Margaret.

106
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:10,138
I hate that bitch.

107
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:14,477
All right! I'm coming.
For God's sake...

108
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:18,180
Aah!

109
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:27,115
An eye for an eye.

110
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,383
A tooth for a tooth!

111
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:31,086
That is the law of my father!

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,355
You belong to the sheik!

113
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,357
And cut. Good,
let's do one more.

114
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:40,529
My God, he is

115
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,865
so beautiful.

116
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,365
My boyfriend says he's queer.

117
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,602
Gibby. He's married

118
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,637
to Natacha Rambova,

119
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:52,031
one of the most exotic
women in the whole world.

120
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:55,176
They're getting a divorce.
Don't you read <i>Picture Play?</i>

121
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,678
And her name's not Rambova.

122
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:58,479
It's Winifred Hudnut.

123
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:00,114
And she's from Utah.

124
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,249
So what?
That just

125
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,848
makes me admire her more.

126
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:07,188
- She transformed herself.
- The only thing she transformed is his career.

127
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,224
She ruined it.

128
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,427
Okay, people.
Slavers and harem concubines--

129
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:16,263
you're up.

130
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:19,021
This is for you.
From him.

131
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,259
Bellissima. Mm.

132
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,900
You came.

133
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,869
Please.

134
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,374
I am so pleased you agreed to join me.

135
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,876
You see, I...

136
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,612
I often must dine alone.

137
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,047
- You?
- Mm.

138
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,381
That's hard to believe.

139
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,317
Well, it's not simple
for me, you know?

140
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,219
Fame is its own kind

141
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,255
of, uh, prison.

142
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,558
Please.

143
00:09:27,377 --> 00:09:30,616
_

144
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,336
It's a wonderful face.

145
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,073
You speak Italian!

146
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,907
Well, I understand it, anyway.

147
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,542
I'm from Bensonhurst.

148
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,678
Italian's all my folks talked

149
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:43,313
when I was growing up.
Pop's from Sicily.

150
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:44,715
- He's a plumber.
- Mm.

151
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,391
And you have come to Hollywood

152
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,787
with dreams of becoming
an actress.

153
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,559
That is unfortunate.

154
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:59,329
I think I see
greater things in you.

155
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:04,801
Greater than being immortal?

156
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:08,337
'Cause that's what it means
to be up on that screen.

157
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,607
Shadows only.

158
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:14,310
A hundred years and no one

159
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,477
will remember what we did.

160
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:16,813
No, I don't agree.

161
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,449
I don't agree at all.

162
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:24,286
I think the flickers
are the future.

163
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:27,289
A true American art form.

164
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:33,562
<i>You</i> are a true
American art form.

165
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,231
Are you making fun of me?

166
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:38,066
No, no, no, little one.

167
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:41,237
I am, uh... admiring you.

168
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,004
I'm sorry. If it
seems otherwise,

169
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,806
it is only because...

170
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:48,244
my English is not so good, huh?

171
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:01,457
I do better

172
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:02,625
without words.

173
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:08,563
Mm.

174
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,640
So...

175
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:56,742
this is the mouse.

176
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,512
Oh, my God, you're...

177
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:01,080
The cat...

178
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:02,682
little mouse.

179
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:04,951
This is
my wife, Natacha.

180
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:07,817
Rambova.

181
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,224
I am... so sorry, I thought...

182
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,226
That I was divorcing my husband.

183
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,528
And so I am.

184
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,131
I sh...should go.

185
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:22,088
No, no, no.
Please, not yet, huh?

186
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:23,928
Stay.

187
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:27,039
Natacha...

188
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:29,741
you must be gentle
with our guest, huh?

189
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,178
The divorce is for show.

190
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:35,413
The studio has been trying to...

191
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,414
tear us apart for years.

192
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:38,850
We have decided the only way

193
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,085
we can really be
together is if...

194
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:43,754
the world thinks we are not.

195
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:46,190
I don't understand.

196
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,492
Why am I here?

197
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,228
Because, little mouse...

198
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,965
...gods have appetites.

199
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:57,125
I hear he's not only
rich, but single

200
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,761
and handsome, so far as that goes.

201
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:02,531
How'd you meet this guy, anyway?
I haven't met him yet.

202
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,599
There isn't a flapper in this
city who hasn't been invited

203
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,935
to one of his private wingdings.
You'd know that

204
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:09,837
if you hadn't been
out of circulation all summer.

205
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,672
I've been around.

206
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,141
Uh-huh.

207
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:20,248
Okay, I can't take it anymore.

208
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,483
So spill-- who have
you been seeing?

209
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,320
Nobody.

210
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,250
Lies. You can't
fool me.

211
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,886
You're in love, aren't you?

212
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:35,792
I'd like to welcome you all
to the opening week

213
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:38,862
of the Hotel Cortez!

214
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,196
A shame we can't all

215
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,698
enjoy these libations

216
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:45,068
in my new
Blue Parrot Lounge, <i>but...</i>

217
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:48,504
until someone with <i>some</i> sense
repeals that nasty

218
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,173
Volstead Act,

219
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:53,008
both I and Mr. Capone

220
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,844
will have to make due.

221
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,884
Ah!

222
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,056
He's dead!

223
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,857
Valentino's dead.

224
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,060
He died in New York
this morning.

225
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:13,361
And his movie just came out.

226
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:16,431
Bet the box office goes
through the roof.

227
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,569
Your heart's beating
like a hummingbird.

228
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:57,638
Let me go!

229
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,444
No. I don't suppose I will.

230
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:08,049
Shh...

231
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:19,025
In fact...

232
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,528
I may never let you go.

233
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:37,421
It's just so...
tragic.

234
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,423
I guess we missed her.

235
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,925
Who?

236
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,492
The Lady in Black.

237
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,995
She's been coming here
for months every day

238
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,996
and leaving a single red rose.

239
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,998
I thought that was a myth.

240
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:50,701
No, it's true.

241
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,203
It says so right here.

242
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:57,974
"Rumors have sprung up
of a mysterious figure

243
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,810
"visiting Valentino's tomb.

244
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:02,779
"The Lady In Black
has left a single red rose

245
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,415
"next to the Great Lover's
final resting place

246
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,251
"each day
since his death last August.

247
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:12,421
"Some say the veiled figure
is movie actress Pola Negri,

248
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,991
who famously collapsed
at Valentino's funeral."

249
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,426
Harlot.
She never loved him.

250
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:21,831
"Others believed the wordless
visitor is something else...

251
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:25,168
something not of this Earth."

252
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,837
Well, they'll print
anything to sell magazines.

253
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:31,241
Uh... ladies?

254
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,583
Maybe we should give
her her privacy.

255
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,117
Uh-huh.

256
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:57,600
Why do you weep so,

257
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,668
little mouse?

258
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,372
Natacha.
Where have <i>you</i> been?

259
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,207
Here and there.

260
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:08,877
I wrote to you, so many times--
I never heard back.

261
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:12,014
You didn't even come
to his funeral.

262
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:15,517
Why would I go to the funeral
of a man who isn't dead?

263
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:24,492
Bellisima.

264
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,301
It can't be true.

265
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:34,902
You died.

266
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:36,703
And am...

267
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,940
reborn.

268
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:41,442
The body in that crypt
isn't Rudy.

269
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:44,745
It's my stunt double,
George Fiske.

270
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:47,634
- Always so loyal.
- Even in death.

271
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,951
Though to be clear,
I did do most of my own stunts.

272
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:51,319
Just not this one.

273
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,920
You faked your death?!

274
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:54,822
I loved you both.

275
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,991
And you just let me
think the worst?

276
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:58,392
I almost didn't survive it.

277
00:18:58,427 --> 00:18:59,593
But you did survive.

278
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:01,562
And in some style.

279
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:04,764
Congratulations on the
nuptials, by the way.

280
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,300
That was quick.

281
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,702
What did you expect?

282
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:12,738
<i>I was all alone in the world.</i>

283
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:15,160
<i>I decided that</i>

284
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,543
<i>if I was to live in grief,</i>

285
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:19,145
<i>I might as well...</i>

286
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,248
<i>be surrounded by...</i>

287
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:23,816
<i>beautiful things.</i>

288
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,321
<i>Even if it was with a man</i>

289
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:32,091
<i>for whom I felt... nothing.</i>

290
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,827
<i>I</i> was <i>drawn to the darkness</i>
<i>I felt within him,</i>

291
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,798
<i>I ached...</i>

292
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:40,500
<i>to be...</i>

293
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:43,302
<i>consumed by it.</i>

294
00:19:43,336 --> 00:19:45,337
Darling...

295
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,774
you are a revelation.

296
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,946
<i>He uncovered in me</i>

297
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,149
<i>things I never thought possible.</i>

298
00:19:58,385 --> 00:20:00,185
Uh...

299
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,822
Who is he?

300
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,026
Just a hobo.

301
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:11,696
You disapprove?

302
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:15,600
I do.

303
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,672
Why waste your time killing
some destitute beggar?

304
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:21,873
What's to be gained?

305
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:24,776
Select a victim with
money or jewels.

306
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,620
Then your little hobby
can benefit us both.

307
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,415
And next time...

308
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:34,385
...I want to watch.

309
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,620
You have suffered too much.

310
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,725
I don't suffer.

311
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:46,297
- Not anymore.
- Your tears tell me otherwise.

312
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,131
I feel nothing.

313
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,804
We never meant to leave you
this way, little one.

314
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,577
Then why did you?

315
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:02,079
<i>Fate intervened.</i>

316
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:03,714
<i>I was travelling the country,</i>

317
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:05,849
<i>promoting</i> Son of the Sheik.

318
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:08,085
<i>Booked</i>
<i>on the</i> 20th Century Limited,

319
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,454
<i>the tour would take me</i>
<i>from San Francisco to New York,</i>

320
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,756
<i>with press stops</i>
<i>all along the way.</i>

321
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:18,327
<i>At each stop, I began</i>
<i>to notice a man. At first,</i>

322
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,896
<i>I thought he was a member</i>
<i>of the press,</i>

323
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,664
<i>but he never asked</i>
<i>any questions,</i>

324
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:24,667
<i>never wrote anything down.</i>
<i>He just watched me,</i>

325
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:27,070
<i>his eyes never leaving me.</i>

326
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:28,344
<i>This was not unusual, of course.</i>

327
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,339
<i>But something in those eyes...</i>

328
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,775
<i>mesmerizing.</i>

329
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:37,479
<i>Again on the train,</i>
<i>I began to feel a presence</i>

330
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,948
<i>which raised the hairs</i>
<i>on the back of my neck.</i>

331
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,754
<i>I imagined I was seeing him</i>

332
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,489
<i>all throughout the train.</i>

333
00:21:50,037 --> 00:21:52,529
<i>I began to doubt my senses.</i>

334
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,212
A feeling of dread hung over me
<i>like a shroud.</i>

335
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:58,666
<i>And somewhere,</i>

336
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,268
<i>along an endless expanse</i>
<i>of Midwest plains,</i>

337
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:06,907
<i>I woke from a dreamless sleep</i>
<i>into a dream itself.</i>

338
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:11,846
<i>It was a seduction, but</i>
<i>mere carnality was not his aim.</i>

339
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,949
<i>I was repelled and drawn in</i>
<i>all at once.</i>

340
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:17,018
<i>When he spoke, it was in Italian</i>

341
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:19,586
but with a thick German accent.

342
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:23,357
<i>He revealed to me his name,</i>
<i>F.W. Murnau,</i>

343
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:26,627
<i>the great German director.</i>

344
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,629
What did he want from you?

345
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:31,531
I thought he meant to kill me.

346
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:34,801
But instead he wished
to preserve me.

347
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:36,402
I don't understand.

348
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:38,204
Neither did I, at first.

349
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:40,907
The great director
had uncovered many secrets

350
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:44,844
in the making
of his masterpiece, <i>Nosferatu.</i>

351
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,147
To make his picture,
he travelled deep

352
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:49,849
into the Carpathian Mountains.

353
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:52,218
He demanded authenticity,

354
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:56,155
and that is what he found
in that Old World.

355
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:59,391
<i>Creatures like the one</i>
<i>he was depicting onscreen,</i>

356
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,294
<i>though not hideous</i>
<i>like his star, Max Schreck,</i>

357
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:05,130
<i>but beautiful beyond compare.</i>

358
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:07,866
<i>Infected</i>
<i>with an ancient blood virus,</i>

359
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:11,170
<i>the consequence of which</i>
<i>was eternal life,</i>

360
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:13,171
<i>endless youth.</i>

361
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:16,508
<i>But also a terrible thirst.</i>

362
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:19,377
<i>He was telling me all this,</i>
<i>he said, as a prelude,</i>

363
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:23,515
<i>a prelude to a warning</i>
<i>and the offer of a gift.</i>

364
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:27,719
<i>Murnau lamented to me</i>
<i>what he foresees,</i>

365
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:29,987
the coming of talking pictures.

366
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:33,592
<i>And with that,</i>
<i>the death of the gods.</i>

367
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:38,029
<i>Within a year, no more,</i>
<i>our world would be gone.</i>

368
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,965
<i>He couldn't save the world,</i>
<i>he said, but he could save me,</i>

369
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,236
<i>preserve my beauty</i>
<i>for all eternity,</i>

370
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,038
<i>but only if I was ready</i>
<i>to leave the screen.</i>

371
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,206
<i>Forever.</i>

372
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:50,975
<i>And so, with a cool touch,</i>

373
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,978
<i>and a warm kiss,</i>
<i>I was truly free.</i>

374
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,881
<i>Immortal.</i>
<i>No longer just a shadow.</i>

375
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:58,382
When I arrived in New York,

376
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,918
the press reported
that I had fallen ill.

377
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:03,721
I let them believe it,
knowing the reports

378
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:07,625
were all I would need to have
Natacha fly to my side.

379
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:11,028
When she came to me,

380
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:14,965
I shared with her the dark gift
Murnau had given to me.

381
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,600
And now we want
to share it with you.

382
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:20,570
Come away with us.

383
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:22,973
There's a train that leaves
tomorrow night to New York.

384
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,242
From there, to Europe. Anywhere.

385
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:26,933
Everywhere.

386
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:39,289
Yes.

387
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:41,524
Yes...

388
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:44,560
and forever.

389
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,133
I missed you.

390
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,571
You hear the one
about the tongue?

391
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,414
Cut out of the victim's head
with a hacksaw,

392
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:17,211
then nailed to the floor
with a hammer.

393
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:19,156
While she was alive.

394
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,424
You're freaking me out.

395
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,726
That monster is here,
right behind that door?

396
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:26,430
What kind of psycho thinks
of that shit?

397
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:28,365
Much less do it.

398
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,602
And they only have
one guard at the door?

399
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:35,473
I'm plenty enough for anything.

400
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:36,840
You better pay
attention to that door,

401
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,675
make sure nothing bad comes out.

402
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,504
Hey, man, you okay?

403
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:15,570
Who are you?

404
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:18,306
I'm Wren.

405
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:27,915
You didn't eat your dinner.

406
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:29,817
I'm not hungry for that.

407
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:32,320
They can get you something else.

408
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:35,590
I don't want to feed anymore.

409
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:43,130
Why did they put
you in here, Wren?

410
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,666
Because I wouldn't talk to them.

411
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,935
The police officer?

412
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:50,503
Detective Hahn.

413
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,049
They found you
at the TV station.

414
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,452
You saw what happened.

415
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,554
I helped.

416
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:11,391
You must have been terrified.

417
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:12,959
The man you saw

418
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:15,962
has done a lot of bad things.

419
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:19,372
Ugly, scary things.

420
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:24,103
But you don't have to be afraid
of him anymore.

421
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:26,606
Do you believe that?

422
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,808
I do.

423
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:31,811
But nobody forced me
to do anything.

424
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:41,220
Oh, sweet Jesus.

425
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:43,355
Don't.

426
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,067
Wren.

427
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:59,470
You killed the security guard.

428
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,606
He was going to catch him.

429
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,219
I want to know
we can trust each other, Wren.

430
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,316
I won't lie to you.

431
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:19,357
Can you promise the same to me?

432
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:23,160
I was there the other times.

433
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:26,230
<i>When he nailed their tongues</i>
<i>to the table.</i>

434
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,966
When he hung the brothers
from the beds.

435
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,203
He cut open their stomachs.

436
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,839
It stunk.

437
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:38,408
Now do you believe me?

438
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,313
You were there.

439
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,753
But whatever he made you do,

440
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:54,458
whatever you think you did...

441
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,292
he's responsible.

442
00:29:58,344 --> 00:30:00,464
It's not your fault.

443
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,734
It is my fault.

444
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,869
Everything that happened.

445
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:07,103
Please,

446
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:10,139
don't say that.

447
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:13,910
You sound exactly
like my daughter Scarlett.

448
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:17,814
She's around your age, but she's
the oldest little girl I know.

449
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,816
I think deep down
she blames herself

450
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,686
for everything
that's wrong with me.

451
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,924
But it's me,

452
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,459
not her.

453
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:33,263
And it's him,

454
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:35,932
not you.

455
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,401
I like you.

456
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:42,759
You're nothing like my father.

457
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,977
When I was young,

458
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,062
my daddy told me he couldn't
wait for me to grow up.

459
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:59,791
He told me I was gonna be
his little lady.

460
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,494
The way he said it,

461
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,763
it made my stomach hurt.

462
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:10,868
It got so I didn't want
to sleep,

463
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:14,171
<i>'cause every time I woke up</i>
<i>I was a day closer.</i>

464
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,504
<i>One day he left me in a car</i>

465
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:19,356
<i>while he went drinking</i>
<i>at the Cortez.</i>

466
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:32,187
<i>It was so crazy hot.</i>

467
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:35,023
I was like a pizza in the oven.

468
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:37,401
<i>But I didn't open the window,</i>
<i>and I didn't say a word,</i>

469
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,759
<i>because I thought</i>

470
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:41,463
<i>maybe there was a way</i>
<i>I didn't have to grow up.</i>

471
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,404
<i>But I found another way.</i>

472
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:53,007
Now I think maybe growing up
wouldn't have been so bad.

473
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,810
It can't be worse than this.

474
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:57,345
Wren, I don't understand.

475
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,514
Are you telling me
it's your father?

476
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:00,682
He's the killer?

477
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:03,552
No. He died a long time ago.

478
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,552
I'm just... I'm so sick
of this whole thing.

479
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:07,021
I don't want it anymore.

480
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,356
Then let it go.

481
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,186
- Tell me who he is.
- I can't.

482
00:32:10,306 --> 00:32:11,358
Why are you protecting someone

483
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:12,978
who doesn't deserve anything
from you?

484
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:13,925
You wouldn't believe me.

485
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:14,765
He's going to keep

486
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,049
killing people unless
you help me stop him.

487
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,463
Get me out of here, and
I'll show you where he lives.

488
00:32:20,546 --> 00:32:23,437
We're not playing
a game here, Wren.

489
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:25,606
Maybe it's time he got caught.

490
00:32:37,804 --> 00:32:39,199
I'm finally beginning

491
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,335
to feel the life return to me.

492
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,165
How do I look?

493
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:49,009
Terrible.

494
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:53,781
You're being dramatic.

495
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:56,660
That was little
better than the rats.

496
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:58,819
We need more.

497
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,120
Oh.

498
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:02,334
A hundred times more.

499
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:05,826
This thirst--

500
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,728
it's unslakable.

501
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:09,797
Oh.

502
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:12,299
Son of a bitch!

503
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,001
How long have we been
trapped in this place?

504
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,356
Aah. Too long.

505
00:33:17,476 --> 00:33:22,842
I am going...
to rip that man's head off.

506
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,413
I imagine that he is long dead.

507
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:29,882
And in truth, you are as much
to blame for our predicament.

508
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:32,519
You and your little mouse.

509
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:33,987
She had no part in this.

510
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:35,527
We didn't need her.

511
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,287
We had money.
We had the world.

512
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,119
Life everlasting.

513
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:42,629
But you craved your pet.

514
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:45,197
Was she worth it?!

515
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,700
Look at us!

516
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,736
"The Great Lover,"

517
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,906
that magnificent face
that women lusted after,

518
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:58,945
killed themselves over, reduced
to a grotesque monstrosity.

519
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:01,308
Our lives stolen!

520
00:34:01,428 --> 00:34:04,283
Everything gone.

521
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:06,986
You are right.

522
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:09,522
Forgive me, amore.

523
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:11,957
I was foolish.

524
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:17,129
I promise, we will reclaim
all that we have lost.

525
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:19,554
- You are dreaming.
- You will see.

526
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:22,501
Our life will be
far more glorious

527
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:25,204
than it ever was before.

528
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,342
Wrong room, asshole!

529
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:33,011
Dude, those book club
ladies were all over me.

530
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:35,013
Did you see that
redhead lick my balls?

531
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:36,447
You're so full of shit.

532
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:39,017
The hell?
There's only one bed.

533
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:40,852
I'm not sharing a room
with one of you cumsicles.

534
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:42,554
- Ah...
- You're sleeping on the floor.

535
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:45,290
Strippers always get
the shittiest rooms, huh?

536
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,994
What curious creatures.

537
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:51,830
Like the Colossus come to life.

538
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:55,533
The gush of their
blood is deafening.

539
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:59,136
Who are we to deny a gift
from the gods?

540
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:09,013
Oh.

541
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,781
Surely the Wellington

542
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:13,050
is getting cold, Mr. March.

543
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:16,621
Hardly a concern, Ms. Evers.

544
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,037
Perhaps your
guest should be mindful

545
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,406
of the time she's expected.

546
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:38,074
I don't believe

547
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:39,389
I care for your tone, Ms. Evers.

548
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:41,790
The lady of the house
deserves more respect.

549
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,984
Yes, Mr. March.

550
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:47,417
You should be elsewhere.

551
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,922
Dearest!

552
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:55,258
Thank you for seeing me tonight,
James.

553
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:57,025
I know it's a week early.

554
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,494
Mm. Nonsense.

555
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,364
I'd be delighted to host our
meal on any night you choose.

556
00:36:01,398 --> 00:36:03,161
We could have it nightly
instead of monthly.

557
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,067
Just say the word.

558
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:06,969
Once a month, James.

559
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:09,204
That's our arrangement.

560
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,307
I'm far too busy
for anything more.

561
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:12,541
Of course.

562
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:14,136
Would you like an Armagnac?

563
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,044
- I'm having one.
- No, thank you.

564
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:35,997
Yes?

565
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:39,634
I wanted to tell you in person.

566
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:42,136
I plan to marry again.

567
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,973
Splendid!

568
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:48,075
Why, I couldn't be more pleased.

569
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,076
Let's have a toast, shall we?

570
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:51,823
Who's the lucky fellow?

571
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,081
I'd like
to send him some steaks.

572
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,950
Will Drake.

573
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:59,186
Ah, yes.

574
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:01,288
That light-in-the-loafers

575
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:02,503
fellow that bought my hotel.

576
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:05,091
Very good, darling.
Very good.

577
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:06,927
Might I suggest
that when you murder him,

578
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,228
you do so off the property?

579
00:37:08,348 --> 00:37:09,475
It'd be damned awkward

580
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,406
to keep running into him
for all eternity.

581
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:14,134
And what makes you think
I mean to do him harm?

582
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:18,071
I'm dead, dear. Not stupid.

583
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:21,176
And how do you know
I haven't found love?

584
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:25,379
True love maybe
for the very first time.

585
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:29,816
Surely not for the first time,

586
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,184
Mrs. March.

587
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:36,556
I've always been scrupulously
honest with you, James.

588
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,554
I never pretended
more than I felt.

589
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:43,332
And I never claimed to love you.

590
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,416
Yes.

591
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:51,471
Oh.

592
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:04,716
But then, I wasn't
referring to myself now,

593
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:07,319
was I?

594
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:10,122
What do you mean?

595
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,064
I thought I could
make you love me.

596
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,400
I thought if I
gave you everything

597
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:24,136
your little heart desired--

598
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,240
riches, comfort...

599
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:32,043
this hotel--

600
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,646
but none of it moved you.

601
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,397
I could never compete
with the shadow of a god

602
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:42,821
on a screen, 20 feet tall!

603
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:46,425
No, let him go!

604
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,259
- Let her go!
- Let him go!

605
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:53,164
I have a sneaking suspicion

606
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,400
you're going to miss your train.

607
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,827
Oh.

608
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,366
Oh.

609
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:34,838
Rudy?

610
00:39:36,497 --> 00:39:38,308
Where are we?

611
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:42,303
Oh, my God.

612
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,490
Yes.

613
00:40:48,776 --> 00:40:51,246
Your god.

614
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:55,883
Trapped within the walls
of the palace I built

615
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:58,553
for my queen.

616
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:03,577
That's what was back there?!

617
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:05,982
Not... anymore.

618
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:30,650
All right.

619
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:33,219
Go.

620
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,734
All right, I got you out.

621
00:41:48,768 --> 00:41:51,237
Now you take me to him.

622
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,638
Wren...

623
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:53,936
Then we need to go home.

624
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,575
Where?

625
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,175
The Cortez.

626
00:41:58,492 --> 00:41:59,937
All right, don't be afraid.

627
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:01,418
When I find him,
I'm gonna bury him

628
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:03,716
in a hole so deep, he'll
never see the light of day.

629
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:06,818
It's time to make him stop.

630
00:42:06,852 --> 00:42:09,354
Will you kill him?

631
00:42:09,388 --> 00:42:11,456
If I have to.

632
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,458
I really like you.

633
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,229
I hate to see it end.

634
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:21,065
Good-bye, John.

635
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,800
Wren!

636
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:25,570
No!

637
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,610
