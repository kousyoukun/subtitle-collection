1
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,917
约翰逊夫人 您是怎么找到我的呢
Mrs. Johnson, may I ask how you found me?

2
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:47,955
我的朋友玛格丽特・吉布森告诉我的
I was given your name through my friend Margaret Gibson.

3
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,258
我们曾一起拍过电影
She and I used to be in pictures together.

4
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,961
她说你帮她解决了
She said you were able to help her

5
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:55,971
一些问题
with her... problem.

6
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,165
玛格丽特 我记得
Margaret, yes.

7
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,167
她是个可爱的女孩
She's a lovely girl.

8
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:04,171
你看 我已经结婚了
I'm married, you see.

9
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:07,174
丈夫并不知道我期望着
My husband doesn't even know that I'm expecting...

10
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:11,178
约翰逊夫人 你不必多加解释
Mrs. Johnson, you don't need to explain anything to me.

11
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:14,414
我是来帮助你的
I'm here to help you.

12
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:17,288
那么 有多久身孕呢
So, how far along are you?

13
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,630
三个星期
Three weeks.

14
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,668
请进
Please.

15
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,353
穿过去就是
Just through there.

16
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,396
医生 这支温度计
Doctor, there must be something wrong

17
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:05,735
肯定有问题
with this thermometer.

18
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:08,166
上面显示体温75度[约等于24摄氏度]
It says her body temperature is 75 degrees.

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,167
这可能吗
Can that be right?

20
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,168
别傻了
Don't be a fool.

21
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:11,469
这不可能
She'd be dead.

22
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,507
好了 亲爱的 我要你吸气
All right, my dear, I want you to breathe in

23
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,543
然后倒数
and count backwards.

24
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:23,048
就这样
There you are.

25
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:24,349
嘘
Shh...

26
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:27,385
很好
Very good.

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,421
嘘
Shh...

28
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,693
好了
There you are.

29
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,695
给我大手术刀
Get me the big knife.

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,407
准备好医用盘
Ready the pan.

31
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:58,482
准备缝合
Closing her up.

32
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,716
护士 丢掉它
Nurse, dispose of that.

33
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,385
我觉得它还活着
I think it's still alive.

34
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:25,607
恭喜你 是个男孩
Congratulations, it's a boy.

36
00:04:58,723 --> 00:04:59,790
嗨 爸爸
Hi, Daddy.

37
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,099
霍尔登
Holden?

38
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:11,201
霍尔登
Holden!

39
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:53,910
噢
Oh.

49
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:49,897
为什么和你做爱这么爽
Why is it so good with you?

50
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,666
因为你是孤儿
Because you're an orphan.

51
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,668
孤儿喜欢我这样的女孩
Orphans love girls like me

52
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:56,204
感觉就像是爸妈都在身边
because it's like Mommy and Daddy are both in the room.

53
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,774
全身心爱着你
Loving you to pieces.

59
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,254
我有东西给你
I got you something.

60
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:18,726
帮助你开始
Just to get you started.

61
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,228
最基础的 勃朗特和王尔德的作品
The basics-- Bronte and Wilde.

62
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:23,998
你会爱上王尔德的
Oh, you're gonna love Wilde.

63
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:26,033
哇
Wow.

64
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,469
谢谢 莉兹
Thanks, Liz.

65
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:32,073
我有好多年没有正经读过书了
I don't think I've read anything in years

66
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,841
大部分时间看的
that didn't have the month and a picture

67
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,910
都是一些关于明星娱乐的杂志
of Jennifer Aniston or Kim K. On the cover.

68
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:40,848
我搬来这之后才开始阅读名著
I never did any real reading till I moved out here.

69
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,851
很大原因是前台工作很空闲
Part of it was all the free time at the desk,

70
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:47,654
但我觉得如果要让自己全身心放下时
but I also think you can't shut down one part of yourself

71
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,924
不能只是一部分
without shutting down the whole thing.

72
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,727
当我将本我暴露出来时
And when I let the Liz out,

73
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,429
我可以看见和感受
I could see and feel

74
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:58,131
体验世界
and... taste.

75
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:00,166
甚至去爱
And love.

76
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,970
你爱我吗
Do you love me?

77
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:13,179
哦
Oh...

78
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:14,681
我不知道
I don't know.

79
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:16,983
我想是吧
I think so,

80
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:21,221
但是 该死的 你这么帅让人怎么办
but, goddamn it, who can tell when you're so damn handsome?

81
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,827
我想我爱你
I think I love you.

82
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,998
-别戏弄我  -我认真的
- Don't tease me. - I'm serious.

83
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,534
当我到大厅见你时
When I come down to the lobby and see you,

84
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:38,572
你看到我 似乎真的很开心
it's like... you're genuinely happy to see me.

85
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,908
我相信你
I believe you.

86
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:48,847
当你出现时
When you come down,

87
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:51,850
对我来说
it's like...

88
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,886
就好像圣诞节清晨那样欣喜
it's like it's Christmas morning for me.

89
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:01,794
我想说 从没有人对我有过这种想法
I mean, no one's ever felt that way about me before.

90
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,796
从来没有
Ever.

91
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,298
甚至人们觉得
No one's even thought I was smart enough

92
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:06,799
我看不懂书
to give real books to.

93
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:10,636
你知道最奇怪的是什么吗
And you want to know the weirdest part?

94
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:13,696
当我们做爱时 我发誓
When we screw, I swear,

95
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:17,109
这是我这辈子最硬的时候
I've never come harder in my life.

96
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:21,546
太奇怪了
It's so bizarre.

97
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,349
我并不是同性恋
Uh, I'm not gay or anything.

98
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:28,954
喜欢我不代表你是同性恋
You're not gay for being with me.

99
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:30,956
我是女孩
I'm a girl.

100
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,058
我喜欢男人
I'm a hetero girl.

101
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:46,238
谢谢你 将我看做女孩
Thank you... for seeing the girl.

102
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,407
喂
Hey.

103
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:53,744
你为什么哭了
Why are you crying?

104
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,815
因为我爱你
Because I do love you.

105
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,184
但我们不会有什么结果的
And I know this doesn't end well.

106
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:01,986
这也不该发生
And it shouldn't.

107
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,923
特别是我对女伯爵做了那些事后
Not after what I've done to The Countess.

108
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,325
她把一切给了我
She gave me everything.

109
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,993
我们这也对她是错误的
It's wrong what we're doing to her.

110
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:09,994
喂
Hey.

111
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,196
爱情怎么会是错误的呢
How can love be wrong?

112
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:15,766
如果她看到我们在一起
If she could just see us together,

113
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,235
她会理解的
she'd understand.

114
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:53,069
你想体验新花样吗
Do you want me to do something different?

115
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:55,305
和女人在一起都会这样
This always to me with women.

116
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,840
我爱她们
I love them.

117
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,876
我爱她们的身体
I love their bodies and...

118
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:02,979
还有她们的柔情
...and their femininity

119
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:06,483
还有性爱
and their sex...

120
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:09,520
但我的上下两部分是分开运转的
but my cock and my mind operate separately.

121
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,890
我很尴尬
I'm very embarrassed.

122
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,691
不尴尬
Hardly embarrassing.

123
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:18,694
这不是危机
This isn't a crisis.

124
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,097
这是一次
It's a...

125
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:24,234
邀你去探险的机会
invitation for an adventure.

126
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,080
抱歉
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,250
我得走了
I got to go.

128
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,553
不要
Don't...

129
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:47,078
不要和她说起我们 还不能说 好吗
don't talk to her about us... just yet, okay?

130
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:52,127
让这段感情 暂时成为我们的秘密
Let it be just ours... for a little while longer.


137
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,645
什么情况
What's this?

138
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,245
我和德雷克先生需要帮助
I need some help with Mr. Drake.

139
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,147
我不是同性恋
I'm not gay.

140
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:13,415
瞎说
Bullshit.

141
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,217
几周前 你在我办公室
A few weeks ago, you were in my office

142
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,718
和我说起你在狱中上过的男人们
telling me about all the dick you took in prison.

143
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,053
老兄 我和你开玩笑呢
I was messing with you, man.

144
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:20,389
监狱的事情都是瞎编的
I made up all that jail stuff.

145
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:23,092
我有自己的理由
I had my reasons.

146
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,162
你只要把他弄硬 宝贝
Just fluff him up for me a bit, baby.

147
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,730
之后的事我来做
I'll finish him off.

148
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:31,099
我不想做
I don't want to.

149
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,333
没兴致
I'm not into it.

152
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,737
你有一小时的时间
You are for the next hour.

156
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:02,595
我需要你帮助
I need your help.

157
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:08,068
在我用西洋棋之夜来欢迎你
Judging by how fast you put your nose up in the air

158
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,337
而你不假思索地拒绝我时
when I offered you an evening of backgammon and ros--

159
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:14,141
我可以很明确地告诉你 我不是你的好闺蜜
to welcome you, no less-- I'm really not your girl.

160
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:16,576
约翰发现了睡棺
John somehow discovered the sleeping chamber.

161
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,179
他现在哪
Where is he now?

162
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,348
我给他用了两毫克咪达唑仑
I gave him two milligrams of Versed

163
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:23,350
现在正处于睡眠状态
to keep him out for a couple of hours.

164
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:26,153
他不能知道我和霍尔登的事
He can't know about Holden and me.

165
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:28,355
失去他时我简直活不下去
I almost died when I lost him.
