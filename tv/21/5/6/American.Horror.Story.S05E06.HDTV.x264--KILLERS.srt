00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,917
CHARLES: Mrs. Johnson,
may I ask how you found me?

2
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:47,955
I was given your name through
my friend Margaret Gibson.

3
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,258
She and I used
to be in pictures together.

4
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,961
She said you
were able to help her

5
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:55,971
with her... problem.

6
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,165
Margaret, yes.

7
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,167
She's a lovely girl.

8
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:04,171
I'm married, you see.

9
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:07,174
My husband doesn't even know
that I'm expecting...

10
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:11,178
Mrs. Johnson, you don't need
to explain anything to me.

11
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:14,414
I'm here to help you.

12
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:17,288
So, how far along are you?

13
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,630
Three weeks.

14
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,668
Please.

15
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,353
Just through there.

16
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,396
(whispering): Doctor,
there must be something wrong

17
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:05,735
with this thermometer.

18
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:08,166
It says her body temperature
is 75 degrees.

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,167
Can that be right?

20
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,168
Don't be a fool.

21
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:11,469
She'd be dead.

22
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,507
All right, my dear,
I want you to breathe in

23
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,543
and count backwards.

24
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:23,048
There you are.

25
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:24,349
Shh...

26
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:27,385
Very good.

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,421
Shh...

28
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,693
There you are.

29
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,695
Get me the big knife.

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,407
Ready the pan.

31
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,479
(splatters)

32
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:58,482
Closing her up.

33
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,716
Nurse, dispose of that.

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,385
I think it's still alive.

Thanks, Liz.

72
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:32,073
I don't think I've
read anything in years

73
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,841
that didn't have the
month and a picture

74
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,910
of Jennifer Aniston or
Kim K. on the cover.

75

(chuckles)

76
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:40,848
I never did any real reading
till I moved out here.

77
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,851
Part of it was all
the free time at the desk,

78
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:47,654
but I also think you can't
shut down one part of yourself

79
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,924
without shutting down
the whole thing.

80
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,727
And when I let the Liz out,

81
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,429
I could see and feel

82
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:58,131
and... taste.

83
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:00,166
And love.

84
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,970
Do you love me?

85
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:13,179
Oh...

86
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:14,681
I don't know.

87
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:16,983
I think so,

88
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:21,221
but, goddamn it, who can tell
when you're so damn handsome?

89
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,827
I think I love you.

90
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,998
- Don't tease me.
- I'm serious.

91
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,534
When I come down to
the lobby and see you,

92
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:38,572
it's like... you're
genuinely happy to see me.

93
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,908
I believe you.

94
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:48,847
When you come down,

95
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:51,850
it's like...

96
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,886
it's like it's
Christmas morning for me.

97
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:01,794
I mean, no one's ever felt
that way about me before.

98
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,796
Ever.

99
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,298
No one's even thought
I was smart enough

100
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:06,799
to give real books to.

101

And you want to know
the weirdest part?

103
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:13,696
When we screw, I swear,

104
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:17,109

come harder in my life.

106

107
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,349
Uh, I'm not gay or anything.

108
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:28,954
You're not gay
for being with me.

109
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:30,956
I'm a girl.

110
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,058
I'm a hetero girl.

111
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:46,238
Thank you...
for seeing the girl.

00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:53,744
Why are you crying?

115
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,815
Because I do love you.

doesn't end well.

And it shouldn't.

Not after what I've
done to The Countess.

123
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:15,766

see us together,

124

your nose up in the air

171
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,337
when I offered you an evening
of backgammon and rosé--

172
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:14,141
to welcome you, no less--
I'm really not your girl.

173
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:16,576
John somehow discovered
the sleeping chamber.

174
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,179
Where is he now?

175
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,348
I gave him two milligrams
of Versed

176
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:23,350
to keep him out for
a couple of hours.

177
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:26,153
He can't know about
Holden and me.

178
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:28,355
I almost died when I lost him.

179
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,158
I get it.

180
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,993
That once-in-
a-lifetime love,

181
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:36,195
it's the only thing
that can gut you raw

182
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:40,232
and make your world
pyrotechnic in color.

183
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,368
Everyone's entitled
to one true love.

184
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:47,574
There's a broom and a dustpan

185
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:49,281
in the cleaning closet,
Nanny McPhee.

186
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:52,378
We got to get rid
of those coffins.

187
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:19,605
Where am I?

188
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,042
I just saw you.

189
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:26,044
In a coffin.

190
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,348
You called me, John.

191
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,517
You said you were
having visions,

192
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:34,019
and you were afraid,
and you asked me to come,

193
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,255
and so I did.

194
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:39,225
I found you lying in the hallway
outside your room.

195
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,529
(groans)

196
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:46,532
No, I was asleep.

197
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:50,068
Holden... came in

198
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:52,527
and woke me up

199
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:56,341
and told me to follow him
down to the basement where...

200
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,010
Where there was
an empty swimming pool?

201
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:02,180
Filled with sleeping
children in glass coffins?

202
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:07,018
You realize this is exactly
what Scarlett told us.

203
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,645
Her exact memories.

204
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:11,115
It makes sense, doesn't it?

205
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:13,532
They become your own... visions.

206
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,360
Alex, I'm telling you
what happened.

207
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:18,029
I think
you're having a psychotic break.

208
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:21,032
I think you've been heading
this way for a while.

209
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,233
You need to get out of here,

210
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:23,801
and you need to get
professional help.

211
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:26,571
No, I'm going down to that room.

212
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:28,072
I'm gonna see it for myself.

213
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:30,407
You can come with me
if you want.

You going soft on me?

You don't give two shits
about those kids.

It's not about them.

238
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:20,247
But you know when I stab
at their little hearts,

239
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,816
I'll be stabbing at hers,

240
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,852
and you're still not over her.

241

You go...
sniff her panties.

00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,737
I'll take care of this myself.

247
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:53,780
Oh...

248
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,448
Well, son of a bitch!

Well, guess you were.

00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:07,527
Damn, woman.

00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,128
What's got into you?

257
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:11,631
About six pints
of O-negative

258
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:14,667
from a couple of
smart alecks in room 36.

259
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:19,706
It's a whole new you.

260
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,140
Damn straight it is.

261
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:25,645
That boy of yours pussed out,
but not you.

262
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,980
You must really hate
the little shits.

263
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,649
Nah, I don't hate 'em.

264
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:31,751
Maybe even love 'em a little.

265
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,686
It's her I hate.

266
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,689
That's why those kids
have got to go first.

267
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:38,758
They're her reason for living.

268
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:39,859
That's cold.

269
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:41,361
No.

270
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,279
It's a kindness.

271
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:45,365
This is no place for children.

272
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:46,733
Come on, let's go find the kids.

273
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,067
No, no, no, no.

274
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:49,535
You find them,

275
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,703
'cause it sounds like
you know what to do.

276
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,938
But even with that done,
she'll still have

277
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,040
one little reason to go on,

278
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,776
and I'm gonna tend to that.

279
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,583

Supercharged?

We are lost in this

287
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:48,992
It's like a maze.

we are dead.

Why do you think you're dead?

you'll both be stuck

over and over again.

How hard is it

306

to get some goddamn kale
around here?!

307
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:36,772
It's the power of the hotel.

308
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,441
Makes you lose your compass.

309
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:40,976
Your sense of yourself.

310

Of anything.

311
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:47,181
But there are those who have
broken out of that cycle.

312
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:53,888
Her name was Cara.

313
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:56,391
She was an elementary
school teacher.

314
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:58,826
<i>She had so much love to give</i>

315
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,262
<i>but nobody to give it to.</i>

316
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:05,266
<i>She came to the Cortez</i>
<i>to end it all.</i>

317
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,576
I love the bouquet
of rotting flesh.

318
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:23,784
DONOVAN: <i>Cara was sitting
in that tub for months.</i>

319
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:25,819
<i>Decomposing.</i>

320
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,897
<i>Never drink the water</i>
<i>from the fifth floor,</i>

321
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:39,899
<i>unless you want a taste of Cara.</i>

322
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:42,402
She was like us?

323
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:43,736
Aimless.

324
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,472
Leaving wet spots on the floor.

325
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:49,176
Until she found her purpose.

326
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,383
(screams)

327
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:03,888
Cara enjoyed terrorizing
the hotel guests.

328
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:05,638
(chuckles)

329
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:09,227
She was quite fond of the pool
until they drained it.

330
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,278
So if we find our purpose,

331
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:12,798
we can leave the hotel?

332
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,933
You don't get to leave.

333
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:18,236
All you get is a reprieve
from the hamster wheel.

334
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,906
Eternity can be tedious

335
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:25,243
without something enjoyable
to break up the day.

336
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,946
What about you?

337
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,089
What's your purpose?

338
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,050
I lost mine when I lost her.

339
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:56,040
Oh, Bartholomew...

340
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,314
Bartholomew...

341
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:06,984
where are you?

342
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:12,089
Aw, come on out, love bug.

343
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:14,458
It's Auntie Ramona.

344
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:26,170
Oh...

345
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:29,507
I've missed you.

346
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,109
Auntie Ramona's here.

347
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,380
(laughs)

348
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:38,082
Aw...

349
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:43,554
Bartholomew...

350
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:50,060
(Ramona gasps)

351
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,497
(quiet snarling)

352
00:24:58,002 --> 00:25:00,503
Bartholomew.

353
00:25:04,943 --> 00:25:06,043
Oh...

354
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,384
I've got a surprise for you.

355
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:17,054
(trilling, hissing)

356
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:19,089
♪

357
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,339
I left the door open to the dishhouse,

358
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,193
so it's possible he may
just crawl back in there.

359
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:42,962
He can't have gotten far.

360
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:45,804
We need to find him before
The Countess gets back,

361
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:48,133
or there'll be hell to pay.

362
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,941
You want some more ice for that?

363
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:56,776
Mmm.

364
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,569
Mmm, naw.

365
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:01,245
It'll be all healed
up in an hour.

366
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:04,783
Did you find it?

367
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:07,118
It's being taken care of.

368
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:09,153
That thing

369
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:11,957
should've died way back
when it was supposed to.

370
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:13,224
Same thing could be said

371
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,226
for a lot of people around here.

372
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,328
Which is why

373
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:19,831
I have to ask you to leave.

374
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:22,601
Not that it's not been
nice having you here.

375
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:25,003
It is, I have missed you.

376
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:28,073
All the other girls around here
are either dead or dumpy.

377
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:29,107
(laughs)

378
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:31,275
But I can't have any upsets.

379
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,670
- Not now.
- Why?

380
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,078
What's going on?

381
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:38,082
Come on, spill the tea.

382
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:39,717
I'm in love.

383
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:43,952
Finally

384
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:46,957
and for the first time
in my life.

385
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:48,959
Well, I'll be damned.

386
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:50,694
I sensed a glow.

387
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:51,962
- Yeah?
- Who is he?

388
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:53,464
Oh!

389
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,199
Not one of them
rough trade corner boys

390
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:57,968
- you always liked too much?
- No.

391
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:00,161
His name is Tristan.

392
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:01,831
He's young.

393
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:03,949
He's beautiful.

394
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:08,045
He's...
exquisitely damaged.

395
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,914
He's mine.

396
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:12,215
Mostly.

397
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,051
Tristan?

398
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:17,220
Isn't that the name of
The Countess' new squeeze?

399
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,455
She doesn't love him.

400
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:19,619
Of course she doesn't.

401
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,258
You think that's gonna matter?

402
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:24,461
Look, if you really
want to be with this boy,

403
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,297
what you need to do is run.

404
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:30,134
Tristan is a passing
fancy for her.

405
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,069
If I am really honest with her,

406
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:34,071
if I tell her from the heart

407
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:36,405
what we mean to each other,
she will understand.

408
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:40,455
Oh, she will rip that heart
right out of your chest.

409
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,405
Just know when it's time to run.

410
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,152
(sobbing)

411
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:11,941
We just wanted to stop walking.

412
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:14,276
What?

413
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:15,287
I can't hear...

414
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,646
Tino, you're breaking up.

415
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:21,149
Come on, man,
it's going to be epic.

416
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:23,919
Okay? I need my wingman.

417
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,221
I got a room.

418
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,122
Will Drake's hotel downtown.

419
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:30,226
Gotta be a ton
of models hanging out.

420
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,994
Hello? Tino?

421
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,230
(phone beeping)

422
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:35,598
Shit.

423
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:44,082
Are you lost?

424
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:45,752
I'm looking for a ride.

425
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:47,322
Maybe you found one.

426
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:49,054
Fast & the Furious.

427
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,812
I can do that.

428
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:56,383
Or it can be... slow

429
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,319
and sweet.

430
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,223
(grunting)

431
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,476
Jesus!

432
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:16,137
Who the hell are you?

433
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,139
That's my friend Vendela.

434
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,742
I want to play.

435
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,010
(giggles)

436
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,180
Oh, I get it.

437
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:30,317
This is some kind of scam.

438
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,153
You two are pros.

439
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,889
I'm getting double-teamed
and then you make me pay.

440
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:36,657
No way, Jose.

441
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,359
Mr. Woo does not
pay for pussy.

442
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:46,066
I'm gonna take a leak.

443
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:48,302
You two better be gone
when I come out.

444
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,981
No more hallways.

445
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:06,486
(crashing, glass breaking)

446
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:09,290
(stabbing, gasping)

447
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:17,263
VENDELA:
Fast & Furious!

448
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:18,632
(screaming)

449
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,372
(laughing)

450
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:34,147
Who are you?

451
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:35,982
A friend.

452
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:38,552
My name's Alex.

453
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,320
Who is he?

454
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:43,289
Just some stupid guy
with a big hard-on.

455
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:44,687
(sniffs)

456
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:47,174
We were trying
to find our purpose.

457
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:51,097
So you're not upset
because he's dead?

458
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:53,632
Killing him was nothing.

459
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:54,934
That's the problem.

460
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:55,775
(sniffs)

461
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,307
I sort of feel sorry for him.

462
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,636
AGNETHA:
Me, too.

463
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,404
We can't go back
to the hallways.

464
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:02,072
You don't have to.

465
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,216
You can find your purpose
without killing them.

466
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,911
What do we do?

467
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:09,647
You can break their minds.

468
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,318
I have the perfect idea.

469
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:18,621
I know this guy.

470
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:21,149
He's always wanted two girls.

471
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,792
(indistinct conversation)

472
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:32,461
Excuse me a second.

473
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:33,404
Lowe.

474
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,625
What are you doing here?

475
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:35,909
It's another one, isn't it?

476
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,402
How was the victim posed?
Who called you about this?

477
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:39,803
I have a police scanner
in my room.

478
00:31:39,838 --> 00:31:40,955
It's a Commandment murder.

479
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:42,372
Nothing's been determined.

480
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,008
We just began to process
the crime scene.

481
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:46,820
Yeah. Don't pull this shit
on me now.

482
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:10,332
HAHN:
All right, come on.

483
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,767
- Come on.
- Yeah.

484
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,536
It all fits.

485
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,937
A televangelist.
He's preaching

486
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:16,252
the gospel of prosperity.

487
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:17,435
He used the word of God

488
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:19,116
to make money.
It's another commandment.

489
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,962
Thou shalt not take
the Lord's name in vain.

490
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:22,468
I can be useful
to this case, Andy.

491
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:24,113
We don't need you, John.

492
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,219
We got somebody in custody.

493
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,592
(line ringing)

494
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:38,826
(beeping)

495
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,862
♪

496
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,802
Plenty of seats down at the bar.

497
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,973
What are you doing up here?

498
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:55,308
Nothing.

499
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:59,946
Looking for some... one.

500
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,482
You okay?

501
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:05,886
I love my kids.

502
00:33:08,312 --> 00:33:10,690
I love my wife.

503
00:33:12,693 --> 00:33:16,566
It's not my fault
I'm so shitty at it, is it?

504
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:23,502
Why don't I help you
to your room?

505
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:26,039
Get to bed.

506
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:29,842
No telling
what kinds of undesirables

507
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:32,511
you're going to run into
out in the halls.

508
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:35,614
Those undesirables
should be worried

509
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,683
about running into me right now.

510
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:39,852
John?

511
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:42,188
Come on.

512
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,789
Come on.

513
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:45,358
- Come on.
- No.

514
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,660
No, don't take this from me!

515
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,662
This is my breakdown--
I'm gonna have it.

516
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,702
(women giggling nearby)

517
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,975
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

518
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,016
Are you looking for Liz?

519
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,050
No.

520
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:13,952
We are looking for you.

Looks like that breakdown
is going well.

538
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,986
Is that your blood?

539
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,691
I don't know.

540
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,961
Where are the girls?

00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:33,515
Look at the right
old mess you've made.

542
00:35:33,524 --> 00:35:35,898
This much blood
will take three washings.

543
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,568
The sheets will lose
their thick pile.

544
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:41,335
Mr. Man, thank you.

545
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:43,773
You're much better
than a Universal Studio tour.

546
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:46,242
Fast and furious.

547
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,977

550
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,749
We have a purpose.

551
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,917
Get out!

552
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,452
Get out of my room!

553
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:58,187
Harlots.

554
00:35:58,221 --> 00:35:59,788
Those Nordic types,

555
00:35:59,822 --> 00:36:02,124
they have no respect
for fresh linens.

556
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:03,158
It's not in their culture.

557
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:04,460
It's a well-known fact.

558
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:05,527
You, too.

559
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:07,192
Get out of my room.

560
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,634
I haven't collected
the pillow cases yet...

561
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:15,537
Get out of my room!

562
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:18,073
MARCH:
John!

563
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:24,011
Good to see you're

564
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,046
finally, truly

565
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:29,049
checking in to the Hotel Cortez.

566
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:32,186
(screaming)

567
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:36,957

568
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:04,518
(water running)

00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,401
(elevator bell dings)

570
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,016
You haven't said a word to me

571
00:37:57,036 --> 00:37:58,571
since I picked you up
at Dinah's.

572
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:01,006
Where's your mom?

573
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,041
How should I know?

574
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,346
Do you know how
embarrassing it is

575
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,248
when your friend asks
what time you're going home

576
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:11,417
and your mom doesn't
even answer the phone?

577
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:15,398
I'm sorry, honey.

578
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:17,815
I'm sure there was
some kind of emergency.

579
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:20,097
She hasn't called
me for two days.

580
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,237
Are you leaving now?

581
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:23,147
What?

582
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:24,910
You don't live here anymore.

583
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:25,844
No, I'm staying here

584
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,880
until we sort this out, okay?

585
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,846
I'll never leave you alone.

586
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:45,930
(Scarlett crying)

587
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:02,914
I know things seem crazy,
but you have to believe me,

588
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:05,417
I-I'm gonna make
things right again.

589
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:06,918
You can't.

590
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:09,125
Not by yourself.

591
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:13,023
I will talk to Mom.

592
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,127
Is that blood?

593
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:29,239
Dad...

594
00:39:29,273 --> 00:39:31,475
you're scaring me.

595
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:34,678
No, this is nothing, uh, um...

596
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:37,147
It's an accident at the,
uh, at the hotel.

597
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:39,383
I'm gonna go put it
in the laundry, okay?

598
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,080

Scarlett, are you all right?

602
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:51,820
You stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

Ooh, look at that.

605
00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:12,941
Is there anything more beautiful
than a sleeping child?

606
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:15,143
You last night.

607
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:21,483
I love you.

608
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:23,217
I'm gonna put him in bed.

609
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:25,320
I fear I may pass out as well.

610
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:27,121
One too many Klonopin
on the flight.

611
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:28,256
Yes, sleep, my love.

612
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,792
Rest those two beautiful heads.

613
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,899
Sounds like the trip went well.

614
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:39,167
I enjoy him.

615
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:43,271
You seem anxious.

616
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:44,889
I can hear your heartbeat.

617
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:48,343
Yes.

618
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:49,985
There is...

619
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:54,380
something I'd like to
speak with you about.

620
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,617
Do you want to have the surgery?

621
00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:59,820
Because I'm happy to pay
once Will and I finalize things.

622
00:41:59,855 --> 00:42:01,789
No, no.
No, not that.

623
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:03,491
Never that, I think.

624
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:06,327
Um, you see, this is...

625
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,028
hmm...

626
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:11,532
difficult for me and I know
that it may not mean something

627
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:14,334
to someone like you who
does this all the time,

628
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:15,870
but it seems,

629
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:18,606
for the first time,
I've fallen in love.

630
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,375
Well, why would that wonderful
news make you worry?

631
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:30,518
It's Tristan.

632
00:42:34,328 --> 00:42:35,823
Interesting.

633
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:39,159
How long?

634
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:40,793
Not long.

635
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:42,295
A couple of weeks.

636
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,398
I know he's your current

637
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:47,334
mild obsession,

638
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:49,669
but I don't think you love him.

639
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:51,171
Not like I do.

640
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:53,840
You know me.

641
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:56,176
You made me.

642
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,368
I belong to you.

643
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:04,251
But this is my one chance at it.

644
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:07,320
I don't share.

645
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,057
Maybe when I'm done with him.

646
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:14,361
But time passes for me.

647
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:15,862
You measure decades
by the changes in hemlines.

648
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,414
It means nothing to you.

649
00:43:17,651 --> 00:43:19,695
You know as well as anyone

650
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:21,034
that we all just get

651
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:24,571
one great one in our lives.

652
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:31,410
Let's talk to the boy.

653
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:34,313
Thank you.

654
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:38,417
Thanks for calling me first,
Andy, I appreciate it.

655
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:40,219
He's in bad shape, Alex.

656
00:43:41,312 --> 00:43:43,255
He's talking about monsters.

657
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,029
Claims that's
what he's firing at.

658
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,560
So, what do you think?

659
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:51,311
You want to try
to speak to her again?

660
00:43:51,431 --> 00:43:54,233
No.

661
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,902
No, I think it's best if you
get her to her grandma's.

662
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:58,269
No problem.

663
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:02,074
Take care of him.

664
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:03,909
I will.

665
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:06,111
(car door opens, closes)

666
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:08,113
(engine starts)

667
00:44:28,256 --> 00:44:30,902
She's afraid of me.

668
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:34,405
My own daughter.

669
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,641
Maybe I am going crazy.

670
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:41,646
I thought maybe if we got
out of that place...

671
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,315
You are out of that place.

672
00:44:45,284 --> 00:44:46,484
That's all that matters.

673
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,153
You just need some sleep.

674
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:49,287
In your own house.

675
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:51,156
In your own bed.

676
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,191
It's your bed, too.

677
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:02,567
You're going back there,
aren't you?

678
00:45:03,056 --> 00:45:05,270
I don't know
what you're talking about.

679
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:09,374
Still playing that game?

680
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:13,844
Okay.

681
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:18,582
(door slams)

682
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:21,185
(snarling nearby)

683
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:46,343
♪

684
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,848
(snarling)

685
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,361
How was your trip?

686
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:08,365
Welcome home.

687
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:11,397
Sit, love.

688
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:12,402
Who needs a drink?

689
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:14,571
I'll get them.

690
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,130
No, let me.

691
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,463
You two sit.

692
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,447
When you are what I am,

693
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,250
you don't feel things
the way normal humans do.

694
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:30,436
An emotion is like
a flavor in my mouth.

695
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:31,920
I can taste it.

696
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:35,358
Joy tastes like strawberries.

697
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:39,729
Hate is like ice chips
in a martini.

698
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,972
And love is...

699
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,034
rosewater.

700
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,905
I enjoy them all except for one.

701
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,244
Betrayal.

702
00:46:55,278 --> 00:46:59,214
That has the taste of the char
on a piece of burnt meat.

703
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:00,649
You told her.

704
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:02,484
Yes.

705
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,348
The one in the dress

706
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:07,762
has more balls than you... babe.

707
00:47:07,882 --> 00:47:10,005
What do you expect?

708
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:12,179
I'm just gonna spend my life

709
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:14,529
crying over your broken promise?

710
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:17,432
I know I'm dumb

711
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:19,333
and I'm just a model,

712
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:20,935
but I know you.

713
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:23,972
It's not that you
get bored and move on.

714
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,608
Moving on is the point
of the whole thing.

715
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:30,444
That is your orgasm.

716
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:32,246
You collect us

717
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:34,266
and create us
and get us addicted

718
00:47:34,386 --> 00:47:35,873
to the light of your love

719
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:38,419
just so you can take it away.

720
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:40,922
You feed off the heartbreak.

721
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:44,358
Knowing we're out there,
suffering over you.

722
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:46,527
Well, not me!

723
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:49,112
I was made for more than that.

724
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:52,599
For a real love.

725
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:54,267
LIZ:
Please.

726
00:47:54,302 --> 00:47:55,936
After all I've done,

727
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,505
let me just have this one.

728
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:05,078
Is this what you want as well?

729
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:19,760
Fine.

730
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:22,596
You may have him.

731
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,858
He's yours.

732
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:53,893
Bury him.

733
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:59,432
(elevator bell dings)

734
00:49:28,761 --> 00:49:31,262
Alex?

735
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,567
He was hurt.

736
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:38,403
He got out?

737
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:41,808
Yes, but I found him.

738
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:44,108
He lost a little blood,

739
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:46,645
but he's gonna be just fine.

740
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:01,626
You saved my son.

741
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,528
You saved mine.

742
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:35,159
(shushing)
