are there unless you need them.

how he texted you from my phone.

Maybe I should get a gun.

No. No, you-you don't need
to get a gun, all right?

There are ways to clone

Don't worry.

What, by moving out?

00:45:21,867 --> 00:45:23,430
I have a feeling he's
gonna come after me again,

and if that happens, I don't
want either of you near me.

Look, I'm not upset

I secretly want you to go.

I-I understand. You...

I shouldn't have brought
Scarlett to that house.

I-I told that idiot

I'm not mad about that.

put her in danger.

at the one person in the world
