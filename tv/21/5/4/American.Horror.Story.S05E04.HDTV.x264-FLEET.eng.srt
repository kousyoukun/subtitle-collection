2
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,723
How may I he...?

3
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,559
Devil's night.

4
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,628
I have a standing reservation.

5
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:33,263
Of course, Mr. Ramirez.

6
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:36,132
Well, my pleasure to welcome you
to the Hotel Cortez.

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,901
Uh, this is your
second year joining us?

8
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:38,902
Third.

9
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,665
I died in 2013.

10
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:42,172
(laughs):
Apologies.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,240
Let me show you to your room.

12
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:46,309
RAMIREZ: I was hoping Manson
could join us this year.

13
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:49,468
LIZ: Charlie hasn't shuffled
off this mortal coil yet.

14
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:52,367
He's still serving
life in State prison.

15
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,001
Aw, that's too bad.

16
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,503
Your room, sir.

17
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:58,706
The master has left
a couple of treats

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,841
on the pillow.

19
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,076
I don't need a key.

20
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,265
♪

21
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:47,421

00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,957
(screams)
(shushes)

23
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,126
Shut up!

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
Swear to Satan you won't scream

25
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,996
or I'll kill you.

26
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,231
(muffled grunts)

27
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,999
I said swear to Satan!

28
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:03,169
I swear to Satan.

00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:04,938
(screaming)

00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:06,873
You liar!

00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,177
No! (coughing)

32
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:13,079
(mumbling)

33
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:15,749
(crackling)

34
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,515
Help! Help me!

35
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:23,089
There's a killer after me!

36
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:24,827
And a killer before you.

37
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:28,128
Ricky!

38
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,995
Found your presents.

39
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:31,764
Tourists from Arizona.

40
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,732
Marriot was full.

41
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,802
Come, finish her off.
(whimpers)

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,433
Hello?

44
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,702
Hey, Dad.

45
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,103
Hey, sweetie.

46
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,472
Hey.

47
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,510
How was Disneyland?

48
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,512
It's pretty cool.

49
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,514
I was just on my way out.

50
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,316
Uh, I'll be over at Grandma's
in about an hour.

51
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,486
We've got some
Halloween shopping to do.

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,687
I don't really feel like

53
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,523
going trick-or-treating
this year.

54
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,525
Oh, um, okay.

55
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,527
We can do something else.

56
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,694
Actually,

57
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,769
Grandma was gonna teach me

58
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,531
how to make banana cream pie.

59
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,761
Kind of takes a while.

60
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,643
Oh, you want to stay
over there for a lit...

61
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:29,814
a little while longer?

62
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,669
If that's okay.

63
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,605
Look, things are a little bit...

64
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,039
(bubbling nearby)

65
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:38,510
...weird right now, aren't they?

66
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:41,603
A little bit.

67
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,671
I got to go.

68
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:44,795
Bye, Dad.

69
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:46,178
Bye, Scar.

70
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:47,649
I love you.

71
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:04,358
(blood dripping rapidly)

72
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:18,204
(gasps)

73
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:28,076
BOY:
<i>I don't like my costume.</i>

74
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:40,054
Come along, Albert.

75
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:46,861
Here, put this on.

76
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:48,596
I don't like my costume.

77
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,599
Nothing's good enough
for you, Mr. Bellyache.

78
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:55,536
There are places
in the country where they

79
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,604
put paper bags over
the children's head

80
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,305
and call that a costume.

81
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,340
Shake a leg.

82
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,610
I like to be punctual.

83
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,478
(laughing):
Well...

84
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:06,380
look at you, Molly Wilkins!

85
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:09,517
You must've been
sewing for months!

86
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,686
Pulled out all the stops, didn't
you, with that expensive lace?

87
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:16,656
Oh, goodness, I wish I'd had
time to sew a proper pattern...

88
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,991
Boo!

89
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,592
You're a scary little ghost.

90
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:20,660
MS. EVERS:
...do things with your time,

91
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,195
while I'm taking in the laundry

92
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,563
and mending clothes.

93
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:24,864
But I'm so envious.

94
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,599
You look so lovely.

95
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:28,402
I do feel bad for little Albert.

96
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:30,404
He wanted
an African cheetah costume,

97
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:34,441
but I just never found the time.

98
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:38,077
Where is he, the little rascal?

99
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,446
(car engine starts up)

100
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:44,388
No! Please stop!

101
00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:49,422
(knocking)

102
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:50,723
Who is it?

103
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:52,744
It's John Lowe from downstairs.

104
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,093
Oh!

105
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,198
I'm busy!

106
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,535
I'm working on these sheets!

107
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,444
What happened here?
Was there an accident?

108
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:13,745
It happens every year.

109
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,747
At this time.

110
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,583
I-I lost my boy on Halloween.

111
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:21,620
So every year I go a little mad
and I make a mess of everything.

112
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:24,456
And I can't get a-a handle
on the sheet situation.

113
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,491
You lost your boy?

114
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:27,993
You mean he died?

115
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,995
Not right away.

116
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,229
How did you lose him?

117
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:33,497
I didn't see!

118
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:35,600
I wasn't paying attention!

119
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,503
(crying):
It was my fault!

120
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:41,472
I should've made him
a proper costume,

121
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:43,641
like all the children.

122
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,509
I know how that feels,

123
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:48,646
especially
around the anniversary.

124
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,515
I-I made him wear
a plain old sheet.

125
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,684
Just a plain old sheet.

126
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,454
Why didn't I pay
more attention?!

127
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:58,623
I'm not really sure.

128
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:01,033
I feel like I'm living
in a walking nightmare.

129
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,466
Would you like a sherry?

130
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:14,605
I'm okay, thank you.

131
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,940
I'll let you get back...

132
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:19,109
Will-will you pour me one?

133
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:22,679
Talking with you

134
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:25,115
is a comfort to my soul.

135
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:42,532
They searched the city for days.

136
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,293
But he wasn't in the city.

137
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:48,671
<i>His killer...</i>
<i>took him to his ranch</i>

138
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:50,739
<i>up in Wineville.</i>

139
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:52,175
(chickens clucking)

140
00:08:57,648 --> 00:09:00,483
<i>Oh, God, help me!</i>

141
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:04,283
<i>He haunts my dreams.</i>

142
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:09,124
<i>His woeful eyes pierce me</i>
<i>with accusations.</i>

143
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,594
Why weren't you careful Mommy?

144
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:16,498
Didn't you love me, Mommy?

145
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:19,383
(crying)

146
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:22,023
Of course I loved him!

147
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,944
At least you know
what happened to your boy.

148
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,382
But I don't.

149
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,584
Not really.

150
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,874
This is all we found
of your boy, ma'am.

151
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:56,203
That sicko disposed

152
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,810
of all their bodies
in quicklime.

153
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,608
And then he scattered
their bones in a mass grave.

154
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,712
Oh...

155
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,480
(screams)

156
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,684
They never were sure exactly

157
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,653
how many children there were.

158
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:17,857
That is a terrible story, Ms...

159
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,859
Evers.

160
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:22,428
Hazel Evers.

161
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,864
You can call me Hazel.

162
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,198
I'm John.

163
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,190
I know.

164
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:32,672
I have a confession
to make, John.

165
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:36,342
I've known for a while
that we were kindred spirits.

166
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:38,878
(laughing)

167
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:41,147
Oh, my!

168
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:42,915
Oh, my, it's so late
and I'm so behind!

169
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,251
There's so much to do
before the shindig tonight,

170
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:46,385
and so little time!

171
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,887
The master will be

172
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,890
very very upset if his
table isn't perfect.

173
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,492
His autumnal banquet
is the event of the year.

174
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:56,262
These particular guests,
they're very demanding.

175
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:58,831
Refills, refills, refills!

176
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,666
My feet are swollen up
like puff pastries

177
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,168
by the end of the night!

178
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:23,754
(barking)

179
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:28,193
Jasper, stop that.

180
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:29,393
Come here, come here.

181
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:30,862
Jasper, come on.

182
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:33,331
In here.

183
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:36,767
(Jasper growls)

184
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:39,871
He's a sweet dog.

185
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:40,898
He just doesn't
know who you are.

186
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:42,941
We got him two years ago.

187
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,742
Your sister was lonely.

188
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:50,948
I'm gonna do an exam.

189
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:52,816
It'll only take a minute, okay?

190
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:56,486
It's too bright.

191
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,855
Sorry.

192
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:01,291
I'm sorry.
Come over here, baby.

193
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,491
Can you sit still for me?

194
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:12,602
(thermometer beeps)

195
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:17,194
Do you feel cold?

196
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,275
No.

197
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,745
No?

198
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,780
Do you know where you are, baby?

199
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,485
Hmm? Do you remember
this house?

200
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,393
You're home.

201
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,025
You're finally home, baby.

202
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:39,629
Oh, I've missed you so much.

203
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:43,963
I'm thirsty.

204
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:47,345
Of course you are.

205
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,277
I'll get you some juice,
all right?

206
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,869
Be right back.

207
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,994
(sobs quietly)

208
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:17,032
(sobbing)

209
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:36,084
(sniffs)

210
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:49,063
Holden, I've brought you
an apple juice

211
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:50,397
and an orange juice.

212
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:51,898
Wasn't sure which one...

213
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,368
Holden?

214
00:13:57,305 --> 00:14:00,140
- Holden!
- (Jasper whimpers)

215
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:02,176
What is wrong with you?

216
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,910
I don't feel good.

217
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:06,180
I need my mommy.

218
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:07,982
Baby, I am your mommy.

219
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,983
My other mommy.

220
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,958
It's confirmed.

221
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:20,326
Blood on your junkie wasn't his.

222
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,295
So we're looking for a body now.

223
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,931
You don't think
we have enough bodies?

224
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:28,334
Hey, how come
I've never heard of a town

225
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,870
where 20 kiddie murders

226
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,404
and abductions
supposedly took place?

227
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,072
Are you talking about the
Wineville Chicken Coop Murders?

228
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,908
They changed the name
of the town.

229
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,526
Bad publicity.

230
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:39,046
When?

231
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,146
Hell, 60 years ago?

232
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,052
Eighty-five.

233
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:51,356
85... years...

234
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,926
The crimes took place
in the '20s?

235
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,694
Does this have something to do
with our Bible-thumper?

236
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,829
I don't know.

237
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,898
HAHN:
John?

238
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,000
John, you okay?

COUNTESS: You must have
a lot of questions.

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,804
I have answers.

242
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,820
It must have been a shock for you

243
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,662
to see your boy.

244
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,836
I imagined you'd
lost hope long ago.

245
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,525
I never gave up.

246

No, you didn't.

Your devotion moved me.

I could feel your longing.

249
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:23,499
Holden felt it, too.

250
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,502
That's why he came to you.

251
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,788
You stole my son.

252

I saved him.

253
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:32,811

From what?

255
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,709
Neglect.

256
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,553
I could see
where they were headed.

257
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,221
A tragic, wasted life.

258
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:44,889
I opened my heart

259
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,090
and the children
came to me willingly.

260
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,826
I never neglected my son.

261

Can you say the same
about your husband?

262

The world can be
such a dangerous place.

I've had enough
of your bullshit.

273

What did you do to my son?

274
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:39,442
You're a doctor.

275
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,043
I'm going to put it to you

276
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:44,013
in a way that
you can understand.

277
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,082
Holden has contracted
an ancient virus.

278
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:47,884
A blood disorder.

279
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:50,219
The effect of the disease
is health,

280

vitality and everlasting life.

281

...change him back.
Is this why you came up here?

283
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,900
Change him back
or I'll kill you.

284
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,439
There is no going back.

285

No.

286
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,172
I'm his mother.

287
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:12,108
We'll find a cure.

288
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,148
There is no cure.

289
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:15,945
The only way you can truly be
with Holden is to join him.

290

for a chance at that.

And what are you asking me
to trade for it?

294
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,124
What's the price I have to pay
to be like you?

Your undying loyalty.

She won't.

340
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,879
and a special guest

341
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:47,182
of the hotel.

342
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:52,587
Cop.

343
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:54,755
A cop.

344
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:56,357
(laughs)

345
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:57,958
Man! Man.

346
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,194
(bottle clunks on bar)

347
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:02,363
Man, are you lucky
that I haven't had a beer

348
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:05,199
in over a year,
or there is no way in hell

349
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:06,967
I would let you buy me one.

350
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:08,202
They call me a serial killer?

351
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:12,206
Greatest serial killer
of all time is the cops.

352
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:16,477
I know who you are.

353
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:20,181
That is an outstanding costume.

354
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,415
Holy shit, you look
just like her.

355
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,076
Her who?
Aileen Wuornos.

356
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:26,219
Just saw a documentary
about her.

357
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:27,655
She killed seven men.

358
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:30,423
Shot them in cold blood.

359
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,859
(cap pops off bottle)

360
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:34,494
(sighs)

361
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:36,296
Sometimes even I
think that's true.

362
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:42,369
I wasn't more than four or five

363
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,237
when the world
started taking from me.

364
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,409
You know what you do

365
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:52,880
when all you know
is people taking?

366
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,247
You start to give, give it away

367
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:56,683
before they can
take it from you.

368
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:59,018
Give it all away for free,

369
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,387
and that way,

370
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,422
you can pretend
that it doesn't hurt.

371
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,562
Those seven men?
We had a deal.

372
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,263
We had a deal.

373
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:13,156
Then they got greedy,
started taking things

374
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:14,701
didn't belong to 'em.

375
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:16,836
Here's how it is, Detective:

376
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,238
you try and take anything

377
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,307
from Aileen Wuornos

378
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:24,476
and I swear
to Jesus H. Christ

379
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:27,458
I will take everything from you.

380
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:30,917
This is what
I say to you, Aileen:

381
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,487
That's bullshit.

382
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:36,488
Yeah?

383
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:37,723
Yeah.

384
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:40,240
Most of those men
didn't have a history

385
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,394
or record of violence
or assault.

386
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:43,429
I don't know,
I don't know their,

387
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,496
I don't know their history.

388
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:46,565
I only know

389
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,268
who they were on that day.

390
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,502
I only knew them
on that one day,

391
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,996
and on that one day,
they were who they were.

392
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,110
Haven't you ever had
a day like that, huh?

393
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,448
Yeah.

394
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:06,117
Where-where all you were,
all you ever had been

395
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:08,453
your whole life don't mean
nothing to you anymore?

396
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,490
And all of a sudden...

397
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:15,326
you're just
a different person, huh?

398
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:16,461
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

399
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:18,496
Today.

400
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,498
When was the last time
you got laid, huh?

401
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,301
When was the last time
a chick really...

402
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:25,303
really turned you inside out?

403
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:28,673
You don't know screwing
until you spend an hour alone

404
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:30,141
with a batshit crazy hooker.

405
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:32,176
I got a room.

406
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:35,212
Where I can roll.

407
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,352
Darling John,

408
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:45,722
you're too drunk to see
how ugly that woman is.

409
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,760
I'm too drunk to care.

410
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:51,795
(laughs)

411
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:56,466
(chuckles)

412
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,137
You asshole.

413
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:03,540
Goddamn cops.

414
00:25:03,574 --> 00:25:05,508
You can't trust any of them.

415
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,943
Stop taking from me!

416
00:25:06,977 --> 00:25:08,144
I'm tied to a chair!

417
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:09,946
Well, I ain't no liar.

418
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,415
Ten women this shit
country put to death,

419
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:14,350
Ten.

420
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:16,820
And I was number ten.

421
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,822
Stop it! You're insane!

422
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:20,556
You're not Aileen Wuornos!

423
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,557
Yeah?

424
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,861
Look at me.

425
00:25:27,397 --> 00:25:29,365
Look at my eyes.

426
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,534
Look at 'em.

427
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,604
This look like a Halloween
costume to you?

428
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,406
(snickers)

429
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:41,109
Welcome to Devil's Night
at the Hotel Cortez, John.

430
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:07,002
Ain't you...

431
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:09,504
(groans)

432
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:10,804
Yeah, you like that?

433
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:13,508
(screams)

434
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:15,643
Die, you pussy boy!

435
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,850
Asshole!

436
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:24,419
Get... get back here!

437
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:26,554
Bite your damn dick off!

438
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,025
Bring it on, baby!

439
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:30,591
Let's see who you really are.

440
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,059
(spits)

441
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:40,268
(elevator dings)

442
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:52,880
Can I help you?

443
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:57,190
Excuse me.

444
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:58,944
Is there a problem?
Yeah, there's a problem.

445
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:00,360
That skank up in my room
tried to kill me.

446
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:03,196
Skank? You'll have
to be more specific.

447
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,930
You know, that nut job

448
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:07,040
up at the bar pretending
to be Aileen Wuornos.

449
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,794
She's leaving here in cuffs.

450
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,062
Yeah, I wouldn't
bother with that call

451
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,831
you're trying to make.

452
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,833
Even if you got through,
dollars to doughnuts,

453
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,835
you won't find
anyone in your room.

454
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,871
Mr. March is very protective
of his invited guests.

455
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,372
Mr. March?

456
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,494
James Patrick March?

457
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:23,753
The very same.

458
00:27:23,873 --> 00:27:27,645
His annual Devil's Night soiree
is <i>the</i> event of the season.

459
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,516
What the hell is Devil's Night?

460
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,884
Oh, sweetie.

461
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,623
Devil's Night is the real
holiday around here.

462
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,326
Halloween, that's plastic
pumpkins and paper costumes,

463
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,194
but Devil's Night...

464
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,897
is when the real ghouls
come out to play.

465
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,833
A night of mischievous
criminal behavior,

466
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,835
which is why
every year at this time,

467
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,938
Mr. March holds
his annual dinner event.

468
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,872
The guest list
is <i>tres exclusive.</i>

469
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,110
(gasps)

470
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:03,112
Well, that's unusual.

471
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:05,148
Now, how did I miss this?

472
00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:15,024
Lucky you.

473
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:18,895
You've been invited.

474
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,902

475
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:52,929

MAN: The key to a really
good subfloor

478
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:34,438
is containing the moisture
below the floor.

479
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:38,107
See, you need to make sure
that there's a-a... a layer.

480
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:40,744
Like...

481
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:45,247
Hey, John.

482
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,916
Hey, listen,
I-I want to apologize

483
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,417
for what happened, man.

484
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,554
I wasn't mad at you,
it's just...

485
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:52,988
it's just cops in general.

486
00:29:53,022 --> 00:29:55,825
Men in general,
right? (laughs)

487
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:00,395
Hey, hey, come sit next to me.

488
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,064
Between you and me,
you don't want to sit

489
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:03,298
next to Jeff or John.

490
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,434
They like 'em young and
cute, like you. (laughs)

491
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,503
- Just keep your distance.
- Aw...

492
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:09,237
Enjoy your last night
of freedom.

493
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:11,106
You're leaving here
in my custody.

494
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,975
AILEEN:
Hey, come on.

495
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:14,976
I'm sorry about
what happened, man.

496
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,978
- Just sit... you sit here.
- No, Aileen.

497
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:18,746
- John will sit where his name card is.
- (groans)

498
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:20,448
You know we like to do
things formally around here.

499
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:22,149
Hey, suck my left tit,
Clark Gable.

500
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:24,819
Ah, we're all here now.

501
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:28,022
Let's sit-- only so many
hours in the night.

502
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,056
John, you're by the other John.

503
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:30,057
John, you're here.

504
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:31,158
Ricky, here.

505
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:32,994
Ah...

506
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,028
Absinthe.

507
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:36,355
Our customary libation.

508
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:39,066
To our special night
and our new guest.

509
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:46,940
(coughs, laughs)

510
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:51,045
(Aileen whoops)

511
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:54,448
What is this?

512
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,503
Who are you?

513
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:59,853
I'm March, I built this hotel.

514
00:30:59,888 --> 00:31:03,590
The man who built this hotel
died more than 85 years ago.

515
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:08,029
This is my problem
with police officers.

516
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:10,031
All you care about is evidence.

517
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:12,033
Evidence, evidence, evidence.

518
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:13,834
Until that evidence
no longer fits

519
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,569
the narrative
you need to be true,

520
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:19,006
at which point the evidence
becomes an illusion, a mistake.

521
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,240
A trick.

522
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:23,877
You've lived in my hotel
long enough, John,

523
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:26,880
seen enough evidence to know
that what is impossible

524
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:29,882
becomes very possible here.

525
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:33,905
You're late!

526
00:31:35,156 --> 00:31:37,223
RAMIREZ: Too busy
writing letters.

527
00:31:37,258 --> 00:31:38,559
(Aileen laughs)

528
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:40,226
RAMIREZ: I don't
get you, man.

529
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:41,361
The real fun starts
after you get caught.

530
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:42,696
Don't you know that?

531
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,210
And giving yourself
your own nickname?

532
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:45,895
Not cool, dude.

533
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:47,833
It's not cool.

534
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:50,369
Now, let's all
introduce ourselves.

535
00:31:50,403 --> 00:31:52,038
I'm John too, John Gacy.

536
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:54,040
I'm from Norwood Park, Illinois.

537
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:55,808
I own PDM Contractors.

538
00:31:55,842 --> 00:31:58,892
Uh, PDM stands for Painting,
Decorating, Maintenance.

539
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:01,146
And I'm also a member
of the Moose Club.

540
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,037
I mean, just because you got

541
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:03,720
30 bodies buried
in your crawl space

542
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:06,190
don't mean you can't have
a really terrific rec room

543
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,715
and be a respectable
business man.

544
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,618
Uh, my turn?

545
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:17,988
Okay.

546
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:22,192
I'm, uh, Jeffrey Dahmer.

547
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:23,861
From Milwaukee.

548
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:26,629
AILEEN: Oh, John,
I think he likes you.

549
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,332
(laughing): And that
is bad news for you.

550
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:29,867
That's how he picks 'em.

551
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:30,901
He finds the hottest guy
in the room

552
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,336
and the next thing...
(clicks tongue)

553
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,671
(Aileen laughs)

554
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:35,672
AILEEN:
No.

555
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:38,175
All right.

556
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:39,877
Zodiac, they never caught you

557
00:32:39,911 --> 00:32:41,879
but I assume you'd
be dead by now.

558
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:44,014
Dickheads like you don't just
retire from being assholes.

559
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:48,227
Gacy, you were killed by lethal
injection over 25 years ago.

560
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:49,986
Dahmer, you were
murdered in prison.

561
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,888
Deservedly.

562
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:55,131
Aileen Wuornos, put to
death in 2002 in Florida.

563
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:57,960
And I know you, 'cause
you're from my hometown.

564
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,108
Richard Ramirez,
the Night Stalker.

565
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:04,478
You just died of cancer in
your cell a few years back.

566
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,314
What is this?

567
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:08,349
Some kind of Halloween trick?

568
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:10,451
What, are you actors?

569
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:11,819
I invited you here tonight

570
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,821
to help you, John.

571
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:17,825
I've watched you,
and it makes me sad.

572
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:20,828
Because greatness
is about vision.

573
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:23,464
And you have made yourself blind

574
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:26,199
to everything but what
your eyes can see.

575
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:28,201
You need to listen
to this dude, John.

576
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:31,204
He... is the master.

577
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:32,406
I mean, he taught us all.

578
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,409
He's a genius, like Galileo
or Peter Frampton.

579
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:38,412
GACY: That's why we come
here every Devil's Night.

580
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:40,514
It's, uh, like a tradition.

581
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:42,483
It's a real honor to be invited.

582
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:45,519
Only the ones of us who really
took the master's advice

583
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:47,120
gets an invite.

584
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:48,822
Do you know why it took so long

585
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:50,391
for the little piggies
to catch me?

586
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,392
Because one night
I stumbled into this place,

587
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:53,793
and I spent a few nights,

588
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:55,495
and the master,
he came into my room,

589
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:59,465
and he beat the crap
out of me, eh?

590
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,835
And he told me that if I wanted
to be a volume operation

591
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,405
that I needed to be
indiscriminate-- kill anyone.

592
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:08,408
Your pattern needs
to be no pattern.

593
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:09,542
Guess I was out sick
that day. (laughs)

594
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:12,578
It's not funny, Gacy!

595
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,980
We are the Mount Rushmore
of murder.

596
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:17,349
We have reputations,
codes of conduct.

597
00:34:17,384 --> 00:34:18,418
I've told you how many times?

598
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:20,252
Leave no evidence.

599
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:22,021
GACY: I covered
'em all with lye.

600
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,055
It's not my fault that
the cop who used my bathroom

601
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:26,558
was very familiar with the
smell of rotting bodies.

602
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:30,595
I told them-- it was
my Lhasa apso who piddled

603
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,399
on the kitchen floor,
but they didn't believe me.

604
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,434
Murder is one part perspiration,

605
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:37,436
ten parts preparation.
Mmm.

606
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,204
I built this hotel
for the sole purpose

607
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,706
of hiding the evidence.

608
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,476
All of my chutes and ladders,
have you seen them yet, John?

609
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,412
Miracles of modern engineering.

610
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:50,149
Mr. Gacy here came
to the Hotel Cortez

611
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:52,183
when he was just a young man.

612
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,218
18 or 19.

613
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:56,587
I was living in Vegas,
and I wanted to see the Pacific,

614
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:58,889
so I got in the old Buick
and drove out for the weekend

615
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:01,559
and stayed here--
six bucks a night.

616
00:35:01,593 --> 00:35:05,529
I showed him my secrets,
he was good, very good.

617
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,531
But imagine what he could
have accomplished

618
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:09,633
had he really listened to me.

619
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:12,027
33 bodies.

620
00:35:12,147 --> 00:35:14,238
He could have had 333.

621
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:20,277
GACY: Huh?
That's my trick.

622
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:21,885
The handcuffs.

623
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,815
Once I have them cuffed,
it's pretty much all over.

624
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,917
MARCH:
No need to worry, John.

625
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,394
It's the absinthe, dear boy.

626
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:35,525
When I was 19,

627
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,495
trucker picked me up
hitchhiking.

628
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:40,330
And that was before I knew
how to take care of myself.

629
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:44,034
That dick cheese drove
me all the way to L.A.

630
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:46,470
Bought me In-N-Out.

631
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:48,472
Tossed me to the curb.

632
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:50,540
It wasn't until I stumbled
into this place...

633
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:52,775
and met the master that I knew,

634
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,711
I knew I was
really worth something.

635
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:58,447
It's the first man that ever
treated me with respect.

636
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:01,584
Jeffrey?

637
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,285
You're even more quiet
than usual tonight.

638
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:07,323
I'm just hungry.

639
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:09,592
Ah, Ms. Evers.

640
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:10,827
It's always a delight.

641
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:12,529
Ladies first.

642
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:14,731
Please.

643
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:24,106
I don't eat salad.

644
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,708
AILEEN:
Jeffrey likes dark meat!

645

646
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:49,931
