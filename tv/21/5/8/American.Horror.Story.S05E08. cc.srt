301
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,110
你感觉怎样呢
And how does that make you feel?

302
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,040
当你用法律来制止犯人
When you collar a man as opposed to letting your fists

303
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,680
而不是使用暴力
be jury and judge?

304
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,410
如果由我决定
If it was up to me?

305
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,800
是的
Yes.

306
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,950
我不需要法官来告诉我人们是否有罪
I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not.

307
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,670
我很清楚
I know.

308
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,050
我相信你 约翰
I believe you, John.

309
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,650
如果他们放任我
If they took the leash off me,

310
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,980
罪行会祸害这个城市
crime would drop in this city.

311
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,420
我深信不疑
I truly do.

312
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,670
我们喝着苦艾酒
We drank his absinthe.

313
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,900
交谈了整整两天
We talked... for two straight days.

314
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,750
我们谈论法律和公道
We talked about the law-- man's law, God's law.

315
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,310
探索了人生的意义
And about the meaning of true purpose

316
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,180
还讨论了其他话题
And the meaningless of everything else.

317
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,830
重点是他帮助我遗忘
Most importantly, he helped me forget.

318
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,360
他就是要找的人
He is the one.

319
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,570
我现在不想要他
I don't want him, not now.

320
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,520
他被你的苦艾酒毒害了
He's been poisoned with that moonshine of yours.

321
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,070
我可没有让你享用他
I didn't invite you here to feed off of him

322
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,380
你这个变态
You perverted animal.

323
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,970
我需要你帮助
I need your help.

324
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,230
他是我要找的人
He... is the one.

325
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,850
其他被我指导去完成目标的人
All the others I've tried to mentor to finish my work--

326
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,260
盖西 拉米雷兹
Gacy, Ramirez,

327
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,180
基佬达莫[上述皆变态杀人狂]
that poof Dahmer--

328
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,260
和他比起来简直是新手
all amateurs compared to this one.

329
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,430
他不会干的
He won't do it.

330
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,960
为什么 他完全有能力
Why? This man has greatness in him!

331
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,540
难得一见的狂暴
Once-in-a-generation rage.

332
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,310
他不会轻易放弃
A man only has a grip as tight as he does because he knows that

333
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,260
因为他知道如果放弃
if he lets go, even slightly,

334
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,240
便会坠入无尽深渊
he will hurl himself into the abyss.

335
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,940
他不会放弃
He won't let go.

336
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,010
他仍抱希望
He still has hope.

337
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,070
这不是问题
Easily remedied.

338
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,310
只要稍稍助力
He just needs a little shove.

339
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,650
我很享受看到你受苦
Why would I help you when it gives me so much joy

340
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,860
为什么还要帮你
to see you suffer?

341
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,900
他有孩子
He has children.

342
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,280
儿子很漂亮
The boy is very beautiful.

343
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
如我所说
Like I said,

344
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,430
只需轻轻一推
He just needs a little push.

345
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,670
他就会进入内心最黑暗的地方
A nudge into the darkest places of his heart.

346
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,170
要让他憎恨世上的一切事物
He needs to hate the whole world and everything in it.

347
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,370
我不记得
I didn't remember.

348
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,940
和谁在哪里做了什么
Where, who with, what we did.

349
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,080
失去了时间概念
It was lost time in my mind.

350
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,210
斯嘉丽搭车走了 我要送霍尔登去上学
Scarlett carpooled with Wendy. I'm late to take Holden.

351
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,060
-咖啡有剩的  -亚历克斯 我很抱歉
- There's coffee, though. - I'm sorry, Alex.

352
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,360
你应该送哈恩一瓶威士忌以表谢意
You should send a bottle of Scotch to your friend Hahn.

353
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,590
起码在前几天
He tried covering for you,

354
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,310
他一直给你打掩护
at least for the first day and a half.

355
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,100
我没有背叛你
I wasn't cheating on you.

356
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,440
你当然没有
Of course you weren't cheating.

357
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,370
如果那样 你会给我打电话
If you were, you would have called

358
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,630
骗我你在哪
and lied about where you were.

359
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,490
你是个糟糕的丈夫
You're a terrible husband.

360
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,280
如果我们之间没有爱情和亲情的牵绊
If we didn't have two kids and I didn't still love you,

361
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,000
我早就让你滚了
I would tell you to pack your bags.

362
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,090
对不起
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,790
我疏忽了 仅此而已
It's just a slipup, that's all.

364
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,470
你好 小家伙
Hey, buddy.

365
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,990
爸爸 你会在家吗
Are you home now, Daddy?

366
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,650
当然 当然
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,030
我们今天下午去海边玩吧
Hey, what do you say we all go to the beach this afternoon?

368
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,850
我开车经过时
I drove by and saw there's a big carnival

369
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,680
看到在举行狂欢节
or something going on down there.

370
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,760
-好啊  -是吗
- Yay! - Yeah?

371
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,110
好了 该走了
All right, we got to run.

372
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,390
来吧
Come on.

373
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,530
我爱你们
I love you guys.

374
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,900
我们也爱你
We love you, too.

375
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,830
失去了儿子 我对一切事情变得麻木
Along with my son, I lost everything else that mattered to me.

376
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,170
繁杂的事务一直填补我内心的空白 直到无事可做
There was always something more to do, until there wasn't.

377
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,030
志愿者走后
And after the volunteers had gone,

378
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,540
家变得空旷
The house was empty.

379
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,330
我和妻子在一起时
I was never more alone than being there

380
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,170
非常孤独
with my wife.

381
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,720
你经历太多糟糕的事 约翰
You went through a boatload of shit, John.

382
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,920
孩子失踪了
Your child went missing.

383
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,590
但你挺了过来
But you got through it.

384
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,420
振作了起来
You pulled yourself together.

385
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,060
我不再是从前的自己
I was never the same again.

386
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,730
只有一个地方
There was only one place

387
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,670
能让我感到平静
I could feel any measure of peace.

388
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,910
在那里我可以忘了自己
A place where I could lose myself

389
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,460
不必醒来
and never be found.

390
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,920
我开始过两种不同的生活
I began to live two different lives.

391
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,190
完全对立开来
Completely separate from each other.

392
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,950
一种是和亚历克斯在家
One at home with Alex.

393
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,980
每分钟都非常煎熬
Where a minute lasted every bit of 60 seconds.

394
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,200
另一种是和詹姆斯・马奇
The other at the Hotel Cortez

395
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,810
在科尔特斯旅馆
with James March.

396
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,560
每分钟都像是独特的旅行
Time had a way of making a different journey in that place.

397
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
就这样五年一晃而过
Five years went by like it was yesterday.

398
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,450
鹅肝酱
Foie gras.

399
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,320
酷刑所带来的美味让人惊喜
It's surprising how delicious a little cruelty can taste.

400
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,460
请慢用
Enjoy.

401
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,160
他的声音如同银丝绸缎
His voice was like a sliver of silk thread.

402
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,290
环绕包裹着我的头脑
A thin strand that would wrap around my head

403
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,810
用话语探究我的内心
Before burrowing inside me with his ideas.

404
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,670
约翰
John,

405
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,530
你知道我们之间的区别吗
Do you know the difference between you and I?

406
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,050
财富吗
Millions?

407
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,000
不是
No.

408
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,210
痛苦
Pain.

409
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,690
我已经放下重担
I've shed my load.

410
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,320
而你却像扛着袋石头
You carry yours like a man with a sack full of rocks

411
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,610
试着渡河
crossing a river.

412
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,440
一步走错 满盘皆输
One false step and you go under.

413
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,020
我认为你所遭受的痛苦
I submit you've received

414
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,130
从没有被公平对待
no justice for the pain you've suffered.

415
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,910
你被法律所束缚
You're constrained by the very laws you promised to uphold.

416
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,160
你看 这不是你的错
It's not your fault, you see.

417
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,580
你就是这样被训练的
It's what you've been taught.

418
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,710
我还有一大堆案件要处理
I've got 40 files on my desk.

419
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,630
能搞定其中一小部分就很幸运了
I'll be lucky to clear ten of them.

420
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,050
真正的罪犯总是逍遥法外
Real criminals never pay.

421
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,550
跟我来
Come with me.

422
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,890
我有新的要教你
You're ready for a new lesson.

423
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,940
我的纪念品陈列室
My trophy room.

424
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,700
这里为什么这么黑
Why's it so dark in here?

425
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,630
你并未准备好看它的全貌
Some things you're not yet ready to see.

426
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,160
都是华丽的动物
Magnificent animals, all.

427
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,230
这头野牛差点就乱步踩死我了
The bison almost trampled me in a stampede.

428
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,380
啊 对了
Ah, yes.

429
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,880
天呐
Jesus.

430
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,390
我的会计师 亨利
My accountant, Henry.

431
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,590
毫无疑问 他偷了我的钱
Henry was stealing from me, to be sure,

432
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,850
不过罪行不止这些
But he had so much more to pay for.

433
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,140
比如说口臭
Halitosis, for one.

434
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,110
你是怪物
You're a monster.

435
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,130
我要揭发这里
I'm gonna report this.

436
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,920
你可以揭发我
You can report me. But it won't take an ounce

437
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,890
但这无法除去你的痛苦
of weight off those broad shoulders.

438
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,300
真正让你不快的是人为操纵的道德准则
What's holding you down is a moral code contrived by man.

439
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,640
法律都是权贵们撰写的
Laws written by bureaucrats.

440
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,780
抓住我的手
Take my hand

441
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,360
从泥沼中爬出来
and climb out of that morass.

442
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,720
就因为法律规定
Three people died and they dismiss

443

The system, man.

445

John.

448

449
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,510
为什么愁眉苦脸
Why the glum face?

450
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,210
