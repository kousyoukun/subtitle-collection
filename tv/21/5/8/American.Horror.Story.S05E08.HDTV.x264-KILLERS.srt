1
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:04,910
Good bye, John.

2
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:30,286
She ran out
in the middle of the road.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,821
I never had a chance to stop.

4
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:39,666
She's dead.

5
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,344
It's time to make him stop.

6
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,080
<i>I really like you.</i>
<i>I hate to see it end.</i>

7
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,173
Where is he?

8
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,642
Where's who?

9
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:23,176
That monster
you've all been protecting.

10
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,023
The Ten Commandments Killer.

11
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,705
He's here! Wren told me.

12
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,180
Wren?

13
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,640
That girl is full of lies.

14
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:32,275
She's dead. She killed herself
trying to protect him.

15
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,877
Well...

16
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:37,113
she was old enough to
make her own choices.

17
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,817
Where is he?

18
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:43,753
I swear to God, asshole,

19
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:46,222
you touch me one more time,

20
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:50,126
I will cut your throat
while you sleep!

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,628
John.

22
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:54,397
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:56,765
The man I've been hunting
is in this hotel.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,300
She knows it!

25
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,469
You know it!
I'm tired of being lied to!

26
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,545
Fine.

27
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:12,114
You want to know where the
Ten Commandments Killer

28
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,149
has been hiding?

29
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:18,787
I'll take you there.

30
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:31,633
You might want to
take this with you.

31
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,758
In case you find
what you're looking for.

32
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,122
Is this a joke?

33
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,859
You're telling me
he's in this room?

34
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:02,096
I'm telling you
there are answers

35
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,665
on the other side of this door.

36
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:20,514
This used to be
where his office was.

37
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,516
Did you know that?

38
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:25,397
James Patrick March.

39
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:28,689
Many years ago.

40
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:30,124
James March is dead.

41
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,025
In fact, this is where he died.

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,860
February 25

43
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:37,063
at 2:25 in the morning.

44
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:43,035
We don't have to do this.

45
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,205
We can turn around

46
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,607
and walk out of here right now.

47
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,580
Go to the bar, have
a couple drinks.

48
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:57,484
Why did you bring me back here?!

49
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:02,888
Behind the armoire.

50
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:09,028
That's where you'll find
what you're looking for.

51
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,973
Jesus.

52
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,550
How long has this been here?

53
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,981
Since the beginning.

54
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,422
The hand of a thief.

55
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:13,392
"Thou shalt not steal."

56
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,394
Dead thief, cut off his hands.

57
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:19,063
That was the first one.

58
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:21,632
1926.

59
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,100
"Remember the Sabbath day

60
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:25,269
to keep it holy."

61
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:26,837
Teeth...

62
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:29,507
harvested from a field
of migrant workers.

63
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,077
"Thou shall not worship
false idols."

64
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,279
What was left

65
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:36,912
of Martin Gamboa's brain...

66
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:38,982
...after his skull

67
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:40,618
was bashed open.

68
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:42,520
No serial killer
has a 90-year lull.

69
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:43,787
If it's taken him

70
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:46,023
this long to find a successor.

71
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:47,958
Someone...

72
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:49,927
to complete his work.

73
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,062
"Thou shall not

74
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:53,496
commit adultery."

75
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,366
James Briggs' tongue and eyes

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,903
- taken while he was still alive.
<i>- That's bullshit.</i>

77
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,606
The parts cut out
of James Briggs are in the lab.

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,274
I catalogued it myself.

79
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:08,532
"Honor thy mother

80
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,447
and thy father."

81
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:13,150
The hearts of two
ungrateful children.

82
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:15,585
They murdered both
of their parents

83
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,955
in order to inherit
the family fortune.

84
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:19,522
The Rylance twins.

85
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:22,191
"Thou shalt not bear
false witness."

86
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,694
Gossip mongers.

87
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,563
After he nailed

88
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,331
their slanderous tongues
to their desks,

89
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:31,568
he ripped out their vocal cords.

90
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:33,970
"Thou shalt not take

91
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:35,805
the Lord's name in vain."

92
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,677
A false prophet who would go

93
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:44,180
on television
and vent his spleen.

94
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:45,982
So the killer took it.

95
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,818
John.

96
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:50,219
He...

97
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:51,921
He would have had to
have been bringing

98
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,589
these things back while
I was still here.

99
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:56,192
Who let him in?

100
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,627
Nobody let him in.

101
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:02,331
He had a key.

102
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:05,534
What?

103
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:06,535
Take my hand.

104
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,536
What?

105
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,539
John, take my hand.

106
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:13,843
It's okay, baby.

107
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,812
It's all okay, baby.

108
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:20,315
You're here with me.

109
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,151
With your Sally.

110
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:24,319
We are almost there.

111
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:26,054
There's just a little more work
left to do.

112
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:27,923
No. No.
John, John, John.

113
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,858
Stay with me. Stay.
No, it's not true.

114
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,194
This is my problem

115
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:33,594
with police officers.

116
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,630
All you care about is evidence.

117
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,799
Evidence, evidence, evidence.

118
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:40,368
John, look at me.

119
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:41,402
You're saying someone's

120
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,938
picked up where this...

121
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:44,439
this March guy left off?

122
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:47,208
I don't remember anything.

123
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:49,410
Anything at all.

124
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:51,746
<i>You have made yourself</i>
<i>blind to everything</i>

125
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,614
but what your eyes can see.

126
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:54,982
You remember everything.

127
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,217
It's not true!
John.

128
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,753
Everything you did.

129
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:01,556
And it's gonna happen again.

130
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,725
And again and again.

131
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,760
Wren.

132
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:07,762
You can't stop it.

133
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,963
No! It's not true!

134
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:12,065
It's not possible.

135
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,568
- It's not possible.
<i>- You've lived in my hotel</i>

136
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:18,204
long enough to know that
what is impossible becomes...

137
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,940
very possible here.

138
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,815
It's you, John.

139
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,785
It's always been you.

140
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:36,614

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

141
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,042
- Any sign of him?
- No.

142
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,518
He disappeared
in all the commotion.

143
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,487
Send someone out to his house.

144
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,956
Make sure
his wife and kid are okay.

145
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,991
Thank you.

146
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,147
Nice of you
to look after my family.

147
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,381
Jesus.

148
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,750
John.

149
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,688
You look terrible.

150
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,191
I've come to confess.

151
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,160
To helping this one escape?

152
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,461
Assaulting a guard?

153
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,899
We can make it go away.

154
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,834
And what about murder?

155
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,836
Multiple murders?

156
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,272
Ten Commandment killings?

157
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,207
Can you make those go away?

158
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,242
John, what are you saying?

159
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,744
Please!

160
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,279
You think I've lost my mind?

161
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:49,546
I'm here for you.

162
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,383
Talk and I'll listen.

163
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,319
I remember
where it all began now.

164
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:00,023
It all started

165
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:03,493
those first few days and nights
at the Hotel Cortez.

166
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:05,829
The first time you
walked into that place

167
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:07,497
was three weeks ago.

168
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:10,267
These murders began
months before that, John.

169
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:14,504
The first time I walked into the
Hotel Cortez was five years ago.

170
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:17,107
I know that now.

171
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,875
It was the same night we caught

172
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,710
that multiple deaths call
in Glassell Park.

173
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:22,145
The dead family.

174
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,447
Gunshot and asphyxiation.

175
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:29,785
I needed a few drinks before I
could bring myself to go home.

176
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,621
More than a few.

177
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:34,924
It's not as easy
as you would think

178
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,093
to find a drink in the middle
of the night in Los Angeles.

179
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:53,508
You sure
you're in the right place,

180
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:54,976
cowboy?

181
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:58,480
I heard this is where

182
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,582
a man could find
the best martini in town.

183
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,451
Well, then,

184
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,119
I guess you <i>are</i>
<i>in the right place.</i>

185
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,477
Another.
Oh.

186
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:38,652
Can I buy you your next one?

187
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,788
I pay for my own drinks.

188
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:44,358
It's cheaper than whatever
it is you want from me.

189
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:46,694
Just trying to be friendly.

190
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:51,131
Do I look like
I need a friend right now?

191
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:53,166
Well, yeah.

192
00:12:57,505 --> 00:13:00,607
You want to go to
a party upstairs?

193
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,545
Liz's martinis
are awfully expensive.

194
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,313
But they're worth every penny.

195
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:09,649
I'm not looking
for a party tonight.

196
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:13,152
I'm just looking to
drink myself blind and forget.

197
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,821
And I'm married.

198
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,524
It's not that kind of party.

199
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:21,961
Well, last call here
is in five minutes.

200
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:24,697
If you really want
to get as blasted as

201
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:27,534
you say you do, it's time to hit

202
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:29,569
the after-party
upstairs.

203
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,611
You look radiant tonight, madam.

204
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,517
Though I have no idea
how one would launder

205
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:49,121
something like that,
all those sparkly bits.

206
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,861
How is the outside, darling?

207
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,696
Tell me about one of

208
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,797
your recent kills.

209
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:00,333
All you ever want to talk about

210
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:03,069
are the kills. Pervert.

211
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,338
Damn it, who is interrupting us?!

212
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,213
I'll break the finger
who dared ring that bell!

213
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,679
Yummy.

214
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:19,617
What's wrong with you,
barging in on his night?

215
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,121
Not that I mind,
but a deal is a deal.

216
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:26,691
I get one night!

217
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,260
One night with her
the whole month!

218
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:34,265
Who is that with you?

219
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:39,570
What is this,
a... costume party?

220
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:41,739
This is John.

221
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:44,909
He's a detective, and
he's had the kind of day

222
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:48,079
that makes a man want to
drink himself to death.

223
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:50,848
Really?

224
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,950
Jimmy loves to hear
about the bad days.

225
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:54,785
I'm The Countess.

226
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,421
Countess of what?

227
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:57,854
With those blue eyes,

228
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,690
I'll be the countess
of whatever you like, baby.

229
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:03,460
Tell me, John,
was someone killed?

230
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:07,097
Did you have to
discharge your revolver?

231
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:09,099
No.

232
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:10,767
But people died.

233
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:13,437
Five of them.
Children.

234
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:17,641
And their father shot himself
in the head because of it.

235
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:20,444
Brains are still
hanging off the ceiling.

236
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:23,480
You speak about this
with such calm indifference,

237
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:27,317
as if life and death
have no meaning to you.

238
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:30,154
I'm a homicide detective.

239
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:32,989
What I know is that death
is the only thing in life

240
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,791
that has any meaning.

241
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:41,765
I was promised
there'd be drinking up here.

242
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,700
I'm thirsty.

243
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,334
Leave us.

244
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:48,404
I need to spend
some real time with this man.

245
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:50,473
But, darling...

246
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:52,508
it's our night.

247
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:55,378
Yes, dear, and usually
I would hold that sacred,

248
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,314
but there is something about
John that has drawn me in,

249
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:02,118
and so, therefore, I release
you from your service.

250
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,896
Good-bye, John.

251
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:25,340
Absinthe.

252
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,910
Yes, I know it's not
technically legal,

253
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,679
but no need to play
Eliot Ness tonight.

254
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,581
My name is James March.

255
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,883
I own this hotel.

256
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,885
What is that accent?

257
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,821
You sound like a 1930s movie.

258
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:40,188
You look like one, too.

259
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:43,092
Ah, yes.

260
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:46,394
I had a marvelous professor
at Exeter.

261
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:49,364
I freely admit that I
mimicked his Brahman diction

262
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:51,399
until I made it my own.

263
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:54,436
As for my clothing,
my choice of decor,

264
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,804
the modern world is an
awfully uncomfortable place,

265
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:58,573
don't you think?

266
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:01,343
Yes, I know the accoutrements
of modern living allow an ease

267
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:03,645
of communication, but the
price paid for that is

268
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,714
that no one actually sits
and talks over a drink,

269
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:09,017
like the good old days.

270
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,387
Down the hatch.

271
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:22,664
Some time ago, we
had a guest here

272
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:24,999
at the Cortez named Kirlian.

273
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:26,401
A photographer.

274
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:28,236
He claimed to be able
to use electricity

275
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:30,471
to photograph a man's aura.

276
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:33,140
I became fascinated
by these auras.

277
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,975
Over time, I began to be able

278
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,278
to see a man's aura
the moment I met him.

279
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:41,948
The moment you walked
into my suite,

280
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:45,886
I was struck by the
intensity of your aura.

281
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,589
See, most folks
radiate red or blue,

282
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:50,491
purple if they're
quite mystical,

283
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:55,262
but yours... was jet black.

284
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:58,399
Black as the ace of spades,
as they say.

285
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,100
What does that mean?

286
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,702
Two schools of thought.

287
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:04,270
One is that you have a
protective cloak around you.

288
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,305
It allows you

289
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:06,907
to focus on any task at hand,

290
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:08,641
regardless of
the other's judgment.

291
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:12,145
The other is that you
have a need to dominate

292
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,081
and control the world
around you,

293
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:15,882
bend it to your will.

294
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,918
That is a man who is willing

295
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,886
to do bad to do good.

296
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,255
You are full of shit.

297
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,325
And you are full of rage.

298
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,293
Dangerous to keep it
all inside, John.

299
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:30,130
It will give you the cancer if
you don't let it out sometimes.

300
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,065
Tell me,

301
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,701
have you ever roughed up
a suspect a bit?

302
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,036
Put him in handcuffs and then

303
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,637
forgotten to read
him his rights,

304
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:39,606
and then just given him
some good old-fashioned

305
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,875
justice right there on the spot?

306
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:43,210
You think I don't want to?

307
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:46,112
I feel your constant battle
to keep it in check.

308
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:52,600
I once walked in on a 273D--
domestic dispute in progress.

309
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,554
It took everything I had
not to...

310
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:56,922
pound this guy's face,

311
00:18:56,957 --> 00:19:00,826
make him swallow
his own teeth and blood.

312
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,562
Don't tell anyone that though.

313
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:05,464
Why not?

314
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:08,200
Why should you be ashamed?

315
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:10,669
You would just be
doing your job.

316
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:12,938
My job is to arrest them.

317
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,107
And how does that make you feel?

318
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:18,777
When you collar a man, as
opposed to letting your fists

319
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:20,812
be jury and judge?

320
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,483
If it was up to me?

321
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:26,318
Yes.
I don't need a judge to tell me

322
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:28,320
whether someone's
guilty or not. I know.

323
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:29,854
I believe you, John.

324
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:32,658
If they took the leash off me,
crime would drop in this city.

325
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,393
I truly do.

326
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:36,995
We drank his absinthe.

327
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,064
We talked for two straight days.

328
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:43,535
We talked about the law--
man's law, God's law--

329
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:45,437
and about the meaning
of true purpose

330
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:48,774
and the meaningless
of everything else.

331
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:51,943
Most importantly,
he helped me forget.

332
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,476
He is the one.

333
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:59,450
I don't want him, not now.

334
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:04,622
He's been poisoned
with that moonshine of yours.

335
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:06,857
I didn't invite you here
to feed off of him,

336
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,058
you perverted animal.

337
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:09,760
I need your help.

338
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:12,896
He... is the one.

339
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,636
All the others I've tried
to mentor to finish my work--

340
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,971
Gacy, Ramirez,
that poof Dahmer--

341
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,573
all amateurs
compared to this one.

342
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,174
He won't do it.

343
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,410
Why? This man
has greatness in him.

344
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:28,178
Once-in-a-generation rage.

345
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:31,582
A man only has a grip as tight
as he does because he knows that

346
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:33,083
if he lets go, even slightly,

347
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:35,953
he will hurl himself
into the abyss.

348
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:37,620
He won't let go.

349
00:20:39,157 --> 00:20:41,258
He still has hope.

350
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,960
Easily remedied.

351
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:45,162
He just needs a little shove.

352
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:47,497
Why would I help you
when it gives me so much joy

353
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:48,698
to see you suffer?

354
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:53,871
He has children.

355
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:57,274
The boy is very beautiful.

356
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:05,648
Like I said,

357
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,016
he just needs a little push.

358
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,085
A nudge into

359
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,888
the darkest places of his heart.

360
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,990
He needs to hate the whole world

361
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,893
and everything in it.

362
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,303
Mmm.

363
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:38,947
I didn't remember--

364
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:42,383
where, who with, what we did.

365
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,152
It was lost time in my mind.

366
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,264
Scarlett carpooled with Wendy.
I'm late to take Holden.

367
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,399
There's coffee though.

368
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,701
I'm sorry, Alex.

369
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,068
You should send
a bottle of Scotch

370
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,203
to your friend Hahn.

371
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,538
He tried covering for you,

372
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,206
at least for the first
day and a half.

373
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,106
I wasn't cheating on you.

374
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:08,975
Of course you weren't cheating.

375
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,777
If you were, you
would have called

376
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:13,279
and lied about where you were.

377
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:16,149
You're a terrible husband.

378
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:18,344
If we didn't have two kids
and I didn't still love you,

379
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:21,120
I would tell you
to pack your bags.

380
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,288
I'm sorry.

381
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:25,024
It's just a slipup, that's all.

382
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:28,328
Hey, buddy.

383
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:31,531
Hey.

384
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,167
Are you home now, Daddy?

385
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:36,002
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:38,037
Hey, what do you say we all
go to the beach this afternoon?

387
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,772
I drove by
and saw there's a big carnival

388
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:42,708
or something going on down there. Yeah?
Yay!

389
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:44,777
All right, we got to run.

390
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:46,812
Come on.

391
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:51,117
I love you guys.

392
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:54,053
We love you, too.

393
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,762
Along with my son I lost everything else

394
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:02,970
that mattered to me.

395
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:06,539
There was always something more
to do, until there wasn't.

396
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:10,443
And after the volunteers
had gone,

397
00:23:10,478 --> 00:23:12,946
and the house was empty,

398
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,151
I was never more alone

399
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:17,724
than being there

400
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,593
with my wife.

401
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:22,763
You went through a
boatload of shit, John.

402
00:23:22,797 --> 00:23:23,991
Child went missing.

403
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:25,598
But you got through it.

404
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:27,066
You pulled yourself together.

405
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,335
I was never the same again.

406
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:31,237
There was only one place

407
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,106
I could feel
any measure of peace.

408
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,508
A place where I could
lose myself

409
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,510
and never be found.

410
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:40,779
I began to live
two different lives,

411
00:23:40,814 --> 00:23:43,116
completely separate
from each other.

412
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,950
One at home with Alex,

413
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:47,152
where a minute lasted
every bit of 60 seconds.

414
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,608
The other at the Hotel Cortez
with James March.

415
00:23:58,724 --> 00:23:59,824
Time had a way of making

416
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:02,134
a different journey
in that place.

417
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,775
Five years went by
like it was yesterday.

418
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:13,345
Foie gras.
Oh.

419
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:16,849
It's surprising how delicious
a little cruelty can taste.

420
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:19,283
Enjoy.

421
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:22,020
<i>His voice was like</i>
<i>a sliver of silk thread,</i>

422
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:24,022
a thin strand that would
wrap around my head

423
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:26,423
before burrowing inside me
with his ideas.

424
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,425
John,

425
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,162
do you know the difference
between you and I?

426
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:32,930
Millions?

427
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:35,166
No.

428
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,201
Pain.

429
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,705
I've shed my load.

430
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,306
You carry yours like a man

431
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,176
with a sack full of rocks
crossing a river.

432
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,510
One false step

433
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,312
and you go under.

434
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,714
I submit you've received

435
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:51,649
no justice for the pain
you've suffered.

436
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:54,652
You're constrained
by the very laws

437
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:56,287
you promised to uphold.

438
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:59,623
It's not your fault, you see.

439
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:02,793
It's what you've been taught.

440
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:05,428
I've got 40 files on my desk.

441
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,331
Be lucky to clear ten of them.

442
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:12,368
Real criminals never pay.

443
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:14,404
Come with me.

444
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,975
You're ready for a new lesson.

445
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,284
My trophy room.

446
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:24,720
Why's it so dark in here?

447
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:27,389
Some things
you're not yet ready to see.

448
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,791
Magnificent animals, all.

449
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:33,495
The bison almost trampled me
in a stampede.

450
00:25:36,332 --> 00:25:38,600
Ah, yes.

451
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:40,969
Jesus.

452
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:42,971
My accountant, Henry.

453
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:44,672
Henry was stealing from me,
to be sure,

454
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:48,476
but he had so much more
to pay for.

455
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,845
Halitosis, for one.

456
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,413
You're a monster.

457
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:54,249
I'm gonna report this.

458
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:56,584
You can report me,
but it won't take

459
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,619
an ounce of weight
off those broad shoulders.

460
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:02,257
What's holding you down is
a moral code contrived by man.

461
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:05,093
Laws written by bureaucrats.

462
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:09,164
Take my hand
and climb out of that morass.

463
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,473
<i>Three people died</i>
<i>and they dismiss</i>

464
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:21,442
because of a technicality.
The system, man.

465
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:24,077
<i>March was right.</i>

466
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:26,079
The law had nothing to do
with justice.

467
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:27,581
John!

468
00:26:27,616 --> 00:26:29,742
You're a sight for sore eyes.

469
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:42,463
Why the glum face?

470
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:47,802
A splash of brown plaid
will set you right.

471
00:26:58,512 --> 00:27:00,513
He would have been ten today.

472
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:04,017
My boy.

473
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,956
So much potential
on the day of birth.

474
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,759
Should be a cause to celebrate.

475
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:14,794
Not a day to mourn.

476
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:21,034
Didn't work out that way.

477
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:25,231
Maybe it did.

478
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:29,008
Not for Holden.

479
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:33,379
For you.

480
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:41,720
To be reborn.

481
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:43,756
If I could find the man
who took him...

482
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,692
You would bring him justice.

483
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,827
There's no such thing
as justice anymore.

484
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,797
All I see is how justice
is perverted every day.

485
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:58,137
I want to share a story
about a guest

486
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,907
who came to this hotel.

487
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,841
He brought his nephew
to stay overnight

488
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:06,077
for a weekend of fun
at the theme parks.

489
00:28:06,112 --> 00:28:09,080
The boy bore
no familial resemblance,

490
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,488
as far as I could see.

491
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:15,721
Ms. Evers found something while
she was changing the sheets.

492
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:23,194
Jesus.

493
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:25,697
He's just a little kid.

494
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:28,232
Around ten, I would say.

495
00:28:30,636 --> 00:28:32,970
What room is he in?

496
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,972
He checked out this morning.

497
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:37,107
You're confused, John.

498
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:39,410
I worked the Gamboa case
with you.

499
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:41,211
He wasn't a pedophile.

500
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:43,981
But that wasn't
Gamboa's only sin.

501
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,025
I saw your ad on Craigslist.

502
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,061
You have the money?

503
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:14,644
There it is.

504
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,380
The thing that
dreams are made of.

505
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:20,817
The most important
award in the world.

506
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:23,453
And you can have it
for $5,000 cash.

507
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:26,222
Oh, it's heavier than it looks.

508
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:27,958
Y-You can

509
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:29,593
smudge it all you want,

510
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:30,994
after you hand over the cash.

511
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:33,229
Mm.

512
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:34,931
Yeah.

513
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,268
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave

514
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:42,138
and take those horrible
photographs with you.

515
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:44,607
You checked into the Cortez
with this boy.

516
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:46,275
Please.

517
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,112
I'm just a man
who likes to write about movies

518
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:50,279
on the Internet.

519
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:52,115
Where is he now?

520
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:54,150
Did you make him disappear?

521
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:55,551
No.

522
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,819
He's ten today.

523
00:29:56,853 --> 00:29:58,187
What are you talking about?

524
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:00,156
You destroyed his family.

525
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,292
Where's his justice?
Where's mine?

526
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:06,729
What price are you gonna pay?

527
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,665
I'm gonna call the cops.

528
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:11,700
Beat you to it.

529
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:28,283
Holden!

530
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:31,554
There's no such thing
as justice anymore.

531
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:02,665
It should have ended there.

532
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,932
Somebody cut you down.

533
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,366
I've had help, Andy.

534
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,736
And Sally--
she was always there,

535
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,139
like a shadow

536
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,174
dancing at the corner
of your eye.

537
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:20,575
She wormed her way in.

538
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,115
The way smoke
gets into your clothes.

539
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,183
Before we lost Holden,

540
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,892
the idea of cheating
on my wife, on my family,

541
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,095
would have been
unthinkable to me.

542
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:39,097
Then along came Sally--

543
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,599
a bottomless pit of need.

544
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,836
When I was with Sally,
I was someone else.

545
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,236
I didn't know
where she came from.

546
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,238
I didn't want to.

547
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,441
Man lying with man...

548
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:54,612
<i>She accepted me</i>
<i>and I accepted her.</i>

549
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,081
...through your generous
love offerings.

550
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,583
Christ,

551
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,451
how I hate this man.

552
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,953
Hypocrite.

553
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,120
Won't you pick up the phone...

554
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,823
Spewing hate
and calling it love.

555
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,292
...and call now.

556
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,355
I have to go.

557
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:32,392
No.

558
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,151
I shouldn't be here.

559
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,190
She knew I'd always come back.

560
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,728
And though I never
made any promises,

561
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,849
I think a part of her
hoped that I would stay.

562
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,472
What is the matter with you?!

563
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,974
I didn't do anything!
Precisely!

564
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:01,144
You were just going
to let him expire?

565
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:04,713
He's not yours.
Not yet.

566
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,582
Or have you forgotten
our little arrangement?

567
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:09,885
My protection
comes with a price.

568
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,187
This demon that you
and your kind have conjured

569
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:13,556
with your diseased acts
must feed.

570
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,391
If not on others, then on you,

571
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,226
dear Sally.
Fine.

572
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:20,229
I'll do whatever you say.

573
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,365
I swear.

574
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:31,239
I'm afraid.

575
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:33,042
What if he dies out there

576
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,509
and I lose him forever?

577
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:37,245
You're a clever girl, Sally.

578
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,116
Find someone who can
move in his world.

579
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:46,121
<i>This accomplice of yours,</i>
<i>this Sally,</i>

580
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,792
she look anything like this?

581
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:51,860
Yeah.

582
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,996
That's her.
Sally McKenna.

583
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,941
She jumped out of a window
at the Cortez in '94.

584
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,034
She's been dead for
more than 20 years, John.

585
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:05,707
John, can't you see
what's going on here?

586
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:06,908
Man, you're confused!

587
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:08,943
I'm not confused.

588
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,321
Something's not real.

589
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,744
When I leave this place...

590
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:24,285
I can't remember you.

591
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:27,762
Why can't I remember?

592
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:30,765
The Cortez is a
selfish mistress, John.

593
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:32,734
Jealous.

594
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:36,070
Possessive.

595
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:38,973
She will never let you
take anything with you.

596
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:42,977
Come on.

597
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:45,398
Come on.

598
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:02,996
I killed a man tonight.

599
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:05,999
And how did it feel?

600
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:07,794
Like justice.

601
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,138
Like I was punishing the
man who stole my boy.

602
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:13,106
But you tried to kill yourself.

603
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:14,975
Because I loved it.

604
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:17,178
I loved it more than anything
I've ever experienced

605
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:18,279
in my life.

606
00:35:19,314 --> 00:35:21,748
Of course you did.

607
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:23,450
And why not?

608
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:26,187
You're discovering
who you really are.

609
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:28,021
Your true purpose.

610
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:32,993
Everything's chaos.

611
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:38,130
It's up to us as civilized men
to impose order on that chaos.

612
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:41,367
Just as you did tonight.

613
00:35:41,402 --> 00:35:43,336
I lost control.

614
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,738
You let go.

615
00:35:45,772 --> 00:35:47,773
That's very different.

616
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:51,844
It didn't bring Holden back.

617
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:53,313
No.

618
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:54,847
Your son is gone.

619
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:56,449
And the pain you're feeling

620
00:35:56,483 --> 00:35:59,485
will never go away.

621
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,854
But you used it tonight.

622
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:05,358
You took your pain, and you made
the world a cleaner place.

623
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:08,327
That's a decidedly positive
first step.

624
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:11,996
I'd like to show you something.

625
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,034
Behold.

626
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:18,737
The unfinished work of
James Patrick March.

627
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:22,641
This was to be my crowning
achievement, my <i>Hamlet.</i>

628
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:24,909
Well, really more of a sonnet
when you compare it

629
00:36:24,944 --> 00:36:26,712
to my earlier work.

630
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:27,686
What I really loved
about this project

631
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:29,046
was its simplicity of statement.

632
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:32,083
The elegance of
a round number-- ten.

633
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,940
Which makes it even
more vexing I was never

634
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,871
able to complete it.

635
00:36:39,191 --> 00:36:42,229
Finish my work, John.

636
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,529
Make it your own.

637
00:36:45,564 --> 00:36:47,465
I'll get caught.

638
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,667
No, no, no, no, no.

639
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:51,669
You won't get caught.

640
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:53,738
Because you're
going to make yourself

641
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:55,906
lead detective on the case.

642
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,633
Do it in loving memory
of your only begotten son.

643
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:16,152
So you want me to
believe that wasn't

644
00:37:16,187 --> 00:37:17,554
your first time at
the crime scene?

645
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:19,122
My third.

646
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,058
When I killed him,
when I went back there

647
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:24,461
to remove the evidence,
and when you met me there.

648
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,297
John. Uh...

649
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:31,068
I thought Alvarez
caught this stiff.

650
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,003
The hell we doing here?

651
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:35,105
It interests me.
You really think

652
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:37,608
taking on an extra case
is such a good idea?

653
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,510
Mm.

654
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:43,747
Frankly, pal, you haven't
really been 100% lately.

655
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:45,482
I'm fine.

656
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:48,551
That's not what
your wife thinks.

657
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:52,222
She called me the other day.

658
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,159
Wanted to see if we
could meet for coffee.

659
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:58,961
You had coffee with my wife?

660
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:01,297
<i>She's worried</i>
<i>about you, brother.</i>

661
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:04,167
Says you disappear
for days at a time.

662
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:11,241
You had coffee with my wife?

663
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:13,783
<i>I know they're banging each other.</i>

664
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:17,706
She pushes me away.
Turns to my partner for comfort?

665
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:30,384
I'll kill them both.

666
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:32,102
March wants me to
finish his work?

667
00:38:32,222 --> 00:38:33,821
I'll start with them.

668
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,423
Mmm.

669
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:40,661
You cannot begin
by killing your own wife.

670
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:45,032
It has to be someone
they can't trace back to you.

671
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:46,500
Oh.

672
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:49,036
They meet once a week.

673
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:53,474
Every Thursday afternoon,
like clockwork.

674
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:55,476
They're both married with kids.

675
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,414
They met on Ashley Madison.

676
00:38:57,534 --> 00:39:00,581
She puts the room
on her company credit card.

677
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,817
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

678
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,228
They're in 53.

679
00:39:14,262 --> 00:39:16,163
They like to do it
in the shower.

680
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,302
The Emery murder didn't happen
at the Cortez.

681
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,637
No. It couldn't happen there.

682
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:27,917
Every act must be
dramatic, theatrical.

683
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:29,775
You must give it meaning.

684
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:31,270
But never here.

685
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,312
Never at the Cortez.

686
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:37,951
<i>Both victims had the same</i>
<i>text on their cell phone,</i>

687
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:40,219
each asking the other to
meet them at the Bel Air.

688
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:41,464
Only, they didn't send them
to each other.

689
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:43,420
Then I got their family photos

690
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:45,655
from the Internet--
social media sites.

691
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:48,218
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>And then I waited for them.</i>

692
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:57,488
You remember that big pharma
bust we had a few months back?

693
00:39:57,523 --> 00:40:00,128
I got the male potency drugs
from our evidence lockup.

694
00:40:00,248 --> 00:40:01,325
You can check.

695
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,096
And then I took his tongue

696
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,665
and his eyes.

697
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,400
We already know
that's how it happened.

698
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,405
If you really did it,
tell me something new.

699
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,720
And what about that suspect

700
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:15,690
you reported seeing
at the Rylance house?

701
00:40:15,724 --> 00:40:17,658
The man with the bowler hat.
You can't be

702
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:18,892
in two places at once, John.

703
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,971
It was me.

704
00:40:22,105 --> 00:40:25,365
I was seeing myself manifested
as James March.

705
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:27,967
Except you couldn't remember
any of this until today.

706
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,807
Listen to me, John.

707
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:48,821
Look, I know how bad
you wanted this guy.

708
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:50,890
And you feel responsible.

709
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:52,825
But you're not.

710
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,228
I know you, brother.

711
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:58,278
Now, you are a lot of things,
but you are no killer.

712
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:03,469
You're wrong.

713
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,080
Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife, Andy.

714
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,018
It's one of
the Ten Commandments.

715
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:15,780
Admit what you've done,
and I'll show you some mercy.

716
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,750
You don't deserve Alex.

717
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:47,011
To what do we owe this pleasure,
Mr. Police Officer?

718
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:51,448
Is it that obvious?

719
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,984
You must have
a lot of run-ins

720
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,752
with the police.

721
00:41:55,787 --> 00:41:58,422
Checking in?

722
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,425
I know who I am, Iris.

723
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,660
And I know who you are.

724
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:06,830
I've been coming to this hotel
for the past five years.

725
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:09,098
But now you remember.

726
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:13,336
Oh, thank Jesus.

727
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,806
Oh, it was exhausting.

728
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,340
Every time I saw you,

729
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:19,552
I didn't know which
John I was talking to.

730
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,511
Some nights,

731
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:24,948
I'd be so tempted
to set you straight, but...

732
00:42:24,982 --> 00:42:26,883
then I'd look into your eyes,

733
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:29,519
see the pain.

734
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:33,156
Didn't feel right
for me to add to it.

735
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,858
I wasn't ready.

736
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:36,059
Are we ever ready

737
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:38,862
to see ourselves
for what we are?

738
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:41,631
Yeah.

739
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:45,168
Sounds like you have no regrets.

740
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:47,136
None.

741
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:49,005
Except for Wren.

742
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,539
That one isn't on you, John.

743
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:53,109
Wren died because of Sally.

744
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:55,511
Follow him wherever he goes.

745
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:57,947
And do whatever you have to do.

746
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:01,117
Just don't let my man die
out there.

747
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:04,954
What manner of shit are you
trying to put in her head?

748
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:07,056
Language.

749
00:43:07,091 --> 00:43:09,325
Wren was trying to protect me.

750
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,228
I guess, in some twisted way,
we all were.

751
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:15,998
You know the truth.

752
00:43:16,032 --> 00:43:17,833
Walk out of here.

753
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:19,434
Leave all this behind.

754
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,216
You can do that.

755
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,677
Give me the key to Room 64.

756
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,719
Thou shalt not covet.

757
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:38,921
The instrument of adultery.

758
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:41,557
I'd say you took
the best part of him.

759
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,128
There's something different
about you, John.

760
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:49,764
What is it?

761
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:53,267
Clarity.

762
00:43:55,303 --> 00:43:57,338
Yes!

763
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:01,342
You can finally appreciate
the beauty of your work.

764
00:44:01,376 --> 00:44:04,211
Death is your art.

765
00:44:04,246 --> 00:44:07,314
I stand in awe of your talent.

766
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:14,556
But what will you do with it,
now that you understand?

767
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,258
Two more.

768
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:20,061
Splendid.

769
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,463
Then the masterpiece
will be complete.

770
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:26,300
You're home, John.

771
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:41,346
