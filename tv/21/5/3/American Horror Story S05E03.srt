Well, you might need one
in a minute.

498
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:20,579

499

505

for our daughter.

506

I think this is why Scarlett
is telling these wild stories,

507
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,522
'cause we haven't moved on.

508
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,993
I mean, a divorce?

509
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,579
I don't want a divorce,
I-I never did-- I-I love you.

510
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:55,081
And I love you, too.

But it's not enough,
not anymore.

512
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,584
I know it's been rough with me
out of the house, but...

513
00:28:58,619 --> 00:28:59,767
It hasn't been rough.

514
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:02,872
It hasn't been rough at all--
in fact, it's been great.

515
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,458
I didn't think that I
could do it, but I can.

I don't think you
should come back.

517

It'll just make things
harder for everyone,

518
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,297
because, in the end, this
is what we need to do.

519
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,799

520

tear this family apart.

our family apart.

of Château Margaux.

And then I met Bernie.

at separating people
from their money,

578
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:52,351
because he'd make you beg

years of living,

829
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:49,203
you may find someone
who treats you better,

830
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:50,772
who screws you better,

831
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:53,841
who makes you laugh
more than cry.

832
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:56,043
You'll never find anyone

833
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:58,279
who loves you
as much as she does.

834
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:16,419
(WEAKLY)
I'm not dead.

835
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,615
Jesus.

836
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,200
You're unbelievable.

837
00:49:20,236 --> 00:49:22,736
I gave you enough to kill
an entire marching band.

838
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,934
Plan B.

839
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:38,252
Jesus, Iris.

840
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:57,437
Shouldn't be long now.

841
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,587
(WHEEZING)

842
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:33,390
DONOVAN: Hey, Ma?

843
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:36,956
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

844
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,313
Ma?

845
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:40,769
Shit.

846
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,192
- Ma, it's Dono.
- (KNOCKING CONTINUES)

847
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:44,836
Hey, Ma!

848
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:47,268
She's resting.

849
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:50,407
Come back later.
I need to talk with her.

850
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:52,492
You leave her alone.

851
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:53,921
She's finally at peace.

852
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:56,026
No, Ma, no, no.

853
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,027
What did you do?

854
00:50:57,112 --> 00:50:58,144
I didn't do anything.

855
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,979
Nothing she didn't ask me to do.

856
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:01,281
No, no.

857
00:51:01,316 --> 00:51:02,982
No.

858
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,818
She...

859
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:05,985
She can't be dead.

860
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:07,487
She's all I've got.

861
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:09,539
Oh, come on, man.

862
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:11,991
You told her
you wanted her dead.

863
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:14,785
You bitch.

864
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,916
What are you doing?

865
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:22,302
No, don't do that.

866
00:51:22,337 --> 00:51:23,169
(GROANS)

867
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:28,007
Come back, Ma.

868
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,510
Come back to me, Mommy.

869
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:32,679
Come back to me.

870
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:39,018
There you go, there you go.

871
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:41,438
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah. Yeah.

872
00:51:41,523 --> 00:51:45,358
Now there's some twisted
poetic justice.
