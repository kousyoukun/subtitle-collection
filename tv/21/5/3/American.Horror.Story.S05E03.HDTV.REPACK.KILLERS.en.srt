1
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,943
I don't know if you can hear me.

2
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:37,366
I got to admit, you freaked me out before.

3
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:40,337
I didn't understand you, but...

4
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,454
I get it now.

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,093
Come on, man, talk to me.

6
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,347
I know everything about you.

7
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,798
I'm a fan.

8
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:54,049
Your name

9
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:56,853
is James Patrick March.

10
00:00:56,938 --> 00:01:00,222
You were born October 30, 1895.

11
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,275
You're a Scorpio,

12
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,563
which explains a lot.

13
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,067
You're the greatest serial
killer who's ever lived.

14
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:17,990
How do you know all this?

15
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,076
I Googled you.

16
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:23,495
That sounds obscene.

17
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,164
You were right, man.

18
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,882
Killing

19
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,635
is awesome.

20
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,180
High five!

21
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:39,929
Good. You've found your calling.

22
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:42,265
Then you can appreciate what I've built here.

23
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,516
Secret rooms, hinged walls,

24
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,903
acid pits, asphyxiation chambers.

25
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:51,394
Are you familiar with my Black Closet?

26
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,125
Yes.

27
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:14,229
There are places in my murder palace

28
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,253
that have sat in cold neglect for far too long.

29
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:21,221
You can put them to good use, old boy.

30
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:22,472
I'm listening.

31
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:25,775
Good.

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,028
- Now...
- My God, look at this.

33
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:31,980
The whole floor needs to be torn out.

34
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,283
This space is perfect for my atelier.

35
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,201
It's gonna be sensational.

36
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:38,381
And wait until you see this room.

37
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:41,531
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,151
Visiting a friend.

39
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:46,902
I was told that nobody lives on this floor.

40
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,265
You're a squatter.

41
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,656
Tristan, you clean up pretty well.

42
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,247
I barely recognized you.

43
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,043
Thank you, Claudia.

44
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,085
What happened to your cut?

45
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:06,937
Get your paws off.

46
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,557
I'm not here to be a deposit

47
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:09,643
in your spank bank.

48
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,429
Owned, Dad.

49
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,098
Get out.

50
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,901
I'll call the cops if I
see you in my hotel again.

51
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,938
Models.

52
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,277
Tear this floor out?

53
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,663
Where will I launder the linens?

54
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,866
He can't be allowed to touch a single room.

55
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:36,203
Don't worry, dude.

56
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:40,223
I got this.

57
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:48,677
<i>It's hard to believe now,</i>

58
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:51,697
<i>but raising kids was never a
part of my hopes and dreams.</i>

59
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:54,882
<i>My friends with babies
only made me more resistant.</i>

60
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,435
<i>Their lives seemed</i>

61
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,553
<i>kind of dreary, to be honest.</i>

62
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,367
<i>I wanted to save kids, other people's kids.</i>

63
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,810
<i>If I'm honest?</i>

64
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:06,944
<i>Being the best pediatrician possible</i>

65
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,314
<i>was my only real dream.</i>

66
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:15,319
Okay.

67
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,483
We're going to get you to the hospital

68
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,415
and put you on a big fat IV

69
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:21,637
of antibiotics.

70
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:22,661
Okay?

71
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,863
We just need his slippers and his coat.

72
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,149
Wait, wait, wait, hospital?

73
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,983
This kind of pneumonia,

74
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,819
the one we associate with,
uh, the measles, is something

75
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,072
we like to treat, uh,

76
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:33,625
aggressively.

77
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:37,127
I don't understand why you didn't you call me

78
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,245
the second his fever went over a 103.

79
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:42,139
I... I guess I felt ashamed
after our last conversation.

80
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,992
You made me feel pretty terrible.

81
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:48,303
Please just tell me he's gonna be all right.

82
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,173
I hope so. Upstairs.

83
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,733
<i>By the way, I'm not unaware
of the obvious cliché here--</i>

84
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,353
<i>I wanted to save kids because
I felt I needed saving.</i>

85
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,689
<i>But in my case the cliché is dead on.</i>

86
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:10,552
<i>Suffice it to say, mine
was not a happy childhood.</i>

87
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,793
<i>Then Holden showed up.</i>

88
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:31,047
<i>It was a tectonic shift</i>

89
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,932
<i>where everything I thought I knew about myself</i>

90
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,019
<i>got rearranged.</i>

91
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:39,805
<i>It was like I finally fell in love for real.</i>

92
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:43,442
<i>All the cracks and missing
pieces came together.</i>

93
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,812
<i>I felt whole.</i>

94
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:47,863
<i>I'd found my soul mate.</i>

95
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:55,403
<i>I couldn't stop smelling his head.</i>

96
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,220
It made me feel drowsy and giddy,

97
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,557
like we were in the middle of a lavender field

98
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:02,327
<i>in the south of France.</i>

99
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,879
<i>The smell was real.</i>

100
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,415
<i>He truly smelled like fresh lavender.</i>

101
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,401
<i>It was and always will be my drug of choice.</i>

102
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,057
<i>I even wondered if I truly loved John,</i>

103
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,093
<i>because my feelings for him</i>

104
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,428
<i>were never as powerful
as my feelings for Holden.</i>

105
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:21,752
<i>And I've always felt guilty</i>

106
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:24,504
<i>because I never quite bonded
like that with Scarlett</i>

107
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,473
<i>when she was a baby.</i>

108
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,759
<i>It was a special kind of love.</i>

109
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:31,562
<i>Maybe a once in a lifetime thing.</i>

110
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,350
<i>And then he disappeared.</i>

111
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:36,466
Holden!

112
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,603
Holden?

113
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:40,687
Holden!

114
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:42,774
Holden!

115
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,332
<i>At first, every time you hear the phone,</i>

116
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:54,502
<i>you think they've found him.</i>

117
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,206
<i>Your heart pounds.</i>

118
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,291
Hello?

119
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:04,461
<i>Then after a month or so,</i>

120
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,214
<i>the phone is just the phone.</i>

121
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,932
<i>You do whatever</i>

122
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,302
<i>you need to do to soldier on,</i>

123
00:08:11,353 --> 00:08:13,603
<i>because, you tell yourself,</i>

124
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,639
<i>time is on your side.</i>

125
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,228
<i>And then a year has gone by, and you understand</i>

126
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:25,031
<i>that the next year will not be much different.</i>

127
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:26,951
<i>This feeling will never go away...</i>

128
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,321
<i>...'cause there is no getting over it,</i>

129
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,943
<i>there is no getting to the other side.</i>

130
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,139
<i>I do carry on.</i>

131
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:52,092
<i>Mostly for Scarlett.</i>

132
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:55,395
<i>But there are many days
when I don't really know why.</i>

133
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:58,482
<i>Some days are bearable.</i>

134
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,985
<i>Today is very hard.</i>

135
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,187
Alex?

136
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:05,155
You with us?

137
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,692
We haven't heard a lot from you, Alex.

138
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:12,822
I don't know what to say.

139
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,985
I'm afraid the truth about

140
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:20,337
how I'm feeling wouldn't be very helpful.

141
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,541
This is the right place
for you to speak your truth.

142
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:26,126
And the right time.

143
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:28,653
Honestly, I'm angry.

144
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:34,018
I mean, I don't understand, Scarlett.

145
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:40,057
It's like you're trying to hurt me.

146
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,121
Us.

147
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,566
I don't have the sense that
Scarlett holds any ill will.

148
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,067
Her stories strike me as being

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,070
more about wanting to alleviate your pain,

150
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:54,965
wanting the family whole again.

151
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:56,740
You're both wrong.

152
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,709
It's not about my mother or the family.

153
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,745
It's what happened.

154
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:04,631
Scarlett, tell us the story

155
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:06,333
exactly how you remember it.

156
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:07,335
Tell us everything.

157
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,927
Well, there's a room where
they all play Nintendo

158
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,980
and there are these big glass
things full of jelly beans.

159
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,700
That sounds like a fun place.

160
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,317
And he sleeps in the bottom

161
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:26,403
of a glass coffin

162
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:29,240
in the bottom of an empty swimming pool.

163
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,192
That's when I first saw him.

164
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,193
He was just waking up.

165
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,114
And when you first saw him...

166
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,450
and what did he say exactly?

167
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:40,951
Does he talk about us?

168
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:42,586
No, he was different.

169
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:46,123
He didn't have normal feelings.

170
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:48,292
And he smelled like

171
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,260
lavender.

172
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,346
You know,

173
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:53,965
like those candles we have at home.

174
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,336
<i>Yes, dear.</i>

175
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:00,687
Yes, the change of scenery was good for Will.

176
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,355
He was getting too stale in New York.

177
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:03,724
Yes, Jess.

178
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,308
I'm losing you.

179
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:07,278
Can you hear me?

180
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:08,895
Claudia, Claudia... Yes.

181
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:10,780
We need to get Mario Testino
out here to do a shoot.

182
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,283
Did you hear that? Jess?

183
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:14,818
Oh, darn.

184
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,254
No!

185
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,543
No! No!

186
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,049
Help me! No!

187
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,539
I got the guys checking
on Islamic terrorist groups

188
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,076
active in the area.

189
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:47,711
You know, this could be another

190
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,047
Charlie Hebdo thing.

191
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,921
This is a gossip site.

192
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,945
He stopped their tongues from wagging.

193
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,477
Thou shalt not bear false witness.

194
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:38,211
These people trafficked in lies.

195
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,380
They broke the commandment.

196
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:45,403
Have ballistics run a check
on the casings at the scene

197
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,284
with casings from previous murders.

198
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,826
- Yeah, all of them.
- Gotcha.

199
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:52,143
There may be a previous commandment murder

200
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:53,394
that we missed. We'll cross-reference.

201
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,812
I'm not sure, but I think...

202
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,481
Help me.

203
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,899
Help me.

204
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,682
Boo!

205
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,611
How the hell did you get in here?

206
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:25,355
I picked the lock.

207
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,222
When I was first starting out modeling,

208
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:30,143
I made extra scratch as a thief.

209
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:32,360
I'm not the waiting tables type.

210
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,230
I did six months for breaking and entering.

211
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,253
Did you know that?

212
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:39,318
Look, I'm sorry about the show.

213
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:43,155
I'm clean now, I swear.

214
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:47,125
You and I used to get along
great when I was clean.

215
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:49,162
You thought I was hilarious.

216
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:54,000
Every beautiful young thing

217
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:56,168
is hilarious.

218
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:58,837
And then you get old and you don't understand

219
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:01,174
why everyone isn't still
laughing at your jokes.

220
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,225
How did they fix that scar?

221
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,985
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

222
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,286
What are those?

223
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:23,817
They're the original plans for the hotel.

224
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:26,177
Well, they're the ones that
are registered with the city,

225
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:28,008
but they're not the plans for this hotel.

226
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,003
How do you know?

227
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:37,293
Well, for one thing,
there's that hallway on three

228
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,962
with no doors that goes nowhere.

229
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,909
And, uh,

230
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,923
according to these plans,

231
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,354
there's rooms off of them
and access to the stairwell.

232
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:48,075
So I think somebody submitted these plans

233
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:49,834
to get through inspection,

234
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:52,027
but then just built how they wanted to.

235
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,527
Man, you smell good.

236
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,613
You know that's actually the worst part

237
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:57,657
about being in jail?

238
00:15:57,777 --> 00:15:59,448
It's not the food

239
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,799
or being locked up like a dog.

240
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,956
It's the smell.

241
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:07,922
Everyone smells like shit.

242
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:11,975
Doesn't stop you from doing
stuff, though, you know?

243
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,368
A man has needs, right?

244
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,100
What is happening?

245
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,436
Hmm? What are you doing?

246
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,761
Stay.

247
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,046
Stay...

248
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:56,220
Another time.

249
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:59,222
What...

250
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:04,207
Looking at an O.D. here?

251
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:05,311
You'd think so,

252
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:06,924
but everything's telling me withdrawals.

253
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:07,981
I don't think this man's had

254
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:09,115
a needle in him in a few days.

255
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:10,150
At least.

256
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,652
The blood? Not his.

257
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:14,738
Let's get him sedated.

258
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:16,323
No! Please! I'm sorry!

259
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,826
I didn't mean it! Wait! Wait! Wait!

260
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:20,994
Please. I'm sorry. Wait, why are you sorry?

261
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:23,163
Detective. I didn't mean to kill her.

262
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,163
Wait, wait, who-who did you kill?

263
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,715
I thought it was the other one.

264
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,917
The junkie whore. Sally? Sally?

265
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,752
She did this to me.

266
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:30,971
She lied to me.

267
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,306
She said that I'd be free.

268
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,723
Okay, got to go.

269
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:35,226
Got to go!

270
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,179
We're losing him.

271
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,848
I hear she checked out.

272
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,305
Who did?

273
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,023
That shit-don't-stink
fashion editor.

274
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,560
Guess this place wasn't up to her standards.

275
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,994
Not everyone can appreciate it here.

276
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:32,711
All this lovely darkness.

277
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,315
You know what I mean.

278
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,070
No.

279
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:38,905
I really don't.

280
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,874
Why don't you tell me about your friend?

281
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,076
Which one?

282
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:42,903
The one at St. Vincent's.

283
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,211
Junkie, covered in blood, not his.

284
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:47,413
Oh, well, junkies.

285
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:50,005
You can't believe a word they say.

286
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:57,223
Who was he?

287
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:01,679
How the hell should I know?

288
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,153
Why are you wasting your time on junkies?

289
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:11,855
We only hurt ourselves.

290
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:18,528
It's not like breaking one
of the Ten Commandments.

291
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:21,582
What did you say?

292
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:24,284
What?

293
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:27,003
Didn't you go to Sunday school?

294
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:28,705
How about "Thou shalt not kill"?

295
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,933
Hmm.

296
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:33,126
Well, that commandment is
always translated wrong.

297
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,046
It should be "Thou shalt not commit murder."

298
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:39,298
Killing can be a righteous act.

299
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,269
You've been in my room.

300
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:45,888
No.

301
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:48,307
But if that's an invitation...

302
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,477
How about this for an invitation?

303
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:54,147
You're under arrest.

304
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:57,367
Goody.

305
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,123
I know you sent me that text.

306
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,125
I don't know how deeply you're involved,

307
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,660
or if you're working with someone,

308
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,996
or maybe just starved for attention.

309
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,415
I am starving.

310
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,238
You're starving, too.

311
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:18,005
I can taste it on you.

312
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:25,179
Oh!

313
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:32,568
Come on, Detective,

314
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:35,823
show me right from wrong.

315
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,813
I wanna help you.

316
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,642
I wish you could.

317
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,057
You'll see.

318
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,125
You and I...

319
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:14,595
we're meant to be.

320
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,911
Hey, Dono.

321
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:32,746
I've been waiting for you.

322
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:37,217
Look, you need any, uh, help packing?

323
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,970
I, um, I printed out some Craigslist ads

324
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:40,971
for apartments for us.

325
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:42,839
Some nice two-bedrooms.

326
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:44,799
And this one... this is...

327
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,677
Get this, this is the building in Santa Monica

328
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:49,730
where they captured Whitey Bulger.

329
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:51,597
Just look at it--
it's glamorous, right?

330
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:55,769
I will live with the addicts in shitter's alley

331
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,188
in a box in MacArthur Park,

332
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:01,525
covered in the piss and
shit of this horror of a city

333
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,442
before I even consider

334
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,244
living under the same roof as you again.

335
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:07,727
You're a drama queen.

336
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:10,166
Baby, this is our chance.

337
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:12,618
This is what we've been waiting for.

338
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:13,619
Listen...

339
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:15,622
Don't touch me.

340
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,173
She never loved you.

341
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,709
She was just using you.

342
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:21,044
I knew that cold snake would get bored.

343
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,105
Not because of you.

344
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:24,381
You know, because that's just how snakes are.

345
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:29,603
You really have no idea
how much I hate you, do you?

346
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:31,717
And I get that you never wanted to take

347
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:34,845
any authentic interest in me or my needs,

348
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:37,285
but I have worked so hard
over the past few years

349
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:39,664
to get you to notice how much I despise you.

350
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:41,698
Now, you hold on a minute.

351
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,458
I gave my life to you.

352
00:22:43,577 --> 00:22:46,852
You have no clue how hard
it was for me to raise you

353
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:49,705
and the sacrifices that I made. Name one,

354
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,625
one that didn't serve your
perverted view of yourself.

355
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:53,710
Your father.

356
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:58,414
You think it was an easy
choice, kicking him out?

357
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,134
Becoming a single mother at that time?

358
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:03,174
Nobody did that, but I did,

359
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:06,096
because he was nowhere near
man enough to raise you.

360
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:08,520
My father was the best thing in my life.

361
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:10,643
I once hid out in the trunk of his Buick

362
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:12,179
and he made it all the way to Bakersfield

363
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:13,931
before he noticed and took me back home.

364
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,983
Imagine that.

365
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:20,269
He didn't even know his own
son was in the trunk of his car.

366
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:22,615
The guy was an asshole; he was a moron.

367
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:24,523
Do you know, when you kicked him out,

368
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:26,526
he sat me down and asked me to promise

369
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:29,246
that when I was old enough I would run away?

370
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:31,182
I had a plan.

371
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:32,833
Oh, she had a plan.

372
00:23:37,423 --> 00:23:39,423
I went to an AA meeting once,

373
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:41,424
and after I stood up and shared about you,

374
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:44,427
people came up to me, hardcore addicts,

375
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:48,682
and they were like, "Wow,
man, no wonder you use."

376
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:51,086
Every choice you made

377
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:53,052
was a disaster.

378
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:54,721
Dad...

379
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:57,473
that insane vegetarian cult.

380
00:23:57,558 --> 00:23:59,526
The "Breatharaians" were cutting-edge.

381
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,394
They were using food as medicine.

382
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:04,815
I had so much fiber in my
diet, I shit my pants at school.

383
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,901
Fine, you make a list

384
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,045
of all the ways I have failed you.

385
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:12,038
And you know what I say to your list?

386
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:14,040
Shit on it.

387
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:16,876
Because my list beats yours.

388
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:20,713
Item one, I gave you life.

389
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:23,750
Item two, I saved your life.

390
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:25,751
I wanted to die!

391
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:28,721
Coke, crack, heroin--
none of them could do it,

392
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:31,090
so I decided death was
my only way away from you.

393
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:32,342
I chose it.

394
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:35,429
You hated me like that?

395
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,315
And you let me stay here looking after you?

396
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:43,069
A real mother would have
let her son die in peace.

397
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:45,271
She would have buried me.

398
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:46,940
And grieved.

399
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:51,498
What mother wouldn't have
wanted her son to live?

400
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,282
Wouldn't have done everything
possible to save him?

401
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:59,001
You didn't bring me back for me.

402
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:01,421
You brought me back for you.

403
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,290
I'm leaving here.

404
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:05,625
Tonight.

405
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:10,047
But...

406
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:15,134
...what am I supposed to do?

407
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,105
I don't know who I am if I'm not your mother.

408
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:25,557
Honestly,

409
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,435
if that is really true,

410
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,067
you should kill yourself.

411
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:33,737
You should do it even if it isn't.

I didn't mean to just show up like this.

425
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,586
I tried calling.

426
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:36,304
I kept getting your voice mail.

427
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,227
Yeah, the service in here is pretty much shit.

428
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,510

429
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:46,455

00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,407
You're fidgety.

434
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:57,942
No.

435
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm just... I'm just a little
preoccupied with a case.

436
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:02,622
You look terrible.

437
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:03,957
When's the last time you slept?

438
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:05,875
I'm fine, Alex.

439
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:10,212
Maybe you should get a real drink.

440
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:11,619
I mean, it's obvious you need one.

441
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:15,464
Why would you say that to me?

442
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:18,305
You're not in AA-- you don't
have a drinking problem.

443
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:20,435
You need to give up this
obsession with control.

444
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,692
I need to stay sharp.

445
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,778
Well, you might need one in a minute.

446
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:26,479
Why?

447
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:35,990
What is this?

448
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,166
I don't expect you to sign them right away.

449
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:40,444
You may wanna look them over.

450
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,481
No...

451
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:45,664
Alex, not now.

452
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,166
John, we have to.

453
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,134
For each other, for our daughter.

454
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:52,255
I think this is why Scarlett
is telling these wild stories,

455
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,422
'cause we haven't moved on.

456
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:56,893
I mean, a divorce?

457
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:59,479
I don't want a divorce, I-I
never did-- I-I love you.

458
00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:00,980
And I love you, too.

459
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:02,515
But it's not enough, not anymore.

460
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:04,483
I know it's been rough with
me out of the house, but...

461
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,666
It hasn't been rough.

462
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,771
It hasn't been rough at all--
in fact, it's been great.

463
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:11,357
I didn't think that I could do it, but I can.

464
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,359
I don't think you should come back.

465
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,362
It'll just make things harder for everyone,

466
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,196
because, in the end, this
is what we need to do.

467
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,699
Please.

468
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,117
Please, please don't tear this family apart.

469
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:24,336
I'm not the one tearing our family apart.

470
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,839
Someone else did that when they stole our son.

471
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:32,177
John.

472
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,516
John.

473
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,384
Stay. Stay.

474
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:43,390
Something's wrong with me.

475
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:46,692
I-I think I'm going crazy.

476
00:29:46,728 --> 00:29:49,645
I feel like I'm seeing things.

477
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,066
Let's get you back to your room, okay?

478
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:00,990
I'm so sorry.

479
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:03,826
That's clumsy of me.

480
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:05,795
You never need to apologize

481
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:07,647
for pouring a glass of ChÃ¢teau Margaux.

482
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:10,049
I was afraid you'd think this was too much.

483
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:11,417
Oh, you mean the dress?

484
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:13,752
The night out on the town?

485
00:30:13,838 --> 00:30:15,173
This nightcap?

486
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:18,090
You know I'm gay. I'm not stupid.

487
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:21,060
We're destined for something much more...

488
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:22,696
intimate.

489
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:37,576
What if I told you... Will Drake had to die?

490
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,086
Then you know the truth.

491
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,624
The well is dry.

492
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,375
So much for the West Coast influence.

493
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:07,523
I happen to think you're a genius.

494
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:10,692
But you've been comfortable for far too long.

495
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:12,724
You need to burn...

496
00:31:12,845 --> 00:31:15,448
so you can rise from the ashes.

497
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:18,902
Kill Will.

498
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,409
You're giving me dangerous thoughts.

499
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:29,828
All great ideas are deadly.

500
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:31,748
I feel the same way with you right now

501
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,409
as I did when I kissed my first man.

502
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,088
How many times have you been with a woman?

503
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,306
A few.

504
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:41,924
But they all ended...

505
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:45,310
...unfulfilled.

506
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:47,430
No danger in that tonight.

507
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,324
What is this shit?

508
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,162
Where did you get the balls
to eat out of my dish, man?

509
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:03,997
I'll call you later.

510
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,199
By the way,

511
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:08,201
you're hard.

512
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:30,306
So that's it.

513
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:32,307
It's just over between us?

514
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:33,776
Don't be such a child.

515
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:35,133
What am I suppose to think?

516
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:37,480
I mean, I don't even get
it. All he has is money.

517
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:39,781
Then you do get it.

518
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,233
What? You're rich.

519
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,153
I used to be.

520
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:51,661
<i>And then I met Bernie.</i>

521
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:54,047
<i>Madoff was very good</i>

522
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:56,665
<i>at separating people from their money,</i>

523
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,250
<i>because he'd make you beg</i>

524
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:00,170
<i>to give it to him.</i>

525
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:02,183
<i>All my rich friends got richer,</i>

526
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:04,500
<i>20% return every year.</i>

527
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,720
<i>But he wouldn't take mine,
not until he could get it all.</i>

528
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,261
<i>The stocks,</i>

529
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:11,885
<i>the bonds, the hotel.</i>

530
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:16,035
Finally went to prison. I lost everything.

531
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,605
So that's why you didn't want me to kill Drake?

532
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:25,294
Will Drake can't die

533
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:28,882
until after I marry him

534
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:33,786
and take every goddamn penny.

535
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:49,519
Jesus Christ.

536
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:51,354
It's no wonder you're in such a state,

537
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:53,806
sleeping five feet away from all this.

538
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,644
I don't do much sleeping anymore.

539
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,444
Which is why you're gonna take these.

540
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,614
Drink them down.

541
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,067
You don't have a fever.

542
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:06,903
You just need some rest.

543
00:34:06,988 --> 00:34:08,987
A few hours sleep, and
everything will be clearer.

544
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:11,157
Okay?

545
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:30,009
I'm so sorry, Alex.

546
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:33,429
I'm sorry I couldn't keep our family together.

547
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:35,481
I'm sorry...

548
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:38,016
I couldn't bring your boy back home to you.

549
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:43,773
I know.

550
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:45,942
It's not your fault.

551
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:48,027
I know how much you loved him.

552
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:49,778
More than me,

553
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:51,664
more than Scarlett.

554
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,032
John.

555
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:54,701
It's okay.

556
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:57,036
I never minded.

557
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:59,204
That's how I love you.

558
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:23,028
Let's have another baby.

559
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:25,231
Oh, Jesus.

560
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:28,431
What am I doing?

561
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,088
We still love each other.

562
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,612
The divorce papers are here.

563
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:38,494
If you have any questions,
just call the lawyer.

564
00:36:13,947 --> 00:36:16,164
Is this hell?

565
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,034
No.

566
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,751
If this were hell, I'd be the one

567
00:36:19,788 --> 00:36:22,922
in that awful Zara knockoff
that you're wearing.

568
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,829
Holden?

569
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:05,664
Hi, Mommy.

570
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,284
Get the lead out, will you?

571
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,641
I'm terrified of needles.

572
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,481
I just want this over with.

573
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:36,644
First, you need to tell me

574
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:38,539
why I should be doing you this kindness,

575
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:41,610
when I could just push
you right out that window,

576
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,030
even things up.

577
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,599
Oh, come on.

578
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,393
You're not gonna torment me now.

579
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:48,268
I think it would be good for you

580
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,347
to talk about why you want to die.

581
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,985
And to taint me with your self loathing.

582
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:58,980
It's not about why die.

583
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,032
It's about

584
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:02,483
why continue to live.

585
00:38:06,322 --> 00:38:08,489
I can't think of a single reason.

586
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,576
I guess I'm just not lovable.

587
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,128
Now, what's to say.

588
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,498
My own son hates me.

589
00:38:19,385 --> 00:38:21,001
He always has.

590
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:25,840
You know, I see people laughing and smiling

591
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,137
and I cannot for the life of me

592
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,344
understand why.

593
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,364
I just don't get the joke anymore.

594
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:38,768
I am the joke.

595
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:54,927
Hang on.

596
00:38:55,804 --> 00:38:58,103
We are going total bye-bye,

597
00:38:58,224 --> 00:38:59,590
right?

598
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:01,675
You swear

599
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,094
you don't have any unfinished business here?

600
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:07,014
Because I am stuck in
this place, thanks to you,

601
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,217
so I want to be one 100%
sure that when I do this,

602
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:14,693
I am done with your miserable old ass.

603
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:17,807
In other words,

604
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:21,394
don't haunt my hallways, bitch.

605
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:23,898
I want nothing more

606
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:27,534
than the dark silence of death itself.

607
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,958
Well, you've come to the right girl.

608
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:58,164
How many junkies

609
00:39:58,284 --> 00:39:59,918
did you feed on, Donovan?

610
00:40:05,074 --> 00:40:07,862
You're no good to anyone in this condition.

611
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:11,751
So I am gonna get that
poison out of that blood.

612
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:13,507
And then we'll see

613
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,617
if you can be of any use to me.

614
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:18,168
Who the hell are you?

615
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:20,503
Now, that's the wrong question.

616
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,452
What you should be asking is

617
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:26,126
who was I?

618
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,431
Somebody order room service?

619
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:33,802
<i>I was the queen of them all.</i>

620
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:37,583
No, we ordered hookers.

621
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:42,507
Get on your knees.

622
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:45,612
Yeah.

623
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:01,911
I don't get on my knees for no man.

624
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:03,030
Cut!

625
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:03,998
Whoo.

626
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,166
Okay, guys.

627
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:06,416
That looked good.

628
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:10,503
<i>I had come to Hollywood</i>

629
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,556
<i>with barely a high school education</i>

630
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:14,592
<i>and no prospects.</i>

631
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:17,644
<i>It wasn't long before I was a star.</i>

632
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:21,981
<i>My pictures grossed ten,</i>

633
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:24,652
<i>15 times what they cost to produce.</i>

634
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,300
<i>Somebody was making money.</i>

635
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,023
<i>It just wasn't me.</i>

636
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:32,492
<i>They call what we did B-movies.</i>

637
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:34,445
<i>I wanted more.</i>

638
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,632
A chance, Mr. Samuels.

639
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:39,449
That's all I'm asking.

640
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,036
Before you cast Jane Fonda,

641
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,755
just let me read.

642
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,257
The role of Sally Hyde is going to require...

643
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:49,293
A white woman.

644
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:50,710
A serious actress.

645
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:54,648
I'm very serious.

646
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:58,719
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

647
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:00,387
I've taken a room at the hotel.

648
00:42:00,472 --> 00:42:02,106
Why don't you come up for a drink,

649
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,224
and we can talk more about it.

650
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:05,393
Ramona Royale.

651
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:08,028
What an honor.

652
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:11,231
I've seen all your pictures.

653
00:42:11,284 --> 00:42:13,534
You should go.

654
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:18,155
Now.

655
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:25,606
What did you just do?

656
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:29,643
Saved you from making a humiliating mistake.

657
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,670
<i>All she'd done</i>

658
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:36,306
<i>was look at that producer,
and he'd turn tail and run.</i>

659
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:38,976
<i>Now she was looking at me.</i>

660
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:41,525
<i>But I didn't feel like running.</i>

661
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:44,648
<i>She was this rarified,</i>

662
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:46,317
<i>timeless creature.</i>

663
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:47,652
<i>She knew everything</i>

664
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:51,905
<i>about art, literature, fashion.</i>

665
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,358
<i>This was the world I wanted to live in,</i>

666
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:57,244
<i>and she promised
I could--</i>

667
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,778
<i>forever.</i>

668
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:24,387
<i>It was glorious.</i>

669
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:28,108
<i>She taught me I could be a lady</i>

670
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:30,610
<i>and badass.</i>

671
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:32,780
<i>There was nothing I couldn't be...</i>

672
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:47,411
<i>...except hers forever.</i>

673
00:43:53,385 --> 00:43:55,835
<i>Prophet Moses was in the vanguard</i>

674
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:58,505
<i>of those early, heady days,</i>

675
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,509
<i>back when Tupac and Biggie
were making some noise.</i>

676
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:03,677
<i>But he hadn't broken through yet.</i>

677
00:44:03,762 --> 00:44:05,730
<i>Which is why the record company</i>

678
00:44:05,815 --> 00:44:08,849
<i>put him up at the Cortez
and not the Four Seasons.</i>

679
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:11,235
<i>Mo was a poet.</i>

680
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,853
<i>And he was, without exception,</i>

681
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,856
<i>the most beautiful man</i>

682
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:18,858
<i>I had ever seen.</i>

683
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:20,360
<i>I always thought</i>

684
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:22,746
<i>she was the great love of my life.</i>

685
00:44:22,831 --> 00:44:24,280
<i>I was wrong.</i>

686
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:26,751
<i>It was Mo.</i>

687
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:38,045
<i>And I aimed to be with him forever.</i>

688
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:57,565
You ready, baby?

689
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,532
I'm ready.

690
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:31,264
It's sad.

691
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:32,766
He could have had a future.

692
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:35,152
Who the hell are you?

693
00:45:35,153 --> 00:45:36,237
Mo, Mo!

694
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,570
No, don't.

695
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:40,324
She must have really loved you.

696
00:45:45,782 --> 00:45:48,081
<i>What she couldn't have,</i>

697
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,483
<i>was one of her creations</i>

698
00:45:50,603 --> 00:45:52,585
<i>creating something else.</i>

699
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:55,789
<i>There can only be one queen.</i>

700
00:45:57,235 --> 00:45:58,842
She took away from me

701
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:00,376
the only thing

702
00:46:00,378 --> 00:46:03,514
that I ever really cared about.

703
00:46:04,268 --> 00:46:07,351
And I plan to do the same thing to her.

704
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:09,887
You think by killing me

705
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,521
you'll get your revenge?

706
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:13,356
Not you, fool.

707
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:17,061
Those babies she made.

708
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:20,913
But I need access.

709
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:24,985
Someone on the inside.

710
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,905
And that someone

711
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,824
is gonna be you.

712
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:35,496
She dumped me last Tuesday.

713
00:46:47,425 --> 00:46:49,342
You can go.

714
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:19,003
I thought you'd left us

715
00:47:19,038 --> 00:47:20,788
for good.

716
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:26,878
It's a pretty humbling feeling

717
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,146
when you realize you have nowhere to go.

718
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:31,148
And what's out there for me?

719
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:32,951
I've got no money,

720
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:35,954
no friends I can crash with.

721
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:39,684
Pretty hard to explain away
a 20-year gap in my resume

722
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:42,827
And I've got a floppy appendage between my legs

723
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,664
which keeps me from wearing pencil skirts.

724
00:47:45,748 --> 00:47:48,467
We all have our flaws, kitten.

725
00:47:52,672 --> 00:47:55,257
I thought you were an actor.

726
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:57,175
You don't have to have a résumé

727
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,394
to be beautiful or talent to be an actor.

728
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:01,849
Just ask Laurence Harvey.

729
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:03,681
I'm not an actor.

730
00:48:03,766 --> 00:48:05,067
Four years of auditioning

731
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:06,378
and I booked one

732
00:48:06,498 --> 00:48:09,436
<i>under five on The Colbys.</i>

733
00:48:10,492 --> 00:48:12,179
You need a little Moonshine.

734
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:15,242
I did get to work with Charelton Heston
though, not everyone can say that.

735
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:17,612
I don't even have a room at this hotel.

736
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:19,793
I have got nothing.

737
00:48:19,914 --> 00:48:21,782
No one.

738
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:22,735
For eternity.

739
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:25,836
No pity party in my bar!

740
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:27,626
Especially when the guest of honor

741
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:29,621
can't see that he's the luckiest man

742
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,976
who ever checked into the Hotel Cortez.

743
00:48:32,438 --> 00:48:34,762
You think you've tasted humility

744
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:35,847
out there on the streets?

745
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:37,599
You ain't tasted shit, young man.

746
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:38,800
I know,

747
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:41,219
because I have.

748
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:45,724
You should be ashamed of yourself

749
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:48,391
for abusing your mother. I abused her?

750
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,092
I do not deny that that
woman is horrible. Horrible.

751
00:48:52,378 --> 00:48:55,400
But in the next hundred years of living,

752
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:57,902
you may find someone who treats you better,

753
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:59,472
who screws you better,

754
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:02,541
who makes you laugh more than cry.

755
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:04,742
You'll never find anyone

756
00:49:04,827 --> 00:49:06,978
who loves you as much as she does.

757
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:25,119
I'm not dead.

758
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:27,315
Jesus.

759
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,900
You're unbelievable.

760
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:31,436
I gave you enough to kill
an entire marching band.

761
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,634
Plan B.

762
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:46,952
Jesus, Iris.

763
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:06,137
Shouldn't be long now.

764
00:50:39,923 --> 00:50:42,090
Hey, Ma?

765
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:48,012
Ma?

766
00:50:48,097 --> 00:50:49,469
Shit.

767
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:51,891
Ma, it's Dono.

768
00:50:52,012 --> 00:50:53,536
Hey, Ma!

769
00:50:54,338 --> 00:50:55,967
She's resting.

770
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:59,106
Come back later. I need to talk with her.

771
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:01,192
You leave her alone.

772
00:51:01,277 --> 00:51:02,621
She's finally at peace.

773
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:04,726
No, Ma, no, no.

774
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:05,726
What did you do?

775
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:06,844
I didn't do anything.

776
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:08,679
Nothing she didn't ask me to do.

777
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:09,981
No, no.

778
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:11,681
No.

779
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,518
She...

780
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,684
She can't be dead.

781
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,186
She's all I've got.

782
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:18,239
Oh, come on, man.

783
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:20,690
You told her you wanted her dead.

784
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:23,485
You bitch.

785
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:28,615
What are you doing?

786
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,001
No, don't do that.

787
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,706
Come back, Ma.

788
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,210
Come back to me, Mommy.

789
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:41,378
Come back to me.

790
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:47,717
There you go, there you go.

791
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,137
Yeah. Yeah.

792
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:54,057
Now there's some twisted poetic justice.
