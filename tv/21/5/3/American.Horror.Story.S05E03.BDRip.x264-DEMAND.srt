1
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,373
I don't know if you can hear me.

2
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,039
I got to admit, you freaked me out before.

3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,913
I didn't understand you...

4
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,219
...but I get it now.

5
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,684
Come on, man, talk to me.

6
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,351
I know everything about you.

7
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,688
I'm a fan.

8
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,331
Your name is James Patrick March.

9
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,665
You were born October 30th, 1895.

10
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,767
You're a Scorpio...

11
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,377
...which explains a lot.

12
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:12,013
You're the greatest serial killer
who's ever lived.

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,046
How do you know all this?

14
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,923
I Googled you.

15
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,350
That sounds obscene.

16
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,052
You were right, man.

17
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,593
Killing is awesome.

18
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,805
High five!

19
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,703
Good. You've found your calling.

20
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,107
Then you can appreciate
what I've built here.

21
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:47,651
Secret rooms, hinged walls,
acid pits, asphyxiation chambers.

22
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,283
Are you familiar with my black closet?

23
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,073
Yes.

24
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,742
There are places in my murder palace
that have sat in cold neglect for far too long.

25
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,344
You can put them to good use, old boy.
I'm listening.

26
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,447
Good.

27
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,650
Now--
- My God, look at this.

28
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:34,263
The whole floor needs to be torn out.
This space is perfect for my atelier.

29
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,764
It's gonna be sensational.

30
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,664
And wait until you see this room.

31
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,030
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,601
Visiting a friend.

33
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,433
I was told that nobody lives
on this floor.

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,977
You're a squatter.

35
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,172
Tristan, you clean up pretty well.

36
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,975
I barely recognized you.

37
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,311
Thank you, Claudia.

38
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,954
What happened to your cut?

39
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,824
Get your paws off.

40
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,194
I'm not here to be a deposit
in your spank bank.

41
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,063
Heh, heh. Owned, Dad.

42
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:18,537
Get out. I'll call the cops
if I see you in my hotel again.

43
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,571
Models.

44
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,709
Tear this floor out?

45
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,480
Where will I launder the linens?

46
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,386
He can't be allowed
to touch a single room.

47
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,493
Don't worry, dude.

48
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,661
I got this.

49
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,166
<i>It's hard to believe now...</i>

50
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,806
<i>"but raising kids was nave: a part
of my hopes and dreams.</i>

51
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,640
<i>My friends with babies
only made me more resistant.</i>

52
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,180
<i>Their lives seemed kind of dreary,
to be honest.</i>

53
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,278
<i>I wanted 10 save kids...</i>

54
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,349
<i>mother people's kids.</i>

55
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,453
<i>h' Pm honest...</i>

56
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,751
<i>...being the best pediatrician possible
was my only real dream.</i>

57
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,593
Okay,

58
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,196
We're gonna get you to the hospital...

59
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,132
...put you on a big fat IV of antibiotics.

60
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,328
Okay?

61
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,664
We just need his slippers
and his coat.

62
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,104
Wait, wait, wait. Hospital?

63
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,438
This kind of pneumonia,
the one we associate with the measles...

64
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,547
...is something we like to treat...

65
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,875
...aggressively.

66
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,443
I don't understand why you didn't call me
the second his fever went over 103.

67
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,645
I guess I just felt ashamed.

68
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,219
After our last conversation,
you made me feel pretty terrible.

69
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,722
Please just tell me
he's gonna be all right.

70
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,666
I hope so. Upstairs.

71
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,070
<i>By the way, I'm not unaware
of the obvious cliche' here.</i>

72
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,004
<i>§ wanted to save kids
because I felt I needed saving.</i>

73
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,013
<i>Bu! in my case the cliche' is dead-on.</i>

74
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,652
<i>Suffice it to say,
mine was not a happy childhood.</i>

75
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,096
<i>Then Holden showed up.</i>

76
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,330
<i>It was a tectonic shift...</i>

77
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,573
<i>...where everything I thought
I knew about myself got rearranged.</i>

78
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,508
<i>It was like I finally fell in love for real.</i>

79
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,241
<i>All the cracks and missing pieces
came together.</i>

80
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,354
<i>I felt whole.</i>

81
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,421
<i>I'd found my sou! mate.</i>

82
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,257
<i>I couldn't stop smelling his head.</i>

83
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,900
<i>It made me feel drowsy and giddy.</i>

84
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,799
<i>Like we were in the middle of a lavender field
in the south of France.</i>

85
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,064
<i>The smell was real.</i>

86
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,868
<i>He truly smelled like fresh lavender.</i>

87
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,911
<i>It was and always will be my drug of choice.</i>

88
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,377
<i>I even wondered if I truly loved John...</i>

89
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,818
<i>...because my feelings for him were never
as powerful as my feelings for Holden.</i>

90
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,548
<i>And I've always felt guilty.</i>

91
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:30,889
<i>Because I never quite bonded
like that with Scarlett when she was a baby.</i>

92
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,762
<i>It was a special kind of love.</i>

93
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,992
<i>Maybe</i> a <i>once-in-a-lifetime thing.</i>

94
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,595
<i>And then he disappeared.</i>

95
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,794
<i><i>Holden!</i>

96
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,902
Holden!

97
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,735
Holden.

98
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,404
Holden!

99
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,822
<i>At first, every time you hear the phone,
you think they've found him.</i>

100
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,491
<i>Your hear! pounds.</i>

101
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,995
Hello'?

102
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,496
<i>Then after a month or so...</i>

103
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,598
<i>...the phone is just the phone.</i>

104
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,602
<i>You do whatever you need to do
to soldier on.</i>

105
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,866
<i>Because you tell yourself...</i>

106
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,136
<i>"lime is on your side,.</i>

107
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,344
<i>And then a year has gone by
and you understand...</i>

108
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,877
<i>...that the next year
will not be much different.</i>

109
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,785
<i>This feeling will never go away.</i>

110
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,153
<i>Because there is no getting over it.</i>

111
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,159
<i>There is no getting to the other side.</i>

112
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,342
<i>I do carry on.</i>

113
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,004
<i>Mostly for Scarlett.</i>

114
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,680
<i>But there are many days
when I don't really know why.</i>

115
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,983
<i>Same days are bearable.</i>

116
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,182
<i>Today is very hard.</i>

117
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,387
Alex?

118
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,357
Are you with us?

119
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,153
We haven't heard a lot from you, Alex.

120
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,091
I don't know what to say.

121
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,537
I'm afraid the truth about how I'm feeling
wouldn't be very helpful.

122
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,842
This is the right place
for you to speak your truth.

123
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,072
And the right time.

124
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,912
Honestly, I'm angry.

125
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,579
I mean, I don'! understand, Scarlett.

126
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,518
It's like...

127
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,090
...you're trying to hurt me.

128
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,357
Us.

129
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,898
I don't have the sense
that Scarlett holds any ill will.

130
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,735
Her stories strike me <i>as</i> being more about
wanting to alleviate your pain.

131
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,808
Wanting the family whole again.

132
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,970
You're both wrong.
It's not about my mother or the family.

133
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,241
It's what happened.

134
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,078
Scarlett.

135
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,618
Tell us the story
exactly how you remember it.

136
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,882
Tell us everything.

137
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,097
Well, there's a room
where they all play Nintendo...

138
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,258
...and there are these big glass things
full of jelly beans.

139
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,730
That sounds like a fun place.

140
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,169
And he sleeps in the bottom...

141
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,637
...of a glass coffin.

142
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,573
In the bottom of an empty swimming pool.

143
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,940
That's when I first saw him.

144
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,509
He was just waking up.

145
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,607
And when you first saw him...

146
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,752
...what did he say exactly?

147
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,249
Does he talk about us?

148
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,754
No, he was different.

149
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,356
He didn't have normal feelings.

150
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,520
And he smelt like...

151
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,528
...lavender.

152
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,358
You know, like those candles
we have at home.

153
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,496
Yes, dear.

154
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,969
Yes, the change of scenery
was good for Will.

155
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,940
He was getting too stale in New York.

156
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,170
Yes, Jess.

157
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,540
I'm losing you.

158
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,443
Can you hear me?

159
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,015
Claudia, Claudia--
Jess.

160
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,619
We need to get Mario Testino out here
to do a shoot.

161
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,482
Did you hear that? Jess?

162
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,214
Oh, darn.

163
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,103
No! No!

164
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,278
Help me! No!

165
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:49,437
I got the guys checking on
Islamic terrorist groups active in the area.

166
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,280
You know...

167
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,577
...this could be another Charlie Heb-do thing.

168
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,320
This is a gossip site.

169
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,341
He stopped their tongues from wagging.

170
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,455
Thou shalt not bear false witness.

171
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,429
These people trafficked in lies.

172
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,265
They broke the commandment.

173
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,101
Have Ballistics run a check
on the casings at the scene...

174
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,334
- ...with casings from previous murders.
<i>- All?</i>

175
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,341
- Yeah, all of them.
- Gotcha.

176
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,639
There may be a commandment murder
we missed.

177
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,147
<i>We'll</i> cross-reference.
I'm not sure, but--

178
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,182
Help me.

179
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,133
Boo!

180
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,471
How the hell did you get in here?

181
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,547
I picked the lock.

182
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:37,245
When I was first starting out modeling,
I made extra scratch as a thief.

183
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,914
I'm not the waiting-tables type.

184
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,758
I did six months for breaking-and-entering.
Did you know that?

185
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,820
Look, I'm sorry about the show.

186
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,826
I'm clean now, I swear.

187
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,702
You and I used to get along great
when I was clean.

188
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,435
You thought I was hilarious.

189
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,609
Every beautiful young thing is hilarious.

190
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,286
And then you get old and you don't understand
why everyone isn't still laughing at your jokes.

191
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,684
How did they fix that scan'?

192
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,194
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

193
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,130
What are those?

194
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,866
They're the original plans for the hotel.

195
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,104
They're the ones that are registered
with the city, but not the plans for this hotel.

196
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,304
How do you know?

197
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:48,085
Well, for one thing, there's that hallway
on three with no doors that goes nowhere.

198
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:54,425
And according to these plans, there's rooms
off of them and access to the stairwell.

199
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,589
So I think somebody submitted
these plans...

200
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,760
...to get through inspection
then just built how they wanted to.

201
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,569
Man, you smell good.

202
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,406
You know, that's actually the worst part
about being in jail.

203
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,576
It's not the food...

204
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,440
...or being locked up like a dog.

205
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,811
It's the smell.

206
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,350
Everyone smells like shit.

207
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,619
Doesn't stop you from doing stuff,
though, you know?

208
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,320
A man has needs, right?

209
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,661
What is this? What is happening?

210
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,929
What are you doing?

211
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,024
Stay.

212
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,895
Another time.

213
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,167
What?

214
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,638
Son of a--

215
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,967
Looking at an OD here?

216
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,543
You'd think, but everything's
telling me withdrawal.

217
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,738
I don't think he's had a needle in him
in a few days, at least.

218
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,315
The blood?
Not his.

219
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,414
Let's get him sedated.

220
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,021
No! Please! I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

221
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,383
Wait. Wait.

222
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,548
Please. I'm sorry.
Why are you sorry?

223
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,716
Detective.
I didn't mean to kill her.

224
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,887
Wait. Who did you kill?
I thought it was the other one.

225
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,192
- The junkie whore.
- Sally? Sally?

226
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,493
She did this to me.

227
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,933
She lied to me. She said that I'd be free.

228
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,864
Okay, gotta go. Gotta go!

229
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,871
We're losing him.

230
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,611
I hear she checked out.

231
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,581
Who did?
That shit-don't-stink fashion editor.

232
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,124
Guess this place wasn't up to her standards.

233
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,289
Not everyone can appreciate it here.

234
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,730
All this lovely darkness.

235
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,393
You know what I mean.

236
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,461
No. I really don't.

237
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,772
Why don't you tell me about your friend.
Which one?

238
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,842
The one at St. Vincent's.
Junkie, covered in blood, not his.

239
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,502
Oh, well, junkies...

240
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,477
...you can't believe a word they say.

241
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,116
Who was he?

242
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,189
How the hell should I know?

243
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,632
Why are you wasting your time on junkies?

244
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,633
We only hurt ourselves.

245
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,299
It's not like breaking
one of the Ten Commandments.

246
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,003
What did you say?

247
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,546
What?

248
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,709
Didn't you go to Sunday school?

249
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,787
How about thou shalt not kill?
Hm.

250
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,719
Well, that commandment
is always translated wrong.

251
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,721
It should be,
thou shalt not commit murder.

252
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,989
Killing can be a righteous act.

253
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:50,894
You've been in my room.

254
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,393
No.

255
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,872
But if that's an invitation...

256
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,167
How about this for an invitation?

257
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,678
You're under arrest.

258
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,171
Goody.

259
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,645
I know you sent me that text.
I don't know how deeply you're involved...

260
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,851
...or if you're working with someone,
or maybe you're just starved for attention.

261
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,087
I am starving.

262
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,031
You're starving too.

263
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,834
I can taste it on you.

264
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,182
Come on, detective...

265
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,576
...show me right from wrong.

266
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,933
I wanna help you.

267
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,634
I wish you could.

268
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,883
You'll see.

269
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,783
You and I...

270
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,553
...we're meant to be.

271
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,503
<i>Hey, Dons.</i>

272
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,575
I've been waiting for you.

273
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,914
Look, you need any help packing?

274
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,643
I printed out some Craigslist ads
for apartments for us.

275
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,754
Some nice two-bedrooms.

276
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,945
And this one.

277
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:55,251
This is-- Get this. This is the building
in Santa Monica...

278
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,416
...where they captured Whitey Bulger.

279
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,187
Look at it. It's glamorous, right?

280
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,365
I will live with the addicts in shitter's alley.

281
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,627
In a box in MacArthur Park...

282
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,204
...covered in the piss and shit
of this horror of a city...

283
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,934
...before I even consider living
under the same roof as you again.

284
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,136
You're a drama queen.

285
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,475
Baby, this is our chance.

286
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,310
This is what we've been waiting for.

287
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,310
Listen--
Don't touch me.

288
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,011
She never loved you.

289
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,315
She was just using you.

290
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,984
I knew that cold snake would get bored.
Not because of you.

291
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,959
You know,
because that's just how snakes are.

292
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,123
You really have no idea
how much I hate you, do you?

293
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:42,795
And I get that you never wanted to take
any authentic interest in me or my needs.

294
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:47,308
I have worked so hard over the past few years
to get you to notice how much I despise you.

295
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,503
Now, you hold on a minute.

296
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,147
I gave my life to you.

297
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:56,184
You have no clue how hard it was for me
to raise you and the sacrifices that I made.

298
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,514
Name one.

299
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,418
One that didn't serve
your perverted view of yourself.

300
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,656
Your father.

301
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,692
You think it was an easy choice,
kicking him out?

302
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,889
Becoming a single mother at that time?

303
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,158
Nobody did that.

304
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,065
But I did, because he was nowhere near
man enough to raise you.

305
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,103
My father was the best thing in my life.

306
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,871
I once hid in the trunk. of his Buick
and he made it to Bakersfield...

307
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,705
...before he noticed and took me back home.

308
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:24,773
Imagine that.

309
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,077
He didn't even know his own son
was in the trunk of his car.

310
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,117
The guy was an asshole.
He was a moron.

311
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,719
Do you know, when you kicked him out...

312
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:37,349
...he sat me down and asked me to promise
that when I was old enough, I would run away?

313
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,725
I had a plan.
Oh, she had a plan.

314
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,032
I went to an AA meeting once.

315
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,036
After I stood up and shared about you,
people came up to me.

316
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,202
Hardcore addicts,
and they were like:

317
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,312
"Wow, man. No wonder you use."

318
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,945
Every choice you made was a disaster.

319
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,312
Dad.

320
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,114
That insane vegetarian cult.

321
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,986
The Breatharians were cutting-edge.
They were using food <i>as</i> medicine.

322
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,561
I had so much fiber in my diet,
I shit my pants at school.

323
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:13,753
Fine.

324
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,421
You make a list...

325
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,090
...of all the ways I have failed you.

326
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,898
And you know what I say to your list?
Shit on it.

327
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,564
Because my list beats yours.

328
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,471
Item one...

329
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,904
...I gave you life.

330
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:33,278
Item two, I saved your life.
I wanted to die!

331
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:36,413
Coke, crack, heroin,
none of them could do it.

332
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:40,022
So I decided death was my only way
away from you. I chose it.

333
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,183
You hated me like that?

334
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,925
And you let me stay here
looking after you?

335
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,764
A real mother would have
let her son die in peace.

336
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,960
She would have buried me.

337
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,597
And grieved.

338
00:24:56,095 --> 00:25:00,100
What mother wouldn't have wanted
her son to live?

339
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,940
Wouldn't have done
everything possible to save him?

340
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,612
You didn't bring me back for me.

341
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,175
You brought me back
for you.

342
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,949
I'm leaving here.

343
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,954
Tonight.

344
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,624
But...

345
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,726
...what am I supposed to do?

346
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,892
I don't know who I am
if I'm not your mother.

347
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,804
Honestly...

348
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,573
...if that is really true...

349
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,976
...you should kill yourself.

350
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,151
You should do it even if it isn't.

351
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,752
Oh...

352
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,374
<i>Listen to the girl</i>

353
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,610
<i>As she takes on half the world</i>

354
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,709
<i>Moving up and so alive</i>

355
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,252
<i>in he: honey dripping</i>

356
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,451
<i>Beehive</i>

357
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,361
<i>Beehive</i>

358
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:30,124
<i>R's good, so good, ifs so good, so good</i>

359
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,446
Are you having some car trouble?

360
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,156
Picked a pretty shitty place for it.

361
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,421
These streets can be dangerous.

362
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,429
Hey.

363
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,803
I didn't mean to just show up like this.
I tried calling...

364
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,308
...I kept getting your voice-mail.
Yeah.

365
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,107
The service in here is pretty much shit.

366
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,849
Scotch.

367
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,050
Soda POP-

368
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,191
Am I interrupting something?
You're fidgety.

369
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,899
No. I'm just a little preoccupied
with the case.

370
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,667
You look terrible.
When's the last time you slept?

371
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,966
I'm fine, Alex.

372
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,302
You should get a real drink.
It's obvious you need one.

373
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,513
Why would you say that to me?

374
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,913
You're not in AA.
You don'! have a problem.

375
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,486
You need to give up
this obsession with control.

376
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,247
I need to stay sharp.

377
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,420
Well, you might need one in a minute.

378
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,159
Why?

379
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,928
What is this?

380
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,072
I don't expect you
to sign them right away.

381
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,508
I know you're gonna
wanna look them over.

382
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,534
No.

383
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,774
Alex, not now.
John, we have to.

384
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,711
For each other,
for our daughter.

385
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:04,115
I think this is why Scarlett is telling these
wild stories, because we haven't moved on.

386
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,523
No, I don't want a divorce.

387
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,125
I don't want a divorce, I never did.
I love you.

388
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,522
I love you too.

389
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,593
But it's not enough,
not anymore.

390
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,892
It's been rough with me out of the house--
It hasn't been rough.

391
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,365
It hasn't been rough at all.
It's been great.

392
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,929
I didn't think that I could do it,
but I can.

393
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,865
I don't think
you should come back.

394
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,977
It will just make things harder for everyone,
in the end, this is what we need to do.

395
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,544
Please.

396
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,739
Please, please,
don't tear this family apart.

397
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:37,614
I'm not the one tearing our family apart.
Someone else did that when they stole our son.

398
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,425
John.

399
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,119
John.

400
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,232
Stay. Stay.

401
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,002
Somethings wrong with me.

402
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,234
I think I'm going crazy.

403
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,469
I feel like I've been seeing things.

404
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,942
Let's get you back to your room, okay?

405
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,647
I'm so sorry.

406
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,588
That's clumsy of me.

407
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,687
You never need to apologize for pouring
a glass of Chateau Margaux.

408
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,091
I was afraid you'd think
this was too much.

409
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,496
Oh, you mean the dress?
The night out on the town?

410
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,294
This nightcap?

411
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,699
You know I'm gay.
I'm not stupid.

412
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,704
We're destined for something much more...

413
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,139
...intimate.

414
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,278
What if I {Old you...

415
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,686
...Will Drake had to die?

416
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,900
Then you know the truth.

417
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,404
The well is dry.

418
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:09,738
Just yesterday, I drew a pair
of Bermudas in cannabis print.

419
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,506
So much for the West Coast influence.

420
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,153
I happen to think you're a genius.

421
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,421
But you've been comfortable
for far too long.

422
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,753
You need to burn...

423
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,259
...so you can rise from the ashes.

424
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,896
Kill Will.

425
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,507
You're giving me dangerous thoughts.

426
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,370
All great ideas are deadly.

427
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,676
I feel the same way with you
right now as I did...

428
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,872
...when I kissed my first man.

429
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,253
How many times
have you been with a woman'?

430
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,084
A few.
But they all ended...

431
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,950
...unfulfilled.

432
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,219
No danger in that tonight.

433
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,899
What is this shit?

434
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,800
Where did you get the balls
to eat out of my dish, man?

435
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,571
I'll call you later.

436
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,213
By the way...

437
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,076
...you're hard.

438
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,989
<i>Mom swam</i>

439
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,565
So that's it?

440
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,004
It's just over between us?

441
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,068
Don't be such a child.
What am I supposed to think?

442
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,177
I don't even get it. All he has is money.

443
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,472
Then you do get it.

444
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,080
What? You're rich.

445
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,946
I used to be.

446
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,159
<i>And then I met Bernie.</i>

447
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:07,587
<i>Madoff was very good at
separating people from their money...</i>

448
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,165
<i>"because he'd make you beg
to give it to him.</i>

449
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:15,362
<i>All my rich friends got richer,
20 percent return even; year,.</i>

450
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,770
<i>But he wouldn't take mine,
not until he could get it all.</i>

451
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,379
<i>The stocks, the bonds, the hotel.</i>

452
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,880
Bernie went to prison...

453
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,778
...and I lost everything.

454
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,480
So that's why you didn't want me
to kill Drake?

455
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:38,328
Will Drake can't die until after...

456
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,622
...I marry him...

457
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,629
...and take every goddamn penny.

458
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,182
Jesus Christ.

459
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,650
It's no wonder you're in such a state,
sleeping five feet away from all this.

460
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,819
I don't do much
sleeping anymore.

461
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,894
Which is why you're gonna take these.
Drink them down.

462
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,764
You don't have a fever.

463
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,525
You just need some rest.

464
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,431
A few hour's sleep,
and everything will be clearer.

465
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,071
Okay?

466
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,687
I'm so sorry, Alex.

467
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,117
I'm sorry I couldn't keep
our family together.

468
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,089
I'm sorry...

469
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,689
...that I couldn't bring
your boy back home to you.

470
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,793
I know.

471
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,638
It's not your fault.

472
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,741
I know how much you loved him.

473
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,140
More than me.

474
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,210
More than Scarlett.

475
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,405
John.
It's okay.

476
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,572
I never minded.

477
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,243
That's how I love you.

478
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,569
Let's have another baby.

479
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,003
Oh, Jesus.

480
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,414
What am I doing?

481
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,777
We still love each other.

482
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,445
The divorce papers are here.

483
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,249
If you have any questions,
just call the lawyer.

484
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,856
Is this hell?

485
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:33,701
No. If this were hell, I'd be the one in that
awful Zara knockoff that you're wearing.

486
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,169
Holden?

487
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,545
Hi, Mommy.

488
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,099
Oh, God. Get the lead out,
will you?

489
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,041
I'm terrified of needles.
I just want this over with.

490
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,206
First, you need to tell me
why I should be doing you this kindness...

491
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,076
...when I could just push you
right out that window.

492
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,882
Even things up.
Oh, come on.

493
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,648
You're not gonna torment me now.

494
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:05,158
I think it would be good for you
to talk about why you wanna die.

495
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:09,327
Entertain me with your self-loathing.

496
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,329
It's not about why die.

497
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,234
It's about...

498
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,237
...why continue to live.

499
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,243
I can't think of a single reason.

500
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,283
I guess
I'm just not lovable.

501
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,679
Now,
what's to say?

502
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:33,021
My own son hates me.

503
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,524
He always has.

504
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,325
You know, I see people
laughing and smiling.

505
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,096
And I cannot for the life of me...

506
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,826
...understand why.

507
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,532
I just don't get the joke anymore.

508
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,438
I am the joke.

509
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,216
Hang on.

510
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:15,455
We are going total bye-bye, right?

511
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:19,664
You swear you don't have
any unfinished business here?

512
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,470
Because I am stuck in this place,
thanks to you.

513
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:26,302
So I wanna be 100 percent sure
that when I do this, I am done...

514
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,469
...with your miserable old ass.

515
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,847
In other words...

516
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,986
...don't haunt my hallways, bitch.

517
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,853
I want nothing more...

518
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,992
...than the dark silence of death itself.

519
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,327
You've come to the right girl.

520
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:17,725
How many junkies did you feed on,
Donovan'! Heh, heh.

521
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,197
You're no good to anyone in this condition.

522
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:27,427
So I'm gonna clean you up,
get that poison out of your blood.

523
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:32,200
And then we'll see
if you can be of any use to me.

524
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,040
Who the hell are you?

525
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,109
Now, that's the wrong question.

526
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,544
What you should be asking is...

527
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,873
...who was I?

528
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,884
Somebody order room service?

529
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,150
<i>I was the queen of them all.</i>

530
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,956
No. We ordered hookers.

531
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,498
Get on your knees.

532
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:18,578
- I don't get on my knees for no man.
- Cut.

533
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,518
Check the gate.
Ooh.

534
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,750
That looked good.
Ha-ha-ha.

535
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:30,258
<i>I had come to Hollywood with barely</i>
a <i>high school education and no prospects.</i>

536
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:34,460
<i>It wasn't long before I was a star.</i>

537
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:40,374
<i>My pictures grossed 10, 15 times
what they cost to produce.</i>

538
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,772
<i>Somebody was making money.</i>

539
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,675
<i>It just wasn't me.</i>

540
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,045
<i>They call what we did</i> B <i>movies.</i>

541
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,018
<i>I wanted more.</i>

542
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,348
A chance, Mr. Samuels.

543
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,491
That's all I'm asking.

544
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,992
Before you cast Jane Fonda,
just let me read.

545
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:03,394
The role of Sally Hyde is gonna require--
A white woman.

546
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,124
A serious actress.

547
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,997
I'm very serious.

548
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,869
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

549
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,172
I've taken a room at the hotel.
Why don't you come up for a drink...

550
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,871
...and we can talk more about it.

551
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,675
Ramona Royale.

552
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,319
What an honor.

553
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,512
I've seen all your pictures.

554
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,859
You should go.

555
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,589
Now.

556
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,998
What did you just do?

557
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,773
Saved you from making
a humiliating mistake.

558
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:51,541
<i>All she'd done was look at
that producer and he'd turn tail and run.</i>

559
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,207
<i>Now she was tasking at me.</i>

560
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,710
<i>But I didn't feel like running.</i>

561
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:01,555
<i>She was this rarified, timeless creature.</i>

562
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:06,957
<i>She knew everything
about art, literature, fashion.</i>

563
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,621
<i>This was the world I wanted to live in.</i>

564
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:14,031
<i>And she promised I could, forever.</i>

565
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,793
<i>It was glorious.</i>

566
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,400
<i>She taught me I could be a lady
and badass.</i>

567
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,770
<i>There was nothing I couldn't be...</i>

568
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:02,684
<i>...except hers forever.</i>

569
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,595
<i>Prophet Moses was in the vanguard
of those early, heady days.</i>

570
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,664
<i>Back when Tupac and Biggie
were making some noise.</i>

571
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:19,097
<i>But he hadn't broken through yet...</i>

572
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:24,104
<i>...which is why the record company put him up
at the Cortez and not the Four Seasons.</i>

573
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,764
<i>Mo was a poet.</i>

574
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,775
<i>And he was, without exception."...</i>

575
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:34,474
<i>the most beautiful man I had ever seen.</i>

576
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,984
<i>I always thought she was
the great love of my rife.</i>

577
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:39,855
<i>I was wrong,.</i>

578
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,048
<i>It was Mo.</i>

579
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:53,463
<i>And I aimed to be with him forever.</i>

580
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,484
You ready, baby?

581
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,917
I'm ready.

582
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,878
It's sad.

583
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,189
He could have had a future.

584
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:52,952
Who the hell are you?
Mo, Mo. Don't. Don't.

585
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,958
She must have really loved you.

586
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:07,938
<i>What she couldn't have was one
of her creations creating something else.</i>

587
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,943
<i>There can only be one queen,.</i>

588
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:18,919
She took away from me the only thing
that I ever really cared about.

589
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,721
And I plan to do
the same thing to her.

590
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:26,919
You think by killing me,
you'll get your revenge?

591
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,722
Not you, fool.

592
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,328
Those babies she made.

593
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:37,435
But I need access.

594
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:41,008
Someone on the inside.

595
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,406
And that someone...

596
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,911
...is gonna be you.

597
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,948
She dumped me last Tuesday.

598
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,755
You can go.

599
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:41,197
I thought you'd left us for good.

600
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:49,005
It's a pretty humbling feeling
when you realize you have nowhere to go.

601
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,807
And what's out there for me?
I've got no money.

602
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,678
No friends I can crash with.

603
00:47:56,474 --> 00:48:00,012
Pretty hard to explain away
a 20-year gap in my résumé.

604
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,748
And I've got a floppy appendage
between my legs...

605
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,655
...which keeps me
from wearing pencil skirts.

606
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,422
We all have our flaws, kitten.

607
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,831
I thought you were an actor.

608
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:20,499
You don't have to have a resume
to be beautiful or talent to be an actor.

609
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,770
Just ask Laurence Harvey.
I'm not an actor.

610
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,574
Four years of auditioning,
and I booked one...

611
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,776
...under five on The Colbys.
Aw.

612
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,113
You need moonshine.

613
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:36,088
I did get to work with Charlton Heston, though.
Not everyone can say that.

614
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,260
I don't even have a room at this hotel.
I have got nothing.

615
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,920
No one.

616
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:45,590
For eternity.
No pity party in my bar.

617
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,897
Especially when the guest of honor...

618
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:52,768
...can't see that he's the luckiest man
who ever checked into the Hotel Cortez.

619
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,036
You think you've tasted humility
out there on the streets...

620
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,043
...you ain't tasted shit,
young man.

621
00:48:58,202 --> 00:48:59,647
I know...

622
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,249
...because I have.

623
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:07,219
You should be ashamed of yourself
for abusing your mother.

624
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:11,485
I abused her?
I do not den}; that that woman is horrible.

625
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:15,222
Horrible. But in the next hundred years
of living...

626
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:19,663
...you may find someone who treats you
better, who screws you better...

627
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:22,395
...who makes you laugh more than cry.

628
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:27,565
You'll never find anyone who loves you
as much as she does.

629
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,623
I'm not dead.

630
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:47,626
<i>Jesus.</i>

631
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:52,359
You're unbelievable. I gave you enough
to kill an entire marching band.

632
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,799
Plan B.

633
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,941
Jesus, Iris.

634
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:27,034
Shouldn't be long now.

635
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,197
Hey, Ma?

636
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,566
Ma.

637
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,738
Shit.

638
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,902
Ma, it's Dono.

639
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:14,508
Ma!

640
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,516
She's resting.

641
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,950
Come back later.
I need to talk with her.

642
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,088
You leave her alone.

643
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:24,118
She's finally at peace.
No.

644
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,919
Ma, no, no. What did you do?

645
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,030
I didn't do anything.
Nothing she didn't ask me to do.

646
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,358
No, no.

647
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,292
No.

648
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,062
She can't be dead.

649
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:36,865
She's all I've got.

650
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,529
Oh, come on,
man.

651
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:41,040
You told her you wanted her dead.

652
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,078
You bitch.

653
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,073
What are you doing?

654
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,413
No, don't do that.
Unh!

655
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,490
Come back, Ma.

656
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,628
Come back to me, Mommy.

657
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,927
Come back to me.

658
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:07,926
There you go.

659
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,439
Yeah. Yeah.

660
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:15,574
Now, there's some twisted poetic justice.
