     <i> We had ambitions to be</i>

Welcome to

  Please, sign our guest book.

14
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,307
             Sure.

15
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,476
   May I offer the two of you
     a glass of champagne?

16
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:52,877
                          Ooh.
Don't mind if I do.

17
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,846
Ah.

         those are the reviewers

00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,518
        from that Internet site,
               Trip Adventurers.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,954
        They must've heard about
            our grand reopening.

21
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:04,522
I know.

22
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:06,958
Can't you see
the ridiculously gracious smile

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,926
plastered on my face?

24
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:14,298
   What is that pungent odor?

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,368
  Sage. To cleanse the spirit.

26
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:19,704
                   I'll show you
                   to your room.

Minibar?

    Mixers are on the house.

    anything else you need,

40
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:54,405
just pick up
the phone.

41
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:55,940
           Thank you.

42
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:57,575
        Enjoy your stay.

43
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,212
And you were ready
to give it a pass.

44
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:03,681
            Kill me.

        Are you kidding?

48
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:10,621
  That's a Toto Neorest 700H,
             baby.

49
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:12,390
      The Japanese self-cleaning

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,026
                        (laughs)

52
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,595
            I have always wanted
            to try one of these.

00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:21,065
     SALLY: Doesn't it just make
        you want to take a dump?

54
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,400
Who the hell are you?

55
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:23,901
How did you get in here?

56
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:26,304
                   (Sally sighs)

57
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:29,974
                   I got to say,
               it's a nice room.

58
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:34,645
They spent every penny they had
to change everything they could.

59
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,080
 They took out the mattresses,

60
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:38,382
      especially the ones
         I split open.

61
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:40,451
     Took out the carpets,

62
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:44,288
soaked through
with so many years

63
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,791
       of piss and blood.

64
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:50,962
They even changed the furniture.

65
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,898
          But you know
  what they couldn't take out?

66
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:58,503
           The pain.

67
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,005
     'Cause I'm still here.

68
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:02,840
      All right, I'm gonna
   have to ask you to leave.

69
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,075
                            Now.
        Hey.

70
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:05,510
            Oh! God!

71
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,845
           (gasping)

72
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:10,348
               Oh, God! Oh, God!

73
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:13,584
        Call the police!

74
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,621
        Some crazy bitch
    just killed my partner!

75
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:17,655
         Please... ah!

76
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:19,457
        Oh, my God. Oh!

77
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,825
            Oh, God.

78
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,793
  Please, you got to help me!

79
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,496
No, no.
You have to help me.

80
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,131
I'm new at this murder game,

81
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,667
and, Jesus Christ,
is it a thrill.

82
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,845
           Ah, crap.

83
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:43,948
         We got another one down
      at the end of the hallway.

84
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,283
            Damn it.

85
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,018
     This has got to stop.

86
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,719
He stained
the new carpet.

87
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,688
Yeah, we got a serious problem.

88
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,557
        The ghosts keep
      killing the guests,

89
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,926
       we're gonna end up
        with zero stars.

90
00:03:56,896 --> 00:04:00,198
        It's time we had
       a goddamn meeting.

91
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,267
              ¶ ¶

92
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:15,106
               Hello!

93
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,741
              Welcome!

94
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:19,410
   Thank you all for coming.
                          MARCY:
                      Excuse me.

95
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:21,746
        My understanding is that
      you two are in charge now,

96
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:24,282
    and I'd like to speak to you
         about changing my room.

97
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:26,450
LIZ:
Sweetheart, you're a ghost.

98
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:29,053
         You can choose
   whatever room you'd like.

99
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,888
MARCY: Well, yes,
but the problem is,

100
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,323
after I pick a room

101
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,992
       and then settle in
    with my erotica novels,

102
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:36,994
         I never know if a guest
            is going to check in

103
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,629
                 and disturb me.

104
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,564
                  I know this is
                    Los Angeles,

105
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:43,000
   but I'm an old-fashioned girl
          and I like my privacy.

106
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:45,002
          STEPHEN: I dig it when
             the guests come in.

107
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:46,504
 It's like a free dirty movie.

108
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:47,772
  I'm into that amateur stuff.

109
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:49,240
(chuckles)

110
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,508
      Are you three, like,
          a thing now?

111
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,575
VENDELA:
Ya.

112
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,577
We try dating
the lumberjack,

113
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,780
but he's a gay.

114
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,248
           IRIS: Okay, everyone,
                 please, listen.

115
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,516
       This is important,

116
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,985
            and it affects every
              single one of you.

117
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:04,121
       We would like you
  to stop killing the guests.

118
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:05,356
                        (laughs)
          (murmuring)

119
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:06,490
LIZ:
It's not all of you,

120
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,159
       but we are trying

121
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,593
to build something special here.

122
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:12,430
     A real... destination.

123
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:15,299
  Look, they're gonna get two
 football teams down in Carson.

124
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,268
               That's 20 minutes
                   down the 110.

125
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,936
                This place could
                      be filled.

126
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:20,604
But if it gets out
that people are

127
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:22,273
                 checking in and
                   disappearing,

128
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:25,142
then obviously,
that's bad for business.

129
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,344
Screw you, Iris.

130
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,979
You're the biggest
killer in this room,

131
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:30,681
      you bloodsucker.
                           IRIS:
              Maybe in the past.

132
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:35,286
         But every drop of blood
         I drink now is donated.

133
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:37,121
Any murders that
go on in this hotel

134
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,522
are done by your kind.

135
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:41,125
       Excuse me, but...

136
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,027
what do you mean by "our kind"?

137
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,695
SALLY:
Can we all just call

138
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,865
    a spade a spade and say
you're talking about Will and I?

139
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:50,835
         I mean, Woo is

140
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:52,636
               too busy munching
                 on Swedish fish

141
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,372
               to bother anyone.

142
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:55,740
     Marcy molests herself

143
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:57,208
or complains all day.

144
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,876
The lumberjack
just mopes.

145
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,212
         And that hipster couple
               just trips around

146
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,147
         moaning about for kale.

147
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,916
                  Will and I are
                   the only ones

148
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,086
          who still get off on a
    little bit of true mischief.

149
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,354
                   And we're not
                       stopping.

150
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,323
Ending some jerk-off

151
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:14,558
who wastes the air
that he breathes?

152
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,994
That is the real high.

153
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:19,897
              I'm dead, but I've
          never felt more alive.

154
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,165
        Ha.

155
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,466
                 (slow clapping)

156
00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:26,036
               Beautifully said.

157
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:27,772
                  And I couldn't
                     agree more.

158
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:30,274
But I must come down
on the side of Cleopatra

159
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,343
 and her friend on this issue.

160
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:33,677
                          SALLY:
                    Oh, come on!

161
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,713
       You telling people
        to stop killing

162
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,783
is like Colonel Sanders telling
   us to stop eating chicken.

163
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,451
I'm not familiar
with your military friend

164
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:42,453
and his fondness
for poultry,

165
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:43,954
but my killing days
are over.

166
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:45,256
I thought
the Ten Commandment killings

167
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,690
were the beginning
of my work,

168
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,626
but it turns out
that they are the epilogue.

169
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:52,863
      The torch has been passed,
            and I feel complete.

170
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,468
    But this is a practical
decision, not an emotional one.

171
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,137
       This is our home.

172
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,440
            Frankly,
  it's the only one we've got.

173
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,375
None of us know
what is waiting for us

174
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:06,644
beyond this place
if it no longer stands.

175
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:09,447
Perhaps, without these walls
to protect us, we would all be

176
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,048
forced to move on and face

177
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,584
   the judgment of our Maker.

178
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,553
 If we can't stay in business,
       all bets are off.

179
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,620
      We'll have to sell.

180
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,955
Or get evicted.

181
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,223
                           WILL:
                That's bullshit.

182
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:20,791
                     I paid cash
                 for this place.

183
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,893
      My lawyers will keep
paying the upkeep and the taxes

184
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:24,762
          for as long
    as they have the funds.

185
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:27,131
Yeah, well, that's not gonna
take very long, cowboy.

186
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,233
             Sure, your business
             was worth a fortune

187
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,634
            when you were alive.

188
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,470
  But you're such a narcissist

189
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:35,506
 that you never brought anyone
 else in to design your lines.

190
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:38,476
       And when you disappeared,
                 they had zilch.

191
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,945
Now the whole shithouse
has gone up in flames.

192
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:43,013
  Your stock is worth pennies.

193
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,281
       That is bullshit!

194
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:45,516
     You're a goddamn liar.

195
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,184
            Enough!
    This is not a democracy!

196
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:48,452
           We are not
     in the House of Lords!

197
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,020
     We are a ship at sea!

198
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:52,656
       And when it comes
 to you spirits, I am captain!

199
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,959
           So listen up, mateys!

200
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,961
     There are six criteria

201
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:59,163
    that the U.S. Department
 of Interior uses to determine

202
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,998
      if a place is worthy
        of being called

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,833
         an historical landmark.

204
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,869
   This hotel fits them all.

205
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:08,172
       The one thing it does not
            yet possess is time.

206
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,841
Age.

207
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,710
        August 23, 2026.

208
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:15,346
  That will make it 100 years
   that this hotel has stood.

209
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,147
 And on that day, it will earn
    its rightful distinction

210
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,850
   as an historical landmark.

211
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,685
              They won't be able
                 to tear it down

212
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,187
                    even if they
                      wanted to.

213
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:26,824
     The killing must stop!

214
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,026
                          SALLY:
                    Oh, hell no.

215
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:31,295
    Some of us can't go out
         into the world

216
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:32,796
                         to find
                  companionship,

217
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,698
     so I'm not gonna stop
        collecting souls

218
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,400
   until I find my soul mate.
                          MARCH:
             Sally, I don't want

219
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,335
     to get rough with you,
    but you and I both know

220
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,904
           there is a way to get
          you to do as I please.

221
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:43,007
      Or do you not recall
the last time you disobeyed me?

222
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,808
      (muffled screaming,
        drill whirring)

223
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,913
    So, it's settled, then.

224
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:56,420
    The point of being dead
  is that there are no rules.

225
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,389
    It's the only salvation.

226
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:00,658
        Who gives a shit if they
            tear this place down

227
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,760
                 and send us all
               straight to hell?

228
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:05,329
It can't be any worse!

229
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,397
(spits)

230
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,909
       (knocking on door)

231
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,511
            Go away!

232
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,682
      Complimentary bottle
          of champagne

233
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:27,685
for our VIP long-term residents.

234
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,053
       That's you, missy.

235
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,388
       Save your breath.

236
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,290
   I know what you're up to.

237
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,793
     Your Kumbaya intrigues
  might work with the others;

238
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:37,428
they're not gonna work with me.

239
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,429
                           Good.

240
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,431
      We can cut the crap.

241
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,900
       Jesus, you're one
    lonely, miserable bitch.

242
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:46,270
Oh, there she is.

243
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,439
Now get the hell
out of my room.

244
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,208
        Don't you ever get tired
     of being so goddamn bitter?

245
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,310
   I want to help you, Sally.

246
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,946
   This coming from the woman
 who shoved me out of a window.

247
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:56,947
                           Okay.

248
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,750
         That's on me.

249
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:02,152
           I'm sorry.

250
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:03,988
             Truly.

251
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,057
     But it's no good for either
     of us to dwell in the past.

252
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,828
Honey, you haven't been the same
        since John left.

253
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,398
        Watch it, Iris.

254
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,868
I can still take an ice pick
to your throat, anytime.

255
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,513
         You loved him.

256
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:32,650
                    The only way
                   you knew how.

257
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,185
                   He turned his
                    back on you,

258
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:38,589
                 after all you'd
                   done for him.

259
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:42,092
     I know how that feels.

260
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:45,295
  You don't know a damn thing
       about how I feel.

261
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:47,665
                  About my pain.

262
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:52,536
The only thing
that takes the edge off

263
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:56,306
         is when I can
   pull people under with me.

264
00:11:56,308 --> 00:12:00,511
         Make them feel
   one ounce of what I feel.

265
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:03,213
      Then I'm not alone.

266
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:05,516
              But don't you see?

267
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:09,219
         All those people you've
           been killing, it's...

268
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,355
         they're just Band-Aids.

269
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:15,526
             What if I knew of a
             more permanent fix?

270
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:18,128
                  You could have
         something long-lasting.

271
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,131
                       A future.

272
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,634
          What future?

273
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,235
           I'm dead.

274
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:27,871
              You've been living
                in a 1994 world.

275
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,673
             Times have changed.

276
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:34,578
    The Cortez is proud to offer
   free Wi-Fi now in every room.

277
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:42,052
              Here's your ticket
                   to adventure.

278
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,591
                 Go on, open it.

279
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,763
What am I supposed
to do with this?

280
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,531
                 We can't change
                       the past,

281
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,600
           but you can choose to
          move forward and live.

282
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,102
So what?

283
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:00,104
         I-I'm gonna be
   the ghost in the machine?

284
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:03,073
         That's exactly
     what you're gonna be.

285
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,075
          Okay, look.

286
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:08,011
     I loaded it up for you

287
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,749
    with Twitter, Instagram,

288
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,016
                   Facebook. You
                don't need to be

289
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,085
                out in the world
             to be a part of it.

290
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,222
       In the modern age, no one
           ever has to be alone.

291
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,190
              Even for a second.

292
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:24,428
 There's a whole world out there
  waiting to embrace you, Sally.

293
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,498
           Come on, all you have
               to do is dive in.

294
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:31,635

298
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:43,213

 <i> In droves, tingling for more.</i>

303
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,959
        <i> A rapt audience</i>
 <i> welcoming her with open arms,</i>

304
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,729
     <i> desperate to connect,</i>
  <i> hanging onto her every word.</i>

305
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>Suddenly the girl no one wanted</i>
 <i> became the belle of the ball.</i>

306
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:05,502
    <i> She could say anything,</i>
         <i> bare her soul.</i>

307
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,939
  <i> Her lone voice weaving into</i>
   <i> its own cyber subculture.</i>

314
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,742
Another?

315
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:51,615
                   How long have
                    I been dead?

316
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:53,617
It's over a year now.

317
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:55,552
How long
does it feel like?

318
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:59,323
Like I don't exist.

319
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:04,561
Is that why you've been acting
out and killing those people?

320
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:07,130
         I had no idea
   that my business was dead.

321
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:08,899
                      (chuckles)

322
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,535
              Oh, it's not dead.
                     It's dying.

323
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,904
        Well, what have
       they done with it?

324
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:15,205
           Factories?

325
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,742
            The stores on Rodeo,
                   Fifth Avenue?

326
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:21,478
Well, they shuttered
the couture division.

327
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,415
The perfumes and sunglasses are
keeping everything else afloat.

328
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,751
And you do matter
in the world, you know.

329
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:32,823
    As long as it lives and
 your son thrives, you matter.

330
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:37,227
        I'm grateful for
   what you've done for him.

331
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,997
  Thatcher is one of the best
    schools in the country,

332
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:43,100
 and Ojai is year-round divine.

333
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:44,735
              You should let him
             come and visit you.

334
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,703
      No. No.

335
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:53,377
                This is no place
                for a young man.

336
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,378
(chuckles)

337
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,114
          All of the death here.

338
00:15:57,116 --> 00:16:00,918
             I don't want him to
              be poisoned by it.

339
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,987
      Even if it breaks my heart
           that I can't see him.

340
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,792
May I make a proposition?

341
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:10,961
           You're beautiful, but
             you're not my type.

342
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:12,996
(laughs)

343
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,034
The trapped spirits
in this place

344
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:20,771
who aren't in perpetual misery
understand that

345
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:23,774
if you want to feel the magic
of cause and effect,

346
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:25,475
you have to have a purpose.

347
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:28,612
Your fashion house was iconic.

348
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,580
You're iconic.

349
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,282
            My fashion house was
             headed for disaster

350
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:35,218
                   long before I
                  "disappeared."

351
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,621
         I haven't had
an original thought in a decade.

352
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,056
This is California!

353
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:42,392
                     The land of
                    reinvention.

354
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:43,794
                         I mean,

355
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:46,229
look what this place
did for me.

356
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,167
      Where does everyone
        even think I am?

357
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,601
Rumors abound.

358
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:55,605
Rehab, madness, illness.

359
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:58,075
        Each one more scandalous
                  than the last.

360
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:01,678
            Frankly,
   it's marvelous publicity.

361
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,747
          People love a mystery.

362
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,752
                         Sketch.

363
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:10,520
                         Create.

364
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:12,556
  Be part of the world again.

365
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:17,461
    Running a fashion house
    is more than sketching.

366
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:21,064
 More than any other business,
      a line needs a face.

367
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:30,440
                     (chuckles):
                           Okay.

368
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:34,611
        I was a salesman
        in another life.

369
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:36,713
          In this one,
    I'm the mother of style.

370
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,615
    Cut me and I bleed Dior.

371
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:45,122
And you don't have
to be dead, you know.

372
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:47,557
   So you decided to hole up
      in your happy place,

373
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,626
       like Howard Hughes
       without the crazy.

00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:51,461

                            LIZ:
                             Oh.

435
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,380
         (door closes)

436
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,218
Billie Dean Howard,
this is Liz.

437
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,753
Liz, it is so good to meet you.

438
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:06,256
        (chuckles) I've seen you
           on the side of a bus.

439
00:21:06,258 --> 00:21:07,691
(chuckles)

440
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,392
        Billie Dean has
   her own show on Lifetime.

441
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,428
          She helps the bereaved
                communicate with

442
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,396
           their dearly departed
                     loved ones.

443
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,664
         I'm impressed.

444
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,032
        I'll be honest.

445
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:17,734
       Your establishment
      is fairly notorious

446
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:21,104
among the paranormal communities
   being a bit of a hot spot.

447
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:22,339
           (chuckles)

448
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:23,506
  I was thinking I might want

449
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,175
        to do an episode
        of my show here.

450
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:26,910
                (chuckles)
But today,

451
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,145
       I am here for you.

452
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:46,296
                            Hmm.

453
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:52,569
            Hmm, so many voices.

454
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,638
        It's a very noisy hotel.

455
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,349
    (faint, echoing chatter)

456
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,990
Oh, I feel something.

457
00:22:13,992 --> 00:22:16,893
A very masculine energy.

458
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:18,962
Restless.

459
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,999
           He's here.

460
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,437
Spirit,

461
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:31,574
 we seek you with loving hearts
        and open minds.

462
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:36,246
Lift the veil that separates
our world from yours.

463
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:38,081
          Speak to us.

464
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,519
            Tristan.

465
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:43,687
Hello.

466
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,689
            (gasps)

467
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:48,992
Tristan,
I'm here with Liz.

468
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,727
   She misses you very much.

469
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,764
      Is there any message
       you have for her?

470
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,437
                           What?

471
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:02,072
               What does he say?

472
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,611
           He says...

473
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:10,280
             "No."

474
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:12,048
What do you mean, "No"?

475
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,216
         What-what no?

476
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:15,051
    He doesn't want to talk.

477
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:17,053
       What do you mean?
      He's talking to you.

478
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,855
                      He doesn't
                    want to talk

479
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,291
             to me.

480
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,226
                  He's been here
                      all along.

481
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:26,229
 And he's choosing not to talk
      to me... (sniffles)

482
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,997
      'cause he blames me.

483
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,166
  I'm the cause of his death.

484
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,235
  My love for him killed him.

485
00:23:32,237 --> 00:23:34,070
       Love doesn't kill.

486
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:40,710
  I've been around a lot longer,
  and let me tell you something.

487
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,713
          Believe me, love kills
           a lot more than hate.

488
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:48,885
  Thank you for coming anyway.

489
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:53,757
           Be strong.

490
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,893
I know you know how.

491
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:59,562
                 (whispers):
                     Yep.

492
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,898
     No. This isn't right.

493
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,868
No, wait.
             (sighs)

494
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,937
    Maybe it wasn't Tristan
      you were talking to.

495
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:13,176
   He remembers the pancakes.

496
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:18,348
You made them for him
every Saturday

497
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,250
and let him watch cartoons
all morning.

498
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:21,885
         Who's Donovan?

499
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:23,953
                           What?

500
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,690
             Donovan isn't here.

501
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:29,359
No, no, no.

502
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,194
Donovan is someplace else.

503
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:34,397
Someplace very beautiful.

504
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:37,634
He says it smells like pancakes.

505
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,571
         <i> Your</i> pancakes.

506
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:45,375
He says it's always
Saturday morning where he is.

507
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,845
He says...

508
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:53,249
       "I love you, Mom."

Are you sure?

533
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:00,517
                       I'm sure.

                         Well...

535
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,786
             the doctor is sure.

536
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:06,155
And there ain't nothing
they can do about it?

537
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:09,993
     It's... past the point
         of treatment.

538
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:13,029
Which is probably for the best.

539

00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,909
   there just might be something
          that I can do for you.

543
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:27,544
(scoffs)
                      Huh?

544
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:28,878
What, turn me?

545
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,980
Hell, I don't even
like my steak bloody.

00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:32,549
But that's never been
an option for me.

You know that.

And at this point
in my life,

549
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:40,657
    I can't imagine killing
       in order to live.

550
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:42,559
                So have you told
                  your kids yet?

551
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:46,496
         With any luck,
        I won't need to.

552
00:26:46,498 --> 00:26:48,831
They can just keep
visiting me here.

        it's spread to the spine

559
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,693
   and there's nothing to do.

560
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,933
We'll spend whatever we have to.

to the best doctor in the world.

              Oh, it's too late.

563
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,406
   And I don't want to spend

564
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:32,408
   my last days wasting away
         in a hospital

565

     and poison in my body,

566
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:36,713
                           so...

567
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:38,915
          But who will take care
                  of us?

568
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,050
   You can't leave us alone.
I won't.

569
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,219
  That's why I called you all
          here today.

570
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:47,991
    Now, I have provided you
     with various weapons.

571
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:50,593
    Take two. They're small.

572
00:27:50,595 --> 00:27:52,829
             Uh...

573
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:54,797
            hack me.

574
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,833
          Strangle me.

575
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:58,935
          Bludgeon me.

576

            that we've all grown
             rather fond of you.

579

murder you.

00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:30,600
      ¶ The morning sun ¶

586
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:35,938
      ¶ Touched lightly on
   the eyes of Lucy Jordan ¶

587
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,842
¶ In a white suburban bedroom ¶

588
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:43,713
  ¶ In a white suburban town ¶

589
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:47,717
      ¶ And she lay there
       neath the covers ¶

590
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:51,454
         ¶ Dreaming of
      a thousand lovers ¶

591
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:55,625
        ¶ Till the world
       turned to orange ¶

592
00:28:55,627 --> 00:29:01,631
      ¶ And the room went
        spinning round ¶

593
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:06,469
      ¶ At the age of 37 ¶

594
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:09,706
         ¶ She realized
       she'd never ride ¶

595
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,743
        ¶ Through Paris
       in a sports car ¶

596
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:15,378
      (door whooshes open)

597
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,882
      ¶ With the warm wind
         in her hair ¶

598
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,552
     ¶ So she let the phone
       keep ringing... ¶

599
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:26,489
   LIZ:<i> It was the first time</i>
  <i> I'd seen her since she died.</i>

600
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:29,225
      <i> Only in that moment</i>
         <i> did I realize</i>

601
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:32,328
 <i> just how much I'd missed her.</i>

602
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,897
   How did you know to come?

603
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:39,102
        You were always
      my fondest creation.

604
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:40,837
      ¶ He's off to work ¶

605
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:45,708
         ¶ And the kids
      are off to school ¶

606
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,011
        ¶ And there were
      oh so many ways... ¶

607
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,748
      I wanted to be here
    to help you transition.

608
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,549
  ¶ For her to spend her day ¶

609
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:58,020
  ¶ She could clean the house
          for hours ¶

610
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:01,190
  ¶ Or rearrange the flowers ¶

611
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:05,695
         ¶ Or run naked
 through the shady street... ¶

612
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:09,365
         One last time.

613
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:10,867
           (exhales)

614
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:13,302
      ¶ At the age of 37 ¶

615
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:16,706
         ¶ She realized
       she'd never ride ¶

616
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:19,609
       ¶ Through Paris ¶

617
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,444
     ¶ In a sports car... ¶

618
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:26,783
              ¶ ¶

619
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:56,078
            TRISTAN:
   Those things'll kill you.

620
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:08,024
I don't understand.

621
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,092
    You wouldn't talk to me.

622
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,297
    I thought you hated me.

623
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:16,365
          I love you.

624
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:22,638
         And, darlin',

625
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,974
   you had more living to do.

626
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:27,043
                  I couldn't get
             in the way of that.

627
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:31,280
            (laughs)

628
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,551
Oh, baby...

629
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:37,920
      you are to die for.

630
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:53,302
        May I help you?
     I have a reservation.

631
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:54,537
            Room 44.

632
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,138
         The Woo room.

633
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,707
        That's where Billie Dean
                   says he died.

634
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,909
    Oh, that room is booked.

635
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:01,544
 Booked by me, three weeks ago.

636
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,379
     Under Rhodes, Ashley.

637
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:05,748
          My Amex app
  says the charge has cleared.

638
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,584
       You have my money.
        I want my room.

639
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:11,420
             Fine.

640
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,760
It's all my fault.

641
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:19,896
I thought that Billie'd be
free advertising.

642
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:22,064
You know, people love
a good ghost story.

643
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,767
                  Well, you were
               right about that.

644
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,436
Yeah, but this is getting
way out of hand.

645
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:30,206
She's had
three prime-time specials.

646
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,508
    Wait, wait, wait, wait.

647
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,610
       Wait, he's trying
     to tell me something.

648
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,049
 Mr. Woo doesn't pay for what?

649
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:41,751
             IRIS:
  <i> I mean, don't get me wrong.</i>

650
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,420
I don't mind having this place
alive with guests.

651
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:46,722
It's just
those freaks and weirdos

652
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:48,624
who want to be
plowed by a ghost.

653
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:51,294
     The people Billie attracts,
                 they're just...

654
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:53,729
         It's bad for our brand.

655
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:56,232
               Why don't we just
            shut the place down?

656
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:58,467
         Will Drake doesn't need
              the money anymore.

657
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:00,770
'Cause this place needs life.

658
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,139
 It's a hotel, not a cemetery.

659
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:05,241
  The living give the spirits
     trapped in this place

660
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:07,143
          a connection
     to the outside world.

661
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:08,711
                           IRIS:
                           John.

662
00:33:08,713 --> 00:33:11,414
            I was wondering when
          you were gonna arrive.

663
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,982
       We've missed you.

664
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:15,885
It's good to be back.
And you're right.

665
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:17,920
I don't like her
coming around.

666
00:33:17,922 --> 00:33:19,889
Pestering,
asking questions.

667
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:21,657
                She still trying
                  to contact me?

668
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,060
    Every year on this date.

669
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:28,597
           John Lowe.

670
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,333
  The Ten Commandments Killer.

671
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:33,402
 Show yourself and bear witness
        to your crimes.

672
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:43,512
             Shit.

673
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:44,981
Call her.

674
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,482
Check her into my room.

675
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,950
But get her here quickly.

676
00:33:47,952 --> 00:33:49,885
It's only three hours
until sundown.

677
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:02,098
   We are standing in room 64
      of the Hotel Cortez,

678
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,834
      where the notorious
 Ten Commandments Killer lived

679
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:07,436
 when he terrorized Los Angeles
        many years ago.

680
00:34:07,438 --> 00:34:11,374
 John Lowe may be the most evil
      and dangerous spirit

681
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:14,477
with whom I have ever attempted
        to make contact.

682
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:18,881
  I will need all of my skills
  and powers of concentration

683
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:22,551
           to achieve
 this unprecedented interview.

684
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:27,923
         (sighs softly)

685
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,463
      (static hums softly)

686
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:37,133
             You wanted to talk?

687
00:34:40,238 --> 00:34:42,705
      I want you to talk.

688
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:45,975
My name is
Billie Dean Howard.

689
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:50,513
  All we know about John Lowe
 is what the police have said.

690
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:54,383
  I'm giving you a chance now
  to set the record straight.

691
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:59,055
(chuckles softly)

692
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,460
           (mouthing)

693
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:14,403
What do you
want to know?

694
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,208
       Why don't we start
       with your family.

695
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,776
         Did they know

696
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:22,912
                      you were a
                  serial killer?

697
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:25,014
     What'd you get Holden
          for dinner?
        It's dog again.

698
00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:26,782
             JOHN:
    <i> They came to understand</i>

699
00:35:26,784 --> 00:35:28,784
           that I was
     cleaning up the world,

700
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:31,387
         in my own way.
    ALEX:<i> Goddamn it, John.</i>

701
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:33,255
     We talked about this;
 I was not gonna target people

702
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,723
   who do not deserve to die.

703
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:36,525
 Now, once you went on the lam,

704
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:39,562
   your wife and two children
     were never seen again.

705
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:40,463
                           ALEX:
                        Come on.

706
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:41,964
Where are you going?
                    He's hungry.

707
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:43,132
    I know how to walk into
           a hospital

708
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,133
      and not get noticed.

709
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:46,035
       Did you kill them?

710
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:49,672
                   I will admit,
                  I failed them.

711
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:02,618
             Daddy?

712
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,555
                There's only one
               thing left to do.

713
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:09,058
Turn myself in?

714
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,127
             We have to go home.

715
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:18,400
             JOHN:
      <i> Scarlett was right.</i>

716
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:20,236
      <i> The Cortez was home.</i>

717
00:36:20,238 --> 00:36:23,606
  <i> We'd all been reborn there,</i>
    <i> in one form or another.</i>

718
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:25,808
     <i> Well, except for her.</i>

719
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,810
   <i> There was a still a chance</i>
        <i> for our daughter</i>

720
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,745
   <i> to grow up somewhere else,</i>

721
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:32,781
       <i> to have some shot</i>
       <i> at a normal life.</i>

722
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:35,851
      <i> But it needed to be</i>
         <i> away from us.</i>

723
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:37,820
    <i> Liz knew just the place.</i>

724
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,688
      <i> The Thatcher School</i>
         <i> would be host</i>

725
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,659
 <i> to more than one young refugee</i>
     <i> from the Hotel Cortez.</i>

726
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:46,795
            BILLIE:
<i>So you sent your daughter away,</i>

727
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:49,999
    <i> but lived with your son</i>
    <i> and wife in the Cortez,</i>

728
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:53,969
  <i> back in L.A., where you were</i>
      <i> still being hunted.</i>

729
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:57,373
   It's hard to provide for your
  family when you're on the run.

730
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:01,544
 There were more opportunities
        in Los Angeles.

731
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,354
            (grunts)

              ¶ ¶

733
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:40,516
       (tires screeching,
        sirens wailing)

734
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:44,153
       OFFICER: Stop! John Lowe,
            you're under arrest!

735
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:46,088
     I have to make it back
         to the hotel.

736
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,957
           (gunfire)

737
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,446
           (wheezing)

738
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:11,847
           Let me...

739
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:13,983
     I want to die inside.

740
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:22,191
           I'm sensing something
        about your wife and son.

741
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:26,762
    I can hear the undercurrents
               from the spirits,

742
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:29,064
         but they are too afraid
               to speak clearly.

743
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:30,933
                    Why is that?

744
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,636
      I don't want to talk
        about my family.

745
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:35,537
    Well, if you don't want
   to talk about your family,

746
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:36,939
  then give me something else.

747
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:41,877
What is the significance
of October 30?

748
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:45,681
Why is it the only day
I feel your presence here?

749
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,052
   Well, it's Devil's Night.

750
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:53,555
           And if you leave your
             camera crew behind,

751
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:55,624
      that I can show you.

752
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:01,463
              ¶ ¶

753
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:21,784
            BILLIE:
 <i> The walls. They're screaming.</i>

754
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:26,288
I was in a house once
just west of here.

755
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:31,293
And I could hear the spirits
in the walls like termites...

756
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:34,330
or bats in the attic.

757
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:37,433
But it was nothing like this.

758
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:41,870
This is like being
in a rock concert of the dead.

759
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,841
                  Well, come on.

760
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:48,777
    Let me introduce you to some
         rock stars of the dead.

761
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:50,379
      (jazz music playing)

762
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:52,381
          Oh, Jeffrey,
   you and your damn straws.

763
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:56,819
  Come on. Put your drink down
  and come and dance with me.

764
00:39:56,821 --> 00:39:58,887
                  I don't dance.

765
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:00,723
Look at me.

766
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:03,726
Neither do I.
(laughs)

767
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:06,562
           John! Oh!

768
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:09,565
       Jeffrey, look who's here.

769
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,166
                   John is here.

770
00:40:11,168 --> 00:40:13,569
               He's the greatest
                    of them all.

771
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:15,571
               Are you blushing?

772
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:19,174
  I told you, if you like a guy,
        you have to talk to him.

773
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:21,176
                You think any of
                 those young men

774
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:23,579
    would have come over to work
    at my house if I didn't have

775
00:40:23,581 --> 00:40:26,548
            the guts to approach
              them in the world?

776
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,250
(scoffs)

777
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:30,853
Well, those guys in Milwaukee
must have been pretty desperate

778
00:40:30,855 --> 00:40:32,521
to go home with Jeffrey.

779
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:35,190
     The guy can't get two words
        out without going flush.

780
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,492
                        (laughs)

781
00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:39,661
          Oh, my God.

782
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,730
    You're John Wayne Gacy.

783
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:47,002
   And that's Jeffrey Dahmer.

784
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:52,007
             Are you frightened?

785
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:54,676
Oh, no.

786
00:40:54,678 --> 00:41:00,015
No, I just surround myself with
the white light of spirit and...

787
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:03,051
to keep myself protected.

788
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:05,587
         Sure thing, sweetheart.

789
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,357
                 Yeah! Let's get
             this party started!

790
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:10,592
         I need a beer.
  I'll drink whatever's cold.

791
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:14,229
Jesus H. Christ on a horse, what
  the hell is this shit music?

792
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:15,764
   Aileen Wuornos.
       (record scratches)

793
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:17,466
        ("Fade Into You"
     by Mazzy Star playing)

794
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,368
                Richard Ramirez.

795
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,004
                I'm married, but
                  we live apart.

796
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:29,778
     And that's the Zodiac.

797
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,114
     I'll get you a drink.

798
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:40,289
   ¶ I want to hold the hand
        inside you... ¶

799
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,292
Uh, hey.

800
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:44,793
I'm Aileen.

801
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,563
 ¶ I want to take a breath... ¶

802
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:50,799
You have
the prettiest hair.

803
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:54,303
     Man, what I wouldn't do for
       a head of hair like that.

804
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:56,805
               It's like... it's
            like Farrah Fawcett.

805
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:59,675
             Reminds me of my-my
                  ex-girlfriend.

806
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:02,678
                        (laughs)
Oh, I feel ill.

807
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,646
All these dark spirits.

808
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,649
It's... (chuckles)
it's a little overwhelming.

809
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:10,652
                Just drink that.
                It'll relax you.

810
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:13,021
                          MARCH:
                       Absinthe!

811
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:15,891
    Our customary libation.

812
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:24,466
      James Patrick March.

813
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:26,935
              Oh.

814
00:42:26,937 --> 00:42:29,404
Oh, I feel the violence in you.

815
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:35,344
        So many spirits
      who you snuffed out.

816
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:41,717
I can see all the moments
when they crossed over.

817
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:44,186
                        Tell me,

818
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:45,988
       what is that like?

819
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,991
  Is it a moving picture, like
 so many cells on a film reel?

820
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:51,727
     Or more like a kaleidoscope
             of human suffering?

821
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:54,296
      It's not a picture.

822
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:57,499
        It's a feeling.

823
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:00,969
Like a mist on your face
on a cold morning.

824
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,708
You can't see it in the air,
but you can feel...

825
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,510
the wetness.

826
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:10,512
                Yeah. I can feel
                     the wetness

827
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:12,748
         with you so close to me
          right now, Johnny boy.

828
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,217
                 (both laughing)

829
00:43:22,993 --> 00:43:26,228
I got a seat
right next to me.

830
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,063
                       (panting)

831
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:29,965
(chuckles)

832
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,736
            (laughs)

833
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:40,108
   So this is Devil's Night.

834
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,177
       My Murderers' Row!

835
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:45,180
              How odd it must be
           to see all of us then

836
00:43:45,182 --> 00:43:47,349
                 in what appears
                to be the flesh.

837
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:49,885
      Flesh enough to eat,

838
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,753
drink,

839
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,523
feel our grip on your arm,

840
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:56,625
our breath on your skin.

841
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:59,227
            (shouts)
              No!

842
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:02,731
           (laughter)

843
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:05,133
     How's that white light
    holding up, Billie Dean?

844
00:44:05,135 --> 00:44:07,369
            BILLIE:
I don't want to be here anymore.

845
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:09,771
           When does
    the party favor arrive?

846
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,807
             MARCH:
   John's taken care of that.

847
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:13,241
       Grab your weapons,

848
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:14,776
ladies and gents.

849
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,079
              No.

850
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:17,846
     (chuckles)

851
00:44:19,383 --> 00:44:21,550
         No. (screams)

852
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:23,986
   Can't throw a killer party
without a little killing, right?

853
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:25,120
           (panting)

854
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:26,822
                           JOHN:
            Don't worry, Billie.

855
00:44:26,824 --> 00:44:29,157
   I think you're gonna like
          living here.

856
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,993
                Here's the deal.

857
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:33,495
 No more specials or interviews

858
00:44:33,497 --> 00:44:36,298
or books or tweets
or casual conversations

859
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,000
at cocktail parties
with Shirley MacLaine

860
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:39,501
               about this hotel.

861
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:41,503
   This place is dead to you.

862
00:44:41,505 --> 00:44:43,005
          We will become a myth,

863
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:45,807
which is what we should've been
       left to do anyway.

864
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,242
        What if I don't?

865
00:44:47,244 --> 00:44:48,977
AILEEN: One sure-as-shit thing
I can tell you

866
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:52,247
about being murdered: it hurts.

867
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:55,617
 And we like to make it last...

868
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,586
         (drill whirs)

869
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:01,523
        None of you can
     leave the hotel, so...

870
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:05,494
       you can't hold me
        to my word, huh?

871
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:07,562
            RAMONA:
           But I can.

872
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:12,534
BILLIE:
What the hell are you?

873
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:15,370
        You're not dead.

874
00:45:15,372 --> 00:45:16,872
                  I'm a creature

875
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:19,508
       who kills to live

876
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,144
 and who drinks a body's worth
         of blood a day

877
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:23,612
 and doesn't think twice about

878
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:26,448
                 who I'm sucking
                        it from.

879
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,151
    So, if you even let out
      a whisper of a word

880
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:30,886
                     that sounds
                  like "Cortez,"

881
00:45:30,888 --> 00:45:34,890
         I'll find you
  and drain every drop of life

882
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:37,559
     from your skinny ass.

883
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:39,394
RAMIREZ:
I can't be the only one here

884
00:45:39,396 --> 00:45:41,029
       hoping you say no.

885
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,631
    (drill whirs, laughter)
              No!

886
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:47,069
            No! No!

887
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:07,923
              ¶ ¶

888
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:24,506
      Did you take care of
 what you had to take care of?

889
00:46:24,508 --> 00:46:25,574
                           Yeah.

890
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:28,009
     Look at you, Scarlett.

891
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:29,745
                      Where'd my
                 little girl go?

892
00:46:29,747 --> 00:46:31,246
 You're just saying that 'cause

893
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:33,448
      I'm the only member
    of the family that ages.

894
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,050
           (chuckles)

895
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:37,452
              Thanks for coming.

896
00:46:37,454 --> 00:46:39,855
   Tonight means a lot to me.

897
00:46:39,857 --> 00:46:41,289
             For us

898
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:43,058
all to be together.

899
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,026
Even just for a few hours.

900
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:46,895
        Of course, Dad.

901
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:49,297
Means a lot to me, too.

902
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:51,867
       Go on.

903
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:54,870
Get into bed with them.

904
00:46:54,872 --> 00:46:56,705
            Not you?

905
00:46:56,707 --> 00:46:57,939
                     I'm getting
                    a little big

906
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,741
for the family bed.

907
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:01,810
      I'll take the chair.

908
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:14,422
                   I'm afraid to
                    fall asleep.

909
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:17,793
  As soon as I close my eyes,

910
00:47:17,795 --> 00:47:20,829
       it'll all be gone
       for another year.

911
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,331
       It's okay, Daddy.

912
00:47:25,002 --> 00:47:27,035
Rest.

913
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,377
              ¶ ¶

914
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:05,140
       (static crackles)

915
00:48:05,142 --> 00:48:07,209
      (jazz music playing)

916
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,101
              ¶ ¶

917
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:45,213
                 What brings you
                  to the Cortez?

918
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,215
Tomorrow's Halloween.

919
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,985
     This place is supposed
     to be haunted, right?

920
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:52,888
I'm meeting
some friends here.

921
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,656
        No, you're not.

922
00:48:55,692 --> 00:48:57,192
            I'm not?

923
00:48:57,194 --> 00:48:59,261
              No.

924
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:05,600
  You have a jawline for days.
