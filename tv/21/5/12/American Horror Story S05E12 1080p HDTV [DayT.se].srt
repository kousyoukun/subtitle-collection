1
00:00:01,341 --> 00:00:03,976
LIZ: We started
with such high hopes.

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:06,278
With all the previous owners
being dead,

3
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:10,115
the hotel was
under new management-- ours.

4
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:12,417
We were determined
to remake the Cortez

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,619
in our own image.

6
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,754
This would be no mere hotel.

7
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,590
We had ambitions to be
a family to the friendless,

8
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,759
a comfort to those in the cold,

9
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:25,096
a beehive of acceptance.

10
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:29,260
It was supposed to be
the perfect ending.

11
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,057
Oh, hello.
Hello.

12
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,159
Welcome to the Cortez.

13
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,293
Please, sign our guest book.

14
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,762
Sure.

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,930
May I offer the two of you
a glass of champagne?

16
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,331
- Ooh.
- Don't mind if I do.

17
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:52,267
Ah.

18
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,603
(whispering): I think
those are the reviewers

19
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,006
from that Internet site,
Trip Adventurers.

20
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,375
They must've heard about
our grand reopening.

21
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,943
I know.

22
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,379
Can't you see
the ridiculously gracious smile

23
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,314
plastered on my face?

24
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:11,719
What is that pungent odor?

25
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,755
Sage. To cleanse the spirit.

26
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,124
I'll show you to your room.

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,230
(elevator bell dings)

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,095
LIZ: To polish the jewel
that is the Cortez,

29
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,964
it required not only money--
which we got from liquidating

30
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,767
the Countess's
numerous pieces of art--

31
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:30,137
it was going to take
four stars on the Internet.

32
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,972
And so, we were off.

33
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:40,611
We haven't finished with
every floor, but this is one of

34
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:43,049
our newly refreshed rooms.

35
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,205
Egyptian cotton.

36
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,552
400 thread count.

37
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:46,482
Minibar?

38
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,432
Mixers are on the house.

39
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:50,357
If there's
anything else you need,

40
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,858
just pick up the phone.

41
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:52,904
Thank you.

42
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:54,542
Enjoy your stay.

43
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,062
And you were ready
to give it a pass.

44
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:01,100
Kill me.

45
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,335
(chuckles)

46
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,603
(gasps)

47
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:04,970
Are you kidding?

48
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,734
That's a Toto Neorest 700H,
baby.

49
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,808
The Japanese self-cleaning
wonder toilet.

50
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:11,091
(sighs):
Oh.

51
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,445
(laughs)

52
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,080
I have always wanted
to try one of these.

53
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,271
SALLY: Doesn't it just make
you want to take a dump?

54
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,818
Who the hell are you?

55
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,320
How did you get in here?

56
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,722
(Sally sighs)

57
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:27,359
I got to say, it's a nice room.

58
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:31,670
They spent every penny they had
to change everything they could.

59
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,083
They took out the mattresses,

60
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:35,834
especially the ones
I split open.

61
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,903
Took out the carpets,

62
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:41,740
soaked through
with so many years

63
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,209
of piss and blood.

64
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,113
They even changed the furniture.

65
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,016
But you know
what they couldn't take out?

66
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,653
The pain.

67
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:58,156
'Cause I'm still here.

68
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,924
All right, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

69
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,159
- Now.
- Hey.

70
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,560
Oh! God!

71
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,963
(gasping)

72
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,432
Oh, God! Oh, God!

73
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,702
Call the police!

74
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:13,738
Some crazy bitch
just killed my partner!

75
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:14,772
Please... ah!

76
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,574
Oh, my God. Oh!

77
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:17,942
Oh, God.

78
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,911
Please, you got to help me!

79
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:22,614
No, no.
You have to help me.

80
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,248
I'm new at this murder game,

81
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:26,751
and, Jesus Christ,
is it a thrill.

82
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,996
Ah, crap.

83
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,098
We got another one down
at the end of the hallway.

84
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,432
Damn it.

85
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,167
This has got to stop.

86
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,869
He stained the new carpet.

87
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,838
Yeah, we got a serious problem.

88
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,706
The ghosts keep
killing the guests,

89
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,042
we're gonna end up
with zero stars.

90
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:57,313
It's time we had
a goddamn meeting.

91
00:04:50,915 --> 00:05:01,067
<font color="#FF0000">Downloaded from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">DayT.se</font>

92
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:09,315
Hello! Welcome!

93
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:12,449
- Thank you all for coming.
MARCY: Excuse me.

94
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,817
My understanding is that
you two are in charge now,

95
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:17,353
and I'd like to speak to you
about changing my room.

96
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,522
LIZ:
Sweetheart, you're a ghost.

97
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:21,628
You can choose
whatever room you'd like.

98
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,490
MARCY: Well, yes,
but the problem is,

99
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,014
after I pick a room

100
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,683
and then settle in
with my erotica novels,

101
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,685
I never know if a guest
is going to check in

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,320
and disturb me.

103
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,256
I know this is Los Angeles,

104
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,691
but I'm an old-fashioned girl
and I like my privacy.

105
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:37,693
STEPHEN: I dig it when
the guests come in.

106
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,195
It's like a free dirty movie.

107
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,462
I'm into that amateur stuff.

108
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:41,930
(chuckles)

109
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,198
Are you three, like,
a thing now?

110
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,266
VENDELA:
Ya.

111
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,301
We try dating the lumberjack,

112
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,719
but he's a gay.

113
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,972
IRIS: Okay, everyone,
please, listen.

114
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,240
This is important,

115
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,708
and it affects every
single one of you.

116
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,779
We would like you
to stop killing the guests.

117
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:58,013
- (laughs)
- (murmuring)

118
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,148
LIZ:
It's not all of you,

119
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:00,816
but we are trying

120
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,251
to build something special here.

121
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:05,086
A real... destination.

122
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,954
Look, they're gonna get two
football teams down in Carson.

123
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,923
That's 20 minutes down the 110.

124
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,591
This place could be filled.

125
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,260
But if it gets out
that people are

126
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:14,928
checking in and disappearing,

127
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,326
then obviously,
that's bad for business.

128
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,999
Screw you, Iris.

129
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,668
You're the biggest
killer in this room,

130
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:23,369
- you bloodsucker.
- IRIS: Maybe in the past.

131
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:27,114
But every drop of blood
I drink now is donated.

132
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:29,810
Any murders that
go on in this hotel

133
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:32,121
are done by your kind.

134
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,813
Excuse me, but...

135
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,714
what do you mean by "our kind"?

136
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,382
SALLY:
Can we all just call

137
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:40,519
a spade a spade and say
you're talking about Will and I?

138
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:43,436
I mean, Woo is

139
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,324
too busy munching
on Swedish fish

140
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:46,302
to bother anyone.

141
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,427
Marcy molests herself

142
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,895
or complains all day.

143
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,563
The lumberjack just mopes.

144
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,933
And that hipster couple
just trips around

145
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,801
moaning about for kale.

146
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:58,570
Will and I are the only ones

147
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,740
who still get off on a
little bit of true mischief.

148
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,007
And we're not stopping.

149
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,976
Ending some jerk-off

150
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,212
who wastes the air
that he breathes?

151
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:09,648
That is the real high.

152
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:12,551
I'm dead, but I've
never felt more alive.

153
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:13,819
Ha.

154
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:15,086
(slow clapping)

155
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:18,690
Beautifully said.

156
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,425
And I couldn't agree more.

157
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,927
But I must come down
on the side of Cleopatra

158
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,996
and her friend on this issue.

159
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,364
SALLY:
Oh, come on!

160
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,399
You telling people
to stop killing

161
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,469
is like Colonel Sanders telling
us to stop eating chicken.

162
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,143
I'm not familiar
with your military friend

163
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,480
and his fondness for poultry,

164
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,640
but my killing days are over.

165
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:37,942
I thought
the Ten Commandment killings

166
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,377
were the beginning of my work,

167
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,312
but it turns out
that they are the epilogue.

168
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:45,516
The torch has been passed,
and I feel complete.

169
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:48,992
But this is a practical
decision, not an emotional one.

170
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,823
This is our home.

171
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,058
Frankly,
it's the only one we've got.

172
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,994
None of us know
what is waiting for us

173
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,296
beyond this place
if it no longer stands.

174
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,099
Perhaps, without these walls
to protect us, we would all be

175
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,701
forced to move on and face

176
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,423
the judgment of our Maker.

177
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,205
If we can't stay in business,
all bets are off.

178
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,273
We'll have to sell.

179
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:10,608
Or get evicted.

180
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:11,876
WILL:
That's bullshit.

181
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,443
I paid cash for this place.

182
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,545
My lawyers will keep
paying the upkeep and the taxes

183
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,958
for as long
as they have the funds.

184
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:19,783
Yeah, well, that's not gonna
take very long, cowboy.

185
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,885
Sure, your business
was worth a fortune

186
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,287
when you were alive.

187
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,122
But you're such a narcissist

188
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,158
that you never brought anyone
else in to design your lines.

189
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:31,128
And when you disappeared,
they had zilch.

190
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,630
Now the whole shithouse
has gone up in flames.

191
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,698
Your stock is worth pennies.

192
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,967
That is bullshit!

193
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,201
You're a goddamn liar.

194
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:39,868
Enough!
This is not a democracy!

195
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,137
We are not
in the House of Lords!

196
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,704
We are a ship at sea!

197
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,341
And when it comes
to you spirits, I am captain!

198
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,643
So listen up, mateys!

199
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,645
There are six criteria

200
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,847
that the U.S. Department
of Interior uses to determine

201
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,682
if a place is worthy
of being called

202
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,451
an historical landmark.

203
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,486
This hotel fits them all.

204
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,789
The one thing it does not
yet possess is time.

205
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,266
Age.

206
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:05,361
August 23, 2026.

207
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,996
That will make it 100 years
that this hotel has stood.

208
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,797
And on that day, it will earn
its rightful distinction

209
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,500
as an historical landmark.

210
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,336
They won't be able
to tear it down

211
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,837
even if they wanted to.

212
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,474
The killing must stop!

213
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,676
SALLY:
Oh, hell no.

214
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,945
Some of us can't go out
into the world

215
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,447
to find companionship,

216
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,349
so I'm not gonna stop
collecting souls

217
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,050
until I find my soul mate.
MARCH: Sally, I don't want

218
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,986
to get rough with you,
but you and I both know

219
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,553
there is a way to get
you to do as I please.

220
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,655
Or do you not recall
the last time you disobeyed me?

221
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,424
(muffled screaming,
drill whirring)

222
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,561
So, it's settled, then.

223
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:49,103
The point of being dead
is that there are no rules.

224
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,071
It's the only salvation.

225
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,340
Who gives a shit if they
tear this place down

226
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,442
and send us all
straight to hell?

227
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:58,012
It can't be any worse!

228
00:09:58,046 --> 00:09:59,045
(spits)

229
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:11,590
(knocking on door)

230
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,159
Go away!

231

Complimentary bottle

232
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,400

233
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:22,106
That's you, missy.

234
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:24,102
Save your breath.

235
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,004
I know what you're up to.

236
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,507
Your Kumbaya intrigues
might work with the others;

237
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,142
they're not gonna work with me.

238
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,143
Good.

239
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:33,145
We can cut the crap.

240
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,613
Jesus, you're one
lonely, miserable bitch.

241
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:38,983
Oh, there she is.

242
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,153
Now get the hell out of my room.

243
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,922
Don't you ever get tired
of being so goddamn bitter?

244
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,782
I want to help you, Sally.

245
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,693
This coming from the woman
who shoved me out of a window.

246
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:49,694
Okay.

247
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,496
That's on me.

248
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,832
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,668
Truly.

250
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:59,953
But it's no good for either
of us to dwell in the past.

251
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,190
Honey, you haven't been the same
since John left.

252
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,078
Watch it, Iris.

253
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:10,514
I can still take an ice pick
to your throat, anytime.

254
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,226
You loved him.

255
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,362
The only way you knew how.

256
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,898
He turned his back on you,

257
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,302
after all you'd done for him.

258
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,258
I know how that feels.

259
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:38,008
You don't know a damn thing
about how I feel.

260
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,344
About my pain.

261
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,739
The only thing
that takes the edge off

262
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,064
is when I can
pull people under with me.

263
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:53,256
Make them feel
one ounce of what I feel.

264
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,891
Then I'm not alone.

265
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,194
But don't you see?

266
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:01,897
All those people you've
been killing, it's...

267
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:04,033
they're just Band-Aids.

What if I knew of a
more permanent fix?

269
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,806
You could have
something long-lasting.

270
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,809
A future.

271

You've been living

279

We can't change the past,

280
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:49,903
but you can choose to
move forward and live.

keeping everything else afloat.

327
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,733
And you do matter
in the world, you know.

328
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:26,047
As long as it lives and
your son thrives, you matter.

329
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,862
I'm grateful for
what you've done for him.

330
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,668
Thatcher is one of the best
schools in the country,

331
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:35,847
and Ojai is year-round divine.

332
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:37,552
You should let him
come and visit you.

333
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:40,561
No. No.

334
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,667
This is no place
for a young man.

335
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:47,668
(chuckles)

336
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,911
All of the death here.

337
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,987
I don't want him to
be poisoned by it.

338
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,889
Even if it breaks my heart
that I can't see him.

339
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,726
May I make a proposition?

340
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,895
You're beautiful, but
you're not my type.

341
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,897
(laughs)

342
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,968
The trapped spirits
in this place

343
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,705
who aren't in perpetual misery
understand that

344
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,708
if you want to feel the magic
of cause and effect,

345
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,442
you have to have a purpose.

346
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,579
Your fashion house was iconic.

347
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,548
You're iconic.

348
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,249
My fashion house was
headed for disaster

349
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,223
long before I
"disappeared."

350
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,588
I haven't had
an original thought in a decade.

351
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,450
This is California!

352
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,359
The land of reinvention.

353
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,760
I mean,

354
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,163
look what this place did for me.

355
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,133
Where does everyone
even think I am?

356
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,569
Rumors abound.

357
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,573
Rehab, madness, illness.

358
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,075
Each one more scandalous
than the last.

359
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,679
Frankly,
it's marvelous publicity.

360
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,647
People love a mystery.

361
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,685
Sketch.

362
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,453
Create.

363
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,455
Be part of the world again.

364
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:10,393
Running a fashion house
is more than sketching.

365
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:13,964
More than any other business,
a line needs a face.

366
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,373
(chuckles):
Okay.

367
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:27,576
I was a salesman
in another life.

368
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,678
In this one,
I'm the mother of style.

369
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,547
Cut me and I bleed Dior.

370
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,087
And you don't have
to be dead, you know.

371
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,522
So you decided to hole up
in your happy place,

372
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,591
like Howard Hughes
without the crazy.

373
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,393
(whispers):
We can do this!

374
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,905
LIZ: Stepping into
the boardroom atop a pair

375

of five-inch Guccis, well,

376
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,656
that teaches the authority
this business needed.

377
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,770
You have to balance your frame,
consider each step,

378
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,605
and lean into your momentum.

379
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,007
You wind up elevated.

380
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,595
Gentlemen, I'm Liz Taylor.

381
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,230
Mr. Drake has sent me here

382
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,232
to lead this company
into the future.

383
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,300
Until Mr. Drake
has the courtesy

384
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,236
to appear before
this board himself...

385
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,438
Mr. Vice-Chairman,
I can assure you that Will Drake

386
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,473
has granted me full authority
to act on his behalf.

387
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:22,608
Well,

388
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,077
I don't accept your authority.

389
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:26,727
MAN: I'm afraid
you'll have to.

390
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,084
I've met with Will Drake
at the Hotel Cortez,

391
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:33,320
and it's official.

392
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,422
Ms. Taylor here
has total authority

393
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,290
to speak on his behalf.

394
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,659
You're fired.

00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:41,194
(chuckles)

396
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,334
Now, gentlemen,
I know something about rebirth.

397
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:51,437
Listen and learn.

398
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,439
WILL:
No! I can't do this!

399
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:58,845
There's inspiration
all around us.

400
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,880
All you got to do is look.

401
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,319
LIZ: I left Will alone
to work his sorcery,

402
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,687
and he left me to mine.

He gave very little of himself

and demand steadily rose.

407
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,600
His presentations were
exclusive and exotic.

Very few invitations,
very unusual models.

409
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,506
All cameras and phones
were banned,

410
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,641
which only made
word of mouth stronger,

It was a night like this
when I first saw Tristan.

422
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:11,447
Just promise me you'll
keep an open mind.

Please, remember
to whom you speak.

Now, what are we doing here?

425
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,057
I know how much
you miss Tristan.

And wherever he is, I don't know

why we haven't seen
hide nor hair of him.

I'm impressed.

00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,765
I'll be honest.

444
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,466
Your establishment
is fairly notorious

445
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,837
among the paranormal communities
being a bit of a hot spot.

(chuckles)

447
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,239
I was thinking I might want

448
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,941
to do an episode
of my show here.

Hmm.

00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,334
Hmm, so many voices.

453
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,370

Oh, I feel something.

00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,623
A very masculine energy.

Restless.

466
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,754
Tristan, I'm here with Liz.

467
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,456
She misses you very much.

468
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,493
Is there any message
you have for her?

469
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,199
What?

470
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,801
What does he say?

471
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,341
He says...

472
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,008
"No."

473
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,777
What do you mean, "No"?

474
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:00,945
What-what no?

475
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,779
He doesn't want to talk.

476
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,781
What do you mean?
He's talking to you.

477

He doesn't want to talk

479
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,955
He's been here all along.

480
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,958
And he's choosing not to talk
to me... (sniffles)

481
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,726
'cause he blames me.

482
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,895
I'm the cause of his death.

483
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,964
My love for him killed him.

484
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,765
Love doesn't kill.

485
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,472
I've been around a lot longer,
and let me tell you something.

486
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,440
Believe me, love kills
a lot more than hate.

487
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,612
Thank you for coming anyway.

488
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,517
Be strong.

489
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:44,653

Yep.

491
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,658
No. This isn't right.

492
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,561
- No, wait.
- (sighs)

493
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:55,598
Maybe it wasn't Tristan
you were talking to.

494
00:23:57,422 --> 00:24:00,869
He remembers the pancakes.

495
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,753
The ones with the blueberries.

496
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,074
You made them for him
every Saturday

497
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,976
and let him watch cartoons
all morning.

498
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,611
Who's Donovan?

499
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,646
What?

500
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,417
Donovan isn't here.

501
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,085
No, no, no.

502
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,921
Donovan is someplace else.

503
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:22,124
Someplace very beautiful.

504
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,327
He says it smells like pancakes.

505
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,297
Your pancakes.

506
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:33,067
He says it's always
Saturday morning where he is.

507
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,571
He says...

508
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,008
"I love you, Mom."

509
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:44,979
LIZ: Even in my grief,
I was happy for my friend.

510
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:48,583
As for me, I felt
any chance at love was over.

511
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,919
But life can surprise you.

512
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:53,688
Especially new life.

513
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:56,591
(screaming)

514
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,159
And love?

515
00:24:58,193 --> 00:25:00,428
Well, that can take many forms.

516
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:03,130
After I made peace
with my son Douglas,

517
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,333
I never really expected
to see him again.

518
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,369
So I was delighted when
he brought Janice to meet me.

519
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:10,972
Janice was the daughter
I always wanted.

520
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,307
And I was the mother-in-law
she'd always hoped for.

521
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:14,541
(baby crying)

522
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:17,511
In Isabelle's face,
I saw the future.

523
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:21,181
She was being born into a world
just a little more accepting

524
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,183
than the one
I had been born into.

525
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,352
And maybe, just maybe,

526
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:28,321
I had a little something
to do with that.

527
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:31,157
A little kindness, acceptance.

528
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:35,662
That transformed me in ways
nothing else ever could.

529
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:38,231
I never thought life
could be this good.

530
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:43,603
Or that it might end.

531
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,638
Well, shit!

532
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,140
Are you sure?

533
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:48,274
I'm sure.

534
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,609
Well...

535
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:51,478
the doctor is sure.

536
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:53,846
And there ain't nothing
they can do about it?

537
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:57,683
It's... past the point
of treatment.

538
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:00,720
Which is probably for the best.

539
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:03,723
'Cause...

540
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:05,958
I would hate to lose my hair.

541
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:10,763
Baby girl,

542
00:26:10,797 --> 00:26:13,633
there just might be something
that I can do for you.

543
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,267
- (scoffs)
- Huh?

544
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:16,602
What, turn me?

545
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:18,704
Hell, I don't even
like my steak bloody.

546
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:20,272
But that's never been
an option for me.

547
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,473
You know that.

548
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:24,544
And at this point in my life,

549
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:28,380
I can't imagine killing
in order to live.

550
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,670
So have you told your kids yet?

551
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,219
With any luck, I won't need to.

552
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,522
They can just keep
visiting me here.

553
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:41,726
(camera clicking)

554
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:43,161
(chuckles)

555
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,102
(chuckles)

556
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,905
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

557
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,542
I am the first woman in the
world to have prostate cancer.

558
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:01,713
Uh, the doctor told me
it's spread to the spine

559
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,348
and there's nothing to do.

560
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:11,622
We'll spend whatever we have to.

561
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:14,292
One call and I can get you
to the best doctor in the world.

562
00:27:14,326 --> 00:27:15,493
Oh, it's too late.

563
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:18,129
And I don't want to spend

564
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:20,131
my last days wasting away
in a hospital

565
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:22,433
with a catheter up my dick
and poison in my body,

566
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:24,435
so...

567
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,637
But who will take care of us?

568
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,772
You can't leave us alone.
I won't.

569
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:30,941
That's why I called you all
here today.

570
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:35,713
Now, I have provided you
with various weapons.

571
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:38,315
Take two. They're small.
(chuckles)

572
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,550
Uh...

573
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,519
hack me.

574
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:44,554
Strangle me.

575
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,657
Bludgeon me.

576
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:49,660
Surprise me.

577
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:52,529
MS. EVERS: I think I can speak
for everyone here when I say

578
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,964
that we've all grown
rather fond of you.

579
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,933
We can't possibly murder you.

580
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,468
SALLY:
It's not murder.

581
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:01,271
She wants to be reborn.

I don't understand.

621
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,776
You wouldn't talk to me.

625
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:12,724
you had more living to do.

626
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:14,759
I couldn't get
in the way of that.

(laughs)

628

Oh, baby...

629
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:25,637
you are to die for.

630
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:37,328
- May I help you?
- I have a reservation.

631
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:38,648
Room 44.

632
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,284
The Woo room.

633
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,852
That's where Billie Dean
says he died.

634
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:43,493
Oh, that room is booked.

635
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,689
Booked by me, three weeks ago.

636
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,457
Under Rhodes, Ashley.

637
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,827
My Amex app
says the charge has cleared.

638
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:52,662
You have my money.
I want my room.

639
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:55,465
Fine.

640
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,838
It's all my fault.

641
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,973
I thought that Billie'd be
free advertising.

642
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,142
You know, people love
a good ghost story.

643
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,845
Well, you were right about that.

644
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,513
Yeah, but this is getting
way out of hand.

645
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:14,317
She's had
three prime-time specials.

646
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,618
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

647
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:18,687
Wait, he's trying
to tell me something.

648
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,802
Mr. Woo doesn't pay for what?

649
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,398
IRIS:
I mean, don't get me wrong.

650
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:29,065
I don't mind having this place
alive with guests.

651
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,368
It's just
those freaks and weirdos

652
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,270
who want to be
plowed by a ghost.

653
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:35,209
The people Billie attracts,
they're just...

654
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,809
It's bad for our brand.

655
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,437
Why don't we just
shut the place down?

656
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,939
Will Drake doesn't need
the money anymore.

657
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,242
'Cause this place needs life.

658
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,577
It's a hotel, not a cemetery.

659
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:48,679
The living give the spirits
trapped in this place

660
00:32:48,714 --> 00:32:50,581
a connection
to the outside world.

661
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:52,149
IRIS:
John.

662
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,852
I was wondering when
you were gonna arrive.

663
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,420
We've missed you.

664
00:32:56,913 --> 00:32:59,750
It's good to be back.
And you're right.

665
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:01,804
I don't like her coming around.

666
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,772
Pestering, asking questions.

667
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,290
She still trying to contact me?

668
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,910
Every year on this date.

669
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,481
John Lowe.

670
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:14,217
The Ten Commandments Killer.

671
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:17,253
Show yourself and bear witness
to your crimes.

672
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,429
Shit.

673
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,897
Call her.

674
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:30,398
Check her into my room.

675
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:31,867
But get her here quickly.

676
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,769
It's only three hours
until sundown.

677
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:46,014
We are standing in room 64
of the Hotel Cortez,

678
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:48,683
where the notorious
Ten Commandments Killer lived

679
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,285
when he terrorized Los Angeles
many years ago.

680
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:55,256
John Lowe may be the most evil
and dangerous spirit

681
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,359
with whom I have ever attempted
to make contact.

682
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:02,764
I will need all of my skills
and powers of concentration

683
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,400
to achieve
this unprecedented interview.

684
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:11,773
(sighs softly)

685
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:18,345
(static hums softly)

686
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,981
You wanted to talk?

687
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:26,620
I want you to talk.

688
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:29,122
My name is Billie Dean Howard.

689
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,811
All we know about John Lowe
is what the police have said.

690
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:38,265
I'm giving you a chance now
to set the record straight.

691
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,936
(chuckles softly)

692
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,274
(mouthing)

693
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:58,217
What do you want to know?

694
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:03,088
Why don't we start
with your family.

695
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:04,657
Did they know

696
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,292
you were a serial killer?

697
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:09,554
- What'd you get Holden for dinner?
- It's dog again.

698
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:10,860
JOHN:
They came to understand

699
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:12,706
that I was
cleaning up the world,

700
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:14,894
- in my own way.
ALEX: Goddamn it, John.

701
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,857
We talked about this;
I was not gonna target people

702
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:18,326
who do not deserve to die.

703
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,127
Now, once you went on the lam,

704
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:23,197
your wife and two children
were never seen again.

705
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:24,098
ALEX:
Come on.

706
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,599
- Where are you going?
- He's hungry.

707
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:26,767
I know how to walk into
a hospital

708
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:27,768
and not get noticed.

709
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:29,670
Did you kill them?

710
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:33,274
I will admit, I failed them.

711
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,286
Daddy?

712
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,156
There's only one
thing left to do.

713
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,659
Turn myself in?

714
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,695
We have to go home.

715
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,002
JOHN:
Scarlett was right.

716
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,837
The Cortez was home.

717
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:07,239
We'd all been reborn there,
in one form or another.

718
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:09,441
Well, except for her.

719
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:11,443
There was a still a chance
for our daughter

720
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:13,379
to grow up somewhere else,

721
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:16,415
to have some shot
at a normal life.

722
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,485
But it needed to be
away from us.

723
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,453
Liz knew just the place.

724
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,322
The Thatcher School
would be host

725
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:27,291
to more than one young refugee
from the Hotel Cortez.

726
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:30,428
BILLIE:
So you sent your daughter away,

727
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:33,632
but lived with your son
and wife in the Cortez,

728
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:37,636
back in L.A., where you were
still being hunted.

729
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,039
It's hard to provide for your
family when you're on the run.

730
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:45,176
There were more opportunities
in Los Angeles.

731
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:55,920
(grunts)

732
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:03,694
♪

733
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:24,147
(tires screeching,
sirens wailing)

734
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:27,784
OFFICER: Stop! John Lowe,
you're under arrest!

735
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:29,719
I have to make it back
to the hotel.

736
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:31,555
(gunfire)

737
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:54,042
(wheezing)

738
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:55,444
Let me...

739
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,924
I want to die inside.

740
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:05,754
I'm sensing something
about your wife and son.

741
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:10,695
I can hear the undercurrents
from the spirits,

742
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:12,998
but they are too afraid
to speak clearly.

743
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,866
Why is that?

744
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,602
I don't want to talk
about my family.

745
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:19,504
Well, if you don't want
to talk about your family,

746
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:20,905
then give me something else.

747
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,844
What is the significance
of October 30?

748
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:29,613
Why is it the only day
I feel your presence here?

749
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:34,018
Well, it's Devil's Night.

750
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:37,521
And if you leave your
camera crew behind,

751
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:39,556
that I can show you.

752
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,817
They're screaming.

753
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:04,820
I was in a house once
just west of here.

754
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:09,591
And I could hear the spirits
in the walls like termites...

755
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:13,575
or bats in the attic.

756
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:16,678
But it was nothing like this.

757
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:21,082
This is like being
in a rock concert of the dead.

758
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,119
Well, come on.

759
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,055
Let me introduce you to some
rock stars of the dead.

760
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,658
(jazz music playing)

761
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:31,660
Oh, Jeffrey,
you and your damn straws.

762
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:36,097
Come on. Put your drink down
and come and dance with me.

763
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:38,166
I don't dance.

764
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,000
Look at me.

765
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,003
Neither do I.
(laughs)

766
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:45,839
John! Oh!

767
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:48,842
Jeffrey, look who's here.

768
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:50,444
John is here.

769
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:52,879
He's the greatest of them all.

770
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,881
Are you blushing?

771
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:58,485
I told you, if you like a guy,
you have to talk to him.

772
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,487
You think any of those young men

773
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:02,888
would have come over to work
at my house if I didn't have

774
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,858
the guts to approach
them in the world?

775
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:07,560
(scoffs)

776
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:10,162
Well, those guys in Milwaukee
must have been pretty desperate

777
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:11,831
to go home with Jeffrey.

778
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:14,500
The guy can't get two words
out without going flush.

779
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:15,802
(laughs)

780
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,971
Oh, my God.

781
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:21,006
You're John Wayne Gacy.

782
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:26,278
And that's Jeffrey Dahmer.

783
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:31,350
Are you frightened?

784
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:34,019
Oh, no.

785
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:38,881
No, I just surround myself with
the white light of spirit and...

786
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,294
to keep myself protected.

787
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,073
Sure thing, sweetheart.

788
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,632
Yeah! Let's get
this party started!

789
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,869
I need a beer.
I'll drink whatever's cold.

790
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:53,505
Jesus H. Christ on a horse, what
the hell is this shit music?

791
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:55,040
Aileen Wuornos.

Richard Ramirez.

794
00:40:58,677 --> 00:41:01,246
I'm married, but we live apart.

795
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:09,087
And that's the Zodiac.

796
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:11,389
I'll get you a drink.

797
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:19,597
♪ I want to hold the hand
inside you... ♪

I'm Aileen.

You have the prettiest hair.

00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:33,643
Man, what I wouldn't do for
a head of hair like that.

803
00:41:33,677 --> 00:41:36,146
It's like... it's
like Farrah Fawcett.

804

ex-girlfriend.

All these dark spirits.

807
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:46,923
It's... (chuckles)
it's a little overwhelming.

808
00:41:46,957 --> 00:41:49,926
Just drink that.
It'll relax you.

Oh, I feel the violence in you.

So many spirits
who you snuffed out.

815
00:42:16,748 --> 00:42:21,022
I can see all the moments
when they crossed over.

816
00:42:21,057 --> 00:42:23,492
Tell me,

817
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:25,293
what is that like?

818
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:28,296
Is it a moving picture, like
so many cells on a film reel?

819
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:31,032
Or more like a kaleidoscope
of human suffering?

820
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,159
It's not a picture.

821
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:35,434
It's a feeling.

822
00:42:36,296 --> 00:42:40,240
Like a mist on your face
on a cold morning.

823
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:45,980
You can't see it in the air,
but you can feel...

824
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:47,782
the wetness.

825
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,784
Yeah. I can feel
the wetness

826
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,019
with you so close to me
right now, Johnny boy.

828

So this is Devil's Night.

833
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,481
My Murderers' Row!

834
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,147
How odd it must be
to see all of us then

835
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,486
in what appears to be the flesh.

836
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,022
Flesh enough to eat,

837

drink,

838
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:33,660

839
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,762
our breath on your skin.

840

(shouts) No!

holding up, Billie Dean?

BILLIE:
I don't want to be here anymore.

When does
the party favor arrive?

No. (screams)

Can't throw a killer party
without a little killing, right?

Don't worry, Billie.

I think you're gonna like
living here.

Here's the deal.

856
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,598
No more specials or interviews

857

or books or tweets
or casual conversations

858

This place is dead to you.

861
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:22,141
We will become a myth,

862
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,943

left to do anyway.

AILEEN: One sure-as-shit thing
I can tell you

00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:31,383
about being murdered: it hurts.

866
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:34,752
And we like to make it last...

leave the hotel, so...

869
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:43,765
you can't hold me
to my word, huh?

But I can.

BILLIE:

You're not dead.

I'm a creature

874

who kills to live

875
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:01,245
and who drinks a body's worth
of blood a day

876
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:02,712
and doesn't think twice about

So, if you even let out
a whisper of a word

that sounds like "Cortez,"

I'll find you
