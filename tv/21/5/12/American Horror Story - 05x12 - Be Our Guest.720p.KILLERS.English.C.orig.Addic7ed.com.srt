00:00:01,341 --> 00:00:03,976
×ÖÄ»
We started with such high hopes.

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:06,278
×ÖÄ»
With all the previous owners being dead,

3
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:10,115
×ÖÄ»
the hotel was under new management-- ours.

4
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:12,417
×ÖÄ»
We were determined to remake the Cortez

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,619
×ÖÄ»
in our own image.

6
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,754
×ÖÄ»
This would be no mere hotel.

7
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,590
×ÖÄ»
We had ambitions to be a family to the friendless,

8
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,759
×ÖÄ»
a comfort to those in the cold,

9
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:25,096
×ÖÄ»
a beehive of acceptance.

10
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:29,260
×ÖÄ»
It was supposed to be the perfect ending.

11
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,057
×ÖÄ»
Oh, hello. Hello.

12
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,159
×ÖÄ»
Welcome to the Cortez.

13
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,293
×ÖÄ»
Please, sign our guest book.

14
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,762
×ÖÄ»
Sure.

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,930
×ÖÄ»
May I offer the two of you a glass of champagne?

16
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,331
×ÖÄ»
- Ooh. - Don't mind if I do.

17
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:52,267
×ÖÄ»
Ah.

18
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,603
×ÖÄ»
I think those are the reviewers

19
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,006
×ÖÄ»
from that Internet site, Trip Adventurers.

20
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,375
×ÖÄ»
They must've heard about our grand reopening.

21
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,943
×ÖÄ»
I know.

22
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,379
×ÖÄ»
Can't you see the ridiculously gracious smile

23
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,314
×ÖÄ»
plastered on my face?

24
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:11,719
×ÖÄ»
What is that pungent odor?

25
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,755
×ÖÄ»
Sage. To cleanse the spirit.

26
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,124
×ÖÄ»
I'll show you to your room.

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,095
×ÖÄ»
To polish the jewel that is the Cortez,

28
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,964
×ÖÄ»
it required not only money-- which we got from liquidating

29
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,767
×ÖÄ»
the Countess's numerous pieces of art--

30
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:30,137
×ÖÄ»
it was going to take four stars on the Internet.

31
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,972
×ÖÄ»
And so, we were off.

32
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:40,611
×ÖÄ»
We haven't finished with every floor, but this is one of

33
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:43,049
×ÖÄ»
our newly refreshed rooms.

34
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,205
×ÖÄ»
Egyptian cotton.

00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,552

400 thread count.

36
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:46,482
×ÖÄ»
Minibar?

37
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,432
×ÖÄ»
Mixers are on the house.

38
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:50,357
×ÖÄ»
If there's anything else you need,

39
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,858
×ÖÄ»
just pick up the phone.

40
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:52,904
×ÖÄ»
Thank you.

41
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:54,542
×ÖÄ»
Enjoy your stay.

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,062
×ÖÄ»
And you were ready to give it a pass.

43
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:01,100
×ÖÄ»
Kill me.

44
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:04,970
×ÖÄ»
Are you kidding?

45
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,734
×ÖÄ»
That's a Toto Neorest 700H, baby.

46
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,808
×ÖÄ»
The Japanese self-cleaning wonder toilet.

×ÖÄ»
Oh.

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,080
×ÖÄ»
I have always wanted to try one of these.

49
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,271
×ÖÄ»
Doesn't it just make you want to take a dump?

50
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,818
×ÖÄ»
Who the hell are you?

51
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,320
×ÖÄ»
How did you get in here?

52
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:27,359
×ÖÄ»
I got to say, it's a nice room.

53
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:31,670
×ÖÄ»
They spent every penny they had to change everything they could.

54
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,083
×ÖÄ»
They took out the mattresses,

55
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:35,834
×ÖÄ»
especially the ones I split open.

56
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,903
×ÖÄ»
Took out the carpets,

57
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:41,740
×ÖÄ»
soaked through with so many years

58
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,209
×ÖÄ»
of piss and blood.

59
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,113
×ÖÄ»
They even changed the furniture.

60
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,016
×ÖÄ»
But you know what they couldn't take out?

61
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,653
×ÖÄ»
The pain.

62
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:58,156
×ÖÄ»
'Cause I'm still here.

63
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,924
×ÖÄ»
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

64
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,159

- Now. - Hey.

65
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,560

Oh! God!

Oh, God! Oh, God!

Call the police!

Some crazy bitch just killed my partner!

69

Please... ah!

70
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,574

Oh, my God. Oh!

Oh, God.

72
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,911

Please, you got to help me!

73
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:22,614
×ÖÄ»
No, no. You have to help me.

74
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,248
×ÖÄ»
I'm new at this murder game,

75
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:26,751
×ÖÄ»
and, Jesus Christ, is it a thrill.

76
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,996
×ÖÄ»
Ah, crap.

77
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,098
×ÖÄ»
We got another one down at the end of the hallway.

78
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,432
×ÖÄ»
Damn it.

79
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,167
×ÖÄ»
This has got to stop.

80
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,869
×ÖÄ»
He stained the new carpet.

81
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,838
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, we got a serious problem.

82
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,706
×ÖÄ»
The ghosts keep killing the guests,

83
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,042
×ÖÄ»
we're gonna end up with zero stars.

84
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:57,313

It's time we had a goddamn meeting.

My understanding is that you two are in charge now,

89
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:17,353

Sweetheart, you're a ghost.

You can choose whatever room you'd like.

92
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,490
×ÖÄ»
Well, yes, but the problem is,

93
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,014
×ÖÄ»
after I pick a room

94
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,683
×ÖÄ»
and then settle in with my erotica novels,

95
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,685
×ÖÄ»
I never know if a guest is going to check in

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,320
×ÖÄ»
and disturb me.

97
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,256
×ÖÄ»
I know this is Los Angeles,

98
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,691
×ÖÄ»
but I'm an old-fashioned girl and I like my privacy.

99
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:37,693
×ÖÄ»
I dig it when the guests come in.

100
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,195
×ÖÄ»
It's like a free dirty movie.

101
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,462
×ÖÄ»
I'm into that amateur stuff.

102
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,198

Are you three, like, a thing now?

×ÖÄ»
Ya.

104
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,301
×ÖÄ»
We try dating the lumberjack,

105
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,719
×ÖÄ»
but he's a gay.

106
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,972
×ÖÄ»
Okay, everyone, please, listen.

107
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,240
×ÖÄ»
This is important,

108
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,708
×ÖÄ»
and it affects every single one of you.

109
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,779
×ÖÄ»
We would like you to stop killing the guests.

110
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,148
×ÖÄ»
It's not all of you,

111
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:00,816
×ÖÄ»
but we are trying

to build something special here.

113

×ÖÄ»
A real... destination.

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,954

Look, they're gonna get two football teams down in Carson.

115
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,923
×ÖÄ»
That's 20 minutes down the 110.

116
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,591
×ÖÄ»
This place could be filled.

117
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,260
×ÖÄ»
But if it gets out that people are

118
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:14,928
×ÖÄ»
checking in and disappearing,

119
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,326
×ÖÄ»
then obviously, that's bad for business.

×ÖÄ»
Screw you, Iris.

121

You're the biggest killer in this room,

- you bloodsucker. - Maybe in the past.

123

But every drop of blood I drink now is donated.

Any murders that go on in this hotel

Excuse me, but...

00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,714
×ÖÄ»
what do you mean by "Our kind"?

128
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,382

Can we all just call

a spade a spade and say you're talking about Will and I?

I mean, Woo is

too busy munching on Swedish fish

Marcy molests herself

or complains all day.

135
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,563
×ÖÄ»
The lumberjack just mopes.

136
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,933
×ÖÄ»
And that hipster couple just trips around

137
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,801
×ÖÄ»
moaning about for kale.

138
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:58,570
×ÖÄ»
Will and I are the only ones

139
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,740

who still get off on a little bit of true mischief.

140
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,007

And we're not stopping.

Ending some jerk-off

who wastes the air that he breathes?

143
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:09,648
×ÖÄ»
That is the real high.

144
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:12,551
×ÖÄ»
I'm dead, but I've never felt more alive.

Ha.

146

Beautifully said.

And I couldn't agree more.

148

and her friend on this issue.

150
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,364
×ÖÄ»
Oh, come on!

151
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,399
×ÖÄ»
You telling people to stop killing

152
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,469
×ÖÄ»
is like Colonel Sanders telling us to stop eating chicken.

153
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,143
×ÖÄ»
I'm not familiar with your military friend

154
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,480
×ÖÄ»
and his fondness for poultry,

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,640
×ÖÄ»
but my killing days are over.

156
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:37,942
×ÖÄ»
I thought the Ten Commandment killings

157
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,377
×ÖÄ»
were the beginning of my work,

158
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,312
×ÖÄ»
but it turns out that they are the epilogue.

159
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:45,516
×ÖÄ»
The torch has been passed, and I feel complete.

160
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:48,992
×ÖÄ»
But this is a practical decision, not an emotional one.

161
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,823
×ÖÄ»
This is our home.

162
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,058
×ÖÄ»
Frankly, it's the only one we've got.

163
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,994
×ÖÄ»
None of us know what is waiting for us

164
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,296
×ÖÄ»
beyond this place if it no longer stands.

165
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,099
×ÖÄ»
Perhaps, without these walls to protect us, we would all be

166
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,701
×ÖÄ»
forced to move on and face

167
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,423
×ÖÄ»
the judgment of our Maker.

168
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,205
×ÖÄ»
If we can't stay in business, all bets are off.

169
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,273
×ÖÄ»
We'll have to sell.

170
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:10,608
×ÖÄ»
Or get evicted.

171
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:11,876
×ÖÄ»
That's bullshit.

172
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,443
×ÖÄ»
I paid cash for this place.

173
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,545
×ÖÄ»
My lawyers will keep paying the upkeep and the taxes

174
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,958
×ÖÄ»
for as long as they have the funds.

175
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:19,783
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, well, that's not gonna take very long, cowboy.

176
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,885
×ÖÄ»
Sure, your business was worth a fortune

177
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,287
×ÖÄ»
when you were alive.

178
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,122
×ÖÄ»
But you're such a narcissist

179
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,158
×ÖÄ»
that you never brought anyone else in to design your lines.

180
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:31,128
×ÖÄ»
And when you disappeared, they had zilch.

181
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,630
×ÖÄ»
Now the whole shithouse has gone up in flames.

182
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,698
×ÖÄ»
Your stock is worth pennies.

183
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,967
×ÖÄ»
That is bullshit!

184
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,201
×ÖÄ»
You're a goddamn liar.

185
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:39,868
×ÖÄ»
Enough! This is not a democracy!

186
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,137
×ÖÄ»
We are not in the House of Lords!

187
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,704
×ÖÄ»
We are a ship at sea!

188
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,341
×ÖÄ»
And when it comes to you spirits, I am captain!

189
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,643
×ÖÄ»
So listen up, mateys!

190
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,645
×ÖÄ»
There are six criteria

191
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,847
×ÖÄ»
that the U.S. Department of Interior uses to determine

192
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,682
×ÖÄ»
if a place is worthy of being called

193
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,451
×ÖÄ»
an historical landmark.

194
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,486
×ÖÄ»
This hotel fits them all.

195
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,789
×ÖÄ»
The one thing it does not yet possess is time.

196
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,266
×ÖÄ»
Age.

197
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:05,361
×ÖÄ»
August 23, 2026.

198
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,996
×ÖÄ»
That will make it 100 years that this hotel has stood.

199
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,797
×ÖÄ»
And on that day, it will earn its rightful distinction

200
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,500
×ÖÄ»
as an historical landmark.

201
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,336
×ÖÄ»
They won't be able to tear it down

202
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,837
×ÖÄ»
even if they wanted to.

203
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,474
×ÖÄ»
The killing must stop!

204
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,676
×ÖÄ»
Oh, hell no.

205
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,945
×ÖÄ»
Some of us can't go out into the world

206
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,447
×ÖÄ»
to find companionship,

207
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,349
×ÖÄ»
so I'm not gonna stop collecting souls

208
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,050
×ÖÄ»
- until I find my soul mate. - Sally, I don't want

209
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,986
×ÖÄ»
to get rough with you, but you and I both know

210
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,553
×ÖÄ»
there is a way to get you to do as I please.

211
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,655
×ÖÄ»
Or do you not recall the last time you disobeyed me?

212
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,561
×ÖÄ»
So, it's settled, then.

213
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:49,103
×ÖÄ»
The point of being dead is that there are no rules.

214
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,071
×ÖÄ»
It's the only salvation.

215
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,340
×ÖÄ»
Who gives a shit if they tear this place down

216
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,442
×ÖÄ»
and send us all straight to hell?

217
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:58,012
×ÖÄ»
It can't be any worse!

218
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,159
×ÖÄ»
Go away!

219
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,397
×ÖÄ»
Complimentary bottle of champagne

for our VIP long-term residents.

221
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:22,106
×ÖÄ»
That's you, missy.

222
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:24,102
×ÖÄ»
Save your breath.

223
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,004
×ÖÄ»
I know what you're up to.

224
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,507
×ÖÄ»
Your Kumbaya intrigues might work with the others;

225
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,142
×ÖÄ»
they're not gonna work with me.

226
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,143
×ÖÄ»
Good.

227
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:33,145
×ÖÄ»
We can cut the crap.

228
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,613
×ÖÄ»
Jesus, you're one lonely, miserable bitch.

229
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:38,983
×ÖÄ»
Oh, there she is.

230
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,153
×ÖÄ»
Now get the hell out of my room.

231
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,922
×ÖÄ»
Don't you ever get tired of being so goddamn bitter?

232
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,782
×ÖÄ»
I want to help you, Sally.

233
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,693
×ÖÄ»
This coming from the woman who shoved me out of a window.

234
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:49,694
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

235
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,496
×ÖÄ»
That's on me.

236
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,832
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,668
×ÖÄ»
Truly.

238
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:59,953
×ÖÄ»
But it's no good for either of us to dwell in the past.

239
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,190
×ÖÄ»
Honey, you haven't been the same since John left.

240
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,078
×ÖÄ»
Watch it, Iris.

241
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:10,514
×ÖÄ»
I can still take an ice pick to your throat, anytime.

242
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,226
×ÖÄ»
You loved him.

243
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,362
×ÖÄ»
The only way you knew how.

244
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,898
×ÖÄ»
He turned his back on you,

245
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,302
×ÖÄ»
after all you'd done for him.

246
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,258
×ÖÄ»
I know how that feels.

247
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:38,008
×ÖÄ»
You don't know a damn thing about how I feel.

248
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,344
×ÖÄ»
About my pain.

249
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,739
×ÖÄ»
The only thing that takes the edge off

250
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,064
×ÖÄ»
is when I can pull people under with me.

251
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:53,256
×ÖÄ»
Make them feel one ounce of what I feel.

252
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,891
×ÖÄ»
Then I'm not alone.

253
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,194
×ÖÄ»
But don't you see?

254
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:01,897
×ÖÄ»
All those people you've been killing, it's...

255
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:04,033
×ÖÄ»
they're just Band-Aids.

256
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:08,204
×ÖÄ»
What if I knew of a more permanent fix?

257
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,806
×ÖÄ»
You could have something long-lasting.

258
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,809
×ÖÄ»
A future.

259
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:16,312
×ÖÄ»
What future?

260
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:17,913
×ÖÄ»
I'm dead.

261
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:20,549
×ÖÄ»
You've been living in a 1994 world.

262
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,351
×ÖÄ»
Times have changed.

263
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:27,541
×ÖÄ»
The Cortez is proud to offer free Wi-Fi now in every room.

264
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:34,730

Here's your ticket to adventure.

265
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,269
×ÖÄ»
Go on, open it.

266
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,474
×ÖÄ»
What am I supposed to do with this?

267
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,242
×ÖÄ»
We can't change the past,

268
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:49,903
×ÖÄ»
but you can choose to move forward and live.

269
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:50,812
×ÖÄ»
So what?

270
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:52,814
×ÖÄ»
I-I'm gonna be the ghost in the machine?

271
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:55,717
×ÖÄ»
That's exactly what you're gonna be.

272
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,719
×ÖÄ»
Okay, look.

273
00:12:57,753 --> 00:13:00,689
×ÖÄ»
I loaded it up for you

out in the world to be a part of it.

277
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:10,899
×ÖÄ»
In the modern age, no one ever has to be alone.

278
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,867
×ÖÄ»
Even for a second.

279

×ÖÄ»
There's a whole world out there waiting to embrace you, Sally.

Come on, all you have to do is dive in.

281
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,818
×ÖÄ»
Sally took to the interwebs like a fish to water.

282
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:34,488
×ÖÄ»
It was as if everything she did

283
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,423
×ÖÄ»
shot out a pulse of electricity.

284
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,410
×ÖÄ»
And from all the corners of the globe,

285
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,077
×ÖÄ»
people responded.

286
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,882
×ÖÄ»
In droves, tingling for more.

287
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:48,547
×ÖÄ»
A rapt audience welcoming her with open arms,

×ÖÄ»
desperate to connect, hanging onto her every word.

289
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:56,027

Suddenly the girl no one wanted became the belle of the ball.

290
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:58,395
×ÖÄ»
She could say anything, bare her soul.

291
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:02,166
×ÖÄ»
Her lone voice weaving into its own cyber subculture.

292
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:05,169
×ÖÄ»
A safe harbor.

it to feel you're higher... â™? 295 00:14: 00:14:13,744 As she basked in sublime adoration,

295
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:17,748
×ÖÄ»
being numb to the world finally lost its appeal.

296
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,969
×ÖÄ»
Another?

297
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,908
×ÖÄ»
How long have I been dead?

298
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,910
×ÖÄ»
It's over a year now.

299
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,845
×ÖÄ»
How long does it feel like?

300
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,846
×ÖÄ»
Like I don't exist.

301
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:57,786
×ÖÄ»
Is that why you've been acting out and killing those people?

302
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,356
×ÖÄ»
I had no idea that my business was dead.

303
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:04,760
×ÖÄ»
Oh, it's not dead. It's dying.

304
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,423
×ÖÄ»
Well, what have they done with it?

305
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,430
×ÖÄ»
Factories?

306
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:11,344
×ÖÄ»
The stores on Rodeo, Fifth Avenue?

307
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:14,157
×ÖÄ»
Well, they shuttered the couture division.

308
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:18,672
×ÖÄ»
The perfumes and sunglasses are keeping everything else afloat.

309
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,733
×ÖÄ»
And you do matter in the world, you know.

310
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:26,047
×ÖÄ»
As long as it lives and your son thrives, you matter.

311
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,862
×ÖÄ»
I'm grateful for what you've done for him.

312
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,668

Thatcher is one of the best schools in the country,

and Ojai is year-round divine.

314
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:37,552
×ÖÄ»
You should let him come and visit you.

315
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:40,561
×ÖÄ»
No. No.

316
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,667
×ÖÄ»
This is no place for a young man.

×ÖÄ»
All of the death here.

318
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,987

I don't want him to be poisoned by it.

319
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,889
×ÖÄ»
Even if it breaks my heart that I can't see him.

320
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,726
×ÖÄ»
May I make a proposition?

321
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,895
×ÖÄ»
You're beautiful, but you're not my type.

322
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,968
×ÖÄ»
The trapped spirits in this place

323
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,705

who aren't in perpetual misery understand that

324
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,708
×ÖÄ»
if you want to feel the magic of cause and effect,

325
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,442
×ÖÄ»
you have to have a purpose.

326
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,579
×ÖÄ»
Your fashion house was iconic.

327
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,548
×ÖÄ»
You're iconic.

328
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,249
×ÖÄ»
My fashion house was headed for disaster

329
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,223
×ÖÄ»
long before I "Disappeared."

330
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,588
×ÖÄ»
I haven't had an original thought in a decade.

331
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,450
×ÖÄ»
This is California!

332
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,359
×ÖÄ»
The land of reinvention.

333
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,760
×ÖÄ»
I mean,

334
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,163
×ÖÄ»
look what this place did for me.

335
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,133
×ÖÄ»
Where does everyone even think I am?

336
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,569
×ÖÄ»
Rumors abound.

337
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,573
×ÖÄ»
Rehab, madness, illness.

338
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,075
×ÖÄ»
Each one more scandalous than the last.

339
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,679
×ÖÄ»
Frankly, it's marvelous publicity.

340
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,647
×ÖÄ»
People love a mystery.

341
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,685
×ÖÄ»
Sketch.

342
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,453
×ÖÄ»
Create.

343
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,455
×ÖÄ»
Be part of the world again.

344
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:10,393
×ÖÄ»
Running a fashion house is more than sketching.

345
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:13,964
×ÖÄ»
More than any other business, a line needs a face.

346
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,373
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

347
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:27,576
×ÖÄ»
I was a salesman in another life.

348
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,678
×ÖÄ»
In this one, I'm the mother of style.

349
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,547
×ÖÄ»
Cut me and I bleed Dior.

350
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,087
×ÖÄ»
And you don't have to be dead, you know.

351
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,522
×ÖÄ»
So you decided to hole up in your happy place,

352
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,591
×ÖÄ»
like Howard Hughes without the crazy.

353
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,393
×ÖÄ»
We can do this!

354
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,905
×ÖÄ»
Stepping into the boardroom atop a pair

355
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,703
×ÖÄ»
of five-inch Guccis, well,

356
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,656
×ÖÄ»
that teaches the authority this business needed.

357
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,770
×ÖÄ»
You have to balance your frame, consider each step,

358
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,605
×ÖÄ»
and lean into your momentum.

359
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,007

You wind up elevated.

360

×ÖÄ»
Gentlemen, I'm Liz Taylor.

361
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,230
×ÖÄ»
Mr. Drake has sent me here

362
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,232
×ÖÄ»
to lead this company into the future.

363
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,300
×ÖÄ»
Until Mr. Drake has the courtesy

364
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,236
×ÖÄ»
to appear before this board himself...

365
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,438
×ÖÄ»
Mr. Vice-Chairman, I can assure you that Will Drake

366
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,473

has granted me full authority to act on his behalf.

367
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:22,608
×ÖÄ»
Well,

368
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,077
×ÖÄ»
I don't accept your authority.

369
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:26,727
×ÖÄ»
I'm afraid you'll have to.

370
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,084
×ÖÄ»
I've met with Will Drake at the Hotel Cortez,

371
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:33,320
×ÖÄ»
and it's official.

372
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,422
×ÖÄ»
Ms. Taylor here has total authority

373
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,290
×ÖÄ»
to speak on his behalf.

374
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,659
×ÖÄ»
You're fired.

375
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,334
×ÖÄ»
Now, gentlemen, I know something about rebirth.

376
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:51,437
×ÖÄ»
Listen and learn.

377
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,439
×ÖÄ»
No! I can't do this!

378
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:58,845
×ÖÄ»
There's inspiration all around us.

379
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,880
×ÖÄ»
All you got to do is look.

380
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,319
×ÖÄ»
I left Will alone to work his sorcery,

381
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,687
×ÖÄ»
and he left me to mine.

382
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:10,490
×ÖÄ»
â™?Nights in white satin...

383
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,625
×ÖÄ»
We cast his absence as mystery.

384
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,094
×ÖÄ»
He gave very little of himself to the public,

385
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,530
×ÖÄ»
and demand steadily rose.

386
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,600
×ÖÄ»
His presentations were exclusive and exotic.

387
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:24,504
×ÖÄ»
Very few invitations, very unusual models.

388
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,506
×ÖÄ»
All cameras and phones were banned,

389
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,641
×ÖÄ»
which only made word of mouth stronger,

390
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,976
×ÖÄ»
interest more intense.

391
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:35,347
×ÖÄ»
Art deco once again became all the rage.

392
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:38,250
×ÖÄ»
â™?Beauty I'd always missed

393
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:40,519
×ÖÄ»
â™?With these eyes before

394
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:45,023
×ÖÄ»
â™?Just what the truth is...

395
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,059
×ÖÄ»
I should've been jubilant in our success.

396
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:52,029
×ÖÄ»
But instead, I felt lost.

397
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:56,066
×ÖÄ»
â™?'Cause I love you

398
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,735

â™?Yes, I love you...

399
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,273

It was a night like this when I first saw Tristan.

400
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:11,447
×ÖÄ»
Just promise me you'll keep an open mind.

401
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,716
×ÖÄ»
Please, remember to whom you speak.

402
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,152
×ÖÄ»
Now, what are we doing here?

403
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,057
×ÖÄ»
I know how much you miss Tristan.

404
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:23,125
×ÖÄ»
And wherever he is, I don't know

405
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,795
×ÖÄ»
why we haven't seen hide nor hair of him.

406
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:28,798
×ÖÄ»
And if anybody can reach him,

407
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:30,833
×ÖÄ»
this woman can.

408
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:33,769
×ÖÄ»
Iris...

409
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:36,306
×ÖÄ»
did you get me a psychic?

410
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:42,978
×ÖÄ»
Oh.

411
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:49,018
×ÖÄ»
Billie Dean Howard, this is Liz.

412
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,486
×ÖÄ»
Liz, it is so good to meet you.

413
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,989

I've seen you on the side of a bus.

414
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,126
×ÖÄ»
Billie Dean has her own show on Lifetime.

415
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,161

She helps the bereaved communicate with

their dearly departed loved ones.

417
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:02,396
×ÖÄ»
I'm impressed.

418
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,765
×ÖÄ»
I'll be honest.

419
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,466
×ÖÄ»
Your establishment is fairly notorious

420
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,837
×ÖÄ»
among the paranormal communities being a bit of a hot spot.

421
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,239
×ÖÄ»
I was thinking I might want

422
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,941
×ÖÄ»
to do an episode of my show here.

423
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:14,675

But today,

I am here for you.

Hmm.

00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,334
×ÖÄ»
Hmm, so many voices.

427
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,370

It's a very noisy hotel.

428

×ÖÄ»
Oh, I feel something.

429
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,623

A very masculine energy.

430
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,659

Restless.

Tristan, I'm here with Liz.

439
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,456
×ÖÄ»
She misses you very much.

440
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,493
×ÖÄ»
Is there any message you have for her?

441
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,199
×ÖÄ»
What?

442
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,801
×ÖÄ»
What does he say?

443
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,341
×ÖÄ»
He says...

444
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,008
×ÖÄ»
"No."

445
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,777
×ÖÄ»
What do you mean, "No"?

446
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:00,945
×ÖÄ»
What-what no?

447
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,779
×ÖÄ»
He doesn't want to talk.

448
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,781
×ÖÄ»
What do you mean? He's talking to you.

449
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,583
×ÖÄ»
He doesn't want to talk

450
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:09,019
×ÖÄ»
to me.

451
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,955
×ÖÄ»
He's been here all along.

452
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,958
×ÖÄ»
And he's choosing not to talk to me...

453
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,726
×ÖÄ»
'cause he blames me.

454
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,895
×ÖÄ»
I'm the cause of his death.

455
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,964
×ÖÄ»
My love for him killed him.

456
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,765
×ÖÄ»
Love doesn't kill.

457
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,472
×ÖÄ»
I've been around a lot longer, and let me tell you something.

458
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,440
×ÖÄ»
Believe me, love kills a lot more than hate.

459
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,612
×ÖÄ»
Thank you for coming anyway.

460
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,517
×ÖÄ»
Be strong.

461
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:44,653
×ÖÄ»
I know you know how.

462
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:47,323
×ÖÄ»
Yep.

463
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,658
×ÖÄ»
No. This isn't right.

464
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,561
×ÖÄ»
No, wait.

465
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:55,598
×ÖÄ»
Maybe it wasn't Tristan you were talking to.

466
00:23:57,422 --> 00:24:00,869
×ÖÄ»
He remembers the pancakes.

467
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,753
×ÖÄ»
The ones with the blueberries.

468
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,074
×ÖÄ»
You made them for him every Saturday

469
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,976
×ÖÄ»
and let him watch cartoons all morning.

470
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,611
×ÖÄ»
Who's Donovan?

471
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,646
×ÖÄ»
What?

472
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,417
×ÖÄ»
Donovan isn't here.

473
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,085
×ÖÄ»
No, no, no.

474
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,921
×ÖÄ»
Donovan is someplace else.

475
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:22,124
×ÖÄ»
Someplace very beautiful.

476
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,327
×ÖÄ»
He says it smells like pancakes.

477
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,297
×ÖÄ»
Your pancakes.

478
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:33,067
×ÖÄ»
He says it's always Saturday morning where he is.

479
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,571
×ÖÄ»
He says...

480
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,008
×ÖÄ»
"I love you, Mom."

481
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:44,979
×ÖÄ»
Even in my grief, I was happy for my friend.

482
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:48,583
×ÖÄ»
As for me, I felt any chance at love was over.

483
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,919
×ÖÄ»
But life can surprise you.

484
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:53,688
×ÖÄ»
Especially new life.

485
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,159
×ÖÄ»
And love?

486
00:24:58,193 --> 00:25:00,428
×ÖÄ»
Well, that can take many forms.

487
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:03,130
×ÖÄ»
After I made peace with my son Douglas,

488
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,333
×ÖÄ»
I never really expected to see him again.

489
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,369
×ÖÄ»
So I was delighted when he brought Janice to meet me.

490
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:10,972
×ÖÄ»
Janice was the daughter I always wanted.

491
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,307
×ÖÄ»
And I was the mother-in-law she'd always hoped for.

492
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:17,511
×ÖÄ»
In Isabelle's face, I saw the future.

493
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:21,181
×ÖÄ»
She was being born into a world just a little more accepting

494
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,183
×ÖÄ»
than the one I had been born into.

495
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,352
×ÖÄ»
And maybe, just maybe,

496
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:28,321
×ÖÄ»
I had a little something to do with that.

497
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:31,157
×ÖÄ»
A little kindness, acceptance.

498
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:35,662
×ÖÄ»
That transformed me in ways nothing else ever could.

499
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:38,231
×ÖÄ»
I never thought life could be this good.

500
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:43,603
×ÖÄ»
Or that it might end.

501
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,638
×ÖÄ»
Well, shit!

502
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,140
×ÖÄ»
Are you sure?

503
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:48,274
×ÖÄ»
I'm sure.

504
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,609
×ÖÄ»
Well...

505
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:51,478
×ÖÄ»
the doctor is sure.

506
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:53,846
×ÖÄ»
And there ain't nothing they can do about it?

507
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:57,683
×ÖÄ»
It's... past the point of treatment.

508
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:00,720
×ÖÄ»
Which is probably for the best.

509
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:03,723
×ÖÄ»
'Cause...

510
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:05,958
×ÖÄ»
I would hate to lose my hair.

511
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:10,763
×ÖÄ»
Baby girl,

512
00:26:10,797 --> 00:26:13,633
×ÖÄ»
there just might be something that I can do for you.

513
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,267
×ÖÄ»
Huh?

514
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:16,602
×ÖÄ»
What, turn me?

515
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:18,704
×ÖÄ»
Hell, I don't even like my steak bloody.

516
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:20,272
×ÖÄ»
But that's never been an option for me.

517
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,473
×ÖÄ»
You know that.

518
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:24,544
×ÖÄ»
And at this point in my life,

519
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:28,380
×ÖÄ»
I can't imagine killing in order to live.

520
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,670
×ÖÄ»
So have you told your kids yet?

521
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,219
×ÖÄ»
With any luck, I won't need to.

522
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,522
×ÖÄ»
They can just keep visiting me here.

523
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,905
×ÖÄ»
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

524
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,542
×ÖÄ»
I am the first woman in the world to have prostate cancer.

525
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:01,713
×ÖÄ»
Uh, the doctor told me it's spread to the spine

526
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,348
×ÖÄ»
and there's nothing to do.

527
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:11,622
×ÖÄ»
We'll spend whatever we have to.

528
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:14,292
×ÖÄ»
One call and I can get you to the best doctor in the world.

529
00:27:14,326 --> 00:27:15,493
×ÖÄ»
Oh, it's too late.

530
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:18,129
×ÖÄ»
And I don't want to spend

531
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:20,131
×ÖÄ»
my last days wasting away in a hospital

532
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:22,433
×ÖÄ»
with a catheter up my dick and poison in my body,

533
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:24,435
×ÖÄ»
so...

534
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,637
×ÖÄ»
But who will take care of us?

535
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,772
×ÖÄ»
You can't leave us alone. I won't.

536
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:30,941
×ÖÄ»
That's why I called you all here today.

537
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:35,713
×ÖÄ»
Now, I have provided you with various weapons.

538
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:38,315
×ÖÄ»
Take two. They're small.

539
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,550
×ÖÄ»
Uh...

540
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,519
×ÖÄ»
hack me.

541
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:44,554
×ÖÄ»
Strangle me.

542
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,657
×ÖÄ»
Bludgeon me.

543
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:49,660
×ÖÄ»
Surprise me.

544
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:52,529
×ÖÄ»
I think I can speak for everyone here when I say

545
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,964
×ÖÄ»
that we've all grown rather fond of you.

546
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,933
×ÖÄ»
We can't possibly murder you.

547
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,468
×ÖÄ»
It's not murder.

548
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:01,271
×ÖÄ»
She wants to be reborn.

549
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:10,180
×ÖÄ»
You're my family.

550
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,152
×ÖÄ»
I want to be with you forever.

551
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:18,288
×ÖÄ»
â™?The morning sun

552
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,830
×ÖÄ»
â™?Touched lightly on the eyes of Lucy Jordan â™?

553
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:23,659
×ÖÄ»
554 00:28: 00:28:27,563 â™?In a white suburban bedroom

554
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:31,433
×ÖÄ»
â™?In a white suburban town

555
00:28:31,468 --> 00:28:33,309
×ÖÄ»
â™?And she lay there neath the covers â™? 557 00:28: 00:28:39,175 â™?Dreaming of a thousand lovers â™? 558 00:28: 00:28:43,345

556
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,437
×ÖÄ»
â™?Till the world turned to orange â™? 559 00:28: 00:28:49,350 â™?And the room went spinning round â™? 560 00:28: 00:28:54,121 â™?At the age of 37

557
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:55,845
×ÖÄ»
â™?She realized she'd never ride â™? 562 00:28: 00:29:01,429 â™?Through Paris in a sports car â™? 563 00:29: 00:29:07,569 â™?With the warm wind in her hair â™?

558
00:28:55,846 --> 00:28:57,392
×ÖÄ»
564 00:29: 00:29:10,237 â™?So she let the phone keep ringing... â™? 565 00:29: 00:29:14,175 It was the first time I'd seen her since she died.

559
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,911
×ÖÄ»
Only in that moment did I realize

560
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:20,014
×ÖÄ»
just how much I'd missed her.

561
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:22,583
×ÖÄ»
How did you know to come?

562
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:26,787
×ÖÄ»
You were always my fondest creation.

563
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:28,522
×ÖÄ»
â™?He's off to work

564
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:31,359
×ÖÄ»
â™?And the kids are off to school â™? 572 00:29: 00:29:36,730 â™?And there were oh so many ways...

565
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,426
×ÖÄ»
â™? 573 00:29: 00:29:39,465 I wanted to be here to help you transition.

566
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:41,267
×ÖÄ»
â™?For her to spend her day

567
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:43,273
×ÖÄ»
â™?She could clean the house for hours â™?

568
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:45,739
×ÖÄ»
576 00:29: 00:29:48,908 â™?Or rearrange the flowers

569
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:51,204
×ÖÄ»
â™?Or run naked through the shady street...

570
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,412
×ÖÄ»
â™? 578 00:29: 00:29:57,083 One last time.

571
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,020
×ÖÄ»
â™?At the age of 37

572
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:02,639
×ÖÄ»
â™?She realized she'd never ride â™?

573
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,457
×ÖÄ»
581 00:30: 00:30:07,360 â™?Through Paris

574
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:09,161
×ÖÄ»
â™?In a sports car...

575
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:43,829
×ÖÄ»
Those things'll kill you.

576
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:55,740
×ÖÄ»
I don't understand.

577
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,776
×ÖÄ»
You wouldn't talk to me.

578
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,013
×ÖÄ»
I thought you hated me.

579
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:04,048
×ÖÄ»
I love you.

580
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,388
×ÖÄ»
And, darlin',

581
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:12,724
×ÖÄ»
you had more living to do.

582
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:14,759
×ÖÄ»
I couldn't get in the way of that.

583
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:23,301
×ÖÄ»
Oh, baby...

584
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:25,637
×ÖÄ»
you are to die for.

585
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:37,328
×ÖÄ»
- May I help you? - I have a reservation.

586
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:38,648
×ÖÄ»
Room 44.

587
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,284
×ÖÄ»
The Woo room.

588
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,852
×ÖÄ»
That's where Billie Dean says he died.

589
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:43,493
×ÖÄ»
Oh, that room is booked.

590
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,689
×ÖÄ»
Booked by me, three weeks ago.

591
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,457
×ÖÄ»
Under Rhodes, Ashley.

592
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,827
×ÖÄ»
My Amex app says the charge has cleared.

593
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:52,662
×ÖÄ»
You have my money. I want my room.

594
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:55,465
×ÖÄ»
Fine.

595
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,838
×ÖÄ»
It's all my fault.

596
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,973
×ÖÄ»
I thought that Billie'd be free advertising.

597
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,142
×ÖÄ»
You know, people love a good ghost story.

598
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,845
×ÖÄ»
Well, you were right about that.

599
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,513
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, but this is getting way out of hand.

600
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:14,317
×ÖÄ»
She's had three prime-time specials.

601
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,618
×ÖÄ»
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

602
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:18,687
×ÖÄ»
Wait, he's trying to tell me something.

603
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,802
×ÖÄ»
Mr. Woo doesn't pay for what?

604
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,398
×ÖÄ»
I mean, don't get me wrong.

605
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:29,065
×ÖÄ»
I don't mind having this place alive with guests.

606
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,368
×ÖÄ»
It's just those freaks and weirdos

607
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,270
×ÖÄ»
who want to be plowed by a ghost.

608
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:35,209
×ÖÄ»
The people Billie attracts, they're just...

609
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,809
×ÖÄ»
It's bad for our brand.

610
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,437
×ÖÄ»
Why don't we just shut the place down?

611
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,939
×ÖÄ»
Will Drake doesn't need the money anymore.

612
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,242
×ÖÄ»
'Cause this place needs life.

613
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,577
×ÖÄ»
It's a hotel, not a cemetery.

614
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:48,679
×ÖÄ»
The living give the spirits trapped in this place

615
00:32:48,714 --> 00:32:50,581
×ÖÄ»
a connection to the outside world.

616
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:52,149
×ÖÄ»
John.

617
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,852
×ÖÄ»
I was wondering when you were gonna arrive.

618
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,420
×ÖÄ»
We've missed you.

619
00:32:56,913 --> 00:32:59,750
×ÖÄ»
It's good to be back. And you're right.

620
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:01,804
×ÖÄ»
I don't like her coming around.

621
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,772
×ÖÄ»
Pestering, asking questions.

622
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,290
×ÖÄ»
She still trying to contact me?

623
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,910
×ÖÄ»
Every year on this date.

624
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,481
×ÖÄ»
John Lowe.

625
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:14,217
×ÖÄ»
The Ten Commandments Killer.

626
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:17,253
×ÖÄ»
Show yourself and bear witness to your crimes.

627
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,429
×ÖÄ»
Shit.

628
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,897
×ÖÄ»
Call her.

629
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:30,398
×ÖÄ»
Check her into my room.

630
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:31,867
×ÖÄ»
But get her here quickly.

631
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,769
×ÖÄ»
It's only three hours until sundown.

632
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:46,014
×ÖÄ»
We are standing in room 64 of the Hotel Cortez,

633
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:48,683
×ÖÄ»
where the notorious Ten Commandments Killer lived

634
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,285
×ÖÄ»
when he terrorized Los Angeles many years ago.

635
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:55,256
×ÖÄ»
John Lowe may be the most evil and dangerous spirit

636
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,359
×ÖÄ»
with whom I have ever attempted to make contact.

637
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:02,764
×ÖÄ»
I will need all of my skills and powers of concentration

638
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,400
×ÖÄ»
to achieve this unprecedented interview.

639
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,981
×ÖÄ»
You wanted to talk?

640
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:26,620
×ÖÄ»
I want you to talk.

641
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:29,122
×ÖÄ»
My name is Billie Dean Howard.

642
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,811
×ÖÄ»
All we know about John Lowe is what the police have said.

643
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:38,265
×ÖÄ»
I'm giving you a chance now to set the record straight.

644
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:58,217
×ÖÄ»
What do you want to know?

645
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:03,088
×ÖÄ»
Why don't we start with your family.

646
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:04,657
×ÖÄ»
Did they know

647
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,292
×ÖÄ»
you were a serial killer?

648
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:09,554
×ÖÄ»
- What'd you get Holden for dinner? - It's dog again.

649
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:10,860
×ÖÄ»
They came to understand

650
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:12,706
×ÖÄ»
that I was cleaning up the world,

651
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:14,894
×ÖÄ»
- in my own way. - Goddamn it, John.

652
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,857
×ÖÄ»
We talked about this; I was not gonna target people

653
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:18,326
×ÖÄ»
who do not deserve to die.

654
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,127
×ÖÄ»
Now, once you went on the lam,

655
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:23,197
×ÖÄ»
your wife and two children were never seen again.

656
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:24,098
×ÖÄ»
Come on.

657
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,599
×ÖÄ»
- Where are you going? - He's hungry.

658
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:26,767
×ÖÄ»
I know how to walk into a hospital

659
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:27,768
×ÖÄ»
and not get noticed.

660
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:29,670
×ÖÄ»
Did you kill them?

661
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:33,274
×ÖÄ»
I will admit, I failed them.

662
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,286
×ÖÄ»
Daddy?

663
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,156
×ÖÄ»
There's only one thing left to do.

664
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,659
×ÖÄ»
Turn myself in?

665
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,695
×ÖÄ»
We have to go home.

666
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,002
×ÖÄ»
Scarlett was right.

667
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,837
×ÖÄ»
The Cortez was home.

668
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:07,239
×ÖÄ»
We'd all been reborn there, in one form or another.

669
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:09,441
×ÖÄ»
Well, except for her.

670
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:11,443
×ÖÄ»
There was a still a chance for our daughter

671
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:13,379
×ÖÄ»
to grow up somewhere else,

672
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:16,415
×ÖÄ»
to have some shot at a normal life.

673
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,485
×ÖÄ»
But it needed to be away from us.

674
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,453
×ÖÄ»
Liz knew just the place.

675
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,322
×ÖÄ»
The Thatcher School would be host

676
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:27,291
×ÖÄ»
to more than one young refugee from the Hotel Cortez.

677
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:30,428
×ÖÄ»
So you sent your daughter away,

678
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:33,632
×ÖÄ»
but lived with your son and wife in the Cortez,

679
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:37,636
×ÖÄ»
back in L.A., where you were still being hunted.

680
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,039
×ÖÄ»
It's hard to provide for your family when you're on the run.

681
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:45,176
×ÖÄ»
There were more opportunities in Los Angeles.

682
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:27,784
×ÖÄ»
Stop! John Lowe, you're under arrest!

683
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:29,719
×ÖÄ»
I have to make it back to the hotel.

684
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:55,444
×ÖÄ»
Let me...

685
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,924
×ÖÄ»
I want to die inside.

686
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:05,754
×ÖÄ»
I'm sensing something about your wife and son.

687
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:10,695
×ÖÄ»
I can hear the undercurrents from the spirits,

688
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:12,998
×ÖÄ»
but they are too afraid to speak clearly.

689
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,866
×ÖÄ»
Why is that?

690
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,602
×ÖÄ»
I don't want to talk about my family.

691
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:19,504
×ÖÄ»
Well, if you don't want to talk about your family,

692
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:20,905
×ÖÄ»
then give me something else.

693
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,844
×ÖÄ»
What is the significance of October 30?

694
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:29,613
×ÖÄ»
Why is it the only day I feel your presence here?

695
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:34,018
×ÖÄ»
Well, it's Devil's Night.

696
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:37,521
×ÖÄ»
And if you leave your camera crew behind,

697
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:39,556
×ÖÄ»
that I can show you.

698
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,817
×ÖÄ»
They're screaming.

699
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:04,820
×ÖÄ»
I was in a house once just west of here.

700
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:09,591
×ÖÄ»
And I could hear the spirits in the walls like termites...

701
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:13,575
×ÖÄ»
or bats in the attic.

702
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:16,678
×ÖÄ»
But it was nothing like this.

703
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:21,082
×ÖÄ»
This is like being in a rock concert of the dead.

704
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,119
×ÖÄ»
Well, come on.

705
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,055
×ÖÄ»
Let me introduce you to some rock stars of the dead.

706
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:31,660
×ÖÄ»
Oh, Jeffrey, you and your damn straws.

707
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:36,097
×ÖÄ»
Come on. Put your drink down and come and dance with me.

708
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:38,166
×ÖÄ»
I don't dance.

709
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,000
×ÖÄ»
Look at me.

710
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,003
×ÖÄ»
Neither do I.

711
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:45,839
×ÖÄ»
John! Oh!

712
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:48,842
×ÖÄ»
Jeffrey, look who's here.

713
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:50,444
×ÖÄ»
John is here.

714
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:52,879
×ÖÄ»
He's the greatest of them all.

715
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,881
×ÖÄ»
Are you blushing?

716
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:58,485
×ÖÄ»
I told you, if you like a guy, you have to talk to him.

717
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,487
×ÖÄ»
You think any of those young men

718
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:02,888
×ÖÄ»
would have come over to work at my house if I didn't have

719
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,858
×ÖÄ»
the guts to approach them in the world?

720
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:10,162
×ÖÄ»
Well, those guys in Milwaukee must have been pretty desperate

721
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:11,831
×ÖÄ»
to go home with Jeffrey.

722
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:14,500
×ÖÄ»
The guy can't get two words out without going flush.

723
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,971
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God.

724
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:21,006
×ÖÄ»
You're John Wayne Gacy.

725
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:26,278
×ÖÄ»
And that's Jeffrey Dahmer.

726
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:31,350
×ÖÄ»
Are you frightened?

727
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:34,019
×ÖÄ»
Oh, no.

728
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:38,881
×ÖÄ»
No, I just surround myself with the white light of spirit and...

729
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,294
×ÖÄ»
to keep myself protected.

730
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,073
×ÖÄ»
Sure thing, sweetheart.

731
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,632
×ÖÄ»
Yeah! Let's get this party started!

732
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,869
×ÖÄ»
I need a beer. I'll drink whatever's cold.

733
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:53,505
×ÖÄ»
Jesus H. Christ on a horse, what the hell is this shit music?

734
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:55,040
×ÖÄ»
Aileen Wuornos.

735
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:58,642
×ÖÄ»
Richard Ramirez.

736
00:40:58,677 --> 00:41:01,246
×ÖÄ»
I'm married, but we live apart.

737
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:09,087
×ÖÄ»
And that's the Zodiac.

738
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:11,389
×ÖÄ»
I'll get you a drink.

739
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:17,609
×ÖÄ»
â™?I want to hold the hand inside you...

740
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,597
×ÖÄ»
â™? 748 00:41: 00:41:22,600 Uh, hey.

741
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:24,101
×ÖÄ»
I'm Aileen.

742
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:26,870
×ÖÄ»
â™?I want to take a breath...

743
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:30,107
×ÖÄ»
You have the prettiest hair.

744
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:33,643
×ÖÄ»
Man, what I wouldn't do for a head of hair like that.

745
00:41:33,677 --> 00:41:36,146
×ÖÄ»
It's like... it's like Farrah Fawcett.

746
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,016
×ÖÄ»
Reminds me of my-my ex-girlfriend.

747
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,019
×ÖÄ»
Oh, I feel ill.

748
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:43,920
×ÖÄ»
All these dark spirits.

749
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:46,923
×ÖÄ»
It's... it's a little overwhelming.

750
00:41:46,957 --> 00:41:49,926
×ÖÄ»
Just drink that. It'll relax you.

751
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,718
×ÖÄ»
Absinthe!

752
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:54,580
×ÖÄ»
Our customary libation.

753
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,739
×ÖÄ»
James Patrick March.

754
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:06,242
×ÖÄ»
Oh.

755
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:08,677
×ÖÄ»
Oh, I feel the violence in you.

756
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:14,616
×ÖÄ»
So many spirits who you snuffed out.

757
00:42:16,748 --> 00:42:21,022
×ÖÄ»
I can see all the moments when they crossed over.

758
00:42:21,057 --> 00:42:23,492
×ÖÄ»
Tell me,

759
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:25,293
×ÖÄ»
what is that like?

760
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:28,296
×ÖÄ»
Is it a moving picture, like so many cells on a film reel?

761
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:31,032
×ÖÄ»
Or more like a kaleidoscope of human suffering?

762
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,159
×ÖÄ»
It's not a picture.

763
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:35,434
×ÖÄ»
It's a feeling.

764
00:42:36,296 --> 00:42:40,240
×ÖÄ»
Like a mist on your face on a cold morning.

765
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:45,980
×ÖÄ»
You can't see it in the air, but you can feel...

766
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:47,782
×ÖÄ»
the wetness.

767
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,784
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. I can feel the wetness

768
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,019
×ÖÄ»
with you so close to me right now, Johnny boy.

769
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:05,499
×ÖÄ»
I got a seat right next to me.

770
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,037
×ÖÄ»
So this is Devil's Night.

771
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,481
×ÖÄ»
My Murderers' Row!

772
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,147
×ÖÄ»
How odd it must be to see all of us then

773
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,486
×ÖÄ»
in what appears to be the flesh.

774
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,022
×ÖÄ»
Flesh enough to eat,

775
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:30,891
×ÖÄ»
drink,

776
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:33,660
×ÖÄ»
feel our grip on your arm,

777
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,762
×ÖÄ»
our breath on your skin.

778
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:38,365
×ÖÄ»
No!

779
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:44,204
×ÖÄ»
How's that white light holding up, Billie Dean?

780
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:46,473
×ÖÄ»
I don't want to be here anymore.

781
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:48,876
×ÖÄ»
When does the party favor arrive?

782
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,911
×ÖÄ»
John's taken care of that.

783
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:52,346
×ÖÄ»
Grab your weapons,

784
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,846
×ÖÄ»
ladies and gents.

785
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:56,182
×ÖÄ»
No.

786
00:43:58,047 --> 00:43:59,847
×ÖÄ»
No.

787
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:03,089
×ÖÄ»
Can't throw a killer party without a little killing, right?

788
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:05,925
×ÖÄ»
Don't worry, Billie.

789
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:08,261
×ÖÄ»
I think you're gonna like living here.

790
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:10,096
×ÖÄ»
Here's the deal.

791
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,598
×ÖÄ»
No more specials or interviews

792
00:44:12,632 --> 00:44:15,154
×ÖÄ»
or books or tweets or casual conversations

793
00:44:15,274 --> 00:44:17,103
×ÖÄ»
at cocktail parties with Shirley MacLaine

794
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:18,637
×ÖÄ»
about this hotel.

795
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:20,639
×ÖÄ»
This place is dead to you.

796
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:22,141
×ÖÄ»
We will become a myth,

797
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,943
×ÖÄ»
which is what we should've been left to do anyway.

798
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:26,378
×ÖÄ»
What if I don't?

799
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:28,113
×ÖÄ»
One sure-as-shit thing I can tell you

800
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:31,383
×ÖÄ»
about being murdered: it hurts.

801
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:34,752
×ÖÄ»
And we like to make it last...

802
00:44:35,986 --> 00:44:38,866
×ÖÄ»
None of you can leave the hotel, so...

803
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:43,765
×ÖÄ»
you can't hold me to my word, huh?

804
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:46,597
×ÖÄ»
But I can.

805
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:51,636
×ÖÄ»
What the hell are you?

806
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,472
×ÖÄ»
You're not dead.

807
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:55,974
×ÖÄ»
I'm a creature

808
00:44:56,008 --> 00:44:58,609
×ÖÄ»
who kills to live

809
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:01,245
×ÖÄ»
and who drinks a body's worth of blood a day

810
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:02,712
×ÖÄ»
and doesn't think twice about

811
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:05,549
×ÖÄ»
who I'm sucking it from.

812
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,252
×ÖÄ»
So, if you even let out a whisper of a word

813
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,987
×ÖÄ»
that sounds like "Cortez,"

814
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:13,991
×ÖÄ»
I'll find you and drain every drop of life

815
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:16,660
×ÖÄ»
from your skinny ass.

816
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,495
×ÖÄ»
I can't be the only one here

817
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:20,130
×ÖÄ»
hoping you say no.

818
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:21,698
×ÖÄ»
No!

819
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:26,136
×ÖÄ»
No! No!

820
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:03,607
×ÖÄ»
Did you take care of what you had to take care of?

821
00:46:03,641 --> 00:46:04,674
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

822
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:07,110
×ÖÄ»
Look at you, Scarlett.

823
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:08,845
×ÖÄ»
Where'd my little girl go?

824
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,346
×ÖÄ»
You're just saying that 'cause

825
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:12,548
×ÖÄ»
I'm the only member of the family that ages.

826
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:16,552
×ÖÄ»
Thanks for coming.

827
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:18,954
×ÖÄ»
Tonight means a lot to me.

828
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:20,390
×ÖÄ»
For us

829
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:22,158
×ÖÄ»
all to be together.

830
00:46:22,192 --> 00:46:24,127
×ÖÄ»
Even just for a few hours.

831
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,995
×ÖÄ»
Of course, Dad.

832
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,398
×ÖÄ»
Means a lot to me, too.

833
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:31,000
×ÖÄ»
Go on.

834
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,003
×ÖÄ»
Get into bed with them.

835
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,838
×ÖÄ»
Not you?

836
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:37,073
×ÖÄ»
I'm getting a little big

837
00:46:37,107 --> 00:46:38,874
×ÖÄ»
for the family bed.

838
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:40,910
×ÖÄ»
I'll take the chair.

839
00:46:51,387 --> 00:46:53,488
×ÖÄ»
I'm afraid to fall asleep.

840
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:56,858
×ÖÄ»
As soon as I close my eyes,

841
00:46:56,892 --> 00:46:59,894
×ÖÄ»
it'll all be gone for another year.

842
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:02,364
×ÖÄ»
It's okay, Daddy.

843
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,101
×ÖÄ»
Rest.

844
00:48:20,852 --> 00:48:23,369
×ÖÄ»
What brings you to the Cortez?

845
00:48:24,345 --> 00:48:26,312
×ÖÄ»
Tomorrow's Halloween.

846
00:48:26,347 --> 00:48:29,081
×ÖÄ»
This place is supposed to be haunted, right?

847
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:31,984
×ÖÄ»
I'm meeting some friends here.

848
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:33,719
×ÖÄ»
No, you're not.

849

No.

You have a jawline for days.
