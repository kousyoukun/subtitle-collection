1
00:00:01,341 --> 00:00:03,976
刚开始我们寄予了厚望
We started with such high hopes.

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:06,278
因为前几任老板都死了
With all the previous owners being dead,

3
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:10,115
旅馆现在由我们管理了
the hotel was under new management... ours.

4
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:12,417
我们决定按照我们的想法
We were determined to remake the Cortez

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,619
改造Cortez
in our own image.

6
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,754
这里不仅仅是家旅馆
This would be no mere hotel.

7
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,590
我们本想成为无依无靠者的家人
We had ambitions to be a family to the friendless,

8
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,759
给遭受冷落的人带去安慰
a comfort to those in the cold,

9
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:25,096
建造一个包容的蜂巢
a beehive of acceptance.

10
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:29,260
本该是个完美的结局
It was supposed to be the perfect ending.

11
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,057
- 你们好 - 你好
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

12
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,159
欢迎下榻Cortez
Welcome to the Cortez.

13
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,293
请在宾客登记簿上签名
Please, sign our guest book.

14
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,762
好的
Sure.

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,930
你们要来杯香槟吗
May I offer the two of you a glass of champagne?

16
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,331
行啊
Don't mind if I do.

18
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,603
我觉得他们是"冒险旅行家"网站
I think those are the reviewers

19
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,006
来的评论人 
from that Internet site, Trip Adventurers.

20
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,375
他们定是听说我们旅馆盛大重开的消息了
They must've heard about our grand reopening.

21
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,943
我知道
I know.

22
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,379
没看到我这满脸堆积着
Can't you see the ridiculously gracious smile

23
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,314
亲切地有些荒唐的微笑吗
plastered on my face?

24
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:11,719
这股刺激气味是怎么回事
What is that pungent odor?

25
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,755
是鼠尾草 用来净化灵魂的
Sage. To cleanse the spirit.

26
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,124
我带你们去房间
I'll show you to your room.

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,095
给Cortez这块宝石润色
To polish the jewel that is the Cortez,

28
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,964
不仅需要钱 这个我们从卖掉女伯爵
it required not only money... which we got from liquidating

29
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,767
那无数艺术品得到了
the Countess's numerous pieces of art...

30
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:30,137
不过还得在网上得到四星好评才行
it was going to take four stars on the Internet.

31
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,972
于是 我们说干就干
And so, we were off.

32
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:40,611
我们还没完成每层楼的装修 但这间是
We haven't finished with every floor, but this is one of

33
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:43,049
新装修的其中之一
our newly refreshed rooms.

34
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,205
埃及棉
Egyptian cotton.

35
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,552
四百线程的
400 thread count.

36
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:46,482
还有小酒吧
Minibar?

37
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,432
混合酒免费
Mixers are on the house.

38
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:50,357
如果还有其他需要
If there's anything else you need,

39
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,858
打电话就行
just pick up the phone.

40
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:52,904
谢谢
Thank you.

41
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:54,542
住得开心
Enjoy your stay.

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,062
你之前还想给个勉强及格
And you were ready to give it a pass.

43
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:01,100
咬我啊
Kill me.

44
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:04,970
逗我的吧
Are you kidding?

45
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,734
这可是东陶牌的双抽水马桶啊 亲
That's a Toto Neorest 700H, baby.

46
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,808
日本产的自动清洗神奇马桶
The Japanese self-cleaning wonder toilet.

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,080
我一直想试下这些东西呢
I have always wanted to try one of these.

49
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,271
这马桶没让你想拉一泡吗
Doesn't it just make you want to take a dump?

50
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,818
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

51
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,320
怎么进来的
How did you get in here?

52
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:27,359
不得不说 房间不错
I got to say, it's a nice room.

53
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:31,670
他们花了血本 把能换的都换了
They spent every penny they had to change everything they could.

54
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,083
把床垫 特别是那些我划破的
They took out the mattresses,

55
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:35,834
给换了 
especially the ones I split open.

56
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,903
还有那些浸泡在尿和血中
Took out the carpets,

57
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:41,740
多年的地毯
soaked through with so many years

58
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,209
也给换了
of piss and blood.

59
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,113
甚至家具都换了
They even changed the furniture.

60
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,016
但你们知道他们换不了的是什么吗
But you know what they couldn't take out?

61
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,653
是痛苦
The pain.

62
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:58,156
因为我还在这
'Cause I'm still here.

63
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,924
行了 我要请你离开
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

64
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,159
现在就走
Now. 

65
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,560
天啊 
Oh! God!

66
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,432
天啊
Oh, God! Oh, God!

67
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,702
快报警
Call the police!

68
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:13,738
有个疯婆子刚杀了我的搭档
Some crazy bitch just killed my partner!

69
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:14,772
求...
Please... ah!

70
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,574
天啊
Oh, my God. Oh!

71
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:17,942
天啊
Oh, God.

72
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,911
请你帮帮我
Please, you got to help me!

73
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:22,614
不 是你得帮我
No, no. You have to help me.

74
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,248
我是这杀人游戏中的新手呢
I'm new at this murder game,

75
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:26,751
天啊 太刺激了
and, Jesus Christ, is it a thrill.

76
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,996
对了
Ah, crap.

77
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,098
走廊尽头还有一个
We got another one down at the end of the hallway.

78
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,432
该死
Damn it.

79
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,167
不能再继续了
This has got to stop.

80
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,869
新地毯被他污染了
He stained the new carpet.

81
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,838
是啊 我们麻烦大了
Yeah, we got a serious problem.

82
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,706
鬼一直在杀客人
The ghosts keep killing the guests,

83
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,042
这样下去一星都休想得到
we're gonna end up with zero stars.

84
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:57,313
是时候开个会了
It's time we had a goddamn meeting.

86
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:09,315
大家好 欢迎
Hello! Welcome!

87
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:12,449
- 感谢你们出席 - 打扰一下
- Thank you all for coming. - Excuse me.

88
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,817
据我所知 现在是你俩管事了吧
My understanding is that you two are in charge now,

89
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:17,353
我想跟你谈谈换房间的事
and I'd like to speak to you about changing my room.

90
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,522
亲爱的 你都是鬼了
Sweetheart, you're a ghost.

91
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:21,628
想住哪间 就住哪间
You can choose whatever room you'd like.

92
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,490
没错 但问题是
Well, yes, but the problem is,

93
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,014
我挑好房间
after I pick a room

94
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,683
把我的色情小说搬进去后
and then settle in with my erotica novels,

95
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,685
我哪知道什么时候会有客人住进来
I never know if a guest is going to check in

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,320
打扰我
and disturb me.

97
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,256
我知道这里是洛杉矶
I know this is Los Angeles,

98
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,691
但我是个保守的姑娘 喜欢隐私
but I'm an old-fashioned girl and I like my privacy.

99
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:37,693
我觉得客人来的时候
I dig it when the guests come in.

100
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,195
就像一场免费黄片
It's like a free dirty movie.

101
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,462
我喜欢素人的自拍作品
I'm into that amateur stuff.

102
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,198
你们仨 玩真的了么
Are you three, like, a thing now?

103
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,266
对啊
Ya.

104
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,301
我们想泡伐木工
We try dating the lumberjack,

105
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,719
但他是同性恋
but he's a gay.

106
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,972
好了 大家 请听我说
Okay, everyone, please, listen.

107
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,240
事关紧要
This is important,

108
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,708
会影响你们每个人
and it affects every single one of you.

109
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,779
我们希望你们别再杀客人了
We would like you to stop killing the guests.

110
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,148
也不是你们所有人
It's not all of you,

111
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:00,816
我们想
but we are trying

112
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,251
在这建造些特别的东西
to build something special here.

113
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:05,086
一个真正的终点
A real... destination.

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,954
Carson要来两支橄榄球队
Look, they're gonna get two football teams down in Carson.

115
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,923
顺着110公路就二十分钟的路
That's 20 minutes down the 110.

116
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,591
这里或许能客满
This place could be filled.

117
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,260
但要是走漏了风声 来这住的人
But if it gets out that people are

118
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:14,928
会消失不见
checking in and disappearing,

119
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,326
这样明显不利于生意
then obviously, that's bad for business.

120
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,999
得了吧 Iris
Screw you, Iris.

121
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,668
你才是杀人最多的刽子手
You're the biggest killer in this room,

122
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:23,369
- 你这嗜血的恶魔 - 那是以前的我
- you bloodsucker. - Maybe in the past.

123
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:27,114
我现在喝得每一滴血都是捐赠得来的
But every drop of blood I drink now is donated.

124
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:29,810
这旅馆里被杀的人
Any murders that go on in this hotel

125
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:32,121
都是你们这类人干的
are done by your kind.

126
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,813
打断一下
Excuse me, but...

127
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,714
你说"我们这类人"是什么意思
what do you mean by "Our kind"?

128
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,382
别拐弯抹角了
Can we all just call

129
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:40,519
直说Will和我不就得了
a spade a spade and say you're talking about Will and I?

130
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:43,436
Woo忙着
I mean, Woo is

131
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,324
泡瑞典妞
too busy munching on Swedish fish

132
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:46,302
没空打扰他人
to bother anyone.

133
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,427
Marcy整天不是调戏自己
Marcy molests herself

134
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,895
就是抱怨个不停
or complains all day.

135
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,563
伐木工嘛 一副百无聊赖的样子
The lumberjack just mopes.

136
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,933
还有那对时髦情侣 游来荡去
And that hipster couple just trips around

137
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,801
整天因为甘蓝发牢骚
moaning about for kale.

138
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:58,570
只有Will和我
Will and I are the only ones

139
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,740
还在搞恶作剧寻找刺激
who still get off on a little bit of true mischief.

140
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,007
我们不会罢手的
And we're not stopping.

141
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,976
干掉一个
Ending some jerk-off

142
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,212
浪费空气的蠢货
who wastes the air that he breathes?

143
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:09,648
才是真正的乐趣
That is the real high.

144
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:12,551
我虽已死 但从没活得如此真实
I'm dead, but I've never felt more alive.

146
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:18,690
说得好
Beautifully said.

147
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,425
我完全同意
And I couldn't agree more.

148
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,927
但这件事上 我必须站在Cleopatra和
But I must come down on the side of Cleopatra

149
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,996
她朋友这边
and her friend on this issue.

150
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,364
算了吧
Oh, come on!

151
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,399
你跟我们说停止杀人
You telling people to stop killing

152
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,469
就像桑德斯上校告诉我们别吃鸡一样
is like Colonel Sanders telling us to stop eating chicken.

153
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,143
我不是很熟悉你的军人朋友
I'm not familiar with your military friend

154
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,480
和他对家禽的喜爱
and his fondness for poultry,

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,640
但我要停止杀戮了
but my killing days are over.

156
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:37,942
我以为十宗罪杀人
I thought the Ten Commandment killings

157
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,377
是我作品的开始
were the beginning of my work,

158
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,312
但事实证明是尾声
but it turns out that they are the epilogue.

159
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:45,516
后继有人 而我感到了圆满 
The torch has been passed, and I feel complete.

160
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:48,992
这是明智的决定 而不是感性的抉择
But this is a practical decision, not an emotional one.

161
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,823
这是我们的家
This is our home.

162
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,058
坦白说 这是我们唯一的东西了
Frankly, it's the only one we've got.

163
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,994
如果没了这里 没人知道在这
None of us know what is waiting for us

164
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,296
以外的世界有什么等着我们 
beyond this place if it no longer stands.

165
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,099
或许 没有这些墙的保护 我们会被
Perhaps, without these walls to protect us, we would all be

166
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,701
逼着去面对
forced to move on and face

167
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,423
造物主的审判
the judgment of our Maker.

168
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,205
如果我们不能维持生意 那就没赌注了
If we can't stay in business, all bets are off.

169
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,273
我们必须要出售
We'll have to sell.

170
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:10,608
或被驱逐
Or get evicted.

171
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:11,876
放屁
That's bullshit.

172
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,443
我为这里出了钱
I paid cash for this place.

173
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,545
我的律师会一直付保养费和税
My lawyers will keep paying the upkeep and the taxes

174
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,958
只要他们还有基金
for as long as they have the funds.

175
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:19,783
是啊 但不会维持太久 牛仔
Yeah, well, that's not gonna take very long, cowboy.

176
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,885
当然 你的生意值不少钱
Sure, your business was worth a fortune

177
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,287
在你活着的时候
when you were alive.

178
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,122
但你太自恋了
But you're such a narcissist

179
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,158
从未让别人插手过你的设计
that you never brought anyone else in to design your lines.

180
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:31,128
当你消失了 他们啥都没了
And when you disappeared, they had zilch.

181
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,630
现在一切都没了
Now the whole shithouse has gone up in flames.

182
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,698
你的股票一文不值了
Your stock is worth pennies.

183
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,967
你胡说
That is bullshit!

184
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,201
你个大骗子
You're a goddamn liar.

185
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:39,868
够了 这不是民主辩论
Enough! This is not a democracy!

186
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,137
我们不是在上议院
We are not in the House of Lords!

187
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,704
我们是一条船上的蚂蚱
We are a ship at sea!

188
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,341
说到你们这些幽灵 我才是队长
And when it comes to you spirits, I am captain!

189
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,643
听着 伙计们
So listen up, mateys!

190
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,645
美国内政部
There are six criteria

191
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,847
有六个准则
that the U.S. Department of Interior uses to determine

192
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,682
去判定一个地方是否值得
if a place is worthy of being called

193
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,451
称为历史地标
an historical landmark.

194
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,486
这个酒店符合那些标准
This hotel fits them all.

195
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,789
只有一项还未达成的是时间
The one thing it does not yet possess is time.

196
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,266
年代
Age.

197
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:05,361
2026年八月二十三日
August 23, 2026.

198
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,996
这所酒店就有一百年的历史了
That will make it 100 years that this hotel has stood.

199
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,797
到那天 它就会赢得应有的荣誉
And on that day, it will earn its rightful distinction

200
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,500
一个历史地标建筑
as an historical landmark.

201
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,336
他们就没法再拆掉这了
They won't be able to tear it down

202
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,837
就算他们想拆
even if they wanted to.

203
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,474
杀戮必须停止
The killing must stop!

204
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,676
该死的不
Oh, hell no.

205
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,945
我们中的一些人没法去
Some of us can't go out into the world

206
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,447
外面找同伴
to find companionship,

207
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,349
我不会停止收集灵魂
so I'm not gonna stop collecting souls

208
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,050
- 直到找到我的精神伴侣 - Sally 我不想
- until I find my soul mate. - Sally, I don't want

209
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,986
凶你 但你和我都明白
to get rough with you, but you and I both know

210
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,553
有让你去找伴侣的方法
there is a way to get you to do as I please.

211
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,655
还是 你不记得上次你不听我话的事了
Or do you not recall the last time you disobeyed me?

212
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,561
那就这么定了
So, it's settled, then.

213
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:49,103
死去的要点不就是没规则吗
The point of being dead is that there are no rules.

214
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,071
那是唯一的救赎
It's the only salvation.

215
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,340
谁在乎他们要拆掉这地方
Who gives a shit if they tear this place down

216
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,442
直接送我们下地狱
and send us all straight to hell?

217
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:58,012
还有什么更糟糕的事吗
It can't be any worse!

218
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,159
滚开
Go away!

219
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,397
一瓶赠送给我们
Complimentary bottle of champagne

220
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,400
永久贵宾居民的香槟
for our VIP long-term residents.

221
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:22,106
就是你 小姐
That's you, missy.

222
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:24,102
你省省吧
Save your breath.

223
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,004
我懂你的意思
I know what you're up to.

224
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,507
你的圣歌计谋 或许对别人有用
Your Kumbaya intrigues might work with the others;

225
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,142
但我不吃你这套
they're not gonna work with me.

226
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,143
很好
Good.

227
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:33,145
我们废话少说
We can cut the crap.

228
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,613
老天 你真是个孤独 悲惨的婊子
Jesus, you're one lonely, miserable bitch.

229
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:38,983
这才是你啊
Oh, there she is.

230
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,153
现在滚出我的房间
Now get the hell out of my room.

231
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,922
你这么苦大仇深的不累吗
Don't you ever get tired of being so goddamn bitter?

232
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,782
我想帮助你 Sally
I want to help you, Sally.

233
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,693
这话是推我坠楼的女人说的
This coming from the woman who shoved me out of a window.

234
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:49,694
好吧
Okay.

235
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,496
那事怪我
That's on me.

236
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,832
对不起
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,668
真的
Truly.

238
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:59,953
但 我们都不该沉浸在过去里
But it's no good for either of us to dwell in the past.

239
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,190
说实话 自从John走了 你就变了
Honey, you haven't been the same since John left.

240
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,078
当心啊 Iris
Watch it, Iris.

241
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:10,514
我还是可以把冰锥插入你的喉咙 任何时候
I can still take an ice pick to your throat, anytime.

242
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,226
你爱他
You loved him.

243
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,362
用你唯一知道的方式
The only way you knew how.

244
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,898
但他背弃了你
He turned his back on you,

245
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,302
在你为他做那么多之后
after all you'd done for him.

246
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,258
我懂那种感觉
I know how that feels.

247
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:38,008
你他妈一点也不知道我的感受
You don't know a damn thing about how I feel.

248
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,344
我的痛苦
About my pain.

249
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,739
唯一能消除烦恼的是
The only thing that takes the edge off

250
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,064
当我拉着人和我一起
is when I can pull people under with me.

251
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:53,256
让他们感受一盎司我的感受
Make them feel one ounce of what I feel.

252
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,891
之后我就不孤独了
Then I'm not alone.

253
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,194
但你看到了吗
But don't you see?

254
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:01,897
那些被你杀掉的人
All those people you've been killing, it's...

255
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:04,033
他们只是创口贴
they're just Band-Aids.

256
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:08,204
我还知道一个永久修复的方法
What if I knew of a more permanent fix?

257
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,806
你可以有长效的东西
You could have something long-lasting.

258
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,809
一个未来
A future.

259
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:16,312
什么未来
What future?

260
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:17,913
我死啦
I'm dead.

261
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:20,549
你生活在1994年的世界里
You've been living in a 1994 world.

262
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,351
时代变了
Times have changed.

263
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:27,541
Cortez自豪的向每个房间提供免费网络
The Cortez is proud to offer free Wi-Fi now in every room.

264
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:34,730
这是你去冒险的票子
Here's your ticket to adventure.

265
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,269
快点 打开它
Go on, open it.

266
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,474
我能用这个干嘛
What am I supposed to do with this?

267
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,242
我们无法改变过去
We can't change the past,

268
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:49,903
但你可以选择向前看 生活下去
but you can choose to move forward and live.

269
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:50,812
那又如何
So what?

270
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:52,814
我要变成机器里的鬼魂吗
I-I'm gonna be the ghost in the machine?

271
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:55,717
这正是你要做的
That's exactly what you're gonna be.

272
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,719
好了 看
Okay, look.

273
00:12:57,753 --> 00:13:00,689
我帮你安装了
I loaded it up for you

274
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:04,426
推特 图享
with Twitter, Instagram,

275
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,694
脸书 你不用出门
Facebook. You don't need to be

276
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,762
也可以成为世界的一部分
out in the world to be a part of it.

277
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:10,899
在现代社会 没人会孤独
In the modern age, no one ever has to be alone.

278
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,867
一秒钟都不会
Even for a second.

279
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:17,105
全世界都在等你拥抱它呢 Sally
There's a whole world out there waiting to embrace you, Sally.

280
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:20,141
快点 你只需要沉浸在其中
Come on, all you have to do is dive in.

281
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,818
Sally离不开互联网了 就像水里的鱼
Sally took to the interwebs like a fish to water.

282
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:34,488
她做任何事
It was as if everything she did

283
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,423
只要拍出来
shot out a pulse of electricity.

284
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,410
世界的各个角落
And from all the corners of the globe,

285
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,077
人们都会回复
people responded.

286
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,882
陆陆续续 还要更多
In droves, tingling for more.

287
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:48,547
被吸引的观众打开双臂欢迎她
A rapt audience welcoming her with open arms,

288
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,023
急切的关注 等待她的每个字
desperate to connect, hanging onto her every word.

289
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:56,027
突然灰姑娘变成了白天鹅
Suddenly the girl no one wanted became the belle of the ball.

290
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:58,395
她可以说任何事 释放她的灵魂
She could say anything, bare her soul.

291
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:02,166
她孤独的声音 编织成了网络亚文化
Her lone voice weaving into its own cyber subculture.

292
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:05,169
安全的港湾
A safe harbor.

293
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:08,822
# 当你渴望 那就倾诉 #
It spits you out when you desire

294
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,173
# 征服 让你感到更高 #
Conquer...  it to feel you're higher... 

295 
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:13,748
在她沉醉在无限的崇拜中时
As she basked in sublime adoration,

295
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,748
对世界的麻木最终失去了吸引力
being numb to the world finally lost its appeal.

296
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,969
再一杯吗
Another?

297
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,908
我死了多久了
How long have I been dead?

298
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,910
一年多了吧
It's over a year now.

299
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,845
你觉得有多长呢
How long does it feel like?

300
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,846
向我没存在过一样
Like I don't exist.

301
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:57,786
所以你才开始因发泄而杀人吗
Is that why you've been acting out and killing those people?

302
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,356
我不知道我的公司倒闭了
I had no idea that my business was dead.

303
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:04,760
还没倒闭 不过也快了
Oh, it's not dead. It's dying.

304
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,423
他们准备怎么处置
Well, what have they done with it?

305
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,430
改成工厂吗
Factories?

306
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:11,344
第五大道上的精品商店吗
The stores on Rodeo, Fifth Avenue?

307
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:14,157
他们把时装部给关了
Well, they shuttered the couture division.

308
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:18,672
留着香水部和太阳镜部来维持运营
The perfumes and sunglasses are keeping everything else afloat.

309
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,733
你确实对这个世界很重要 知道吗
And you do matter in the world, you know.

310
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:26,047
只要事业在发展 你的儿子还茁壮成长着 你就不会被遗忘
As long as it lives and your son thrives, you matter.

311
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,862
我很感激你为他所做的一切
I'm grateful for what you've done for him.

312
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,668
撒切尔中学是我国最好的学校之一
Thatcher is one of the best schools in the country,

313
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:35,847
奥海镇一年四季气候宜人
and Ojai is year-round divine.

314
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:37,552
你该让他回来见见你的
You should let him come and visit you.

315
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:40,561
不了 不了
No. No.

316
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,667
这里不是年轻人该来的地方
This is no place for a young man.

317
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,911
这里到处弥漫着死亡的气息
All of the death here.

318
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,987
我不想他的纯真被这里污染
I don't want him to be poisoned by it.

319
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,889
就算无法见到他 我会有多心痛
Even if it breaks my heart that I can't see him.

320
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,726
我给你个建议吧
May I make a proposition?

321
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,895
你很美 但你不是我喜欢的类型
You're beautiful, but you're not my type.

322
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,968
没有经历过那种刻骨铭心的痛
The trapped spirits in this place

323
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,705
却受困于这里的鬼魂们 他们懂得
who aren't in perpetual misery understand that

324
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,708
如果你想要感受魔法的原理和功效
if you want to feel the magic of cause and effect,

325
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,442
你必须得要有个目标
you have to have a purpose.

326
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,579
你的时装店很出色
Your fashion house was iconic.

327
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,548
你也很出色
You're iconic.

328
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,249
早在在我"消失"之前
My fashion house was headed for disaster

329
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,223
我的时装店就已经经营惨淡了
long before I "Disappeared."

330
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,588
十年来我都没想到过一个原创的理念
I haven't had an original thought in a decade.

331
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,450
这里可是加利福尼亚啊
This is California!

332
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,359
涅重生之地啊
The land of reinvention.

333
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,760
我是说
I mean,

334
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,163
看看这里成就了怎样的我
look what this place did for me.

335
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,133
人们会认为我去了哪里呢
Where does everyone even think I am?

336
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,569
谣言比比皆是
Rumors abound.

337
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,573
去了戒毒所 精神病院 大病一场
Rehab, madness, illness.

338
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,075
只有过之 而无不及
Each one more scandalous than the last.

339
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,679
坦白说 流言蜚语就是这样
Frankly, it's marvelous publicity.

340
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,647
人们热衷于神秘的事物
People love a mystery.

341
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,685
构思吧
Sketch.

342
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,453
定个计划
Create.

343
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,455
再次融入进这个世界吧
Be part of the world again.

344
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:10,393
经营时装店可不止是画个草图这么简单
Running a fashion house is more than sketching.

345
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:13,964
比其他任何生意都难做 我需要模特
More than any other business, a line needs a face.

346
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,373
好吧
Okay.

347
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:27,576
没死之前 我做过售货员
I was a salesman in another life.

348
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,678
而现在 我就是时尚之母
In this one, I'm the mother of style.

349
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,547
我流的血都是迪奥的
Cut me and I bleed Dior.

350
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,087
你不是非要死的
And you don't have to be dead, you know.

351
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,522
所以你决定躲在你的安乐窝
So you decided to hole up in your happy place,

352
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,591
就像亿万富豪霍华德・休斯那样无忧无虑
like Howard Hughes without the crazy.

353
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,393
我们可以做到的
We can do this!

354
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,905
踩着一双五英寸的古驰
Stepping into the boardroom atop a pair

355
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,703
走进了会议室
of five-inch Guccis, well,

356
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,656
能让人领略到这一行的权威 
that teaches the authority this business needed.

357
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,770
你要权衡你的框架 每一步都要考虑周全
You have to balance your frame, consider each step,

358
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,605
注入你所有的动力
and lean into your momentum.

359
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,007
最终你将得以升华
You wind up elevated.

360
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,595
大家好 我是Liz Taylor
Gentlemen, I'm Liz Taylor.

361
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,230
Drake先生委任我于此
Mr. Drake has sent me here

362
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,232
来带领公司迈向未来
to lead this company into the future.

363
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,300
直到Drake先生他能够
Until Mr. Drake has the courtesy

364
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,236
亲自现身董事会为止是吧
to appear before this board himself...

365
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,438
副主席先生 我可以向你保证
Mr. Vice-Chairman, I can assure you that Will Drake

366
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,473
Will Drake授予我全权来代表他行事
has granted me full authority to act on his behalf.

368
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,077
我不接受
I don't accept your authority.

369
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:26,727
我恐怕你不得不接受
I'm afraid you'll have to.

370
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,084
我已在Cortez酒店与Will Drake会过面了
I've met with Will Drake at the Hotel Cortez,

371
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:33,320
的确是正式的
and it's official.

372
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,422
Taylor女士在这里有全权
Ms. Taylor here has total authority

373
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,290
可以代表他发言
to speak on his behalf.

374
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,659
你被解雇了
You're fired.

375
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,334
大家注意了 关于重生 我很了解
Now, gentlemen, I know something about rebirth.

376
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:51,437
好好听 好好学
Listen and learn.

377
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,439
不行 我做不到
No! I can't do this!

378
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:58,845
这里四周都弥漫着灵感
There's inspiration all around us.

379
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,880
你所要做的就是去用心看
All you got to do is look.

380
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,319
我留下Will独自一人研究
I left Will alone to work his sorcery,

381
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,687
我去做我该做的事情
and he left me to mine.

382
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:10,490
# 白纱之夜 #
Nights in white satin...

383
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,625
我们让他的缺席变成一种神秘感
We cast his absence as mystery.

384
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,094
他很少在公开场合露面
He gave very little of himself to the public,

385
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,530
业绩需求却开始稳步上升
and demand steadily rose.

386
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,600
他的演出别具一格 独有一番情调
His presentations were exclusive and exotic.

387
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:24,504
并不会邀请太多人 所用模特也是非比寻常的
Very few invitations, very unusual models.

388
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,506
所有的相机和手机都会被禁止使用
All cameras and phones were banned,

389
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,641
这么做会让口碑越来越好
which only made word of mouth stronger,

390
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,976
更加吸引大家的热情
interest more intense.

391
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:35,347
装饰派艺术再次风靡起来
Art deco once again became all the rage.

392
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:38,250
# 我时常错过的美丽 #
Beauty I'd always missed

393
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:40,519
# 在他们眼前 #
With these eyes before

394
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:45,023
# 真相是什么 #
Just what the truth is...

395
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,059
我本该为我们大获成功而欢呼雀跃
I should've been jubilant in our success.

396
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:52,029
但恰恰相反 我很迷惑
But instead, I felt lost.

397
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:56,066
# 因为我爱你 #
'Cause I love you

398
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,735
# 我真的爱你 #
Yes, I love you...

399
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,273
我初遇Tristan的那一刻就像今晚这样
It was a night like this when I first saw Tristan.

400
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:11,447
答应我 你会保持这样开拓性的思维
Just promise me you'll keep an open mind.

401
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,716
拜托 也不看看我是谁
Please, remember to whom you speak.

402
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,152
我们现在在这里做什么
Now, what are we doing here?

403
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,057
我知道你有多想念Tristan
I know how much you miss Tristan.

404
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:23,125
无论他在哪 我也不知道为什么
And wherever he is, I don't know

405
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,795
我们连他的影子都没有看见过
why we haven't seen hide nor hair of him.

406
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:28,798
如果说有人能够联系到他的话
And if anybody can reach him,

407
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:30,833
那就只有这个女人了
this woman can.

408
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:33,769
Iris
Iris...

409
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:36,306
你为我找了个灵媒吗
did you get me a psychic?

411
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:49,018
Billie Dean Howard 这是Liz
Billie Dean Howard, this is Liz.

412
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,486
Liz 很高兴认识你
Liz, it is so good to meet you.

413
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,989
我看过公交车上有贴你的广告
I've seen you on the side of a bus.

414
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,126
Billie Dean在Lifetime电台有自己的节目
Billie Dean has her own show on Lifetime.

415
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,161
她帮助那些失去亲人的人们
She helps the bereaved communicate with

416
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,129
与他们深爱的人们进行沟通
their dearly departed loved ones.

417
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:02,396
我印象很深刻的
I'm impressed.

418
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,765
我如实说
I'll be honest.

419
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,466
在鬼屋界之中
Your establishment is fairly notorious

420
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,837
你们这里可真是大热门啊
among the paranormal communities being a bit of a hot spot.

421
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,239
我刚在想 我可能
I was thinking I might want

422
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,941
想要在这里录一集节目
to do an episode of my show here.

423
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:14,675
但不是今天
But today,

424
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,878
今天我是为你而来
I am here for you.

426
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,334
好多声音
Hmm, so many voices.

427
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,370
你们旅馆很吵闹啊
It's a very noisy hotel.

428
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,720
我感觉到了
Oh, I feel something.

429
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,623
一股充满男人的能量
A very masculine energy.

430
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,659
躁动不安
Restless.

431
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,696
他就在这里
He's here.

432
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,167
鬼魂啊
Spirit,

433
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:19,338
我们敞开心扉 真心实意寻找你
we seek you with loving hearts and open minds.

434
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:24,009
揭开将你我与世隔绝的面纱
Lift the veil that separates our world from yours.

435
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,811
向我们倾诉吧
Speak to us.

436
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,281
Tristan
Tristan.

437
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,809
你好
Hello.

438
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,754
Tristan 我现在和Liz站在一起
Tristan, I'm here with Liz.

439
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,456
她对你甚是想念
She misses you very much.

440
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,493
你有什么话想要对她说吗
Is there any message you have for her?

441
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,199
什么
What?

442
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,801
他说什么
What does he say?

443
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,341
他说
He says...

444
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,008
"没有"
"No."

445
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,777
你说"没有"是什么意思
What do you mean, "No"?

446
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:00,945
什么意思
What-what no?

447
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,779
他并不想说话
He doesn't want to talk.

448
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,781
什么意思 他刚刚跟你说话了
What do you mean? He's talking to you.

449
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,583
他是不想
He doesn't want to talk

450
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:09,019
跟我说
to me.

451
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,955
他一直在这里
He's been here all along.

452
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,958
而且他选择不跟我说话
And he's choosing not to talk to me...

453
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,726
因为他怪我
'cause he blames me.

454
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,895
我导致了他的死亡
I'm the cause of his death.

455
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,964
我对他的爱杀死了他
My love for him killed him.

456
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,765
爱不会死人
Love doesn't kill.

457
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,472
我活得时间更长 让我告诉你
I've been around a lot longer, and let me tell you something.

458
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,440
相信我 因爱而死的人比恨更多
Believe me, love kills a lot more than hate.

459
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,612
不管怎样 感谢你能来
Thank you for coming anyway.

460
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,517
坚强点
Be strong.

461
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:44,653
我知道你懂的
I know you know how.

462
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:47,323
是啊
Yep.

463
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,658
不 不是这样的
No. This isn't right.

464
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,561
不 等等
No, wait.

465
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:55,598
也许跟你说话的不是Tristan
Maybe it wasn't Tristan you were talking to.

466
00:23:57,422 --> 00:24:00,869
他记得那馅饼
He remembers the pancakes.

467
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,753
蓝莓馅的
The ones with the blueberries.

468
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,074
你每周六做给他吃
You made them for him every Saturday

469
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,976
让他看一上午动画片
and let him watch cartoons all morning.

470
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,611
谁是Donovan
Who's Donovan?

471
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,646
怎么了
What?

472
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,417
Donovan不在这里
Donovan isn't here.

473
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,085
不 不 不
No, no, no.

474
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,921
Donovan在别的地方
Donovan is someplace else.

475
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:22,124
在某个仙境
Someplace very beautiful.

476
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,327
他说那里闻起来像馅饼
He says it smells like pancakes.

477
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,297
你做的馅饼
Your pancakes.

478
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:33,067
他说他总是周六的早上在那里
He says it's always Saturday morning where he is.

479
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,571
他说
He says...

480
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,008
我爱你 妈妈
"I love you, Mom."

481
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:44,979
即使我很难过 我依然为我的朋友感到高兴
Even in my grief, I was happy for my friend.

482
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:48,583
至于我 我感受爱的机会已经没了
As for me, I felt any chance at love was over.

483
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,919
但是生命总会给你惊喜
But life can surprise you.

484
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:53,688
特别是新的生命
Especially new life.

485
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,159
以及爱
And love?

486
00:24:58,193 --> 00:25:00,428
这可能有很多方式
Well, that can take many forms.

487
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:03,130
在我和我的儿子Douglas和好后
After I made peace with my son Douglas,

488
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,333
我真的从未想过会再见到他
I never really expected to see him again.

489
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,369
所以当他带Janice来见我时我很开心
So I was delighted when he brought Janice to meet me.

490
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:10,972
我一直想要Janice这样的儿媳妇
Janice was the daughter I always wanted.

491
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,307
而且我也是她一直想要的婆婆
And I was the mother-in-law she'd always hoped for.

492
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:17,511
在Isabelle的脸上 我看到了未来
In Isabelle's face, I saw the future.

493
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:21,181
她出生的年代比我出生那时候
She was being born into a world just a little more accepting

494
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,183
更加包容
than the one I had been born into.

495
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,352
可能 只是可能
And maybe, just maybe,

496
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:28,321
我可以为此做点什么
I had a little something to do with that.

497
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:31,157
一点善意和认可
A little kindness, acceptance.

498
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:35,662
除此之外没什么能改变我
That transformed me in ways nothing else ever could.

499
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:38,231
我从未想过人生会这么好
I never thought life could be this good.

500
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:43,603
以及生命可能会这样结束
Or that it might end.

501
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,638
该死
Well, shit!

502
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,140
你确定
Are you sure?

503
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:48,274
是的
I'm sure.

505
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:51,478
医生确诊了
the doctor is sure.

506
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:53,846
他们不能做点什么吗
And there ain't nothing they can do about it?

507
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:57,683
过了治疗的时机了
It's... past the point of treatment.

508
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:00,720
这可能是最好的结果
Which is probably for the best.

509
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:03,723
因为
'Cause...

510
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:05,958
我可能会讨厌失去我的头发
I would hate to lose my hair.

511
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:10,763
乖乖
Baby girl,

512
00:26:10,797 --> 00:26:13,633
我可能能为你做点什么
there just might be something that I can do for you.

514
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:16,602
什么 转变我
What, turn me?

515
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:18,704
老天 我甚至都不喜欢带血的牛排
Hell, I don't even like my steak bloody.

516
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:20,272
但我从没想过这样做
But that's never been an option for me.

517
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,473
你知道的
You know that.

518
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:24,544
在我人生中的这个时刻
And at this point in my life,

519
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:28,380
我不敢想象为了生存去杀戮
I can't imagine killing in order to live.

520
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,670
你跟你的孩子说了没
So have you told your kids yet?

521
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,219
运气好的话 我就不用说了
With any luck, I won't need to.

522
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,522
他们可以一直到这里来看我
They can just keep visiting me here.

523
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,905
我就不废话了
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

524
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,542
我是世界上第一个患有前列腺癌的女人
I am the first woman in the world to have prostate cancer.

525
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:01,713
医生告诉我已经扩散到脊椎了
Uh, the doctor told me it's spread to the spine

526
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,348
已经没治了
and there's nothing to do.

527
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:11,622
我们会不惜一切代价
We'll spend whatever we have to.

528
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:14,292
一个电话我就能为你联系到世界上最好的医生
One call and I can get you to the best doctor in the world.

529
00:27:14,326 --> 00:27:15,493
太晚了
Oh, it's too late.

530
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:18,129
我不想在医院
And I don't want to spend

531
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:20,131
挂着个尿袋 不断的打针吃药
my last days wasting away in a hospital

532
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:22,433
浪费我最后的日子
with a catheter up my dick and poison in my body,

533
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:24,435
所以
so...

534
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,637
但谁会来照顾我们
But who will take care of us?

535
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,772
- 你不能丢下我们 - 我不会的
You can't leave us alone. I won't.

536
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:30,941
这就是我今天把你们都叫过来的原因
That's why I called you all here today.

537
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:35,713
现在 我给你们提供了各种武器
Now, I have provided you with various weapons.

538
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:38,315
挑两个吧 它们很小
Take two. They're small.

540
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,519
砍我
hack me.

541
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:44,554
勒我
Strangle me.

542
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,657
重击我
Bludgeon me.

543
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:49,660
给我惊喜
Surprise me.

544
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:52,529
我想我能代表这里的每个人去说
I think I can speak for everyone here when I say

545
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,964
我们全都开始变得喜欢你了
that we've all grown rather fond of you.

546
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,933
我们不可能杀你的
We can't possibly murder you.

547
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,468
这不是谋杀
It's not murder.

548
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:01,271
她想要重生
She wants to be reborn.

549
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:10,180
你们是我的家人
You're my family.

550
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,152
我想要永远和你们在一起
I want to be with you forever.

565 
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:14,175 
这是她死后的第一次我见到她
It was the first time I'd seen her since she died.

559
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,911
直到那一刻我才意识到
Only in that moment did I realize

560
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:20,014
我有多想她
just how much I'd missed her.

561
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:22,583
你怎么出现了
How did you know to come?

562
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:26,787
你一直是我最爱的作品
You were always my fondest creation.

573 
00:29:37,117 --> 00:29:39,465 
我想在这里帮你转生
I wanted to be here to help you transition.

578 
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:57,083 
最后一次
One last time.

575
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:43,829
这东西会害死你的
Those things'll kill you.

576
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:55,740
我不明白
I don't understand.

577
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,776
你都不跟我说话
You wouldn't talk to me.

578
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,013
我以为你恨我
I thought you hated me.

579
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:04,048
我爱你
I love you.

580
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,388
亲爱的
And, darlin',

581
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:12,724
你要活得更久
you had more living to do.

582
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:14,759
我不能这样妨碍你
I couldn't get in the way of that.

583
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:23,301
宝贝
Oh, baby...

584
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:25,637
你太好了
you are to die for.

585
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:37,328
- 有什么需要吗 - 我有个预约
- May I help you? - I have a reservation.

586
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:38,648
44号房
Room 44.

587
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,284
求爱屋
The Woo room.

588
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,852
Billie Dean说那是他死的地方
That's where Billie Dean says he died.

589
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:43,493
那间被预定了
Oh, that room is booked.

590
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,689
被我订了 三星期前

597

她已有三个黄金特刊了

604
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,398
我是说 别误解了我的意思

606
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,368
只是那些希望被鬼魂蹂躏的
It's just those freaks and weirdos

607
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,270
奇奇怪怪的家伙

Billie吸引来的人 他们会...

对我们的品牌不好的

610
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,437

Will Drake不再需要钱了

620
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:01,804
我不喜欢她来拜访

627
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,429
该死的

00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,897
打电话给她
Call her.

629
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:30,398
让她入住我的房间

630
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:31,867

We are standing in room 64 of the Hotel Cortez,

633
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:48,683
这是臭名昭著的十诫杀手许多年前
where the notorious Ten Commandments Killer lived

634
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,285
在洛杉矶实施恐怖统治时住过的地方

635
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:55,256
John Lowe可能是我所尝试联系的
John Lowe may be the most evil and dangerous spirit

636
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,359
最邪恶也最危险的灵魂
with whom I have ever attempted to make contact.

637
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:02,764
我需要集中我所有的技术和能量
I will need all of my skills and powers of concentration

638
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,400
来达成这次史无前例的采访
to achieve this unprecedented interview.

639
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,981

我想让你来谈谈

642
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,811
我们所知道的关于John Lowe的事都是警察那儿得来的
All we know about John Lowe is what the police have said.

643
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:38,265
我现在给你一个机会来为自己陈述
I'm giving you a chance now to set the record straight.

644
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:58,217
你想要知道什么
What do you want to know?

645
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:03,088
我们就从你的家庭开始吧
Why don't we start with your family.

646
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:04,657
他们知道
Did they know

647
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,292
你是一个杀人恶魔吗
you were a serial killer?

648
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:09,554
- 你给Holden准备了什么晚餐 - 还是狗肉
- What'd you get Holden for dinner? - It's dog again.

649
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:10,860
他们慢慢理解了
They came to understand

650
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:12,706
我是在用我自己的方式
that I was cleaning up the world,

651
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:14,894
- 净化这个世界 - 该死的 John
- in my own way. - Goddamn it, John.

652
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,857
我们谈过这个 我的目标都是
We talked about this; I was not gonna target people

653
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:18,326
那些该死的人
who do not deserve to die.

654
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,127
现在 你一旦潜逃了
Now, once you went on the lam,

655
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:23,197
你就再也见不到你的妻子和两个孩子了
your wife and two children were never seen again.

656
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:24,098
快点
Come on.

657
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,599
- 你要去哪儿 - 他饿了
- Where are you going? - He's hungry.

658
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:26,767
我知道怎样不被察觉的
I know how to walk into a hospital

659
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:27,768
走去医院
and not get noticed.

660
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:29,670
你杀了他们吗
Did you kill them?

661
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:33,274
我会承认 我对不起他们
I will admit, I failed them.

662
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,286
爸爸
Daddy?

663
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,156
只剩一件事情要做了
There's only one thing left to do.

664
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,659
自首吗
Turn myself in?

665
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,695
我们必须得回家
We have to go home.

666
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,002
Scarlett是对的
Scarlett was right.

667
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,837
科尔特斯[科罗拉多州]是家
The Cortez was home.

668
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:07,239
我们以某种方式 在那里重生
We'd all been reborn there, in one form or another.

669
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:09,441
除了她以外
Well, except for her.

670
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:11,443
我们的女儿仍有机会
There was a still a chance for our daughter

671
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:13,379
在别的地方长大
to grow up somewhere else,

672
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:16,415
有机会过平凡的生活
to have some shot at a normal life.

673
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,485
但是这需要远离我们
But it needed to be away from us.

674
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,453
Liz正好知道一个地方
Liz knew just the place.

675
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,322
撒切尔学校会接收很多
The Thatcher School would be host

676
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:27,291
科尔特斯旅馆避难的年轻人
to more than one young refugee from the Hotel Cortez.

677
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:30,428
所以你把你女儿送走了
So you sent your daughter away,

678
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:33,632
但是跟你的妻子和儿子一起生活在斯尔特斯
but lived with your son and wife in the Cortez,

679
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:37,636
回到仍在追捕你的洛杉矶
back in L.A., where you were still being hunted.

680
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,039
当你在逃亡的时候很难顾及家庭
It's hard to provide for your family when you're on the run.

681
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:45,176
在洛杉矶会有更多的机会
There were more opportunities in Los Angeles.

682
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:27,784
站住 John Lowe 你被捕了
Stop! John Lowe, you're under arrest!

683
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:29,719
我必须要回到旅馆
I have to make it back to the hotel.

684
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:55,444
让我...
Let me...

685
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,924
我要死在里面
I want to die inside.

686
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:05,754
我能感觉到你的妻子和儿子
I'm sensing something about your wife and son.

687
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:10,695
我能听到灵魂的暗流
I can hear the undercurrents from the spirits,

688
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:12,998
但是他们太惊恐了说不清楚话
but they are too afraid to speak clearly.

689
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,866
为什么会这样
Why is that?

690
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,602
我不想谈论我的家庭
I don't want to talk about my family.

691
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:19,504
好啊 如果你不想再说关于家庭的事
Well, if you don't want to talk about your family,

692
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:20,905
那么告诉我点别的
then give me something else.

693
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,844
十月三十日为什么那么重要
What is the significance of October 30?

694
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:29,613
为什么那是我唯一感受到你现身在这儿的日子
Why is it the only day I feel your presence here?

695
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:34,018
这是属于恶魔的夜晚
Well, it's Devil's Night.

696
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:37,521
如果你把你的摄制组留在这儿
And if you leave your camera crew behind,

697
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:39,556
我就能展示给你看
that I can show you.

698
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,817
他们在尖叫
They're screaming.

699
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:04,820
我曾经在西边的一栋房子里
I was in a house once just west of here.

700
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:09,591
我能听到墙里的灵魂 像是白蚁...
And I could hear the spirits in the walls like termites...

701
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:13,575
或是阁楼上的老鼠
or bats in the attic.

702
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:16,678
但从没见过现在这样
But it was nothing like this.

703
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:21,082
这像是在亡者的摇滚音乐会中一样
This is like being in a rock concert of the dead.

704
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,119
来吧
Well, come on.

705
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,055
让我引荐给你亡者的摇滚明星
Let me introduce you to some rock stars of the dead.

706
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:31,660
噢 Jeffrey 你和你该死的吸管
Oh, Jeffrey, you and your damn straws.

707
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:36,097
快来 放下你的饮料来跟我跳舞吧
Come on. Put your drink down and come and dance with me.

708
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:38,166
我不跳舞
I don't dance.

709
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,000
看着我
Look at me.

710
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,003
我也不跳
Neither do I.

711
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:45,839
John 噢
John! Oh!

712
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:48,842
Jeffrey 看看是谁来了
Jeffrey, look who's here.

713
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:50,444
John来了
John is here.

714
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:52,879
他是他们里面最棒的
He's the greatest of them all.

715
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,881
你在脸红吗
Are you blushing?

716
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:58,485
我告诉过你 如果你喜欢一个人 你必须要跟他讲话
I told you, if you like a guy, you have to talk to him.

717
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,487
你觉得如果我没有胆子接近他们&
You think any of those young men

718
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:02,888
这些年轻人
would have come over to work at my house if I didn't have

719
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,858
真的会来我的屋子工作吗
the guts to approach them in the world?

720
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:10,162
这些密尔沃基的家伙一定极度渴望
Well, those guys in Milwaukee must have been pretty desperate

721
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:11,831
跟着Jeffrey回家的
to go home with Jeffrey.

722
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:14,500
这个男孩说两个字就会脸红的
The guy can't get two words out without going flush.

723
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,971
噢 天呐
Oh, my God.

724
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:21,006
你是John Wayne Gacy
You're John Wayne Gacy.

725
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:26,278
那是Jeffrey Dahmer
And that's Jeffrey Dahmer.

726
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:31,350
你被吓到了吗
Are you frightened?

727
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:34,019
没有
Oh, no.

728
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:38,881
我只是让纯洁的灵魂围绕在我周围
No, I just surround myself with the white light of spirit and...

729
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,294

字幕
Tell me,

759
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:25,293
字幕
what is that like?

760
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:28,296
字幕
Is it a moving picture, like so many cells on a film reel?

761
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:31,032
字幕
Or more like a kaleidoscope of human suffering?

762
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,159
字幕
It's not a picture.

763
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:35,434
字幕
It's a feeling.

764
00:42:36,296 --> 00:42:40,240
字幕
Like a mist on your face on a cold morning.

765
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:45,980
字幕
You can't see it in the air, but you can feel...

766
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:47,782
字幕
the wetness.

767
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,784

字幕
My Murderers' Row!

772
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,147
字幕
How odd it must be to see all of us then

773
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,486
字幕
in what appears to be the flesh.

774
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,022
字幕
Flesh enough to eat,

775

字幕
drink,

776
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:33,660
字幕
feel our grip on your arm,

777
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,762
字幕
our breath on your skin.

778
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:38,365
字幕
No!

779
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:44,204
字幕
How's that white light holding up, Billie Dean?

780
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:46,473
字幕
I don't want to be here anymore.

781
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:48,876
字幕
When does the party favor arrive?

782
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,911
字幕
John's taken care of that.

783
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:52,346
字幕
Grab your weapons,

784
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,846
字幕
ladies and gents.

785
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:56,182
字幕
No.

786
00:43:58,047 --> 00:43:59,847
字幕
No.

787
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:03,089
字幕
Can't throw a killer party without a little killing, right?

788
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:05,925
字幕
Don't worry, Billie.

789
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:08,261
字幕
I think you're gonna like living here.

790
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:10,096
字幕
Here's the deal.

791
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,598
字幕
No more specials or interviews

792
00:44:12,632 --> 00:44:15,154
字幕
or books or tweets or casual conversations

793
00:44:15,274 --> 00:44:17,103
字幕
at cocktail parties with Shirley MacLaine

794
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:18,637
字幕
about this hotel.

795
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:20,639
字幕
This place is dead to you.

796
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:22,141
字幕
We will become a myth,

797
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,943
字幕
which is what we should've been left to do anyway.

798
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:26,378
字幕
What if I don't?

799
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:28,113
字幕
One sure-as-shit thing I can tell you

800
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:31,383
字幕
about being murdered: it hurts.

801
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:34,752
字幕
And we like to make it last...

802
00:44:35,986 --> 00:44:38,866
字幕
None of you can leave the hotel, so...

803
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:43,765
字幕
you can't hold me to my word, huh?

804
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:46,597
字幕
But I can.

805
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:51,636
字幕
What the hell are you?

806
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,472
字幕
You're not dead.

807
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:55,974
字幕
I'm a creature

808
00:44:56,008 --> 00:44:58,609
字幕
who kills to live

809
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:01,245
字幕
and who drinks a body's worth of blood a day

810
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:02,712
字幕
and doesn't think twice about

811
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:05,549
字幕
who I'm sucking it from.

812
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,252
字幕
So, if you even let out a whisper of a word

813
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,987
字幕
that sounds like "Cortez,"

814
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:13,991
字幕
I'll find you and drain every drop of life

815
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:16,660
字幕
from your skinny ass.

816
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,495
字幕
I can't be the only one here

817
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:20,130
字幕
hoping you say no.

818
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:21,698
字幕
No!

819
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:26,136
字幕
No! No!

820
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:03,607
字幕
Did you take care of what you had to take care of?

821
00:46:03,641 --> 00:46:04,674
字幕
Yeah.

822
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:07,110
字幕
Look at you, Scarlett.

823
00:46:07,144 --> 00:46:08,845
字幕
Where'd my little girl go?

824
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,346
字幕
You're just saying that 'cause

825
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:12,548
字幕
I'm the only member of the family that ages.

826
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:16,552
字幕
Thanks for coming.

827
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:18,954
字幕
Tonight means a lot to me.

828
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:20,390
字幕
For us

829
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:22,158
字幕
all to be together.

830
00:46:22,192 --> 00:46:24,127
字幕
Even just for a few hours.

831
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,995
字幕
Of course, Dad.

832
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,398
字幕
Means a lot to me, too.

833
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:31,000
字幕
Go on.

834
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,003
字幕
Get into bed with them.

835
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,838
字幕
Not you?

836
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:37,073
字幕
I'm getting a little big

837
00:46:37,107 --> 00:46:38,874
字幕
for the family bed.

838
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:40,910
字幕
I'll take the chair.

839
00:46:51,387 --> 00:46:53,488
字幕
I'm afraid to fall asleep.

840
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:56,858
字幕
As soon as I close my eyes,

841
00:46:56,892 --> 00:46:59,894
字幕
it'll all be gone for another year.

842
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:02,364
字幕
It's okay, Daddy.

843
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,101
字幕
Rest.

844
00:48:20,852 --> 00:48:23,369
字幕
What brings you to the Cortez?

845
00:48:24,345 --> 00:48:26,312
字幕
Tomorrow's Halloween.

846
00:48:26,347 --> 00:48:29,081
字幕
This place is supposed to be haunted, right?

847
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:31,984
字幕
I'm meeting some friends here.

848
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:33,719
字幕
No, you're not.

849
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:36,289
字幕
I'm not?

850
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:38,324
字幕
No.

851
00:48:41,895 --> 00:48:44,596
