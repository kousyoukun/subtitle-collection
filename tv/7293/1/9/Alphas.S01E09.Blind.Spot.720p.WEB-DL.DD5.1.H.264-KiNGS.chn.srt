1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,180
A possible Red Flag prisoner is in our offices.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,400
Cameron said that he and Nina had him subdued,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
and now they're bringing him here.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,610
I thought Sullivan wanted an approach and evaluate.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,550
See if the man is an Alpha or any Red Flag connections.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,820
Clearly things went another way.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,790
So we still don't know what his ability is?

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,070
No.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,500
Well, it's a good thing we got this thing up and running.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,720
19, 68, 16, 7.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,570
That's not your birthday, is it?

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,130
Super bowl III.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,820
Jets beat the Colts 16-7.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,830
Yeah, but you couldn't have been old enough to have been there.

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,960
I was six months old.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,340
I even have a photo of my dad holding me while he was watching the game,

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,330
so that makes me a Jets fan for life, baby.

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,760
And we're coming. You see what we did last year, right?

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,580
Yeah, that's football, right, Bill? Uh, yeah, football.

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,030
Anyway, so we got bulletproof, polarized glass.

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,200
We've got industrial-grade surge suppressors, fire-retardant foam.

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,010
And the best part is we got an emergency lockdown, the whole office.

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,130
So the windows, doors, everything shut.

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,290
Now, if only we can get D.O.D. to buy us a new car.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,370
Can they do that?

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,290
Oh, gosh, Bill, I-I don't know.

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,010
I've allowed this to go so far beyond what I envisioned for all of us.

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,560
Doc, you got to get over that. We're not longer just your patients.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,750
We're a government asset.

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,150
What's the expression, dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,770
You got to go with the flow, right? Isn't that what you always tell me?

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,560
Look, ever since that mess with Jonas Englin,

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
I've lost my ability-- I'm here, right? I'm good with it. You're good with it, so--

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,320
No, I'm not all that good with it. It's not who you are,

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,440
and the D.O.D. isn't happy either.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,620
Actually, I'm trying to figure out a way to get the ability back.

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,330
You're a fine investigator, Bill, but as far as the government's concerned,

38
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,190
we are a group of Alphas.

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,880
Well, you're not an Alpha. You're still here, right?

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,830
- And besides, Doc... - Huh?

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,030
Jeannie and I are thinking about renovating the kitchen.

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,490
So, please, keep those checks coming. This isn't gonna work.

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,860
This isn't gonna work. They ignored my checklist. I made a detailed list.

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,130
Sleep gas dispensers and telepathy blockers and some automated gun turrets.

45
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,620
Gary, those things don't exist. Yeah, I like the old Bill better.

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,260
You'd take things seriously,

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,510
and your veins would pop out when things weren't right, and this isn't right.

48
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,810
Why aren't your veins popping out anymore? I don't have to worry about that anymore.

49
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,250
Why are you still here, then? You're not even an Alpha anymore.

50
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,160
If I wasn't here, you'd miss me, right?

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,860
You being gone and you being different are the same thing.

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,670
Whatever, Bill. Whatever.

53
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,290
???I got it.

54
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,040
Are you hearing me? What was that noise?

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,340
Check, over? Bill, Ten-four?

56
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,390
Uh, Rachel, this is not a police radio.

57
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,710
- You can speak normally. - Okay. I hear them.

58
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,950
They're in the elevator with Dr. Kern. All right, thanks.let's go

59
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,650
Sorry about this.

60
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,980
Were able to confirm any Red Flag connection?

61
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,670
We barely sat down before he got suspicious.

62
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,010
What about an Alpha ability?

63
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,920
I tried to push him, but it just didn't work.

64
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
I want to run some MRIs first,

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,050
then we can put him in the holding cell.

66
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,170
Let's move fast before he wakes up.

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,920
Doc, you okay?

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,730
Uh, yeah. It's just, um...

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,970

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,810
Please don't wake him up.

73
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,530
Relax, Rachel. You know I still have my gun,

74
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,130
and I am a better shot when I'm not all amped up.

75
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,220
You know, Bill, I was thinking,

76
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,250
if I dosed you with a mixture of adrenaline and steroids,

77
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,040
we might be able to jump-start your ability. Doc, I am not interested.

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,030
All that got me was issues, right? Marriage issues, work issues and--

79
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,070
No, I-I understand your concerns. Who needs it?

80
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,660
We might.

81
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,080
We all have our issues, but we're learning how to control them.

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,210
Yeah, well, I'm all in control now. Thank you very much.

83
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,100
All right, let's see what we have here.

84
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,360
Paperwork already? God, you're so motivated.

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,340
I used to ignore it and pretend it would go away, but it never did.

86
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,470
Cream, no sugar, right?

87
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,380
I pay attention.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,860
I wonder what tipped Kern off to us. Guy's an obstetrician.

89
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,060
He sees happy couples all the time. I guess he didn't see that in us.

90
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,690
And what, we don't buy the whole happy-couple thing?

91
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,520
No, look, I'm not saying that.

92
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,100
Rosen thinks that it's a bad idea,

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,440
you and me.

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,980
Wait a minute. You told him?

95
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,600
Well, he's our shrink.

96
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,200
Why, is it because, um...

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,460
because I'm divorced and in A.A.?

98
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,140
Or maybe it's because I have a kid.

99
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,890
We work together. It would be unprofessional.

100
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,270
No, we do things in this job all the time that are unprofessional, and you know that.

101
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,590
That's not it.

102
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,730
He thinks that I'd be bad for you,

103
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,160
and...

104
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,680
He might be right.

105
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,530
Cam, I've screwed up every relationship I've ever had.

106
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,550
Me too.

107
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,940
So we're perfect for each other.

108
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,800
Hey, guys.

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,040
Um, Doc found something. We got a meeting.

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,720
Yeah, we're on our way.

111
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,130
How can Kern be blind? Because he has no optic nerve.

112
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,730
The MRI revealed something, uh, well, pretty interesting.

113
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,130
It's as if they never developed. So, even if his eyes were functioning properly,

114
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,340
as they appear to be, no visual data would ever reach his brain.

115
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,870
Which is why I couldn't push him. He couldn't see me.

116
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,630
Look, when things got ugly, that guy dodged around his desk, and he ran straight for the door.

117
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,780
There is no way he's blind.

118
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,930
Well, unless he's an Alpha, which I have some ideas about,

119
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,790
uh, but I need to run a few more tests.

120
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,880
So we're talking about a blind Alpha that's a baby Doc and a member of Red Flag?

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,610
Where's my phone? Who's got my phone?

122
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,940
Bill? Bill! Bill!

123
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,890
Gary, I've been here the whole time. What are you talking about?

124
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah, where'd you put my phone? Gary, I've been here the whole time.

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,290
Gary, your phone is right here. Oh, well, that's not okay.

126
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,550
People shouldn't be touching my phone. It was a gift. It's special.

127
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,880
Yes, okay, and it's back in your hands.

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,530
- It's fine. - Yeah. No, it's not, 'cause it's open to data files, and those are private.

129
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,370
Yes, Gary's phone is private. Please, no one is to touch it unless they have Gary's permission, all right?

130
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,850
Yeah, and the answer's no.

131
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,350
To get back to our case, the reason Dr. Kern is here--

132
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,860
D.O.D. suspects that he's been doing some sort of research,

133
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,440
and they are hoping that we can figure out why.

134
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,320
And more to the point, a radicalized Alpha

135
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,160
who is also an obstetrician, that's a disturbing thought to say the least.

136
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,290
Well, we cleaned out his office-- hard drive, cell phone, patient files.

137
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,940
Meds, vitamins, blood samples.

138
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,940
Which, Rachel, you'll take a look at? Yeah. That's great.

139
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,260
And, Gary, you will look into the cell phone and computer transmissions?

140
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,880
That's just data mining. People without abilities can data-mine.

141
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,580
Well, you know, we all can't do that.

142
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,240
- I can't do it, Gary. - Neither can I.

143
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,630
No, we all know that you are so much more than your abilities, Gary.

144
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,500
- You have very many talents. - I know. I'm amazing.

145
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,870
warning:human urine

146
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,380
My lucky day.

147
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,730
Gary?

148
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,370
Hello?

149
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,520
Hello?

150
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,590
Who's there?

151
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,190
Did you call me? I'm working.

152
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,040
Do not disturb, that's my I.M. chat status.

153
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,110
I should get a sign.

154
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,480
Hey, Gary, were you just there by my office? Rachel, you're not making sense.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,650
I told you, I'm working.

156
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,450
I work in my office.

157
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,520
Bill, will you remove the mouth strap? You sure?

158
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,510
Yes, I have the test results I need.

159
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,000
I just would like to speak with him.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,540
Okay, whatever.

161
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,660
Let me tell you something... Happiness is a warm gun.

162
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,140
And mine is a Sig 226. You got me?

163
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,490
I want my lawyer. Yeah, and I want a Reuben sandwich.

164
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,180
I'll have my lawyer pick you up one.

165
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,450
Well, unfortunately, Doctor Kern, you're being detained because of suspected involvement

166
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,380
with a terrorist organization.

167
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,080
The only organization I belong to is the A.M.A.

168
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,120
So, what, Alphas, ability, Red Flag--

169
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,770
that means nothing to you?

170
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,390
Bill, will you take the cuffs off,

171
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,900
stand him up, and have him face the glass?

172
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,100
Get up slowly. Keep your arms up.

173
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,890
Turn around and face the wall, please.

174
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,000
What is this, a cavity check?

175
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,880
That's just as I thought...

176
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,730
sonar, echolocation.

177
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,730
- So he's like a bat? - Or a dolphin.

178
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,640
You can sit down now.

179
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,810
Very interesting. You have no optic nerves.

180
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,810
However, the audio-processing capabilities

181
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,940
of your brain, your voice box,

182
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,880
the chambers in your sinus passages

183
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,480
are all significantly enhanced. You're an Alpha.

184
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,760
But of course you already know that. This isn't going to end well.

185
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,140
Is that a threat?

186
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,770
Hey, Cley, Rosen and I are going to keep working with him,

187
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,980
and Rachel's nosing around through what we found in his office.

188
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,740
Yeah, Rosen thinks that he's probably said about as much as he's going to,

189
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,380
so why don't you come scoop him up?

190
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,680
All right, what, two hours?

191
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,510
From Knoxville?

192
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,440
All right, have a safe flight.

193
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,420
Doc, can we talk? I'm a bit busy, Cameron, can we--

194
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,910
No, it won't take long.

195
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,670
Look, I just wanted to say, um, me and Nina...

196
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,030
If you just give us a little space

197
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,070
and let us figure some things out for ourselves...

198
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,070
I'm only trying to look out for the both of you.

199
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,180
Well, I get that, but we're adults.

200
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,290
We get to make our own mistakes, so, please, just let it go.

201
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,250
I'd like to, but as your psychiatrist and your employer,

202
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,170
I don't think I can do that.

203
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,760
And I don't think you're in a place to make that decision.

204
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,210
Am I interrupting? I'm always interrupting.

205
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,320
I'm sorry, but I found something in the box I was going through.

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,690
It's important.

207
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,120
Here, look at these.

208
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,640
"Building blocks for a better baby."

209
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,110
Yeah, they're vitamins for pregnant women.

210
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,610
I decided to break one open and take a look inside-- you know, really take a look.

211
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,630
Rachel, what did you find?

212
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,730
DNA...

213
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,740
active human DNA inside the vitamins.

214
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,510
Active human DNA

215
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,060
introduced into a developing fetus

216
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,400
could cause multiple birth defects, severe mutations.

217
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,430
Yeah, that's what I was worried about.

218
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,240
Hold on a second. I smell blood...

219
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,690
in the hallway.

220
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,560
Nina. It just started bleeding.

221
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,570
I haven't had one of these since I was a kid.

222
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,830
Oh, gosh, look up. Are you dizzy?

223
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,990
- No, it's okay. - Headache or anything?

224
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,890
It was just a few broken capillaries,

225
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,200
nothing serious, but were you picking?

226
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,690
I don't pick.

227
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,780
Here, take this.

228
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,550
You'll be fine. Just clean it up, okay?

229
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,330
Yeah. Good.

230
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,500
Are you aware you have mitral valve prolapse--

231
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,800
three millimeters of displacement?

232
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,650
You just did an ultrasound of my chest.

233
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,300
You should get that looked at.

234
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,710
Well, I have a heart exam twice a year.

235
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,780
I'm monitoring it, but, uh...

236
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,060
thank you for your concern, though.

237
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,230
Like you, I took an oath...

238
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,960
do no harm.

239
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,790
I may be an Alpha, but I'm a doctor first. I hope you'll keep that in mind.

240
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,240
No harm.

241
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,360
What kind of doctor gives active human DNA

242
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,110
to pregnant women?

243
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,460
Someone who cares about the future.

244
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,970
Whose future?

245
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,760
You're aware of Renestrin--

246
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,230
new drug that allegedly prevents birth defects?

247
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,610
But what it really does is interferes with the fetal development

248
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,450
of more evolved children.

249
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,840
What you're really saying is it prevents babies from being born as Alphas.

250
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,180
Consider my special vitamins the counteragent.

251
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,340
Are you planning to distribute your counteragent

252
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,010
all by yourself?

253
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,660
Can any of your team read minds?

254
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,800
Well, I guess there's some questions that aren't meant to be answered.

255
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,720
Dr. Rosen, I know what's going to happen next.

256
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,160
Men with guns will whisk me away to some government facility.

257
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,500
That would be a tragic, tragic error.

258
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,950
Well, I'm afraid the real tragedy

259
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,140
is you choosing to join a terrorist organization.

260
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,770
Red Flag isn't as monolithic as you think it is.

261
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,160
Well, regardless of its scope, you and your friends tried to assassinate me.

262
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,340
Fringe elements, radicals, not representative of the mainstream.

263
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,810
You know, it's amazing how often people use that term--

264
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,680
"fringe elements."

265
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,440
Occurs to me that the I.R.A.,

266
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,200
P.L.O., K.K.K.--

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,070
all fringe elements

268
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,540
whose very existence depends upon the support

269
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,440
of their mainstream fellow travelers.

270
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,270
I've read your field reports, Doctor.

271
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,510
You advocate a future where Alphas and normal humans

272
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,750
cooperate for the common good.

273
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,290
That's the future I want.

274
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,410
We should be working together, comparing notes.

275
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,220
You're inviting me to join Red Flag?

276
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm afraid I don't meet their entry requirements.

277
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,140
I see a time coming soon

278
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,770
where the unenhanced will be able to join our cause.

279
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,810
That's where you belong.

280
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,250
Dr. Kern, if you're willing to disclose

281
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,270
what exactly it is you're up to,

282
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,090
I'm willing to intervene on your behalf.

283
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,360
Impasse.

284
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm disappointed for you, Doctor.

285
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
Well...

286
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,020
I'm not the one going to Binghamton.

287
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,610
What makes you think I am?

288
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,500
Bill? Hicks?

289
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,630
Come on, guys, this better not be a joke.

290
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,240
This guy's holding out on us.

291
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,800
Any ideas how we break him down?

292
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,040
- Well, he's sonic guy, right? - Yeah.

293
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,630
Maybe it's time we pull out the Captain & Tennille's

294
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,240
<i>Muskrat Love.</i>

295
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,330
- Sonic warfare. - Mm-hmm.

296
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,570
Yeah, it's been known to work.

297
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,860
Just remember, anything we force him to listen to we got to hear it as well.

298
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,910
Trust me, we used the same trick on detainees in Bagram.

299
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,210
Still feel sick every time I hear <i>Copacabana.</i>

300
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,480
- I love that song. - Oh, come on.

301
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,520
I do. It's one of my favorites.

302
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,730
You hear that? Gary screwing with the computers again?

303
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,510
I can't get in the system.

304
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,920
It seems like it's running some sort of keypad retrieval.

305
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,140
- Have you seen Rachel? - No, not lately.

306
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,990
She's not in her office, and no one's seen her for a half hour.

307
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,250
Why don't you scream for her?

308
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,760
Yeah, I did, okay? She's gone.

309
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,890
- Rachel? - Rachel?

310
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,360
Rachel, if you can hear us, say something. Nothing, nothing.

311
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,390
There's something wrong with the security cameras.

312
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,260
Gary, come here, come here. Show me what you're looking at.

313
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,510
- Pull it up on the monitor. - Okay, it's glitchy.

314
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,990
Give me Rachel's office an hour ago.

315
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,540
Something's making it glitch. Yeah.

316
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,280
Okay, okay, there she is,

317
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,350
in her office going over the stuff from Kern.

318
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,610
Can--can you fast-forward?

319
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,100
It's glitchy, though. It's glitchy.

320
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,900
Okay, wait, wait. Here, here. And then she leaves.

321
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,100
Oh, no, wait, wait. I found her.

322
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,710
20 minutes ago. There.

323
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,840
There.

324
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,870
Hicks! Nina!

325
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,070
Stay here. This way.

326
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,010
Rachel!

327
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,360
Rachel?

328
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,960
Rachel, where are you?

329
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,950
This is the last place she was seen on camera, right?

330
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,410
Yeah. Rachel!

331
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,630
- Oh, my God. - What?

332
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,850
Over here.

333
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,450
It's blood, and it--

334
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,190
I got blood here, too. Okay, and these look like drag marks, right?

335
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,860
Starting over there. No, they start here.

336
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,920
Well, she couldn't have just evaporated. What the hell?

337
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,320
Rachel, where are you? Rachel?

338
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,960
Hey, take a look at this.

339
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,780
Was this like this when we moved in?

340
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,410
What are you doing?

341
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,050
Where's Rachel? Rachel?

342
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,650
Which one's Rachel, the tall one?

343
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,100
- The other woman. - I never met her.

344
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,530
You can do more with your sonar than just find things.

345
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,140
I'm chained to a table.

346
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,310
I can't run around abducting people with my voice.

347
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,870
Besides, my hearing is quite good.

348
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,930
The number of heartbeats on this floor hasn't changed since I awoke.

349
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,480
How many are you hearing?

350
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,740
Do we really have to play this ridiculous game?

351
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,480
There are eight. There have always been eight.

352
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,000
Yours, mine, and the six members of your team, I assume.

353
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,510
We haven't been properly introduced.

354
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,110
Dr. Kern, there are only six of us, that includes Rachel and myself.

355
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,240
Plus you, that's seven.

356
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,370
What?

357
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,010
Have things...

358
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,450
Have things gone missing around your office...

359
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,360
Strange sounds,

360
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,380
computers turning on randomly,

361
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,300
people sensing someone nearby without ever seeing anyone?

362
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,490
You have an unwelcome guest.

363
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,890
What are you saying,

364
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,170
That--that Rachel's been kidnapped

365
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,010
and that the person is still here in the building?

366
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,010
Let me solve your problem. Let me help you, or we're all dead.

367
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,860
Why should I believe anything you say? All right, don't. Don't.

368
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,420
But one member of your team is down already.

369
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,040
Ignore me, things will only get worse.

370
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,200
Let me out!

371
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,940
Before it's too late, let me out!

372
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,320
You need to let me out! I'm the only one who can keep us alive.

373
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,840
Don't need to hear that. I don't trust that guy for a second.

374
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,010
Look, I searched the entire office again-- still no Rachel.

375
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,740
And we got nothing to go on except what Kern is saying.

376
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,500
I can't wait for Cley to show up and get this guy out of here.

377
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,150
Not until we find Rachel.

378
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,180
Yeah, I think we-- we should at least consider what Kern is saying.

379
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,030
An intruder would certainly explain some of the strange things that have been happening here.

380
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,960
Hey, Doc, earlier today, I thought I was imagining something, right?

381
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,930
But I felt that someone was watching me.

382
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,940
I turned around, and there was no one there. Exactly, Bill.

383
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,990
That is called proprioception.

384
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,080
It's one of the ways we have of processing the million bits of information

385
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,390
in our environment around us.

386
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,550
Like you said, if you find yourself in a room full of people, you sense something.

387
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,810
Then you feel compelled to turn around, and they're looking right at you.

388
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,730
That's our proprioception at work. So our proprioception says someone's here,

389
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,650
but our eyes say there isn't.

390
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,730
Yes, well, unlike Rachel,

391
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,070
when we're looking for something,

392
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,740
we rely on our vision.

393
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,930
But vision can be deceptive.

394
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,130
How many dots do you see? Two.

395
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,170
All right, now hold this with your right hand.

396
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,670
All right, close your left eye.

397
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,490
Look at this dot and move the paper slowly towards you.

398
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,230
One of the dots just disappeared. Into your blind spot.

399
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,590
You've all heard of one. We all have one.

400
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,280
It's a hole or gap in our visual landscape

401
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,570
which exists because of the way our brains are wired.

402
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,170
And we might be dealing with an Alpha who can exploit this phenomenon.

403
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,180
Okay, let's say that there is an Alpha here, right,

404
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,850
that does that-- how do they get into that gap? Bill, I don't know.

405
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,910
They might be able to send a signal that swells the optic nerves,

406
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,240
thereby expanding collectively the blind spot

407
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,060
and move into it so nobody can see them.

408
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,290
I still don't buy it. I mean, there's cameras everywhere.

409
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,510
An Alpha might be able to mess with our brain, but how does he get past the cameras?

410
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,810
The cameras are glitched. Someone's made them glitchy.

411
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,550
There's dropped frames and time lag. Enough to get around without being seen?

412
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,870
Yes, yes. But it's only our cameras.

413
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,300
It's only the cameras inside this building.

414
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,080
Yeah, the camera across the street

415
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,400
looks into this building every 15 minutes.

416
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,380
And that's why I won't go to the bathroom at three minutes after

417
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,560
or at 18 or 33 or 48, yeah. Gary, Gary, Gary, come on.

418
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,450
Okay, watch this.

419
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,830
Who is that woman? Wait. Who's that woman?

420
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,600
Hicks, behind you! Where'd she go?

421
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,730
I can't see her.

422
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,380
Cameron? Hicks, what happened?

423
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,370
I never even saw her. This isn't good. That's a lot of red.

424
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,050
Get a pressure bandage on that right away.

425
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,590
Come on, she's activating the blast door!

426
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,400
Password's been changed.

427
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,930
Well, all the phones aren't working either or the Internet.

428
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,070
Yeah, and Rachel's missing. Hicks is on the D.L.

429
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,720
Even if Cley gets here in time, he couldn't get in. Don't worry about that now.

430
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,950
Maybe Gary can override the lock system. That's worth a try.

431
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,000
Ah, stupid security glass!

432
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,700
Gary?

433
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,120
Gary, what are you doing? I'm using two chairs.

434
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,540
- Gary, no. - I tried one chair.

435
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,560
Now I'm using two. - Gary, Gary--

436
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,370
No, Dr. Rosen, I used one chair.

437
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,320
- I'm speaking to you, Gary. - Yeah, let me use the chairs.

438
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,420
I need your help. Will you come with me?

439
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,850
- I am helping. - Come with me, please.

440
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,190
It won't kill you,

441
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,810
but no bouncing off the ceilings for a few days, okay?

442
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,290
Well, I'm glad someone paid attention

443
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,260
during the first-aid class Harken made us take.

444
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,860
Okay, come on, come on. We got to find Rachel.

445
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,050
I'll get Rosen to give you some pain pills.

446
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,690
Addict.

447
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,530
Sorry.

448
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,590
Not good for you.

449
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,880
Don't care. 

450
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,250
that witch took my phone

451
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,210
- What witch? - The witch!

452
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,490
That's the word my mom uses when she's angry. She uses another word, too.

453
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,070
She took Rachel, and she took my phone.

454
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,560
The bitch got my gun.

455
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,460
- I think it's from-- - That sounded like my gun.

456
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,810
- Bulletproof glass... - Gary.

457
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,900
Excellent idea.

458
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,250
- It's crackly. - Gary.

459
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,020
Do you have my phone? Do you have Rachel?

460
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,300
Gary, Gary, I need you to see if you can get the computer systems back online.

461
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,580
- Don't leave his side. - Got it.

462
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,900
- Cameron. - Rachel--I'm on it.

463
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,310
- This just in my gut. - Hey, hey, where is she?

464
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,810
Where's blind spot girl?

465
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,250
You mean the person who just tried to shoot me? Or free you.

466
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,380
I say "day," you say "night."

467
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,900
We're never going to find common ground like this.

468
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,390
Yeah, you want common ground, why don't you start with a name?

469
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,000
Griffin.

470
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,650
Her name is Griffin, but I suspect it's a nom de guerre.

471
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,170
Red Flag considers her an unsanctioned variable.

472
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,140
What exactly does that mean?

473
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,850
Someone who sells their services to the highest bidder

474
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,200
but supports no cause, has no allegiance.

475
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,460
A person should believe in something, don't you think?

476
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,890
You two I respect. Even though you're wrong,

477
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,800
at least you're loyal to a cause greater than yourselves.

478
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,840
So you're saying that she's just a mercenary doing anything for money?

479
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,910
My ability can be extremely useful in finding her,

480
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,240
not to mention your missing compatriot, Rachel.

481
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,750
- Rachel, yes. - I don't think so.

482
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,320
Then you guys waltz out of here laughing your asses off.

483
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,220
Good try.

484
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,230
Does it look like I'm laughing? Griffin's after me.

485
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,910
She'll do whatever it takes to get me, including killing all of you.

486
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,310
Look, either you're a target, or you're an accomplice,

487
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,250
but either way, you're staying right where you are

488
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,040
until we hand you over to Cley.

489
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,340
Rachel.

490
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,400
The blast door-- I can't get it open.

491
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,360
Why do we always have to fight other people with abilities?

492
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,700
It's annoying.

493
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,930
I guess I'm not meant to be normal, huh? I'm sorry, Bill.

494
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,700
I hoped we'd have more time to talk, but--

495
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
you know, weigh the pros and cons

496
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,640
and let you have more time to make your own decision about this.

497
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,900
You know, when you used to talk to me like this, it used to make me cranky.

498
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,190
Well, I'm afraid it will again.

499
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,730
So the decision has been made for me.

500
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,740
How long's it take? Should take effect immediately.

501
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,900
All right, let's give this sucker a test-drive.

502
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,470
Come on, Bill. I can do this. I can do this.

503
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,030
You should be able to by now. The drugs should be kicking in.

504
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,960
Doc, it's not happening. It's not happening.

505
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,790
Look, I'm not sweating, right? My heart rate feels normal.

506
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm not feeling any rush or--

507
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,760
- Do you want to? - Of course I want to.

508
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,020
No, that's not what I'm asking you.

509
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,210
What are you saying? You think it's in my head?

510
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,160
Well, your ability to do this has always been linked to an emotional state of yours.

511
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,730
You can't have one without the other.

512
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,080
We are not gonna die because I can't get this up. Well, that should make you angry.

513
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,860
All right, all right, stop. Stop, stop.

514
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,220
Stop. Stop.

515
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
You can't do this, all right?

516
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,940
It's okay. Now, we can't find Rachel.

517
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,020
And I think we're going about this the wrong way.

518
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,280
I think we need to go on the offensive.

519
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,940
Are you sure this is going to work? That's it, break up the patterns.

520
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,210
The more abstract the background, the harder it should be for Griffin to blend in.

521
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,420
It's messy. I know Gary, but we're gonna clean it up, Gary, I promise.

522
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,310
Gary, move.

523
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,160
Gary, Gary, move, move.

524
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,300
I am. I am.

525
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,550
Gary, stay right here by-- sit down by that pillar.

526
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,370
Okay, camera's on.

527
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,100
Nina, be careful. You bleeding again?

528
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,470
No, it's fine.

529
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,540
We'll get Rosen to look at it, okay?

530
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,160
Over here. Look behind you.

531
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,780
She's running.

532
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,020
- There! - Where?

533
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,830
Footprints in the creamer.

534
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,840
Gary get in your office. Lock the door.

535
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,270
She's in the MRI room.

536
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,580
Nina, get back here. Where is she?

537
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,020
Where'd she go? It's a trap!

538
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,590
Bill, that door.

539
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,040
Oh my God, Gary. Gary?

540
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,050
Damn it, she's got us.

541
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,670
Gary! Gary! Open up, Gary!

542
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,060
Gary, get to your office and lock the door.

543
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,490
- Gary! - Okay.

544
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,100
Son of a bitch.

545
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,390
Gary! D.C.I.S. don't move!

546
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,910
Stop hiding. Come out.

547
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,380
Open up!

548
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,840
Stop hiding.

549
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,020
Okay, you're only making it worse for yourself.

550
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,690
Just please-- you have to stop hiding.

551
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,410
D.C.I.S. you're under arrest. Stop hiding!

552
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,520
D.C.I.S. you're under arrest now.

553
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,540
- Go to your office! - Please, stop.

554
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,350
You have to stop, please. Stop, please, don't!

555
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,600
- Hey! - No, no.

556
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,360
Oh, that felt so good.

557
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,450
Gary, are you okay?

558
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,290
So how do you do this--

559
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,960
fool our brains so we can't see you?

560
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,810
I've never given it much thought.

561
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,040
Why don't you cut me loose, and we can figure it out together?

562
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,030
I could even give you a demonstration if you'd like.

563
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,050
Didn't think so.

564
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,710
Kern referred to you as an unsanctioned variable.

565
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,410
I prefer Ronin.

566
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,130
Sounds cooler.

567
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,650
I mean, I've been following him for two weeks,

568
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,360
and then you lot scooped him up, so thanks for that.

569
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,510
Why don't you just let me take Kern and leave?

570
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,290
It's the easiest solution to your problem. Well, that's interesting.

571
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,910
He says we should release him to stop you, that you're our problem.

572
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,230
And you don't know who to believe, huh?

573
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,460
You seen your walls lately?

574
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,220
What are you talking about, the cracks?

575
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,520
Yeah, we noticed some cracks on the beams.

576
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,190
There are cracks everywhere.

577
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,720
You got a sonic Alpha in your holding cell.

578
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,430
He's trying to break out of here.

579
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,060
And he's been trying since the minute he woke up.

580
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,440
These vibrations, well...

581
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,740
They take time to build. Yeah, I don't trust her.

582
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,590
For all we know, she's working with Kern.

583
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,500
I'm sorry about the knife, handsome.

584
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,170
See, I don't like it when people get close to me.

585
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,350
I don't like it when they can see me either.

586
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,200
That's why Kern's so annoying--

587
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,170
the sonar. Who are you working for?

588
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,070
Let's just say it's someone that's interested in Kern's research.

589
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,000
His so-called vitamins?

590
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,810
Look, I get paid for delivering Kern's research,

591
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,100
which I've already gotten off your computers.

592
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,320
I get a bonus for bringing in Kern.

593
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,310
I can't do that if I'm dead.

594
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,450
Let's just call a truce. You let me take him out of here.

595
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,040
I get my fee.

596
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,700
You get to live. We all win.

597
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,590
Hicks.

598
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,290
Dr. Rosen, he's bleeding again.

599
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,600
Come with me.

600
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,300
Still bleeding. What's going on?

601
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,780
It's probably the vibrations.

602
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,490
It's okay. It's not like I'm dying or anything.

603
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,360
You don't want Doc here thinking you actually care about me.

604
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,100
Very funny.

605
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,060
Doc, Doc, take a look.

606
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,550
- Look. - Give me this.

607
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,770
Right there.

608
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,580
Oh, my goodness. I can hear the rumbles.

609
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,050
It's getting worse.

610
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,490
Doc.

611
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,230
Doc, I think you need to take a look at him.

612
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,490
I wasn't hurting anyone. Don't make me hurt you.

613
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,390
Whatever happens to us is gonna happen to you.

614
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,140
If you bring this whole building down--

615
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,590
All I wanted was to bring more Alphas into the world.

616
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,660
Why is that wrong? Why are you treating me like a criminal?

617
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,150
Bill, Bill, we've got to get inside there and stop him.

618
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,170
- Here, take this. - What is this?

619
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:09,990
Ether.

620
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,910
It's not elegant, but it's quick.

621
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,810
It's hot as hell.

622
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,180
He's turned the cell into a reverb chamber.

623
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,430
It's shaking the whole building, and it's creating heat.

624
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,200
The metal might be at the breaking point.

625
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,430
Dr. Rosen!

626
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,580
Duck and cover. Bill, duck and cover.

627
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,070
Gary? Gary, watch her.

628
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,840
Yeah, okay, I'll do both.

629
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,820
I'll watch, and I'll cover. I'll cover us.

630
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,350
He's lost too much blood. We got to get him out of here.

631
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,190
Hicks, come on, come on.

632
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,750
- Take him to the blast door. - Yeah.

633
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,270
I'll find Rosen.

634
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,850
Who hired you?

635
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,450
I was told to bring you in alive, but that's never gonna happen.

636
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,990
Who hired you?

637
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,180
It's too late!

638
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,140
So much for my bonus.

639
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,810
You know, a man with your abilities

640
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,620
could make a lot of money

641
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,780
if he went into business for himself.

642
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,600
That's never gonna happen. Yeah?

643
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,250
Well, I owe you one.

644
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,300
And I hate owing people.

645
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,470
So I'll pay you back.

646
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,470
Stanton Parish.

647
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,090
What the hell is that?

648
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,100
You better find out.

649
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,310
Who knew office work was so dangerous, huh?

650
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,390
Stanton Parish?

651
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,580
Yeah, yeah.

652
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,660
It was something that, uh, Griffin threw at me as a parting gift, I guess.

653
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,550
I don't know. Maybe it's a place, a person.

654
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,500
- I don't know. - Well, we'll look into it.

655
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,650
Yeah, well, the sooner the better, Doc.

656
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,770
I told you that we needed gun turrets, Bill.

657
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,990
You know what? I talked to your mother and asked her, could we fight Alphas in your bedroom?

658
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,920
And she said no. What's up with that?

659
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,760
That's not helpful, bill. My house would be the worst place to fight.

660
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,870
And anyway, my bedroom's off-limits. Gary, no, that's a great place.

661
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,440
I think, you know, we can keep them as prisoners there or--

662
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,460
Yeah, yeah, I know what you're trying to do, Bill.

663
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,340
You're trying to annoy me, but it's not gonna work.

664
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,060
You know, you were a lot less annoying when you didn't have your abilities.

665
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,110
And now that you've got your ability back, you're annoying again.

666
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,970
You're Bill again. You're the old Bill. You're damn right I am.

667
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,970
Nina, you don't have to clean up my office.

668
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,220
Yeah, well, don't want your wound to open up.

669
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,310
Rachel would smell blood-- I get it, you like me.

670
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,020
Don't be so, uh... Don't be so juvenile.

671
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,770
Come on, I saw how you reacted when I got cut.

672
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,840
I would've done the same thing to anyone.

673
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,000
Well, how about this?

674
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,650
Now, that's pretty grown-up, huh?

675
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,010
I don't care what Cley says.

676
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,700
This was a bad idea.

677
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,260
Yes, we do seem to be learning by trial and error.

678
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,580
Mostly error.

679
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,040
So no more prisoners in the office, right?

680
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,670
Oh, I certainly hope not, Rachel.

681
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,900
You know, you, uh, saved all of us--

682
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,550
dropping Griffin and detecting Kern's ability.

683
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,910
Just trying to earn my paycheck. I scanned the entire office.

684
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,880
There's no sign of Griffin. She got away.

685
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,990
And I'm assuming that she took the data on Kern's vitamins with her.

686
00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:00,350
She probably delivered it to her new employers, whoever they are.

687
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,570
Things aren't gonna get easier, are they?

688
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:11,270

1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,180
有一个红旗的可能成员来我们办公室了

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,400
Cameron说他和Nina已经制服了他

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
现在他们正要带他来这儿

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,610
我想Sullivan会来处理并评估

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,550
他是否是个阿尔法 或者跟红旗间有无联系

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,820
很显然事情不尽人意

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,790
所以我们还是不知道他有什么能力?

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,070
对

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,500
那么 还好我们来处理这件事了

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,720
19 68 16 7

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,570
这不是你的生日吧?

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,130
第三届超级杯

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,820
喷气机队16:7打败了小马队

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,830
是啊 但你当时还不够大去看比赛吧

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,960
我那时6个月

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,340
我见过我爸抱着我看比赛的照片

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,330
这样我就成了喷气机队一辈子的铁粉了

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,760
而且我们还会去的
去年我们玩的时候你看到了吧?

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,580
- 是啊 橄榄球 对吧 Bill? 
- 呃 算是吧 橄榄球

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,030
总之 我们装了防弹偏振玻璃

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,200
工业级电涌抑制器 防火泡沫

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,010
最妙的是我们还装了紧急禁闭装置
整个办公室

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,130
这样窗户 门 所有东西都被关上

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,290
现在我们就差国防部给我们买辆新车了 

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,370
他们能买吗?

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,290
哦 天 Bill 我不知道

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,010
这比我以前为咱们设想的过界太多了

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,560
医生 你得克服这个观念
我们不再只是你的病人了

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,750
我们还是一个政府资产

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,150
那句话怎么说来着
在苍白的月色下与魔鬼共舞?

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,770
你得顺其自然 好吗
这不是你经常对我说的吗?

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,560
听着 自从Jonas Englin的那个烂摊子后

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
我失去了我的能力 我还在这儿 对吧
我很满意现状 你也很满意 所以...

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,320
不 我也不是那么满意的 这不是原来的你

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,440
而国防部也不太满意

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,620
事实上 我正试着找出能让你能力恢复的办法

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,330
你是一个很好的调查员 但在政府眼里

38
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,190
我们是一组阿尔法

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,880
可你也不是阿尔法啊 你不还在这儿 对不?

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,830
- 而且 医生... 
- 呃?

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,030
Jeannie和我打算重装厨房

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,490
- 所以拜托支票一定不能断
- 这不行

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,860
这不行 他们不顾我的清单 我做了一个清单

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,130
睡气喷射器 心灵感应阻断器 还有自动炮塔

45
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,620
- Gary 这些东西都不存在
- 是啊 我喜欢以前的Bill多一点

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,260
那时你会认真地考虑问题

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,510
而当事情不对时 你的静脉就会爆出来
现在就不对

48
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,810
- 为什么你的静脉不再爆出来了
- 我不用再担心这事了

49
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,250
那为什么你还在这儿 你已经不是一个阿尔法了

50
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,160
如果我不在这儿 你会想我的 对不对?

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,860
你离开跟你改变是一回事

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,670
随便吧 Bill 随你便

53
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,290
我来处理

54
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,040
你们听到我了吗 这是什么噪声?

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,340
检查 完毕? Bill 收到吗?

56
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,390
呃 Rachel 这不是警用通信

57
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,710
- 你可以正常说话
- 好吧 我听到他们了

58
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,950
- 他们跟Kern医生一起在电梯里
- 好的 谢谢

59
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,650
抱歉了

60
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,980
能确认跟红旗之间的联系吗?

61
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,670
我们刚坐下他就起疑了

62
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,010
那阿尔法能力呢?

63
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,920
我想要催眠他 但不成功

64
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
我想先做磁共振成像检测

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,050
接着我们再把他关进牢房里

66
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,170
在他醒过来前赶紧行动吧

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,920
医生 你还好吗?

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,730
呃 还好 只是...

69

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,810
请不要把他弄醒

73
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,530
放松 Rachel 你知道我还有枪的

74
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,130
我没激动时 准头更好

75
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,220
你知道吗 Bill 我在想

76
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,250
如果我跟你注射肾上腺素和类固醇的混合药物

77
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,040
- 我们也许可以助启你的能力
- 医生 我不想这么做

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,030
那个能力总给我惹麻烦 好吗
婚姻的麻烦 工作的麻烦还有...

79
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,070
- 不 我理解你的担心 
- 谁需要这种能力呢?

80
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,660
我们可能需要

81
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,080
我们都有自己的麻烦
但我们都在学习如何掌控它们

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,210
是啊 现在我一切都尽在掌握中 多谢了

83
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,100
好吧 看看我们找到些什么

84
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,360
报告都做好了 天 你真够积极的

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,340
我曾试着忽略它 假装它会消失
但它从未消失过

86
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,470
奶油 不加糖 对不对?

87
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,380
我有留意的

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,860
- 我在想是谁把我们的事向Kern告的密
- Guy是个产科医生

89
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,060
他总是见到幸福的一对对
我猜他看不到我们之间的幸福

90
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,690
怎么 我们不能做幸福的一对吗?

91
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,520
不 我不会这么说

92
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,100
Rosen觉得这是个不好的想法

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,440
我和你

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,980
等等 你告诉他了?

95
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,600
他是我们的心理医生啊

96
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,200
为什么 是不是因为...

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,460
因为我离过婚 还在戒酒?

98
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,140
或者是因为我有个小孩

99
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,890
我们在一起工作 这样不专业的

100
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,270
不 我们做这份工作时经常会做些不专业的事
你也知道的

101
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,590
不是这个原因

102
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,730
他认为我对你有坏影响

103
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,160
而且...

104
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,680
他可能是对的

105
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,530
Cam 我搞糟了从前的每一次恋爱

106
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,550
我也是

107
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,940
那我们是绝配咯

108
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,800
嘿 伙计们

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,040
呃 医生发现了一些事 我们要开个会

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,720
好 我们马上去

111
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,130
- Kern怎么会是瞎的呢?
- 因为他没有视神经

112
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,730
核磁共振展示出了一些非常有意思的事

113
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,130
就好像它们从未发育过一样
所以 即使他的眼睛发育良好

114
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,340
看起来也是如此
但任何视觉数据都无法抵达他的大脑

115
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,870
这就是为什么我无法催眠他 他看不见我

116
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,630
听着 当情况有变时
那男人在桌边闪躲 还直冲到门那边

117
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,780
他不可能是瞎的

118
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,930
除非他是个阿尔法 我对此有些想法

119
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,790
不过我还需要做更多测试

120
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,880
所以我们是在谈一个婴儿医生的盲阿尔法
还可能是红旗一员?

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,610
我的电话呢 谁拿了我的电话?

122
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,940
Bill? Bill! Bill!

123
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,890
Gary 我一直在这儿 你在说什么呢?

124
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,520
- 是吗 你把我手机放哪儿了
- Gary 我一直都在你面前

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,290
- Gary 你的手机在这儿
- 哦 好吧 这是不对的

126
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,550
人们不该碰我的手机 这是份礼物 这很特别

127
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,880
对 好啦 手机已经回到你手上了 

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,530
- 没事了
- 不 有事 因为数据文件被打开了 这都是私人资料

129
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,370
是的 Gary的手机是私人物品
请大家都不要碰它 除非得到Gary的许可 好吗?

130
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,850
没错 而且我不会许可的

131
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,350
再说回我们的案子
Kern医生在这儿的原因是...

132
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,860
国防部怀疑他在做某种研究

133
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,440
他们希望我们能找出原因

134
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,320
而且说实话吧 一个激进的阿尔法

135
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,160
同时还是名产科医生 光这个想法就让人不安了

136
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,290
我们清查了他的办公室 硬盘 手机 病人文件

137
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,940
药物 维生素 血液样本

138
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,940
- Rachel 你来看看这些吧
- 好 好极了

139
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,260
Gary 你来查手机和电脑传输?

140
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,880
那是大海捞针 没超能力的人也可以做这个

141
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,580
是啊 你知道的 我们不全能做这事

142
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,240
- 我就做不到 Gary
- 我也不能

143
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,630
不 我们都知道除了超能力外
你还有很多优点 Gary

144
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,500
- 你有很多天赋
- 我知道 我超赞的

145
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,380
今天有得忙了

146
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,730
Gary?

147
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,370
喂?

148
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,520
喂?

149
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,590
谁在那儿?

150
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,190
你在叫我吗 我在工作

151
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,040
我的IM聊天状态上写着 勿扰

152
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,110
我该写个牌子的

153
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,480
- 嘿 Gary 你刚去过我办公室吗
- Rachel 你在胡言乱语

154
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,650
我跟你说了 我在工作

155
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,450
我在我办公室工作

156
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,520
- Bill 你能拿掉那堵口带吗
- 你确定?

157
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,510
是的 我拿到我需要的测试结果了

158
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,000
我只想跟他谈谈

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,540
好吧 随便你

160
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,660
让我来告诉你 幸福是一支温暖的枪

161
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,140
而我的就是一支西格226 你明白吗?

162
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,490
- 我要找律师
- 是吗 我还想要个鲁宾三明治呢

163
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,180
我会让我的律师给你带一个的

164
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,450
不幸的是 Kern医生 你被拘留

165
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,380
是因为涉嫌参与一个恐怖组织

166
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,080
我所在的唯一组织就是美国医学协会

167
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,120
那什么阿尔法 超能力 红旗

168
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,770
这些词对你来说都没有意义吗?

169
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,390
Bill 你能把那些手铐解开吗

170
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,900
让他站起来 让他的脸对着镜子?

171
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,100
慢慢站起来 手举起来

172
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,890
请转身 对着墙

173
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,000
这是什么意思 检查虫牙啊?

174
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,880
只是我的一个想法...

175
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,730
声纳 回波定位

176
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,730
- 所以说他就像是只蝙蝠
- 或者是一条海豚

177
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,640
你现在可以坐下了

178
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,810
很有意思 你没有视神经

179
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,810
但是 你大脑的音频处理能力

180
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,940
你的喉头

181
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,880
你窦通道的空间

182
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,480
都显著地有所提高 你是个阿尔法

183
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,760
- 当然你已经知道了
- 这事不会有好结果的

184
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,140
这是个威胁吗?

185
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,770
嘿 Cley Rosen和我要继续研究他

186
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,980
Rachel正在查看我们在他办公室找到的东西

187
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,740
是啊 Rosen认为他大概不会再说什么了

188
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,380
所以你们来带走他吧?

189
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,680
好的 两小时?

190
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,510
从Knoxville?

191
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,440
好的 祝你航班顺利哈

192
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,420
- 医生 我们能谈谈吗
- 我有点忙 Cameron 我们能...

193
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,910
不 就一会

194
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,670
听着 我只想说 我和Nina...

195
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,030
如果你能给我们一点空间

196
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,070
让我们自己去理清我们俩的事...

197
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,070
我只是想照看好你们俩人

198
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,180
我明白 但我们都是成年人了

199
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,290
我们得自己犯错 所以拜托 不要插手

200
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,250
我很想 但作为你们的心理医生和雇主

201
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,170
我想我不能这么做

202
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,760
而且我也不认为该由你做这个决定

203
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,210
我打扰你们了吗 我总是打扰人

204
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,320
对不起 但我在箱子里找到些东西

205
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,690
很重要

206
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,120
看这些

207
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,640
"为更好的宝宝而建"

208
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,110
是的 这是给怀孕妇女的维生素

209
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,610
我决定打开一个 看看里面 你明白的
真正地看一看

210
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,630
Rachel 你发现什么了?

211
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,730
DNA...

212
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,740
维生素里面有活性人类DNA

213
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,510
活性人类DNA

214
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,060
注入正在发育中的胎儿的话

215
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,400
会引起多种生产缺陷 严重的突变

216
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,430
是啊 这就是我所担心的

217
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,240
等等 我闻到血的味道...

218
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,690
在走廊里

219
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,560
- Nina
- 刚开始流

220
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,570
我长大之后就再没流过鼻血了

221
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,830
哦 天 往上看 你头晕吗?

222
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,990
- 不 还好
- 有头痛或者其他感觉吗?

223
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,890
只不过破了几条毛细血管

224
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,200
不严重 可你是在挖鼻孔吗?

225
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,690
我不做这事的

226
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,780
来 拿着这个

227
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,550
你会好的 擦干净吧?

228
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,330
好 没事

229
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,500
你知道你有二尖瓣脱垂吗

230
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,800
有三毫米的移位?

231
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,650
你刚给我的胸部做了个超声波

232
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,300
你该去检查下

233
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,710
我每年都会做两次心脏检查的

234
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,780
我在监控它 不过 ...

235
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,060
还是谢谢你的关心了

236
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,230
跟你也一样 我也发过誓...

237
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,960
不害人

238
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,790
- 我也许是个阿尔法 但我首先是个医生
- 我希望你谨记这个想法

239
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,240
不害人

240
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,360
什么样的医生会给怀孕妇女

241
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,110
注入活性人类DNA?

242
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,460
关心未来的人

243
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,970
谁的未来?

244
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,760
你知道Renestrin

245
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,230
那个据说可以抑制生育缺陷的新药吧?

246
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,610
但它实际的作用是

247
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,450
阻碍有更多进化孩子的胚胎发展

248
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,840
你真正想说的是 它阻止了阿尔法的出生吧

249
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,180
把我的特殊维生素想成反作用剂

250
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,340
你计划一个人来分发

251
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,010
你的反作用剂吗?

252
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,660
你的组员有会读心的吗?

253
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,800
那我想 有些事就不会有答案了

254
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,720
Rosen医生 我知道下一步会发生什么

255
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,160
拿着枪的人会把我押送到某个政府建筑里

256
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,500
那将是一个非常非常悲剧的错误

257
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,950
我想真正的悲剧

258
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,140
恐怕是你选择加入一个恐怖组织

259
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,770
红旗并不像你以为的是个庞大的机构

260
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,160
先不说它的范围 你和你的朋友还想要暗杀我

261
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,340
边缘因素 激进派 并不能代表主流

262
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,810
你知道吗 很有意思的是 人们常常使用这个词

263
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,680
"边缘因素"

264
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,440
在我看来 爱尔兰共和军

265
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,200
巴解组织 3K党

266
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,070
所有这些边缘因素

267
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,540
他们的存在都有赖于

268
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,440
他们主流同伴的支持

269
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,270
我读过你的外勤报告 医生

270
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,510
你主张阿尔法和普通人类合作

271
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,750
共建美好未来

272
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,290
这也是我想要的未来

273
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,410
我们本该一起工作 互相学习

274
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,220
你在邀请我加入红旗吗?

275
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,040
恐怕我达不到他们的入门要求吧

276
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,140
我能够预见不久的将来

277
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,770
没有超能力的人也能加入我们的大业

278
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,810
那才是你该待的地方

279
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,250
Kern医生 如果你愿意确切地说出

280
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,270
你想要干什么

281
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,090
我很乐意代表你调停此事

282
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,360
死局

283
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,380
我对你很失望 医生

284
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
这个嘛...

285
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,020
我不是要去Binghamton的人

286
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,610
你又怎么会认为去的是我?

287
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,500
Bill? Hicks?

288
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,630
拜托 伙计们 这最好不是在跟我开玩笑

289
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,240
这家伙嘴真紧啊

290
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,800
有办法撬开他的嘴么?

291
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,040
- 像个音速小子
- 是啊

292
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,630
我们该放Captain & Tennille的歌给他听听

293
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,240
麝鼠之爱

294
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,330
- 音速战争
- 嗯

295
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,570
这可是工作中的惯用手法

296
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,860
记住 我们逼他听的东西 我们自己也听得到

297
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,910
相信我 对付巴格拉姆的囚犯我们也这么干过

298
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,210
每次听到科帕卡瓦纳 我还是觉得恶心

299
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,480
- 不过我喜欢那首歌
- 得了吧

300
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,520
真的啊 是我最喜欢的

301
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,730
听见什么了么? Gary又在鼓捣电脑了?

302
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,510
我登不进系统了

303
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,920
好像在进行按键恢复

304
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,140
- 看见Rachel了么?
- 没见过

305
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,990
她不在办公室 有个把钟头都没人看见她了

306
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,250
要不你把她吼出来?

307
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,760
我吼过了 好不好 她不见了

308
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,890
- Rachel? 
- Rachel?

309
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,360
- Rachel 听见的话就吱一声
- 啥都没有 啥都没有

310
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,390
监视器出问题了

311
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,260
Gary 过来 让我看看你发现了什么

312
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,510
- 接到监视器上
- 好吧 出故障了

313
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,990
回放一小时前Rachel办公室的录像

314
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,540
有东西干扰了监视器

315
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,280
好吧 她在那

316
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,350
在办公室里检查Kern的东西

317
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,610
能快进么?

318
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,100
虽然出故障了 不过应该可以快进

319
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,900
好吧 等等 看这 她走了

320
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,100
等等 找到她了

321
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,710
20分钟前 看这里

322
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,840
在那

323
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,870
Hicks! Nina!

324
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,070
你待在这 跟我来

325
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,010
Rachel!

326
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,360
Rachel?

327
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,960
Rachel 你在哪?

328
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,950
这是监视器最后捕捉到她的地方吧?

329
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,410
- 是的
- Rachel!

330
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,630
- 天啊
- 咋了?

331
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,850
过来

332
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,450
是血

333
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,190
- 这里也有血
- 像是被拖走的痕迹

334
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,860
- 从那里开始拖
- 不 是从这里

335
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,920
她不可能就这么人间蒸发了 搞什么?

336
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,320
Rachel 你在哪? Rachel?

337
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,960
嘿 看看这个

338
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,780
我们搬进来的时候就这样么?

339
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,410
你干了什么?

340
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,050
- Rachel在哪? 
- Rachel?

341
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,650
谁是Rachel 高个子的?

342
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,100
- 另一个女人 
- 可我见都没见过

343
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,530
你的声纳能力肯定不止找东西

344
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,140
可我被铐在这里了啊

345
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,310
难道我能靠声音绑架别人?

346
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,870
还有 我的听力很好

347
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,930
从我醒过来到现在 这层楼里的心跳声一个没少

348
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,480
那你听到几个心跳声?

349
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,740
你非要跟我玩这么无聊的游戏?

350
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,480
八个 一直是八个心跳声

351
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,000
你的 我的 还有六个我估计是你手下的

352
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,510
尽管你都还没介绍我认识

353
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,110
Kern医生 我们只有六个人 包括Rachel和我

354
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,240
加你 也不过七个

355
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,370
什么?

356
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,010
有没有...

357
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,450
你办公室有没有丢什么东西...

358
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,360
或者听到什么奇怪的声音

359
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,380
电脑无缘无故开机

360
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,300
或者感觉到身边有人 却看不到?

361
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,490
这里来了个不速之客

362
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,890
你是说

363
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,170
Rachel被人绑架了

364
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,010
而绑架她的人还在这幢楼里?

365
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,010
让我来解决 我帮你 不然我们都得死

366
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,860
- 我干嘛要相信你说的? 
- 好啊 那就别信

367
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,420
不过你队伍里已经挂了一个了

368
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,040
不听我的 事情只会更糟

369
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,200
让我出去!

370
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,940
趁现在还来得及 让我出去!

371
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,320
你们必须放我出去 只有我能救大家

372
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,840
不用听他的 我一点都不相信他

373
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,010
我把整个办公室搜了个遍 还是找不到Rachel

374
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,740
除了听Kern的 我们别无他法

375
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,500
最好Cley现在就来 把这家伙带走

376
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,150
得等我们把Rachel找到再说

377
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,180
嗯 我觉得我们至少应该判断下Kern说的话

378
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,030
如果真有人潜入 那么发生的一切倒也说得通

379
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,960
医生 今天早些时候
我当时还以为是我的幻觉

380
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,930
我感觉有人在监视我

381
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,940
- 我回过头却发现根本没人
- 正是如此 Bill

382
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,990
这是一种本体感受

383
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,080
是我们的身体处理身边无数信息的

384
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,390
一种方式

385
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,550
就像你说的 如果你置身于一间都是人的房间
你可以感觉到什么

386
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,810
然后你不由自主地转过头 发现有人正看着你

387
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,730
- 这就是因为本体感受
- 那么本体感受说真有人在这

388
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,650
而眼睛却说没有?

389
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,730
差不多吧 和Rachel不同

390
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,070
当我们感受某样东西

391
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,740
我们靠的是视觉

392
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,930
但视觉有时候靠不住

393
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,130
- 你看到几个点?
- 两个

394
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,170
好的 现在你用右手拿着它

395
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,670
闭上左眼

396
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,490
盯着这个点看 慢慢把纸移向你

397
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,230
- 有个点不见了
- 被视觉盲点屏蔽了

398
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,590
你们都听说过盲点 每个人都有

399
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,280
因为视神经在视网膜前穿过

400
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,570
使得视网膜上出现感光缺口

401
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,170
而我们可能碰上了个能利用这点的阿尔法

402
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,180
那好 假设这里真有这么个阿尔法

403
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,850
- 他又是怎么利用盲点的呢?
- Bill 我也不知道

404
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,910
可能是发出一个扩大视神经的信号

405
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,240
借此放大盲点的范围

406
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,060
藏身其中 不被发现

407
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,290
我还是不敢相信 要知道 到处都是探头

408
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,510
阿尔法也许能骗过人 监视器总没办法了吧?

409
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,810
监视器坏了 被人弄坏了

410
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,550
- 有严重的失帧和延迟
- 严重到看都看不到?

411
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,870
是的 不过只有我们的监视器有问题

412
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,300
只是这幢楼里的监视器

413
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,080
街道旁的监视器

414
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,400
每隔15分钟就会扫我们的楼

415
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,380
所以三分钟后我不会去上厕所

416
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,560
- 或者是18 33 或者48分钟后
- Gary Gary Gary 行了

417
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,450
看看这个

418
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,830
等等 这女人是谁

419
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,600
- Hicks 在你背后!
- 跑哪去了?

420
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,730
我看不到她

421
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,380
- Cameron
- Hicks 怎么了?

422
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,370
我都看不到她在哪 情况不妙 好多血

423
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,050
马上拿绷带包住伤口

424
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,590
她关上了隔离门!

425
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,400
密码改了

426
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,930
电话和网络都用不了了

427
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,070
好吧 Rachel失踪 Hicks又受伤

428
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,720
- 就算Cley赶得上 他也进不来
- 不用担心

429
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,950
- Gary应该能破解屏蔽系统
- 值得一试

430
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,000
啊 操蛋的防弹玻璃!

431
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,700
Gary?

432
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,120
- Gary你在干嘛? 
- 这次我用两张椅子砸

433
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,540
- Gary 住手
- 刚才我用一张椅子

434
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,560
- 现在用俩
- Gary Gary

435
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,370
不要 Rosen医生 我刚才只用了一张椅子

436
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,320
- 我在跟你说话 Gary
- 让我用两张砸

437
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,420
我需要你帮忙 跟我来好么?

438
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,850
- 我在帮忙
- 来吧

439
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,190
虽然不会致命

440
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,810
不过这几天最好别伸展摸天花板什么的

441
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,290
以前总是Harken负伤

442
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,260
这次我终于也享受被护理的待遇了

443
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,860
好了 行了 我们得去找Rachel

444
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,050
我让Rosen给你弄点药

445
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,690
会上瘾的

446
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,530
不好意思

447
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,590
这样对你不好

448
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,880
我不在乎

449
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,250
那巫婆偷了我的手机

450
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,210
- 什么巫婆?
- 就是那个巫婆!

451
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,490
我妈生气了就会说这个词
有时候也会改个字母(bitch)

452
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,070
带走了Rachel 还拿了我手机

453
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,560
那婊子还拿了我的枪

454
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,460
- 好像是从... 
- 听上去像是我的枪

455
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,810
- 防弹玻璃... 
- Gary

456
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,900
明智之举

457
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,250
- 要碎了 
- Gary

458
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,020
你拿了我的手机? 带走了Rachel?

459
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,300
Gary Gary 去把电脑系统修好

460
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,580
- 盯着他
- 收到

461
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,900
- Cameron 找Rachel
- 交给我了

462
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,310
- 真是我肚子里的蛔虫
- 嘿 她跑哪去了?

463
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,810
盲点女去哪了?

464
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,250
- 你说那个刚对我开枪的人? 
- 或者是想放你走的人

465
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,380
我说鸡 你说鸭

466
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,900
我们永远不可能达成相同意见

467
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,390
想要意见相同 不如你先告诉我们她叫什么?

468
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,000
Griffin

469
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,650
她叫Griffin 不过估计不是真名

470
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,170
红旗组织定义其为编外人员

471
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,140
什么意思?

472
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,850
为高报酬才接单行动

473
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,200
但并不隶属于组织

474
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,460
人要有信仰 你觉得呢?

475
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,890
我尊重你们俩 虽然你们误入了歧途

476
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,800
至少你们效忠的原因是伟大的

477
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,840
你是说 她不过是个为钱卖命的雇佣兵?

478
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,910
我的能力对于找到她至关重要

479
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,240
更不要说找你们的伙伴 Rachel

480
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,750
- Rachel 对
- 我可不这么想

481
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,320
然后你们得意洋洋 大摇大摆地走出这里

482
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,220
想得美

483
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,230
我看上去像在耍你们? Griffin是来找我的

484
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,910
为了抓住我她会不择手段
包括把你们全杀了

485
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,310
你不是目标 就是帮凶

486
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,250
不管你是什么 都给我待在这里

487
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,040
直到我们把你交给Cley

488
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,340
Rachel

489
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,400
隔离门 我打不开

490
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,360
为什么我们老是要和些有超能力的人干架?

491
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,700
真蛋疼

492
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,930
- 我永远都做不了正常人 是么?
- 不好意思 Bill

493
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,700
我希望我们能有更多时间聊聊 不过...

494
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
权衡利弊

495
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,640
我也希望你能自己做决定

496
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,900
你以前这么跟我说话的时候
我都会觉得很怪

497
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,190
恐怕以后这机会不少

498
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,730
看来我还是"被决定"了

499
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,740
- 多久起效?
- 应该很快

500
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,900
好吧 我来找那家伙过过招

501
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,470
- 用力 Bill
- 我可以的 我可以的

502
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,030
现在你应该可以了 药物应该生效了

503
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,960
医生 不行 我不行

504
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,790
瞧 我满头大汗 心率又很正常

505
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,080
而且也没觉得兴奋或者...

506
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,760
- 你很想?
- 当然想了

507
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,020
我问的不是这个

508
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,210
那是什么? 还是你觉得我没尽全力?

509
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,160
你的能力和你的情绪状态息息相关

510
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,730
两者缺一不可

511
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,080
- 我不把门打开 我们都得死
- 这样想你会发怒的

512
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,860
好了 停下吧

513
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,220
停 停

514
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
你抬不起来的

515
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,940
没关系 暂时我们找不到Rachel了

516
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,020
我们可能想错办法了

517
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,280
应该先进攻

518
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,940
- 你觉得这会有用? 
- 嗯 喷得越乱越好

519
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,210
背景越抽象 Griffin就越难融入

520
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,420
- 乱七八糟的
- 我知道 Gary 不过之后我们会打扫干净的 我保证

521
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,310
行动 Gary

522
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,160
Gary Gary 行动 动起来

523
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,300
我在 我在做

524
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,550
Gary 就呆在那...坐到柱子旁边

525
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,370
好的 摄像头开了

526
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,100
- Nina 小心点
- 你又流血了?

527
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,470
不 没关系

528
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,540
我们让Rosen来看看好么?

529
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,160
这里 小心身后

530
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,780
她在跑

531
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,020
- 那里!
- 哪里?

532
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,830
乳酪上有足迹

533
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,840
Gary 进你办公室去 锁好门

534
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,270
她在核磁共振室里

535
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,580
- Nina 回来
- 她在哪?

536
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,500
她去了哪?

537
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,020
这是个陷阱!

538
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,590
Bill 那扇门

539
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,040
哦我的天啊 Gary Gary?

540
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,050
该死的 她骗过我们了

541
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,670
Gary! Gary! 打开来 Gary!

542
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,060
Gary 去办公室 把门锁上

543
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,490
- Gary!
- 好啦

544
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,100
狗娘养的

545
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,390
- Gary!
- 我们是DCIS 不要动!

546
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,910
不要躲了 快出来

547
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,380
开门!

548
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,840
别再躲了

549
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,020
好了 你只是在让自己更不利而已

550
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,690
拜托 你真的别再躲了

551
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,410
我们是DCIS
你已经被逮捕了 别躲了!

552
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,520
我们是DCIS 你被逮捕了

553
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,540
- 去你的办公室!
- 拜托 停下

554
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,350
你必须停止 拜托 停下 拜托 不要!

555
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,600
- 嘿!
- 不 不

556
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,360
哦 这感觉真好

557
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,450
Gary 你还好么?

558
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,290
那你是怎么做到的...

559
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,960
瞒过我们的大脑让我们看不见你的?

560
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,810
我从来没多想过这个问题

561
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,040
为什么不帮我松绑
让我们一起来探究一下呢?

562
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,030
如果你愿意的话我甚至能展示给你看

563
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,050
看来你不同意

564
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,710
Kern称你为编外人员

565
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,410
我更喜欢被称为Ronin

566
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,130
听起来比较酷

567
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,650
我已经跟着他两周了

568
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,360
然后你们就把他接手了 真是谢谢了

569
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,510
你怎么就不能让我带上Kern离开呢?

570
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,290
- 这是解决你问题最简单的办法
- 这挺有趣的

571
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,910
他说我们应该释放他来阻止你
你就是我们的问题

572
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,230
你不知道能信任谁 是么?

573
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,460
你最近看过你的墙壁么?

574
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,220
你在说什么 那些裂缝?

575
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,520
是的 我们注意到梁上有些裂缝

576
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,190
到处都有裂缝

577
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,720
你的牢房里关着一个音速阿尔法

578
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,430
他正在试图逃出去

579
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,060
从他醒来的那一刻起一直在尝试

580
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,440
这些震动...

581
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,740
- 可是需要花时间的
- 哦 我不信任她

582
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,590
我们都知道 她和Kern是一伙的

583
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,500
小帅哥 那一刀我很抱歉

584
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,170
你看 我不喜欢别人离我太近

585
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,350
我也不喜欢他们能够看见我

586
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,200
声纳...这就是为什么Kern很烦人

587
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,170
你是谁的手下?

588
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,070
可以说是对Kern的研究感兴趣的某个人

589
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,000
他所谓的维他命?

590
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,810
我只是收钱把Kern的研究送过去

591
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,100
我已经从你的电脑里找到了

592
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,320
如果我把Kern送过去还会有奖金

593
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,310
但如果我死了就拿不到了

594
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,450
我们谈个条件吧 你让我把他带走

595
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,040
我拿到我的钱

596
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,700
你们留下你们的命 双赢

597
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,590
Hicks

598
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,290
Rosen医生 他又流血了

599
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,600
跟我来

600
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,300
还在流血 发生什么了?

601
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,780
可能是因为震动

602
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,490
没事的 又不是说我快死了什么的

603
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,360
你不想让医生认为你真的在关心我吧

604
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,100
真有趣

605
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,060
医生 医生 看一下

606
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,550
- 看
- 给我这个

607
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,770
就在那

608
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,580
- 天啊
- 我都能听见隆隆声了

609
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,050
越来越严重了

610
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,490
医生

611
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,230
医生 我觉得你该看看他

612
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,490
我没伤害任何人 别逼我伤害你

613
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,390
不论我们发生了什么 你也一样

614
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,140
你要是把整栋楼都弄塌了...

615
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,590
我只是想让世界上有更多的阿尔法

616
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,660
这有什么错? 干嘛弄得我像罪犯似的?

617
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,150
Bill Bill 我们要进去阻止他

618
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,170
- 给 带上这个
- 这是什么?

619
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:09,990
乙醚

620
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,910
可能不太光彩 不过很有效

621
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,810
烫死了

622
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,180
他把牢房变成混响室了

623
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,430
整个房子都在颤 还在产生热量

624
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,200
金属快断了

625
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,430
Rosen医生!

626
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,580
卧倒掩护 Bill 卧倒掩护

627
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,070
Gary? Gary 照顾好她

628
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,840
好 没问题 两样我都能做好

629
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,820
我会照顾她 我也会掩护 我能掩护我们

630
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,350
他失血过多了 我们得带他出去

631
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,190
Hicks 起来 加油

632
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,750
- 把他带到屏蔽门那儿去
- 好

633
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,270
我去找Rosen

634
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,850
谁雇你的?

635
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,450
本来我该把你活着带去的 但不可能了

636
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,990
谁雇你的?

637
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,180
太迟了!

638
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,140
我的奖金这下没了

639
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,810
你知道 一个拥有你这样能力的人

640
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,620
是能赚很多钱的

641
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,780
如果他能好好开发自己的话

642
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,600
- 绝不可能
- 是么?

643
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,250
好吧 我欠你份人情

644
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,300
而我很讨厌欠别人

645
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,470
所以我会回报你

646
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,470
Stanton Parish

647
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,090
什么意思?

648
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,100
你最好查出来

649
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,310
谁能想到办公室工作也能这么危险呢?

650
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,390
Stanton Parish?

651
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,580
没错 是的

652
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,660
Griffin给我的什么临别礼物 我猜

653
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,550
不知道 也许是个地方 也许是个人

654
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,500
- 我不知道
- 我们会去调查的

655
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,650
好的 越快越好 医生

656
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,770
Bill 我跟你说过我们需要炮塔

657
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,990
你知道么? 我和你妈妈谈过
并且问她我们能不能在你房间与阿尔法斗争?

658
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,920
她说不行 这为什么?

659
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,760
没用的 Bill 我的房子不适合

660
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,870
- 再说 我的卧室是禁地
- Gary 别 那地方棒极了

661
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,440
我觉得我们能把他们
作为犯人一直关在那或者...

662
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,460
好了 好了 我明白你的小心思 Bill

663
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,340
你在试图烦我 但没用的

664
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,060
你知道 你失去能力之后一点都不烦人

665
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,110
但现在你重新获得能力了
就又开始烦人了

666
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,970
- 你又是Bill了 原来的那个Bill
- 你说的太他妈对了

667
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,970
Nina 你没必要清理我的办公室

668
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,220
是的 我只是不想你的伤口又裂开

669
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,310
- Rachel会闻到血的味道的...
- 我明白了 你喜欢我

670
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,020
别这么 呃...别幼稚了

671
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,770
得了 我受伤的时候看到你有多紧张了

672
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,840
谁受伤了我都这样

673
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,000
那这个怎么解释?

674
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,650
这够成熟了哈?

675
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,010
我不在乎Cley怎么说

676
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,700
这可不是好主意

677
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,260
是的 我们似乎总是
从实验和错误中吸取经验

678
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,580
大部分是错误

679
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,040
所以不再把犯人放办公室了吧?

680
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,670
我当然希望不了 Rachel

681
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,900
你知道 你 呃 救了我们大家...

682
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,550
干倒Griffin 发现Kern的能力

683
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,910
只是混口饭吃罢了 我检查了整个办公室

684
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,880
没有Griffin的迹象 她走了

685
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,990
我猜她还带走了Kern的维他命上的数据

686
00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:00,350
也许带去给她的新雇主了吧 管他是谁

687
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,570
总是没法省心 不是么?

688
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:11,270
