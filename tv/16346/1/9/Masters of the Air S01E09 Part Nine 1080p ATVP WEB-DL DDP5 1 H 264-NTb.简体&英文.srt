00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,710
- 快 巴克 快跑 - 站住
- Go, Buck. Get out of here. - Halt!

270
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,680
放了那个人 立刻
Release that man. Now.

271
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,980
放了他
Let him go.

272
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,730
该死的 你们敢动他一根汗毛 战俘们就会暴动
Goddamn it. You touch one hair on his head, and you'll have a riot.

273
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,360
格兰尼茨
Glemnitz.

274
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,690
这是我的高级军官之一 他是至关重要的...
This is one of my senior officers, and he is essential to--

275
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,200
中士 命令你的人放了伊根少校
Sergeant, order your man to release Major Egan.

276
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,030
立刻
Now.

277
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,560
怎么回事
The hell was that all about?

278
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,060
乔治 比尔和巴克翻过了那堵墙
George, Bill and Buck, they went over that wall.

279
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
听见了吗
You hear that?

280
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,130
听起来像通用的车
Sounds like GMCs.

281
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,130
看起来他们在撤退
Looks like they're retreating.

282
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,550
死猪
Pig!

283
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,180
求求你
Please.

284
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,190
求求你
Please.

285
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,940
滚
Go!

286
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,440
滚
Go.

287
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,950
小混蛋
Fucking kids.

288
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,890
我们得走了 巴克
We gotta go, Buck.

289
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
巴克
Buck.

290
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,070
他们连子弹都没有
They didn't even have any goddamn bullets.

291
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
走吧
Let's go.

292
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,970
他来了 他还活着
There he is. He made it!

293
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,260
欢迎回来 少校
Welcome back, Major!

294
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,180
嗨
Hey.

295
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,140
- 兄弟们 怎么样  - 你活着回来了 罗西
- How's it going, boys? - You made it back, Rosie!

296
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,350
他回来了 罗森塔尔少校活下来了
He's back. Major Rosenthal made it.

297
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,390
厉害了
Come on!

298
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,560
嘿 兄弟们
Hey, boys.

299
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,310
- 阿吉 朋友 你好吗  - 你回来了
- Aggie, how are you, my friend? - You made it.

300
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,480
- 嘿 别被车撞了 - 要我停车吗
- Hey, don't get run over. - You want me to stop?

301
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
不...
No, no, no.

302
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,990
欢迎回来 罗西
Welcome back, Rosie!

303
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,150
好耶 罗西
All right, Rosie!

304
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,030
罗西 好耶
Rosie! Yeah!

305
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,370
然后我们从波尔塔瓦 搭乘一架C46飞往了伊朗
And then from Poltava, we flew in a C-46 to Iran,

306
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,080
然后...
and then,

307
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,510
乘同一架C46去了一个叫亚丁的地方 是英国基地
same C-46 to a place called El-Aden-- which is a Brit base--

308
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,380
然后去了雅典 罗马 那不勒斯
and then up through Athens and then Rome and Naples.

309
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,930
然后听好了
And then, get this,

310
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,770
我们转乘温斯顿丘吉尔的 私人B24“解放者”
we got transferred to Winston Churchill's personal converted B-24 Liberator--

311
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,020
没开玩笑
I kid you not--

312
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,320
飞回了圣茅根村
for the flight back to St. Mawgan's.

313
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,570
你怎么样
How are you?

314
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,160
琼怎么样
How's Jean?

315
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,780
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

316
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,000
我要当父亲了
I'm gonna be a father.

317
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
开玩笑吧
You kidding me?

318
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,380
克罗斯
Croz.

319
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,340
克罗斯 恭喜
Croz, congratulations!

320
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,090
天啊 我真替你们俩高兴
God, I'm so happy for you two.

321
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,470
是 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,600
这...是好消息 对吧
That's-- That's a good thing. Right?

323
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,850
- 是的 - 好
- Yes. - All right.

324
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,270
你确定吗
Are you sure?

325
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,770
确定 你知道 是...
Yes. You know, it's...

326
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,110
我不知道 是...
I don't know, it's--

327
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,870
我们杀这么多人
You know, all this killing we do,

328
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,210
日复一日
you know, day in, day out...

329
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,380
会对人造成影响
does something to a guy.

330
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
让人变得...
Makes him...

331
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,350
不同
different...

332
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,600
不是好的影响
not in a good way.

333
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,520
罗西 有时我一觉醒来
You know, Rosie, sometimes I wake up...

334
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,360
甚至认不出镜子里的自己
I don't even recognize myself in the mirror.

335
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,610
让我想起大学时读到的一句尼采名言
It reminds me of this quote I read at college, from Nietzsche.

336
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,370
他说
He said...

337
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,330
“与怪兽搏斗的人
"Whoever fights monsters...

338
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,380
要谨防自己变成怪兽
should take care not to become a monster himself.

339
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,260
因为当你凝视深渊时
Because if you gaze into the abyss...

340
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,270
深渊也在凝视着你”
the abyss gazes right back into you."

341
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,610
我们是来和怪兽战斗的 克罗斯
We're here to fight the monsters, Croz.

342
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
是
Yeah.

343
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,900
没错
And, yeah--

344
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,620
是 我们被迫做了一些难以启齿的事
Yeah, that's made us do some tough things...

345
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,290
但我们不得不做
but we had to.

346
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,330
别无选择
There's no other way.

347
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,710
这些人能做得出来的事
The things these people are capable of...

348
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,810
不 他们活该
No, they got it coming.

349
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
相信我
Trust me.

350
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
他们活该
They got it coming.

351
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,160
(巴伐利亚乡间 纽伦堡南方)

352
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,090
站住
Stop right there!

353
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,640
- 嘿 美国人 - 别开枪 我们是美国人
- Hey! Americans! - Whoa, we're Americans!

354
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,850
美国人 我们是美国飞行员
Americans! We're American airmen!

355
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,060
手别放下来
Keep your hands up!

356
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,930
这里有两个人说是自己人
We got two here. They say they're ours.

357
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,560
他们看起来像战俘
They look like POWs.

358
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,020
好 带他们过来
All right. Bring 'em in.

359
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,100
好 手放下吧
All right. At ease.

360
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,080
(德国 莫斯堡 第七战俘营)

361
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,340
鲍勃 找个地方给大家避避风
Bob, find a place to get 'em out of the weather.

362
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,420
是 长官
Yes, sir.

363
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,640
我猜他们不会给我们登记了
Well, I guess they're not gonna process us.

364
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,720
看起来不会
Doesn't look like it.

365
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,980
走吧
Let's go.

366
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,550
(迈克号)

367
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,210
谢谢你们送我
Thanks for the lift, guys.

368
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,050
少校 欢迎回来
Major. Welcome back.

369
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,930
克罗斯比 你怎么还在这破地方
Crosby, they still got you at this dump?

370
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,220
当然
Sure do.

371
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,560
- 少校 - 罗西
- Major. - Rosie.

372
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,680
- 你回来真好 长官 - 少校 欢迎回来
- Good to have you back, sir! - Major, welcome back!

373
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,810
莱蒙斯
Lemmons.

374
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,850
- 先生们 - 你回来真好
- Gentlemen. - Good to have you back.

375
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,600
少校 你有小帆布包吗
You got a musette bag, Major?

376
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,070
没有 我落在战俘营的套房里了
No, I left that in the suite at the stalag.

377
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,320
你看到的就是我的全部家当
What you see is what I've got.

378
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,030
我得感谢指挥官让汉克去巴黎接我
I gotta thank the CO for letting Hank pick me up in Paris.

379
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,530
我们过去几周执行了不少次接送任务
We've been running a few shuttle missions the past couple weeks.

380
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,830
这是干什么
What's this for?

381
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,580
荷兰人快饿死了
The Dutch are starving to death,

382
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:14,130
所以盟军在向须德海西边和西南边 空投大量食物
so the Allies are dropping tons of food west and southwest of the Zuider Zee.

383
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,170
本该跟德国人签订高射炮休战协议的
Supposed to be a flak truce with the Germans,

384
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,380
就是不打高射炮或防空炮
so no flak or AA guns.

385
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,550
他们到现在也没同意 但我们不管 还是飞任务
So far, they have refused, but, hell, we're flying anyway.

386
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,280
(盖尔W.克莱文少校 0399782)

387
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,820
伊根不让我们把东西寄给你父母
Egan wouldn't let us ship it to your folks.

388
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,660
他一直说“我等他回来” 还说“我的...”
Kept saying, "I expect him back,"

389
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,370
“我的哥们只是战斗中失踪”
and "My buddy's just MIA."

390
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,100
那么少校
So, Major,

391
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,390
行动部希望你不介意去飞
operations was kind of hoping you wouldn't mind flying

392
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,680
我刚才跟你说的空投任务
on this mercy mission I was just telling you about.

393
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,730
应该会有多次装货
Should be a milk run,

394
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,570
但谁知道德国人会做什么呢
but you can't be sure what the Germans are gonna do.

395
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,160
能再次驾驶飞机真好
Be nice to get behind the yoke again.

396
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,460
巴基没能和你一起逃出来
So Bucky didn't make the breakout with you, huh?

397
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,420
没有...巴基不得不...和其他人一起留下来
No. No, Bucky had to-- He had to stay behind with the men.

398
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,970
不过他挺好的 对吗
He's okay though, right?

399
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,470
是 他什么时候不好过
Yeah, when do you ever know him not to be okay?

400
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,860
我猜等战争结束 亚历克斯
I'm guessing when this is all over, Alex,

401
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,030
他们可能会从马赛或勒阿弗尔送我们回家
they'll probably send us home out of Marseille or Le Havre.

402
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,070
我觉得他们不会把我们从欢乐英格兰送走
I can't see 'em shipping us out of Merry Old England.

403
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,240
嘿...
Hey, hey!

404
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,000
梅肯 那是一架P51
Macon, that's a P-51.

405
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,710
是美国佬
It's the Yanks!

406
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,130
是一架P51
That's a P-51.

407
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,840
来了
Here they come!

408
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,810
他又绕回来了
