1
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,900
By the first few weeks of 1945,

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,440
we were closing in on the Third Reich from all sides.

3
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,730
In the west, the Allies were storming into Germany.

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,820
In the east, the Russians were approaching the Oder River.

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,080
And in the sky, the Eighth Air Force flew uncontested.

6
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,790
We were the true masters of the air.

7
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,960
Command pilot to tail, we're about to reach the target.

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,840
How are we looking back there?

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,550
Looking good, Major. All lined up.

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,630
Roger. Let's drop.

11
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,970
She's all yours, Gene.

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,140
Roger that, Major.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,480
Bomb bay doors opening. One minute to drop.

14
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,280
- Are we hit? - Starboard engines are okay.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,200
But Doug, come down here and take a look at this.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,540
A couple tanks got hit.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, sir. On my way.

18
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,880
Major, we have damage here.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,670
More oxygen bottles are ruptured. We only have six in reserve.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,760
Roger. Keep an eye on it, Doug.

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,970
Rockets incoming.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,600
Engine one's on fire. Shutting her down.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,890
Cutting fuel and oil to number one. How's she looking?

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,520
- That's it. She's out. She's out. - Good.

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,860
Approaching target. Five seconds to bomb release.

26
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,860
Bombs away.

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,840
Looked good, Luke. Looks like we m--

28
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,300
Pilot to crew, what's our damage? Report.

29
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,550
Gene, Luke, report.

30
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,310
Oil pressure is dropping on two and four. Engine three is on fire.

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,150
We're gonna lose her. We're gonna lose her.

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,520
Shit.

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,570
Lead command to deputy command, you boys are taking over.

34
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,570
Repeat, you boys are taking over.

35
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,780
Roger that. We're taking the lead.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,540
- I'm gonna take the ship, okay? - Roger.

37
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,750
I'm gonna try to get us across the Russian lines where we'll be safe.

38
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,500
Yes, sir. Your ship, Rosie.

39
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,640
Come on. Come on. Hold together a little longer.

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,850
We're losing speed. Should we bail?

41
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,390
Not yet. We're not going down in Berlin.

42
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,440
Come on, come on, come on. A little longer.

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,530
Major, left wing is shredded.

44
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,160
We're almost there.

45
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,920
That's it. She's gonna stall.

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,040
Bail. Hit the alarm and then go.

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,460
We can make it across the river from here.

48
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm gonna try to keep her level as long as I can.

49
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,300
- Go. We got smoke coming in. - Yes, sir.

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
Move.

51
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,270
- Come on, come on. Go, go. - You get it?

52
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,520
Come on.

53
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,820
Gene!

54
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,130
No, no! No, no, I'm American.

55
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,420
Amerikanski. Roosevelt. Stalin. Coca-Cola.

56
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,970
Roosevelt.

57
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,310
Goddamn it. 2300 hours. That's, what, 30 minutes? Less.

58
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,140
Go! Hustle!

59
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,440
We got half an hour. We need to be at the front gate. We're marching.

60
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,560
- Go tell the guys. Go! - Yes, sir. You got it.

61
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,580
Everyone out. Let's go. Thirty minutes.

62
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,830
Goons gave us 30 minutes to be at the front gate.

63
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,540
2300 hours, then we march. They won't say how far or for how long.

64
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,670
Thirty minutes. Jesus.

65
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,720
All right. Pack it up. Let's go. Wear the warmest clothes you got.

66
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,550
Where do you think we're going?

67
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,100
I don't know. Allies must be close.

68
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,690
Get your warmest gear.

69
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,610
Only essentials.

70
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,280
Just break it.

71
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,990
Let's go.

72
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
Bring matches.

73
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,500
Only take food that will keep.

74
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,420
The Krauts have already punched holes in the cans.

75
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,670
They won't keep.

76
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,590
Burn everything! Everything!

77
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,150
- Get your hands off it! - That's mine!

78
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,650
Get off me!

79
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,150
How you doing?

80
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,030
Would have preferred it if the Russians made it here first.

81
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,790
You're not thinking of running, are you?

82
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,210
You're not thinking of running, are you?

83
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,340
Not in this icebox.

84
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,970
Ham.

85
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,270
Hambone. I wouldn't do that if I were you.

86
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,610
Yeah?

87
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,860
Who knows when we're gonna get this kind of food again, you know?

88
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,940
Fuck off.

89
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,080
Anyone who tries to escape will be shot. Please do not try.

90
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,040
That's the Russians. They're close.

91
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,540
That's gotta be the Russians.

92
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,550
Shut your mouth, Black scum! March! Faster! Faster!

93
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,100
Okay, we're going. We're going. We're going.

94
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,220
That's how you handle terror flyers and murderers.

95
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,270
With force!

96
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,730
You okay, Solomon?

97
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,730
As okay as a Jew taking a midnight stroll in Germany can be.

98
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,590
- Bucky warned you not to-- - Don't fucking say it.

99
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,390
Okay.

100
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,850
Yeah.

101
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,810
Well, look, as soon as you have anything at all, you let me know. Okay?

102
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,310
Thanks, Bill.

103
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,610
Nothing. Still no news on any of 'em, Rosie or the crew.

104
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,820
So what's the story?

105
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,200
They went down over no-man's-land east of Berlin.

106
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,830
Jesus Christ.

107
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,950
Major, sir.

108
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,580
The hell are you doing here, son?

109
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,380
We got wheels up in five, and the equipment room's locked.

110
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,980
Let's move, people. Look alive. Let's go.

111
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,770
- You fucking-- - Hey, Clouter.

112
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,650
What are you laughing at? You had a big, fat wren last week.

113
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,410
I guess you've never flown over Germany without a parachute, huh?

114
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,750
Well, I don't know, Crosby. Have you?

115
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,710
Now, from here on out,

116
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,800
you're gonna keep that equipment hut opened and manned until wheels up

117
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,050
plus 30 minutes. Yes, Major?

118
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,840
- Yes. Major. - Yes, Major?

119
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,930
Yes, Major.

120
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,310
All right. You heard the man. Clean up. Let's go.

121
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,650
Danke. Thank you.

122
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,450
Get off the road!

123
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,910
- To the side. - Get off the road.

124
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,160
- Move! - You hear me?

125
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,170
- Off the road. Now. - Move it.

126
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,970
For blood and soil!

127
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,810
Stand up and show respect for our heroic fighters!

128
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,150
Heil Hitler.

129
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,830
Children and old men.

130
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,960
All is lost.

131
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,690
MUSKAU BRICKWORKS

132
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,410
Don't run, don't run, don't run.

133
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,200
Hey, there's enough room for everyone.

134
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Come on. Get in close. Get in close.

135
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,900
Scuttlebutt is we're heading to a train station at first light.

136
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
Scuttlebutt know where we're going?

137
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,030
No. Just to be ready at dawn.

138
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,710
This isn't good. They're gonna take us somewhere and kill us, aren't they?

139
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,790
Why move us?

140
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,750
They've had plenty of chances if they really wanted to kill us.

141
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,800
- I don't know. They're Nazis. - It'll be okay, Solly.

142
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,430
Hasn't gone exactly how we thought, has it?

143
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,190
Not exactly. You wish you'd done it differently?

144
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,150
Can't say I would have. You?

145
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,410
I wasn't planning on getting shot down.

146
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,130
You know, I really did believe that if there was only two B-17s left,

147
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,750
be you and me flying 'em.

148
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,560
Last few years would have been a lot rougher without you, John.

149
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Same.

150
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,060
We're slowing down, aren't we?

151
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,650
Any idea where we are?

152
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,120
NUREMBERG CENTRAL STATION

153
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,580
Nuremberg. Shit! It's Nuremberg. It's fucking Nuremberg. I me--

154
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,660
- Settle down, Solly. - Calm down.

155
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,500
- I'm a dead man. - It's all right, Solly.

156
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,100
We're in the heart of their fatherland now, boys.

157
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,820
Gale? Gale!

158
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,530
Gale Cleven.

159
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,200
Jesus, I'll be.

160
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,870
George. How the hell are you?

161
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,030
Long way from home.

162
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,740
Oh, my God. Hey, this is George Neithammer.

163
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,830
- John. - Only guy I've ever met

164
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,960
- knows more about baseball than you do. - Is that right?

165
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,170
- Who's your team? - Yankees. You?

166
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,340
- Cubs. - There's always next year.

167
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,970
So I'll see if we can find you boys some tents with some fires going.

168
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,260
I'm warning you, most of them don't.

169
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,930
That's okay. Happy enough to just get out of the snow.

170
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,570
The general says that he can take at airport

171
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,070
at Baranavichy,

172
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,200
for a flight to Moscow.

173
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,240
From there to England.

174
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,790
He warns you that the road is going to be very dangerous.

175
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,250
Possibly via Tehran.

176
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,800
For the smell.

177
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,980
There is a wagon ahead that had lost its wheel.

178
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,360
They have to fix it.

179
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,490
Do you mind if I-- if I stretch my legs?

180
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:29,670
"THE JUDGE OF LIFE, WILL JUDGE FOR LIFE."

181
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,400
We found many of these camps.

182
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,360
Everyone's already dead and burned before we arrived.

183
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,700
There's-- There's more of them?

184
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,490
Yes. Our comrades found even bigger camps than this.

185
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,460
They were built for killing people, many people at a time.

186
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,210
Poles, Russians. Mostly Jews.

187
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,420
The wagon, it is clear. We can resume.

188
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,110
Stay here, Major, and I will find out when the next plane for Moscow leaves.

189
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,280
Thank you, Lieutenant.

190
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,870
Where are you headed? Are you-- you headed home?

191
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Home? Family?

192
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,810
He says his family are all dead, buried in his village.

193
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,030
He said he buried them himself

194
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,200
with the other villagers the Germans killed.

195
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,080
The Germans, they ordered him to fill in the ditch.

196
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,000
Somewhere in there, his wife, his daughter, his grandchildren.

197
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,840
So, he takes the shovel.

198
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,900
To live... one must make choices.

199
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,280
Where will he go now?

200
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,050
Major, the plane to Moscow is boarding.

201
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,050
Go with God.

202
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,520
He says if God exists, He has forgotten him.

203
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,820
Not even the earth that covers our bones will remember us.

204
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,660
Major! Major, we must go. Come, hurry.

205
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,830
Let's go.

206
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
What did he say?

207
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,240
The Germans want to stay ahead of the Allies.

208
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,910
They're worried they're getting too close again, so another march.

209
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,830
We leave at 1900 hours.

210
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,950
Another night march?

211
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,710
Yeah, but I told them we won't go more than 20 kilometers a night,

212
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,290
and they agreed.

213
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,460
Spread the word.

214
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,720
Popeye's saying they're taking us across the Danube tomorrow.

215
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,310
We move tonight or we don't move at all.

216
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,310
- Tonight? - Tonight.

217
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,440
We won't be able to make a run for it after that, Gale.

218
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,070
The river's too damn big to get back to this side.

219
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,400
Listen, guys are starting to break out into groups.

220
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,620
Buck, if we keep it tight-- me, you, George, Aring--

221
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,530
you know, it's a better chance to move unseen.

222
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,920
- P-51! - Cigarettes and torches, put 'em all out!

223
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,300
Put those out!

224
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,110
Glemnitz! We told you we had to stop marching at night.

225
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,190
We're being attacked by our own goddamn planes.

226
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,990
- It's not safe. We told you it's not safe. - Bucky, calm down!

227
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,410
- It's not goddamn safe. We told you. - John, look at me. Look at me.

228
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,530
Look at me. I'm in.

229
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,160
We make a run for it tonight.

230
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Calm down before they put a bullet in your head.

231
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,090
Move it! March, march, march!

232
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,510
Bob, go tell Simoleit we've done our 20 kilometers.

233
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,720
We're stopping here and now.

234
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,800
Yes, sir.

235
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,100
Korlesky, Tiller, I want you to scout for billets.

236
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,770
Abandoned buildings-- Church, school. Whatever you can find.

237
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,410
According to Jefferson's map, there's a forest a few miles northwest.

238
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,450
If we make it that far, we should be pretty well covered.

239
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,080
We'll make it that far.

240
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,500
I say we head down that way,

241
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,090
take advantage of the confusion while we still can.

242
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,250
Over that wall.

243
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,670
All right. Who wants to go first?

244
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I'll go.

245
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,810
All right, Bill. Go.

246
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,610
All right.

247
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,980
- Get going. I'm right behind you. - All right.

248
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,240
Halt! Halt!

249
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,290
Hey, don't shoot.

250
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,710
- Go, Buck. Get out of here. - Halt!

251
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,680
Release that man. Now.

252
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,980
Let him go.

253
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,730
Goddamn it. You touch one hair on his head, and you'll have a riot.

254
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,360
Glemnitz.

255
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,690
This is one of my senior officers, and he is essential to--

256
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,200
Sergeant, order your man to release Major Egan.

257
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,030
Now.

258
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,560
The hell was that all about?

259
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,060
George, Bill and Buck, they went over that wall.

260
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
You hear that?

261
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,130
Sounds like GMCs.

262
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,130
Looks like they're retreating.

263
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,550
Pig!

264
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,180
Please.

265
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,190
Please.

266
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,940
Go!

267
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,440
Go.

268
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,950
Fucking kids.

269
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,890
We gotta go, Buck.

270
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
Buck.

271
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,070
They didn't even have any goddamn bullets.

272
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Let's go.

273
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,970
There he is. He made it!

274
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,260
Welcome back, Major!

275
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,180
Hey.

276
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,140
- How's it going, boys? - You made it back, Rosie!

277
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,350
He's back. Major Rosenthal made it.

278
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,390
Come on!

279
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,560
Hey, boys.

280
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,310
- Aggie, how are you, my friend? - You made it.

281
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,480
- Hey, don't get run over. - You want me to stop?

282
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
No, no, no.

283
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,990
Welcome back, Rosie!

284
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,150
All right, Rosie!

285
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,030
Rosie! Yeah!

286
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,370
And then from Poltava, we flew in a C-46 to Iran,

287
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,080
and then,

288
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,510
same C-46 to a place called El-Aden-- which is a Brit base--

289
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,380
and then up through Athens and then Rome and Naples.

290
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,930
And then, get this,

291
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,770
we got transferred to Winston Churchill's personal converted B-24 Liberator--

292
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,020
I kid you not--

293
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,320
for the flight back to St. Mawgan's.

294
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,570
How are you?

295
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,160
How's Jean?

296
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,780
She's pregnant.

297
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm gonna be a father.

298
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
You kidding me?

299
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Croz.

300
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,340
Croz, congratulations!

301
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,090
God, I'm so happy for you two.

302
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,470
Yeah. Yeah.

303
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,600
That's-- That's a good thing. Right?

304
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,850
- Yes. - All right.

305
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,270
Are you sure?

306
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,770
Yes. You know, it's...

307
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,110
I don't know, it's--

308
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,870
You know, all this killing we do,

309
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,210
you know, day in, day out...

310
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,380
does something to a guy.

311
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Makes him...

312
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,350
different...

313
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,600
not in a good way.

314
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,520
You know, Rosie, sometimes I wake up...

315
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,360
I don't even recognize myself in the mirror.

316
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,610
It reminds me of this quote I read at college, from Nietzsche.

317
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,370
He said...

318
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,330
"Whoever fights monsters...

319
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,380
should take care not to become a monster himself.

320
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,260
Because if you gaze into the abyss...

321
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,270
the abyss gazes right back into you."

322
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,610
We're here to fight the monsters, Croz.

323
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Yeah.

324
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,900
And, yeah--

325
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,620
Yeah, that's made us do some tough things...

326
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,290
but we had to.

327
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,330
There's no other way.

328
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,710
The things these people are capable of...

329
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,810
No, they got it coming.

330
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
Trust me.

331
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
They got it coming.

332
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,090
Stop right there!

333
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,640
- Hey! Americans! - Whoa, we're Americans!

334
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,850
Americans! We're American airmen!

335
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,060
Keep your hands up!

336
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,930
We got two here. They say they're ours.

337
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,560
They look like POWs.

338
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,020
All right. Bring 'em in.

339
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,100
All right. At ease.

340
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,340
Bob, find a place to get 'em out of the weather.

341
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,420
Yes, sir.

342
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,640
Well, I guess they're not gonna process us.

343
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,720
Doesn't look like it.

344
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,980
Let's go.

345
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,210
Thanks for the lift, guys.

346
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,050
Major. Welcome back.

347
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,930
Crosby, they still got you at this dump?

348
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,220
Sure do.

349
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,560
- Major. - Rosie.

350
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,680
- Good to have you back, sir! - Major, welcome back!

351
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,810
Lemmons.

352
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,850
- Gentlemen. - Good to have you back.

353
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,600
You got a musette bag, Major?

354
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,070
No, I left that in the suite at the stalag.

355
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,320
What you see is what I've got.

356
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,030
I gotta thank the CO for letting Hank pick me up in Paris.

357
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,530
We've been running a few shuttle missions the past couple weeks.

358
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,830
What's this for?

359
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,580
The Dutch are starving to death,

360
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:14,130
so the Allies are dropping tons of food west and southwest of the Zuider Zee.

361
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,170
Supposed to be a flak truce with the Germans,

362
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,380
so no flak or AA guns.

363
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,550
So far, they have refused, but, hell, we're flying anyway.

364
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,820
Egan wouldn't let us ship it to your folks.

365
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,660
Kept saying, "I expect him back,"

366
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,370
and "My buddy's just MIA."

367
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,100
So, Major,

368
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,390
operations was kind of hoping you wouldn't mind flying

369
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,680
on this mercy mission I was just telling you about.

370
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,730
Should be a milk run,

371
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,570
but you can't be sure what the Germans are gonna do.

372
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,160
Be nice to get behind the yoke again.

373
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,460
So Bucky didn't make the breakout with you, huh?

374
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,420
No. No, Bucky had to-- He had to stay behind with the men.

375
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,970
He's okay though, right?

376
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,470
Yeah, when do you ever know him not to be okay?

377
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,860
I'm guessing when this is all over, Alex,

378
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,030
they'll probably send us home out of Marseille or Le Havre.

379
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,070
I can't see 'em shipping us out of Merry Old England.

380
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,240
Hey, hey!

381
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,000
Macon, that's a P-51.

382
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,710
It's the Yanks!

383
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,130
That's a P-51.

384
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,840
Here they come!

385
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,810
He's coming back.

386
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,570
He's coming back!

387
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,490
Down! Get down!

388
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,330
Yeah! Come on!

389
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,380
All right, we're going home!

390
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,460
Come on!

391
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,090
Everybody down!

392
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,310
Move! Get out of the way!

393
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,250
Fellas! Take out the tower!

394
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,130
Buckle, Kraut!

395
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,600
Hey, guys, you got a flag? Who's got the flag?

396
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,680
No flag, sir.

397
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,270
- You got a flag in here? - No flag, sir!

398
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,780
- Flag! No flags at all, huh? - No flag.

399
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,940
- No flag at all? - Get our flag!

400
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,610
- Hey, hey, you got a flag? - I've got it! Here.

401
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,700
Major!

402
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,240
Here it is.

403
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,070
Help me up!

404
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,410
- Don't shoot. - Give me one reason.

405
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,490
Stay reasonable.

406
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,410
We're going home!

407
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,330
Freedom!

408
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,870
How does it feel?

409
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,920
- Yeah! - Yeah! Take that thing down!

410
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,090
Go, Bucky!

411
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,600
Bucky! Come on. Yeah!

412
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,900
Yeah! Tear it up!

413
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,990
Yeah! Do it! Tear it up!

414
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,540
All right, Bucky!

415
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,660
USA!

416
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:52,070
Colonel, the camp and the village are yours.

417
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,200
I will hand over my men, disarmed, in 30 minutes.

418
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,660
Dismissed.

419
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,670
Colonel Clark, let's get 'em back.

420
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,380
Yes!

421
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,930
Rosie.

422
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,100
Major.

423
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,570
Some gum, D-bars,

424
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,070
and, hey, look at this.

425
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,610
First fresh oranges we've seen in months. Probably years for the Dutch.

426
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,700
Nice.

427
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,240
- Oh, Major. - Major.

428
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,330
Croz.

429
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,250
Let's go feed some people.

430
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,620
Yes, sir. Sounds good.

431
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,610
I hope you don't mind, but I usually take the left seat.

432
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,070
Well, always actually.

433
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,570
I'll get the general on the phone.

434
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,820
No, I'm just kidding you.

435
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,080
It's an honor.

436
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,500
Ready preflight checks?

437
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,670
Never readier.

438
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:18,920
Form 1A?

439
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,010
Checked.

440
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,470
Controls and the seats?

441
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,130
Check.

442
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,220
Ken?

443
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,220
The hell you doing here?

444
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,600
A hundred bucks says you can't think of a better flight engineer.

445
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,770
Plus, well,

446
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,980
I thought he'd get a kick out of actually flying in one of these things.

447
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,150
- You've never flown in a plane before? - No, sir.

448
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,450
- Wha-- Ever? - Never.

449
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:47,820
I took a boat over here in '43 and then, well, I never had a reason to fly.

450
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,830
Start one.

451
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,650
How's the view, Kenny?

452
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,030
Beautiful.

453
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,150
It's something, ain't it?

454
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,930
Navigator to pilot, coming around to 090, over.

455
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,050
Pilot to navigator, roger.

456
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,480
Here we go.

457
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,530
Get ready, everybody.

458
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,070
Approaching Valkenburg.

459
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,240
Feel free to say a little prayer that they don't open fire on us,

460
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,290
if you're so inclined.

461
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,930
Looks like we're good, boys.

462
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,230
Germans decided to honor the truce.

463
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,690
Smart Krauts.

464
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,070
Hey, look at this.

465
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,210
You can see 'em.

466
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,710
Drop on your best guess, Doug.

467
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,840
Roger that, Major.

468
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,930
Bomb bay doors opening.

469
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,520
Crates away.

470
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,950
There you go. We did it.

471
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,170
Hey, look, look.

472
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,260
"Thanks, Yanks."

473
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,300
Look at that.

474
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,240
Clearup Tower, this is Chowhound One requesting landing instructions. Over.

475
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,490
Chowhound One, you are clear for overhead approach.

476
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,490
Runway 281 at 1,200 indicated.

477
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,410
Winds are 300 at 12.

478
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,920
Altimeter, 29.96. Over.

479
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,460
Clearup Tower, please repeat. Over.

480
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,210
You heard me the first goddamn time, Gale.

481
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,510
Well, I'll be damned.

482
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,020
Look who it is.

483
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,900
Stone in my shoe.

484
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,320
I'm back.

485
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,450
How's it feel being back up there?

486
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,080
Felt good.

487
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,370
Look who's back.

488
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,370
- Harry. - John Egan.

489
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,790
- How are ya? - Very good, sir.

490
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,210
- Pleasure to see you. - You too.

491
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,880
- Not still throwing up, are ya? - No.

492
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,250
- Good to have you back. - Kenny, how are ya?

493
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,300
Rosie, what a pleasure. Nice to see you. How are ya?

494
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,720
We made a few of those supply drops in the last days of the war.

495
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,680
And then, one day...

496
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:25,640
Yesterday morning at 2:41 a.m.

497
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:29,570
at General Eisenhower's headquarters...

498
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,690
...It was over.

499
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,360
...General Jodl,

500
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,320
the representative of the German High Command,

501
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,160
and of Grand Admiral D?nitz,

502
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,120
the designated head of the German State,

503
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,040
signed the act of unconditional surrender

504
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:54,720
of all German land, sea and air forces in Europe

505
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,340
to the Allied Expeditionary Force

506
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,430
and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.

507
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:10,060
Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight,

508
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,820
Tuesday, the 8th of May.

509
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:17,650
But in the interest of saving lives, the cease-fire began yesterday

510
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:24,450
to be sounded all along the front and our dear Channel Islands.

511
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,120
- Right. Hey, come here! Get her-- - One more, please!

512
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,040
Drink up, fellas. We're heading home.

513
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,290
Light it up!

514
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,130
Yeah! We're going home, baby!

515
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,800
We did it, fellas!

516
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,310
Yeah!

517
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,660
Close it up, boys.

518
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,660
Let's go.

519
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,790
At first, it felt unreal,

520
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,750
impossible, unimaginable.

521
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:55,250
And then, inevitable.

522
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,710
We were going home.

523
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,170
Your ride awaits, Major.

524
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,260
All of us.

525
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,340
I had a wife to see.

526
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,430
Thanks, buddy.

527
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,510
A son.

528
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,270
A life to start.

529
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,270
I better see you at Minton's when I get back.

530
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:15,360
I'll be there.

531
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,690
You can bring the little guy.

532
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,820
You want me to bring my infant son to a jazz club?

533
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,820
Hey, it's never too early.

534
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,160
You're gonna be a hell of a father, Croz.

535
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,960
You think?

536
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I know.

537
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,180
They won!

538
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,470
Hey.

539
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,520
This is it.

540
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,310
This is it.

541
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,600
You ready to go home?

542
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,310
You ready to see Marge?

543
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,070
I bet.

544
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,070
Form 1A?

545
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,280
Checked.

546
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,660
Controls and seats?

547
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,950
- Check. - Fuel transfer valves and switch?

548
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:33,620
Off.

549
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,960
Leaving a lot of good men behind.

550
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,170
A lot of brave men.

551
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,760
Yeah.

552
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,670
Intercoolers cold.

553
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,990
Gear up.

554
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,970
On occasion, the world must confront itself,

555
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,180
answer what we are with who we are.

556
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,520
I was going home.

557
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,430
I just wished more of us were.

558
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:45,020
We'll miss you. Bye-bye!

559
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,240
Bye for now! Bye-bye!

560
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,600
- All right. - All right. This is it.

561
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,690
Seventy.

562
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,190
Eighty.

563
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,070
Ninety.

564
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:36,950
Here we come.

565
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,040
Landing gear up.

566
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,090
Climb power.
