1
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:18,830
伦敦
1896年8月3日

2
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,990
霍雷肖・科森斯医生

3
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,330
三年后

4
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,100
早上好 特鲁夫人
Good morning, Mrs. True.

5
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,280
特鲁夫人
Mrs. True.

6
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,330
阿代尔小姐
Miss Adair.

7
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,660
-你太美了  -谁说不是呢
- You look very fine. - I think so, too.

8
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,620
圣罗毛尔达孤儿院

9
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,310
我是问 你在这转来转去干什么
What are you walking around here for? That's what I'm saying.

10
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,590
-我只是...  - 不是 等会儿
-Oh, I just... -No, wait!

11
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,510
您快管管这个人吧
Will you do something about this man, please?

12
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,060
快来看看"星辰报"
Read it in "The Star"!

13
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,450
玛拉黛手下的第五名受害者
Maladie kills fifth victim!

14
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,890
玛拉黛杀人

15
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,120
这场杀人狂欢让开膛手杰克都相形见绌
Murder spree soon to eclipse The Ripper!

16
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,770
你应该还感应不到结果吧
I don't suppose you know how this all works out.

17
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,650
这又不是随叫随到的
The ripplings don't come when they're called.

18
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,690
那我们还是尽量礼貌点
Well, let's just try to keep it civil.

19
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,140
别像对待旅店老板那样
Not like with the innkeeper.

20
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,670
-那是因为他有猎枪  -这借口我听过了
- He had a shotgun. - I've heard that excuse before.

21
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,380
谁叫他们都有猎枪
When they have shotguns.

22
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,130
-这女孩 什么情况  -桃金娘・哈普利琪
- What's the, uh, girl? - Myrtle Haplisch.

23
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,600
跟她的声音有关
Something to do with her voice.

24
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,330
日安 哈普利琪先生
Good day, Mr. Haplisch.

25
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,690
你们好
Yes.

26
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,310
-你是...  -我是阿玛莉亚・特鲁
-Are you, uh... -I'm Amalia True.

27
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,930
这位是我的同事 派南斯・阿代尔
This is my colleague, Penance Adair.

28
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,470
牧师告知你我们会前来拜访吗
The reverend told you we were coming?

29
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,340
是的 桃金娘的事
Oh, yeah. About Myrtle.

30
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,530
请... 进
Um, come... in.

31
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,200
太太
Missus!

32
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,340
请 到会客室来吧
Please, come through to the, um, parlor.

33
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,700
他们说 桃金娘可能... 被附魔了
They're saying Myrtle might be... Touched?

34
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,990
过去几年 我们听说过那些姑娘的事
We, we heard about those girls the last few years.

35
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,900
她们... 不太对劲
They're... not right.

36
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,880
对或是错 被附魔并不属于人格缺陷
Neither right nor wrong, being Touched is not a defect of character.

37
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,440
但那个杀人犯...
But isn't that killer...

38
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,290
玛拉黛 她不就是其中一员吗
Mal-Maladie. Isn't she one of them?

39
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,520
玛拉黛嗜杀成性 但我不知道她是否被附魔
Maladie's homicidal. I don't know if she's Touched.

40
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,190
-桃金娘也不能确定  -她肯定是附魔之人
- We don't know if Myrtle is. - Oh, she's Touched, all right.

41
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,780
被红靴子泰迪附魔的
Touched by Red Boot Teddy!

42
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,760
我们一致认为 存在一种邪恶的力量
We're, um, of a mind, there's a Satanic element.

43
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,500
她是路西法的容器
She's Lucifer's vessel, is what.

44
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,310
借她之口说话
He speaks through her.

45
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,650
上楼去
Up!

46
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,430
其实 牧师也提到她口齿不清
Yes, uh, the reverend mentioned an affliction of the tongue.

47
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,340
那是因为撒旦正盘踞在她身上
'Cause old Satan is squattin' on it.

48
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,030
吐出他的污言秽语
Spewing out his foulness,

49
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,250
把我们桃金娘的嘴搞得跟夜壶一样恶臭
making a chamber pot of our Myrtle's mouth.

50
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,270
那有点过于形象了
Well, that's a bit descriptive.

51
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,930
新买的水壶
new kettle.

52
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,420
-水开的话就...  -索菲
-It tells you when it's, um... -Sophie!

53
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,110
桃金娘现在在家吗
Is Myrtle here at home, then?

54
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,630
-为什么要用链子拴着她  -以防传染
- Why is she chained? - Infection.

55
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,480
家里还有其他人呢
W-w-we got the others.

56
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,400
出去 我说出去
Out. Get out. Get out, I say.

57
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,510
桃金娘是唯一一个新劳工法出台后能挣到钱的人
Myrtle was the only one could earn a wage with the new labor laws.

58
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,660
现在成这样了
Now this.

59
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,060
桃金娘 我是派南斯 这位是特鲁夫人
Myrtle, I'm Penance and that's Mrs. True.

60
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,450
我能坐下吗
May I sit?

61
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,760
我们是来帮你解决你的烦恼的
we've come to help with what's been troublin' ya.

62
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,810
有很多女孩跟你一样
There's plenty of girls who've been shown

63
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,940
出现了类似的异象 一种"转变"
a strangeness of some kind. A "turn."

64
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,990
但特鲁夫人和我帮助了她们 结果都很好
But Mrs. True and I, we've worked with them, and they come up fine.

65
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,980
想要我们帮助你吗
Would you like that?

66
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,630
说话啊 桃金娘
Speak, Myrtle.

67
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,330
应该是"说话啊 撒旦"
You mean, "Speak, Satan"?

68
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,330
你看吧
See?

69
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,870
桃金娘 你能听懂我说话吧
Myrtle, you can understand me, yes?

70
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,780
中文
Chinese?!

71
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,030
大部分吧 其中一些是俄语
Most of it. Some of it may have been Russian.

72
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,500
其他的应该是... 土耳其语
And I want to say... Turkish?

73
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,010
我的猜测是 她脑子里塞满了现有已知的语言
I'd guess every known language is crowding her mind.

74
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,630
桃金娘这样的女孩怎么会懂中文
How would a girl like Myrtle learn Chinese?

75
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,080
她甚至都没见过中国人
She's never even seen a Chinaman.

76
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,340
至少我们能排除
Well, at least we can rule out

77
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,770
邪恶力量这个选项了
any sort of Satanic influence.

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,040
-那些杂技演员  -什么
- Those acrobats. - What?

79
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,040
不是 他们只是滚来滚去罢了
No! They just tumbled about.

80
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,740
他们来巴尼公园表演空翻和平衡技巧
They come to Barney Park doing flips and balancing.

81
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,680
他们浑身散发着邪气
They had an unnatural air.

82
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,250
我之前就说过 还有一只猴子
I said it then. And there was a monkey!

83
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,070
-它直勾勾地盯着我  -是...
- He looked right at me. - Yes. Well...

84
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,150
-我就直说了...  -感谢你们给我们机会
- Allow me to be frank... - After being grateful

85
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,490
为桃金娘提供帮助...
for the chance to give Myrtle the kind of care...

86
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,640
别让他们上来
Keep them down here.

87
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,000
果然
Right.

88
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
先生们
Gentlemen.

89
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,590
你们能礼貌点吗
Might we be civil?

90
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,120
贱人
You bitch!

91
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,980
派南斯
Penance!

92
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,430
发光体
Shiner!

93
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,130
找辆马车来
Get the carriage!

94
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,350
爸爸 那位女士跟他们摔跤来着
Da! The lady did a wrestle!

95
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,060
快 我们走
Come on. Let's go!

96
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,060
就是现在 桃金娘 快跑
Now! Myrtle, run!

97
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,240
特鲁
True!

98
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,390
你看见那人的脸了吗
Did you see that face?

99
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,000
我觉得还是带枪的人好对付
I think I preferred when people just had shotguns.

100
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,940
不不不 我错了
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

101
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,800
我们跑不过他们 我们得变形
We can't outrun them. We're going to have to change it out.

102
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,450
你是说... 可这只是个原型机啊
you mean... It's only a prototype.

103
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,940
我们也觉得不可思议
This is weird for us, too.

104
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,410
低头
Heads down!

105
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,830
快让开
Out of the way!

106
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,550
让一让
One side!

107
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,340
我觉得你最好跟我们呆一块儿
I, I think it's best if you come stay with us for a bit.

108
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,720
如果你愿意的话
If that suits ya.

109
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,290
我们能 我们能一起对付他们
We can, we can deal with those fellas.

110
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,830
搞清楚他们的目的 或者他们是谁
We can find out what they want, or what they

111
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,390
我们要怎么对付他们
are. How are we gonna deal with those fellas?

112
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,820
特鲁
True?

113
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,120
去歌剧院
We're going to the opera.

114
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,850
看见没 我们已经有计划了
See? We already got a plan.

115
00:13:53,770 --> 00:14:01,020
永不者

第一季 第 1 集

116
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,830
就一个女人
It's just a woman.

117
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,960
杀了五个男人 我敢说她的能力远不止如此
Five men murdered. I'd say she's more than that.

118
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,860
确实 谋杀
Yes, murder.

119
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,480
真够让人头疼的
Very distressing.

120
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,220
"玛拉黛"就是个疯子
This "Maladie" is a lunatic.

121
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,170
佩妮插图报 上帝的天使纷纷陨落

122
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,580
苏格兰场已经安排特勤人员去抓她了
Scotland Yard has their Special Detail to catch her.

123
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,790
无论她是否被附魔 都不值得我们管
What matter if she's Touched? This is beneath us.

124
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,760
精神分析师们 小心

125
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,210
她杀的不是妓女 阁下
She is not killing whores, your grace.

126
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,320
是受人尊敬的绅士
These are respectable men.

127
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,550
别仰望天堂 会让你盲目
上帝

128
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,730
精神分析学家罢了
Psychoanalysts.

129
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,910
首相打算
Well, the Prime Minister intends to take

130
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,500
对附魔之人公开表态
a public position on the Touched.

131
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,770
我们得决定立场问题
We need to decide what it is.

132
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,350
不过是几个女人耍耍把戏罢了...
A few women pulling parlor tricks...

133
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,370
不只是女人
It's not just women.

134
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,920
也不只是几个
And it's not a few.

135
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,010
至少得有上百人
There are hundreds, at least,

136
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,760
染上这种罕见又让人费解的怪病
of unique, inexplicable afflictions.

137
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,320
拉维妮娅・毕德罗为他们开展慈善事业
Lavinia Bidlow has made a cause of them.

138
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,650
这也是为何首相需要...
Which is why the PM needs to take a...

139
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,300
女士们受到了攻击
Women are being attacked,

140
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,260
被指控施加巫术或某种远域巫毒 并...
accused of witchcraft, or some island voodoo, and...

141
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,220
无稽之谈
Fairy stories.

142
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,630
这些不过是电流引起的
These are biological anomalies,

143
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,920
生理异常现象
caused by electricity.

144
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,120
马森勋爵 你怎么看
Uh, Lord Massen?

145
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,660
有个女孩上个月开始在我的发电机厂上班
A girl started in my engine works last month

146
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,430
负责擦拭压光机
wiping down the plating press.

147
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,610
她滑了一跤 手臂被压力机夹住了
She slipped. Got her arm caught in the press.

148
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,590
然后她没事人一样把手臂拽出来
And then she pulled it back out.

149
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,580
三吨重的压力啊
Three tons of pressure,

150
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,050
还弄断了液压轴承 却毫发无伤
and she snapped the hydraulic without so much as a bruise.

151
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,370
-人们欢呼  -不如招她入伍吧
- People cheered. - Well, I say enlist her.

152
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
派她去攻打该死的布尔人
Point her at the bloody Boers.

153
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
[布尔人 南非白人]

154
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,110
坏了台机器而已 我还是那句话 先生们
A machine breaks. Again, gentlemen,

155
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,930
这又不是军队部署
this isn't a troop deployment,

156
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,530
也不是市场崩盘
or a, a market crash.

157
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,580
首相是不会对"附魔之人"表态的
The Prime Minister will not be taking a position on the Touched.

158
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,860
也不会允许任何与此相关的官方讨论
Nor will he allow any official debate on the subject.

159
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,050
我们得先了解这次攻击的性质和规模
Not until we understand the nature and breadth of the attack.

160
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,090
-攻击  -你是说"附魔之人"
- Attack? - You're declaring the Touched

161
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,650
是对大英帝国的直接威胁吗
a direct threat against the empire.

162
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,120
我们誓死保卫的帝国
Which we here are sworn to protect.

163
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,750
万众一心 一致抗敌
Contra hostes omnes.

164
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,550
这场攻击预计将在何时...
And this attack is expected to come...

165
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,420
三年前就开始了
It came three years ago.

166
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,870
1896年8月3日
Third of August, 1896.

167
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,160
一个灰蒙蒙的周一
A Monday. Rather gray.

168
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,310
在那之前从未有人被"附魔"
Not one case of someone being Touched before then.

169
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,750
且都出现在伦敦
Not one outside London.

170
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,480
海外报道的那些附魔之人当时全在伦敦
Those reported overseas were all here at the time.

171
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,340
且位高权重的男性均未感染
And not one man of stature afflicted.

172
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,370
这才是厉害之处
That's the genius of it.

173
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,790
他们通过女性来攻击我们
They came at us through our women.

174
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,100
"他们"
"They"?

175
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,870
我还不确定几桩奇闻异事
I'm still not sure I can equate a few bizarre anecdotes

176
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,680
是否能称得上是大军攻击
with the Mongol horde.

177
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,200
只有庸君才需要让刀被刺进肚子
Only a blind man measures the length of a blade

178
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
去衡量刀长
by how much is in his belly.

179
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,560
-你说得太过了 马森  -这一切是设计好的
- Your overstep the mark, Massen. - This was designed

180
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,360
所以我们仅能管中窥豹
so that we would see the parts,

181
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,090
只见一斑
and not the whole.

182
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,790
像拉维妮娅・毕德罗那种慈善家
Philanthropists like Lavinia Bidlow

183
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,960
看到的是附魔之人的痛苦
see the suffering of the afflicted.

184
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,380
大众看到的则是一名冷血女杀手
The common throng see a macabre murderess.

185
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,550
而你看到的是台坏了的机器
And you see a broken machine.

186
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,200
这正是我所看到的
That is exactly what I see.

187
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,720
一台最伟大的机器
The greatest machine.

188
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,230
我们帝国之首府停滞不前
The heart of our empire brought to a shuddering halt

189
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,700
皆因那些人的反复无常和野心
by the caprice and ambitions of those

190
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,210
而曾经 野心于他们一无是处
for whom ambition was never meant.

191
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,790
这是力量至上的时代
This is the Age of Power.

192
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,570
-新的力量  -X光
- New power. - The X-ray.

193
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,040
-无线电  -电力
- The wireless. - Electricity.

194
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,580
我们是对革新习以为常的初代人
We are the first generation accustomed to the impossible.

195
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,070
女人们今天对此闻风丧胆
What women are appalled by today,

196
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,630
明天就会接受
they will accept tomorrow,

197
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,410
后天便也想要
and demand the day after that.

198
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,260
还有移民 和离经叛道之人
And the immigrant. And the deviant.

199
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,200
这种被操纵的力量 却不在我们掌控之中
That is the power being wielded, and not by us.

200
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,540
刀已落下 先生们
The blade is in, gentlemen.

201
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,880
我们要查出手握刀柄之人
We need to know whose hand is on the hilt.

202
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:08,520
.                      环线
前往火车站             .

203
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,370
别让任何人进来
Nobody gets through.

204
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,220
再加把劲儿 琼斯
Put your back into it, Jones,

205
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,900
-你个懒鬼...  -遵命 长官
- you lazy... - Yes, sir.

206
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,500
再跟不上进度 你们就全给我滚蛋
We get any further behind, I'll pluck the lot of ya!

207
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,580
当着长官的面 放尊重点
Not in front of the officer. Show some respect.

208
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,060
蒙迪探长
Detective Mundi.

209
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,220
你是特勤组的 对吧
You're the Special Detail, yeah?

210
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,170
-你得看看这个  -是吗
- You're gonna wanna see this. - Am I?

211
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,500
小心头
Mind your head.

212
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,970
一名矿工被她的尸体绊倒了
Was a digger stumbled on her.

213
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,850
差点亲上了
Near had a kiss, they did.

214
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,040
这里 看见这些刺伤了吗
Here. You see the stab wounds?

215
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,910
大伙儿举着火把进来
These mates brung the torches in.

216
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,960
在墙上发现了这个
They spotted this on the wall.

217
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,700
看看我的大作
我是死亡天师

218
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,350
才知道是她干的
That's how they knew it was one of hers.

219
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,680
是条讯息
It's a message.

220
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700


221
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,400
不是玛拉黛干的
Not from Maladie.

222
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,770
你怎么能确定
But how can you be sure?

223
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,170
她起码不会拼错
She can spell.

224
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,810
那个矿工认出受害者了吗
Did he recognize the victim? The digger?

225
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,630
没有
No.

226
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,240
也没法辨认 老鼠都把她的脸啃烂了
Well, not much to recognize, the rats having had a go.

227
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,290
经常有流浪汉和醉汉在这里躲着
You get vagrants and drunks taking shelter down here all the time.

228
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
这女人两者都不是
This woman was neither.

229
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,940
这是通往哪儿的
Where does this lead?

230
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,730
这本来是南线的维修隧道
It was meant to be the maintenance tunnel

231
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,030
但被废弃了
for the southern line, but it got scrapped.

232
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,010
扩建地铁任务繁重
There's too much to do, expanding the underground.

233
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,580
这座城早晚得塌了
The city'll fall in on itself.

234
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,390
你这工作我可干不来
I don't envy you this job.

235
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,420
-是啊  -谁动了尸体
- Yeah. - Who moved the body?

236
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,430
一定是... 等等 什么
Must have been... Wait. What?

237
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,320
-没人 一直都在这  -她不是在这儿被杀的
- No, it was there. - She wasn't killed there.

238
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,180
她的血比墙上的猪血干得早多了
And her blood's been dry a lot longer than this pig's.

239
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,650
不 不是...
No. It's not... Oi.

240
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,660
你怎么乱加揣测啊
You're tossing about a lot of assumptions.

241
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,300
显然 这是我的职责
Clearly I meant to.

242
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,480
好了 全面停工 排成一排
Right. Shut this lot down. Line 'em up.

243
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,970
-不...  -我们得检查这里的每个人
- No... - We check every man in here

244
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,600
看看谁手上或者衣服上有血迹
for blood on his hands or his clothes.

245
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,500
你 你不能叫我们停工 我们有进度要赶
You, you can't stop the dig. We got a schedule to keep.

246
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,990
谋杀还比不上赶进度呢 是吧
And what's a murder to that, eh?

247
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,170
怎么 你以为自己是第一个试图嫁祸给玛拉黛的人吗
What? You think you're the first to try and pin something on Maladie?

248
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,750
人们一遇上附魔之人都以为是她
People think every Touched they meet might be her.

249
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,990
他们之中某些人 确实够奇怪的
And some of them Touched, they're weird enough. They are.

250
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,120
让人起鸡皮疙瘩 而你
Make your skin crawl. But here's you,

251
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,120
放任真凶逍遥法外
letting a killer get off by making it harder to catch another one.

252
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,040
-就为了赶工作进度  -你这人我知道 弗兰克・蒙迪
- For a schedule. - I know about you, Frank Mundi.

253
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,590
东城猿人 总爱以拳头制人
East End Ape. Always fists first.

254
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,630
死人都能被你揪上来逼供认罪
He could beat a confession out of a headstone.

255
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,360
你尽管装成正义的化身
You can play the righteous man,

256
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,240
但就算是你 也是替人办事
but even you answer to someone.

257
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,450
没错 就替她
Yes, I do. She's right there.

258
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,540
现在 那个女人惨死
Now, that woman faced an horrible end.

259
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,640
我不认为你是凶手
And I don't think you killed her,

260
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,430
但也不会让你埋葬她
but I'm not letting you bury her.

261
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,660
你不是特勤组的吗
What about the Special Detail?

262
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,550
凶手如果不是玛拉黛 那这案子就不归你管
If it's not Maladie done this, then it's not your case.

263
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,430
不 就是玛拉黛干的
Oh, no. Maladie done this, didn't she?

264
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,500
因为她在墙上留了言
Because she left a message.

265
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,250
所以你给我从实招来 你动手脚之前墙上写的什么
So you're gonna tell me what was here before you dressed it up,

266
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,470
再说谎试试 我可不光是在破案
'cause one more lie, and I'm not on a case,

267
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,990
我他妈可是"死亡天师"
I'm the fucking "Angle" of Death.

268
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,480
别关门
Leave the doors!

269
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,070
特鲁夫人带了个新人回来
Mrs. True's back with a new one.

270
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,150
她们开着派南斯的... 原型机
They's in Penance's... Uh, the prolatype.

271
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,740
什么 那辆自动马车吗
What, the auto-carriage?

272
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,500
太神奇了 普丽姆罗丝 快来看看
It's mad. Primrose, you got to see.

273
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,660
妈妈说了机动车很常见
Mother says motorcars are common.

274
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,820
普通吗 一共就八辆啊
Common? There's only eight of them that ever were.

275
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,410
我不指望你会明白
I wouldn't expect you to understand,

276
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,260
但妈妈说它们是个祸害
but Mother says they're a blight.

277
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,890
是吗 她最近说的吗
Yeah? She say that lately?

278
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,280
可能是她某次来访 我们都不在吧
On a visit, maybe, that we all missed.

279
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,410
-说得好像你知道怎么当母亲一样  -普丽姆罗丝
- As though you know anything about being a mother. - Primrose!

280
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,230
-她不是这个意思  -她是觉得长大了就不会被打屁股吗
- She didn't mean that. - Does she think she's too big for a spanking?

281
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,960
我们来啦
Coming through!

282
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,240
好了好了 来吧
All right. All right, come on.

283
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,990
别围着了 只是辆马车而已
Don't suffocate them. It's only a carriage.

284
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,790
居然不是
No?

285
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,760
这太他妈帅了
That's fuckin' amazing.

286
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,080
桃金娘 这是霍雷肖・科森斯医生 他经常骂骂咧咧的
Myrtle, this is Dr. Horatio Cousens. He swears a lot.

287
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,850
我才没有
No, I don't.

288
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,770
-旅途如何  -挺精彩的
- How was your journey? - Eventful.

289
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,650
露西 我要写封信给毕德罗夫人
Lucy, I need to send a letter to Mrs. Bidlow.

290
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,960
告诉她我们被袭击的事
Let her know about the attack.

291
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,840
袭击 发生了什么
Attack? What attack?

292
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,750
露西 把笔和纸准备好
Lucy. Pen. Paper.

293
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,220
我在你房间准备一下
I'll set up in your rooms.

294
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,090
-先谈公事  -不行
- Shop talk first. - Not first.

295
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,560
只是擦伤而已
This is just a scratch.

296
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,400
-普丽姆罗丝  -我坐不进去
- Primrose? - I can't ride it in,

297
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,090
-我看不出…  -不是…
-so I don't see what... -No, it's just...

298
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,260
我记得你说没有同龄人说说话
I recalled you saying you didn't have anyone your own age to talk to.

299
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,020
我是查塔韦小姐
I'm Miss Chattoway.

300
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,210
叫我普丽姆罗丝就好
But you may call me Primrose.

301
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,830
希望我们能成为朋友
I hope we'll be friends.

302
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,180
所以你的"转变"是什么 我是变大了
So what's your "turn"? I'm large.

303
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,710
桃金娘语言上异于常人
Myrtle has a language situation,

304
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,640
我想她可以先喝杯茶
and I imagine she could use a cup of tea.

305
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,970
-好的 你想…  -她懂英语
- Oh. Um, do you want... - She does speak English.

306
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,770
只是说不出来而已
But not with her mouth.

307
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,370
好的 和我来吧
All right. Come with me.

308
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,550
我们应该在这车里结婚
We should be married in this.

309
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,820
这有什么新鲜的
How is this new?

310
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,290
自打知道我们被附魔以后 人们就开始攻击我们
People been attacking us since they known we was Touched.

311
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,750
-或者说一直都是  -这次不一样
- Or since always. - This is different.

312
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,520
这一整天
This whole day.

313
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,540
我们越是蓬勃发展 他们就越会抨击我们
We knew people would come down on us the more we were thriving.

314
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,370
-他们为什么会想要…  -桃金娘吗
- Why would they want this... - Myrtle?

315
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,740
我猜她不是第一个
I don't think she's the first.

316
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,870
我觉得他们这样做已经有一段时间了
I think they've been doing this for some time.

317
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,870
有些女孩我们一到 她们就恰巧"跑掉了"
All those girls we went after who'd "just run away"?

318
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,150
老天
Lord.

319
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,940
我们要加固防备
We need to bolster our security.

320
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,150
所有出口 门窗都要守好或锁死
All entrances, windows bolted or blocked.

321
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,310
我可以给他们准备些小惊喜
I could rig up a few surprises, as well.

322
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,430
不会造成致命伤害 但能劝退他们
Nothing lethal, but very discouraging.

323
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,160
每个人进出都要登记时间和目的地
Everyone signs in and out. Time and destination.

324
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,860
不能独自外出 天黑也不许出门
No one goes out alone or after dark.

325
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,680
-不允许访客进入  -就那一次
- Not even visitors. - One time.

326
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,540
我一直在教女孩们格斗技巧
I've been showing the girls a bit of scrapping.

327
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,060
-你倾囊相授  -但别用她们的"转变"
- You'll show them all. - But not using their "turns."

328
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,000
手头有的这些就足够了
Well, there's plenty you can do with what's at hand.

329
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,970
自信最重要 就像我妈妈之前说的
It's about confidence. As my mum used to say,

330
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,710
如果你能直视一个男人的眼睛
if you can look a man in the eye,

331
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,230
你就能捅他眼珠子
you can stab him in it.

332
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,120
聪明的女人
Smart woman.

333
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,070
但别真这么做
But also, don't do that.

334
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,570
告诉乞丐王 我想见他
The Beggar King. Tell him I need to see him.

335
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,460
我们付钱让他保护我们
We pay him for protection,

336
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,980
他告诉我们疑似的附魔之人
and he's been feeding us potential candidates.

337
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,170
我们得知道他是不是把消息外泄了
I need to know if he's been feeding anyone else.

338
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,060
明天第一件事 在街上把话传开
Here, first thing tomorrow. Put word on the street.

339
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,570
这不太合规矩 特鲁夫人
That's not how it works, Mrs. True.

340
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,670
阿玛莉亚 乞丐王不会接受呼来喝去
Amalia, you don't just ask the Beggar King to come calling.

341
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,640
这也由不得他
I am, in fact, not asking.

342
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,360
好吧
All right.

343
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,140
我来给你看看伤口
Better tend to that scratch,

344
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,970
既然你忙着给自己树敌
since you're in such a hurry to make new enemies.

345
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
奥古斯都・毕德罗想见您 先生
Augustus Bidlow to see you, sir.

346
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,610
奥吉 抱歉让你久等了
Augie, sorry I kept you waiting.

347
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,730
你等很久了吗 我对时间不太敏感
Did I keep you waiting? I'm at odds with time.

348
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,930
它们不开心了
They're unhappy.

349
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,090
谁 汉弗莱斯一家吗 当然了 他们太老了
Who? The Humphries? Of course they're unhappy. They're old.

350
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,410
那些乌鸦
The crows.

351
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,090
-它们不该在此聚集  -乌鸦啊…
- They shouldn't be massing here. - Crows...

352
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,460
你是说我们在目击一群乌鸦吗
Do you mean to say we're witnessing a murder?

353
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,460
["murder"是一群乌鸦的集合名词]

354
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,190
你知道我讨厌这个词
You know I hate that term.

355
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,920
太不公平了 用谋杀形容"一群乌鸦"
So unfair, "a murder of crows."

356
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,120
乌鸦很可爱 它们是有灵性的动物
Crows are actually lovely. They're intelligent creatures.

357
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,910
为什么形容一群云雀用"欣喜"
Why is it an "exaltation of larks"?

358
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,910
["exaltation"是云雀的集合名词]

359
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,000
-云雀根本不是…  -不是社会性动物
- Larks are not at all as soc... - Not at all as social.

360
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,600
奥吉 你对鸟类术语的激进立场
Yes, Augie, your radical stance on avian nomenclature

361
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,030
-从你上伊顿公学时就没变过了  -谢谢 不用了
- hasn't changed since Eton. - No, thank you.

362
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,020
我认为它们正是在这附和你的不满
I think they're here as a Greek chorus to your distemper.

363
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,140
所以…你怎么就炸毛了
So... what has you so ruffled?

364
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,810
我猜你姐姐又生气了
I assume your sister is angry about something.

365
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,690
没有啊
No.

366
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,540
只是…我做了件蠢事
I just... I, I've done something stupid.

367
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,170
但这不是她…
And that's not why she's... Fu...

368
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,480
她…这个
She... This.

369
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,640
你知道拉维妮娅的慈善机构在忙啥吗
You know Lavinia's charity endeavor?

370
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,910
附魔之人
The Touched.

371
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,600
是的 那些…
Yes. The, uh...

372
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,540
-孤儿院  -对 是孤儿
- The Orphanage. - Orphans. Right.

373
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,130
-不啊 附魔之人  -是的 他们太可怕了
- No. The Touched. - Yes. They're terrible.

374
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,670
他们很棒
They're wonderful.

375
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,940
很 荒唐可笑
They're absurd.

376
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,460
你知道这个词是什么意思吗
Do you even know what the term means?

377
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,840
"附魔"吗 当然 不知道
"Touched"? Yes! No.

378
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,850
她们都是… 都有…
Uh, they're all, uh, they have,

379
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,230
奇奇怪怪的畸形和缺陷
uh, weird, um, deformities and afflictions.

380
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,370
对了…奥尔德顿・斯格罗夫有个会悬浮的侄女
And... Oh! Um. Alderton Musgrove has a niece who can float.

381
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,720
-真的吗  -是的
- Really? - Yeah.

382
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,120
离地三厘米左右吧
Just an inch or so off the ground.

383
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,420
除非你拖她 不然她哪也去不了
She can't go anywhere unless you tow her about.

384
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,620
斯格罗夫气坏了
Musgrove is apoplectic.

385
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,520
我都不该说出来的
I'm not supposed to tell.

386
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,600
拉维妮娅给她们找了个家
Oh, and, uh, Lavinia's opened a, a home for them.

387
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,980
-争议还挺大的...  -然后
- And it's all rather controversial, and... - And

388
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,790
她刚从管事的寡妇那儿
she, she, she just now got word

389
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,630
听到了一些谣传
from the widow who runs the affair.

390
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,300
一些被附魔的姑娘遭到了袭击
Some Touched girl was attacked.

391
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,370
女孩没事 但拉维妮娅气坏了
I mean, the girl's fine, but Lavinia, she's aflame.

392
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,250
"是时候让社会接受
"It's time society accepted

393
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,170
附魔之人就在你我之间 他们…"
that the Touched are amongst us, and they're... ".

394
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,410
但我说 "她们并不在我们之中
And I said, "Well, they're not amongst us.

395
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,860
她们在孤儿院呢"
You know, they're in The Orphanage."

396
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,870
然后她说我真是个天才
And she called me a genius.

397
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,560
这比她叫我蠢货还膈应 因为…
Which is worse than when she calls me an idiot, because...

398
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,750
我猜不透她…
I, I never know what she...

399
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,560
她要带她们去歌剧院
She's bringing them to the opera.

400
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,460
就今晚 坐我们的包厢
Tonight! In our box.

401
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,470
为了这些女人她把范・阿尔德斯夫妇都赶出去了
She's ousted the Van Alders for these wo-women.

402
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,110
让我去凑成四个人
I'm to make the fourth.

403
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,640
-她们长得很丑吗  -我不知道
- Are they hideous? - I've no idea.

404
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,360
就…
It's, um...

405
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,810
是那个寡妇 特鲁女士
It's, it's, it's the widow, Mrs. True,

406
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,340
应该吧 还有她的同伴
I think, and her companion.

407
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,950
你觉得她们会长得很丑吗
Do you think they might be hideous?

408
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,890
不管怎么样 和那个丑的调情
Well, whatever they are, flirt with the ugly one.

409
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,890
这会造就一种意想不到的和谐
It creates an unexpected balance.

410
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,820
我不知道要怎么调情
I don't know how to flirt.

411
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,670
老天啊 这些人让我觉得好不安
God, these people make me uneasy.

412
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,220
如果是那种扭曲畸形的女的呢
What if she's some sort of Elephant Man woman?

413
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,330
嗯 那她就是丑的那个了
Well, then, she's probably the ugly one.

414
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,420
你一定要来
You have to come.

415
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,290
去歌剧院吗
Oh! To the opera?

416
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,430
是啊 调情你最会了
Well, you know everything about flirting.

417
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,010
而且 你也不介意奇奇怪怪的人
Plus, you don't mind when people are odd.

418
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,990
所以我们才成了朋友
It's how we're friends.

419
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,220
但今晚演得是"浮士德"啊
But it's "Faust"!

420
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,190
拜托了
Please?

421
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,410
让我做什么都行 我是说...
I'll do anything. I mean...

422
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,470
就拉维尼亚对于这个团体的热情
People are already saying unkind things

423
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,690
已经有人开始嚼舌根了
about Lavinia's passion on the subject.

424
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,850
如果这事出个什么差错...
If this whole thing doesn't go smoothly...

425
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,270
我跟财政大臣还有个重要会议
I've got a very important meeting with the Minister of Finance

426
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,000
关于摆渡者的下一次午夜狂欢
about The Ferryman's next Midnight Carouse.

427
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,420
摆渡者 我不...
The Ferryman's? I don't...

428
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,810
等一下 财政大臣跟你的异教徒性爱俱乐部
Sorry, wh-what does the Minister of Finance have to do

429
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,570
有什么关系
with your pagan sex club?

430
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,830
他得做点什么
Whatever he has to do

431
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,150
才能从我手里拿到上次我拍的照片
to get the pictures I have from the last one.

432
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,070
俱乐部就是这么运作的
That's how the club works.

433
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,940
这挺微妙的
It's all quite delicate.

434
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,740
利益 威胁 然后
Favors and threats, and then,

435
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,190
一个逍遥法外的美好夜晚
one shining night where no law yet exists.

436
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,500
它不只是俱乐部 这是种社会思潮
It's more than just a club. It's an ethos.

437
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,650
我不会跟一群我认识且厌恶的人一起
And I won't sit through three hours of moralistic bellowing

438
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,140
忍受三个小时的道德洗礼
with everyone I know and hate,

439
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,700
就因为拉维妮娅变得神经兮兮
just because Lavinia's gone weird.

440
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,250
她没有神经兮兮
She's not weird.

441
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,210
是我粗俗了
I'm an ape.

442
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,610
-但她确实对你呼来喝去  -我知道
- But she does push you around. - I know.

443
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,610
我懂
I know.

444
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,400
我今晚会去的
I will come tonight.

445
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,100
-只要...  -不是 我吗
- If... - No. Me?

446
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,270
参加摆渡者 不行 雨果 求你了 我...
At The Ferryman's? No. Hugo, no. Please. I...

447
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,020
性爱俱乐部是...
Sex club is just...

448
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,260
就是更可怕级别的调情
That's just flirting on a much scarier level.

449
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,050
你不需要去调情
You don't have to flirt.

450
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,120
你只要放松
You just have to relax.

451
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,320
然后忍受别人来撩你就行
Endure someone flirting with you.

452
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,600
这是我的条件
These are my terms.

453
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,040
真是个呆子
Oh, he's a pokey one.

454
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,850
对这个社会而言
As far as society is concerned,

455
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,560
奥古斯都・毕德罗无可指摘
Augustus Bidlow is above reproach,

456
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,410
也让人不屑一顾
and beneath contempt.

457
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,840
-他很完美  -对什么来说
- He's perfect. - For what?

458
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,150
你不用再扮女仆了
You don't have to wear that anymore.

459
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,220
啊对 你就是女仆
Oh. Right. You are the maid.

460
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,340
我喜欢看你工作
I like watching you work.

461
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,260
好像你在指挥一样
It's like you're conducting.

462
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,860
乞丐王那儿再出点岔子
Well, get in wrong with the Beggar King,

463
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,670
你就能听上交响曲了
and you'll get a symphony.

464
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,580
你这真是大材小用
You shouldn't be in that life.

465
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,280
你这天赋 你应该成为皇家御医
Gift like yours, you should be the Royal physician,

466
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,570
而不是给黑帮和怪胎们包扎
not patching up gangsters and freaks.

467
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,130
我这天赋给了我个巫医的招牌
Gift like mine gets me branded a voodoo witch doctor.

468
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,910
我也不挑三拣四了
I gave up being choosy.

469
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,900
都不说一句我不是怪胎吗
Nothing about me not being a freak?

470
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,060
别 进来吧 做个手术而已
Oh, no, just come in. It's only surgery.

471
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,410
这下好了
Oh, right.

472
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,440
我天晚上要去歌剧院
I'm going to the opera tonight.

473
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,170
我预见过这场景
I had a rippling.

474
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,440
"同我与我弟弟奥古斯都
"to accompany me and my brother Augustus

475
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,890
前往'浮士德'的开幕演出
to the opening performance of 'Faust.'

476
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,050
拉维妮娅・毕德罗"
Lavinia Bidlow."

477
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,020
所以你刚说你被人攻击了
So you send word that you'd just been attacked,

478
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,970
她就说"出来玩啊"
and she says, "Come out to play."

479
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,760
她连礼服都送来了
She even sent an outfit.

480
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,880
你不是还要养伤口呢吗
And what about the part where you rest?

481
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,080
我是去剧院 不是去干苦力
It's the theater, not hard labor.

482
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,810
而且 我... 觉得我需要到场
And I... Think I need to be there.

483
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,560
有麻烦吗
Trouble?

484
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,870
凯瑟琳马上准备好晚饭了
Katherine will have supper ready soon.

485
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,810
拉维妮娅觉得我穿得进这个
Does Lavinia really think I can fit into this?

486
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,340
这裙子很适合你
It's a good dress for you.

487
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,180
能帮忙压住伤口
It'll keep pressure on the wound.

488
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,890
-特鲁夫人  -阿代尔小姐
- Mrs. True. - Miss Adair.

489
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,770
你看起来真美
You look very fine.

490
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,520
我也这么觉得
I think so, too.

491
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,740
就像是故事书里的角色
It's like something from a storybook.

492
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,640
我觉得行屈膝礼有点困难
I'm not confident in my curtsying.

493
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,240
我觉得呼吸有点困难
I'm not confident in my breathing.

494
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,890
我都没打算喘气
Oh, I wasn't planning to breathe.

495
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,560
我觉得这会不太得体
I think it's considered rude.

496
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,870
-疼吗  -有点痒
- Does it hurt? - Itches.

497
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,690
那更糟糕
Aah, that's much worse.

498
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,520
你确定我们一定要去吗
Are you sure we need to go to this?

499
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,180
务必说是 不然我现在就哭 但...
You have to say yes or I'll cry, but...

500
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,820
我们必须要去
We need to go to this.

501
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,250
真想知道原因
Wish I knew why.

502
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,310
我们单独聊聊
Give us the room.

503
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,740
那是奥迪恩 原谅那臭味
That's Odium. Pardon the stench.

504
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,420
他根本就不愿意去洗澡
You cannot get that man into a bath.

505
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,520
德克兰・奥林
Declan Orrun.

506
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,070
乞丐王
The Beggar King.

507
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,680
或者...不是
Or, no...

508
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,040
-奥林先生 派南斯・阿代尔  -嗯 我认识
- Mr. Orrun, Penance Adair. - Yeah, I know.

509
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,700
-伟大的女发明家  -我没那么厉害
- The great inventress. - Oh, I'm not great.

510
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,960
-我猜你听说了...  -你知道现在是什么情况了吗
-I assume you've heard about... -Do you know how it looks?

511
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,610
街上人尽皆知 你对我呼来喝去
Every rum on the street hearing you calling me

512
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,390
就跟喊条母狗一样
come like a bitch puppy?

513
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,500
-我们有沟通渠道的  -我们今天遇袭了
- There's channels. - We were attacked today.

514
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,710
就一回
Only once?

515
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,520
他们跟我们同一时间去找了桃金娘・哈普利琪
They came for Myrtle Haplisch same time we did.

516
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,340
可能追踪改造人已有一段时间
Probably been after the Touched for some time,

517
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,850
但现在被我们发现了
but now they've been seen.

518
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,780
这对我们来说是个威胁 我不得不怀疑
They're a danger to us, and I'd suspect,

519
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,000
任何和我们有联系的人
anyone known to be connected with us.

520
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,010
所以你就把我们的关系搞得人尽皆知
Which you made sure I was known far and wide to be.

521
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,200
你唤我出来 让我只能帮你
You called me out, so I'd be forced to help you.

522
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,090
现在你还当面说了出来
And now you've told me that to my face.

523
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,640
我真的绞尽脑汁在想这事要怎么发展
I'm genuinely searching for a way that this spins out

524
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,740
我才不用杀了你
that I don't kill you.

525
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,230
你不杀我的结局会更好
It would be better if you didn't.

526
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,770
你这娘们可少见
You're a rare fuckin' bird.

527
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,960
你把桃金娘的消息卖给我们
You sold us the information about Myrtle.

528
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,400
然后你在想我是不是还卖给了其他人
And you're wondering if I sold it to someone else.

529
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,800
那你想去吧 小公主
Well, wonder away, princess.

530
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,780
那是我的生意
My business is mine.

531
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,510
除了我那神圣和谐的婚姻
Apart from the sanctity of my harmonious marriage,

532
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,980
专一什么的就是扯淡
fuck-all is exclusive.

533
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,580
我的姑娘们需要保护 而我需要消息
My girls need protection, and I need information.

534
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,200
我要独家情报 谁在追踪附魔之人以及原因
Exclusive, about who's hunting the Touched, and why.

535
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,890
别装模作样了 你开个价吧
Skip the posture and name your price.

536
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,660
你付不起这个价
You ain't got that kind of swag.

537
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,080
我们财源丰厚
We're resourceful.

538
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,690
是吗 你们能给我弄个王冠宝石吗
Is that so? How 'bout you get me the Crown fucking Jewels?

539
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,310
等等 不会来真的吧
Wait, are you considering that?

540
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,130
我们会先送你一份礼物 为今天的鲁莽赔罪
We'll start with a gift for today's thoughtlessness.

541
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,570
一辆自动马车 专为您设计
An automated motor-carriage, designed to your specifications.

542
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,240
你若帮忙 还会有酬劳
And you will be paid, if you help us.

543
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,650
你足够疯狂 值得一试
You're mad enough to make this worth it.

544
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,720
但因此你也有可能搞砸
But you're mad enough to try not to.

545
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,800
如果那样 我就把你的脸划烂
If it goes that way, I will cut your face to a mess.

546
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,830
这不是我的脸
This isn't my face.

547
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,030
我还以为你能吓唬到她们
I thought you was gonna scare them.

548
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,070
把手指伸开
Spread out your fingers.

549
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,480
-等等  -把手举起来
- Wait. - Hold up your hand,

550
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,020
他妈把手指给我张开了
and spread out your fuckin' fingers.

551
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,770
雨果 下来
Hugo, get off!

552
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,420
我要上台了
I have to go!

553
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,300
我第五幕洞穴芭蕾舞后就结束了
I'm done after the cavern ballet in act five,

554
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,950
就监狱那幕之前
right before the prison scene.

555
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,810
雨果 你在听吗
Hugo? You listening?

556
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,110
当然 监狱那幕
Yes. The prison scene.

557
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,260
没错
Yes.

558
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,130
你觉得呢 毕德罗小姐
Don't you agree, Miss Bidlow?

559
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,700
你非得跟我咬文嚼字吗
Must we fight a war over words?

560
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,940
我真是受够了那些危言耸听
I'm exhausted by these overwrought alarums

561
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,250
说我们的语言要被法语化了
about the Frenchification of our language.

562
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,250
这都到世纪末了
It's the end of the century.

563
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,010
这种根深蒂固的偏见一无是处
These ancient prejudices have no use.

564
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,210
贝尔登医生
Dr. Beldon,

565
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,420
想必涉及到你的精神分析实践
you adopt new terms as they become relevant

566
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,250
你经常会用到新的词汇
to your practice of psychoanalysis, I imagine.

567
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,380
近来每周如此
Practically every week of late.

568
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,240
语言所求的不是停滞 而是准确
Language requires not stasis, but specificity.

569
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,530
若能删掉”挺好“一词 我就太开心了
I should be thrilled to excise the word "nice."

570
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,290
这词像浆糊一样含混 对吧 奥古斯都
It's vague as paste. Isn't that right, Augustus?

571
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,460
奥古斯都
Augustus.

572
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,520
-抱歉  -我们之前还在说呢
- Sorry? - We were discussing it earlier.

573
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,160
现代语言的准确性
The specificity of modern language.

574
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,460
对对对 没错 
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

575
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,920
挺好
It's very nice.

576
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,890
如果你们讨论的是法语词
If it's, uh, French terminology we're discussing,

577
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,340
那我想说 有些法语词
there are a few terms

578
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,960
在英语中 没有对应词
we Britons simply don't have a word for.

579
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,410
失陪一下
Oh, excuse me.

580
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,360
我想大家都知道他指的什么词
I suppose we all know the sort of terms he means.

581
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,270
斯旺来这里干什么
What on Earth is Swann doing here?

582
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,310
我... 不 我知道
I... No, I know.

583
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,190
太冲动了...
S-so impulsive...

584
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,140
马森勋爵 一切可好
Lord Massen. You're well, I hope.

585
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,630
毕德罗小姐 我很好 谢谢 贝尔登医生 斯旺 你好
I am, Miss Bidlow. Thank you. Dr. Beldon, hello. Swann.

586
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,370
我们正在讨论几个老家伙
We were discussing the panic a few old men are having

587
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,260
对法语词的恐惧心理
about certain French terms.

588
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,230
国会上也争论过类似话题 是缘起哪个词呢
There was one debated on the Parliament floor. What was it?

589
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,010
"雇员"
"Employees."

590
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,250
雇员 用这词不也没事吗
Employees. And here we say it, and yet live.

591
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,290
这是厌恶 而不是恐慌
It is not panicking to abhor something.

592
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,930
用外来的花言巧语
Neither is it useful to replace

593
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,230
[盎格鲁撒克逊语]

594
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,230
去代替完美的古英语
a perfectly good Anglo-Saxon word

595
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,110
并没有什么帮助
with some foreigner's flourish.

596
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,240
在英国 我们说"受雇者"
In England, we say "the employed."

597
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,540
替换成"雇员"有什么好处呢
What possible benefit in replacing it with "employees"?

598
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,700
单数形式
The singular.

599
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,110
我们可以指代一名雇员
One may refer to a single employee,

600
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,560
但是"受雇者"
whereas "the employed"

601
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,470
只能表示一个群体
can only be used to describe a mass of people.

602
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,830
它否定了单个劳动者
It doesn't allow for the idea that a single worker

603
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,670
也可以是完整而有意义的存在
may be a whole and meaningful being.

604
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,370
这是阿玛莉亚・特鲁夫人 阿代尔小姐
Mrs. Amalia True. Miss Adair.

605
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,570
我介绍一下 这是马森勋爵
May I introduce Lord Massen?

606
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,470
-特鲁夫人在打理孤儿院  -的确
- Mrs. True runs The Orphanage. - Indeed.

607
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,010
哪一个是长得丑的
Which one's the ugly one?

608
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,990
我想 你们也是
I take it then that you are yourselves

609
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,320
其中染病的一员吧
among the afflicted?

610
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,610
附魔之人 是的 但我们未受其扰
Touched, yes. We don't consider ourselves afflicted.

611
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,400
或许就病症而言 有些女性
Perhaps some women are more fortunate

612
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,850
比其他的更幸运一些
in the nature of their ailment than others.

613
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,420
话是没错 但
That's true, but,

614
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,840
她们遭受的痛苦更多来自社会偏见
more suffer from society's perception

615
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,290
而非自身的不适
than their own debilitation.

616
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,670
你们都有些什么毛病
Well, so what's wrong with you?

617
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,870
他是在说我呢
I, I think he means me.

618
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,870
-怎么说呢...  -不 你们看上去... 
- Uh, where to begin... - No, it's just, you, you lo... you, you look...

619
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,640
挺好的
You're qu... You're quite nice.

620
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,750
你还在打理孤儿院
And you, um, y-you have the charity, The Orphanage.

621
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,890
看上去... 很正常
That seems... normal.

622
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,760
是毕德罗小姐经营孤儿院
Miss Bidlow runs The Orphanage.

623
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,240
我们只是受雇者
We're just the employed.

624
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,870
很令人震惊 但我弟弟说出了所有人的疑问
Shockingly, I'd say my brother has spoken for everyone.

625
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,870
他们急切想知道你们的"转变"是什么
They're anxious to know what your "turns" are.

626
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,690
-”转变“就是耍把戏  -不是把戏 
- A "turn" is a trick. - It's not a trick.

627
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,860
派南斯擅长发明 是创造者
Penance is an inventor. A creator, really.

628
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,090
世上只有一个造物主
Oh. There's only one Creator.

629
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,080
我看得见能量
No, uh, I can see energy.

630
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,940
势能 就像电能
Potential energy. Like with electricity.

631
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,650
我能看到能量想往哪儿走
I can see where it wants to go, or,

632
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,070
是移动还是停滞
move, or settle.

633
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,860
这能帮助我组建一些东西
It helps me put things together.

634
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,450
你呢
And yours?

635
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,980
特鲁太太往往能走在我们前头
Mrs. True tends to be a few steps ahead of the rest of us.

636
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,430
预言家
A prognosticator.

637
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,580
没那么了不起
Nothing so grand.

638
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,280
所以我没法了解我的死因
So I shouldn't ask how I'm going to die.

639
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,930
不 但肯定会涉及到某个法语词
No, but one can safely assume it will involve a French word.

640
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,450
-你能看到未来  -片段而已
- You see the future? - Snippets.

641
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,120
有所帮助 但也会带来困惑
It's as confusing as it is useful.

642
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,680
你曾是一名军人
You were a soldier.

643
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,990
必然见过有人突然感觉自己回到了战场
You've seen men who suddenly feel themselves back in battle.

644
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,470
对我来说 就像是去到了未来
Well, sometimes I go forward.

645
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,410
我没说我是军人
I never said I was a soldier.

646
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,280
-也许你马上会说  -不 是你的眼睛
- You're probably going to. - No, it's the eyes.

647
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,090
一直在评估周边的威胁
Assessing every threat.

648
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,270
马森勋爵是抵御现代化侵害的...
Lord Massen is the last line of defense

649
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,680
最后一道防线
against the scourge of modernity.

650
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,570
我老了 见证了太多改变
I'm old and I've seen too much change

651
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,220
并不足以时代洪流 可是
to fight against the tide, but, uh,

652
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,250
混乱不是变化
chaos is not change.

653
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,960
群体靠大声疾呼来寻求认可并不代表他们值得
Shouting for recognition does not make a people worthy of it.

654
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,240
世界的和谐才是我们最该守护的
There's a harmony to our world that's worth preserving.

655
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,080
我认为
As I understand it,

656
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,380
和谐是由不同声音
a harmony is made up of different voices

657
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,680
发出的不同音符构成的
sounding different notes.

658
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,950
没错 但主音只有一个
Yes. And one is always above the other.

659
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,870
女士们 失陪
Ladies.

660
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,290
我杀死了恶魔
I killed the devil.

661
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,800
是玛拉黛
It's Maladie!

662
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,780
玛拉黛在此
It is Maladie!

663
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,510
她想干什么
What does she want?

664
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,190
没人说声"谢谢"吗
Is no one going to say "thank you"?

665
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,840
没事 没事
It's okay. It's okay.

666
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,910
没事的
It's okay.

667
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,400
没事的 花瓣 不是你的错
It's okay, petal. It's not your fault.

668
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,130
是医生的错
It's the doctor.

669
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,410
人可真多啊
Oh! Oh, there's so many people.

670
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,720
你们来的时候都戴帽子了吗
Did you all come in hats?

671
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,000
现在你们头上空空荡荡 对吗
Now all of your brains are naked. No?

672
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,180
你们就该戴着鳗鱼花冠
You shall have a wreath of eels

673
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,850
鱼尾伸进你们的嘴里
with the tail in your mouth.

674
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,470
求求你
Please!

675
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,240
求求你
Please.

676
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,810
别...走
Don't... go.

677
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,710
恶魔的特产就是鳗鱼
Devil's speciality is eels.

678
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,090
就是你们认为的毒蛇
Which is known by you as a serpent.

679
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,770
但只是亚当
Oh, but it's only Adam.

680
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,460
它们滑行起来时都一样
It's all the same when it slithers.

681
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,700
夏娃长着逼
Eve had a cunt.

682
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,700
我为什么在这里
Why am I here?

683
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,200
我是来杀一个天使女巫
I came to kill an angel witch.

684
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,160
不好意思
Oops.

685
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,570
可我离得越近 我越觉得
But the closer I came, the more I felt

686
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,350
我来这里...
I was here for a r...

687
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:27,610
因为我... 看见了上帝
Because I... saw God.

688
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,010
k散发着光芒
He was all light.

689
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,240
k为我带上了花冠 他来过
And He put on me His wreath. He came.

690
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,530
他来过所有人身边
He came to us all,

691
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,990
你们却对k不理不睬
and you all turned your backs on Him.

692
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,550
你们撒谎 你们说k从未来过 
You lied. You said He never.

693
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,110
但k会低哼
But He makes hum.

694
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,250
k会歌唱
Oh, He sings.

695
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,500
我唱不出那样的声音
I could never make it out,

696
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,240
可我能感受到k的低哼
but I feel His hum,

697
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,150
就像喉咙中有把梳子
like a comb in my throat.

698
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,610
我能感受到
And I feel it.

699
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,970
我感受到了
I feel it.

700
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,780
k 就在这里
Him. Here.

701
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,510
是谁... 是谁...
Who... Who...

702
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,410
管他妈的 把天使杀了
Ah, bugger it. Take the angel.

703
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,770
什么都没有吗
Oh, nothing?

704
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,040
有人吗 告诉我你想要什么
Anyone? Tell me what you want!

705
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,460
我来这儿要么有原因 要么就是要烧了它
Either I am here for a reason, or for a bonfire.

706
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,400
不 她摔下去了
Oh, no! She fell!

707
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,180
有老鼠 小老鼠
Mice. Tiny mice.

708
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,930
你的鸡巴怎么还硬着
How is that still hard?

709
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,350
-快走  -他妈的
- Go. - Damn it.

710
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,640
快 别停
Come on, don't stop.

711
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,670
把她给我
Just let me have the girl.

712
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,870
把她给我...
Just let me have the girl...

713
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:13,670
不
No.

714
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,170
看你闯的祸 小夜莺
Well, you've made a mess, little songbird.

715
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,460
老大...
Boss...

716
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,460
雨果・斯旺
Hugo Swann.

717
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,880
斯旺勋爵
Lord Swann.

718
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,370
我就不计较你这次失礼了
But I'll overlook the breach this once.

719
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,670
我相信你这段时间过得很不容易
I'm sure this must be a very difficult time for you.

720
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,040
完全相反
On the contrary.

721
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,370
伦敦那个杀人如麻的疯子离我就像基蒂这么近
London's deadliest maniac was as close to me as Kitty is now.

722
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,860
-是凯蒂  -突然降临的死亡
- It's Katie. - And the presence of sudden death

723
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,260
让人更珍惜活着的时候
makes one appreciate the act of living.

724
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,460
他看起来是挺珍惜的
He did seem to appreciate it.

725
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,210
我要单独和勋爵谈谈 凯蒂
I'll need to interview his lordship alone, Katie.

726
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,710
-我不明白...  -这样能快一点
- I don't see why... -It'll be quicker.

727
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:57,120
但请不要离开剧院
But don't leave the theater, please.

728
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,770
我永远不会离开剧院的...
Oh, I could never leave the theater...

729
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:05,170
我想你根本没有尝试
So I don't suppose you made any effort

730
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,960
阻止玛拉黛
to stop Maladie.

731
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:11,540
我以为那是... 你的工作
I have it that that's... your job.

732
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,000
是那个小寡妇替你做的
Oh, and that there's a young widow doing it for you.

733
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,550
阿玛莉亚・特鲁
Amalia True.

734
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:21,160
拉维妮娅・毕德罗的客人 管理孤儿院
Guest of Lavinia Bidlow. Runs The Orphanage.

735
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,880
玛拉黛绑架了一个姑娘 特鲁夫人一直在追
Maladie kidnapped a girl. Mrs. True gave chase.

736
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,210
不幸之人的捍卫者
Champion of the unfortunate,

737
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,180
她还打倒了那个危险的男人
and she knocks dangerous men about.

738
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,930
你很幸运她不知道你们的算盘
Then I guess you're lucky she don't know what you're up to.

739
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,240
是我们
What we're up to.

740
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,570
我可把你当做伙伴
I think of you as a partner, in a way.

741
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,700
我没从这事里牟利
I don't profit by what we do.

742
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,390
我也没有
Well, neither do I.

743
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,010
还没有
Yet.

744
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,790
只要你送来足够多的漂亮姑娘
Once you've sent enough suitable girls my way,

745
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,750
有投资人的投资
and a certain investor is invested,

746
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,390
那摆渡者俱乐部
The Ferryman's Club will become

747
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,810
将不只是个盈利生意 还能有现象级的影响
not just a profitable business, but a phenomenon.

748
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,860
我甚至对一些债务视而不见
I might even forget a few debts.

749
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,950
快他妈把香槟喝了 弗兰克
Take the fucking champagne, Frank.

750
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,280
你会想要的
You'll want it.

751
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,650
我知道玛拉黛带走的女孩的名字
You see, I know the name of the girl Maladie took.

752
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,360
你也知道
And so do you.

753
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,630
通晓各种语言
One little polyglot.

754
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,870
一个被附魔的小女孩
One tiny Touched girl.

755
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,830
把她给我带来就行
That's all you had to bring me.

756
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,250
我喜欢这个词 "被附魔"
I like that word. "Touched."

757
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,470
就像上帝之手轻轻点了某些人
Like the finger of God gave a few of us a little poke.

758
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,830
将我们唤醒
Woke us up.

759
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,420
每个实验对象都让我离找出
Every subject gets me closer to finding exactly

760
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,740
被k触碰的位置更进一步
where it is He touched us.

761
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,320
但今天不是
Not today, though.

762
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:03,060
不 今天就先看看哪里会疼
No. Today let's just see where it hurts.

763
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,410
让他住手 乔治
Stop him, George!

764
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,770
就放在他夹克兜里
He's got it in his jacket pocket!

765
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,670
反正我们也不想要
We didn't want it anyway!

766
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,280
该死的婊子
Fucking tart!

767
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,480
那疯子是你朋友吗
Oi. Is that maniac a friend of yours?

768
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,170
阿玛莉亚
Amalia?

769
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,360
特鲁夫人
Mrs. True?

770
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:58,970
阿代尔
Miss Adair.

771
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,190
-你看起来...  -我...
- You look very... - I've...

772
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,400
刚打了一架
Got into a fight.

773
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,440
已经一天了
It's been a day for that.

774
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,570
我输了
I didn't win.

775
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,820
玛拉黛把小姑娘抢走了
Maladie has the girl.

776
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,760
他们说她叫玛丽・布莱顿
Mary. Brighton, they said.

777
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,520
她不会杀她的
She won't kill her.

778
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,210
不会立马就杀 我们还有时间
Not right away. We have time.

779
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,310
我们... 还有时间
We... have some time.

780
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,340
你找到了很刺激的方法打发时间
And you've found an invigorating way to spend it.

781
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,740
是他们先动手的
They started it.

782
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,560
-不 是我先开始的  -我知道
- No, I started it. - I know.

783
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,870
我明白 麻烦会让你苦恼
I know. Trouble makes you troublesome.

784
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:57,140
但没什么比好运更能激发你
But nothing sets you off like good fortune.

785
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,580
玛丽的歌
Mary's song.

786
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,210
直击我的内心
Reachin' right into me.

787
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,690
告诉我 我在这里
Tellin' me that that I'm here.

788
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,080
我属于这里
I belong here.

789
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,540
还有你
And you.

790
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:25,870
而且... 我们都被附魔
And... all of us that's Touched.

791
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,540
我们都被编入世界的网络之中
We're woven into the fabric of the world,

792
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,850
我们注定就是如此
and we're meant to be as we are.

793
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,200
我们会找到玛丽 让她歌唱
We find Mary. We get her singin'.

794
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,820
他们会来到我们身边 就能安全
They'll all come to us, and they'll be safe.

795
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,490
他们并不安全
They won't be safe.

796
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,000
至少不那么孤单
Less lonely, then.

797
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,080
这是个开始
And that's a start.

798
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,040
是个开始
It's a start.
