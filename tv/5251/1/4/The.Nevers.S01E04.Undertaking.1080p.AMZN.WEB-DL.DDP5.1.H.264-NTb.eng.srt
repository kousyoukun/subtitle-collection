1
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:06,988
<i>I want you to join us.</i>

2
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:10,279
<i>Is that the mission
you were going on about?</i>

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,822
You still feel it.
Mary's song.

4
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,071
You know what a better world
could be like.

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:19,405
<i>First time Mary sang,</i>

6
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:21,738
<i>only the Touched that were
in the room could hear it.</i>

7
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,738
<i>We'll make Mary's voice
loud enough</i>

8
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:26,321
<i>that it could be heard
by Touched across the city.</i>

9
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,446
<i>We need to get
those fliers taken down.</i>

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,738
They could be all over London.

11
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,279
DÉSIREÉ <i>What did they do to the girls?</i>

12
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:32,279
<i>Experiments.</i>

13
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:34,279
<i>We need to know
everything they've been doing.</i>

14
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:35,613
Oh! Who are you?

15
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:42,655
<i>The Order
is to eliminate Maladie.</i>

16
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:44,363
<i>Maladie has done us a favor.</i>

17
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:46,279
She turned sentiment
against the Touched.

18
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:50,113
<i>We're being attacked, locked up,
and thrown in the street.</i>

19
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:52,488
<i>We have enemies
you don't know about yet.</i>

20
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:03,780
<i>The Touched,
they'll all come to us.</i>

21
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,321
<i>They'll be safe.</i>

40
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:06,738
-Witches!
-Freaks!

41
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:09,571
-Why don't we drown
you all? Ha, ha!
-Good riddance!

42
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,863
Drown her!
Let's see if she floats!

43
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:15,029
-Vile creatures!
-Go on, piss off!

44
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:17,238
Please, Inspector. Not now.

45
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,238
Not here.

46
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,571
-You're under arrest.
-Come on, you two.

47
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:20,571
There we go...

48
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,405
I know your loss is greater
than any of us

49
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:25,822
-can even...
-Where the fuck is she?

50
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:29,446
Where's the lady
who can see the future?

51
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:05,279
A kiss for a pint.
That was the deal.

52
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,196
I am a woman of my word.

53
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,029
Kiss for a pint.

54
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:17,571
Oh, no, you fucking don't--

55
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:36,697
-I'm gonna need you in a minute.

56
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,822
Who speaks for these men?

57
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,530
Him, m'lord.

58
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:14,071
Jacobs.

59
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:17,154
The men learnt there
are explosives among
the cargo here.

60
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:19,947
They feel they're due
higher wages for
handling them.

61
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,988
Who here knows what this is?

62
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,863
Well, that's a shell, sir.

63
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,738
Loaded with cordite.
Ready for the war.

64
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:52,071
Top marks.

65
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:55,405
It's good for
blowing up the enemy,

66
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,113
and for saving our lads.

67
00:06:57,196 --> 00:07:00,530
That's who you're holding
hostage here. Your brothers.

68
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:02,029
That doesn't change the facts--

69
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:04,071
Jesus!

70
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,238
If they were unstable,

71
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:11,071
we would simply
roll them over the line,

72
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,863
wouldn't we?

73
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:16,822
You men are seeking
a grievance.

74
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:21,113
The docks are full of men
who care about our troops,

75
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:23,863
and foreigners who
care about nothing.

76
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:26,530
I can fill your jobs in an hour!

77
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:31,613
Get back to work,
and I will forget
this happened.

78
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:33,321
No repercussions.

79
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:37,029
You won't be docked
for this stoppage.

80
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,571
It's very generous.

81
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,947
Go on. Go on. Back to work.

82
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,863
Go on. Go on.

83
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,697
Next time, come and talk
to me as individuals.

84
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,113
To band together
when you could stand alone?

85
00:07:57,196 --> 00:08:00,863
I expect more courage
from Englishmen.

86
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,822
They're taking the carrot,
my lord.

87
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:11,863
They're mouthing the carrot.

88
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:15,738
They spit it back out,
we'll use the stick.

89
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,238
I thought Aneel was with you.

90
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,321
He had to get back to school.

91
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,947
I mean, he gets to.

92
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,488
If you're up to it,
I need a favor.

93
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:38,154
-The new folk,

94
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:41,488
there's rumors one or two
have outstanding warrants.

95
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,488
Petty charges, likely cooked up.

96
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:46,822
Oh. It should mostly
just be fines, I imagine.

97
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:49,947
Some of them might not
technically be citizens.

98
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,947
-They don't all speak English,
so it's hard to tell.

99
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,863
I don't know if that matters,
but I'll find out.

100
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:59,405
-You're a daisy.
-I'd rather be a barrister.

101
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,905
Then I could prosecute
the men...

102
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:04,863
I don't see how, though.

103
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:08,571
I can't even apply
to Aneel's school.

104
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,446
How are we ever
gonna see justice

105
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,613
if we're not a part of justice?

106
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:21,863
All I can see my way
through is a grape.

107
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:30,780
You know you're gonna have to
clean up those shards, right?

108
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,488
Yeah.

109
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,029
So, is this what we can expect?

110
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,405
A leader who doesn't lead?

111
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,238
Are you looking to
fill that position?

112
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:47,738
She does have
the nicest room.

113
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,988
You know True
should have been there.

114
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:52,196
I've shown more respect for
Mary, and I'm her kidnapper.

115
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,071
Amalia misses the point
of things, as often as not.

116
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:58,988
But if that chair is warm
when she sits in it,

117
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:00,279
she'll know why.

118
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:02,238
You don't think I can best her?

119
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:04,196
I don't think you want her job.

120
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,530
-It's very draining.

121
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:11,196
Did you see anyone
out of place at the funeral?

122
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,196
Not Maladie. None of the gang.

123
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,196
Beggar King sent a wreath.

124
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,154
-The great big one?
-She lost a friend.

125
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:18,613
She didn't win the Derby.

126
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:20,697
Big one wasn't signed.

127
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,863
Couple of Purists making a fuss.

128
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:24,321
You probably saw.

129
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:25,530
The pink rags.

130
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:28,530
-Purists all have them.
-So they have a name now?

131
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:30,905
-Christ preserve us.
-Thought that was my job.

132
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:34,697
-We don't want more violence.
-This is London, Doctor.

133
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,780
There's always more.

134
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:40,571
I still don't see how you can
go from working for Maladie...

135
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:44,154
to being here with Amalia.

136
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,947
You really think
they're that different?

137
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,071
True still not back?

138
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:51,488
I swear to Jesus, I would--

139
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:54,405
Have you not finished
discussing my faults?

140
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,488
Come on, Penance. Jesus awaits.

141
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,154
He already knows
what I was gonna say,

142
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,279
and I'll add a few
Hail Marys for that later.

143
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,822
Frank Mundi'll owe
a few himself, poor man.

144
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:04,571
Maladie didn't show
at the funeral.

145
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:06,363
Can you believe
the rudeness
of that woman?

146
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,029
It'd be madness to show,
and not her kind.

147
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:12,113
The papers that bothered
to report on the shootin'
are all blamin' her,

148
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,571
and we don't know
that we shouldn't be.

149
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,029
I still thought she might go.

150
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:16,988
So why didn't you?

151
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:19,863
The man who tried to drown me
is Nicholas Perbal.

152
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,154
Ach. That brute?

153
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:22,905
The blasphemy of
walking on water

154
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:24,154
for the purpose of murder...

155
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:25,321
He's called Odium.

156
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:27,697
Not by his dear Granny Perbal,

157
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,446
who owns a snug little attic
somewhere in the narrows.

158
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,613
Beggar King's man
says he's convalescing,
likely at Gran's.

159
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,154
Do violins cost a lot?

160
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:38,238
The two attacks
could be unrelated,
you and Mary.

161
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:41,863
-Lot of people don't like you,
I'm told.
-I know.

162
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:44,488
<i>...a casualty of war...</i>

163
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:51,113
I need a bath.

164
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,863
Tell Lucy we're meeting
in an hour.

165
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:54,405
Start listing suspects.

166
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,279
But she's broken up
worst of all the girls.

167
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:57,988
We'll take her mind off it.

168
00:11:58,071 --> 00:12:00,988
It's all hands on deck,
and she has the best hands
in the group.

169
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:02,780
In the meantime...

170
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:05,488
Make yourself comfortable.

171
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,446
Ah, True, sure and you
should've been at the service.

172
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,279
You're a bitter poor
example to the girls.

173
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:16,321
But I'm so tough and mean,
and I hate sentiment.

174
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:18,029
And also people. And myself.

175
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,238
Ah, Lord, Mary Brighton
trusted you,

176
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:24,238
-and you failed her.
Is that what you think?

177
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,405
I think the longer
we wait to find the killer,

178
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:28,238
the greater the chance
we never do.

179
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:30,571
Mary doesn't need me
crying over her corpse.

180
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,655
True, I can't imagine how many
funerals you've been to, but--

181
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:36,071
None. We don't do that
when I'm from.

182
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,238
We don't have enough time and
we don't have enough ground.

183
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,321
You know better than
anyone what pain does

184
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:41,613
when you don't
make time for it.

185
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:43,947
All time does is run out.

186
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,279
I was left here,
completely alone,

187
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,613
with nothing but a mission
I was never actually given.

188
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,071
No orders, no objectives--

189
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:52,738
They left me here
and they fucked right off.

190
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,113
Maybe they died.
Who cares? I'm here...

191
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:58,071
where a woman can be killed
just for having a voice,

192
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,738
which will be
the world's fucking epitaph

193
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,363
if I can't do something
other than make it worse.

194
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:04,071
I know your burdens, True.
But is vengeance

195
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:05,405
going to make the world better?

196
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,655
If we-- if we find out
who took away our Mary,

197
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:09,571
I have a worry as to
your next course of action,

198
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,113
because the rest of us,
we had a chance to say goodbye--

199
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:13,697
to remember the goodness
of her heart,

200
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,947
and not just the unfairness
of her being taken.

201
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,446
You keep saying taken
instead of murdered.
Mary was murdered.

202
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,988
-I was there, True.
-So was the man with the gun.

203
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:23,655
He was set up
before we got there.

204
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:27,279
So stop worrying about
who wasn't at the funeral,

205
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,822
and start asking who
wasn't at that park.

206
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,655
You don't mean one of us.

207
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:34,822
Well, I know it wasn't me.

208
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,571
Myrtle?

209
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,613
Do you want to talk?

210
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:21,238
May I see?

211
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,613
Oh, Myrtle.

212
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,446
-This is so--

213
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:49,655
You... heard her?

214
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:51,363
You wish you could hear her.

215
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:01,655
-You want to learn to read?

216
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,905
-Mary sang to you.

217
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:06,488
To... I'm trying.

218
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,947
Mary sang to you.

219
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:16,405
To this person.

220
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:19,738
About this person?

221
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:22,154
When Mary sang, you heard...

222
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,947
Words.

223
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:27,863
Language.

224
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:30,697
Mary was telling us something,
and you understood it.

225
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,697
Was it something nice?

226
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,113
So now you're after
our jobs as well?

227
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,822
What angle are you pursuing?

228
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:06,988
Hemlines of the deceased?

229
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,363
I have every right to be here.

230
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:12,363
No, you fuckin' don't.

231
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,238
Lovely. Now I've had gin
for breakfast, too.

232
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:18,113
Inky fingers don't make you
a reporter, Boyle.

233
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:19,446
Inspector Mundi.

234
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,571
Why are those Purists
being detained?

235
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,154
Is there a connection between
them and Miss Brighton's death?

236
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,738
Or was it your detail's
failure to catch Maladie?

237
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,655
Is Mary another
of her messages?

238
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,321
That story's been told.

239
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,905
I don't believe it has.

240
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:34,988
I think there is something
much larger at work
than one maniac.

241
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,571
Have you got information
I can use, Miss...?

242
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,154
Boyle. Effie Boyle
from "The Sentinel,"

243
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:43,071
and, well, nothing yet.

244
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:46,530
But I do know the Touched
are being vilified in the press,

245
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:47,738
often for no reason.

246
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:50,655
It was a Touched that
killed Mary Brighton.

247
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,947
You learn more than that,
come calling.

248
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:59,822
So you just happened by
Mary Brighton's funeral.

249
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:02,154
Nobody told you
about the service.

250
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,488
-We were out walking.

251
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:07,738
You live in the south end,
work at Marster's Mill.

252
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,613
That's four miles
out of your way.

253
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,196
We's peripatetic.

254
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,697
-Look, I told you--
-Tell me.

255
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,655
-We were walking.
-And you stopped
to yell obscenities

256
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,029
at a grieving family.

257
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,530
You're already going to jail.

258
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,947
You can't put us in
for expressing ourselves.

259
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:26,613
No. No, I'm putting you in
for assaulting a police officer.

260
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:32,113
-Well, I like that plan.

261
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,405
Enter the Ape...

262
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:43,196
The Ape?
Wait. The boxer?

263
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,655
The East End Ape?

264
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:47,196
Is that-- Is that Frank Mundi?

265
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,113
-Inspector Mundi.
-Whew. No. You're all right.

266
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,238
Look, a couple of guys
in suits approached us

267
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:54,405
at a Purist meeting, all right?

268
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,905
I don't know the guy
who said go, but...

269
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,655
he gave us this.

270
00:17:58,738 --> 00:18:00,905
Said they were burying
a Touched with decent folk,

271
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:03,613
and we should call 'em out.

272
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:30,071
Great, that's 6:00 in the
main dormitory downstairs.

273
00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:31,738
Thank you.

274
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:33,613
That's another two,
so we can--

275
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,697
Hi. Sorry, are you new
to The Orphanage?

276
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,321
-Okay, do you speak any
languages or dialects?
-Mm-hmm.

277
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:42,530
Yeah? What are they?

278
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:50,446
Cops, the church, the Purists...

279
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,279
and our masked freaks.

280
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:54,988
There's no shortage
of people who hate us.

281
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:57,905
But only a few are powerful
or inventive enough

282
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,863
to have gotten Kroos
out of prison undetected.

283
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:01,613
Maladie?

284
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,488
Kroos was her man.

285
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:04,655
And she's still got a network.

286
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:06,571
They found Horatio
easily enough.

287
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:08,071
Gilbert Massen?

288
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,154
What, Lord Massen?

289
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:12,196
The Great White Hunter.

290
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,113
Oh, he's a piece of work.

291
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,029
I got chums in his factory
talkin' about a strike,

292
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,738
cause he pays a pittance!

293
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,029
And it's dangerous.

294
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:21,822
It's bombs and the like
they're handlin'.

295
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:24,363
But it's a fine fuck-thee-well
if you're injured.

296
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,780
He'd stick your head
on his wall for a trophy

297
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,113
'fore he'd give you thruppence
to feed your kids.

298
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,822
Oh...

299
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,029
I've gone all political. Sorry.

300
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:35,279
-No, it was quite rousing.

301
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:37,071
Horatio, Lucy,
No.

302
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:41,071
-Right. So...

303
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:43,446
-The Beggar King.
A bit public for him.

304
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,822
But he runs Odium,

305
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:48,988
and since we have a hard-won
lead on his address--

306
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,113
I'll take it. I know the area.

307
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,822
If Mrs. True isn't
looking for a rematch.

308
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:58,363
No. I'm going to talk
to Massen. Alone.

309
00:19:58,446 --> 00:19:59,988
You sure that's the way to go?

310
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:02,738
-He's hardly gonna fall into--
-No, I mean, I'm going to.

311
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:04,530
Sometime today.
I've already seen it.

312
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:08,154
Wasn't sure where I was
at first, but... or will be.

313
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,488
Wait, does-- does that
mean Massen killed Mary?

314
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:11,613
Did the ripplings tell you that?

315
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:13,613
They tell me I don't get
to plan my own day.

316
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:15,029
They're not treasure maps.

317
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,655
I'll learn something,
I'm sure, but...

318
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:17,947
And once you have?

319
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:19,655
I mean, if you get something

320
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:21,488
in the way of, uh, "he did it."

321
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,196
Then I will bring that
information back here.

322
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,238
I'm not planning to attack
a Peer of the Realm

323
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:27,488
inside his well-guarded house.

324
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,238
Hmm, sure, but what
you mean to happen

325
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:31,196
and what actually happens
in the thick of it...

326
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,822
It's not just you, True.

327
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:34,655
Everyone has to keep
their heads.

328
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,780
Mary's death needs
to be answered, and
not with another death.

329
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,655
And it's not
just about what's right.

330
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,154
We're hated right now.

331
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:43,029
Our first response
cannot be hate.

332
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,655
We'll be lined up
in the streets.

333
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:47,321
And they may have killed Mary
exactly for that purpose.

334
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:50,238
Make us do something
they can rain hell on us for.

335
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:53,321
See? Annie agrees,
and she's terrible.

336
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:54,571
-And so do I.
-Good.

337
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,530
-Level heads.
-All right. Augustus Bidlow?

338
00:20:57,613 --> 00:20:59,196
Yeah, we should murder him.

339
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,947
I'm with Penance.
That party they thrown,

340
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,488
seeing how he treated her,

341
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:05,905
I nearly pulled off me gloves.

342
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:07,405
Lavinia Bidlow, as well.

343
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:09,029
Or are you just writing down
people you know?

344
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:11,071
Amalia told her
we were going to the park.

345
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:13,655
And she knew
where I'd be coming from.
Still,

346
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:16,071
she might be a bit
over-puckered, but she's
the reason we've got all this.

347
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:19,321
Mm-hmm. The family that
sponsored my medical training--

348
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:22,196
that brought me from
Jamaica to England...

349
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,780
A week in their house,
and I almost swam back.

350
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:28,279
I've been left for dead
by men with less contempt.

351
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,113
Now, Miss Bidlow,
she means well,

352
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:32,488
and I know she does
good work for the Touched,

353
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:34,446
but it doesn't
make her a friend.

354
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,613
So she goes on the list
with her terrible,
bird-watching brother.

355
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,446
He's the ringleader.
You know he--

356
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,530
likes... birds.

357
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:45,113
Birds are stupid.

358
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:47,530
And it's high time
you told him that.

359
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:50,655
What? Go and talk--
No!

360
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,947
-I should do Annie's.
-Track an assassin?

361
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:55,738
Come on, Pen,
you can give Bidlow
the old parasol.

362
00:21:55,822 --> 00:21:57,947
-Lucy, Penance,
No!

363
00:21:58,029 --> 00:21:59,446
-Oh.
-Sorry.

364
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,863
Doctor Cousens,
we got a few peaky ones
down there.

365
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,863
-How are you holding up?
-Oh, well,

366
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,405
my Nigel doesn't really
understand what's going on.

367
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:08,488
But I'm keeping my chins up.

368
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:11,071
Sometimes pretending you
feel good makes you feel better.

369
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:13,113
-Trust me.
All right.

370
00:22:13,196 --> 00:22:15,029
Let's see to those patients.

371
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:17,279
-Don't do anything rash.
-I won't.

372
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:20,405
-I was talking to Penance.

373
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:23,363
Shouldn't you
take Désirée with you

374
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:26,154
-to Massen's?
I should.

375
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:28,571
But I don't.

376
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:51,405
That's a pungent gambit, Tommy.

377
00:22:57,947 --> 00:22:59,947
-Frank.

378
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,238
Frank!

379
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:07,613
You've been mixing
with the Purists.

380
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:08,822
Stirring them up.

381
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:10,321
Did you want to
scare the Touched,

382
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:13,113
so you could tell 'em
they was only safe with you?

383
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:14,697
Uh, first of all, who--

384
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,780
-Who are the fucking Purists?

385
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,071
That's not mine.

386
00:23:28,154 --> 00:23:30,988
You really think
I'd be handing out
personalized evidence?

387
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:32,405
Master Swann.

388
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:34,196
Any assistance required?

389
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:37,196
Uh, no, thank you. Uh...

390
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,196
Just a bit of sport.
We'll keep quiet.

391
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,321
This is a members only
establishment.

392
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:43,947
And you need to fuck off.
Please.

393
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,947
Uh, yes, uh, do fuck off.
There's a lad.

394
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,363
-Look. Think about this.

395
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,196
If they'd said it was
Lord Such-and-What,

396
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,738
you'd be gathering evidence.
Having him followed.

397
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:02,780
Behaving like a detective.

398
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:05,947
Someone pointed you
and pulled your trigger.

399
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,780
It's no secret
that you loathe me.

400
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,446
That don't mean you're innocent.

401
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,154
When--
When have I ever claimed...

402
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:17,780
Wait. Are you talking
about the shooting?

403
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:19,822
I'm not a murderer.

404
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,988
-I had nothing against Mary.
-She was a rival.

405
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,613
I think you know she wasn't.

406
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:30,321
Look, I... I will provide you
with my whereabouts.

407
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:32,488
I wanted to learn
about Amalia True,

408
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,530
and what I've learned
is stay away.

409
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:40,196
-I am not a part of this.
-'Course you are.

410
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,905
And if it ain't you,
it's one of them toffs
you play chess with.

411
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:46,530
Oh, uh, actually we call it
cheese because we--

412
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:49,279
It's rich men grinding up
them who's helpless

413
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,154
for extra penny on the pound,

414
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:54,780
or, or the rights to
a patch of sand. Or a fuck.

415
00:24:56,113 --> 00:24:58,488
-Are we done?
-Oh, we're done, Swann.

416
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:00,154
Across the board.

417
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:02,238
And our little arrangement,

418
00:25:02,321 --> 00:25:04,113
my debt, is done.

419
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,822
Cause I got something
over you now.

420
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,571
I don't fucking care.

421
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,113
Translators.
-Aneel <i>Bring Klaus?</i>

422
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:21,154
Yes, bring Klaus.
Anyone who speaks
another language,

423
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:23,154
or who studied
a dead language really well.

424
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:24,405
I've only got law Latin.

425
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,655
-Oh, it's trouble.

426
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:29,405
Well, you can sneak out
for a kiss anytime,
but not when I need your help?

427
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,905
-Aneel, you know
I wouldn't ask--
<i>-No, of course, I'll do it.</i>

428
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,113
Thank you. I love you.
Yeah. Six o'clock.

429
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:54,279
-Mr. Bidlow.
-Oh.

430
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:56,822
Miss Adair.

431
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,697
Uh, what are you...

432
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,988
Uh, so, does Lavinia
know you're here?

433
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,780
I know very well that
I'm not welcome here.

434
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,154
No, you are. You are.
It's, it's--

435
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:08,530
It's wonderful to--

436
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:10,238
Did, did anybody see you?

437
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:13,029
You seem a bit nervous.

438
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,363
Well, I mean, I usually am,

439
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:19,279
but, but you're well?
No, Lord, no.

440
00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:22,321
No, of course.
I'm so sorry. Um...

441
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:27,446
May I offer my most sincere
condolences about Miss Brighton?

442
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,530
She wouldn't have been
entertaining to your friends,

443
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:33,279
so you needn't grieve overly.

444
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:38,363
Lavinia made me do it.

445
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:42,238
She, she, she said
it would be bad for you.

446
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:44,196
-Bad for me?
-Yes, that's why I did it.

447
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,446
She said if I didn't,
that there would be cons--

448
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:48,530
Wait.

449
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:50,571
Wait, it wa-- It was bad.

450
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:53,363
-So, how is it bad?
-Are you making a joke of this?

451
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,697
You can't, you can't p--
possibly have had any deep,

452
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,530
emotional conn-- connection to--

453
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:01,363
Oh, no, I'm saying,
I'm saying this all wrong.

454
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:03,446
I'm saying it wrong.

455
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,863
I thought it was
the gentlemanly thing to do.

456
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:08,279
Murder?

457
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:10,238
-I'm sorry, what?
-Oh, you are a monster.

458
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,571
And you're gonna go to prison.

459
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:13,113
-I don't care how rich you are.
-What's happening?

460
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:14,697
What's happening?
I don't know what's happening.

461
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,488
You just confessed to
the murder of Mary Brighton,

462
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:19,279
and I made a wax
recording of it.

463
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,196
Ugh.

464
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,113
-Fuckin' prototype.
-Miss Adair.

465
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:33,113
-You are a terrible person!
-Yes, I know. I know!

466
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:35,613
But I-- I didn't kill Miss--
Can I--

467
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,405
Uh, I'm fine.

468
00:27:39,697 --> 00:27:41,613
I was referring to the party.

469
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:45,530
It's my... awful...

470
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:47,655
I was just abominably rude.

471
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:50,321
And I've barely slept since.

472
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:53,321
When I heard what happened,
I wanted to reach out to you
in your grief,

473
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,321
and it just-- it seemed--
it seemed opportunistic, or--

474
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:59,738
You, you didn't kill Mary?

475
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:04,279
Is-- is that bad? Um, it's...

476
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:06,988
Of course you didn't.

477
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:09,530
You're as gentle as a blush.

478
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:11,780
But you're still terrible.

479
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,530
Yeah.

480
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:18,988
Tell me just anything that
I can do to make amends.

481
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:21,196
I cried,

482
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,238
which seems petty now
to think about, but...

483
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:29,196
I don't-- I don't have
a lot of experience with men.

484
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,238
Certainly not of your class,
which from what I've seen...

485
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:35,988
No, nobody is quite
as barbaric as the well-to-do.

486
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:41,071
Your Lucy had me figured out.

487
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,071
Miss Adair,
I would give anything

488
00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:46,822
if you would erase
that day from your mind.

489
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:49,446
That's not how it works.

490
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:51,405
No.

491
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,405
No.

492
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:57,488
Nor should it be.

493
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,238
Remember my transgressions,

494
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,613
so that I may re-earn your trust
honestly, over time.

495
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:07,321
If we are...

496
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:11,196
If we are to be acquainted,

497
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,780
I shall endeavor--

498
00:29:12,863 --> 00:29:16,405
No, no, no, no!
Damn acquaintance.

499
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,405
Acquaintance is exhausting.
I just--

500
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:20,863
I want to be your friend,
Miss Adair.

501
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:28,780
I want--
I want to become your friend.

502
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:33,905
You sent the flowers for Mary.

503
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:37,613
-Was the wreath too much?
It was, it was garish.
-No.

504
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:47,196
Do you think your sister
did the murder then?

505
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:48,905
What?

506
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,154
I was only askin'.

507
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:05,697
Maybe it's your tone of voice.

508
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:13,196
-How'd you get there?
-I'm Nimble.

509
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,154
No, I'm Nimble,

510
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:19,113
as in, "How do you do?
Nimble Jack.

511
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:20,947
-But my friends all call me--"
-You didn't answer my question.

512
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:24,488
Well, I'm wondering what
a sweet thing like you
is doing 'round here.

513
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:26,571
I'm from around here.

514
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:30,071
-They don't seem
to remember you.
-No, they did.

515
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,780
-What do you want?
-A drink, maybe.

516
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:38,321
Light supper?
Three Vicars does
a nice eel pie.

517
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:40,697
-Private room.

518
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:47,446
Too fast?

519
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,530
-You work for the Beggar King.
With.

520
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:52,738
On occasion.

521
00:30:52,822 --> 00:30:54,863
One of his gang
plays the fiddle.

522
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:57,405
Gave up an address
to a belligerent widow.

523
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,321
Fiddler said he tried
to fight, but...

524
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:02,613
she got him pinned,
and squeezed it out of him.

525
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:05,822
Poor Declan. He really
can't find decent help.

526
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,571
-Which is why he'd prefer
you don't kill Odium.
Yeah.

527
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:11,405
This wasn't the King's work.
Come on.

528
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:13,530
Maladie's man shoots
the Brighton girl.

529
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:16,405
Beggar King's chief enforcer
goes after the widow.

530
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:18,405
Someone's puttin' on a show.

531
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,488
I need more than "someone."

532
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:22,321
Odium knows fuck all.

533
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:25,988
He's dim, bless him,
and he's in for another
thrashing.

534
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:29,738
But he's necessary
to keep the peace.

535
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,905
Keep appearances.

536
00:31:31,988 --> 00:31:33,947
Leave Odium be,

537
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:37,613
and the opium you torched
is bygones.

538
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:39,113
Friends.

539
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:42,697
Or... common enemy.

540
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,071
Where is she?
-This lot,
he doesn't care about.

541
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,446
-Seems like they all
remember you.
-Just keep your head down.

542
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,154
Never have, never will.

543
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,988
Thank you for seeing me.

544
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:35,488
The Bidlows are old friends.

545
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:37,905
Lavinia and I may not
see eye-to-eye on everything,

546
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:40,863
but she doesn't waste her time
with trifling people.

547
00:32:40,947 --> 00:32:42,780
I think she regards you
quite highly.

548
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:45,363
I owe her a great deal.
Everyone at The Orphanage does.

549
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:48,738
Forgive me.
I did read about your girl,
Miss Brighton.

550
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:51,196
I suspect you've had
all the condolences
you have room for,

551
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,697
so may I offer you a sherry?

552
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,154
Bit early, but...

553
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,780
And may I also offer

554
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:02,279
a conjecture?

555
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:05,863
You think that I had something
to do with your friend's death.

556
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:08,738
Did you? It would save me
such a lot of time.

557
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:12,196
I'm going to have to
disappoint you, I'm afraid.

558
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,113
No one at the club is vying
for credit either,

559
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:16,655
though I will keep an ear out.

560
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:18,113
Appreciated.

561
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,822
But, what I could really use
is your perspective,

562
00:33:21,905 --> 00:33:25,071
as a military man and a powerful
member of the established order.

563
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:28,196
Whoever did have
Mary Brighton killed was
making a public statement.

564
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,780
Like stepping on stage
and murdering six people.

565
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:32,863
-A different message.
-The same messenger.

566
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:34,446
That gunman, Kroos.

567
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,154
-Well, he's taken care of.
-Shame.

568
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:38,488
He might have talked.

569
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:40,988
You killed her.
Let's say.

570
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:42,488
If you'll indulge me,

571
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:44,029
I've found this
a useful exercise.

572
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:47,321
Let's assume it wasn't Maladie
or an erstwhile lover,

573
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:49,655
but someone with
a broader view.

574
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,279
You'll take the part of the
mastermind behind Mary's death.

575
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,446
And you'll be
the irate inspector?

576
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,238
I'll be Mary.

577
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,530
Why would you want me dead?

578
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:01,446
I doubt that I do.

579
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:07,530
I'm not entirely clear
what your "turn" is.

580
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,863
A beacon of some sort?

581
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:13,530
Anyway benign,
and you're an
inoffensive woman.

582
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,947
No history of radicalism,
I assume.

583
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:17,363
So why me?

584
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,279
Why not kill that widow,
Mrs. True?

585
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:20,863
She's a willful creature,

586
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:22,571
and the leader
of this motley coven.

587
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:24,321
Which means
she must have enemies.

588
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:27,780
Her death might be tragic,
but perhaps not unexpected.

589
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:30,488
You, on the other hand,
are a pure

590
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:31,947
and blameless woman.

591
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,279
And all in white, no less.

592
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,238
A statuesque beauty
with a mass of auburn hair

593
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:39,571
and great shining eyes...

594
00:34:39,655 --> 00:34:41,238
Christ, I'm not just a beacon.

595
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:43,697
I genuinely resemble
a lighthouse.

596
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:49,154
It isn't just a warning.

597
00:34:49,238 --> 00:34:50,905
It's about hope.

598
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,697
It's about pulling
the heart out of the orphans.

599
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:57,238
I would think so.

600
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,405
In fact, I would say,

601
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:01,154
Miss Brighton,

602
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:04,154
that you are a casualty of war.

603
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:07,613
So we're at war.

604
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,905
A few years back,

605
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,822
a pestilence ran
through this city.

606
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:15,863
Some anarchic cabal

607
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,613
found or developed
a power that mocks God.

608
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:23,071
That molests and disfigures
His natural law.

609
00:35:24,738 --> 00:35:27,613
It was an attack on
the stability, the harmony,

610
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,363
if you will, of the empire.

611
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:33,780
And we must show the victims
of this deliberate plague

612
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:36,113
that they are not special.
They are not a community.

613
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:39,863
Victims is all they have
license to be.

614
00:35:39,947 --> 00:35:43,613
If I am your killer revealed,

615
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:46,321
behold the lion,

616
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,071
Great Britain.

617
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:49,863
An empire unparalleled

618
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,029
and unmerciful in
its self-preservation.

619
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,196
My enemy is England.

620
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:01,029
-Well, that narrows it down.
Thank God I came.
-I said your killer.

621
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:03,446
Your enemy, Miss Brighton,

622
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,655
is the scum
who caused this plague,

623
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:08,530
the fools who call it power,

624
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,738
and the woman
who should have known

625
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:14,071
what would happen
to you in that park.

626
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:17,363
Unless, of course,

627
00:36:17,446 --> 00:36:19,405
she did.

628
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:23,780
So, he confessed
without confessing.

629
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:25,321
It was honestly impressive.

630
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:27,655
I should have worn
your recording frame.

631
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:29,446
But he didn't give up
his source.

632
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,154
He never flat-out said.

633
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:33,321
Even if we had proof,
Massen knows we couldn't
touch him.

634
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:36,446
-I could touch him.
-Oh, please tell me we're not
havin' this talk again.

635
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,196
No. Even if he gave the order,

636
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,113
he's part of something
much bigger.

637
00:36:41,196 --> 00:36:44,863
Pull out one piece,
it would be replaced in a day.

638
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:46,822
And damn it, it's wrong.

639
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,863
He's a human being
who's alive, damn it.

640
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:51,822
We still need a response.

641
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:54,446
If we let murder slide,
it will only slide down.

642
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,863
Whatever's next will be worse.

643
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:59,613
Even I know that's true.

644
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:02,029
Well, some of the lads say
he has a warehouse

645
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:03,655
full of munitions
we could torch.

646
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:07,863
-Hmm.
-I don't think there's
anyone in there at night.

647
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:12,488
He deserves much worse,
but it would be a start.

648
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,488
All in favor?

649
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,196
You fuckin' idiot.

650
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,196
You might as well
have marched in
the House of Lords

651
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,321
and had a slash!

652
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,196
Superintendent's had an earful.

653
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,530
I was pursuing a lead.

654
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:25,321
Unless Maladie was havin'
tea in that club,

655
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:26,738
Superintendent don't want to hear it.

656
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:29,738
Mundi! Get in here!

657
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,655
It'll be fine.

658
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:36,154
-Can I have your desk?
-You can cop a mouse.

659
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:45,446
Shh... shh...

660
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,738
-Let him go.
-But he lies about me.

661
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:50,071
He'll stop.

662
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:52,571
And, and he'll resign,
and, and he'll never

663
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:55,863
-bother you again--
-Oh, now you're lying!
I heard you wouldn't.

664
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:58,113
And, whoa, the papers!

665
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:01,154
They say I killed Mary.
They call me crazy.

666
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,113
I never did it.

667
00:38:03,196 --> 00:38:05,822
I only kill angels.
Mostly.

668
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:08,697
I liked Mary so much.

669
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,530
She was gonna be my pet,
and sleep on my belly.

670
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:14,363
-You were gonna hang her.
-Well, we had a lot of plans.

671
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:19,321
She talked about the detective
who was smart, and honest.

672
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:22,196
And she didn't marry him
because he was sad.

673
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,988
For Mary's sake, will you--

674
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:26,780
-Will you let him live?
-Oh, she doesn't have
a sake, love.

675
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:29,988
She's dead.
She's all cold in that box.

676
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:33,071
Everyone crying as they
lowered it in the hole,

677
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:35,613
singin' about the workday,
and what.

678
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:38,113
Y-- You were there?

679
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:41,571
Of course.

680
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:44,321
I was in the box.

681
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,279
I had a little cuddle.

682
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:47,947
But she smelled different.

683
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,988
And I will not believe
that was her favorite dress.

684
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:53,488
What do you want?

685
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,905
I want everyone to stop lying.

686
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:57,822
Can you see to that?

687
00:38:57,905 --> 00:39:00,154
I will try.

688
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:03,613
I have to think about
my reputation.

689
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:08,738
Things never come back
when they go away.

690
00:39:08,822 --> 00:39:11,405
-Ha!
In here! Now!

691
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:14,988
Oh, Christ.

692
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:17,988
Oh, no!

693
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:19,988
That's a form of lying!

694
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,321
No!

695
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:02,279
Mundi.

696
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:05,697
Fuck, it's her! It's Maladie!

697
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,154
He fucking got her!

698
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,571
Right. Not so scary now--

699
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:12,279
All right.

700
00:40:12,363 --> 00:40:14,321
-Hey.

701
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:16,655
Justice.

702
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:19,988
She gets justice from us.

703
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:23,196
I'll have badge and balls
off any man who tries that.

704
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:26,988
She gets justice from us.

705
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:32,321
Okay, everybody.

706
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:33,905
Ready?

707
00:40:33,988 --> 00:40:35,363
Okay.

708
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:38,071
Right. Myrtle?

709
00:40:38,154 --> 00:40:40,530
-Nice and loud.

710
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,196
Myrtle.

711
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:46,738
A little slower.

712
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:48,613
Uh...

713
00:41:11,363 --> 00:41:12,738
Again?

714
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:14,822
Um, uh...

715
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:24,947
I know it!

716
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:27,613
The darkness.

717
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:30,363
Dark. Um, uh, before the dark?

718
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,697
Uh, come before the dark.

719
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,321
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

720
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:35,655
Was that near the end?

721
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:38,655
-Again.

722
00:42:05,988 --> 00:42:08,321
My mate said the warehouse--
Yeah.

723
00:42:08,405 --> 00:42:09,780
It's that one.

724
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,780
And the entrance
is on the far side.

725
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,863
And that lot?

726
00:42:14,947 --> 00:42:16,530
I promised Penance.

727
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:19,196
-Because it's your turn again!
-No, it ain't my turn
to get the cup.

728
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:21,363
-I always got to get the cup.
-Just do what you're told,
all right?

729
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:23,446
-If the foreman finds out
we've left...

730
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,363
-Do you hear that?

731
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:30,613
Bloody hell.
What the blazes is that?

732
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,363
Do you ever think maybe
Penance is frightening?

733
00:42:43,446 --> 00:42:47,571
And what were you gonna do?
Hand 'em a daisy?

734
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:50,530
-Stay outside.
-I'm the one with the fire.

735
00:42:50,613 --> 00:42:53,530
And we need to make sure
no one goes up in it.

736
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,446
Your funeral.

737
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:34,905
-No one.
-Looks good.

738
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,613
Due to ship out at dawn.

739
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:39,905
I'd like to see his face.

740
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:42,113
Let's open a couple.
Make sure we have
the right shipment.

741
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:44,655
You sure the guards
are still sleepin'?

742
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:46,071
We have time.

743
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:50,154
Yeah. No, I just have
that-- that feeling.

744
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:53,488
Lucy.

745
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:56,238
Open the crate.

746
00:44:02,196 --> 00:44:05,154
Well, now we know why
the war isn't going better.

747
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:09,863
They swore
they were weapons, True.

748
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,530
They must be workin' for...

749
00:44:21,988 --> 00:44:24,697
-How'd you cop it?
-It was the rippling.

750
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,530
Your talk of Massen's hunting.
His trophies.

751
00:44:27,613 --> 00:44:30,321
You'd have to have been
in his study to call that up.

752
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:32,446
I might have missed it
if I hadn't seen it twice.

753
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:36,488
-My clapper of a mouth.
-And then this perfectly
convenient plan.

754
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,697
Warehouse of munitions
no one's really guarding?

755
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,530
Christ,
it was all already there.

756
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:44,113
The questions, the absences,

757
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:46,530
the money you swore
you didn't steal so
we'd assume you did.

758
00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:48,405
-I figured that'd
get a bit tired.
-You clean my study,

759
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:50,822
but you can't make
your own bed.
I am such an idiot.

760
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:53,738
I didn't know what they
was plannin' for Mary.

761
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:56,154
-I swear.
-What else would
they have ever done,

762
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:57,947
after you told them
Mary was a beacon?

763
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:02,113
-What do you want, True?
-I want it to be someone else!

764
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:04,905
I want it to be Harriet,
or Jo.

765
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:07,905
Or the one who does,
she... Helen.

766
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:10,780
-Maud.
-The one who does
the cartwheels. Fuck!

767
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:13,530
You were the first woman,
the first woman

768
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:15,863
to walk through those doors!

769
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:18,488
The one I could lean on
instead of protecting,

770
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:19,905
that understood the world

771
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:23,488
-the way that I do.
-You don't know fuck
about the world.

772
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:25,780
All your war stories.

773
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:30,780
You don't know which war.
Oh, oh, it's awful.

774
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:33,405
'Cause you've left bodies
on the field,

775
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:35,446
and you're all damaged.

776
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:39,613
I broke my son to pieces.

777
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:44,988
I held my baby,
and it killed him.

778
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:48,154
And it wasn't sudden
like I said.

779
00:45:48,238 --> 00:45:52,238
The breaks, they were sudden.

780
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:56,321
But he... he held on.

781
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,363
And he screamed.

782
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:03,905
He screamed longer than I did
pushin' him out...

783
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:05,947
'fore his heart gave.

784
00:46:07,154 --> 00:46:11,530
So you tell me, are we sisters?

785
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:15,655
It's been three years since
I've touched another person.

786
00:46:15,738 --> 00:46:18,822
And Massen,
he says he'll find a cure.

787
00:46:18,905 --> 00:46:20,405
Of course he tells you that.

788
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:23,697
And what are you telling us?

789
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,279
A better world?

790
00:46:26,363 --> 00:46:29,613
How many of your precious
orphans would be lining up

791
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:31,488
to be free of your better world

792
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:33,238
if they had half a chance?

793
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:35,655
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

794
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:37,071
I don't know what happened.

795
00:46:37,154 --> 00:46:39,697
How do you know
how it's supposed to be?

796
00:46:41,488 --> 00:46:43,488
Did you do this?

797
00:46:44,738 --> 00:46:47,697
Did you make this nightmare?

798
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,029
I just got left behind.

799
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:55,279
'Course you got left behind.
What good are you?

800
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:57,113
You, a leader?

801
00:46:57,196 --> 00:46:59,071
You're out whoring
when your girls need--

802
00:46:59,154 --> 00:47:03,363
Your boss told me today
that we're at war.

803
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,780
I didn't start it.

804
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,655
I didn't even volunteer.
But he's right.

805
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:10,988
I hope he told you what happens
to spies during wartime.

806
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:13,029
Is that what this is?

807
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:17,780
There's rules of engagement.

808
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:21,363
And not just you
needing to take your
failure out on someone.

809
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:27,405
You think Penance will
forgive you for this?

810
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:30,029
You think Mary would?

811
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,405
-And that's where you lose me.

812
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:59,905
You're finished in London.
Forever.

813
00:48:59,988 --> 00:49:02,697
Annie and I will put you
on a boat and you'll stay on it

814
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,446
until you're well
and fucking gone.

815
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:06,530
And you'll tell me
everything you know.

816
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:08,988
Everything. Yes?

817
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:14,905
Where are the real munitions?

818
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,488
A fire? Oh, no!

819
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:24,905
-Foreman
<i>It's everywhere.</i>
-How?

820
00:49:24,988 --> 00:49:26,947
<i>My men were just
doing the rounds.</i>

821
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:29,071
<i>Everything exploded,
and it was, it was chaos!</i>

822
00:49:29,154 --> 00:49:32,071
Was anyone
at the factory harmed?

823
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:36,488
No, it was the factory, the--

824
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:38,613
Foreman
<i>Luckily no one was hurt.</i>

825
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:46,863
The Paul Street
storage building.

826
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:51,029
I see.

827
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:05,905
This wasn't the plan.

828
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,446
Well, it was your plan,
wasn't it?

829
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:17,196
I'm just your instrument.

830
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,196
I've always been
your instrument.

831
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:28,071
Why won't you play me?

832
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:32,238
Why?

833
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,238
I still can't make sense of it.

834
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:40,446
-Lucy.
-We should have seen it
a long time ago.

835
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:43,363
I just hope she's the only one.

836
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:46,238
Losing her the same day
we buried M--

837
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:50,863
Anyway, I'm grateful
you spared her life.

838
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,780
I didn't.

839
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:55,738
You did.

840
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,530
That idiotic pin.

841
00:50:58,613 --> 00:51:00,863
She could have gotten away,
but she wouldn't leave
without it.

842
00:51:00,947 --> 00:51:03,446
That was always my plan,
of course.

843
00:51:05,697 --> 00:51:09,405
She said I had no idea what
anyone is going through here.

844
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,571
I hate that she's right.

845
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:17,154
But I can't...
get close to them.

846
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:19,446
Lucy's proof of that.

847
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:22,446
She shows her face
in London again though,

848
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,321
it'll take more than a piece
of jewelry to save her.

849
00:51:26,863 --> 00:51:30,571
So, um,
a bigger piece of jewelry?

850
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:32,405
A belt, maybe, or a hat?

851
00:51:32,488 --> 00:51:35,613
True, I can't make her
a whole outfit.

852
00:51:35,697 --> 00:51:39,405
You are the strangest
person I've ever met.

853
00:51:39,488 --> 00:51:41,655
It's why you're the one I trust.

854
00:51:44,363 --> 00:51:46,571
Augie Bidlow's Touched.

855
00:51:46,655 --> 00:51:49,947
Birds. He sort of controls them.

856
00:51:50,029 --> 00:51:52,238
I'll be damned.

857
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:54,571
Do you think that's why
Lavinia took up the cause?

858
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:56,405
He's certain she doesn't know.

859
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,446
I think he's afraid to tell her.

860
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,530
But he's not afraid to tell you.

861
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:04,113
-You're here!

862
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:06,488
-They're here!
-We are here.

863
00:52:06,571 --> 00:52:09,488
-You won't believe it.
-Myrtle, what's wrong?

864
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:11,113
No, it's not wrong at all.

865
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:14,113
Harriet, tell them.
It was mostly Harriet
that worked it out.

866
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:15,822
I helped with the French,
though.

867
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:17,446
Harriet, please.

868
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,279
I'm sorry, it...
I don't want to say it wrong.

869
00:52:20,363 --> 00:52:22,363
And it, it wasn't me.
It was Myrtle.

870
00:52:27,154 --> 00:52:30,279
Myrtle understood Mary's song.
Mostly.

871
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:32,446
Even Mary didn't know
what her songs meant...

872
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,697
She always said.

873
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,113
Some of it was more
about emotion than...

874
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:37,988
Or emotion plus semantics,

875
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,780
but she remembered a lot.
She just didn't know
how to tell us.

876
00:52:40,863 --> 00:52:42,405
Myrtle.

877
00:52:44,863 --> 00:52:48,446
-What did she say?
-Uh, she said,
"You're not alone."

878
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:52,405
-Well, I think we could
all feel that--
-You, Mrs. True.

879
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:55,738
She said it to you.

880
00:52:55,822 --> 00:53:00,321
She said,
"Amalia, my lonely soldier."

881
00:53:00,405 --> 00:53:03,988
Um, something about
wearing stripes.

882
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:05,655
But that part...

883
00:53:05,738 --> 00:53:09,029
But she said,
"I didn't leave you.

884
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:11,988
"I went into,
in-inside the city.

885
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:15,113
I was damaged..."
uh, "incomplete?

886
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:16,571
"I had to heal.

887
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:19,988
-Soon we will all be ready..."
-Oh, that part was me.

888
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:23,655
"But it's dark.
There's a darkness."

889
00:53:24,822 --> 00:53:28,113
She said to-to everyone,
all of us,

890
00:53:28,196 --> 00:53:30,238
to gather,

891
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:33,446
-and protect each other.

892
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,196
Because of the dark.

893
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:45,822
And was there more?

894
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:50,446
Uh, "Find me.

895
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,571
"Let them help, those who will,

896
00:53:52,655 --> 00:53:54,947
but come below and find me."

897
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:58,697
Um...

898
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,655
"Come before the dark,
and we can save..."

899
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:06,446
It ended there. That's when...

900
00:54:14,238 --> 00:54:16,655
Those aren't Mary's words,
are they?

901
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,321
That was someone else
talking through her.

902
00:54:21,488 --> 00:54:22,988
That's right.

903
00:54:24,446 --> 00:54:25,988
Then who?

904
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:29,321
Who do we need to find?
