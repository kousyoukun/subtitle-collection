1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,360
- I - want you to join us.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,531
Is that the
mission you were going on about?

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,834
You still feel it. Mary's song.

4
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,097
You know what a
better world could be like.

5
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,476
First time Mary sang,

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,750
only the Touched that were
in the room could hear it.

7
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,750
We'll make Mary's
voice loud enough

8
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:21,333
that it could be heard by
Touched across the city.

9
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:23,518
We need
to get those fliers taken down.

10
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:24,750
They could be all over London.

11
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,351
What did they do to the girls?

12
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,375
Experiments.

13
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,643
We need to know
everything they've been doing.

14
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:30,667
Oh! Who are you?

15
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,667
The Order is to eliminate Maladie.

16
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,375
Maladie has done us a favor.

17
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,291
She turned sentiment
against the Touched.

18
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,125
We're being attacked,
locked up, and thrown in the street.

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,500
We have enemies you
don't know about yet.

20
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,792
The Touched,
they'll all come to us.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,333
They'll be safe.

- Witches! - Freaks!

41
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:04,583
- Why don't we drown you all? Ha, ha!
- Good riddance!

42
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,875
Drown her! Let's
see if she floats!

43
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,041
- Vile creatures!
- Go on, piss off!

44
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,250
Please, Inspector. Not now.

45
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,250
Not here.

46
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,643
- You're under arrest.
- Come on, you two.

47
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:15,583
There we go...

48
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,417
I know your loss is
greater than any of us

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,834
- can even...
- Where the fuck is she?

50
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:24,458
Where's the lady who
can see the future?

51
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,291
A kiss for a pint.
That was the deal.

52
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,208
I am a woman of my word.

53
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,041
Kiss for a pint.

54
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,583
Oh, no, you fucking don't...

55
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,709
I'm gonna need you in a minute.

56
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,834
Who speaks for these men?

57
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,542
Him, m'lord.

58
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,083
Jacobs.

59
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,166
The men learnt there are
explosives among the cargo here.

60
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,959
They feel they're due higher
wages for handling them.

61
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,000
Who here knows what this is?

62
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,875
Well, that's a shell, sir.

63
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,750
Loaded with cordite.
Ready for the war.

64
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,083
Top marks.

65
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,417
It's good for blowing
up the enemy,

66
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,125
and for saving our lads.

67
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,542
That's who you're holding
hostage here. Your brothers.

68
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,041
That doesn't change the facts...

69
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,083
Jesus!

70
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,250
If they were unstable,

71
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,083
we would simply roll
them over the line,

72
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,875
wouldn't we?

73
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,834
You men are seeking a grievance.

74
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:16,125
The docks are full of men
who care about our troops,

75
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,875
and foreigners who
care about nothing.

76
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,542
I can fill your jobs in an hour!

77
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,625
Get back to work,
and I will forget this happened.

78
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,333
No repercussions.

79
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,041
You won't be docked
for this stoppage.

80
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,583
It's very generous.

81
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,959
Go on. Go on. Back to work.

82
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,875
Go on. Go on.

83
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,709
Next time,
come and talk to me as individuals.

84
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,125
To band together when
you could stand alone?

85
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,875
I expect more courage
from Englishmen.

86
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,834
They're taking the carrot,
my lord.

87
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,875
They're mouthing the carrot.

88
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,750
They spit it back out,
we'll use the stick.

89
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,250
I thought Aneel was with you.

90
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,333
He had to get back to school.

91
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,959
I mean, he gets to.

92
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,500
If you're up to it,
I need a favor.

93
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,166
- - The new folk,

94
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,500
there's rumors one or two
have outstanding warrants.

95
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,500
Petty charges, likely cooked up.

96
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,834
Oh. It should mostly just be fines,
I imagine.

97
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:44,959
Some of them might
not technically be citizens.

98
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,959
They don't all speak English,
so it's hard to tell.

99
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,875
I don't know if that matters,
but I'll find out.

100
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,417
- You're a daisy.
- I'd rather be a barrister.

101
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,917
Then I could
prosecute the men...

102
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,875
I don't see how, though.

103
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,583
I can't even apply
to Aneel's school.

104
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,458
How are we ever
gonna see justice

105
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,625
if we're not a part of justice?

106
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,875
All I can see my way
through is a grape.

107
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,792
You know you're gonna have
to clean up those shards, right?

108
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,500
Yeah.

109
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,041
So, is this what we can expect?

110
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,417
A leader who doesn't lead?

111
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,250
Are you looking
to fill that position?

112
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,750
She does have the nicest room.

113
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,000
You know True
should have been there.

114
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,267
I've shown more respect for Mary,
and I'm her kidnapper.

115
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:51,083
Amalia misses the point of things,
as often as not.

116
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,000
But if that chair is
warm when she sits in it,

117
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,291
she'll know why.

118
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,250
You don't think I can best her?

119
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,208
I don't think you want her job.

120
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,542
It's very draining.

121
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,208
Did you see anyone out
of place at the funeral?

122
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,208
Not Maladie. None of the gang.

123
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,208
Beggar King sent a wreath.

124
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,166
- The great big one?
- She lost a friend.

125
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,625
She didn't win the Derby.

126
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,709
Big one wasn't signed.

127
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,875
Couple of Purists making a fuss.

128
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,333
You probably saw.

129
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:20,542
The pink rags.

130
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,542
- Purists all have them.
- So they have a name now?

131
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,917
- Christ preserve us.
- Thought that was my job.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,709
- We don't want more violence.
- This is London, Doctor.

133
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,792
There's always more.

134
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,583
I still don't see how you can
go from working for Maladie...

135
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,166
to being here with Amalia.

136
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,959
You really think
they're that different?

137
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,083
True still not back?

138
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,500
I swear to Jesus, I would...

139
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,417
Have you not finished
discussing my faults?

140
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Come on, Penance. Jesus awaits.

141
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,166
He already knows
what I was gonna say,

142
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,291
and I'll add a few Hail
Marys for that later.

143
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,834
Frank Mundi'll owe a few himself,
poor man.

144
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,583
Maladie didn't
show at the funeral.

145
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,375
Can you believe the
rudeness of that woman?

146
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,041
It'd be madness to show,
and not her kind.

147
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,125
The papers that bothered to report
on the shootin' are all blamin' her,

148
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,643
and we don't know
that we shouldn't be.

149
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,041
I still thought she might go.

150
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,000
So why didn't you?

151
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,875
The man who tried to
drown me is Nicholas Perbal.

152
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,166
Ach. That brute?

153
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,917
The blasphemy
of walking on water

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,166
for the purpose of murder...

155
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,333
He's called Odium.

156
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,709
Not by his dear Granny Perbal,

157
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,458
who owns a snug little attic
somewhere in the narrows.

158
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:28,625
Beggar King's man says he's convalescing,
likely at Gran's.

159
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,166
Do violins cost a lot?

160
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,250
The two attacks could be unrelated,
you and Mary.

161
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,875
- Lot of people don't like you, I'm told.
- I know.

162
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,500
...a casualty of war...

163
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,125
I need a bath.

164
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,875
Tell Lucy we're
meeting in an hour.

165
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,417
Start listing suspects.

166
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,291
But she's broken up
worst of all the girls.

167
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,000
We'll take her mind off it.

168
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,000
It's all hands on deck,
and she has the best hands in the group.

169
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,792
In the meantime...

170
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,500
Make yourself comfortable.

171
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,518
Ah, True,
sure and you should've been at the service.

172
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,291
You're a bitter poor
example to the girls.

173
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,333
But I'm so tough
and mean, and I hate sentiment.

174
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,041
And also people. And myself.

175
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,309
Ah, Lord,
Mary Brighton trusted you,

176
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,250
- and you failed her.
- Is that what you think?

177
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,476
I think the
longer we wait to find the killer,

178
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,250
the greater the
chance we never do.

179
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,583
Mary doesn't need me
crying over her corpse.

180
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,667
True, I can't imagine how many
funerals you've been to, but...

181
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,083
None. We don't do
that when I'm from.

182
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,309
We don't have enough time
and we don't have enough ground.

183
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,333
You know better than
anyone what pain does

184
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,685
when you don't make time for it.

185
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,959
All time does is run out.

186
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,291
I was left here,
completely alone,

187
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,625
with nothing but a mission
I was never actually given.

188
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,083
No orders, no objectives...

189
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,750
They left me here and
they fucked right off.

190
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,125
Maybe they died.
Who cares? I'm here...

191
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,083
where a woman can be
killed just for having a voice,

192
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,766
which will be the
world's fucking epitaph

193
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,375
if I can't do something
other than make it worse.

194
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,138
I know your burdens,
True. But is vengeance

195
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,417
going to make the world better?

196
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,667
If we... if we find out
who took away our Mary,

197
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,630
I have a worry as to
your next course of action,

198
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,125
because the rest of us,
we had a chance to say goodbye...

199
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,709
To remember the
goodness of her heart,

200
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,959
and not just the unfairness
of her being taken.

201
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,458
You keep saying taken instead
of murdered. Mary was murdered.

202
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,000
- I was there, True.
- So was the man with the gun.

203
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,667
He was set up
before we got there.

204
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,291
So stop worrying about
who wasn't at the funeral,

205
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,834
and start asking who
wasn't at that park.

206
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,667
You don't mean one of us.

207
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,834
Well, I know it wasn't me.

208
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,583
Myrtle?

209
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,625
Do you want to talk?

210
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,250
May I see?

211
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,625
Oh, Myrtle.

212
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,458
This is so...

213
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,667
You... heard her?

214
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,375
You wish you could hear her.

215
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,667
You want to learn to read?

216
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,917
Mary sang to you.

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,500
To... I'm trying.

218
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,959
Mary sang to you.

219
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,417
To this person.

220
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,750
About this person?

221
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,166
When Mary sang, you heard...

222
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,959
Words.

223
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,875
Language.

224
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,709
Mary was telling us something,
and you understood it.

225
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,709
Was it something nice?

226
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,125
So now you're after
our jobs as well?

227
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,834
What angle are you pursuing?

228
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,000
Hemlines of the deceased?

229
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,375
I have every right to be here.

230
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,375
No, you fuckin' don't.

231
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,250
Lovely. Now I've had gin for breakfast,
too.

232
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,125
Inky fingers don't make you a reporter,
Boyle.

233
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,458
Inspector Mundi.

234
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,583
Why are those
Purists being detained?

235
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,166
Is there a connection between
them and Miss Brighton's death?

236
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,750
Or was it your detail's
failure to catch Maladie?

237
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,667
Is Mary another of her messages?

238
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,333
That story's been told.

239
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,917
I don't believe it has.

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think there is something much
larger at work than one maniac.

241
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,583
Have you got information I can use,
Miss...?

242
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,166
Boyle. Effie Boyle
from "The Sentinel,"

243
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,083
and, well, nothing yet.

244
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,542
But I do know the Touched
are being vilified in the press,

245
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,750
often for no reason.

246
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,667
It was a Touched that
killed Mary Brighton.

247
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,959
You learn more than that,
come calling.

248
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,834
So you just happened
by Mary Brighton's funeral.

249
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:57,166
Nobody told you
about the service.

250
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,500
We were out walking.

251
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,750
You live in the south end,
work at Marster's Mill.

252
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,625
That's four miles
out of your way.

253
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,208
We's peripatetic.

254
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,709
- Look, I told you... - Tell me.

255
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,667
- We were walking.
- And you stopped to yell obscenities

256
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,041
at a grieving family.

257
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,542
You're already going to jail.

258
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,959
You can't put us
in for expressing ourselves.

259
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,625
No. No, I'm putting you in
for assaulting a police officer.

260
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,125
- - Well, I like that plan.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,417
Enter the Ape...

262
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,208
The Ape? Wait. The boxer?

263
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,667
The East End Ape?

264
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,208
Is that... Is that Frank Mundi?

265
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,125
- Inspector Mundi.
- Whew. No. You're all right.

266
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,309
Look,
a couple of guys in suits approached us

267
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,476
at a Purist meeting, all right?

268
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,917
I don't know the guy who said go,
but...

269
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,667
he gave us this.

270
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,917
Said they were burying a
Touched with decent folk,

271
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,625
and we should call 'em out.

272
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,083
Great, that's 6:00 in
the main dormitory downstairs.

273
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,750
Thank you.

274
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,625
That's another two, so we can...

275
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,709
Hi. Sorry,
are you new to The Orphanage?

276
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:35,333
- Okay, do you speak any languages or dialects?
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,542
Yeah? What are they?

278
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,458
Cops, the church, the Purists...

279
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,291
and our masked freaks.

280
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,000
There's no shortage
of people who hate us.

281
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,917
But only a few are
powerful or inventive enough

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,875
to have gotten Kroos
out of prison undetected.

283
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,625
Maladie?

284
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,500
Kroos was her man.

285
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,726
And she's still got a network.

286
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,583
They found Horatio
easily enough.

287
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,083
Gilbert Massen?

288
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,166
What, Lord Massen?

289
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,208
The Great White Hunter.

290
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,125
Oh, he's a piece of work.

291
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,041
I got chums in his factory
talkin' about a strike,

292
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,750
cause he pays a pittance!

293
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,041
And it's dangerous.

294
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,834
It's bombs and the
like they're handlin'.

295
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,375
But it's a fine fuck-thee-well
if you're injured.

296
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,851
He'd stick your head
on his wall for a trophy

297
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,125
'fore he'd give you
thruppence to feed your kids.

298
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,834
Oh...

299
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,041
I've gone all political. Sorry.

300
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,291
No, it was quite rousing.

301
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,083
Horatio, Lucy, and Penance: No.

302
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,083
- - Right. So...

303
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,458
- The Beggar King.
- A bit public for him.

304
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,834
But he runs Odium,

305
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:44,000
and since we have a
hard-won lead on his address...

306
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,125
I'll take it. I know the area.

307
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,834
If Mrs. True isn't
looking for a rematch.

308
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,375
No. I'm going to talk
to Massen. Alone.

309
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,000
You sure that's the way to go?

310
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,750
- He's hardly gonna fall into...
- No, I mean, I'm going to.

311
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,542
Sometime today.
I've already seen it.

312
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,166
Wasn't sure where I was at first,
but... or will be.

313
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,500
Wait,
does... does that mean Massen killed Mary?

314
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,685
Did the ripplings tell you that?

315
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,625
They tell me I don't
get to plan my own day.

316
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,041
They're not treasure maps.

317
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,667
I'll learn something,
I'm sure, but...

318
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,959
And once you have?

319
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,667
I mean, if you get something

320
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,500
in the way of, uh, "he did it."

321
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,208
Then I will bring that
information back here.

322
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,250
I'm not planning to
attack a Peer of the Realm

323
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,533
inside his well-guarded house.

324
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,250
Hmm, sure,
but what you mean to happen

325
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,208
and what actually
happens in the thick of it...

326
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,834
It's not just you, True.

327
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,667
Everyone has to
keep their heads.

328
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,792
Mary's death needs to be answered,
and not with another death.

329
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,667
And it's not just
about what's right.

330
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,166
We're hated right now.

331
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,041
Our first response
cannot be hate.

332
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,667
We'll be lined
up in the streets.

333
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,333
And they may have killed
Mary exactly for that purpose.

334
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,250
Make us do something
they can rain hell on us for.

335
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,333
See? Annie agrees,
and she's terrible.

336
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,583
- And so do I. - Good.

337
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,542
- Level heads.
- All right. Augustus Bidlow?

338
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,208
Yeah, we should murder him.

339
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,959
I'm with Penance.
That party they thrown,

340
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,500
seeing how he treated her,

341
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,917
I nearly pulled off me gloves.

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,417
Lavinia Bidlow, as well.

343
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,101
Or are you just writing
down people you know?

344
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,083
Amalia told her we
were going to the park.

345
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,667
- And she knew where I'd be coming from.
- Still,

346
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,142
she might be a bit over-puckered,
but she's the reason we've got all this.

347
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,333
Mm-hmm. The family that
sponsored my medical training...

348
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:17,208
That brought me from
Jamaica to England...

349
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,792
A week in their house,
and I almost swam back.

350
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,291
I've been left for dead by
men with less contempt.

351
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,125
Now, Miss Bidlow,
she means well,

352
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,500
and I know she does
good work for the Touched,

353
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,458
but it doesn't
make her a friend.

354
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:32,625
So she goes on the list with her terrible,
bird-watching brother.

355
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,458
He's the ringleader.
You know he...

356
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:38,542
Likes... birds.

357
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,125
Birds are stupid.

358
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,542
And it's high time
you told him that.

359
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,667
What? Go and talk... No!

360
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,959
- I should do Annie's.
- Track an assassin?

361
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,750
Come on, Pen,
you can give Bidlow the old parasol.

362
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:52,959
- -Lucy,
Penance, and Horatio: No!

363
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,458
- Oh. - Sorry.

364
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,875
Doctor Cousens,
we got a few peaky ones down there.

365
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,875
- How are you holding up?
- Oh, well,

366
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,417
my Nigel doesn't really
understand what's going on.

367
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
But I'm keeping my chins up.

368
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,083
Sometimes pretending you
feel good makes you feel better.

369
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,125
- Trust me.
- All right.

370
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,041
Let's see to those patients.

371
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,291
- Don't do anything rash.
- I won't.

372
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,417
I was talking to Penance.

373
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,375
Shouldn't
you take Désirée with you

374
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,166
- to Massen's?
- I should.

375
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,583
But I don't.

376
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:46,417
That's a pungent gambit, Tommy.

377
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,959
- - Frank.

378
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,291
Frank!

379
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,625
You've been mixing
with the Purists.

380
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:03,834
Stirring them up.

381
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,333
Did you want to
scare the Touched,

382
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,125
so you could tell 'em they
was only safe with you?

383
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,709
Uh, first of all, who...

384
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,792
- - Who are the fucking Purists?

385
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,083
That's not mine.

386
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,000
You really think I'd be handing
out personalized evidence?

387
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,417
Master Swann.

388
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,208
Any assistance required?

389
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,208
Uh, no, thank you. Uh...

390
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,208
Just a bit of sport.
We'll keep quiet.

391
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,333
This is a members
only establishment.

392
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,959
And you need to
fuck off. Please.

393
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,959
Uh, yes, uh,
do fuck off. There's a lad.

394
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:49,375
Look. Think about this.

395
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,208
If they'd said it was
Lord Such-and-What,

396
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,750
you'd be gathering
evidence. Having him followed.

397
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,792
Behaving like a detective.

398
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,959
Someone pointed you
and pulled your trigger.

399
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,792
It's no secret that
you loathe me.

400
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,458
That don't mean you're innocent.

401
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,166
When... When
have I ever claimed...

402
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:12,792
Wait. Are you talking
about the shooting?

403
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,834
I'm not a murderer.

404
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,000
- I had nothing against Mary.
- She was a rival.

405
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,625
I think you know she wasn't.

406
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,333
Look, I... I will provide
you with my whereabouts.

407
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,500
I wanted to learn
about Amalia True,

408
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:31,542
and what I've
learned is stay away.

409
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,208
- I am not a part of this.
- 'Course you are.

410
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,917
And if it ain't you,
it's one of them toffs you play chess with.

411
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,542
Oh, uh,
actually we call it cheese because we...

412
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,291
It's rich men grinding
up them who's helpless

413
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,166
for extra penny on the pound,

414
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,792
or, or the rights to a
patch of sand. Or a fuck.

415
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,500
- Are we done?
- Oh, we're done, Swann.

416
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,166
Across the board.

417
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,250
And our little arrangement,

418
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,125
my debt, is done.

419
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,834
Cause I got something
over you now.

420
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,583
I don't fucking care.

421
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:13,184
- Translators.
- Bring Klaus?

422
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,166
Yes, bring Klaus. Anyone
who speaks another language,

423
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,166
or who studied a dead
language really well.

424
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,417
I've only got law Latin.

425
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,667
- - Oh, it's trouble.

426
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,476
Well, you can sneak out for a kiss anytime,
but not when I need your help?

427
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,017
- Aneel, you know I wouldn't ask...
- No, of course, I'll do it.

428
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:30,125
Thank you. I love
you. Yeah. Six o'clock.

429
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,291
- Mr. Bidlow. - Oh.

430
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,834
Miss Adair.

431
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,709
Uh, what are you...

432
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:57,000
Uh, so,
does Lavinia know you're here?

433
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,792
I know very well that
I'm not welcome here.

434
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,166
No, you are. You are. It's,
it's...

435
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,542
It's wonderful to...

436
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,250
Did, did anybody see you?

437
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:08,041
You seem a bit nervous.

438
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,375
Well, I mean, I usually am,

439
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:14,291
but, but you're well? No,
Lord, no.

440
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,333
No,
of course. I'm so sorry. Um...

441
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:22,458
May I offer my most sincere
condolences about Miss Brighton?

442
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:25,542
She wouldn't have been
entertaining to your friends,

443
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,291
so you needn't grieve overly.

444
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,375
Lavinia made me do it.

445
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,250
She, she,
she said it would be bad for you.

446
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,208
- Bad for me?
- Yes, that's why I did it.

447
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,458
She said if I didn't,
that there would be cons...

448
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,542
Wait.

449
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,583
Wait, it wa... It was bad.

450
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,375
- So, how is it bad?
- Are you making a joke of this?

451
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:52,709
You can't,
you can't p... Possibly have had any deep,

452
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,542
emotional conn...
connection to...

453
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,425
Oh, no, I'm saying,
I'm saying this all wrong.

454
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,458
I'm saying it wrong.

455
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,875
I thought it was the
gentlemanly thing to do.

456
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,291
Murder?

457
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,250
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh, you are a monster.

458
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,583
And you're gonna go to prison.

459
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,184
- I don't care how rich you are.
- What's happening?

460
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,768
What's happening? I don't
know what's happening.

461
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,559
You just confessed to the
murder of Mary Brighton,

462
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,291
and I made a
wax recording of it.

463
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:22,208
Ugh.

464
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:25,125
- Fuckin' prototype.
- Miss Adair.

465
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:28,125
- You are a terrible person!
- Yes, I know. I know!

466
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,625
But I... I didn't
kill Miss... Can I...

467
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,417
Uh, I'm fine.

468
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,625
I was referring to the party.

469
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,542
It's my... awful...

470
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,667
I was just abominably rude.

471
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,333
And I've barely slept since.

472
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:48,333
When I heard what happened,
I wanted to reach out to you in your grief,

473
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,333
and it just... it seemed... It
seemed opportunistic, or...

474
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,750
You, you didn't kill Mary?

475
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:59,291
Is... is that bad? Um, it's...

476
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,000
Of course you didn't.

477
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,542
You're as gentle as a blush.

478
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,792
But you're still terrible.

479
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,542
Yeah.

480
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:14,000
Tell me just anything that
I can do to make amends.

481
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,208
I cried,

482
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:19,250
which seems petty now to think about,
but...

483
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:24,208
I don't... I don't have a
lot of experience with men.

484
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:27,250
Certainly not of your class,
which from what I've seen...

485
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:31,000
No, nobody is quite as
barbaric as the well-to-do.

486
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,083
Your Lucy had me figured out.

487
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,083
Miss Adair,
I would give anything

488
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,846
if you would erase
that day from your mind.

489
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,458
That's not how it works.

490
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,417
No.

491
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,417
No.

492
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Nor should it be.

493
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,250
Remember my transgressions,

494
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,625
so that I may re-earn your trust honestly,
over time.

495
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:02,333
If we are...

496
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:06,208
If we are to be acquainted,

497
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,792
I shall endeavor...

498
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:11,417
No, no, no,
no! Damn acquaintance.

499
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,417
Acquaintance is
exhausting. I just...

500
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,875
I want to be your friend,
Miss Adair.

501
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:23,792
I want... I want to
become your friend.

502
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,917
You sent the flowers for Mary.

503
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,625
- Was the wreath too much? It was, it was garish.
- No.

504
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:42,208
Do you think your sister
did the murder then?

505
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:43,917
What?

506
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,166
I was only askin'.

507
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,709
Maybe it's your tone of voice.

508
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,208
- How'd you get there?
- I'm Nimble.

509
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:12,166
No, I'm Nimble,

510
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,125
as in,
"How do you do? Nimble Jack.

511
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,017
- But my friends all call me..."
- You didn't answer my question.

512
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:19,500
Well, I'm wondering what a sweet
thing like you is doing 'round here.

513
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,583
I'm from around here.

514
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:25,083
- They don't seem to remember you.
- No, they did.

515
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:29,792
- What do you want?
- A drink, maybe.

516
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:33,333
Light supper? Three
Vicars does a nice eel pie.

517
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,709
Private room.

518
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,458
Too fast?

519
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:45,542
- You work for the Beggar King.
- With.

520
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,750
On occasion.

521
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,875
One of his gang
plays the fiddle.

522
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,417
Gave up an address
to a belligerent widow.

523
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,333
Fiddler said he tried to fight,
but...

524
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,625
she got him pinned,
and squeezed it out of him.

525
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:00,834
Poor Declan. He really
can't find decent help.

526
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:03,583
- Which is why he'd prefer you don't kill Odium.
- Yeah.

527
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,417
This wasn't the
King's work. Come on.

528
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,542
Maladie's man
shoots the Brighton girl.

529
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,417
Beggar King's chief
enforcer goes after the widow.

530
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,417
Someone's puttin' on a show.

531
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I need more than "someone."

532
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,333
Odium knows fuck all.

533
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:21,000
He's dim, bless him,
and he's in for another thrashing.

534
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,750
But he's necessary
to keep the peace.

535
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,917
Keep appearances.

536
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,959
Leave Odium be,

537
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:32,625
and the opium you
torched is bygones.

538
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,125
Friends.

539
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,709
Or... common enemy.

540
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:41,083
- Where is she?
- This lot, he doesn't care about.

541
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:45,518
- Seems like they all remember you.
- Just keep your head down.

542
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,166
Never have, never will.

543
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,000
Thank you for seeing me.

544
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,500
The Bidlows are old friends.

545
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,917
Lavinia and I may not see
eye-to-eye on everything,

546
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,875
but she doesn't waste
her time with trifling people.

547
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,792
I think she regards
you quite highly.

548
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,375
I owe her a great deal.
Everyone at The Orphanage does.

549
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,750
Forgive me. I did read about your girl,
Miss Brighton.

550
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:46,208
I suspect you've had all the
condolences you have room for,

551
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,709
so may I offer you a sherry?

552
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,166
Bit early, but...

553
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,792
And may I also offer

554
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,291
a conjecture?

555
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,875
You think that I had something
to do with your friend's death.

556
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,750
Did you? It would save
me such a lot of time.

557
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:07,208
I'm going to have to disappoint you,
I'm afraid.

558
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:10,125
No one at the club is
vying for credit either,

559
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,667
though I will keep an ear out.

560
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,125
Appreciated.

561
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,834
But, what I could really
use is your perspective,

562
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:20,083
as a military man and a powerful
member of the established order.

563
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,208
Whoever did have Mary Brighton
killed was making a public statement.

564
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,792
Like stepping on stage
and murdering six people.

565
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,875
- A different message.
- The same messenger.

566
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,458
That gunman, Kroos.

567
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:31,166
- Well, he's taken care of.
- Shame.

568
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,500
He might have talked.

569
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,000
You killed her. Let's say.

570
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,500
If you'll indulge me,

571
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,041
I've found this a
useful exercise.

572
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,333
Let's assume it wasn't
Maladie or an erstwhile lover,

573
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,667
but someone with a broader view.

574
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,291
You'll take the part of the
mastermind behind Mary's death.

575
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,458
And you'll be the
irate inspector?

576
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,250
I'll be Mary.

577
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,542
Why would you want me dead?

578
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,458
I doubt that I do.

579
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:02,542
I'm not entirely clear
what your "turn" is.

580
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,875
A beacon of some sort?

581
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,542
Anyway benign,
and you're an inoffensive woman.

582
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,959
No history of radicalism,
I assume.

583
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,375
So why me?

584
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,291
Why not kill that widow,
Mrs. True?

585
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,875
She's a willful creature,

586
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,583
and the leader of
this motley coven.

587
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:19,333
Which means she
must have enemies.

588
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:22,792
Her death might be tragic,
but perhaps not unexpected.

589
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,500
You, on the other hand,
are a pure

590
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,959
and blameless woman.

591
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,291
And all in white, no less.

592
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:32,250
A statuesque beauty
with a mass of auburn hair

593
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,583
and great shining eyes...

594
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,250
Christ, I'm not just a beacon.

595
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,709
I genuinely resemble
a lighthouse.

596
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:44,166
It isn't just a warning.

597
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,917
It's about hope.

598
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,709
It's about pulling the
heart out of the orphans.

599
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,250
I would think so.

600
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,417
In fact, I would say,

601
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,166
Miss Brighton,

602
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,166
that you are a casualty of war.

603
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,625
So we're at war.

604
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:05,917
A few years back,

605
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,834
a pestilence ran
through this city.

606
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:10,875
Some anarchic cabal

607
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,625
found or developed a
power that mocks God.

608
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:18,083
That molests and
disfigures His natural law.

609
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,625
It was an attack on the stability,
the harmony,

610
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:25,375
if you will, of the empire.

611
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,792
And we must show the
victims of this deliberate plague

612
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,125
that they are not special.
They are not a community.

613
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:34,875
Victims is all they
have license to be.

614
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:38,625
If I am your killer revealed,

615
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:41,333
behold the lion,

616
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,083
Great Britain.

617
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,875
An empire unparalleled

618
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:48,041
and unmerciful in
its self-preservation.

619
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,208
My enemy is England.

620
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:56,041
- Well, that narrows it down. Thank God I came.
- I said your killer.

621
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,458
Your enemy, Miss Brighton,

622
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:01,667
is the scum who
caused this plague,

623
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,542
the fools who call it power,

624
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,750
and the woman who
should have known

625
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:09,083
what would happen
to you in that park.

626
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,375
Unless, of course,

627
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,417
she did.

628
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,792
So,
he confessed without confessing.

629
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,333
It was honestly impressive.

630
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,667
I should have worn
your recording frame.

631
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,458
But he didn't
give up his source.

632
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,166
He never flat-out said.

633
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,393
Even if we had proof,
Massen knows we couldn't touch him.

634
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:31,458
- I could touch him.
- Oh, please tell me we're not havin' this talk again.

635
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:34,208
No. Even if he gave the order,

636
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,125
he's part of something
much bigger.

637
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:39,875
Pull out one piece,
it would be replaced in a day.

638
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,834
And damn it, it's wrong.

639
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,875
He's a human being who's alive,
damn it.

640
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,834
We still need a response.

641
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:49,458
If we let murder slide,
it will only slide down.

642
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,875
Whatever's next will be worse.

643
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,625
Even I know that's true.

644
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:57,041
Well,
some of the lads say he has a warehouse

645
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,667
full of munitions
we could torch.

646
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,875
- Hmm.
- I don't think there's anyone in there at night.

647
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:07,500
He deserves much worse,
but it would be a start.

648
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,500
All in favor?

649
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,208
You fuckin' idiot.

650
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,267
You might as well have
marched in the House of Lords

651
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,333
and had a slash!

652
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,208
Superintendent's had an earful.

653
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,542
I was pursuing a lead.

654
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,333
Unless Maladie was
havin' tea in that club,

655
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,810
Superintendent
don't want to hear it.

656
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:24,750
Mundi! Get in here!

657
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,667
It'll be fine.

658
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:31,166
- Can I have your desk?
- You can cop a mouse.

659
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,458
Shh... shh...

660
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:43,750
- Let him go.
- But he lies about me.

661
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,083
He'll stop.

662
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,583
And, and he'll resign,
and, and he'll never

663
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,875
- bother you again...
- Oh, now you're lying! I heard you wouldn't.

664
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:53,125
And, whoa, the papers!

665
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:56,166
They say I killed Mary.
They call me crazy.

666
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,125
I never did it.

667
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,834
I only kill angels. Mostly.

668
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:03,709
I liked Mary so much.

669
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:06,542
She was gonna be my pet,
and sleep on my belly.

670
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:09,375
- You were gonna hang her.
- Well, we had a lot of plans.

671
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,333
She talked about the detective
who was smart, and honest.

672
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,208
And she didn't marry
him because he was sad.

673
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,000
For Mary's sake, will you...

674
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,792
- Will you let him live?
- Oh, she doesn't have a sake, love.

675
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,000
She's dead. She's
all cold in that box.

676
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,083
Everyone crying as
they lowered it in the hole,

677
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:30,625
singin' about the workday,
and what.

678
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,125
Y... You were there?

679
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:36,583
Of course.

680
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,333
I was in the box.

681
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,291
I had a little cuddle.

682
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,959
But she smelled different.

683
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:47,000
And I will not believe
that was her favorite dress.

684
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,500
What do you want?

685
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,917
I want everyone to stop lying.

686
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,834
Can you see to that?

687
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:55,166
I will try.

688
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,625
I have to think about
my reputation.

689
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,750
Things never come
back when they go away.

690
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:06,417
Ha! - Frank: In here! Now!

691
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,000
Oh, Christ.

692
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, no!

693
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,000
That's a form of lying!

694
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,333
No!

695
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,291
Mundi.

696
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,709
Fuck, it's her! It's Maladie!

697
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:02,166
He fucking got her!

698
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,583
Right. Not so scary now...

699
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:07,291
All right.

700
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,333
- - Hey.

701
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,667
Justice.

702
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,000
She gets justice from us.

703
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:18,208
I'll have badge and balls
off any man who tries that.

704
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,000
She gets justice from us.

705
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,333
Okay, everybody.

706
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,917
Ready?

707
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,375
Okay.

708
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:33,083
Right. Myrtle?

709
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,542
Nice and loud.

710
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,208
Myrtle.

711
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,750
A little slower.

712
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,625
Uh...

713
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,750
Again?

714
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,834
Um, uh...

715
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,959
I know it!

716
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:22,625
The darkness.

717
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,375
Dark. Um, uh, before the dark?

718
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,709
Uh, come before the dark.

719
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,333
Sí, sí.

720
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:30,667
Was that near the end?

721
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,667
- - Again.

722
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,333
My mate said the
warehouse... Yeah.

723
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:04,792
It's that one.

724
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,792
And the entrance
is on the far side.

725
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,875
And that lot?

726
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,542
I promised Penance.

727
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,267
- Because it's your turn again!
- No, it ain't my turn to get the cup.

728
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,434
- I always got to get the cup.
- Just do what you're told, all right?

729
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,518
If the foreman finds out we've left...

730
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:20,375
Do you hear that?

731
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,625
Bloody hell. What
the blazes is that?

732
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:38,375
Do you ever think
maybe Penance is frightening?

733
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:42,583
And what were you gonna
do? Hand 'em a daisy?

734
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,542
- Stay outside.
- I'm the one with the fire.

735
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,542
And we need to make
sure no one goes up in it.

736
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,458
Your funeral.

737
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:29,917
- No one. - Looks good.

738
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,625
Due to ship out at dawn.

739
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,917
I'd like to see his face.

740
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,184
Let's open a couple. Make
sure we have the right shipment.

741
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,667
You sure the guards
are still sleepin'?

742
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,083
We have time.

743
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:45,166
Yeah. No,
I just have that... that feeling.

744
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,500
Lucy.

745
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,250
Open the crate.

746
00:43:57,208 --> 00:44:00,166
Well,
now we know why the war isn't going better.

747
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:04,875
They swore they were weapons,
True.

748
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:07,542
They must be workin' for...

749
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,709
- How'd you cop it?
- It was the rippling.

750
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:22,542
Your talk of Massen's
hunting. His trophies.

751
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:25,333
You'd have to have been
in his study to call that up.

752
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,458
I might have missed it
if I hadn't seen it twice.

753
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:31,500
- My clapper of a mouth.
- And then this perfectly convenient plan.

754
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:34,709
Warehouse of munitions
no one's really guarding?

755
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:36,542
Christ,
it was all already there.

756
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,125
The questions, the absences,

757
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,568
the money you swore you didn't
steal so we'd assume you did.

758
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,476
- I figured that'd get a bit tired.
- You clean my study,

759
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,834
but you can't make your
own bed. I am such an idiot.

760
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,750
I didn't know what they
was plannin' for Mary.

761
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:51,166
- I swear.
- What else would they have ever done,

762
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,959
after you told them
Mary was a beacon?

763
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:57,125
- What do you want, True?
- I want it to be someone else!

764
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,917
I want it to be Harriet, or Jo.

765
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,917
Or the one who does,
she... Helen.

766
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,792
- Maud.
- The one who does the cartwheels. Fuck!

767
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,542
You were the first woman,
the first woman

768
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,875
to walk through those doors!

769
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,500
The one I could lean
on instead of protecting,

770
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,917
that understood the world

771
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,500
- the way that I do.
- You don't know fuck about the world.

772
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,792
All your war stories.

773
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:25,792
You don't know which war. Oh,
oh, it's awful.

774
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:28,417
'Cause you've left
bodies on the field,

775
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,458
and you're all damaged.

776
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:34,625
I broke my son to pieces.

777
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:40,000
I held my baby,
and it killed him.

778
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:43,166
And it wasn't
sudden like I said.

779
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,250
The breaks, they were sudden.

780
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:51,333
But he... he held on.

781
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:53,375
And he screamed.

782
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:58,917
He screamed longer
than I did pushin' him out...

783
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,959
'fore his heart gave.

784
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:06,542
So you tell me, are we sisters?

785
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:10,667
It's been three years since
I've touched another person.

786
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,834
And Massen,
he says he'll find a cure.

787
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:15,417
Of course he tells you that.

788
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,709
And what are you telling us?

789
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:21,291
A better world?

790
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:24,625
How many of your precious
orphans would be lining up

791
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:26,500
to be free of your better world

792
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,250
if they had half a chance?

793
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,667
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

794
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,083
I don't know what happened.

795
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:34,709
How do you know how
it's supposed to be?

796
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Did you do this?

797
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,709
Did you make this nightmare?

798
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:45,041
I just got left behind.

799
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:50,291
'Course you got left
behind. What good are you?

800
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:52,125
You, a leader?

801
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:54,083
You're out whoring
when your girls need...

802
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:58,375
Your boss told me
today that we're at war.

803
00:46:58,458 --> 00:46:59,792
I didn't start it.

804
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:02,667
I didn't even
volunteer. But he's right.

805
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,000
I hope he told you what
happens to spies during wartime.

806
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,041
Is that what this is?

807
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:12,792
There's rules of engagement.

808
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:16,375
And not just you needing to
take your failure out on someone.

809
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,417
You think Penance
will forgive you for this?

810
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,041
You think Mary would?

811
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,476
And that's where you lose me.

812
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,917
You're finished in
London. Forever.

813
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,709
Annie and I will put you on
a boat and you'll stay on it

814
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:59,458
until you're well
and fucking gone.

815
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:01,542
And you'll tell me
everything you know.

816
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:04,000
Everything. Yes?

817
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,917
Where are the real munitions?

818
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:18,500
A fire? Oh, no!

819
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:19,976
- It's everywhere.
- How?

820
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,959
My men were just
doing the rounds.

821
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:24,083
Everything exploded,
and it was, it was chaos!

822
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,083
Was anyone at
the factory harmed?

823
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
No, it was the factory, the...

824
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,625
Luckily no one was hurt.

825
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,875
The Paul Street
storage building.

826
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,041
I see.

827
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,917
This wasn't the plan.

828
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,458
Well, it was your plan,
wasn't it?

829
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:12,208
I'm just your instrument.

830
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:18,208
I've always been
your instrument.

831
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:23,083
Why won't you play me?

832
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:27,250
Why?

833
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:32,250
I still can't make sense of it.

834
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,458
- Lucy.
- We should have seen it a long time ago.

835
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,375
I just hope she's the only one.

836
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:41,250
Losing her the same
day we buried M...

837
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,875
Anyway,
I'm grateful you spared her life.

838
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,792
I didn't.

839
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,750
You did.

840
00:50:51,792 --> 00:50:53,542
That idiotic pin.

841
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:55,935
She could have gotten away,
but she wouldn't leave without it.

842
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:58,458
That was always my plan,
of course.

843
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:04,417
She said I had no idea what
anyone is going through here.

844
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:08,583
I hate that she's right.

845
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:12,166
But I can't... get
close to them.

846
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,458
Lucy's proof of that.

847
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,458
She shows her face in
London again though,

848
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:20,333
it'll take more than a
piece of jewelry to save her.

849
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:25,583
So, um,
a bigger piece of jewelry?

850
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,417
A belt, maybe, or a hat?

851
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,625
True,
I can't make her a whole outfit.

852
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:34,417
You are the strangest
person I've ever met.

853
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,667
It's why you're the one I trust.

854
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,583
Augie Bidlow's Touched.

855
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:44,959
Birds. He sort of controls them.

856
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:47,250
I'll be damned.

857
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,583
Do you think that's why
Lavinia took up the cause?

858
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,417
He's certain she doesn't know.

859
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,458
I think he's afraid to tell her.

860
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:55,542
But he's not afraid to tell you.

861
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:59,125
- - You're here!

862
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:01,500
- They're here! - We are here.

863
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:04,500
- You won't believe it.
- Myrtle, what's wrong?

864
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,125
No, it's not wrong at all.

865
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:09,125
Harriet, tell them. It was
mostly Harriet that worked it out.

866
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:10,834
I helped with the French,
though.

867
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:12,458
Harriet, please.

868
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:15,291
I'm sorry,
it... I don't want to say it wrong.

869
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:17,375
And it,
it wasn't me. It was Myrtle.

870
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:25,291
Myrtle understood
Mary's song. Mostly.

871
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,458
Even Mary didn't know
what her songs meant...

872
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:28,709
She always said.

873
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:31,125
Some of it was more
about emotion than...

874
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,000
Or emotion plus semantics,

875
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,792
but she remembered a lot. She
just didn't know how to tell us.

876
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,417
Myrtle.

877
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,458
- What did she say?
- Uh, she said, "You're not alone."

878
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:47,417
- Well, I think we could all feel that...
- You, Mrs. True.

879
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:50,750
She said it to you.

880
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:55,333
She said, "Amalia,
my lonely soldier."

881
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:59,000
Um,
something about wearing stripes.

882
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,667
But that part...

883
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,041
But she said,
"I didn't leave you.

884
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:07,000
"I went into,
in-inside the city.

885
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,125
I was damaged..." uh,
"incomplete?

886
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,583
"I had to heal.

887
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:15,000
- Soon we will all be ready..."
- Oh, that part was me.

888
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:18,667
"But it's dark.
There's a darkness."

889
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:23,125
She said to-to everyone,
all of us,

890
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,250
to gather,

891
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:28,458
and protect each other.

892
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:31,208
Because of the dark.

893
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:40,834
And was there more?

894
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:45,458
Uh, "Find me.

895
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,583
"Let them help, those who will,

896
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:49,959
but come below and find me."

897
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,709
Um...

898
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:57,667
"Come before the dark,
and we can save..."

899
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:01,458
It ended there. That's when...

900
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,667
Those aren't Mary's words,
are they?

901
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:15,333
That was someone
else talking through her.

902
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,000
That's right.

903
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:21,000
Then who?

904
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:24,333
Who do we need to find?

905
00:56:26,959 --> 00:56:31,000
Maladie is the worst
killer in London's history.

906
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:35,291
This is a case where
justice must be seen.

907
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,125
There is a concern about
enflaming the Touched.

908
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:49,041
We keep the Touched accountable,
visible.

909
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:53,500
If London is going to be safe from chaos,
it needs

910
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:54,667
to see chaos.

911
00:56:55,834 --> 00:57:00,333
What I want from
you is just... enough.

912
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,750
We all have a soul,
no matter what viciousness

913
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:06,354
people are spewing.

914
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,625
Let the world see,
the Touched are not here

915
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:09,959
to be slaughtered for show.

916
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,750
Amalia,
before this Massen scene,

917
00:57:24,834 --> 00:57:26,667
has had a ripple that tells her

918
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:29,542
that she will be at his estate.

919
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,476
Mary's
death needs to be answered,

920
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,709
and not with another death.

921
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,208
I'm going to talk to Massen,
alone.

922
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:43,500
The confrontation scene
between Amalia and Massen

923
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,208
is really interesting.

924
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,291
You think that I had something
to do with your friend's death?

925
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,500
Did you? It would save
me such a lot of time.

926
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,583
We flipped roles,
and he uncharacteristically,

927
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:56,375
as you would think,
simply goes along with it.

928
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,017
You'll take the part
of the mastermind

929
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,083
behind Mary's death.

930
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,208
And you'll be the
irate inspector?

931
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:02,417
I'll be Mary.

932
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:03,935
You wouldn't
have thought that would happen

933
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:06,166
in a conventional 1899 drama

934
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,333
with conventional
gender stereotypes.

935
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:09,792
These people are roleplaying

936
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,458
in a way that's
really very modern,

937
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:14,166
as a way of trying to find
the truth of the situation.

938
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:18,375
But an amazing scene to shoot
because it's just so ambivalent

939
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:21,959
and ambiguous the whole time,
and wonderful to get, you know,

940
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,959
toe to toe with
Laura in that scene.

941
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,166
That was my favorite day,
I think, really, so far.

942
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:29,125
It was great having that scene with him,
and also seeing that

943
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:33,041
it's kind of two adversaries,
but nobody saying anything

944
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,291
in clear and plain language.

945
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:38,166
If I am your killer revealed,

946
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,125
behold the liar
of Great Britain,

947
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:42,375
an empire unparalleled and...

948
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:45,250
unmerciful in its
self-preservation.

949
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:48,417
Filming
at Knebworth is incredible,

950
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,166
because it's this huge
Gothic Tudor building

951
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,959
with so much history.

952
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:56,125
And it seems fitting
that something

953
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:58,000
that solid and powerful

954
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,875
has a man who would
be that solid and powerful.

955
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:04,291
So,
it very much embodies Massen's spirit.

956
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:07,166
Knebworth has these
extraordinary gates

957
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,875
with vast great dragons on them.

958
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:12,208
So, the exterior is fantastic,
but the inside's lovely as well.

959
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:15,000
When you look
at old Victorian photographs,

960
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:20,000
to any of the interiors of
Victorian prominent gentlemen,

961
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,208
you would find a lot of them
would have hunting trophies,

962
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:24,709
and things on the wall.

963
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,417
To do the interior
of Massen's estate,

964
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,750
you're looking at maybe
not antiques and furniture

965
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:33,917
from that Victorian period,
because they would often

966
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
have them maybe 50
or 100 years earlier.

967
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,959
So,
you're looking at really fine antiques.

968
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:44,125
Amalia notices
all his hunting trophies,

969
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:45,500
and his armor...

970
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:47,834
It speaks to his power, I think.

971
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,625
I suppose
you can say Massen is a villain.

972
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:54,041
In modern day,
he looks like a villain

973
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,583
in his black and
his high collar.

974
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:57,458
Actually,
that was just what men wore then.

975
00:59:57,709 --> 01:00:00,291
I love the way the men
have to hold their head

976
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:02,417
with these incredibly
high collars sometimes.

977
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,875
What I really enjoy is,
as a costume develops,

978
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:07,166
you see the character emerge.

979
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,333
Particularly Amalia,
with the corset.

980
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:11,208
It was incredibly important

981
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:15,208
that she would really want
to be controlled and precise.

982
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:20,291
Some anarchic cabal
found or developed a power

983
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:21,291
that mocks God.

984
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,542
It was an attack on the empire.

985
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:25,709
So we're at war.

986
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,959
Massen doesn't
believe that the Touched

987
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,792
represent progress
of any good kind.

988
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:35,083
He is the living,
breathing embodiment

989
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,166
of the patriarchy,

990
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:39,959
and power as it
exists in that society.

991
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:43,792
Massen embodies that empire
and the values of that empire,

992
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,792
and if that means
people being sacrificed,

993
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,667
then that's the
way it's gonna go.

994
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,333
Massen, I suppose,
is fundamentally a bad guy,

995
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:52,792
in that he's about
destroying the Touched.

996
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,709
We always ask
ourselves about villains,

997
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:56,417
"How do they get
to be like this?"

998
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,333
With Massen,
he lost his wife young,

999
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,583
and now he's lost a child.

1000
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,875
So,
that makes him rather compelling.

1001
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:07,166
If you have a personal tragedy,

1002
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,959
all that does is fortify

1003
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,458
your allegiance
to the larger force.

1004
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,041
So,
the larger British Empire for Massen.

1005
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:16,500
There's a regular power play

1006
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:18,333
between Massen and Amalia.

1007
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:21,166
He's the old power,
she represents the new power,

1008
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:23,917
and neither one of them
is gonna give that up easily.

1009
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:29,041
So, I think she comes out
of there feeling frustrated...

1010
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:30,834
and angry.

1011
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:32,792
So he confessed
without confessing?

1012
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,083
It was honestly impressive.

1013
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:38,625
Amalia is
looking for how she is supposed

1014
01:01:38,709 --> 01:01:42,542
to be moving forward,
but she really is quite lost.

1015
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:44,709
I was left here completely alone

1016
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,250
with nothing but a mission
I was never actually given.

1017
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:50,375
She is learning where to find

1018
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:53,291
the information that she needs,
and the thing that...

1019
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:56,542
really sets that in motion,
first of all, of course, is...

1020
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:58,291
Is hearing Mary's song.

1021
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:02,709
Myrtle's turn is she can
speak every language,

1022
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:04,375
she can understand
every language.

1023
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:08,166
So she does understand
everything Mary's saying.

1024
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,000
And she also knows she
cannot say what it means.

1025
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,500
She can't communicate
that with anyone.

1026
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:18,333
And she knows that
this is life-changing

1027
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:19,959
for everyone around her.

1028
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:23,208
When Mary sang,
you heard words, language.

1029
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:27,041
Primrose and Harriet kind
of seize this opportunity.

1030
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,750
She's trying to
communicate with us

1031
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:30,959
what she heard Mary sing.

1032
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:35,750
We tried really hard to
include as many as we could.

1033
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:37,458
You know, Asian languages,

1034
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:40,500
Afro languages,
European languages.

1035
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:43,834
It was a little
bit dictated by...

1036
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,417
what contacts we had.

1037
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:53,792
Viola is a remarkable person,
because she's so good

1038
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:58,417
at picking up the sounds
and the rhythms of a language,

1039
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,667
and the tune of a language.

1040
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,000
She kind of absorbs that very,
very quickly.

1041
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:07,125
Myrtle...

1042
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,208
A little slower.

1043
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,959
But I think we both felt
we want to do justice here,

1044
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,417
if we're going to
use a bit of Afrikaans,

1045
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,291
if we're going to
use a bit of Dutch,

1046
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,917
or Turkish, or whatever it is,

1047
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,417
we want to try
and do that justice.

1048
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:28,291
So,
I put out an email to the whole crew.

1049
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,375
The response was phenomenal!
Loads of people got involved,

1050
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:35,083
and translated
pieces of script for us.

1051
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:39,458
We had something like 30,
40 languages.

1052
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:40,685
I just thought it was fantastic.

1053
01:03:40,709 --> 01:03:42,709
It was really joyous,
this coming together.

1054
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:46,375
It's
sadly quite unusual in the world

1055
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:49,125
for so many different
cultures to come together

1056
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:50,834
and help each other.

1057
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:53,542
We had some very,
very interesting debates,

1058
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,625
you know. I'd say,
"Oh, um, can you say,

1059
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,125
'Because of the darkness,
'" and people would say,

1060
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:02,834
"When you say 'darkness',
what do you mean?

1061
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:07,458
Do you mean total black?
Do you mean night-time?"

1062
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,184
- I know it. "Darkness."
- "Dark..."

1063
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,208
And, um, "before the dark?"

1064
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:14,291
Uh, "Come before the dark."

1065
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,208
Si!

1066
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:16,458
That's so incredible,

1067
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:18,083
that we're going
into this detail.

1068
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:19,917
And you suddenly realize that

1069
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:22,625
English has some words
that cover some things,

1070
01:04:22,709 --> 01:04:25,208
but other languages
have amazing words.

1071
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,267
It's just really exciting,

1072
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:28,851
'cause it's the coming together
of a lot of different people

1073
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,267
who speak a lot of
different languages,

1074
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:31,667
and can't necessarily
communicate

1075
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,041
with one another clearly,

1076
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:37,125
but still have the ability to do it,
regardless.

1077
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:39,959
They were able to
find out what Mary's song meant,

1078
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,792
so that's finally a message.

1079
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:42,875
What did she say?

1080
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:46,959
She said, "You're not alone."
She said it to you, Mrs. True.

1081
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:53,125
And "There's a darkness."
She said to everyone, all of us.

1082
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:58,709
So, it's really just a kind of
blind scrape through the dark

1083
01:04:58,792 --> 01:04:59,992
to get where she needs to get,

1084
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,667
in the hope that there is
some light at the end of that.

1085
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,667
- Was there more? - "Find me."

1086
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,625
Who do we need to find?

1087
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,190
