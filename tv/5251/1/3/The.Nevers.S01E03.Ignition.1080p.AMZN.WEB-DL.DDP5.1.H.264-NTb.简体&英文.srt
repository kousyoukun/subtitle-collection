1
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,687
三名触能者对大众宣战
Three of the Touched declared war on society.

2
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:13,054
目前你们每人都成了嫌疑者
Right now, every one of you is suspect.

3
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,144
蒙迪督察  似乎
AMALIA TRUE: Inspector Mundi clearly has

4
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:18,097
与玛丽有些私人利害关系
a personal interest in Mary Brighton.

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,267
玛丽的异能是什么
What is Mary's turn?

6
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:21,887
让玛丽开口唱
PENANCE ADAIR: You get Mary singin',

7
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:24,187
召唤所有触能者
all the Touched, they'll all come to us.

8
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,887
你打算正式经营菲礼曼俱乐部
You're turning your club into a business.

9
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:28,887
梅森认为触能者是瘟疫
Massen thinks the Touched are a plague.

10
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,767
我认为是宝藏
I think they're a gold mine.

11
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:32,767
我俩可以合伙
We can be partners.

12
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:34,727
你是其中一人吗
Are you one of them?

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,767
我一直想找出那个火花
I keep looking for that spark.

14
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:42,437
也许黑暗就在她计划之中
Maybe your darkness is part of her plan.

15
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:46,847
我要在她杀死玛丽之前找到麦拉蒂
AMALIA: I'm going to find Maladie before Mary's dead.

16
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:58,017
辛苦你了  折腾一整天
I'm sorry for your terrible day.

17
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:54,807
大家来吧
Come on, lads.

18
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,137
好极了
Pretty.

19
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:26,557
去告诉乞丐王  别想在这一带码头混了
Tell the Beggar King he's done on these docks.

20
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:30,057
不付钱就别想运货
No pay-ups. No shipments.

21
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,557
从这里到迪克码头
From here straight to Dicker's Wharf,

22
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:35,097
莱姆豪斯区归火焰安妮管
Limehouse belongs to Bonfire Annie.

23
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,517
我们走
Thug: Let's go.

24
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:40,517
看他要亲自或派人来跟我谈
He decides to argue the case, or send anyone else to,

25
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:43,517
就不信他找得到靠山
there's not a shadow he can hide in.

26
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:47,017
我这座靠山如何
Amalia: Not even this one?

27
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:55,437
这招如何
-Amalia: How about that one?

28
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,437
说说看我为何不该杀你
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you. -

29
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:03,137
你早该杀了我
I think you should, uh-- -

30
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:06,727
- 去你的  - 我灭火筒里装的量  足以把你包成木乃伊
Fuck off. -I've enough snuffer in here to mummify you.

31
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:09,057
- 你也一样  楚夫人  - 什么
The same goes for you, Mrs. True. -What?

32
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:11,387
情况比原先说的还要暴力
This scenario's a slight more violent than advertised.

33
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:13,727
- 你说要找她谈话  - 我们是啊  这就是我们的语言
You said we were going to speak. -We are. This is our language.

34
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,477
- 那你没比她好到哪里去  - 我比她好多了
And now you're no better than her. -I am much better than her.

35
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:18,637
- 动手打人就是不对  - 吵死了
Not if you punch her in the face-- -Christ!

36
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,807
别再喷了
Don't. All right.

37
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:23,307
好  来谈和吧
Parlay.

38
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:25,637
想说什么快说  再听到你俩吵架
You can speak your peace, but I will burn us all to death

39
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,347
我就放火同归于尽
if I have to hear you bicker.

40
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:31,267
潘妮丝  你先去灭火  以免火势扩大
Penance, you think maybe you could put out that fire before it spreads?

41
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,727
我们不会打架
Uh... -We won't fight.

42
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,767
她怎么有办法偷袭我
How in fuck's name did that girl sneak up on me?

43
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,637
我们比你还早到
Amalia: We were here before you were.

44
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:45,097
乞丐王的手下不怎么细心
The Beggar King's men aren't notably attentive.

45
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:46,307
潘妮丝甚至打了个喷嚏
Penance even sneezed once.

46
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:48,807
- 你怎么知道我在这里  - 我看见了
How'd you know I was here? -I saw it.

47
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:53,347
我看见火焰和马车  我的转变能力就是能预视
The fire, the cart. It's my "turn." Ripplings.

48
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,437
我还是有点想杀了你
I do still want to kill you a bit.

49
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:59,307
尽管动手  被她发现我可不帮你说话
Go ahead. But I'm not covering for you when she finds out.

50
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,937
我不知道麦拉蒂的下落
I don't know where Maladie is,

51
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:04,847
我也不打算自首
and I'm not turning myself in,

52
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:07,267
我希望你加入我们
or any kind of-- -I want you to join us.

53
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,017
到孤儿院来
At The Orphanage. -

54
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:12,687
- 你刚才说想杀我  - 人就是矛盾
And you want to kill me. -We're all contradictions.

55
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,687
你差点杀了我的挚友
You nearly killed my best friend,

56
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,017
却也救了我
and you saved my life.

57
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,687
- 那是不小心的  - 那是你的反射动作
Yeah, that was an accident. -It was a reflex.

58
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,387
我认为是你的本能
I think it was your natural instinct.

59
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:23,347
我的本能是放火烧东西
My natural instinct is to burn things down.

60
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,017
这点我们承受得住
We can accommodate that.

61
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,887
这就是你的使命吗
Is that the mission you were going on about?

62
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,227
玛丽布莱顿唱催眠曲  召唤所有触能者
Mary Brighton brings in all the Touched with her little lullaby,

63
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:34,687
- 然后推翻君政  - 没那么冠冕堂皇
then we overthrow the monarchy. -Nothing that grand.

64
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,437
也没那么小家子气
Or that small.

65
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:39,267
我离开麦拉蒂了  受不了她老是打哑谜
I quit Maladie 'cause I was sick of riddles.

66
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,387
反正也没继续赚钱
And we'd stopped making money.

67
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:45,097
许多人丧生了  我们触能者
You know we're dying. The Touched.

68
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:48,187
我们遭到攻击  囚禁  丢到大街上
We're being attacked, locked up, and thrown in the street.

69
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,437
不是每个触能者的转变  都能吓阻人
Not everyone got such a formidable "turn."

70
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,767
情况愈来愈糟  你也有未知的敌人
And it's getting worse. You have enemies you don't know about yet.

71
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:57,937
所以要我躲在  你们那帮可怜蠢蛋背后吗
So I should hide with your sad little gaggle?

72
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:02,437
我靠自己就行
I'm fine all by myself.

73
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,517
你的感受还在
You still feel it.

74
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:08,637
玛丽那天唱的歌  你知道有更美好的世界
Mary's song. You know what a better world could be like.

75
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:11,767
那份感受不是真的
It isn't real, that feeling.

76
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:15,517
只是幻想而已  你跟我一样不相信
It's a fantasy. You don't trust it any more than I do.

77
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:19,307
干脆去吸那整车  被我烧毁的鸦片
Might as well have been that cart full of opium I just torched.

78
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,727
整车的什么
Cart full of what? -

79
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,597
别滚嘛  宝贝
Penance: Don't roll away, lovely.

80
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:27,347
我会补偿你的
I'll make it up to you.

81
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:33,057
我跌在我的灭火筒上
I fell on my snuffer.

82
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:36,267
我不喜欢那些迎面而来的烟
I don't like all that smoke to come at me.

83
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:39,887
这位英雄垫住我才没受伤
This hero broke my fall.

84
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:43,267
我的背没事
My back feels fine.

85
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:46,517
感觉刺刺的  跟我的手指一样
Tingling, like my hand fingers.

86
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:50,187
她发现了更美好的世界
She found a better world. -

87
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:54,977
好多个我
Ugh. That's too many of me.

88
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:00,227
艾梅莉亚  来看我的灵魂  困在罐子里
Amalia, come and see my soul trapped in a jar.

89
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:04,937
轻轻摩擦  我能许你愿望
If you rub it, I'll give you wishes.

90
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:07,767
你绝对猜不到那火是什么
You'll never guess what the fire was.

91
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:11,097
- 是鸦片  亲爱的  - 是空气
It's opium, my love. -But it was the air.

92
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:13,847
也是渴望雷电的云
But also the cloud that wanted thunder

93
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:16,687
却因为太轻柔而留不住它
but was too gentle to hold it.

94
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:22,687
火焰安妮走掉了
Ugh... Bonnie Annie's gone away.

95
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:35,597
好了  今晚吸够多鸦片了
Come on. That's enough opium for tonight.

96
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,637
不然还是
Well, maybe just...

97
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:41,887
我去看看  你在这里等
Okay, let me check. You stay here.

98
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,057
你感受到那不是雷的雷吗
Did you feel the thunder that wasn't?

99
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,307
我常有这种感觉
I feel it all the time.

100
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,597
我们的工作最棒了
We have the best jobs.

101
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:41,937
火焰安妮断然拒绝
Amalia: Bonfire Annie, a flat no.

102
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,937
玛丽惊吓过度唱不出来
Mary's too shaken to sing.

103
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:46,057
茉朵的转变没人听得懂
Myrtle's "turn" is being incomprehensible.

104
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:48,437
我可真是成功在望
I am really racking up the wins.

105
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:51,557
- 还有  麦拉蒂是我一手造成的  - 你明知不是这样
Oh, and I created Maladie. -You know you didn't.

106
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,137
- 你做了困难的抉择  - 问题是她又不知道
You made a difficult choice. -She doesn't know that.

107
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:58,137
我都快忘记她了  这样似乎更糟糕
I still hardly remember her. Makes it worse, somehow.

108
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,637
请深呼吸  别说话
Breathe without talking, please.

109
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:05,437
可以了
All right.

110
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:08,637
你的冒险之夜对肺没好处
Your lungs are no better for your wild night out.

111
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:10,557
所幸伤口没破裂
You managed not to rupture a wound.

112
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,727
潘妮丝呢  她止住呕吐了
And Penance? She did stop vomiting.

113
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,307
她很坚强
She's a strong girl.

114
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:17,347
但是你不该带她
But you got no business bringing her along

115
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:19,307
去冒险
on these dangerous excursions,

116
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,267
毕竟麦拉蒂对她做过那种事
after what Maladie did to her.

117
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:22,687
我又没带她去找麦拉蒂
I didn't bring her to Maladie's.

118
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,437
你不晓得会遇上什么状况
You didn't know what you were walking into.

119
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,517
两次都是  你一直都这样
Either time. Any time.

120
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,727
设法把安妮带进孤儿院
Right, you tried to bring Bonfire Annie into the fold.

121
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,517
不是困难抉择  而是鲁莽轻率
That's not a difficult choice. That's just reckless.

122
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:34,517
- 她可是杀人凶手  - 我也是杀人凶手
She's a killer, for Christ's sake. -I'm a killer.

123
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,187
你是士兵  但潘妮丝不是
You're a soldier, and Penance isn't one.

124
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:42,057
- 她会是的  - 是朋友就不该愿她遭逢此厄运
She will be. -That's a terrible fate to wish on a friend.

125
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:47,437
发生的事有哪件如我所愿的
Do you think anything that's happening has to do with what I wish?

126
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,597
请别让她变成鸦片烟鬼
Just try to keep her from becoming an opium fiend.

127
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,437
你也知道年轻人不听老人言
Well, you know young people these days. They never listen.

128
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:56,557
对  你也不是好榜样
Yeah, and they're not gonna learn it from you.

129
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:59,727
- 何瑞休  - 这并不好笑
Horatio. -It's not funny.

130
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:03,637
一点也不有趣
It's not fun.

131
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,387
眼睁睁看你
Watching you throw yourself at danger

132
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,637
恣意投身险境
like you think it's gonna propose.

133
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,017
一再到这里
Coming here,

134
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:12,637
- 来为你疗伤  - 可以很有趣的
to patch you up over and over-- -It could be fun.

135
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:16,227
- 艾梅莉亚  我们已经说过了  - 当时很有趣
Amalia, we've been through this. -It was fun.

136
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,977
不只有趣而已
It was more than fun.

137
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,057
我每天晚上
Every night I have... -

138
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,267
看谁跑得快
Race you! -

139
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,937
我和妻子一起吃晚餐
I sit at dinner across from my wife,

140
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:29,977
我知道一些她不知道的事
and I know something that she doesn't know.

141
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:32,187
会让她痛彻心扉的事
Something that will pull her heart out,

142
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,767
唯一让我稍感宽慰的
and the only comfort I have or I could give

143
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:37,937
就是知道我已经抽身
is the knowledge that I walked away from it.

144
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:40,097
你并没断得一干二净
You didn't get very far.

145
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:45,767
难道对我而言很轻松吗
Do you think it's easy for me?

146
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,347
艾梅莉亚·楚的事都不轻松
Horatio: Nothing's easy for Amalia True.

147
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,477
她肩负拯救世界之重责
She has the weight of the world.

148
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:56,557
抱歉我无法大方承认  我是你的错误
I'm sorry I can't be more generous about being your mistake.

149
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:07,267
凯西和金红发女孩跳华尔滋
Casey would waltz with a strawberry blonde ?

150
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:11,387
乐声悠扬演奏
All: ? And the band played on ?

151
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:15,767
他和心仪女孩一同翩翩滑步
He'd glide 'cross the floor with a girl he adored ?

152
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:19,937
乐声悠扬演奏
And the band played on ?

153
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:22,807
但他脑中千头万绪
But his brain was so loaded ?

154
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:28,517
可怜的女孩吓得发抖
Poor girl would shake with delight ?

155
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:32,637
他和金红发女孩永不分离
All: ? He'd ne'er leave the girl with the strawberry curls ?

156
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:37,267
乐声悠扬演奏
? And the band played on... ? -

157
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,597
不必因为我停下来  请继续
No need to stop on my account, please.

158
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,557
你有想听的歌曲吗  楚夫人
Is there a song you'd like, Mrs. True?

159
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:47,517
都是你们没听过的  请继续唱
None you'd know, but keep playing.

160
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:51,637
楚夫人要的是另一种歌曲
-Mrs. True needs a different kind of song.

161
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:54,187
我得努力找回那天的声音
I should be working to get that voice back.

162
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,307
就让她弹琴吧
Oh, let her play.

163
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:58,437
可以别把我当成坏人吗
Can I not be made the villain of the piece?

164
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:00,097
我都说了请继续唱
I said keep playing.

165
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:01,767
时候到了那首歌就会出现
The other song will come when it comes.

166
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:04,597
开心一点只有好处  没坏处
I doubt a little fun will do anything but help.

167
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:07,267
等待期间没事做才会痛苦
Waiting's only painful when you're not doing anything else.

168
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,977
艾梅莉亚·楚在传福音了  她是耐心的守护神
The gospel of Amalia True, patron saint of patience,

169
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:13,017
同时也是揍人的守护神  大家早
and ironically, fist-punching. Good morning.

170
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:15,597
艾戴尔小姐 今早居然如此精力充沛
Miss Adair, you're surprisingly sprightly this morning.

171
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:19,097
我昨晚边呕吐时突发奇想
I had a vision in the night in between vomits.

172
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:21,727
上次玛丽在众人面前唱
First time Mary sang in public,

173
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,137
只有剧院里的触能者听到
only the Touched that were in the room could hear it.

174
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:27,267
下次我打算让玛丽的歌声
But next time, we'll make Mary's voice loud enough

175
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:29,727
让全城触能者都听见
that it can be heard by Touched across the city--

176
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:31,477
你是指坎多马斯公园吧
You say Candlemas Park is the place, right?

177
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,057
那里很空旷  而且
It's open on all sides, and there's the--

178
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:34,887
而且位于市中心
Penance: And it's right in the center of the city.

179
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:38,557
但昨晚我也注意到城市很吵杂
But I was noticing last night that the city is loud.

180
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:40,557
就算真言也难敌噪音
Even pure truth would choke on the din.

181
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:42,887
说穿了声音就是振动波
But every voice is just vibrations,

182
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:45,017
可以用电能转换器将音波
and an electric converter could make those vibrations

183
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,347
放大
a lot bigger.

184
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:50,017
潘妮丝艾戴尔  你发明了扩音器吗
Penance Adair, have you just invented the amplifier?

185
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:51,307
你破坏惊喜了
Ah, you gave it away!

186
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,137
而且还取了无聊的名字
And you gave it a very dull name.

187
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:56,887
我称之为布莱扬声器
I'll be calling it "The Brightener."

188
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:00,637
改编自你的姓氏
It's a play on words involving your name.

189
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:03,057
谢谢你
Well, thanks.

190
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:07,517
我不懂它的作用
Um, that's... Um, I-I don't know what it is.

191
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,187
它可以
Oh, it, um..

192
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:14,387
扩大音波
amplifies the sound waves.

193
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,437
让你的声音传到几哩外
It-it'll make your voice heard for miles,

194
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,807
或将近一哩
or near a mile, I think.

195
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:21,937
看起来四四方方的  设计部分晚点再想
They're-they're awful boxy. Design elements usually come later on.

196
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,977
只需一些铜线
But all I need is some copper wire,

197
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,887
我就能做出原型
and we'll have some prototypes.

198
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:28,347
不如晚点我们到公园去
I say we go to the park

199
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:32,347
先做些测试
later on this evening, and we just run some tests.

200
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,847
我还以为我睡饱了
And to think I slept.

201
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,477
你向来不够看
You always were a lightweight.

202
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:48,887
我想我快要能唱了
Look, I think I am getting closer to it.

203
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,807
我有些微的感觉
I mean, I-- I feel little moments.

204
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:53,687
不必每次见到我就向我报告
You don't have to give me a status report every time you see me.

205
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,477
虽然你目前已能谈笑风生
Just because you can enjoy yourself and be entertaining

206
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:59,137
但你一周前才刚遭人绑架
doesn't mean you weren't kidnapped a week ago.

207
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:01,057
顺其自然吧
It'll come when it comes.

208
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:02,977
有麦拉蒂的消息吗
Has there been any word of Maladie?

209
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,887
她大概在疗伤中
I imagine she's licking her wounds.

210
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,557
或痛揍伤口
Or punching them.

211
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,937
火焰安妮呢
And Bonfire Annie?

212
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:14,137
听说你昨晚找她加入我们
Heard you were trying to recruit her last night.

213
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,437
- 你好啊  - 你不高兴
Hello, miss. -Amalia: Does that bother you?

214
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:19,807
- 走开  - 我希望你能先告诉我
Get out. -Mary: I wish I'd been told.

215
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,727
万一我突然看见她
If I turned a corner and there she was--

216
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:24,187
我不想无端烦扰你
I didn't want to worry you for nothing.

217
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,767
反正这事也没下文
And nothing is what came of it, so...

218
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,937
你有秘密
You're keeping secrets.

219
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,227
每个女人都有秘密
Every woman keeps secrets.

220
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,727
触能者的秘密又更多了
Every Touched woman keeps a great deal more.

221
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,727
你没正面回答
That's a dodge.

222
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,057
你有什么疑问吗
Was there a question?

223
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:40,387
我问孤儿院的人  这是什么样的地方
I've asked the girls what this place is,

224
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:43,137
为何聚集在这里
and what we're meant to be doing.

225
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:47,017
每个人都有不同答案
And they all have different answers.

226
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:48,637
我能感觉到有些什么
I can sense that there's something--

227
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:53,097
除了互相保护外另有使命
Some sort of mission beyond keeping each other safe.

228
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,097
但有些模糊不清
But it's all a bit vague.

229
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:56,727
你想找出什么
What is it you're looking for?

230
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,727
阴谋还是邪教
A conspiracy? A cult?

231
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,437
- 我又没要你割断脚趾  - 我想找的是你
I'm not asking you to cut off your toes. -I'm looking for you.

232
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:03,347
- 我就在这里  - 是吗
I'm right here. -Are you?

233
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:13,097
三年前 我突然知道了  不该知道的事
Three years ago, I woke up knowing things that I shouldn't,

234
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,637
旁人说我疯了
and was declared insane.

235
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,637
我也曾经以为我疯了
Which for a time, I thought I was.

236
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,437
所以没错  我有秘密没说
So, yes, I keep secrets.

237
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:22,557
我也酗酒  故意跟人打架
I also drink when I shouldn't, fight when I needn't,

238
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:25,347
包括跟不认识的男人
and fuck men whose names I do not learn.

239
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:28,597
我在人群中容易紧张
I get nervous in crowds.

240
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,137
我看见不存在的事物
I see things that aren't there.

241
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:35,557
每次初识人  就想着如何杀死对方
When I meet someone, the first thing I think of is how to kill them.

242
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:39,437
我也有一些优点
I do have some good qualities.

243
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,517
我真心喜欢马
I genuinely like horses.

244
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:47,767
你本来不该知道的事是什么
What is it you know that you shouldn't?

245
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,887
你要我唱歌召唤更多触能者
You want me to sing so that more people will come here?

246
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:00,517
也许我唱不出  是因为不确定他们该来
Maybe I'm struggling because I don't know if they should.

247
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,307
就是现在
Hugo: Yes! Now!

248
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:24,557
快点展现
Tell me!

249
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:29,937
９点４２分１１秒
Nine, forty-two and eleven seconds!

250
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:47,307
紫色的光芒呢
Wh-where's the purple light?

251
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,637
你在说什么
You're supposed to fill the room with light

252
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:50,887
你高潮时应该照亮整个房间
when you spend.

253
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:53,307
我没办法照亮
I don't fill the room--

254
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:57,187
我要的是紫色光  不是格林威治平均时间
I wanted purple light! Not Greenwich Mean Time.

255
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,847
我知道正确时间
Uh, I know the time.

256
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:02,267
没人要雇用触能者了
-No one hires the Touched no more.

257
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:03,977
雨果  抱歉突然闯进来
Hugo, sorry to barge in.

258
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:06,727
我想我们
I just, I think-- I think we're being very, um...

259
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:09,477
奥古  见过多敏妮  她来应征的
Augie, this is Dominique. She's been auditioning.

260
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:12,937
原来如此
Oh. I see. No, I see, I see.

261
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:15,557
祝你好运
Best of luck.

262
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:17,557
你亲自面试所有女性吗
: Do you-- Do you audition all the girls?

263
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,687
还有男性。有一对龙凤胎兄妹
Uh, and the boys. I've got a set of, uh, boy-girl twins

264
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,137
两人间的连结很神奇
who are bonded in the most fascinating way.

265
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:26,307
- 打一人屁股  另一人会  - 雨果
If you spank one of them, the other-- -Oh, Hugo...

266
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,387
我不确定想参与你的生意
I'm just not sure I can be involved with this.

267
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,267
合约已经签好了  老友
It's all signed and sealed, old boy.

268
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,767
你还没寄给公司
But you haven't filed them yet

269
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:34,437
注册处吧
with the-- with the company's house.

270
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,437
- 你一签好就寄出去了  - 当时是凌晨四点啊
Well, the moment they were signed. -What, 4:00 AM?

271
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:39,767
当天寄出去的  你是菲礼曼俱乐部唯一业主
The day they were signed. You are the sole proprietor of the Ferryman's Club,

272
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,727
而且还获利不少
and turning a pretty profit to boot.

273
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,767
- 他是老板  - 一点都没错
He's boss. -He is boss.

274
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,517
获利  这么快吗
Profit? Already?

275
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:48,347
合伙前我已付清一切开销
I paid this all off privately before we started.

276
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:51,347
就是服务人员  招待者
There's just, uh, the staff, the talent, and, uh,

277
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:53,437
以及我们丰厚的薪水
our generous salaries.

278
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,937
- 薪水  - 我知道  很俗气吧
Salaries? -I know. Isn't it common?

279
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,937
我们身旁尽是暴发户
We dwell amongst the nouveau riche.

280
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,267
我跟你面试吧
I audition to you?

281
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:04,517
雨果
Hugo. Hugo! Hugo...

282
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:06,727
- 万一拉薇娜知道了  - 她不会知道
If Lavinia finds out... -She won't.

283
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:07,847
你没投资半毛钱
You haven't invested a penny.

284
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,517
而且合约保密
And the contracts are under seal.

285
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,767
别笑  你得保持神秘
Uh, uh, don't smile. You have mystique.

286
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:14,887
触能者是拉薇娜个人志业
The Touched are her personal cause.

287
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:17,347
- 一旦发现你  - 下位应征者到了
Lavinia, if she finds out what you... -Your next candidate.

288
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,937
- 我们  是你叫他们做这些事  - 付钱请他们做
We... No, you are making them do-- -Paying them to do.

289
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:24,227
- 会付我钱  - 问他住所的事
Paying me to do. -Voice : Ask him... ask him for housing...

290
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:27,137
提供住所给他们  你别吵
And housing them. Quiet, you.

291
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:30,477
- 让他们安身立命  - 雨果  此事非同小可
And keeping them safe. -Hugo, this isn't a schoolyard prank.

292
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:33,767
这里有些行为并不合法
There are things being done here that are illegal.

293
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:35,557
而且可能不道德
And quite, quite possibly immoral.

294
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,807
说到这个  夏绿蒂向你问好
Speaking of which, uh, Charlotte says hello.

295
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:40,347
- 还有露菲玛  - 雨果
Uh, so does Lufima. -Hugo.

296
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,687
- 你该不会  - 帮我拿着
You wouldn't... -There you are.

297
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,387
我那晚的举止
Augie: Wh-wha-what I did that night

298
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,057
确实不合宜
was not the conduct of a gentleman, I know.

299
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:52,137
但并没有违法
But w-- We didn't-- We didn't break any laws.

300
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:55,517
- 据我所知没有  - 法律还管不到你那天干的事
That I know of. -What you did, they don't have laws for.

301
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:57,557
那我就没违法了
Then I didn't break any.

302
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,017
试试看再说
Look, just give it a try.

303
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:02,847
我孤身一人
I'm all alone here, Augie.

304
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,017
无法包办所有事情
I-I can't do all this all by myself.

305
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:06,347
我没时间
I don't have the time.

306
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,517
- ９点４０  - 闭嘴
Nine forty-- -No!

307
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:10,437
一切发生得太快
Everything's just moving much too fast.

308
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,637
抱歉那么快寄出申请
I'm, I'm sorry I filed the papers,

309
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,727
我得用上很多人情  我没办法
but I had to use up a lot of favors, and I can't help--

310
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:18,017
当然有朝一日会放你走  给我一点时间
I-- Of course, I will. I'll-I'll set you free. Just give me time.

311
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,727
同时不如享受一下当老板
And, and meanwhile, enjoy being in charge for a bit,

312
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,637
- 我得去开个会  - 让我当老板吗
'cause I have a meeting. -No-- In charge?

313
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,057
你不需要面试任何人
Well, you don't have to audition anyone. Just...

314
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:29,097
摆个架子就好  一直说＂不行＂  若玛
look important. Say no a lot. Roma!

315
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:32,097
不是说她会发出紫光吗
Where the hell is my purple light?

316
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:34,057
干吗送个怀表来
You sent me a pocket watch.

317
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:37,307
现在立刻把合约送去
: And can you get those fucking contracts filed now?

318
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,387
不行吗
No?

319
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:45,937
小心
Below!

320
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:48,847
罗纳会在您回来前
Mrs. Beechum: Ronald will have those maple branches pruned

321
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,887
修剪好枫树树枝
before you get back.

322
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:53,637
这工会的事应该几天就能解决
This union business should only take a few days.

323
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,597
工会不过是懒人组织
Unions is just organized laziness,

324
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:56,887
请见谅我这么说
if you don't mind my saying.

325
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:59,637
有薪水领和您英明领导  就该感激了
Should be grateful for a wage and your guiding hand.

326
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:00,977
这一团乱是怎么回事
What the hell is all this?

327
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,387
不过装个电话线  又不是高空秋千
We're installing a telephone, not a trapeze.

328
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,057
我会让人清理干净的
I'll make sure they're out of sight.

329
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:06,727
进步所带来的危害
The degradation of progress.

330
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,637
建立家园是为了阻挡外侮
We build homes to keep other people out,

331
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,687
却又造了机器引进外籍劳工
and then build machines to let them all in.

332
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:13,517
去肉铺买东西确实会方便很多
Well, it will help with ordering from the butchers and such.

333
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:16,267
- 加快速度  - 反正现在只用速度
Speed it up. -Yes, because the measure of a thing's worth

334
00:19:16,347 --> 00:19:17,807
来衡量价值
is how quickly it arrives.

335
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,937
若您临时决定回来  或携伴回来
Well, if you was to come unexpectedly, or with company...

336
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:24,267
管家助手听见  您和帕金斯
It's only the under-butler heard you talking to Parkins

337
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,597
谈及一位寡妇
about a widow you'd met.

338
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,187
彼洛夫人的朋友
A friend of Miss Bidlow's.

339
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:32,057
你会开除他吧
You'll fire him yourself?

340
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,477
知道了  老爷
Of course, sir.

341
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:35,597
毕钦太太
And Mrs. Beechum, you will give up

342
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:38,387
别再妄想我续絃
your romantic yen for a mistress.

343
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:42,887
目前家中人丁已是我容忍极限
This house has all the company I can abide.

344
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,477
安妮·卡尔毕
Little Annie Carbey,

345
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,477
莱姆豪斯区的一把火
the Bonfire of Limehouse.

346
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:30,267
从她还是小毛头我就认识了
I've known her since she was a dusky urchin,

347
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:31,557
跟着她父亲去
following her old man around

348
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,767
帮高帽党收保护费
when he collected for the Top Hat Lads.

349
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,687
现在她还有了转变能力
Now, she's got a "turn."

350
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:41,267
可怕的转变能力
A terrible fuckin' "turn."

351
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:45,307
火焰  你们拿什么跟她比
Fire. And what have you got that can compete with that?

352
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:48,687
你们不是有枪吗
You got fucking guns!

353
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,517
大家都看见你们逃跑
People saw you running.

354
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,517
任凭我的货被烧光
By the light of my shipment ablaze,

355
00:20:52,597 --> 00:20:54,847
所有人都看见我乞丐王的手下
people saw the Beggar King's men on the run

356
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,597
打不过一个女孩子
from a fucking girl!

357
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:00,137
欧丁先生
Now, Mr. Odium here

358
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:02,597
想带你们去泰晤士河走走
wanted to take you for a walk along the Thames,

359
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,017
他知道替我办事的人
'cause he knows that when you wear my brand,

360
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,847
就代表我的形象
what you do reflects on me.

361
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:10,767
我又绕回去  但她已经走了
I circled back, but she'd gone.

362
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:12,937
另外两个女子也是
And the other ladies were there.

363
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:15,347
- 哪两个女子  - 寡妇
Other ladies? -The widow.

364
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:17,017
跟会发明的那个
And the science one.

365
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:18,517
她的装备很吓人
She had a horrible device.

366
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:20,517
我不知道她们
Well, I-I didn't know if they were gonna...

367
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:23,137
我会改进的
I'll do better. -Shh, shh, shh,

368
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:31,477
你的烙印还很新
Oh, no. How new that scar is.

369
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:34,637
你只是个新人
No, no. You're a pup!

370
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:40,227
反观
Ha! Now,

371
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:42,807
另一个跟了我八年的人
a man carrying my mark for eight years,

372
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:47,387
还以为他会坚守阵脚
I'd expect him to stand his ground.

373
00:21:47,477 --> 00:21:51,307
也许已经厌倦替我办事
Maybe he's become tired of wearing my mark. Huh?

374
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:56,517
也许我的名号已成了负担
Maybe it's become a burden, my brand.

375
00:21:56,597 --> 00:22:00,017
没人告诉我们会遇上什么
We wasn't told what to expect. -Oh.

376
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:02,017
痛苦和耻辱
Pain and disgrace.

377
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:04,937
没关系
But it's all right.

378
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:07,347
反正你就要遇上了
'Cause you're expecting it. -

379
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:18,937
楚夫人又在打什么鬼主意
So, what the fuck is Mrs. True up to now?

380
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,597
知道这是什么吗
You know about this?

381
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:49,887
有没有人看到是谁放我桌上的
Anyone see who left this?

382
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,437
小心
Below!

383
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,767
试试看阁楼
Mrs. Beechum: Try the attic,

384
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,767
注意东西别太碍眼
and make sure they're out of sight!

385
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:21,477
试试看阁楼
Humph. "Try the attic."

386
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:24,477
别指挥我做事行吗
Try not telling me my business, how about?

387
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,517
别靠近那些狗
Don't go near the dogs. -

388
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:58,387
它们有狂犬病  改走这里
They've gone rabid. Try around here.

389
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,267
听到那人说的吗
Can you believe that man?

390
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:05,887
＂女孩子不要乱玩电器＂
"Electronics is nothing for a girl to be dabbling in."

391
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:08,517
你何时看过我乱玩了  茉朵
Have you ever seen me dabble, Myrtle?

392
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:10,727
看我玩坏他的脸
I'll dabble his face.

393
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,557
楚夫人
Se?ora  True?

394
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:19,437
上面写了什么
What does it say?

395
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:25,727
这不是孤儿院的地址
Penance: That's not our address.

396
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:40,227
你偏好哪一种
Barmaid: What's your preference?

397
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:43,937
这里只卖两种啤酒
We only got two on tap.

398
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:47,767
来杯黑啤酒
A pint of the dark.

399
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,687
你们好
-Ladies.

400
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:01,137
- 柯森医生  见到你真好  - 抱歉  我认识你吗
Dr. Cousens. What a treat. -I'm sorry. Have we met?

401
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,057
当然认识
Oh, yes. As it happens, I promised you

402
00:26:03,137 --> 00:26:04,437
其实我答应过送你一辆马车
your own carriage.

403
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:07,557
车子终于来了
And at last, it's here.

404
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:10,437
想不到你是说真的
Huh. I never thought you meant it.

405
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:13,557
我从不骗人  也未曾吹嘘
Ah, I never lie. I never boast.

406
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:18,097
其实一位富有的病患  正在车里等你
As it happens, a wealthy patient is waiting for you within.

407
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:24,687
你一点儿也不怕这位新病患
A new client, of whom you're not remotely afraid.

408
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,767
闭嘴  上校  别消除他的恐惧
Hush, Colonel. Don't take away his fear.

409
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:29,017
他可能会需要
He might need it.

410
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:39,477
你怕我吗
Are you afraid?

411
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,307
你报答医生的方式人尽皆知
It's well known how you pay your doctors.

412
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:45,137
我好好地答谢过他们的服务了
They were compensated in kind for the services they provided.

413
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:47,687
别对我脑子动手脚就没事
You don't mess about with brains, you're all right.

414
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,187
你知道我为哪些人服务
You know who I work with?

415
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:50,887
人尽皆知乞丐王
Everyone knows the Beggar King

416
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,937
有个妙手回春的医生
has a doctor on call with healing hands.

417
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:58,097
我知道  还有楚夫人
Yes, I know. Mrs. True.

418
00:26:58,187 --> 00:27:01,057
但这跟她无关  而是她留给我的礼物
But this ain't about her. It's about the gift she gave me.

419
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:04,387
万一治好你  怎知你不会
And if I heal you, how do I know you won't--

420
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:07,267
杀了你  就为了向莫莉报仇
What, strike you down to get at Molly?

421
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:10,307
你这么担心
If you're frettin' on that,

422
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:14,597
想必你俩交情匪浅
you two must be... dear friends.

423
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:16,727
或是老交情了
Oh, you do go back a ways.

424
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:18,637
我们都一样
We all do.

425
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,057
只是我不太记得你
Except I don't remember you so well.

426
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:24,597
是有个穿医生袍的黑人
Although there was a Black in a doctor's coat,

427
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:26,597
还以为是我的幻想
which I thought my mind made up.

428
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:28,597
不是
No...

429
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,347
我确实存在
I'm real.

430
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:35,097
让我看看你的伤口
Do you want to show me the wound?

431
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:41,097
当然好  遵命  医生
Yes, sir, doctor, sir.

432
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:46,187
是个顽强的小伤口
It's a persistent little pinhole.

433
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,347
用吻让它好起来
Kiss it better.

434
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:12,017
子弹碎片还在里面
Hmm. Still a bullet fragment in there.

435
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:16,057
得先取出才能治疗伤口
I'll have to take it out before I can help you.

436
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:26,137
会很痛的
This is going to hurt.

437
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:28,187
拜托一定要痛
Promise?

438
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:38,977
那人留下这个
Man gave me this.

439
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:42,307
他叫我等两小时再给你  抱歉
I was told to wait two hours. Sorry.

440
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,557
再来一杯威士忌
And another whiskey.

441
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:48,477
史旺
Frank: Swann.

442
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,557
- 长得还不错  - 还行
Not bad on the eyes. -Yeah, all right, though.

443
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:53,137
希望我们没惹上麻烦
Hope we aren't in trouble.

444
00:29:57,637 --> 00:30:00,227
我有时觉得你故意露出马脚
Sometimes I think you want to get caught.

445
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:03,097
- 女酒保说你在这里  - 是吗
Barmaid told me you were here. -Did she?

446
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:05,307
不可能
Mmm, no, no.

447
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:09,307
她跟我是好知己  我从今天中午就认识她了
She and I are bosom friends. I've known her since half noon.

448
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:11,557
她不会出卖我
She wouldn't squidge on me.

449
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:14,887
总有一天你会落入
One day, you're gonna walk into a place

450
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:17,637
一个你吃不开的地方
that don't think you're charming.

451
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:19,557
而且不稀罕你的臭钱
Don't think your money's charming.

452
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:22,687
- 我的钱可香了  - 你究竟在干吗  史旺
My money is adorable. -What are you doing, Swann?

453
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,937
你整天都在忙什么
What are you spending your day doing

454
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:29,267
自以为是大反派莫里亚蒂  玩些狗屁诡计
with this panto Moriarty crap?

455
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:31,227
你以为工作是这么一回事吗
This what you think a job feels like?

456
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:33,887
我工作可认真了  督察
I'm-- I'm worked to the bone, Inspector.

457
00:30:33,977 --> 00:30:36,557
倒是你没给我半点  楚夫人和孤儿院的
Whilst I've had nothing of worth from you about Amalia True,

458
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:38,057
有用消息
or The Orphanage.

459
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,807
知道安排那次搜索要多少钱吗
Do you know what it cost to arrange that raid?

460
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:42,097
你希望我找到什么
What do you think I'll find, hmm?

461
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:45,937
一堆女孩向往离开安全的社群
A bunch of girls longing to leave the safety of their community

462
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:49,057
- 到你店里卖淫吗  - 有几个也不错
to come whoring for you? -Uh, a few.

463
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:51,387
你有这方面的天份
You do have a talent for it.

464
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:54,017
玛丽·布莱顿呢
What about Mary Brighton?

465
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:56,267
我是问她的转变
Her "turn," I mean.

466
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:58,437
我说过了  是一首歌
I told you. It's a song.

467
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,227
只有触能者听得见
Only the Touched can hear it.

468
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:02,267
会让他们快乐
It makes 'em feel happy.

469
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:05,517
艾梅莉亚楚为一首摇篮曲  冒生命危险
Amalia True risks life and limb for a lullaby.

470
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:10,187
- 不可能只有这样  - 玛丽完全不知道楚夫人的计划
No, there's more. -Mary don't know anything about Mrs. True's plans.

471
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:12,637
玛丽在婚礼当天抛弃你
Mary left you on your wedding day.

472
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:16,057
说她有事会瞒着你并不为过
I think it's safe to say she does keep things from you.

473
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:23,017
当然  她帮了你一把
She did you a favor, of course.

474
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,097
经历如此惨痛失望
Such a dramatic disappointment.

475
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,267
没人会质疑你不愿
No one would question you not rushing to the altar

476
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,687
再踏入婚姻
a second time. -

477
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,477
我常在想
I often wonder,

478
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:37,477
是她知道自己永远无法满足你
did she realize she could never give you what you wanted,

479
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:39,477
还是她发现我可以
or did she find out I was?

480
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:41,557
我当时醉了
I was drunk!

481
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:45,597
我当时喝得烂醉
I was blind drunk.

482
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,977
菲礼曼俱乐部客人络绎不绝
The Ferryman's is a massive venture.

483
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,937
超乎我所预期
More even than I'd hoped.

484
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:56,847
但非做出大规模改变不可
But it depends on an immeasurable level of change.

485
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:58,477
艾梅莉亚·楚
Amalia True?

486
00:31:58,557 --> 00:32:00,137
我才不相信她只想
I do not believe she has any interest

487
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:02,937
给触能者安全庇护  你相信吗
in giving the Touched a safe haven. Do you?

488
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,597
不相信
No.

489
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:09,267
她说能预视未来  但并未全盘托出
Seeing the future... that ain't her whole story.

490
00:32:10,727 --> 00:32:14,687
- 她别有目的  - 现在她把玛丽留在身边
She has a purpose. -And now she has Mary.

491
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,097
为什么
Why? -

492
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:26,267
看看你
Look at you.

493
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,597
躲在暗处还惧怕阴影
A shadow afraid of shadows.

494
00:32:29,437 --> 00:32:31,137
真是孤单寂寞
Such a lonely life.

495
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:33,807
是吗
Yeah?

496
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,687
你的朋友又在哪里
Where are all your friends then?

497
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:46,017
是第一次  法兰克
The first time, Frank. -

498
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:51,437
只有第一次是因为你醉了
You were drunk the first time.

499
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:57,437
我脚趾好痒
My toes itch.

500
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:01,637
剩下的脚趾还是砍断的
The ones you've got, or the ones you haven't?

501
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:03,977
都痒
Both.

502
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:32,637
新月让我变成处女
The new moon has made me a virgin.

503
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:36,387
伤口表面还有点发炎
There's still some infection on the surface. -

504
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:43,307
拿去  一天吃两颗
Here. Take two of these a day,

505
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,017
伤口保持干净
and keep it clean.

506
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,347
这就赎了莫莉的罪过
Is this what Molly's atonement looked like?

507
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,687
这样就够了吗
You think it's enough?

508
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:03,057
我认为你为了她所不能控制的事而责怪她
I think you blame her for something she couldn't control.

509
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:06,347
不晓得到时你会责怪谁
I wonder who you'll blame when the time comes.

510
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,477
你走吧
On you go.

511
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:12,687
叫我走  这可是我的车
Go? This is my carri...

512
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,887
不许抓伤口
Don't scratch at it.

513
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:57,097
威尼马·克鲁  站起来
Winemar Kroos, get up.

514
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:05,807
- 怎么回事  - 闭上臭嘴快走
What's this? -Shut your cunt and come on.

515
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:08,387
放你出去时记得把锁射坏
Shoot up a new lock when they let you out.

516
00:35:09,437 --> 00:35:11,597
你这幸运的王八羔子
You're the luckiest fuck in the world.

517
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:15,387
- 可以把武器还我吗  - 闭嘴
Can I please have my weapon? -Shut it!

518
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:17,387
我需要
I need it!

519
00:35:17,477 --> 00:35:20,187
光天化日张贴在闹市里
Hanging in the market in broad daylight.

520
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,267
看来已经有段时日了
Been out there a while by the state of it.

521
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:24,017
不晓得还有多少张
I have no idea how many more there are.

522
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:25,387
我倒是没看过
Oh, I didn't know about these.

523
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:26,847
我经常外出
I mean, I'm out and about more than most.

524
00:35:26,937 --> 00:35:28,637
照理说应该看过才对
I feel like I should have seen. -Penance: Mmm.

525
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,557
现在你看到了  我们亲自登门拜访
You can see now. Time for a visit.

526
00:35:30,637 --> 00:35:33,727
我俩很久没一块儿出门玩了
Been long since you and I did a proper ladies' out, isn't it?

527
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,597
说得没错
It has, as that.

528
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:01,387
来了
Yes! Yes, I'm coming!

529
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,187
你们是谁
Who are you?

530
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,267
你们来这里干吗
What on Earth is this all about?

531
00:36:39,017 --> 00:36:41,137
我的妈呀  他可真丑
Fuck a drumstick, he's ugly.

532
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:43,637
他是来抓茉朵的人之一吗
Is this one of those guys what come after Myrtle?

533
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:45,477
没错
Amalia: He was.

534
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,057
这是什么
Lucy: What is it?

535
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:56,267
你先把帅哥跟老太婆带回孤儿院
Get handsome to The Orphanage and take grandmother with you.

536
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,937
- 需要车资吗  - 不用  我有钱
You need fare? -No, no, no, no. I've got money.

537
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,017
不是偷来的
It's not from stealing.

538
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:04,187
得查出他们做了些什么
We need to know everything that they've been doing.

539
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:06,267
黛瑟蕾会让他们招来
Ah, Désirée will get it out of her.

540
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:08,267
不然就由我动手
Or I will.

541
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:11,137
潘妮丝还在测试那个玩意儿吗
Is Penance still doing her what's-it test?

542
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:15,977
对  得在玛丽开口唱前让一切就绪
Yes. We need to be set up the day Mary is ready to sing.

543
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:19,227
我傍晚直接去公园和潘妮丝会合
I'll meet Penance in the park at dusk.

544
00:37:19,307 --> 00:37:21,227
你上哪儿去
Where are you going?

545
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:24,969
拿这些去给彼洛夫人看
Miss Bidlow needs to see this.

546
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:31,759
法兰克
Frank.

547
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,429
我
Hi. -I, uh...

548
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:35,589
我没有要你赶过来的意思
I, um, didn't mean for you to rush over.

549
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,089
不想浪费你的时间
I don't want to waste your time.

550
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:40,589
我有足够人手  没关系
Oh, no, I've got other people doing that, thanks.

551
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,839
- 你该不会  - 不是的
But you're not in any... -No, no, no.

552
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:45,299
不是什么大事
No. Noth-- nothing dire. Just, um...

553
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:48,429
我想麦拉蒂应该还没落网
Well, I... I, I don't suppose that Maladie's been, um,

554
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:51,879
被遣往澳洲吧
oh, you know, captured and sent off to Australia.

555
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,129
发生什么事了吗
Did, did something happen?

556
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,759
楚夫人有什么计划吗
Is-is Mrs. True up to something?

557
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,839
尽管告诉我  不会列入纪录的
I mean, you, you can tell me. It's unofficial, of course.

558
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:07,719
不是  只是情况比我预期的还要奇怪
No. It's just stranger than I expected,

559
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,839
跟一群触能者住在一起
you know, being around so many of the Touched. It's...

560
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,759
我的
My, my...

561
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,679
歌曾经只属于自己
my song used to be mine. It was like a little...

562
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:16,879
能抚慰我的心灵
little piece of comfort.

563
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:20,799
现在公诸于世了
But then, now that I've gone public, it just...

564
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,969
我不知道
I don't...

565
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:26,629
要如何
I don't know how to find that...

566
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,679
找回歌声
voice that I have. -Uh...

567
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:36,549
我可以帮你另找住处
I could-- I could-- I could find you a place.

568
00:38:36,629 --> 00:38:38,929
再不然的话
You know I've got that, the spare room,

569
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:41,799
我家也有空房间
if there, there's nothing else.

570
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:45,259
- 我不会对你  - 我知道
And I, I wouldn't try to-- -No, it's...

571
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:48,049
我知道你不会
I know you wouldn't.

572
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:51,129
法兰克  我不是那个意思
I, I-- Frank, I didn't mean it-- it's, uh...

573
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,089
我知道你是绅士  所以不会逾矩
As, as a gentleman, I know that you wouldn't.

574
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:58,259
但以身为男人的角度也一样
But also as a man who...

575
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,759
法兰克
Frank...

576
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:03,299
你是好人
You're a good man.

577
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:07,129
但是你憎恨自己某个部分
But there's a part of you that you hate.

578
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,839
我不会多说
I, I won-- I won't say any more.

579
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,799
只想告诉你
Except that...

580
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:15,429
我永远不会恨你
I will never hate you.

581
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:21,219
不会因你的本性而恨你
Not for who you are.

582
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:25,839
你永远是我有麻烦时会找的人
You'll always be the man that I call when there's trouble,

583
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,929
没有麻烦时也一样
and when there's not trouble, I guess.

584
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:38,799
- 可以拜托你一件事吗  - 当然
Can I ask you for something? -Of course.

585
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,929
你下次唱歌时
N-next time you sing,

586
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:44,839
不是一般的那种
not that, that kind of singing...

587
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,759
我也想在场
I-I'd like to be there.

588
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:51,719
你知道只有触能者听得到吧
You know that only the Touched can hear it.

589
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:53,379
我只是想
Yeah, I want to feel like,

590
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:56,469
至少可以试试看
'cause at least just give it a go.

591
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:01,089
人都会改变
People change.

592
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,969
最糟也不过就是用看的
At the worst, I'll watch.

593
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:11,799
我很久没看你登台唱歌了
It's been a long while since I've seen you on a stage.

594
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:22,589
已经安排就绪了  我们
Arrangements have already been made, and we, uh--

595
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,929
- 抱歉没等你来就开始  - 无妨
Forgive us, we have to begin. -Of course, of course.

596
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:26,929
我从电话里已大概明白了
I got the gist on my telephone.

597
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:30,509
我们对投资报酬抱有多大信心
What are the confidence levels on the investment's return?

598
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:34,929
很遗憾地  我们无法预视未来
Regrettably, we are among those who cannot see into the future.

599
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:37,759
但我们对局势一清二楚
But we do have a clearer view of the field.

600
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,799
看来新加入者开始动作了
It appears the new players are in motion.

601
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:46,259
得把那些传单撕下来
We need to get those fliers taken down.

602
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:48,049
- 也许已传遍全伦敦  - 别拿下来
They could be all over London. -Leave them.

603
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,759
我会派人看着那栋房子  以防有人找上门
I'll have someone watch the house in case anyone turns up,

604
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,429
不论知情或不知情者
innocent or otherwise.

605
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:55,719
- 我可以做些什么  - 我要知道那栋房子主人是谁
What can I do? -I need to know who owns the building.

606
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:57,969
我这一两天就能查出
I can get that information for you in a day or so.

607
00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:00,129
但我认为帮助不大
Although I doubt it will reveal much.

608
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:01,969
玛丽·布莱顿怎么样了
What about Mary Brighton?

609
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:05,629
她发得出  召唤声吗
Is she doing her siren call, or what have you?

610
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,129
我不确定  她一直力不从心
Amalia: I'm not sure. She's been struggling.

611
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:11,759
我们今晚会在公园测试
We're doing the test this evening, in the park.

612
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,049
若玛丽唱得出来  我们会让所有触能者听见
If Mary can find her voice, we'll make sure it's heard.

613
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:18,719
你跟她们说了什么
Distorted voice: What did you tell them?

614
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:21,549
什么
What...

615
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,549
什么
What? What--

616
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,660
我什么都没说
N-nothing. I-I never said--

617
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,910
- 跟她们说了什么  - 我发誓
What did you tell them?! -I, I, I, s-swear.

618
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:33,469
什么也没说
I, I didn't tell anyone anything.

619
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:34,839
我没有
I didn't!

620
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:37,469
你已情绪高涨
Désirée: Well, now that your blood is up,

621
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:40,879
可以开始了
how's about we start then? -

622
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,339
你们是谁
Who are all you people?

623
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:51,549
我们是看传单找上你的人
We're the people who answer your flier.

624
00:41:51,629 --> 00:41:53,719
我不会回答你们的问题
Well, I'm not answering any of your questions.

625
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,549
你替谁工作
Who do you work for?

626
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:58,299
一个男人  很高  穿毛皮大衣
A man. Tall. Had a fur coat.

627
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:00,679
说话得体但不至太高贵
Well-spoken but not too posh.

628
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:03,759
你以为老板本人会抛头露面吗
You think they'd send the boss around, showin' his face?

629
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,679
他们把那些女孩怎么了
What do they do to the girls?

630
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:07,379
我想是做实验吧
Experiments, I think.

631
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:13,469
- 为何选上你  - 大概知道了我不堪的过去
Why you? -They knowed about my tragedy, I guess.

632
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:15,629
关于我女儿受的折磨
About my daughter, and all the suffering.

633
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,879
你听见任何名字吗
Did you hear a name?

634
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:19,219
水  她能把所有东西变成水
Water. She made everything water.

635
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:22,259
任何液体都行  她把酒变成水
Any liquid. She did it with wine,

636
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,799
跟耶稣做的相反
which is the opposite of Jesus.

637
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,759
那酒可是花了我二先令
Plus, it cost me two shillings.

638
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:29,879
有一口井水让人喝了生病
There was a well, made everyone sick.

639
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:31,679
她处理好了
She fixed that,

640
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:34,469
但这不是一般人该做的事
but that's not for a person to do.

641
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:36,049
但她从不曾害怕
But she was never afraid of it.

642
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:37,379
她什么都不怕
She stopped being afraid of anything.

643
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:40,219
她总说  ＂水即生命＂
She would just say, "Water is life."

644
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:43,469
到了晚上她坐着做针线活
Sitting up nights with her needlework,

645
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:45,679
她知道一些事
just knowing something.

646
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:48,469
坐在那里  知道些什么
Sitting and knowing.

647
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:51,259
有个年轻人也看见了  那样不正常
A young man saw it, too. It was unnatural.

648
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:55,429
我心里祈求卸下她身上的重担
My heart bleeding for the burden

649
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:58,179
我身上的重担
on, uh, on, on me.

650
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:02,429
有天她去洗澡
And she went for a bath.

651
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:06,509
真的好难  好难
And it was so hard. It was so hard to...

652
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:11,879
把她压在水里  因为她不懂是怎么回事
hold her down like that 'cause she didn't understand.

653
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:16,299
她拍着水挣扎
She was splashing and struggling

654
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:18,089
想要叫救命
and trying to cry out.

655
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,679
我看得一清二楚  因为她把水变得清澈
I could see it all 'cause she made the water so clear.

656
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,969
我必须忍受
I had to bear that.

657
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:27,608
我必须坚强
I had to be strong...

658
00:43:28,803 --> 00:43:30,272
直到她停止挣扎
till she stopped.

659
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:33,209
直到她终于自由
Till she was free.

660
00:43:34,037 --> 00:43:36,469
她与肚子里的孩子
Her and the child inside her.

661
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:38,179
露西
-Lucy!

662
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:40,129
放开我
Let go of me!

663
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:43,089
露西
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

664
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:48,049
人神共愤  你们的存在人神共愤
Abominations! Abominations, all of you!

665
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:49,799
你们得
-You need to--

666
00:43:58,259 --> 00:44:00,679
露西的转变来得很突然
Lucy's "turn" came sudden.

667
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:03,839
她不知道自己是触能者
She didn't know she was Touched

668
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:07,129
直到她从摇篮抱起儿子
till she lifted her baby boy up from his bassinet.

669
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:10,759
才六个月大  也是第一个  回应她的爱的人
Six months old and the first person to ever love her back.

670
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:16,549
他连哭都来不及就粉身碎骨
And all his bones broke before he could even make a sound.
