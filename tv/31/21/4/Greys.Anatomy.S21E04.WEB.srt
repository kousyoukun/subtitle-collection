1
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:10,367
<i>Before we operate,</i>

2
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:12,468
<i>we place drapes</i>
<i>over our patient,</i>

3
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,905
<i>exposing only the area</i>
<i>where we'll be working.</i>

4
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,510
<i>They not only help us focus</i>
<i>on what we need to see,</i>

5
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:23,646
<i>but they keep the field clean</i>

6
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:25,447
<i>and minimize debris</i>
<i>getting in the way.</i>

7
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:28,118
Incoming!
And I don't have a lot of time.

8
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,986
Do you want to use one of our
other three bathrooms to vomit?

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,922
Shh!

10
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,257
I feel decent for the first
time in weeks, so don't jinx it.

11
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:36,326
Oh, and don't forget we have
our first OB appointment today.

12
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,761
I thought
that was after work.
It is.

13
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:40,931
So what's the rush?
Well, the kids
are still asleep,

14
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:43,033
my charts are done,

15
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,969
and I've got just enough time
for a quick shower.

16
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:49,705
How quick?

17
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:52,608
If it's too quick,
I'll kill you.

18
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:57,646
<i>Drapes are specialized to fit</i>
<i>the needs of various surgeries.</i>

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,349
<i>The challenge comes</i>

20
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,017
<i>when there's a complication</i>
<i>under the drape.</i>

21
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:02,818
Oh, and we switched
to a new EMR.

22
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:05,956
Now you select
the medication on top

23
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,623
and then scroll all the way down
to enter the dosage.

24
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:09,159
Makes no sense.

25
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:10,826
Medication up top.
Dosage on the bottom. Got it.

26
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:13,430
And you only allowed
two pairs of scrubs now.

27
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:14,697
It's all automated.

28
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,532
Miranda,
I've been a resident before.

29
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:17,968
I'll be okay.
You're not nervous?

30
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:20,170
No, I feel great.
It's like coming home.

31
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:21,837
Dr. Bailey, welcome back.

32
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:23,539
Yeah, welcome back
to the both of you.

33
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:26,809
Oh, Warren, do --
do you know a Dr. Ndugu?

34
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:28,610
Are you kidding? I tore up
the dance floor at his wedding.

35
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:29,812
My moves were
basically a meme.

36
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:31,580
I was like, "uh, uh!"

37
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:32,781
How's Catherine?

38
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,783
Oh, feeling better
every day,

39
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:36,453
especially now that we know the
biopsy results were negative.

40
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,421
Thank God.
She wants to throw a party.

41
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:40,789
Caviar and champagne,

42
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:42,459
and not the kind you get
from your regular grocery store.

43
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:44,693
Well, I'd expect no less.
Send her our best.

44
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:46,363
-Will do.
-Okay.

45
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:48,764
This...
means stop talking.

46
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:51,101
What?
Ndugu and Pierce
are getting a divorce.

47
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:52,501
-Oh.
-Aw.

48
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,038
<i>When the body's draped,</i>

49
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,606
<i>we can't see something going</i>
<i>pale or a leg turning blue.</i>

50
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,176
I refuse to be late
on Bailey's first day back.

51
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,112
Tell that to the guy who took
a 20-minute shower.

52
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,612
Says the guy
who doesn't live there.

53
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,647
Hey. There was a fistfight
on my bus.

54
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,283
I thought I was gonna
be late.

55
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,452
Hey.
Where's your sister?

56
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:11,520
We want to meet
your mini-Mika.

57
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,656
Late, and we're not
alike at all.

58
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,525
<i>When we can't see</i>
<i>the whole body,</i>

59
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,861
<i>we might miss a telltale sign</i>
<i>something's gone wrong.</i>

60
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:20,729
Thank you.

61
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,937
Sorry.
I left my phone on the plane,

62
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:29,538
and the line for the bathroom
was really long,

63
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:32,475
and then Dumbledore missed
the freeway exit.

64
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,010
My rideshare driver looked
just like him.

65
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:35,644
I couldn't see it.

66
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:37,414
Yep.
Not alike at all.

67
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,648
That's Lucas,
a.k.a. Skywalker,

68
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:42,785
Simone, Blue, and, uh, Jules.

69
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,421
Hi.

70
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:46,456
This is my youngest sister,
Chloe.

71
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,459
I have cancer.

72
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,094
Don't be late for Bailey.

73
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,828
We'll see you later.

74
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,701
Come here.
It's gonna be okay.

75
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:01,371
Dr. Webber is the best.

76
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,474
We'll figure this out.

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,309
Come on.

78
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:07,477
Huh?

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,915
Here is
the overnight roster list.

80
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,317
You need to follow up
on Ms. Borgman's CT,

81
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:17,087
and there are two rule-out
appy consults in the ER

82
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,787
waiting for ultrasounds.

83
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,756
Good morning to you, too.

84
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,292
Not all of us
just spent two weeks in Paris.

85
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:24,961
Clearly. Mm.

86
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,529
This is nothing like
a café crème.

87
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:28,198
Will you just take this
so I can go home

88
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,966
and face plant
onto my pillow?

89
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,168
Morning.
Good morning.

90
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:35,604
I mean, uh, hi.
I -- Hey.

91
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:39,309
This is James,
the hospital chaplain.

92
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:40,742
<i>Enchanté.</i>

93
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:43,413
Taryn.

94
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,915
You work nights?
I work when I'm needed.

95
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,584
Is that from
the coffee cart?

96
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,352
Oh, no.
I drink French now.

97
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:50,954
It's, uh, Le Gateau Jolie
down the street.

98
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:54,157
Okay.

99
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,092
I could use
some coffee.

100
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:57,860
Would you want
to go for a walk?

101
00:03:57,994 --> 00:04:00,696
<i>Oui.</i>
Oh! That's French
for "yes."

102
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:03,433
Nice to meet you.

103
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:08,972
Welcome back, boy.

104
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:12,041
So Bailey's her husband's boss.
Is that allowed?

105
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,910
Oh, one of your aunts
is head of the neuro department,

106
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:15,345
and your other aunt's name
is on the building.

107
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:16,412
Heron hired him
before she left.

108
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,614
Everyone says
he's impressive.

109
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:19,082
Bring it.
You all slow me down.

110
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:20,617
Oh, my God.
He's not your competition.

111
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:22,352
He's a fourth year
on a trial basis

112
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:23,752
until the ACGME
approves him to stay.

113
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:24,988
Well, there's a finite number
of people

114
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:27,290
who can fit around
an operating table.

115
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,659
Everyone is my competition,
including Mr. Dr. Bailey.

116
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,963
Uh, it's Warren, actually.
Ben Warren.

117
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:36,865
Looking forward to working
with you again, Dr. Kwan.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,101
I see you've met
Dr. Warren.

119
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,868
Yes, he is my husband.

120
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,670
No, he will not be getting
special treatment.

121
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,672
As for the rest of you,

122
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:47,610
any bad habits you picked up
while I was gone -- lose them.

123
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,079
You have four months left
in your intern year.

124
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,748
I want you sprinting
to that finish line.

125
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,517
Understood?

126
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,286
All right.
Helm has your assignments.

127
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,455
Any problems, she'll be happy
to hear about it.

128
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,357
Get to work.

129
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:05,328
Okay, Griffith is with Ndugu.
Warren and Kwan, to the pit.

130
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:07,397
Adams and Millin with me.

131
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:10,466
Ah.
Oh.

132
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:14,671
<i>Dr. Agana to PEDS ICU.</i>

133
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:16,940
<i>Dr. Rachel Agana...</i>

134
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,475
100 unread e-mails
after operating all night.

135
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:21,477
Why do I like this job again?

136
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,246
Were you in the OR?
Yeah.

137
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,846
Nasty bus accident
at the airport.

138
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:26,149
I was called in around 4:00.
Kids are at my mom's.

139
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:28,952
Oh, no.
Why didn't you call me?

140
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:31,187
I didn't want to disturb you
while you were in surgery.

141
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,289
What's wrong?
I had muffins and bagels
delivered to the house

142
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:34,958
because you've been
on the morning routine so often,

143
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,292
I wanted to take care
of breakfast for you.

144
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:37,527
You should have
said something.

145
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,861
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

146
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:40,964
Do you think that your mom could
go over there and grab them?

147
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:42,932
I am in
back-to-back meetings,

148
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:43,967
and Richard wants
the quarterly budget report

149
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,301
before it goes
to the board.

150
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:46,768
Sounds like
you need a break.

151
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,705
That is the opposite
of what I need.

152
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,307
Trust me. I had your job.
You have to pace yourself.

153
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,243
This job is very different
than the job

154
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:56,512
you had 10 years ago,
but, um, thanks for the tip.

155
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:58,681
I'm just trying to help.

156
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:01,584
I have to go fire
an anesthesiologist.
Okay.

157
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,622
Uh, you said
we'd be saving lives.

158
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:08,358
I said you'd be helping
to save lives.

159
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:11,594
You are contributing to one of
the most memorable experiences

160
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,862
in a medical student's
education,

161
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:16,366
providing the opportunity
to learn human anatomy

162
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,533
while developing
their own understanding

163
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,435
of what it means
to be human.

164
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,837
Uh, are those...
I hate this already.

165
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:24,574
Cadavers for Ander-Simmons's
med school anatomy lab.

166
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:26,609
We scan them
so students have images

167
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:29,145
to help them diagnose
how their cadavers died

168
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,114
during their anatomy-class
dissection.

169
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,782
Good luck.
Uh, you're
not helping?

170
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,551
<i>Ce n'est pas</i>
<i>la mer à boire.</i>

171
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:38,688
Pretty sure that means
"we're screwed."

172
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,329
<i>Dr. Karascos to PEDS.</i>

173
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:48,765
<i>Dr. Vivianne Karascos to PEDS.</i>

174
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,500
Dr. Ndugu.

175
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,369
Am I getting out of here
today?

176
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:55,938
This pneumonia's taking up
all of my field time.

177
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,441
I supposed to be out
blocking the half-time show.

178
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:00,510
Mr. Riley's a high school
band director.

179
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:02,844
You win the state championship
three times in a row?

180
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:06,015
Oh, come on, don't take
the fourth one away from me.

181
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,319
All right, well, we'll make
this quick so you can
get back to it, all right?

182
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:12,622
Dr. Griffith.
Darren Riley, 55,
history of smoking

183
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,657
and pulmonary fibrosis,
admitted for

184
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,993
multi-drug-resistant
gram negative pneumonia,

185
00:07:17,126 --> 00:07:19,696
currently on seven liters
nasal cannula and Vanc-Zosyn.

186
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,498
Oh, there's music in the voice.
You sing?

187
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,267
No, but I marched
in high school.

188
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,269
Birds of a feather.

189
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,103
Which instrument?

190
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:28,504
Trombone.

191
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,973
Oh, former 'bone player
and a doctor.

192
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:33,643
That's not bad.
It's not.

193
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:35,578
SATs are low,
despite the nasal cannula.

194
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:37,013
Okay, uh, let's put him
on high flow

195
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:39,315
and then get him to CT.

196
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,684
Dr. Griffith's gonna take you
for some scans.
More scans?

197
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:44,153
We're doing everything we can
to get you out of here, okay?

198
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,490
Stay close.
No local family,

199
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:49,425
and his last ABG came back
borderline.

200
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,632
I reviewed your scans
with radiology.

201
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:59,868
There is some
suspicious-appearing
lymph nodes.

202
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:03,306
It's likely stage 3B
rectal cancer due to --

203
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,708
Wait. 3B?
I thought it was 2A.

204
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:08,511
Mimi, can you just
stop moving?

205
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:11,280
Sorry.

206
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:13,683
Okay.
Uh, what happens next?

207
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:15,318
Chemotherapy?
Radiation?

208
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,520
Correct.
Mm, surgery is a possibility,

209
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:19,288
depending on
the tumor's response.

210
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:22,592
Will I lose my hair?
It's possible.

211
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,093
What other side effects
are there?

212
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,429
Oh, it varies from patient
to patient.

213
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:29,665
Radiation often causes
impaired ovarian function.

214
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,801
There is nausea and fatigue,

215
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:34,604
and changes in mood
and weight are common, too.

216
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:37,507
I won't be able
to have kids?

217
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,178
We'll have you talk to
an OB/GYN about your options.

218
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,914
Do you have any other questions
for me?

219
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:46,582
How long does
chemo usually take?

220
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,638
Wait. So you went
from Wyoming to Raleigh

221
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:11,340
to St. Louis to Seattle?

222
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,042
There were a bunch of places
in between.

223
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:15,611
I-I did the whole global-nomad
thing before divinity school.

224
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:17,013
I've only ever lived here.

225
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,917
But you travel, right?

226
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:23,953
Well, I used to visit
my grandparents in Illinois.

227
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:26,189
Well, but then how did you
end up becoming a chaplain?

228
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:30,293
I grew up in Wyoming with two
devout Episcopal parents.

229
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:34,363
I-I love them,
but it was, uh, complicated.

230
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:37,200
Was it like a -- like a hard
coming-out thing or...?

231
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,170
No, not really.
Um, I'm an only child,

232
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:44,607
and I always felt this pressure
to be their everything.

233
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,444
And, uh, I don't know,
I needed space.

234
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:51,247
So left home,
never looked back.

235
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,150
And then they died.

236
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,152
I'm so sorry.

237
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:58,788
Yeah, I wish I had a more noble
reason for becoming a chaplain.

238
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:01,657
But truth is, I only
really found my faith again

239
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,827
because of grief, guilt.

240
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:06,128
Sometimes you have to
help yourself

241
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:08,631
in order to help others.

242
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,099
That's very poetic.

243
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,168
That's my mother.

244
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,171
She's a whole other
conversation.

245
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:16,806
You know, I have time.

246
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,575
Wanna get lunch?

247
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,744
Yeah.

248
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:23,246
I called up CT.

249
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,780
They know we'll be there
in two minutes.

250
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,850
They told us to come in
in Trauma One.

251
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:29,987
Warren,
nice to see you back

252
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,320
on this side
of the ambulance bay.

253
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,256
On a trial basis for now.
You back full time?

254
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,625
But don't go easy.
I'm just another resident.

255
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,660
Well, uh, why don't you warm up
with some sutures?

256
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:40,263
We have a small thigh lac
in bed three.

257
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,631
I just gave her some lido.

258
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:43,599
And Kwan,
you can help him out.

259
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,937
After you.

260
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,540
Uh, Ms. Dunn.

261
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:52,808
I'm Dr. Warren,
and this is Dr. Kwan.

262
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,777
Judith is fine.
Not Judy.

263
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,947
Judy is my mother,
and she talks to her plants.

264
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,481
Judith it is.

265
00:10:58,614 --> 00:10:59,983
So it says here you have
a cut on your thigh.

266
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,584
Let's take a look.
Roll over, please.

267
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:04,787
Okay.

268
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:11,460
Okay. Uh...

269
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:13,030
It's my own
dumb fault.
Oh.

270
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:17,199
Six-inch stilettos and tequila
don't mix.

271
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,135
Oh.
What was the occasion?

272
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:21,170
The tequila was
for my friend's birthday.

273
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:23,539
The heels were
for my new peach.

274
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,475
I got a BBL
two months ago --

275
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,344
a Brazilian butt lift.

276
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:30,279
Oh.
We're familiar.

277
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,616
Careful, Doctor.

278
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:35,685
All that drool
could stain your white coat.

279
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,486
No, no, no, it's, um --
it's not what you think.

280
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,156
Um, I grabbed
the wrong sutures.

281
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:42,592
Can you grab me
a 4-oh-monocryl?

282
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,662
Uh, I was just getting
a better future for your cut.

283
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,497
How are you feeling?
You need more lidocaine?

284
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,366
I don't feel the cut
anymore, but, ugh,

285
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:53,336
it's my hip
that's killing me.
From the fall?

286
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:54,837
I finally feel well enough to
take this booty out for a spin,

287
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:56,706
and now my hip's hurting
like hell.

288
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,307
Ah, it's probably
just bruising,

289
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,843
but we'll get some labs
and X-rays just to be safe.

290
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:02,678
Can you grab the labs and
I'll take care of the X-rays?

291
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,246
You got it, boss.

292
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:11,787
Oh!

293
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,589
Oh, why is it that everybody
who donates their body

294
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:15,424
to science weighs
like 800 pounds?

295
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,159
They don't. They just can't
change their center of gravity

296
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:19,528
like live people.
They're literally dead weight.

297
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:20,630
Okay. Can you -- Can you hold
your side up more?

298
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:21,797
I am.
He's sagging.

299
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,299
I don't think he cares.

300
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:25,068
Oh!

301
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:29,973
Well, the good news is, uh,
we only have 29 left of these.

302
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:31,474
What's the bad news?

303
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:35,912
He's on feet first.

304
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,793
Uh, Griffith?

305
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,328
How busy are you?

306
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:54,797
I'm almost done inputting orders
for Dr. Ndugu.

307
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:57,934
And then I should start rounds
in about 20 minutes.

308
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,202
Oh, uh, just enough time
to run to the pit.

309
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:01,837
You need something there?

310
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:04,908
There are a couple of patients
on Dr. Hunt's service.

311
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:06,442
Can you check on them
for me?

312
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:08,244
You need me to add someone
to my roster list?

313
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:11,614
Oh, no. No. Uh, just see
how things are going.

314
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,482
Like, check and see
if the patients

315
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,618
are satisfied
with their care here?

316
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,088
Um, you don't need to <i>say</i>
anything to them.

317
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,791
Just discreetly observe.

318
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:25,028
See how the patients
are doing.

319
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:29,799
See how the doctors...
are doing.

320
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:34,303
Got it. And then I should
circle back with you after.

321
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:35,738
Took the words right out
of my mouth.

322
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,678
We typically recommend
hormone-replacement therapy

323
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:46,282
for the loss of estrogen
production and fertility.

324
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:49,019
So that would allow me
to have kids later if I want.

325
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,653
Well, there's no guarantees,

326
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,923
<i>but i</i> f you want to increase
your chances,

327
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:55,591
many patients opt to retrieve
and freeze their eggs.

328
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,326
What do you think?

329
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,661
Uh, It'll take
at least a month

330
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,931
to do a round
of egg retrieval.

331
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:03,766
That's if your body responds
to the hormones correctly.

332
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,368
The cancer could spread to
a later stage during that time.

333
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:09,005
There are other options,
right?

334
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,508
At this time, egg freezing is
the most effective and common.

335
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,577
Okay.
Find something else.

336
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,345
Look at other
colorectal cancer cases.

337
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,313
Meet with your department.
Yasuda...

338
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:19,082
There has to be a way.

339
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,750
It's okay, Mimi.

340
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:22,585
I'm not sure I really
want kids anyway.

341
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:28,758
Warren,
nice to see you back.

342
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:30,526
What do we got?

343
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,695
Uh, 34-year-old female,
history of type-two diabetes.

344
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,463
Tripped and fell onto
her left thigh three days ago.

345
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:37,000
Sustained
a thigh laceration,

346
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:39,502
but has pain with weight bearing
that's getting more severe.

347
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,504
How are her labs?
Still waiting.

348
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:43,672
I just called
to put a rush on it.

349
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,142
You think it's
a hip joint effusion?

350
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:46,709
I couldn't tell you.
This is a lateral hip.

351
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,611
I need an AP view.

352
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:51,514
I-I don't know what happened.
I ordered an X-ray series.

353
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,816
Oh, the system is
a little funky.

354
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,986
You gotta go to the dropdown
to order the AP view.
Oh.

355
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,654
Hip joint effusions are
difficult to see on X-rays.

356
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,091
A CT scan would give
better visibility.

357
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:03,260
Kwan's right.
Page us when you've got it.

358
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:04,460
Mm.

359
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:05,661
You want me
to show you how --

360
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:07,296
No, I-I got it.
I got it.

361
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,469
-Oh!
-Oh!

362
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,337
-Whoa!
-Oh.

363
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:19,809
Are you okay?

364
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:21,978
Chloe's cancer is
more advanced than we thought.

365
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm so sorry.

366
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,581
Webber asked Dr. Sugihara
to see her.

367
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,817
Chief of Oncology.
That's good.
It's terrible.

368
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:29,819
She has to start chemo
and radiation right away,

369
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:32,255
which means she doesn't have
time to protect her fertility.

370
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,991
Oh.
Does she <i>want</i> kids?

371
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,693
She's 22.

372
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,462
She doesn't know what she wants
for breakfast tomorrow.

373
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:43,599
She's the eighth
out of eight sisters.

374
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,101
She spent her whole life

375
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,603
getting dragged
to our practices, our recitals.

376
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,772
She only ever had
hand-me-downs.

377
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,440
Always had to watch us
on the roller coasters

378
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:53,742
because she wasn't
tall enough.

379
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,511
And now that she's <i>finally</i>
out of our shadows

380
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:58,414
and starting to live
her own life...

381
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:00,482
this.

382
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:02,418
Her future should be
wide open,

383
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:05,454
not limited
by an awful disease.

384
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:07,958
Well, at least
she'll still be alive.

385
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:09,960
What is <i>that</i>
supposed to mean?

386
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,661
Nothing. I'm just trying
to look on the bright side.

387
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:15,531
My sister has cancer.
There is no bright side.

388
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:16,632
But you wouldn't get that,
would you?

389
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,500
Because you don't
have sisters.

390
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:20,636
You have one brother who thinks
celery juice changes lives,

391
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,671
and you don't even
like him.

392
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,707
So please don't pretend to
understand what this feels like.

393
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,442
You never will.

394
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:41,624
No. No way. You're living
in complete fantasy.

395
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,094
You asked my opinion.

396
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,262
Well, I wasn't expecting
it to be wrong.

397
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:46,963
I am a man of science.

398
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:48,965
I don't know what else
to tell you.

399
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,267
The <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
can go faster than light.

400
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,533
It has hyperdrive.

401
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,336
That thing breaks down
more often

402
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:54,971
than my mom's
old Ford Taurus.

403
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:56,705
It made the Kessel Run
in under 12 parsecs.

404
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,643
The Kessel Run
tests navigation, not speed.

405
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,745
The <i>Enterprise</i> is
exponentially faster.

406
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,282
How do you figure?
Warp 1 is
the speed of light.

407
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:06,983
Even the original <i>Enterprise</i>
went up to Warp 5.

408
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,752
Who are you?
So you would rather be
the captain

409
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,988
of the <i>Enterprise</i>
than Han Solo?

410
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,023
Obviously.

411
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:14,090
Do you want to go back
to my place?

412
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,926
Obviously.

413
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,253
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

414
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:44,921
I thought you were
on cardio today.

415
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,990
I am. I had to run
downstairs for something.

416
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:49,993
Well, I'm, uh...

417
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,527
glad I got to see you.

418
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,929
Mm.

419
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:58,168
Hi.

420
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,909
Can I ask you
a hypothetical question?
Yeah.

421
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,477
If you were asked to review
a colleague's performance

422
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,813
and they made
an inconsequential mistake,

423
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:12,614
would you mention it?

424
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,650
Are we getting
peer reviewed?

425
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,753
No, more of
a informal observation.

426
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:19,588
Will they get in trouble?
I don't think so.

427
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:23,492
Okay, so, uh,
nothing major went wrong,

428
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,494
and there are
no consequences.

429
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:26,963
I think you
answered my question.

430
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:31,700
How's your project
with Helm?

431
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:34,870
Is it something fun?
Deathly boring?

432
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,206
Definitely the latter.

433
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:38,441
Mm.

434
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,416
Your sister went outside
to get some air

435
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:47,816
and call your parents.

436
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,021
Oh.

437
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:54,190
Colorectal cancer
and fertility studies.

438
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,992
Just educating myself.

439
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,460
I know you want things
to be better for Chloe.

440
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,129
She's my sister.

441
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,530
And you're also a surgeon.

442
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:04,867
We like to believe we can solve
everyone's problems.

443
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:06,036
I really thought
there'd be other options,

444
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,704
but Wilson's right.

445
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:11,007
You know...

446
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:16,312
I've seen a lot of cancer
patients in my career.

447
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,581
And no matter
the type or stage,

448
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:22,751
the treatment process --
it's grueling.

449
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:24,988
Some people say
the side effects of it

450
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:27,457
or just as horrible
as the cancer itself.

451
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,526
Everyone has
the same questions,

452
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:32,195
and they reckon with
the same concerns.

453
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:35,265
Cancer is universal
that way.

454
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,167
It's universal.

455
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,968
What if I can find a precedent
for protecting fertility

456
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:41,870
when treating other cancers?

457
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,473
Then I'd be willing
to bet it's relevant

458
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:45,308
to colorectal cancer, too.

459
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:54,150
Oh, Jo. Jo.

460
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:56,186
Ben Warren.
Oh, my God!

461
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,154
You missed me, I missed you.
It's great to be back.

462
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:00,689
I just gave someone a heparin
drip instead of prophylaxis.

463
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:02,591
How do I stop it?

464
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:04,660
Oh, yeah.
The new EMR system is confusing.

465
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:06,496
Okay, type in
the patient's MRN there,

466
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:09,598
and then you are
gonna click here.

467
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,167
-Okay.
-Here.

468
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:12,035
-Okay.
-You're done.

469
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,003
Okay.

470
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:15,371
I've had three careers.
You think I'd remember that

471
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,772
the first day
is always rough.

472
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:19,342
It'll get better.
Kwan is lapping me,

473
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:20,642
and he's only been a doctor
eight months.

474
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:23,947
You'll be fine.
You've been off fighting fires.

475
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,849
I went from splicing intestines
to delivering babies,

476
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,119
and I still have no idea
what day it is,

477
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:30,453
and I'm a constant mess.

478
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:32,989
Yeah?
What's new in your life?

479
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:34,924
Can you keep it a secret?

480
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:36,126
Yeah.

481
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,027
Yasuda, are you okay?

482
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:40,263
I need your help.

483
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:41,998
Okay.

484
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:47,636
Hey. Turkey burgers
from the cafeteria.

485
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,939
Listen, I think earlier
I might have, uh...

486
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:52,442
Insinuated that
you know the job better than me?

487
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,111
You're lucky I'm hungry.

488
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:56,913
Hey, would you ever get
a butt lift?

489
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,315
Uh, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm not suggesting --

490
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:00,917
you are --
you are perfect.

491
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,684
But there's a woman
in the ER.

492
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:05,754
She just had one,
and, uh, I don't get it.

493
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,023
What don't you get?

494
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:09,159
Well, it's a surgery with risks,
and why?

495
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:10,927
So you can wear
different clothes?

496
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,695
Wait. You think that
this woman underwent anesthesia,

497
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:16,665
had surgeons cut into her
glutes, suck fat from her belly,

498
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:18,635
and put it back in her butt

499
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:21,471
just so that she could
wear different clothes?

500
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:22,605
I mean,
why else would she do it?

501
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,909
Let me break it down
for you.

502
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,809
The world that you live in,
where you do a good job

503
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:29,279
and you get rewarded
for it --

504
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:31,147
that is not the world
that women live in.

505
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,449
In our world,
you can be smarter,

506
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,285
you can work harder,

507
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:38,655
but the prettier person
who has a more desirable body

508
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:40,957
most always gets ahead
because

509
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,194
the people who decide that
are almost always men.

510
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,964
So before we rush to judge
the woman for being so desperate

511
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:50,166
that she underwent surgery
to change her body,

512
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,767
maybe we should think about

513
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,802
how our culture prioritizes
the wrong things

514
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,972
and think about
how we can change that.

515
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,007
I was just asking.

516
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:00,176
And I was just answering.

517
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,578
Sorry.
I have to take this.

518
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,246
Um, thank you
for the burger.

519
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:05,682
Yeah. No.
Um, I want to review that.

520
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:07,016
I never thought I'd say this,

521
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,085
but I am missing Pearl.

522
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:10,486
Is that your partner
or your friend?

523
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,522
My booty pillow.

524
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:14,257
These cheeks could use
a good cushion.

525
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,857
Are you in more pain?

526
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:17,660
A little.

527
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:20,330
Well, the scans will be quick,
so just try to sit still.

528
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:21,698
I know what you're thinking.

529
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,666
<i>Trust me.</i>

530
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,935
<i>My family gave me grief</i>
<i>for getting surgery, too.</i>

531
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:28,538
But for 30 years,
no one blinked an eye at me.

532
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:30,940
I was a sidekick
with a pancake butt.

533
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:35,578
But then overnight,
I became the star.

534
00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:38,915
I've never felt
more empowered in my own skin.

535
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:40,350
Forget the jobs
that work from home

536
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:41,918
and the movies
on the couch.

537
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:46,456
I'm planning on taking
this beauty all across town.

538
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:48,591
Oh, the labs are in.

539
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:51,961
White count is 18,000.
That can't be right.

540
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:53,963
Are you sure you're
looking at the right value?

541
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:55,864
Yeah, I'm more than familiar
with our lab results system.

542
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,501
If you want to rerun them,
I'll let Dr. Hunt know.

543
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,670
These numbers are
off the charts.

544
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:03,539
Scans are up.

545
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,109
You see that?
Extensive signs of infection

546
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,578
to the muscle
along the fascial planes.

547
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,747
Are we done?

548
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:12,682
Judith, I'm gonna have
to check your hip again.

549
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:15,784
May I?
Yeah.

550
00:23:15,918 --> 00:23:18,820
Is that...
Necrotizing fasciitis.

551
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:20,523
Someone help me
with this gurney?

552
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:21,823
What's going on?
What's happening?

553
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,293
You have a fast-moving
soft-tissue infection.

554
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:25,328
But don't worry.
We're faster.

555
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:27,363
I need you to page
the attendings and book
an OR right now.

556
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:29,632
On my count.
One, two, three.

557
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:39,075
I like that painting.

558
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,311
Get to wake up to the sunrise
even when it's raining.

559
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:48,251
I thought you were gonna say,
even in the middle of the day,

560
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:50,787
Mm. That, too.
Mm-hmm.

561
00:23:52,655 --> 00:23:54,424
I, um...

562
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:57,160
I got it at
an Italian restaurant.

563
00:23:57,293 --> 00:24:00,430
Is it Nicoletti's?

564
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:04,934
No, it was a little cafe
in Cortona, Italy.

565
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,302
I was going through
a rough time,

566
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:09,205
so I booked a redeye
to Florence.

567
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,507
And I told myself I would visit
every art museum

568
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:14,843
between there
and Vatican City.

569
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:18,915
I strained my neck,
gazing at Michelangelo's work

570
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:22,652
in the Sistine Chapel,
and, uh...

571
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:24,821
I don't know.
When I saw that sunrise,

572
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,389
it lifted something up
in me.

573
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:34,697
So I asked the restaurant owner
if he would sell it to me.

574
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:38,000
You know how sometimes
you just...

575
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:40,603
feel a strong
connection?

576
00:24:40,737 --> 00:24:41,870
I do.

577
00:24:57,053 --> 00:24:58,855
Page me as soon
as his ABG gets back.

578
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:00,390
Dr. Ndugu's asking.

579
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,561
Dr. Griffith?

580
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:11,667
So how was everything
with the patient in the ER?

581
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,469
Things seem smooth?

582
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,705
Everything appeared
in control.

583
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:19,409
I don't think you have anything
to worry about on the case.

584
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,145
Wait. You <i>think</i>
or you know?

585
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:24,580
Are we talking about
Big-Booty Judy, or -- right.

586
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:32,355
Look, um, it's not that
I don't think he will succeed.

587
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:34,590
Um, I also want to
make sure

588
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:37,360
that he has an objective
experience,

589
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,263
the same treatment
as everyone.

590
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,965
And if <i>I</i>  go down there,

591
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:48,471
my appearance in the room
takes away that objectivity.

592
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:50,473
I can spare
another five minutes.

593
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:51,674
Thank you.

594
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,915
So you'd move my ovaries
into my abdomen?

595
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,583
We'd move them up and attach
them to the abdominal wall

596
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:02,785
so they're out of the field
of radiation.

597
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,421
Has this been done
before?

598
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:07,990
Ovarian transposition
is often used to help

599
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:11,093
preserve the fertility
of cervical cancer patients,

600
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:14,597
but there's no reason
it couldn't apply to your case.

601
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,299
I'd be able
to have kids later?

602
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:19,602
There is a 50% to 80%
success rate.

603
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,270
That's better than zero.

604
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:24,106
And if we can preserve
your ovarian function,

605
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,443
then you likely will not need
hormone replacements.

606
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:29,913
This is great.
Thank you so much.

607
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,114
Thank your sister.
She's the one who thought of it.

608
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:33,783
Can we do this today?

609
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,852
That way I can start
treatment sooner,

610
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:37,854
finish my last semester
before my scholarship runs out.

611
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,255
I should totally do this
right now, right?

612
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:40,857
I mean,
just get it done?

613
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,426
Yeah, I'm gonna call
Mom and Dad first, but yes.

614
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,794
You want Dr. Weber
and Dr. Wilson

615
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:46,629
to be the ones to do it.

616
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,998
And you can be
in the operating room with me?

617
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:52,435
I can't, Chloe.
Family's not allowed.

618
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:55,037
Oh. Right.

619
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:58,774
Hey, think of it like one
of your cross-country races.

620
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,476
It'll be over
before you know it.

621
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,411
And I will be as close
as I can be, okay?

622
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:04,280
-Okay.
-Okay?

623
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:07,416
Okay.
Let's do it.

624
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:16,325
Do you always eat
when you're scanning patients?

625
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:18,294
Well, I mean, technically
he's not a patient,

626
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:21,531
and he's in a bag
and dead.

627
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,104
Oh, Yasuda's sister
is getting surgery.

628
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:29,505
Is it an emergency?

629
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,140
It doesn't seem like it.

630
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,477
They're waiting
for an OR to open.

631
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,013
What's going on
between you two?

632
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:37,915
Uh, nothing.

633
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,448
Oh.

634
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:42,685
Is that her?
No, it's Maxine.

635
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:43,753
Spaghetti and meatballs
for dinner.

636
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:45,254
Yasuda's not texting me.

637
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,759
She basically accused me
of having no empathy.

638
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:52,628
Well, her sister has cancer.
She's just stressed.

639
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:54,965
Well, you know what's <i>not</i> going
to make her sister get better?

640
00:27:55,097 --> 00:27:56,165
Being mean to me.

641
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,969
Really?!

642
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,436
He can't hear me.

643
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:06,509
Heart rate's in the 140s.
Systolic's around 100.

644
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:08,811
We broadened IV antibiotics
and started low-dose norepi.

645
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:10,613
Judith, we're taking you
up to the OR

646
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:12,481
to remove the infected tissue
and stop it spreading, okay?

647
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,183
You're gonna
take my butt?

648
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,585
The infection seems
to have spread to your glute,

649
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:16,786
but we won't know
till we get to the OR.

650
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,254
No, I want
a second opinion.

651
00:28:18,387 --> 00:28:19,121
There's no time
for another opinion.

652
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:21,123
You <i>have</i> to trust us.

653
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:23,092
I don't understand.
I just fell on the sidewalk.

654
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:24,995
The bacteria must got in
through the cut on your thigh.

655
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:26,964
It's rare,
but it happens.

656
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,631
Do you know
what it's like to be invisible?

657
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:29,799
If there were
any other options,

658
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:31,767
we would tell you,
I promise, Judith.

659
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:34,004
Judith. Judith. Judith!

660
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:36,772
Damn it, she's septic.
Come on, come on, come on.

661
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,140
Okay, let's go!
Let's move!

662
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:43,579
Mr. Riley, hold on.
I got ya.

663
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:45,615
I need a hand in here!
Griffin!

664
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:46,782
He started crashing
a minute ago.

665
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:49,118
I need to intubate.
Push 30 of etomidate,

666
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:50,954
- 150 of sux.
- On it.

667
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:52,788
Where is Griffith?
I got the intubation tray.

668
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:54,190
All right,
let's get you some air.

669
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:56,792
Here we go.
Here we go.

670
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:59,829
Ah, come on.

671
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,797
Damn it! Help!

672
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:03,366
Helm, get in here!

673
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:06,869
I need you to apply
cricoid pressure.

674
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:08,771
There?
Higher.

675
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:10,506
There. You're right there.
Right there.

676
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,642
And I'm in.
Al right.

677
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:16,178
Come on.

678
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:18,015
Oh, his sats aren't improving.

679
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,815
We need to get him on ECMO
before the hypoxemia

680
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,118
puts too much stress
on his heart and he codes.

681
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,818
I need an ECMO machine
right now!

682
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,467
What happened?

683
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:40,103
He was intubated,
but he wasn't oxygenating.

684
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,837
You'd know that if you were
monitoring him like I asked.

685
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:43,706
I'm sorry. I ran down
to the emergency room --

686
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,508
I don't want to hear it.
Wait outside.

687
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:46,943
Helm, get the tube ready.

688
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:56,752
Okay.
I hit a pocket of fluid.

689
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,155
Suction.

690
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:00,523
Oh!

691
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:01,757
Oh, she's gonna be
devastated

692
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:03,659
when she wakes up
and it's all gone.

693
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:04,593
Well, at least
she'll still be here.

694
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:05,828
If we can work
fast enough.

695
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:07,263
I'm gonna need another
set of hands.

696
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:08,364
Warren, are you ready
to get in here?

697
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:10,299
Sure. Scalpel.

698
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:15,939
Good.
Quick and intentional.

699
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:17,306
I can help
if you need it.

700
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,607
Just keep up
with the suction.

701
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:23,446
Actually, you know,
I could use a hand in here.

702
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:25,414
Kwan, you wanna help break up
some of this tissue?

703
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:26,615
Yeah.

704
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:32,788
Oh, I see
healthy tissue.

705
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:34,790
Yeah, there it is.

706
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:37,827
Bleeding edges.
Nice work...boss.

707
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,064
Moving on to the superior
aspect of the thigh.

708
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,100
Last one.

709
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,469
Do you remember
your med-school cadaver?

710
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:49,206
Yeah. 68-year-old female,
lungs full of mets.

711
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:51,707
Uh, we assumed
she was a smoker.

712
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:54,376
Named her Marge
and decided she was a trucker.

713
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,279
Mm.
Mine was my grandma.

714
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:59,983
Uh, wait. You, uh, dissected
your grandmother?

715
00:31:00,117 --> 00:31:02,651
What?
God, no. No, no.

716
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:04,988
My dad's mom died
before I was born,

717
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,523
and then my mom
really hated hers,

718
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:09,859
so I-I kind of grew up
without a grandma.

719
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:14,663
But we had been dissecting
our cadaver for weeks

720
00:31:14,797 --> 00:31:16,599
before we finally took
the towel off her face.

721
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:19,802
And I remember looking at her
and thinking,

722
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:21,303
she could be my grandma.

723
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:26,176
And I just hoped
that she didn't feel...alone.

724
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:28,245
I hoped she felt that
she was surrounded by people

725
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,114
who truly appreciated her.

726
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:35,484
I, uh...I never
thought about it that way.

727
00:31:35,618 --> 00:31:38,255
Yeah. And then we cut open
her neck and her head and...

728
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:41,158
finished it.

729
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,162
Um...could you transfer the
scans to the CDs by yourself?

730
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:47,296
There's something
I really need to do.

731
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:49,865
Yeah?
Yeah, okay.

732
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,180
Hey, any, uh, news from the pit?

733
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,347
How is he?

734
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:07,349
He's on ECMO
and stable,

735
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:09,019
but I don't know if he'll ever
breathe on his own again.

736
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:10,287
I'm so sorry.

737
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:11,420
What were you doing
in the ER

738
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,956
when my patients
are up here?

739
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,456
Please explain that
to me.

740
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,524
Oh, uh, w-why don't we
take a breath?

741
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:17,928
I'm breathing just fine.
Thank you.

742
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,762
I was checking on a patient
for a colleague --

743
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,198
In the ER?

744
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,865
Doctor Ndugu --
Dr. Bailey, hold on.

745
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:25,302
If I can't trust you
to follow simple instructions,

746
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:27,304
I can't have you
on my service.
Dr. Ndugu...

747
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:29,005
I asked you to step in
because --
...I need a word.

748
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,806
in private.

749
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:44,154
Okay.

750
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,835
We're about
to start the anesthesia.

751
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,370
Are you ready?

752
00:33:01,503 --> 00:33:03,907
Okay.
Wait.
Um, excuse me.

753
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:05,474
<i>Is it all right if I...</i>

754
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,646
Hi. I'm Jules.
We met this morning.

755
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:12,414
I'm one of the interns.

756
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:13,316
I know who you are.

757
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:55,491
Hey, <i>I</i>  asked Griffith
to check on the patient

758
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:57,994
in the emergency room.

759
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:00,931
I didn't realize that your
patient was borderline critical.

760
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:03,632
She knew.
She should have said no.

761
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:07,770
I'm her boss, right?
It's not her fault.

762
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:09,372
Why -- Why did you send her
downstairs?

763
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,207
You're not working
there today.

764
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,609
I don't know.
I...

765
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:16,413
First day back
in a while.

766
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:20,317
I wanted to see
how things were going.

767
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,583
That's all.

768
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:24,154
Okay. Take it from the guy
who married

769
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:26,189
and then divorced
his boss.

770
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:27,790
Get out of
your husband's way.

771
00:34:27,924 --> 00:34:29,625
I beg your pardon?

772
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:31,361
I'm saying at home
you need to be a team.

773
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:33,930
At work, let him be
his own person.

774
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:41,938
Hey. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

775
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:43,373
The appointment was
at 5:00, right?

776
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:45,141
I know. I just got
so busy with patients,

777
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,243
I completely forgot.
You don't have to apologize.

778
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,180
DeLuca had to leave.
We were gonna see the baby.

779
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:52,916
Mm, we'll just reschedule.

780
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,085
Wait.
Come with me.

781
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:01,291
Judith,
how are you feeling?

782
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:03,659
You really have to ask?

783
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:05,261
You should be feeling
better soon.

784
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,263
We were able to remove
the infected tissue.

785
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,132
Yeah, we'll keep you in the ICU
for a few more days

786
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:10,266
to wash out the wound
and make sure

787
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,435
there's no more
necrotic tissue.

788
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,204
Okay, Trauma.
Kwan, come with me.

789
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:15,804
Uh, check on the cultures,
and we'll see you downstairs.

790
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,507
Judith, I will come
check on you soon, okay?

791
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:25,448
Ah.

792
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,283
I know it feels
like you're going back

793
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,285
to an old version
of yourself.

794
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,653
But I've learned when it feels
like you're losing ground,

795
00:35:31,787 --> 00:35:33,990
you're still
moving forward.

796
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:36,192
Everything you've learned,
everything you've experienced,

797
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:38,128
it all comes with you.

798
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,363
I can't tell you what's
not coming with me.

799
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:43,433
The $8,000 I spent
on my butt.

800
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:48,004
No, but all that confidence
you gained after the lift --

801
00:35:48,138 --> 00:35:50,340
we didn't take
any of that.

802
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:52,275
Are you saying
I have big-butt energy?

803
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:56,146
I'm saying all is not lost.

804
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,482
But if down the road you
decide you want reconstruction,

805
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,252
I know a great plastic surgeon
in Boston.

806
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:04,254
Now you're talking.

807
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:06,990
Get some rest.

808
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:19,768
She's doing well.

809
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:21,471
There were no complications,
and Dr. Webber says

810
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:25,341
she should be able
to go home soon.

811
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,576
I'm sorry
for what I said earlier.

812
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:30,980
Sometimes I can be
such a...

813
00:36:31,114 --> 00:36:33,149
Thank you
for sitting with her.

814
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:37,253
You have no idea
how much that meant to her.

815
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:39,621
How much it meant to me.

816
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:43,293
Well, I knew
you couldn't do it, so...

817
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:44,760
didn't want her
to be alone.

818
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,206
Thank you for everything.

819
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,942
Well, I was glad to help.

820
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:02,479
Oh, it's not easy to watch
someone you love fight cancer.

821
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:03,812
They'll be days
you feel like

822
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:05,848
your heart's being
ripped to pieces.

823
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,519
Remember to take care
of yourself, too.

824
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:13,156
Thank you.

825
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:29,038
Hey. You still haven't finished
uploading all the scans.

826
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:30,440
Yeah, I know.

827
00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:33,409
Adams,
they have this covered.

828
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,612
Hey, hey!
Show some respect.

829
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:36,778
These people donated
their bodies

830
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:38,615
so that future doctors
could learn

831
00:37:38,747 --> 00:37:41,817
how to help others live longer,
healthier lives.

832
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,187
Okay, sorry.

833
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,821
I wanted to help.

834
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,999
Hey. Oh, aren't you supposed
to be getting the kids?

835
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:58,834
Yeah, well, I thought we could
grab a bite first.

836
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:00,436
Oh, I can, uh,
either eat with you

837
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,671
or feed the kids,
but I don't have time for both.

838
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,910
-Do you not feel this?
-Feel what?

839
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,578
Ever since we got rehired,

840
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,580
we haven't had
a single meal alone together.

841
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:13,749
We haven't had a conversation
that wasn't about surgery

842
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,351
or the kids' schedules
in almost three weeks.

843
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,353
Well, work has been busy,
but, you know,

844
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:20,523
we'll get back on track
eventually.

845
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,824
It's just...

846
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,826
feels like we're
not connecting, you know?

847
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:27,130
It feels like there's
something eating away

848
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,932
at this relationship.

849
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:30,333
And I know I stepped in it
more than once today --

850
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:34,671
No, it's --
it's not just you.

851
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:36,472
I feel it, too.

852
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,508
<i>When a patient codes</i>
<i>in surgery,</i>

853
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:43,079
<i>the first thing we do</i>
<i>is remove their drape.</i>

854
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:45,281
<i>We need to see</i>
<i>if there's something we missed.</i>

855
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:54,490
Is this a mistake?
Me being your boss?

856
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,758
When are you not my boss?

857
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:58,595
"Ben, can you take out
the garbage?

858
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,363
Ooh, ooh, babe,
kill that spider.

859
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:03,366
Ben, why haven't you changed
the light in the refrigerator?"

860
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:06,835
Oh, don't be cute.
You know what I mean.

861
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,972
We're professionals.

862
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:10,940
I'm not worried.

863
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,678
Okay, but if it ever gets
uncomfortable for you --

864
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:17,680
I will let you know.

865
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,815
I promise.

866
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:23,920
Hey.

867
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:25,321
Let's get home
so I can get some sleep.

868
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:26,788
Ah!

869
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:29,325
I have pre-rounds
before sunrise.

870
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:31,961
Welcome back, Dr. Warren.
Oh.

871
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:34,830
<i>Much like in surgery,</i>
<i>sometimes in life</i>

872
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:36,699
<i>we lose sight</i>
<i>of the bigger picture.</i>

873
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:41,504
Mimi.

874
00:39:41,638 --> 00:39:43,006
Hey.

875
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:44,707
How are you feeling?

876
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,576
Tired.

877
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,279
And I kind of
want a donut.

878
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:52,115
Go back to sleep.
You need rest.

879
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:54,450
Mimi.
We will get donuts.

880
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,354
Thanks for everything.

881
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:00,657
I didn't do anything.

882
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,592
I couldn't even be
in your surgery, remember?

883
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:05,094
I meant as my sister.

884
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,795
Shh.
Close your eyes.

885
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:25,415
-Hi.
-Hey.

886
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,617
We brought things.

887
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,786
How's she doing?
Good.

888
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,821
She's already
asking about snacks.

889
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:34,290
That tracks.
Yeah.

890
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:36,959
Let you both sleep.

891
00:40:37,093 --> 00:40:41,931
Thanks, uh,
for all the stuff.

892
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,600
We also took all of your shifts
for the next week

893
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,637
so you can spend time
with Chloe.

894
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,674
Thank you, guys.

895
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:57,613
<i>When we're stressed</i>
<i>or worried,</i>

896
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,416
<i>it can be hard to see</i>
<i>the things that are going well.</i>

897
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,807
<i>And when we're floating</i>
<i>on cloud nine,</i>

898
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,977
<i>it's just as easy</i>
<i>to miss red flags.</i>

899
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:33,616
<i>Expanding our perspective</i>
<i>can give us a better,</i>

900
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,185
<i>more accurate view of ourselves</i>
<i>and the world.</i>

901
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,820
I don't see anything.
Do you?

902
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,157
Mm. Just my intestines.
Stop moving it around.

903
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:45,728
Well, I still don't see
anything.

904
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,598
Oh, wait. Is that...?

905
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:51,701
Yeah.
There's our baby.

906
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:53,870
And there's
the heartbeat.

907
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,840
You don't see it,
do you?

908
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,243
You see it right there?

909
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,479
Oh, and also there.

910
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:08,317
Oh, my God!

911
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:09,919
Twins.
Twins?

912
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,261
<i>It may end up being more than</i>
<i>you could have ever imagined.</i>
