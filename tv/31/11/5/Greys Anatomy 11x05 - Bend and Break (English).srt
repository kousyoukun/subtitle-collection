1
00:00:02,473 --> 00:00:05,044
Uncontrollable bleeding.

2
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,157
Acidosis.

3
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:08,860
Cold.

4
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:11,761
We all know what the combination means.

5
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:14,398
We call it the triad of death,

6
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:17,468
the point of no return.

7
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:21,238
We've been talking about
having another baby for months!

8
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,740
We were excited! We were
discussing freaking names!

9
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,484
Why would you do that...
just to get my hopes up?

10
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,975
You're attacking me for something

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,778
- that I never even said!
- You didn't have to say anything!

12
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,080
It's clear from everything that
you do that you don't want this.

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,915
Why start training all over again?

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,784
You're an amazing pediatric surgeon.

15
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:37,519
People cross the country just to
have you operate on their kids.

16
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:38,887
For the last time,

17
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,622
the fellowship is advancing
my career, which is...

18
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:42,323
Which is not advancing this family!

19
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,425
It's the moment in the O.R.

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,093
When you turn to damage control.

21
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:48,429
Callie, actually, if
I could stop you there,

22
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:50,757
I'm interested to hear the
rest of Arizona's sentence.

23
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:53,183
Arizona, you were going to say... ?

24
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,436
You stop.

25
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,505
You step back.

26
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,542
You let the body rest and
see if you can find a solution

27
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,778
to the chaos that's happening inside.

28
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,378
- Courtney, you're doing great.
- Clamp.

29
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:07,071
Is she okay? Tell me she's okay.

30
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:09,197
Are you kidding? She's
absolutely beautiful.

31
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:11,185
- Isn't that right, Robbins?
- She's so beautiful.

32
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:13,654
We're just gonna check her out
and get her a little oxygen.

33
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:16,023
Lap pads.

34
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:19,025
- All right, the placenta, Robbins.
- Yeah, I got it.

35
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,494
Uh, hey, Alex, how are her sats?

36
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:22,028
Below 90, but improving with bagging.

37
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:23,129
All right, let's get her ready to go.

38
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:24,864
Robbins, the baby is
no longer your patient.

39
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:25,965
Pay attention here.

40
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:32,573
Arizona, you ready?

41
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,509
Um...

42
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:41,480
I love when you talk to a patient

43
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,593
and it's like they're the
only person in the whole world.

44
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,821
I love, um, you bite your
lip just a teeny bit...

45
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,689
it's barely noticeable...
when you study scans,

46
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:51,421
and I find it really sexy.

47
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,927
I love when you do the voices

48
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,996
when you read to Sofia at
night and make her laugh

49
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:02,028
and I could listen to that sound all day...

50
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:04,604
for the rest of my life.

51
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:10,042
And you smile when you sleep...
like, big, like, crazy-big.

52
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,744
And I love that when I wake up,

53
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:13,045
that's the first thing I see.

54
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,447
Uh, and I love...

55
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:18,016
See, why... why don't you just... God.

56
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:22,430
Callie, do you want to talk about
how Arizona's words make you feel?

57
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:26,391
Um, well, it's just... I just... I... I...

58
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,361
If you'd say this stuff
out loud once in a while.

59
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:31,429
I would if you'd let me.

60
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:33,090
- Wait, what?
- I was just saying them

61
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,633
right now, and then you cut me off,

62
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,768
I mean, you're too busy
trying to speak for me...

63
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:38,503
Okay, remember the language

64
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:40,037
we talked about using with each other.

65
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:45,009
I feel that you're always cutting...

66
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,911
Well, I feel that you're
constantly accusing me of this...

67
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:48,646
I feel you did that again.

68
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,815
- She just did it again!
- Let's try again.

69
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:54,418
Callie, I feel, uh,

70
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:55,786
that you should go with a primary repair.

71
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,788
Eh, I feel the artery's
missing too large a piece.

72
00:02:57,822 --> 00:02:59,089
We'll do an interposition graft.

73
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:00,624
W... You agreed with me in pre-op.

74
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,677
Yeah, well, I changed my
mind once I got in here

75
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:04,103
and saw the extent of the defect.

76
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:05,871
Um, finished ligating the bleeders,

77
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:07,339
so we're all set up here.

78
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:09,842
Yeah, and I don't see any more
bone fragments, Dr. Torres, so...

79
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,839
When you so quickly
disregard my medical opinion,

80
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:14,602
it makes me feel like you forget
that I'm a pediatric surgeon

81
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,961
who knows that interpositional grafts

82
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:17,287
can cause complications in children.

83
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:18,913
Well, when you question me in the O.R.,

84
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,838
it makes me feel like you
don't think I can do my job.

85
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:23,184
- We'll use a PTFE graft, Wilson.
- Use the great saphenous vein, Wilson.

86
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,876
We don't need any synthetic materials.

87
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,712
Okay, fine, cut into the kid's leg.

88
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,761
It's not about the leg.

89
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:34,721
It was never about the...
It goes way before the leg.

90
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:39,045
Four years ago, I received
the grant of a lifetime.

91
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,949
Going to Africa, working in that clinic...

92
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:43,251
That was an opportunity that I
never thought that I would get.

93
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:44,486
You followed your dream. You went.

94
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:45,753
But you were supposed to go with me,

95
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,155
and you were miserable

96
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,356
and letting everyone know about it.

97
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,691
And so I went. I went without you,

98
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:51,098
and then I came back... for you.

99
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,383
I came back for you.

100
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,483
- And when I came back, you were...
- Pregnant?

101
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,588
I'm bisexual.

102
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:02,446
I'm attracted to both men and
women, and it freaks her out.

103
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,639
Yes, I slept with Mark. I got pregnant.

104
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:07,742
I was pregnant. And?

105
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,702
And I had no time to process it.

106
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:11,864
I was so in love with you,

107
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,871
I just wanted to be
with you, no matter what.

108
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:15,616
And i-if in order to be with you...

109
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,518
If you're about to say what
I think you're about to say...

110
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:18,652
Let me get a word in, Callie!

111
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:20,154
I trapped you into a kid,

112
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:22,890
a kid you never wanted,
and now you're stuck.

113
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:26,660
Don't you ever say

114
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:29,529
that I don't love my child
or that I regret my child!

115
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:32,212
I regret that you made a decision for me!

116
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:33,834
You make all the choices!

117
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:36,035
And every time that I try to
make a decision for myself,

118
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,337
it's like you make me feel like

119
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,506
the worst, most selfish
person in the whole world!

120
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,674
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,842
Did I make you feel selfish

122
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:43,744
when you decided to
sleep with another woman?

123
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:48,248
- I'm so sorry.
- That's not what I meant,

124
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:50,216
and you know that's not what I meant.

125
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:53,253
I meant that anytime that I
try and do something for myself,

126
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,989
you... you... j...

127
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,192
Callie, the session's not done yet.

128
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:01,275
It feels pretty done.

129
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:02,710
No!

130
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,439
That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

131
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:06,499
It is not a stupid idea.
She didn't mean "stupid."

132
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,867
She just said the word "stupid," so...

133
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:08,901
You're talking about spending

134
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,836
a large portion of my grant money

135
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,672
on a complicated staged
facial reconstruction

136
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:14,907
for one patient.

137
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,709
So, what, you want to just reject him?

138
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:19,278
No, we find a way to help
him that's less stupid!

139
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,747
Okay, I'm gonna grab
lunch. Hunt, find me later.

140
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:28,723
What's going on?

141
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:34,293
It's just I keep giving
and giving and giving.

142
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,194
You're giving me things
I didn't ask for, Callie.

143
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,631
That is not true! All I've done is
everything that you've asked me to do.

144
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,300
You asked me to not leave you
after the plane crash. I didn't.

145
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,536
You wanted me to stay after
you cheated on me. I did.

146
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,438
Then you wanted a house. We got it.

147
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,267
I do everything for you, Arizona,

148
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,274
- because I love you.
- I love you, too!

149
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,376
Well, and now we're here,
and I want something,

150
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,546
and you can't give it to
me. You won't give it to me.

151
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,448
I never said that I didn't want a baby!

152
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,049
The whole reason that we're here

153
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,917
is because of you and what you want.

154
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:02,086
I am trying to give you what you want,

155
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,388
- but you make it so hard.
- Why can't you commit to anything?

156
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:06,916
I've committed the past
five years of my life to you.

157
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,995
We're... not getting anywhere.

158
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,673
We've circled right
back to where we started.

159
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,933
It may be time to hit the reset button.

160
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,268
Great. Let's... let's reset.

161
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,603
How?

162
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:22,305
Have you ever considered
spending some time apart?

163
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,007
Because a break can actually...

164
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,308
You mean a separation? No.

165
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,363
We're trying to save our
marriage, not destroy it.

166
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,980
- I don't want to do that.
- Let her finish.

167
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,498
Don't think of it as a separation.

168
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,323
You two have gone through so much.

169
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,791
You're completely different people

170
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,226
than when you first got together.

171
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,862
It can be helpful to
rediscover who you are,

172
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,485
take a break from one another.

173
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,520
Break, separation... it's the same thing.

174
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,641
It's the first step to divorce. Is
this what you want? Is this what you...

175
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,709
- Let her finish.
- Look, in my experience,

176
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:48,995
couples come to therapy
for one of two reasons.

177
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,412
Either one person wants
out of the relationship

178
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,210
and they need help telling the other,

179
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:55,680
or they both desperately
want to make it work.

180
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,281
They want to fight to make it work.

181
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:59,013
Well, we want to make it work, right?

182
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,818
Right. Right.

183
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,386
And a break is not an end.

184
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,513
A break is a tool to help make it work,

185
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:05,922
for an agreed-upon time,

186
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:08,692
and then we come together,
re-evaluate the relationship.

187
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:10,360
No. I don't like it. I don't... no.

188
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,563
I think it's crazy. I'm sorry, I do.

189
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,130
I mean, we're supposed
to be getting closer,

190
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:15,299
so, what, we need more space?

191
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,367
No, we need more time together, not apart.

192
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,836
That's how you make things work, right?

193
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,536
No break, right?

194
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,236
I think we should take a break.

197
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:43,206
How long... how long will the break last?

198
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:44,999
As long as you'd like. We decide that now.

199
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,657
Okay. Um...

200
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:48,635
30 days?

201
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:50,804
30 days? A month?

202
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,473
You need a break from me for a whole month?

203
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,176
Arizona, you want to say
something, now is the time.

204
00:07:58,134 --> 00:07:59,727
Callie, I was trying to be nice.

205
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:01,107
I don't even think
that that'd be enough.

206
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,632
I mean, if I thought you'd go for it,

207
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:05,424
maybe three months, six months.

208
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,271
Oh... oh, my God. Six months?

209
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,663
I'm trying to be honest.

210
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,656
I want to save us, but
the only way that I know

211
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:12,138
how to do this is by being honest.

212
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:13,882
This feels like a joke.

213
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,042
Or a reality show.

214
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,010
"Real lesbian housewives M.D. of Seattle."

215
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,720
Fine, 30 days. How does it work?

216
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,489
You have a child, so for her sake,

217
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,491
you two will live in the house as parents,

218
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:35,462
but with separate lives, separate rooms.

219
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,763
Boundaries are vital.

220
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:40,066
Make a schedule for
child-care responsibilities,

221
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,266
and stick to it.

222
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:43,769
No talking,

223
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:46,885
no communication, except in emergencies.

224
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:50,475
Lastly... This is important...

225
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:54,380
No intimacy, no sex,

226
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:58,463
with other people or with each other.

227
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,663
Sofia's getting dressed.

228
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:10,929
She also seems to be continuing

229
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,064
the purple theme she's
got going on this week.

230
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,804
Arizona, I didn't sleep at all.

231
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,083
I can't do this.

232
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,442
It's been one night, and, um...

233
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,363
I feel we don't need this.

234
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:31,582
How are we seriously supposed
to not talk for an entire month?

235
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:38,455
Just... please, just please
look at me. I need to talk.

236
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,717
Emily, I'm sorry. I know it hurts.

237
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:58,144
- Hurts like a bitch.
- Yeah, meds will kick in soon.

238
00:09:58,376 --> 00:09:59,876
You got your arm caught in what, again?

239
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,545
- A noodle-making machine.
- Huh.

240
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,518
It's the dumbest job ever,
but it just pays well,

241
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,926
and I'm trying to get into culinary school,

242
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,218
which is freaking expensive.

243
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,753
Looks like comminuted, displaced

244
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:13,355
- mid-shaft radius and ulna fractures.
- Yep.

245
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,857
Well, Emily,

246
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:17,359
unfortunately, your arm
definitely needs surgery.

247
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:19,195
Now, in order to stabilize the fracture,

248
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,730
I will most likely need to
put in a plate and some screws.

249
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:23,599
Uh, Edwards, call up to the O.R.

250
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,100
How long will it take to heal?

251
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:27,836
I need my arm in shape to
cook, to train for school.

252
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,438
Applications are due in a month.

253
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,407
Well, obviously, it's
a pretty bad fracture,

254
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,574
but we will fix you up,

255
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,242
we will get you into
P.T. as soon as we can,

256
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:36,428
and you will be back at it
before you know it, okay?

257
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:37,603
All right.

258
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,518
Lee Franklin, one day old,

259
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:45,753
diagnosed with esophageal atresia at birth.

260
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,555
Which means that his esophagus

261
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,890
developed in two separate pieces.

262
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,926
I'm sorry, but I thought you
said you could fix the gap.

263
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
When is that gonna happen?

264
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:54,129
Well, unfortunately, Lee's images show

265
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,614
a longer gap than we predicted.

266
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,409
It's measuring around four
centimeters, which prevents us

267
00:10:58,434 --> 00:11:00,234
from simply sewing the
two ends back together.

268
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,569
Dr. Karev can still operate,

269
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:03,404
it just makes the surgery a
little bit more complicated.

270
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,605
Wilson?

271
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,315
We'll attach sutures to
both ends of Lee's esophagus,

272
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,641
threading them out through
incisions in his back.

273
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:13,047
Every day, we'll pull on the sutures,

274
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,883
thereby stretching the ends
inside toward each other

275
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,385
in order to connect
them in a later surgery.

276
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,587
However, for the procedure to work,

277
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:22,957
we'll need Lee to remain extremely still,

278
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:25,059
so we'll need to put him
in a medically induced coma.

279
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:27,328
I'm sorry, but, Dr. Robbins,

280
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:28,595
but why aren't you doing the surgery?

281
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,930
Dr. Karev is now the
attending on this case.

282
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,733
I have recently started a new specialty

283
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:33,933
in a different department.

284
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,435
But I can assure you,

285
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,937
I trained Dr. Karev, and he is awesome.

286
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:40,707
You have to put our baby into a coma?

287
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,193
For how long?

288
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,938
This process could take... weeks.

289
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,913
There are other surgical
options I'd love to go over...

290
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:48,581
But this is the best one for Lee.

291
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,917
Dr. Robbins, can I see you outside?

292
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:54,453
What was that?

293
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:55,688
You're just gonna make them worry.

294
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,757
I was thinking of doing
a colonic interposition.

295
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,093
I fix the kid in one surgery,
he can go home sooner.

296
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,861
No, using the native esophagus is better.

297
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,962
It's a prolonged hospital stay, but...

298
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:06,642
We could have him in a coma
for weeks, maybe months.

299
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,368
I mean, that'll put the
parents through hell.

300
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,645
Using the colon has
increased risks of stricture,

301
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,605
anastomotic leaks, GERD.

302
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,339
I mean, it's not fun to watch
your kid go through that, either.

303
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:16,942
Are you gonna let me do my job, or are
you gonna do it for me the whole time?

304
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,076
Oh, crap, I'm late for rounds.

305
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,444
Okay, listen, just do it my way, okay?

306
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:21,013
Fine, only because he was once your patient

307
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:22,881
and because you're having
trouble cutting the strings.

308
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,682
Yeah, or because you know that I'm right.

309
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,919
Here you go, Doctor.

310
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,520
Thanks.

311
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:30,655
I sent your husband down to the gift shop.

312
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,824
He fainted last time
we talked about needles.

313
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:34,326
Oh, he's such a lightweight.

314
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,770
Well, hopefully, he's
buying you some chocolate.

315
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:37,896
You're late.

316
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,064
I'm so sorry. Uh, I was
checking on a baby in the NICU...

317
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,233
Don't care. Graham, start talking.

318
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,302
Jaclyn Werlein, 23 weeks along...

319
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,764
recent fetal echo of her baby's heart

320
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:47,963
unfortunately confirmed
critical aortic stenosis.

321
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,909
Today, we'll be performing
a fetal aortic valvuloplasty

322
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:53,010
in order to open up the
narrowed aortic valve.

323
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,313
Your B.P.'s a little
high. You feeling okay?

324
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:57,014
I'm a little nervous.

325
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,649
The idea of a giant needle going through me

326
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:01,085
and then my baby's teeny heart...

327
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,920
there doesn't seem to
be much room for error.

328
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:05,722
Dr. Herman has made us the go-to hospital

329
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:06,924
for fetal cardiac intervention.

330
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,192
She is the only surgeon
who even does this procedure

331
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,427
in the Pacific Northwest.

332
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:13,330
She's why I'm here... to learn from her.

333
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:16,232
Jaclyn, I'm not even
going to insert the needle

334
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:19,069
until I'm sure your baby's
in the precise position

335
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:20,938
- that he needs to be.
- Okay.

336
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,106
Position is critical to success.

337
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,575
If the fetus isn't
facing forward, chest up,

338
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:27,510
we can't get to the apex of the heart.

339
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:29,112
Perfect approach, Graham.

340
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,746
We have direct access now.

341
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:32,615
I've been practicing in the lab.

342
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,847
Dr. Herman, I'd be happy to assist.

343
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:37,584
Graham is assisting on
this one. Watch. Take notes.

344
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,177
I've performed dozens

345
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,766
of percutaneous procedures on babies.

346
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,592
Were the babies still in utero?

347
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:44,426
Did they have hearts the size of a walnut?

348
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:45,928
No. No, but...

349
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:47,461
Well, that's not the same, then, is it?

350
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:50,232
Robbins, you have an impeccable record

351
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,034
as a pediatric surgeon.

352
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,403
As a fetal surgeon, big, fat zero.

353
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:58,179
I suggest you pay close
attention to Graham's hands,

354
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,221
and next time, you can assist.

355
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,479
Well, Dr. Herman, my hands are
only trying to emulate yours.

356
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:06,615
Graham, one more word, we're
gonna go over to plastics

357
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,251
and have your lips surgically
removed from my ass.

358
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:13,055
Now, shut up, everyone.
I'm deploying the balloon.

359
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:18,259
Oh, In case you're interested,

360
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,729
there's a model you can
practice on in the skills lab.

361
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:22,230
It's old, and the rubber's hardened,

362
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,633
and it smells gross, but have fun.

363
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,935
- Thanks.
- It took me about two months to nail it.

364
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:28,069
Good luck.

365
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,772
Oh, Edwards, hey.

366
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,764
Um, are you still on Callie's service?

367
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:36,657
No, this is the fourth time

368
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,612
that she has switched Sofia duty on me.

369
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,081
She said she had to practice.

370
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,449
You tell her that her daughter's asking

371
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:42,783
when she's gonna tuck her in at night,

372
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,685
and remind her that we share custody

373
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,854
- in this stupid arrangement.
- Okay, this really isn't

374
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,232
- something that I feel comfortable...
- Get out, Edwards.

375
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,727
Oh, sorry.

376
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,972
You were saying, uh, thyroid cancer?

377
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,032
Patient is David Lasher.

378
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,034
I did a thyroidectomy on him,

379
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:02,135
and since then, he has been cancer-free,

380
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,504
but this morning, he came
in complaining of hip pain,

381
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,373
so I did a PET scan, and...

382
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,507
Bone mets to the hip.

383
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,942
Is there any way to resect this

384
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,377
without doing a total hip replacement?

385
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,779
No, it looks like it involves
too much of the proximal femur.

386
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:15,949
- How old is David?
- 33, two kids and a wife.

387
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,022
How long will a replacement last?

388
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,996
Uh, 10, 15 years.

389
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:22,254
So he'll need another one eventually.

390
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,857
Well, yeah, but we either
resect it and do a total hip now,

391
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,960
or his cancer continues
to spread, and he dies.

392
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,595
Well, it looks like

393
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,096
I'm scheduling a hip replacement.

394
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,660
Yeah. Oh, no.

395
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,418
Don't... don't schedule it now. I have a...

396
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,667
A kid to pick up.

397
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,203
And you have to keep
on a smile on your face

398
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,305
despite your spouse barely speaking to you.

399
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,539
Totally get that.

400
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,727
Good night.

401
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:49,284
Sweet dreams.

402
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,336
Okay.

403
00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:01,233
I had to look at so many
places to find this, but I did.

404
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,695
Hey, Callie.

405
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,665
Are we too loud for Sofia?

406
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,233
No, I just put her down. I thought y...

407
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,931
I thought Arizona had to study.

408
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,041
Right, uh, talking is against the rules.

409
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:19,344
Sorry. Yes, Arizona is studying.

410
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,712
I am helping her make
jello moms to practice on.

411
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,882
The jello is the uterus, and the
grapes... tiny, little baby hearts.

412
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,351
It's the perfect surgical model.

413
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,020
- You go in right here, and...
- Neat.

414
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,956
I'm also making ambrosia salad...

415
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,223
Kepner family recipe.

416
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,832
So, then what did you do?

417
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,043
I followed the rules.

418
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,673
Your rules, by the way... they suck.

419
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:00,774
Okay, almost there.

420
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:04,844
Just move the baby's
left shoulder down, down.

421
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:07,681
Okay. That's good.
Congratulations, Robbins.

422
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:09,816
That was the fastest I've ever seen anyone

423
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,084
flip a fetus into position.

424
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,118
Thank you, Dr. Herman.

425
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:15,054
So, once we get the needle in, you
wanna do the rest of the procedure?

426
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,023
Yes.

427
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:18,648
But I'm not... I'm not sure I should.

428
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:21,003
I've only practiced a couple
times in the skills lab,

429
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:22,562
and I don't know if I'm there yet.

430
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,989
Well, I'm happy to
assist if she's not ready.

431
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:28,101
Graham, I want you to take special
note of what Robbins did there.

432
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:29,368
Oh, yes, ma'am.

433
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:30,569
I saw it.

434
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,805
That's what being an
experienced surgeon gains you...

435
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,007
the wisdom to know your limitations.

436
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,642
She's not gonna let her own arrogance

437
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:37,876
get in the way of patient care.

438
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,272
Good call, Robbins.

439
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,946
Nice work, guys.

440
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,249
Robbins, you'll take the lead
on the next one. Be ready.

441
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,251
Of course, Dr. Herman.

442
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:47,446
Yes!

443
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:50,756
Oh, Emily, I need you to remain still.

444
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,158
I thought the surgery
was supposed to fix it!

445
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:57,129
It still hurts, almost worse
than when it got caught!

446
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,464
Okay, well, you're a little
over a week post-op, Emily.

447
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:01,099
It's still gonna hurt from
time to time. Edwards, labs?

448
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:02,667
Her blood work's completely normal.

449
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:03,935
Uh, the incision looks good...

450
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,138
No sign of infection,
no compartment syndrome.

451
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,907
I can't sleep. I can't eat. Oh!

452
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,875
Okay. Okay.

453
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:14,011
I get these shocks like
two or three times a minute,

454
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:16,046
and I... I can't do it, Dr. Torres.

455
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:20,885
Emily, I am so sorry.
I've run every test.

456
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,687
Nothing's coming up.

457
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,522
- I'm not sure what I can do.
- Something!

458
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:26,757
Got to do something to help me.

459
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,826
I can't live like this.

460
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,195
If I had known it was gonna be like this...

461
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:35,666
Please.

462
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:44,974
Whoa.

463
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,777
Sorry.

464
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:48,445
You're good? You okay?

465
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,913
Am I good?

466
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:52,015
I am obviously not good.
I'm obviously not okay.

467
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,817
Why would you ask that if
you already know the answer?

468
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:55,819
Why not try, "what is it, Callie?"

469
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:58,188
"What can I do, Callie,"
like a human person?

470
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,056
Sorry. I have my own stuff.

471
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,962
No, I'm s...

472
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,194
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

473
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:08,531
I just... I have no one to talk to.

474
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,864
- You on call right now?
- No, why?

475
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,672
- Two more.
- It's called an in-home separation.

476
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,808
We live in the same house.

477
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,509
We trade off caring for Sofia.

478
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:21,877
We just can't talk or have sex.

479
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,746
Exactly what Derek and I
are doing, only healthy.

480
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,349
Oh. Well, cheers to that.

481
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:28,818
Good man in the storm.

482
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,252
What's so "good man in
the storm" about a break?

483
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,487
"How was your day, Meredith?

484
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:32,921
"Did you cure death today, Meredith?

485
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,223
When are you gonna cure death, Meredith?"

486
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,724
- Oh, God.
- "I could have cured death

487
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,592
if you let me move to D.C.
and work for the president."

488
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,627
So I'm bisexual! So what?

489
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:42,030
It's a thing, and it's real.

490
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:45,934
I mean it's called LGBTQ for a reason.

491
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,270
There's a "B" in there, and
it doesn't mean "badass."

492
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,572
Okay, it kind of does,
but it also means bi.

493
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,008
Mm.

494
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:55,777
Mm.

495
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:58,747
My mom and the Chief were
doing it all over the hospital.

496
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,782
- Mnh-mnh.
- All over the hospital,

497
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:03,284
like me and Derek... cheating on Addison.

498
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,219
- I'm a legacy cheater.
- Mm.

499
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:07,355
Maybe Sofia will be a legacy cheater.

500
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,390
Everyone in this hospital's cheated on me.

501
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:13,227
Every single person I have ever
married has cheated on me...

502
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,629
All, uh, two of them?

503
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:16,797
Yeah.

504
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,432
Come on.

505
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:22,579
Cristina was the third
rail in our marriage...

506
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,606
dangerous, fully charged, could kill us,

507
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,408
but necessary for us to keep going.

508
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:28,876
She got me.

509
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,544
You think it's possible

510
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:32,780
that my one true love in my life is a girl?

511
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,382
Did you get excited by her vagina?

512
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,617
No.

513
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:37,818
Then no.

514
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,583
Good point.

515
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,122
♪ Vagina ♪

516
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,257
- ♪ Va-va-va ♪
- ♪ Vagina ♪

517
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,358

518

- ♪ Vagina ♪

519
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:48,628

- It's a weird word.

520
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:51,331
I think it sounds pretty.
People should say it more.

521
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:53,333
Oh, God, I miss sex.

522
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,301
I'm hot. My husband's an idiot.

523
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:00,039
Do it.

524
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:04,109
That might come back up.

525
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,953
Mm.

526
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:19,883
So, you broke the rules.

527
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,652
No. No, we stopped. We didn't have sex.

528
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:25,254
We j... we just... we kissed
and, uh, somehow stopped.

529
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,724
I mean, she'd had that big
surgery with Dr. Herman that day,

530
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:31,761
and all I wanted to do
was ask her how it went.

531
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:33,930
We didn't have sex.

532
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:35,532
Close enough.

533
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,100
Well, now I wish that we
hadn't stopped. So, uh...

534
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,236
So, what happens now?

535
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,537
In order for this to work,

536
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:43,705
you have to follow the
rules for the full 30 days.

537
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,648
You don't mean...

538
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,150
When are you planning
on doing the anastomosis?

539
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:57,586
Ends will be close enough
to join in a day or two.

540
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,755
Latest gapogram shows we're almost there.

541
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,189
How much are you pulling each day?

542
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,124
Uh, about two millimeters.

543
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,359
Oh. One's safer.

544
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:05,594
Why are you up here again?

545
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:08,296
Do you even know what I'm doing?

546
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,731
I am taking a wire the width of a hair

547
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,201
and maneuvering it
through the mom's abdomen,

548
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:14,569
into the uterus,

549
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,304
and then through the amniotic cavity,

550
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:18,473
and then into the tiny fetus' chest,

551
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:22,009
into an insanely tiny
heart, to save a tiny human.

552
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:23,044
Hm. Yay, you.

553
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:25,780
Ok... y... hey, pull gently.

554
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,147
I am. Stop it.

555
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:29,149
Think about all the surgeries
I'll save you from having to do.

556
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,606
Remind me to thank you later.

557
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,788
- Now, would you please...
- My job's gonna make your job obsolete.

558
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:35,923
- Damn it.
- Oh, Alex, no!

559
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,793
You're saying we have to start
this whole ordeal over again?

560
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:41,161
Since we had to reattach
Lee's sutures in the O.R.,

561
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:42,763
it did set us back a few days.

562
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,099
But I assure you, it's a minor
complication of the technique.

563
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,933
Nothing about this is minor!

564
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,502
Now it sounds like you've
just made him worse!

565
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:51,238
- Honey, maybe this...
- She hasn't held her son once.

566
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:52,339
Do you know what that's like for her,

567
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:53,440
for her to stand here

568
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,008
and just see him covered in tubes?

569
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,343
Sir, I'm very sorry.

570
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:57,978
You're the one who should
be the one apologizing.

571
00:23:58,012 --> 00:23:59,179
You were supposed to do the surgery,

572
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:00,446
but you just passed it off to him!

573
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,281
I assure you that Dr. Karev...

574
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,751
Yeah, he's very good. He's
"awesome." We remember.

575
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,655
My baby boy's chest has
now been cut into twice,

576
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:10,998
so you'll forgive me if I
don't share your opinion.

577
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:16,329
- Alex, hey, I'm s...
- No, I'm sorry.

578
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:18,131
I'm sorry for not telling you this sooner.

579
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,433
I never should have let you dictate
a procedure I don't believe in.

580
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:21,700
This is my patient,

581
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:23,702
this is my service, this is my NICU.

582
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:26,339
And last time I checked, I was the
attending, and you were a fellow,

583
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:28,907
so stop overstepping, and
get the hell off my floor now!

584
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:41,239
This lesion is extending

585
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,140
all the way across David's subtroch region.

586
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:44,308
I can't believe he made it this far

587
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:45,876
without fracturing his entire femur.

588
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,244
How's the break going?

589
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,812
Meredith.

590
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:50,614
I mean, diet.

591
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:52,750
- How's the diet going?
- Diet, right.

592
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:56,687
Uh, I'm back on track, I think.

593
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,721
Day 16.

594
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:59,122
No more late-night binges?

595
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:01,391
Well, I almost had a, uh, cheeseburger,

596
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:03,626
but then I didn't, so...

597
00:25:03,661 --> 00:25:05,896
that was rough, 'cause
I like cheeseburgers.

598
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,231
Oh, God, I miss cheeseburgers.

599
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:11,374
Derek wants a cheeseburger
every single night,

600
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,937
and I tell him he can't have
one till the end of the year,

601
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,606
so he should just go
and sleep on the couch.

602
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,474
- Hm.
- You're lucky.

603
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:21,177
At least your diet has an
end date... 30 days, right?

604
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:24,246
Imagine how good that
cheeseburger's gonna taste

605
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,015
- when your diet's done.
- No.

606
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,083
- Did I go too far?
- No, no, no. Look, look.

607
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:29,819
See that inflammation?

608
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:31,587
The blood supply's completely gone.

609
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:33,322
A total hip won't survive in here.

610
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:35,090
Poor healing, crappy surgical bed,

611
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,525
his immunocompromised state...

612
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,194
It'd be infected within a week.

613
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:40,796
So, what do you want to do?

614
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:45,134
We removed the tumor along
with the necrotic bone,

615
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,136
and we completely washed out the area.

616
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,603
It was fairly inflamed,

617
00:25:48,638 --> 00:25:51,105
so we also placed
antibiotic-loaded cement spacers.

618
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,742
So, right now, he has no hip?

619
00:25:53,776 --> 00:25:56,211
How can he get out of bed or walk?

620
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:57,491
He can't.

621
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,981
That ex-fix I attached is the only thing

622
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:01,983
securing his leg in place
to the rest of his body.

623
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,876
Oh, God. Why did you...

624
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:06,654
You said that you do this all the time.

625
00:26:06,688 --> 00:26:07,788
I am so sorry.

626
00:26:07,823 --> 00:26:09,790
I didn't know how much
damage there would be

627
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:11,794
until we actually opened your husband up.

628
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:13,161
The ex-fix is only temporary.

629
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:14,963
We will find a permanent solution.

630
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:17,498
The important thing is we got the tumor,

631
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,834
and we stopped it from causing
David any more problems.

632
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,502
I need... I need to be with him.

633
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:22,837
Of course.

634
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:29,438
Oh, God, I'm having the worst month.

635
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:31,979
I know what we need.

636
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,318
Hmm?

637
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,917
Oh, you are so smart... so smart.

638
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,618
- Can't eat all of this.
- Oh, no, no.

639
00:26:38,652 --> 00:26:40,053
We'll split it.

640
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:41,464
Cheers.

641
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:43,490
Ah.

642
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:52,699
- Wait.
- What?

643
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,501
- We could split it.
- We are.

644
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:57,437
No, no, no. What if
we... What if we split it?

645
00:26:57,471 --> 00:26:59,005
If you want the whole thing,
you can have the whole thing.

646
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,008
No, the leg, the... for David,
the... Look, it's genius.

647
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:06,345
If we take his fibula bone and
we split it into two pieces,

648
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,582
we can use that to bridge the
gap from the tumor resection.

649
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:11,450
The fibula will still
have its native vessels

650
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:12,751
that we can attach.

651
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:15,121
So, you attach the pedicle
to the circumflex artery

652
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:16,989
and then core out the necrotic bone?

653
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:19,191
- You do that?
- Works for non-unions.

654
00:27:19,226 --> 00:27:20,893
I don't see why it
wouldn't work for a tumor.

655
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:22,728
- And he still gets to keep his leg?
- Yes!

656
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:23,829
Hm.

657
00:27:23,863 --> 00:27:25,531
Okay, we're gonna need more pickles.

658
00:27:36,943 --> 00:27:38,811
We broke the rules again.

659
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:40,946
- So, you had sex?
- No, no.

660
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:47,352
When she didn't come home,

661
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:49,154
I thought she was
sleeping with someone else,

662
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:52,057
which is against the rules,

663
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:55,091
and, also, the idea
really, really bugged me.

664
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:57,241
And then, when I thought,
well, if she's not doing that,

665
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,600
then what if she's not okay?

666
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,558
'Cause that bugged me more.

667
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:03,233
So, I made her talk to me.

668
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:04,936
So, I know that we're not supposed to,

669
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,170
but we still live in the same house,

670
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:07,404
so I know when you don't come home.

671
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:09,239
Okay.

672
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:11,342
And I know it's none of my
business, but there's Sofia,

673
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:13,077
and so, you know, if something
were to happen to you,

674
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:15,412
I wouldn't know where you
were or who you were with.

675
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:17,848
- I was here.
- Don't.

676
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:19,850
Okay? 'Cause I searched the
call records for your name.

677
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:22,019
- Oh, so you stalked me?
- I was worried.

678
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:24,753
I was at dinner with Grey.

679
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,189
We came up with a fix for a patient,

680
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:27,423
and we came back here to work on it.

681
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,325
- With Meredith?
- Yes. What?

682
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,027
What, you think something ha...

683
00:28:31,061 --> 00:28:34,063
I was with Meredith Grey,
and suddenly, it was 3:00 A.M.

684
00:28:34,098 --> 00:28:36,699
I didn't want to drive home,
so I slept in an on-call room.

685
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:39,987
She was jealous...

686
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:45,173
like, irrationally, obviously jealous.

687
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,643
Do you know how that feels,
to have someone be jealous,

688
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:49,812
to be worried that you're cheating?

689
00:28:49,846 --> 00:28:51,413
It feels nice.

690
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:54,550
Well, it's not the healthiest...

691
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,818
No, no, no, no, no, I just mean,
she was... she was worried about me.

692
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:58,653
She... she cared.

693
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,960
Does that mean this thing
might actually be working?

694
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:13,168
All right, just give me a few minutes,

695
00:29:13,193 --> 00:29:16,453
and I will have viable and
structurally sound bone coming your way.

696
00:29:16,473 --> 00:29:18,974
There's no sign of infection
in the subtroch region,

697
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,509
so the antibiotic spacers worked.

698
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:23,378
- How's the blood supply?
- Oh, it's freaking amazing.

699
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:26,047
All right, we'll use a portion of the
peroneal artery and its adjoining veins.

700
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:27,483
Okay, ready when you are.

701
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,984
All right, after I
finish the femoral canal,

702
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,519
we will incorporate the fibula

703
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:33,155
into a plate-and-screw
construct to span the defect.

704
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,900
And we'll do the vessel
anastomosis with an 8-0 nylon,

705
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,659
and we'll do simple, interrupted sutures.

706
00:29:37,684 --> 00:29:40,757
Then we will check for leaks and
patch any we find with fat grafts.

707
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:43,107
Hopefully, we'll have the patient
weight-bearing within a couple of weeks.

708
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:44,565
- Any questions?
- Dr. Torres.

709
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,900
- Yes?
- When you're done in here,

710
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:47,562
they're asking that you go down to the E.R.

711
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:48,641
why?

712
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:51,105
Push 50 of fentanyl.

713
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,273
What happened?

714
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:53,907
Paramedics said she ran
her car straight through

715
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:56,244
- a guard rail and into a tree.
- She's lucky to be alive.

716
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:57,411
Make it stop.

717
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:59,747
Let me die. Please, make it stop.

718
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:01,516
Did she do it on purpose?

719
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,011
Well, can't get anything out of
her right now that makes sense.

720
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:07,106
Oh, God.

721
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,143
Wait, Callie.

722
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,493
What's the story with this girl?

723
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:16,496
I repaired her arm fracture a month ago,

724
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,465
but she's still in horrible pain,

725
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:19,933
and I can't find
anything wrong with her.

726
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,334
There's nothing wrong with her.

727
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:22,836
I don't know if it's referred pain

728
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,671
- or some kind of weird phantom limb, but...
- Okay, listen.

729
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:26,173
I think she just tried to kill herself.

730
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:27,807
And don't tell me it's not
my fault, because it is.

731
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:28,908
It's my fault.

732
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:30,510
It's my fault that I can't stop the pain.

733
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:31,611
Stop.

734
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,382
There, see? You see that?

735
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,217
Those teeny things? Barely.

736
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:38,685
They're fluid-filled cysts.

737
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:41,187
Emily's arm injury ripped the
nerves from her spinal cord,

738
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:43,944
causing her to develop spinal epilepsy.

739
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,758
Instead of having seizures,
she develops these...

740
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:47,326
Shocks of pain.

741
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,662
- Is there any way to...
- Fix it? Yeah. It's risky.

742
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,463
I have to burn the nerve
endings of her spine

743
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:53,632
to stop the communication of
the pain signals to her arm.

744
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,367
Oh. Can you do it?

745
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,766
Are you kidding me?

746
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:00,306
So...

747
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,874
Addison Montgomery with a toddler.

748
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,176
Oh, yeah.

749
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:07,045
Henry has completely destroyed
her white walls and carpets.

750
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,514
He's currently into drawing

751
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:11,684
and spilling and smearing.

752
00:31:11,718 --> 00:31:13,218
Yeah, well, looks like we won't see her

753
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:14,686
on the conference circuit
for a little while.

754
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:16,788
Um, I didn't know that
you knew Addison, too.

755
00:31:16,823 --> 00:31:17,889
Did you finish rounding?

756
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:19,257
Yes.

757
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,026
Um, yeah. I wanted to tell you

758
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,894
that Ms. Cain gave consent
to her valvuloplasty.

759
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:25,663
- Um, should I schedule it?
- Yeah. Day after next.

760
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:27,665
And you're leading this one, Robbins.

761
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,267
Graham will assist and hold the needles.

762
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:31,527
I'll observe. You be ready this time.

763
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:32,852
Yes, ma'am.

764
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:37,788
Did you need something else?

765
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:41,186
No.

766
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:46,323
- So, Henry... that's a cute name, though.
- It's cute.

767
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,694
Hey, um, how's he doing?

768
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:51,429
Can I see the most recent gapogram?

769
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:53,898
Uh, I'm not sure that I should.

770
00:31:56,134 --> 00:31:57,435
I'm leaving, okay?

771
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:58,936
It's your... your patient, your NICU,

772
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,406
your territory, so I'm gone.

773
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:07,211
Okay, the cord's exposed.

774
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:10,080
I'm about to send down
the radiofrequency probe.

775
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:13,417
I never even thought to
look past the arm, and now

776
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,920
I may have blown her
chances at culinary school...

777
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:17,905
gotten her hooked on pain meds, to boot.

778
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:19,589
It's not your fault.

779
00:32:19,624 --> 00:32:21,525
No, this... this problem goes much deeper

780
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,728
than anything you could have
seen or could have controlled.

781
00:32:24,762 --> 00:32:26,663
It's not your fault at all.

782
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:14,943
- Calliope. I...
- Shh.

783
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:18,080
I need... I need to practice.

784
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:20,015
No talking.

785
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,249
Rules.

786
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:30,291
Tomorrow's the last day.

787
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:34,261
- So? Close enough, right?
- Yeah.

788
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:36,798
Oh, what if she makes us start over again?

789
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:38,600
So, what if we don't tell her?

790
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,869
Oh.

791
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,421
Hey, um, I just got your page.

792
00:33:53,456 --> 00:33:55,457
I thought the Cain valvuloplasty
was scheduled for tomorrow.

793
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,851
It was.

794
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:58,626
Ultrasound showed mild fetal hydrops.

795
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,562
So not only does it have to happen today...

796
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:01,830
It has to happen right now.

797
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:04,911
You ready?

798
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:09,370
Ready.

799
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:11,305
Needle, please?

800
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:19,903
Stop.

801
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:21,982
What's wrong?

802
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,183
I should be asking you that.

803
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:25,251
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

804
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:26,353
You hesitated.

805
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:27,821
You steadied your hand. I watched you.

806
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:28,956
No, no, I'm fine.

807
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,457
- Are you nervous?
- No.

808
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:32,158
I mean... of course I am, but...

809
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:34,695
Why? Why are you nervous?
Are you well-rested?

810
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:37,230
- Yes, Dr. Herman.
- But you're prepared, right?

811
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:38,531
You studied the fetal echo,

812
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:39,866
you memorized the measurements,

813
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,167
you practiced the angles?

814
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:43,103
Do you know exactly how
far to insert the needle,

815
00:34:43,137 --> 00:34:45,405
at which point to deploy the
wire, inflate the balloon?

816
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:47,374
- I do. I think I...
- Do you think, or you know?

817
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:49,509
I know. I know. I know!

818
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:53,613
Graham, trade places with Robbins.

819
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,014
Absolutely.

820
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:57,216
- Dr. Herman, I...
- It's fine.

821
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,619
We've just lost some valuable time.

822
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,262
- Hi.
- Hi.

823
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:12,031
- Where you been?
- Vacation.

824
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:17,736
Right in here is fine.

825
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,420
Oh. Hi.

826
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:23,075
Let me just explain.

827
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:24,543
Do you know how many
fetal surgeons there are

828
00:35:24,577 --> 00:35:26,077
west of the Mississippi river?

829
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:28,146
Five. There are five of us.

830
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,749
And I need a sixth,
Robbins, so I picked you.

831
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:33,451
Out of everyone, I handpicked you.

832
00:35:33,485 --> 00:35:35,787
And you are letting me down.

833
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:37,442
I'm not just questioning your abilities.

834
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:39,223
Now I'm questioning mine.

835
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,127
I thought you had something.

836
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:42,719
I thought you were special.

837
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,679
You're the chief of pediatric surgery.

838
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:47,765
You're a member of the board,
well-respected among peers.

839
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:50,601
I thought you would be
better and in less time.

840
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:53,471
But today? Today, you embarrassed me.

841
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:56,974
Today, you were unprepared
for the second time.

842
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:58,876
So I might have to rethink this,

843
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,178
because you might not
have what it takes here.

844
00:36:01,212 --> 00:36:02,646
I don't know what's wrong with you.

845
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:04,347
I don't know what kind of demons you have.

846
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:07,517
But I can tell you that you
are behind in this fellowship,

847
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,820
and I don't have time for you to catch up.

848
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:12,321
I don't have time for three strikes.

849
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:16,493
Something like this
happens again, you're out.

850
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:29,046
- Any pain?
- No.

851
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,074
It's all gone.

852
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:32,174
What about your arm?

853
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,843
Nothing.

854
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,861
When my car hit that tree,

855
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,413
the first thought that
came into my head was,

856
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,989
"at least it's over"... no more pain,

857
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,383
no more swallowing a bunch of pills,

858
00:36:46,408 --> 00:36:48,076
trying to make it stop,

859
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:50,069
no more crying on my couch

860
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:52,996
watching those stupid,
cheesy cooking shows,

861
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,331
thinking about food I'd never make.

862
00:36:55,365 --> 00:36:58,567
And, God, stop feeling sorry for myself.

863
00:37:00,903 --> 00:37:02,063
Thank you.

864
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:07,241
I finally feel like I
might actually survive this.

865
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:18,928
That's all you, you know.

866
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:23,691
Well, he's got a tough road
ahead... months of P.T... but

867
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,860
that graft should last him for years.

868
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:27,762
Hopefully, this is the
beginning of the end for him.

869
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:29,997
So, what about you? It's day 30, isn't it?

870
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,832
It is.

871
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:33,501
Day 30.

872
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:36,604
Uh, I am... Weirdly nervous.

873
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,007
I mean, I feel good, but I... I don't know.

874
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,009
It feels like coming back from somewhere.

875
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:43,744
Well, even though the diet's over,

876
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:45,913
I'm always up for
cheeseburgers and tequila.

877
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,181
Oh.

878
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:48,983
Actual cheeseburgers.

879
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,619
Once the chaos subsides,

880
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,021
we have to go back...

881
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:57,757
take another look.

882
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:00,644
We have to ask ourselves...

883
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,700
can this body be put back together?

884
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:09,403
We were able to put Lee's
esophagus back together,

885
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,504
and I assure you, it's stronger than ever.

886
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:14,583
Thank you so much.

887
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:20,013
If we've done our jobs right, it can.

888
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,546
We stop the bleeding.

889
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:27,146
We sew up the damage.

890
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:31,156
We make the body whole again.

891
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:40,132
I understand why we did this.

892
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:44,236
You know, it was to make us
stronger, to make us better.

893
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,308
And it did.

894
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,100
I mean, I feel like it really did.

895
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:50,408
It took a long time,

896
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,218
and it was painful, and it sucked,

897
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,950
but... we've come a long way.

898
00:38:57,984 --> 00:39:00,917
And I know that we have
further to go, but...

899
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:04,137
I love you, Calliope.

900
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:05,859
I love you.

901
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:10,395
Life without you terrifies me.

902
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:13,865
And the world is just
making less and less sense,

903
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:16,300
and, like, I don't know what
I'm doing at work anymore,

904
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:19,270
but the thing that I need is my anchor.

905
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:20,437
It's you.

906
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:22,259
I need you.

907
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,509
And you're the only thing
that I will ever need.

908
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:30,681
And I'm so glad that this break is over.

909
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:52,602
The last 30 days have taught me so much.

910
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:56,206
And all I wanted when we first came here

911
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,574
was to know that we would leave together.

912
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:03,713
But from the minute I
sat down, I could feel it.

913
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:05,961
I felt like I was gonna be suffocated.

914
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:17,356
The last several weeks,

915
00:40:18,562 --> 00:40:21,464
I have laughed more, I have done more,

916
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:24,900
I have enjoyed myself more, than...

917
00:40:27,503 --> 00:40:29,839
And I finally feel free.

918
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:35,356
And by being free,

919
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:39,614
I can see now that
constantly trying to fix us

920
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:42,217
is the thing that's been killing me slowly.

921
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:47,723
And I don't want to do it anymore.

922
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:50,525
I don't want to fix it or fix us anymore.

923
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:57,065
Maybe instead of loving
you so hard, I should...

924
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:01,435
I should be myself for a while.

925
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,529
I should love me,

926
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:08,776
and you should love you,

927
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,179
and together we love Sofia, rather than...

928
00:41:20,589 --> 00:41:23,176
I want so much for you, Arizona.

929
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:26,694
For both of us.

930
00:41:29,397 --> 00:41:31,765
So much more than this.

931
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:36,636
More than being stuck with
someone who feels stuck.

932
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,610
I want you to feel free, too.

933
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:55,455
But no matter how hard we try...

934
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:07,399
We have to realize...

935
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:16,319
Some things...

936
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,677
Just can't be fixed.

937
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:27,430
