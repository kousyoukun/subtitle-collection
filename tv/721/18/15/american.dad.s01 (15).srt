1
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,527
Wanted a pool filed with cherryJell-O.

2
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,730
Well, in the end,
l got it.

3
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,467
I got a lot ofthings
on my rise to stardom-

4
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,543
Women, respect...

5
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,010
thatjoke about
the 1 0-inch pianist.

6
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,081
I can 't believe
l never got that before.

7
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:53,585
And I can't believe this all
began just a few weeks ago.

8
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,515
Stars-
they're just I i ke us.

9
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,684
Oh, here's T ara Reid
buying a gallon ofvodka...

10
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,762
and a case
of morning-after pills.

11
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,695
I drink gallons ofvodka!
I should be a star!

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,767
Ah, what a good
night's rest.

13
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,926
I had that wonderful
recurring dream where...

14
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,630
I'm giving a lecture naked,
and I'm a resounding success.

15
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,072
Now, how about a kiss? Good God, Francine!
Your roots are showing!

16
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,144
I know. My hairdresser...

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,838
Iost his touch
when he decided he was straight.

18
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,915
- Apparently, it is a choice.
- Yes, it is.

19
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:27,680
Absolutely. Anyway, the only good
hairdresser left is Mr. Beauregard.

20
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,915
But it's impossible to get an appointment
unless you know somebody.

21
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,585
Butyou do know somebody, Francine.
You know Roger.

22
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,662
Oh, wait.
He's just a nobody.

23
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:42,326
Don't cry in front ofthe fish.

24
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,069
Morning, Steve.
I packed your favorite lunch, P.B. and J.

25
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:52,736
With the crusts cut off
and cherryJell-O!

26
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,747
Someday I'd like to have
a swimming pool...

27
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,976
filled with cherryJell-O.

28
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,986
Anyway, Dad...

29
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,282
my English teacher, Mr. Durban,
is your biggest fan.

30
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,290
- Can I getyour autograph for him.
- Sure.

31
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,259
"To Mr. Durban. Keep on rockin'.
Yours in Christ."

32
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,592
Dad, that's Steve's
report card.

33
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,065
- What?

34
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,636
What doyou know?
And I'm getting straight A's.

35
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,399
Well, that's great, sweetheart.
Congratulations.

36
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,742
Hey, it's been a while.

37
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,641
Steve, how could you
be failing English?

38
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,714
It's not my fault.
My teacher hates me.

39
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,806
Hates you, huh?

40
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:35,820
Well, perhaps I need to pay
Mr. Durban a little visit.

41
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,890
Well, what a nice visit.

42
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,016
Oh, Mr. Durban,
the pleasure was all mine.

43
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,560
And thanks, Lynn,
for the delicious maple scones.

44
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,630
Can we have
another pony ride?

45
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,758
Oh-ho, no. This old horse
has to get back to the stable.

46
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,001
Oh, uh, Mr. Durban.
I almost forgot. I wanted to askyou-

47
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,075
- Why do you hate my son?

48
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,644
- Shut up! Don't look at me!

49
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,407
Get on the floor!
You, get me more maple scones!

50
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,845
Why are you failing my son?
Answer me, dirtbag!

51
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,979
He had his Japanese friend
do his writing assignment. Look.

52
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,691
Oh, I see.
Well, good night.

53
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,353
Good night, Lynn.
Oh, don't get up, kids.

54
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,124
Seriously, stare at the floor
and count to a hundred!

55
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,395
Go ahead, Eric.
Be a hero.

56
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,130
That's what I thought,
punk ass.

57
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,101
- What?

58
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,408
- I mean, why'd you cheat?
- I'm sorry.

59
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,541
It's just creative writing is hard.
I can't do it.

60
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,142
"Can't"? We don't live
in "Ameri-can't," Steve.

61
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,279
We live in America. No.

62
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,448
No, no. No, wait.
We live in American.

63
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,322
No, wait. That's not right.
We are American.

64
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,396
Where-Where was
l goin' with this?

65
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,464
Um, I said
creative writing is hard.

66
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,864
Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, perseverance, Steve.
It's all about perseverance.

67
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,029
And ifl "Ameri-can't"
teach you about it...

68
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,766
I have a friend
who "Ameri-will."

69
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,571
Well, that sounded good. Had a bumpy
start there, but I think I pulled it together.

70
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,374
Steve, meet Patriot Pigeon.

71
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,449
You wrote
a children's book?

72
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,246
No, Steve, I wrote
3,01 2 children's books.

73
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,583
Each chronicling the adventures
of Patriot Pigeon...

74
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,920
who battles America's enemies by dropping
red, white and blue turds ofjustice.

75
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,688
Wow! So how many ofyour books
have been published?

76
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:27,630
None. See that? That's over 1 0,000
rejection letters and counting.

77
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,702
- Gosh. I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

78
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,761
You see, Steve, true success isn't about
getting recognition or fame.

79
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,341
It's about never giving up.
So what doyou say?

80
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,467
Have I inspired you
to do that writing assignment?

81
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,274
- No.
- How about now?

82
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,145
- That's the hand I write with.
- That's negative thinking.

83
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,411
Hey, how about a story
where a boy's hand...

84
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,113
is glued to a table and he
slowly starves to death?

85
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,690
That's good stuff.
Thanks,J.C.

86
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,460
Aw, I don't know
what to write about.

87
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,019
Aw, I'm never
gonna be a star.

88
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,101
People are never gonna see me
in Us Weekly and say...

89
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:07,104
"Ooh, Roger...
picks up a vase just like us."

90
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,939
- Ooh, Roger drops expensive vases just like us.

91
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,572
Oh, Roger-
Roger starts to black out just like-

92
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,558
- Oh, Mr. Beauregard, I feel born anew.

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,858
Well, of course you do, darlin'.
I use genuine human placenta.

94
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,932
That's where
it gets its luster.

95
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,025
Mr. Beauregard,
l- I would love foryou...

96
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,627
to put expelled uterine matter
in my hair.

97
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:45,243
Hmm! Ifl wereyou, I'd takeyour hair
behind the shed and shoot it.

98
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,677
- Ride, Montague.

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,812
Anything for me?

100
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,686
Just a postcard that says
your hair looks like crap.

101
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,453
Hey, it's from me.
What's this?

102
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,689
"P and QPublishing."
Oh, good. Another rejection letter.

103
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,731
"Dear, Mr. Smith.

104
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,599
It is with great pleasure that we
have decided to publish your book."

105
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,230
- What's goin' on?
- I'm gonna be published! Oh, glorious day!

106
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,900
All those wasted years ofwriting
finally have meaning.

107
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,375
What about all that stuff
about not needing recognition?

108
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,538
Oh, that's what people say
when they're dead inside.

109
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,413
Now, let's see which one of my
Patriot Pigeon books they're publishing.

110
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,486
"Roger the Alien"?

111
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,851
- Hey, that's the story I wrote for English.
- What?

112
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,151
You wrote a story about me?

113
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,991
I'll take that, Dad. Huh. Mr. Durban said
he was gonna submit my story to a publisher.

114
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,964
So, it's not Patriot Pigeon
Poops on Planned Parenthood?

115
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,501
A book about me?

116
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,265
I'm gonna be a star!
Steve, you're the best!

117
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,932
Oh, my God, Stan!
How upset are you?

118
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,373
Seriously, on a scale
from one to pissed?

119
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,241
Oh, who gives a flying fig?
I'm a star!

120
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,251
So now I was a published writer.

121
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,652
But mylife
had become boring.

122
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,190
As boring as a bad metaphor...
or a simile.

123
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,260
Whatever,
I'm not a writer.

124
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,329
Got any ti ps
for a young author?

125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,398
Oh, I don't
want to be recorded.

126
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,932
No, it's inspiring music
to accompanyyour answer.

127
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,936
Um, just write something
and it'll get published.

128
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,269
It's easy.
Any idiot can do it.

129
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,400
It's not fair, Francine.

130
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,445
I write 3,000 books and-
Ugh!

131
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,439
I write 3,000 books and nobody's
ever asked me for an autograph.

132
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,020
Don'tyou see, Stan?
You're Steve's father.

133
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,351
He couldn't have done
any ofthis withoutyou.

134
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,425
And people are
gonna know that.

135
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,323
Yes. Yes, people
are gonna know that.

136
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,919
Hey, everyone,
I'm Steve's father!

137
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,558
He came from my seed!
And she was the manure.

138
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,703
Ugh! Francine, when I
look at your hair...

139
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,170
I doubt I could eat the amount
l want to vomit.

140
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,040
The turnout at today's
book signing was awful...

141
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,113
and I blameyou,
publisher man.

142
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,809
Actually, it's "Publisherman."
Bill Publisherman.

143
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,683
Dad, it's okay. I'm not into this
whole book thing anyway.

144
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,222
Nonsense! You and I are
gonna be big.

145
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,792
- We're gonna be huge.
-Just how big areyou talking?

146
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,453
"Ginormagantuan."

147
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,233
Well, then whatyou need is to get Steve
on Cap'n Monty's Book Cavalcade...

148
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,499
the hottest children's
book show in Langley Falls.

149
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,598
- Great! Put him on.
- I'd love to.

150
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,701
But to get on, he needs to have
the number-one children's book in town.

151
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,780
And to get that,
he'll need a hook.

152
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,974
Right. We'll cut off
one ofhis hands.

153
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,177
People love the disfigured...
and fear them.

154
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,551
No, a hook,
an angle, a gimmick.

155
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,454
Hmm.
Is the boy gay?

156
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,823
- Why? Could that be a hook?
- Hook?

157
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,831
- Ah, a hook, a hook, a hook.

158
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,335
No.

159
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,837
Is it true? Were there really seven people
at the book signing?

160
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,103
- Oh, my God! It's happening for me.

161
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,405
I'm almost a star.
Oh! There's my cell phone.

162
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,480
Oh, my God!
It's Johnny Depp.

163
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,550
- Deppster! What's shakin'?
- That's not a cell phone.

164
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,212
- That's a bar of soapyou painted black.
- Yeah, hang on,J.D.

165
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,189
Watch it, Klaus, or I'm gonna cram
this bad boy 20,000 leagues upyour butt.

166
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,556
"Bad boy"?
Steve, that's it!

167
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,357
- You can be the bad boy of children's books.
- Huh?

168
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,624
Sure, sure.
The media loves bad boys.

169
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,565
- Your bookwill fly offthe shelves.
- I don't know.

170
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,161
Look, Son, you do this for me,
and I'll use my C.I.A. powers...

171
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,264
to getyou centerfold
Janet Gustafson.

172
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,368
- She's beautiful.
- And she loves the bad boys.

173
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:45,007
Mydark descent all the wayto the top.

174
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,689
Franci ne, I cannot let
the mother of...

175
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,459
Langley Falls' legendary bad-boy
author look like this.

176
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,094
Shame on you.
Scoot on in here, girl.

177
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,970
Oh, my God! Is it here?

178
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,566
You're so adorable.

179
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,478
- Give me sillyjuice and watch me fall down.
- What the-

180
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,244
I'm ugly
and my butt is huge.

181
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,013
I- I- I don't-
l don't get it.

182
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:59,524
They areyour catch phrases.
Roger, haveyou even read Steve's book?

183
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,616
You bastard!

184
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,718
Roger the clumsy alien!

185
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,356
Rogerwho sips his sillyjuice
and goes on delusional rants!

186
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,764
And it's not sillyjuice!
It's necessaryjuice!

187
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,928
Watch your back.

188
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,872
Ouch! Oh, that-
Ouchies, ouchies, ouch.

189
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,001
You bastard!

190
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,375
Thanks toyou, Dad spent
all my college money...

191
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,448
buying you Doctor Seuss's
first typewriter.

192
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,540
[ Gears Whirring,
Bells Ringing ]

193
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,755
You bastard!

194
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,483
That's what I said
to my old ugly hairdo.

195
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,287
What's wrong, honey?

196
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,362
Aw, I hate being
a famous author.

197
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,488
Do I really have
to go on Cap'n Monty's?

198
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:44,262
- Oh. Well, no. I suppose not.
- Thanks, Mom.

199
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,565
Oh, Steve,
just curious.

200
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,833
- When did you stop loving Mommy?
- What?

201
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,705
'Cause ifyou loved me,
you wouldn't want me to have ugly hair.

202
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,302
But do whatever
makes you happy.

203
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,577
I have to go put some ointment on that
hideous cesarean scar I have because ofyou.

204
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,675
But Hayleywas
the cesarean.

205
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,688
Oh, that's right. With you, I just tore
from my "V" to my "A."

206
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,758
Good night.

207
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,192
As myfamily usedandabused me.

208
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,060
But at least there were two headlights
at the end ofthe tunnel.

209
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,133
Now do I get to meet
that centerfold?

210
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,328
No. I just said that to motivate you
so you'd carry me to the top.

211
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,735
Dad, I can't believe
you lied to me.

212
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,105
Really? Huh.
That's-That's kind of mywhole bit.

213
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,872
Hey, my first green room.

214
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:31,177
It isn't even green!

215
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,684
Steve. Kevin Broham,
DudemeisterManagement. Huge fan.

216
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,312
So, how does it feel
to be a superstar?

217
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,391
Well, I-
l kind of hate it.

218
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,451
Let me guess. Your family's bustin'
your boy bag like a bunch of gonad gangsters.

219
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,530
How did you know?

220
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,600
Bro, I see families exploiting
the talented dude all the time.

221
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,898
I feel so trapped.
I don't know what to do.

222
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,810
Good morn', mateys.

223
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,608
Today, Captain Monty
sails his fairvessel...

224
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,343
with precious cargo-

225
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,477
Child prodigy,
and most likely...

226
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:12,717
ninth incarnation
ofthe Buddha, Steve Smith.

227
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,287
- Yeah!
- Yea!

228
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,092
Boo!

229
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,167
Steve.

230
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,463
Steve Smith.

231
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,097
Even the name
recalls simplicity, elegance.

232
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,234
Steve, welcome.

233
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,780
Steve, I'm not going to askyou
about your influences...

234
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,849
oryour process.

235
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,148
In fact, I'm not going
to askyou any questions.

236
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,916
I am going to
tell you something.

237
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,992
And that something is...

238
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,323
you, Steve Smith,
are a genius.

239
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,832
A "geeeeenius."

240
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,902
Argh.

241
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,903
Steve, I will askyou
one question.

242
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,166
I know I said
no questions.

243
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,834
I'm flawed, unlikeyou,
Steve Smith.

244
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,344
Tell me...

245
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,846
whom would you like
to thank foryour success?

246
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,315
Here it comes, clown.

247
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,386
Well, Captain Monty...

248
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,455
I'd like to thank
my new manager Kevin...

249
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,650
for helping me fill out the paperwork
to divorce my parents.

250
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,456
- And the shoes. I want the shoes.

251
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,531
Slowly, pretty boy.

252
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,624
Yeah, you're
a pretty boy...

253
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,965
with a pretty
pair of shoes.

254
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,306
The court ruled in myfavor...

255
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,174
and I was finally
free ofmyparents.

256
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,113
Did the book make me
rich and popular? Yeah.

257
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,185
Did it all go to my head?

258
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,449
Oh, yeah. Did I start talking
like Robert Evans?

259
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,524
You bet your ass I did.

260
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,593
Did I even know
who Robert Evans was?

261
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,254
- Not by a long shot.
- Franci ne. Stan.

262
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,332
Stop this nonsense, Steve.

263
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,333
Dude, his name is S now.
And S does what S wants.

264
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,302
And S wants
to C-L-T-D-F-H-C.

265
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,167
Cut loose the deadweight
from his coattails.

266
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,244
There should be
a "W" in there.

267
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,312
Get in the trunk, Barry.

268
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,220
All right. But I didn't miss them.

269
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,451
I was too busy tending to mystately
pleasure dome, Steveadoo.

270
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,050
I had rooms filled with
the finest antiquities.

271
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,528
Rooms devoted
to girl-on-girl action.

272
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,239
Sci nti I lati ng.

273
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,039
In my "I don't need any family"room.

274
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,170
And the coup de grâce...

275
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,512
mypool filled
with cherryJell-O.

276
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,849
Mmm, success.

277
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,852
Oh! That I ittle creep
is I ivi ng the star I ifestyle I deserve.

278
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,658
Well, he's gonna learn that he's messing
with the wrong muchacho.

279
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,291
Ow! Ow! Stubbed my toe! Stubbed my toe!
Stubbed my toe! Stubbed my toe!

280
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,369
Worst part's over. Worst part's over.
Worst part's over.

281
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,868
- What are you doing here?
- I want you to come home.

282
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,708
Yeah? Well, you can forget it.
You used me and you lied to me.

283
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,612
Guilty as charged. But I'm gonna
make good on it all.

284
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,185
Starting with that centerfold
l promised you.

285
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,414
Here she is,
centerfold Janet Gustafson.

286
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,918
That's not her!
She's ancient.

287
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,190
Well, sure. The magazine
l showed you was from 1 957.

288
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,390
But she still
loves to party.

289
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,679
This is your idea
ofan apology?

290
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,748
Sulu, Chekov!

291
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,565
Hello, old friend.

292
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,532
Hopeyou don't
mind me dropping by...

293
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,263
to kill you.

294
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:26,100
Strange. This window
shouldn't be open.

295
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,543
And this window
shouldn't be closed.

296
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,775
Aw, this should
all be mine.

297
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,854
I mean, not this
color scheme. P.U.

298
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,388
But everything else
should be mi- Oh, God!

299
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,458
This bust of Ben Stiller
is hideous.

300
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,527
But it should be mine!

301
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,363
Bravo! Thatwas the gumball machine
Henry Ford gave to Hitler.

302
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,700
- S, we didn't do it.
- Yeah, right.

303
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,936
You're all just a bunch ofusers
like my parents. Get out! All ofyou!

304
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,989
Guess I'll be cutting the crusts off
my own sandwiches from now on.

305
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,367
Great. Who tracked mud
on my floor?

306
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,508
Hey, your knife goes real well
with my novelty alien hand.

307
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,647
And how great is my new
horror-movie ring tone?

308
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,155
- Dude, where'd you go?

309
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,250
- Well, come into the kitchen.
- What up?

310
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,023
S, meet Spike Baltar.

311
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,224
Spike Baltar,
you're my favorite actor.

312
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,301
Wow, you look
just like me.

313
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,665
That's because he's gonna playyou
in the movie version...

314
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,738
of RogertheAlien,
and he's totally method.

315
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,606
- Wow, I'm so happy I could die.

316
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,407
- It's me. I gotta take this.

317
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,649
Yeah, the kid's
a total douche.

318
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,718
And his voice-

319
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,787
I'm Steve Smith.

320
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,856
I wrote RogertheAlien.

321
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,118
I'm Steve Smith.
I was never molested...

322
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,990
on the set of a mustard commercial
when I was nine.

323
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,530
- Die, dream stealer!

324
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,767
Oh, my God! I-
l killed Steve.

325
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:45,112
- Hombre, what's the matter?
- It's just I kinda miss my family.

326
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,617
"Bro-sickle,"
I'm your family now...

327
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,187
and this dude is never ever
gonna leaveyou.

328
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,257
Never.

329
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,325
Spike Baltar's
dead in your pool.

330
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,394
You're finished.
I'm out ofhere.

331
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,901
I'm comin', Steve!
I'm comin'!

332
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,992
I didn't mean
to kill you!

333
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,071
- Roger?

334
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,504
That's not me in the pool.
That's Spike Baltar.

335
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,009
Wait. You were trying to kill me?
So this is all your fault.

336
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,239
Oh, yeah. Blame the alien.
The cops will eat that up.

337
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,316
Sorry, pal,
you're goin' to jail...

338
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,578
where they're gonna
takeyour cherry...

339
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,621
Jell-O... away...

340
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,656
in the lunch line...

341
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,453
afteryou're raped...
in the shower.

342
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,994
Well, this is where ourstorystarted.

343
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,360
Onlythe dead kid isn't me.

344
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,161
That was kind ofa screw

345
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,203
Ifit makes you feel any better,
l was drowning all right-

346
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,272
In a sea oftroubles.

347
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,467
And there was only
one place I could turn.

348
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,703
I t's good to have you back,
Steve.

349
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,872
I t sure is. And I 'm sorry
l pushed you so hard.

350
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,510
From now on, the only thing I want
recognition for is being a good dad. Ready?

351
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,317
- One, two, heave!

352
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,827
Au revoir, stardom.

353
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,462
- Oh, did I tie that to Steve's ankle?

354
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,660
Guess I'm clumsy
like he wrote in the book.

355
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,000
How doyou like
that ending, Steve?

356
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,038
Bye!
Have a great time!
