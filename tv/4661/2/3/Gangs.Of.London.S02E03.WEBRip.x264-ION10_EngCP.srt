1
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:42,049
Alex, cover your mouth!

2
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:43,968
- Let's go.
- Move, move, move, move!

3
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,427
Armed police!

4
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,024
Armed police! Get down!

5
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:02,298
Sean Wallace is dead.

6
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:06,516
I repeat, Sean Wallace...

7
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,313
Here, help me.

8
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,072
Clear.

9
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:30,004
Get him in the van!

10
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:35,281
Clear.

11
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,119
Is he dead?

12
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:42,237
He's breathing. Drive.

13
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,634
Hurry.

14
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:51,012
Take the left.

15
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:08,243
Defibrillator.

16
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:11,862
Charging. Clear. Shock.

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,100
Okay, we have him.
He's in a bad way...

18
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:23,646
Sutures in place. Entering now.

19
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:15,317
Where am I?

20
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,694
We would like your cooperation

21
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:25,832
concerning a group
you call the Investors.

22
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:30,429
You would be rewarded.

23
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:35,346
You work for them?

24
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:40,823
The opposite.

25
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,699
You're not the police.

26
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,458
A version of it.

27
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:57,405
Well, then... fuck off.

28
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:34,165
Fuck you!

29
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,351
Get up!

30
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,119
Tell me about last night.
The fish market.

31
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:50,046
One shooter. Male. Thirties.

32
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:53,114
Maybe professional?

33
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,832
Not very.

34
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,070
You saw his face, yes?

35
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,267
No?

36
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,276
- Perhaps you...
- It was Billy Wallace.

37
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:11,384
Sean's brother.

38
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,301
Sean's brother?

39
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,799
- Can you explain?
- I don't fucking know.

40
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:25,097
You asked me to find a shooter,
and I did.

41
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:32,454
Where did you go after? Hm?

42
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,709
Where does Elliot go
after he helps kill Billy Wallace?

43
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:44,267
Breakfast.

44
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,456
Breakfast.

45
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:48,184
- Breakfast.
- Hm.

46
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:52,664
You know, toast.
Some herbal tea.

47
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:57,041
Mm. Mm. Mm.

48
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:02,677
I understand.

49
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:08,705
You're like
a secret fucking agent.

50
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:15,552
Who knows where you go...
what you really see?

51
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:38,001
You see any more Wallaces
out there... you let me know.

52
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:43,927
Hm? Or I'll think you don't like me.

53
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,758
Billy.

54
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:22,025
Take these.

55
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:37,008
Thanks.

56
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,684
Who were those shooters
last night?

57
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,723
You walked into something.

58
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:47,142
Yeah, no shit.
Have I said thanks?

59
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,101
I'm not losing you both, Billy.

60
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:59,177
- Yeah, Mum told me.
- Yeah...

61
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,454
Were you following me?

62
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:07,852
No. Following someone else.
You were just lucky.

63
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,090
The guy at the fish market,
the hit, that was you?

64
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,707
What the fuck is going on, Sean?

65
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:21,255
In the car, you said one of the men
you came with went missing.

66
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,363
One of Mum's men.

67
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:29,901
Yeah. Darragh.

68
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,259
He went to Luan. I don't...

69
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,257
I need to speak to Mum.

70
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:36,356
She in trouble?

71
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,430
She'll have some questions.

72
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,627
Your clothes are there.

73
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:03,603
Darragh and Killian are still missing.
Luan's gone silent.

74
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:06,101
- Koba's got to someone.
- And Billy?

75
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,919
- We had a deal, Marian.
- Lennie's on his way back.

76
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:14,057
- You said you could protect us.
- We're leaving.

77
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,114
Or you can just run off
to your yacht

78
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:19,953
and wait for them
to track you down.

79
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,992
Just make sure you leave money.

80
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:25,151
If I wanted, I would have done it
a long time ago.

81
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:29,769
Finn's money will always attract
attention. You know this.

82
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:33,567
I know what war is, Marian.
I lived through one.

83
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:39,264
If we hide now, we hit them hard next.
We don't back down.

84
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:41,382
Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

85
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,741
I saved your life, and in exchange
we promised each other

86
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,459
power and strength.

87
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,898
Do you remember
agreeing to that?

88
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:52,796
She won't have the life I had.

89
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,934
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

90
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:59,653
Roze. Roze.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

91
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,611
We all have plans for them.

92
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,710
Then they grow up,
punch you in the face.

93
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:09,148
Lennie's back. Get your things.

94
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:17,043
Anything from Billy?

95
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:19,982
I'll track every step he took.
I'll find him, I swear.

96
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:27,818
Billy?

97
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,925
No, Mum. It's me.

98
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,292
Who is this?

99
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,170
It's Sean, Mum.

100
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:46,008
It's Sean.

101
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,475
I can't explain now.
You need to listen to me.

102
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:55,643
Billy's safe.

103
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,221
And you need
to get out of there.

104
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Koba's coming for you.

105
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:08,356
Mum? Mum?

106
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:13,634
Mum, are you there?
Speak to me, Mum.

107
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:17,012
Mum, can you hear me?
You're in danger!

108
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:19,111
Mum, you're in danger!

109
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:04,487
I have to get Roze!

110
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:21,398
Roze!

111
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:27,206
Roze's upstairs!
I have to get her!

112
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,374
Come on, quick. That's it.
Get up, that's it!

113
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:35,333
That's it, stay here. Stay here.
Stay there. Stay down.

114
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,228
- No!
- Roze.

115
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:48,035
Pah, pah, pah.
Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah.

116
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:51,323
Roze. Roze. Roze.

117
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,778
Roze!

118
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,274
Did you find her yet?

119
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,493
Not yet, still looking.

120
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:37,038
Roze, shh, shh.

121
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,730
Come on. Floriana, get up.
Get up, come on.

122
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,889
- We've got to get out of here.
- Oh, Roze.

123
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,988
Come on. Come on.

124
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,015
- Give her to me.
- Here.

125
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:19,277
Lennie? Lennie?

126
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:27,672
No, no. Run! I've got this.

127
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,770
- Go! Go!
- Run.

128
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:34,128
To the woods, out back.

129
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:57,237
Fuck you, Marian. Fuck you.

130
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:04,692
Are they with you yet?

131
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,791
Not yet.

132
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:10,789
I'm looking.

133
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,466
Call me when you have them.

134
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:21,223
I see them.

135
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,905
Guard!

136
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:35,695
You would like me to testify
before a British court...

137
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:41,122
on everything I know
about the Investors.

138
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,980
You would have
the full protection of the state.

139
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:49,438
Your evidence
would be anonymous.

140
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,716
You'd be a ghost.

141
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:55,065
Afterwards, a new life.

142
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:58,973
With certain restrictions.

143
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,710
And you think that will remove
the Investors from London?

144
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:08,307
With what's in your head,

145
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:11,126
we'll hit them harder
than they've ever been hit.

146
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:14,844
Well, you're fucking stupid.

147
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:20,562
If you want them gone,
you have to take what they control.

148
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:27,239
Street by street.
Gang by gang. Tower by tower.

149
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,985
You'd have to destroy them
from the ground up.

150
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:37,433
You need... a returning king.

151
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,060
You blew up your father's city.
Now you want to be him.

152
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:07,896
You're not as clever
as you think you are.

153
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:18,252
The people who wanted
Sean Wallace dead...

154
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,349
you've only just
brushed up against them.

155
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:27,407
I've been on this for years.

156
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:34,323
The city's changed.
The Investors have a new player.

157
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,800
They won't see me coming.
Like you said, I'm a ghost.

158
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:48,146
I'll need people from my world.
A gang.

159
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:55,271
Where is she?

160
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,389
Impossible.

161
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,347
She's of high value to me.
A trading asset.

162
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,375
To sell to her enemies?

163
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:10,783
Politics.

164
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,301
You're not
the whole picture here.

165
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,900
Then no deal.

166
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:22,577
You trust her?

167
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:30,293
I said I need her.

168
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,450
Her military training.

169
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:38,648
Her people.

170
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Come.

171
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,125
Follow me.

172
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,692
Go with Naza. Naza...

173
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:29,438
I don't have clear memories.

174
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:33,577
I remember Lale, her people,

175
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,925
they pulled me
out of that hotel.

176
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,033
Then what?

177
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:42,512
They found someone
to put me back together.

178
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,690
Lale's people did all that?

179
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,688
Yeah.

180
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,367
Why?

181
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,806
I helped them, didn't I?

182
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,635
They repay their debts.

183
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:59,743
Listen to me.
Koba's got them by the neck now.

184
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,801
He takes a hefty cut
of their profits,

185
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,239
and whilst they package his product,
he watches like a hawk.

186
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:11,597
I need to get you
somewhere safer soon, Mum.

187
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:14,165
How long have you been here?

188
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,293
3 months.

189
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:20,111
It had to be this way.

190
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,991
All you had to do
was pick up the phone

191
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,670
and tell us
you were still breathing.

192
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,183
- It would have been a risk.
- I didn't even know you were alive.

193
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:29,967
It was easier without
his fuck-up family. He's got a point.

194
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,364
What have you
been doing exactly?

195
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,700
The towers.
The money. The gangs.

196
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:49,417
- I'm taking it all back.
- Did they fix your head right?

197
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,525
- I mean it.
- With a bunch of terrorists?

198
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,294
- Seriously?
- Others will join.

199
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:58,193
Once they realise
Koba's not the future, I am.

200
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,450
But you need to step back.
Koba's got inside your networks.

201
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:05,548
You don't know who to trust.

202
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:11,956
And if I'm to give shelter
to my father's girlfriend,

203
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:14,143
I need to know what you owe her.

204
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,860
She saved my life.

205
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:24,658
Then she's family.

206
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:31,934
Here. Use this instead.

207
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:35,732
Shh, shh.

208
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,770
He wants to be king, doesn't he?

209
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,768
He's got
his little rebel army here.

210
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:51,304
Where does that leave you?

211
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:57,061
Try and get some sleep.

212
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,900
Don't pretend
this isn't happening.

213
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,498
He'll come to you,
ask for all the money,

214
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:05,256
and that's when it's over.

215
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:10,885
- That's not gonna happen.
- No. Because I won't say yes.

216
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:12,992
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

217
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:20,908
I'm Sean.

218
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:26,017
- Is everything all right here?
- I've known worse.

219
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,064
I bet.

220
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:33,422
May I?

221
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:40,938
Hello.

222
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:46,285
I was expecting to see Dad
looking back at me.

223
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:52,093
But no. Not the Wallace eyes.

224
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,549
Lucky break.

225
00:27:57,648 --> 00:28:02,368
Roze. Shh, shh, shh.

226
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,577
What's going on?

227
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,496
Koba's men took Rojan.

228
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:24,585
What do they want?

229
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:33,311
Rojan was selling on the side.
Koba must have found out.

230
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:41,287
What choice do we have?
Koba takes most of our profits.

231
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:43,035
There's not enough to send home.

232
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,964
We agreed to be careful.

233
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:46,923
Careful?

234
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:50,102
What if Koba found
Marian Wallace here?

235
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
Our deal was with Sean Wallace.

236
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:56,378
- Not his family.
- I'll handle it.

237
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:04,045
People have been talking
since you came back.

238
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:09,132
Does she still know who she is?

239
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:33,599
This is a problem for us,
your mother being here.

240
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,156
We'll find somewhere
for my family.

241
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:42,694
My people can't continue
like this.

242
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:44,993
We'll hit Koba
when the time's right.

243
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,770
Patience is not the problem.

244
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:53,129
They need faith that you can
deliver what you promised.

245
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,847
You're under pressure.
I understand.

246
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:58,146
They need faith in you.

247
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
Why did you come back for me?

248
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:18,905
You know too much.
I was protecting myself.

249
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:21,414
That's good to know.

250
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,671
If you want what you claim,
you must be prepared

251
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,130
to do everything
without fear, without care.

252
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,327
This is what it asks of you.

253
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,750
The Georgians are coming.

254
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:08,968
They've got Rojan.

255
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,067
Oh, shit.

256
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:14,995
You need to hide. Come on.
Koba's men are here.

257
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:16,764
- Quick.
- What's going on?

258
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:18,843
- Quick. Come on, come on.
- Mum, go.

259
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:20,942
Go, go, go, go, go.

260
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Quick.

261
00:31:34,254 --> 00:31:36,454
Merwan...

262
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:39,752
- How's life?
- Good.

263
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:41,671
Happy wife, happy life, eh?

264
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:46,709
- I have a question.
- Mm.

265
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:49,587
Are you happy
with the quality of the product?

266
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:52,416
- Are the customers happy?
- Yes.

267
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:55,304
The hours your employees
are required to work,

268
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,263
we negotiated that, yes?

269
00:31:57,362 --> 00:32:01,102
We asked for 10 hours a day.
That is acceptable?

270
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,660
Stay here.

271
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:07,298
The hourly rate,
is that a problem? No?

272
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:09,377
No.

273
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:12,465
So there's no general big problem
between us, correct?

274
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:18,452
- No.
- No.

275
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,047
Oh, my love. No, no!

276
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,936
So... this thief...

277
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:35,603
he's a small problem,
nothing more.

278
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:36,702
Why?

279
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:42,301
You never asked him to steal
because you are not unhappy, huh?

280
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:49,447
He's your brother, yes?
I mean, real brother?

281
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:52,994
The same mother?

282
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:55,233
You all call each other
brother, sister.

283
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:57,331
- I'm just checking.
- He's my brother.

284
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,229
- Hey...
- No.

285
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:04,348
I think your brother
is lying to me.

286
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:05,987
No.

287
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:08,956
Oh! You want to take his place.

288
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:15,322
No. No, no...

289
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Okay!

290
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:21,138
Give your hand.

291
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:23,318
No. No, no.

292
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:27,486
No, Tamaz. No.

293
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:31,034
No!

294
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,070
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

295
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:54,523
Please tell your workers,
the shift is now 12 hours.

296
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,760
Eh.

297
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:59,839
We deliver more,
you package more.

298
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,137
Win, win.

299
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:07,534
Let's go.

300
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,829
How's it progressing
with the Kurds?

301
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:21,828
Koba's becoming
a bigger problem for us.

302
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,106
I've got it under control.

303
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:27,015
And your father's girlfriend
working with your mother?

304
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:30,063
I said I'm handling it.

305
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:33,122
The window to retaliate
is closing, Sean.

306
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:09,582
Sorry.

307
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:15,019
Do you want me to...?

308
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:26,134
Shh.

309
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,306
Do you want her to be like us?

310
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,515
You think I shouldn't be here?

311
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:44,903
You can do what you like.

312
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:49,422
My father was a gambler.
He ran bets for the mafia.

313
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,720
He didn't want to,
but you don't say no.

314
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,717
Then he said no.

315
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:01,145
They shot him in the head
in our kitchen.

316
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,492
My little brother too.

317
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:07,831
So he wouldn't grow up
and take vengeance.

318
00:36:09,629 --> 00:36:12,249
I know what this world is.

319
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:14,388
Roze.

320
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:19,975
How well do you know my mother?

321
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:23,823
Maybe I know
some things you don't.

322
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:29,381
Then you'll know that
she'll screw you over in the end.

323
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,610
Lale, the elders have called a meeting.

324
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:53,268
We need to discuss the Wallaces.

325
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:04,322
Sean.

326
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
After you.

327
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,830
I'm told you're unhappy.
How can I make you happy?

328
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:37,735
The actions of your mother,
Luan, this does not help us.

329
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:43,202
Koba smells rebellion,
so he pushes us.

330
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,360
There is too little profit
to send home.

331
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:48,279
We're not the same
as others in this city, yeah?

332
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:51,437
Those who want power
for its own sake.

333
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:54,466
My people want freedom
in our homelands.

334
00:37:54,574 --> 00:37:58,794
If our business here fails,
as it fails now,

335
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:00,472
for us there are other cities,

336
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,511
other ways
to continue the struggle.

337
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,470
Your business won't fail.

338
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:07,189
When Koba's gone,
you'll have a place in this city.

339
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,147
I promised you that.

340
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,246
Too slow.

341
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,821
I said I'd hit anyone
who sides with Koba.

342
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,060
That's not enough now.
It's time to escalate.

343
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:27,358
We'd like
to share your confidence.

344
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:30,996
Yeah, we need each other.

345
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:37,093
But you need us more.
Without us, you're alone.

346
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,892
I'll give you money
to send home.

347
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,090
I'll give you weapons
for the fight ahead.

348
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,629
These things are yours to give?

349
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,787
Your mother
has her own ambitions, no?

350
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:54,824
Like I said, you have my word.

351
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:58,222
Then let us see.

352
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:20,558
I remember this.

353
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:24,457
Street grunt, isn't it?

354
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,805
Hands up.

355
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:32,692
Front seat. Come on.

356
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:46,015
Thought I'd be
higher up your kill list.

357
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:50,563
Funny. I was told
you were off limits.

358
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,680
Joseph Singer.
He was very insistent.

359
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:04,267
Turns out you and I
are on the same side. For now.

360
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:12,313
I do not give a fuck
about you or Singer.

361
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:17,829
But Koba would. Especially
as you've been killing his new friends.

362
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,915
See this here?

363
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:28,384
The surgeon said
a hair either way and, pff...

364
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,820
Miracle, really.

365
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,938
Then I thought,
did he mean to do it?

366
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:43,506
That's very Elliot.
Anything for a clean conscience.

367
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:45,394
Say thank you.

368
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:46,993
You're such a good liar.

369
00:41:47,092 --> 00:41:49,712
You even fall
for your own bullshit.

370
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:55,170
I asked for the worst case,
you know. Finn's file was huge.

371
00:41:57,287 --> 00:42:00,467
Money laundering,
extortion, conspiracy,

372
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:03,915
ABH, GBH, murder,
kidnap, trafficking.

373
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:10,082
Yours... was empty.

374
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:14,819
Nothing. No one cares.

375
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:17,457
You're an irrelevance.

376
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:19,376
You're not your dad

377
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:21,725
and you don't know
how to do any of this.

378
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,834
You finished?

379
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:29,732
Singer said you're back in,
but you want out.

380
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:33,189
Make your mind up.
We both know why you're really here.

381
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:36,287
You and I want the same thing.

382
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:38,886
To rid this city
of the Investors.

383
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:43,455
So either help me or fuck off.

384
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:52,578
Go on, then.

385
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:57,036
You're right.

386
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,825
Don't have to.
You're all hiding under one roof.

387
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:01,934
Could just give Koba
Lale's address,

388
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:06,252
and that's all the Wallaces
in one, right?

389
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:15,666
We're not on the same side.

390
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:40,114
Where's Sean?

391
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:46,591
He says you and your people
saved his life.

392
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:49,609
What's in this for you,
Lale, hm?

393
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:53,047
Must have killed you
to see me walking back in here.

394
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:56,096
Thought you had him wrapped
around your little finger, didn't you?

395
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:04,621
This is hard for you, isn't it?

396
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:08,139
What is?

397
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:11,997
He's not scared of you anymore.

398
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,806
He's waiting for you on the roof.

399
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:32,007
Sean, what's going on?

400
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:35,524
Where the fuck have you been?

401
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:40,222
I lied about
what happened to me.

402
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:43,581
- I want you to listen closely.
- No.

403
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,159
You listen to me.
I've had enough.

404
00:44:49,196 --> 00:44:51,676
One more lie out of your mouth
and we're done.

405
00:44:57,872 --> 00:45:03,132
After I was shot,
I wasn't with Lale's people.

406
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:05,489
I was taken by someone else.

407
00:45:05,588 --> 00:45:08,308
I was a captive. Lale too.

408
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:12,955
The Investors
have other enemies.

409
00:45:13,064 --> 00:45:15,324
Some of them
inside our government.

410
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:17,562
They're secretive
and they're few,

411
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:19,881
and they want the Investors out.

412
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,980
They and I want the same thing.

413
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:25,778
What are you after?

414
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:30,036
I want you to know everything.
I want a clean slate between us.

415
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:32,125
No.

416
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:35,813
What do you want?

417
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:42,809
I want you to give me
Dad's money.

418
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:46,567
And I want your arms contacts.

419
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:50,855
Can you do that?

420
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:54,304
You and Floriana,
how does it work?

421
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:56,402
Forget it.

422
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,340
She controls the accounts.
Your father saw to that.

423
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:03,139
So how does it work, then?
Do you beg?

424
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:06,177
She helped me when there was
nobody else around for me.

425
00:46:06,276 --> 00:46:09,806
- I can't just take everything from her.
- Grown sentimental in your old age.

426
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,934
- Fuck off.
- I'm the one you don't trust!

427
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:15,773
- Bloody right I don't trust you, Sean.
- I'm sorry.

428
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:19,171
No, you're not. You're only sorry
you're having to beg for what's mine.

429
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:23,489
- I should have told you I was alive.
- Yes, you should have!

430
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:25,667
- I thought you were dead.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:30,324
- I'm sorry.
- You crucified me!

432
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:33,923
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:46:39,738 --> 00:46:41,738
Sorry.

434
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:47,946
There were days
and weeks and months,

435
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:52,414
inside what was left of my head,
when I forgot who I was.

436
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:59,369
But I know now.

437
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:02,247
I'm a Wallace.

438
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,796
I'm a fucking Wallace,
all or nothing.

439
00:47:08,123 --> 00:47:12,243
And I'm gonna protect us
and get what we deserve.

440
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,490
Be patient. You'll receive
the money soon, okay?

441
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,588
When? When? I don't know when.

442
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:06,474
Your people need help.

443
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:10,852
If you're looking to Sean Wallace,
it would be a mistake.

444
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:20,766
I can offer you something better.

445
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,484
I have the means.

446
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,362
And the connections.

447
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
Shall I continue?

448
00:48:35,597 --> 00:48:37,597
There would be a condition.

449
00:49:04,902 --> 00:49:06,602
What?

450
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:08,701
Can I tell you a secret?

451
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,298
Dad was scared of you.

452
00:49:14,257 --> 00:49:16,257
He knew
you were smarter than him.

453
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:21,094
You got lost on purpose,
didn't you?

454
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:24,852
So he'd never want you involved.

455
00:49:25,971 --> 00:49:27,971
You see people for what they are.

456
00:49:30,128 --> 00:49:32,128
You don't miss a trick, do you?

457
00:49:38,804 --> 00:49:43,124
I need you here,
watching my back.

458
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,359
Will you do that, Billy?

459
00:49:55,795 --> 00:49:57,785
Yeah, I will.

460
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:09,709
Thank you.

461
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:15,066
Thank you.

462
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:23,382
Come with me.

463
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:04,121
I've spoken
with Lale and Merwan.

464
00:51:05,638 --> 00:51:08,518
From now on,
I will support their business.

465
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:14,385
Is this true?

466
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:21,691
Well, you're a busy devil.

467
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,070
You would have done this to me.

468
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:26,988
So what would you like me
to do now?

469
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,786
Leave.

470
00:51:35,103 --> 00:51:37,843
You could have had
what you wanted.

471
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:39,441
But you're afraid to do it.

472
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:11,195
You'll have what I promised.
