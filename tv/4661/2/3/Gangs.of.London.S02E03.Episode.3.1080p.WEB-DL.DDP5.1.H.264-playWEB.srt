-你能解释一下吗?-我不知道

你让我找到枪手，我找到了。

你就像个秘密特工。

53
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,757
比利。

是的,没有大便。我说谢谢了吗?

59
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,099
我不能失去你们两个，比利。
I'm not losing you both, Billy.

60
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:59,175
-是啊，妈妈告诉我的。-是的…

00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:07,850
不。走别人的路。你只是运气好。

鱼市场的那个人，那个杀手，是你吗?

64
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,705
到底怎么回事，肖恩?

65
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:21,263
在车里，你说和你一起来的一个人失踪了。
In the car, you said one of the men you came with went missing.

66
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,362
妈妈的一个手下。

67
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:29,899
是的。Darragh。
Yeah. Darragh.

00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,257
他去了銮。我不…
He went to Luan. I don't...

69
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,256
我要和妈妈说话。
I need to speak to Mum.

70
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:36,355
她有麻烦?

她会问一些问题。
She'll have some questions.

72

你的衣服在那里。
Your clothes are there.

73

达拉和基利安仍然下落不明。菜肴的沉默。
Darragh and Killian are still missing. Luan's gone silent.

74
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:06,100
-科巴找到人了。——和比利?
- Koba's got to someone.  - And Billy?

75
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,917
-我们说好的，玛丽安。-伦尼在回来的路上了
- We had a deal, Marian. - Lennie's on his way back.

76
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:14,055
-你说过你能保护我们。——我们离开。
- You said you could protect us. - We're leaving.

77
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,113
或者你可以跑回你的游艇去
Or you can just run off to your yacht

78
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:19,952
等着他们找到你。
and wait for them to track you down.

79
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,991
记得留点钱。
Just make sure you leave money.

80
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:25,149
如果我想，我早就这么做了。
If I wanted, I would have done it a long time ago.

81
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:29,767
芬恩的钱总是引人注目。你知道这一点。
Finn's money will always attract attention. You know this.

82
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:33,565
我知道战争是什么，玛丽安。我就经历过一次。
I know what war is, Marian. I lived through one.

83
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:39,262
如果我们现在躲起来，接下来就会狠狠地揍他们。我们不会退缩。
If we hide now, we hit them hard next. We don't back down.

84
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:41,381
你他妈以为你在跟谁说话?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

85
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,739
我救了你的命，作为交换，我们答应了彼此
I saved your life, and in exchange we promised each other

86
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,458
权力和力量。
power and strength.

87
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,896
你记得你同意了吗?
Do you remember agreeing to that?

88
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:52,795
她不会拥有我的生活。
She won't have the life I had.

89
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,933
哦，哦，哦，哦，哦。
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

90
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:59,651
罗兹。罗兹。嘘，嘘，嘘。
Roze. Roze. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

91
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,610
我们都有自己的计划。
We all have plans for them.

92
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,709
然后他们长大了，一拳打在你脸上。
Then they grow up, punch you in the face.

93
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:09,146
伦尼回来了。得到你的东西。
Lennie's back. Get your things.

94
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:17,042
任何东西,从比利?
Anything from Billy?

95
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:19,981
我会追踪他走的每一步。我会找到他的，我发誓。
I'll track every step he took. I'll find him, I swear.

96
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:27,817
比利?
Billy?

97
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,934
不,妈妈。是我。
No, Mum. It's me.

98
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,291
这是谁?
Who is this?

99
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,169
这是肖恩,妈妈。
It's Sean, Mum.

100
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:46,007
这是肖恩。
It's Sean.

101
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,484
我现在无法解释。你得听我说。
I can't explain now. You need to listen to me.

102
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:55,642
比利是安全的。
Billy's safe.

103
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,220
你得赶紧离开那里。
And you need to get out of there.

104
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,319
科巴来找你了。
Koba's coming for you.

105
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:08,355
妈妈?妈妈?
Mum? Mum?

106
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:13,633
妈妈，你在吗?跟我说话，妈妈。
Mum, are you there? Speak to me, Mum.

107
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:17,011
妈妈，你能听到我说话吗?你在危险!
Mum, can you hear me? You're in danger!

108
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:19,110
妈妈，你有危险了!
Mum, you're in danger!

109
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:04,486
我要去找萝丝!
I have to get Roze!

110
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:21,397

111

罗兹在楼上!我一定要抓住她!

00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,373
来吧,快。就是这样。起来，够了!
Come on, quick. That's it. Get up, that's it!

就这样，待在这里。待在这里。呆在那里。保持下来。
That's it, stay here. Stay here. Stay there. Stay down.

114
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,227
——不!——罗兹。
- No!  - Roze.

115
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:48,043
多环芳烃、多环芳烃、多环芳烃。巴，巴，巴，巴，巴。
Pah, pah, pah. Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah.

116
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:51,321

117
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,777
罗兹!

警卫!
Guard!

136
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:35,703
你想让我在英国法庭上作证
You would like me to testify before a British court...

137
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:41,120
关于投资人的一切

你会得到国家的全力保护。

你的证据将是匿名的。

140
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,715

你觉得这会让投资人离开伦敦吗?

144
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:08,306
根据你脑子里的想法

145
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:11,125
我们会给他们前所未有的打击。
we'll hit them harder than they've ever been hit.

146
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:14,843
你真他妈蠢。
Well, you're fucking stupid.

147
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:20,560
如果你想让他们消失，你就得拿走他们控制的东西。
If you want them gone, you have to take what they control.

148
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:27,236
街的街。黑帮团伙。塔塔。
Street by street. Gang by gang. Tower by tower.

149
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,994
你得把他们彻底摧毁。
You'd have to destroy them from the ground up.

150
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:37,431
你需要…一个返回的国王。

151
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,057
你炸毁了你父亲的城市。现在你想成为他。
You blew up your father's city. Now you want to be him.

152
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:07,895
你没有你以为的那么聪明。
You're not as clever as you think you are.

153
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:18,249
那些想要肖恩·华莱士死的人
The people who wanted Sean Wallace dead...

154
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,347
你才刚刚碰到他们。
you've only just brushed up against them.

155
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:27,405
我研究这个已经很多年了。
I've been on this for years.

156
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:34,321
城市的改变。投资方有了新玩家。
The city's changed. The Investors have a new player.

157
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,798
他们不会看到我来的。就像你说的，我是个鬼。
They won't see me coming. Like you said, I'm a ghost.

158
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:48,154
我需要我的世界里的人。一个帮派。
I'll need people from my world. A gang.

159
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:55,270
她在哪里呢?
Where is she?

160
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,388
不可能的。
Impossible.

161
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,345
她对我很有价值。一个交易资产。
She's of high value to me. A trading asset.

162
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,383
卖给她的敌人?
To sell to her enemies?

163
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:10,782
政治。
Politics.

164
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,300
你不是这里的全部。
You're not the whole picture here.

165
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,898
然后没有达成任何协议。
Then no deal.

166
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:22,576
你信任她吗?
You trust her?

167
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:30,291
我说了我需要她。
I said I need her.

168
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,449
她的军事训练。
Her military training.

169
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:38,647
她的人。
Her people.

170
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,419
来了。
Come.

171
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,134
跟我来。
Follow me.

172
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,691
那宅。那宅……
Go with Naza. Naza...

173
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:29,437
我没有清晰的记忆。
I don't have clear memories.

174
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:33,575
我记得拉尔，她的人民，
I remember Lale, her people,

175
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,933
他们把我从酒店里拉了出来。
they pulled me out of that hotel.

176
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,032
然后呢?
Then what?

177
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:42,510
他们找到了能把我复原的人。
They found someone to put me back together.

178
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,688
这些都是拉尔的人干的?
Lale's people did all that?

179
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,687
是的。
Yeah.

180
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,366
为什么?
Why?

181
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,805
我帮助了他们，不是吗?
I helped them, didn't I?

182
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,643
他们偿还债务。
They repay their debts.

183
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:59,741
听我的。科巴已经掐住他们的脖子了。
Listen to me. Koba's got them by the neck now.

184
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,799
他从他们的利润中抽了很大一部分，
He takes a hefty cut of their profits,

185
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,237
当他们包装他的产品时，他像鹰一样盯着。
and whilst they package his product, he watches like a hawk.

186
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:11,595
我得尽快带你去更安全的地方，妈妈。
I need to get you somewhere safer soon, Mum.

187
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:14,174
你在这里多久了?
How long have you been here?

188
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,292
3个月。
3 months.

189
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:20,111
它必须是这样。
It had to be this way.

190
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,990
你只要拿起电话就行了
All you had to do was pick up the phone

191
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,669
告诉我们你还活着。
and tell us you were still breathing.

192
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,107
-那是有风险的-我都不知道你还活着。
- It would have been a risk. - I didn't even know you were alive.

193
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:29,965
没有他那操蛋的家人，我过得更轻松。他说得有道理。
It was easier without his fuck-up family. He's got a point.

194
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,363
你到底在做什么?
What have you been doing exactly?

195
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,697
塔。这笔钱。团伙。
The towers. The money. The gangs.

196
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:49,415
-我要收回我说的话-他们把你的头治好了吗?
- I'm taking it all back. - Did they fix your head right?

197
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,534
-我是说真的。-和一群恐怖分子?
- I mean it.  - With a bunch of terrorists?

198
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,293
——认真?-其他人也会加入。
- Seriously?  - Others will join.

199
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:58,191
一旦他们意识到科巴不是未来，我就是。
Once they realise Koba's not the future, I am.

200
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,448
但你得退一步。科巴侵入了你们的网络。
But you need to step back. Koba's got inside your networks.

201
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:05,547
你不知道该相信谁。
You don't know who to trust.

202
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:11,963
如果我要收留我父亲的女朋友，
And if I'm to give shelter to my father's girlfriend,

203
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:14,142
我要知道你欠她什么。
I need to know what you owe her.

204
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,859
她救了我的命。
She saved my life.

205
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:24,657
然后她的家人。
Then she's family.

206
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:31,933
在这里。用这个代替。
Here. Use this instead.

207
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:35,731
嘘,嘘。
Shh, shh.

208
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,769
他想当国王，不是吗?
He wants to be king, doesn't he?

209
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,767
他的叛军在这里。
He's got his little rebel army here.

210
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:51,303
那你该怎么办?
Where does that leave you?

211
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:57,060
试着睡一会儿吧。
Try and get some sleep.

212
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,898
别假装什么都没发生。
Don't pretend this isn't happening.

213
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,496
他会来找你要所有的钱
He'll come to you, ask for all the money,

214
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:05,255
这就是结束的时候。
and that's when it's over.

215
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:10,892
-不可能的——没有。因为我不会答应的。
- That's not gonna happen. - No. Because I won't say yes.

216
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:12,991
嘘，嘘，嘘。
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

217
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:20,907
我是肖恩。
I'm Sean.

218
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:26,024
-这里一切都好吗?-我知道更糟的。
- Is everything all right here? - I've known worse.

219
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,063
我敢打赌。
I bet.

220
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:33,421
我可以吗?
May I?

221
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:40,937
你好。
Hello.

222
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:46,294
我还以为爸爸会回头看我呢。
I was expecting to see Dad looking back at me.

223
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:52,091
但是没有。不是华莱士的眼睛。
But no. Not the Wallace eyes.

224
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,548
幸运的突破。
Lucky break.

225
00:27:57,648 --> 00:28:02,365
罗兹。嘘,嘘,嘘。
Roze. Shh, shh, shh.

226
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,576
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

227
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,495
科巴的人带走了罗詹。
Koba's men took Rojan.

228
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:24,594
他们想要什么?
What do they want?

229
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:33,309
罗扬在做副业。科巴一定发现了。
Rojan was selling on the side. Koba must have found out.

230
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:41,285
我们还有什么选择?科巴拿走了我们大部分的利润。
What choice do we have? Koba takes most of our profits.

231
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:43,044
这些钱不够寄回家。
There's not enough to send home.

232
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,963
我们说好要小心的。
We agreed to be careful.

233
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:46,922
谨慎?
Careful?

234
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:50,100
如果科巴在这里找到了玛丽安·华莱士呢?
What if Koba found Marian Wallace here?

235
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,099
我们和肖恩·华莱士有协议
Our deal was with Sean Wallace.

236
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:56,377
-不是他的家人。-我来处理。
- Not his family.  - I'll handle it.

237
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:04,053
自从你回来人们就一直在议论。
People have been talking since you came back.

238
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:09,130
她还知道自己是谁吗?
Does she still know who she is?

239
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:33,597
你妈妈在这里，这对我们来说是个问题。
This is a problem for us, your mother being here.

240
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,155
我们会为我的家人找个地方。
We'll find somewhere for my family.

241
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:42,693
我的人不能再这样下去了。
My people can't continue like this.

242
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:44,991
时机成熟时我们就去袭击科巴。
We'll hit Koba when the time's right.

243
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,769
耐心不是问题所在。
Patience is not the problem.

244
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:53,127
他们需要相信你能兑现你的承诺。
They need faith that you can deliver what you promised.

245
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,846
你在压力下。我明白了。
You're under pressure. I understand.

246
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:58,145
他们需要对你有信心。
They need faith in you.

247
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,419
你为什么回来找我?
Why did you come back for me?

248
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:18,914
你知道的太多了。我是在保护自己。
You know too much. I was protecting myself.

249
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:21,412
很高兴知道这一点。
That's good to know.

250
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,670
如果你想要你声称的，你必须做好准备
If you want what you claim, you must be prepared

251
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,128
做任何事都无所畏惧，无所顾虑。
to do everything without fear, without care.

252
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,326
这是它对你的要求。
This is what it asks of you.

253
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,748
格鲁吉亚人来了。
The Georgians are coming.

254
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:08,967
他们有Rojan。
They've got Rojan.

255
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,066
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

256
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,004
你得躲起来。来吧。科巴的人来了。
You need to hide. Come on. Koba's men are here.

257
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:16,763
- - - - - -快。-发生什么事了?
- Quick.   - What's going on?

258
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:18,842
- - - - - -快。加油！加油——妈妈,走了。
- Quick. Come on, come on. - Mum, go.

259
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:20,941
走，走，走，走，走。
Go, go, go, go, go.

260
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,499
快。
Quick.

261
00:31:34,254 --> 00:31:36,453
Merwan……
Merwan...

262
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:39,751
——生活怎么样?——好。
- How's life?   - Good.

263
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:41,670
幸福的妻子，幸福的生活，是吗?
Happy wife, happy life, eh?

264
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:46,707
-我有个问题。毫米。
- I have a question.   - Mm.

265
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:49,586
您对产品的质量满意吗?
Are you happy with the quality of the product?

266
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:52,424
顾客满意吗?——是的。
- Are the customers happy?   - Yes.

267
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:55,303
你的员工需要工作的时间，
The hours your employees are required to work,

268
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,262
我们谈过了，对吧?
we negotiated that, yes?

269
00:31:57,362 --> 00:32:01,100
我们要求每天工作10小时。这是可以接受的吗?
We asked for 10 hours a day. That is acceptable?

270
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,658
待在这里。
Stay here.

271
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:07,297
每小时的工资，有问题吗?没有?
The hourly rate, is that a problem? No?

272
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:09,375
不。
No.

273
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:12,474
所以我们之间没有什么大问题，对吧?
So there's no general big problem between us, correct?

274
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:18,451
——没有。——没有。
- No.   - No.

275
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,046
哦,我的爱。不,不!
Oh, my love. No, no!

276
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,944
所以…这个小偷……
So... this thief...

277
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:35,602
他只是个小问题，仅此而已。
he's a small problem, nothing more.

278
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:36,681
为什么?
Why?

279
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:42,298
你从来没有让他去偷东西因为你并不不快乐，对吧?
You never asked him to steal because you are not unhappy, huh?

280
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:49,454
他是你哥哥，对吗?我是说，亲兄弟?
He's your brother, yes? I mean, real brother?

281
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:52,993
同样的母亲吗?
The same mother?

282
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:55,231
你们都称呼对方为兄弟姐妹。
You all call each other brother, sister.

283
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:57,330
-我只是看看。-他是我哥哥。
- I'm just checking.   - He's my brother.

284
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,228
-嘿…——没有。
- Hey...   - No.

285
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:04,347
我觉得你哥哥在骗我。
I think your brother is lying to me.

286
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:05,986
不。
No.

287
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:08,964
哦!你想取代他的位置。
Oh! You want to take his place.

288
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:15,321
不。不,不……
No. No, no...

289
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,079
好吧!
Okay!

290
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:21,138
给你的手。
Give your hand.

291
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:23,317
不。不,不。
No. No, no.

292
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:27,494
不,一。不。
No, Tamaz. No.

293
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:31,033
不!
No!

294
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,069
嘘，嘘，嘘。
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

295
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:54,520
请告诉你的工人，现在轮班12小时。
Please tell your workers, the shift is now 12 hours.

296
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,759
嗯。
Eh.

297
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:59,837
我们递送的更多，你们包装的更多。
We deliver more, you package more.

298
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,136
赢了,赢了。
Win, win.

299
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:07,533
我们走吧。
Let's go.

300
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,828
库尔德人那边进展如何?
How's it progressing with the Kurds?

301
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:21,826
科巴对我们来说是个更大的问题。
Koba's becoming a bigger problem for us.

302
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,105
我已经控制住了。
I've got it under control.

303
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:27,023
你父亲的女朋友和你母亲一起工作?
And your father's girlfriend working with your mother?

304
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:30,062
我说了我在处理。
I said I'm handling it.

305
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:33,120
报复的机会已经不多了，肖恩。
The window to retaliate is closing, Sean.

306
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:09,581
对不起。
Sorry.

307
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:15,018
你想让我……吗?
Do you want me to...?

308
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:26,132
嘘。
Shh.

309
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,305
你想让她和我们一样吗?
Do you want her to be like us?

310
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,523
你觉得我不该来这里吗?
You think I shouldn't be here?

311
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:44,902
你可以做你喜欢做的事。
You can do what you like.

312
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:49,420
我父亲是个赌徒。他为黑手党做赌注。
My father was a gambler. He ran bets for the mafia.

313
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,719
他不想，但你不能拒绝。
He didn't want to, but you don't say no.

314
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,716
然后他拒绝了。
Then he said no.

315
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:01,154
他们在我们厨房朝他脑袋开了一枪。
They shot him in the head in our kitchen.

316
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,491
我弟弟也是。
My little brother too.

317
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:07,830
这样他就不会长大后去复仇了。
So he wouldn't grow up and take vengeance.

318
00:36:09,629 --> 00:36:12,248
我知道这是什么世界。
I know what this world is.

319
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:14,387
罗兹。
Roze.

320
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:19,984
你有多了解我母亲?
How well do you know my mother?

321
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:23,822
也许我知道一些你不知道的事。
Maybe I know some things you don't.

322
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:29,379
那你就知道她最后会毁了你。
Then you'll know that she'll screw you over in the end.

323
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,609
拉尔，长老们开会了。
Lale, the elders have called a meeting.

324
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:53,266
我们得谈谈华莱士一家。
We need to discuss the Wallaces.

325
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:04,320
肖恩。
Sean.

326
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,559
在你之后。
After you.

327
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,828
我听说你不开心。我怎样才能让你快乐?
I'm told you're unhappy. How can I make you happy?

328
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:37,743
你母亲的行为，栾安，对我们没有帮助。
The actions of your mother, Luan, this does not help us.

329
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:43,200
科巴闻到了叛乱的味道，所以他逼我们。
Koba smells rebellion, so he pushes us.

330
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,359
利润太少，不能寄回家。
There is too little profit to send home.

331
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:48,277
我们和这个城市的其他人不一样，对吧?
We're not the same as others in this city, yeah?

332
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:51,436
那些为了权力而追求权力的人。
Those who want power for its own sake.

333
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:54,474
我的人民希望在我们的家园获得自由。
My people want freedom in our homelands.

334
00:37:54,574 --> 00:37:58,792
如果我们的生意像现在这样失败了，
If our business here fails, as it fails now,

335
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:00,471
对我们来说，还有其他城市，
for us there are other cities,

336
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,510
其他继续斗争的方式。
other ways to continue the struggle.

337
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,469
你的生意不会失败。
Your business won't fail.

338
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:07,187
等科巴走了，你就能在这城市有立足之地了。
When Koba's gone, you'll have a place in this city.

339
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,146
我答应过你的。
I promised you that.

340
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,245
太慢了。
Too slow.

341
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,820
我说过谁支持科巴，我就打谁。
I said I'd hit anyone who sides with Koba.

342
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,058
现在这还不够。是时候升级了。
That's not enough now. It's time to escalate.

343
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:27,357
我们愿意分享你的信心。
We'd like to share your confidence.

344
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:30,995
是的，我们需要彼此。
Yeah, we need each other.

345
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:37,092
但你更需要我们。没有我们，你是孤独的。
But you need us more. Without us, you're alone.

346
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,890
我会给你钱寄回家。
I'll give you money to send home.

347
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,089
我会给你未来战斗的武器。
I'll give you weapons for the fight ahead.

348
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,628
这些东西是你给的吗?
These things are yours to give?

349
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,786
你妈妈有她自己的野心，不是吗?
Your mother has her own ambitions, no?

350
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:54,822
我说过了，我向你保证。
Like I said, you have my word.

351
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:58,221
让我们看看。
Then let us see.

352
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:20,557
我记得这个。
I remember this.

353
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:24,455
街头杂音，不是吗?
Street grunt, isn't it?

354
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,814
举起手来。
Hands up.

355
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:32,691
前面的座位。来吧。
Front seat. Come on.

356
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:46,024
我以为我在你的追杀名单上会更靠前。
Thought I'd be higher up your kill list.

357
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:50,562
有趣。有人告诉我你是禁区。
Funny. I was told you were off limits.

358
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,678
约瑟夫的歌手。他非常坚持。
Joseph Singer. He was very insistent.

359
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:04,274
原来你和我是一伙的。现在。
Turns out you and I are on the same side. For now.

360
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:12,310
我才不在乎你和辛格。
I do not give a fuck about you or Singer.

361
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:17,827
但Koba。尤其是你一直在杀他的新朋友。
But Koba would. Especially as you've been killing his new friends.

362
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,924
看到这个吗?
See this here?

363
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:28,382
外科医生说不管怎样一根头发，噗……
The surgeon said a hair either way and, pff...

364
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,819
奇迹,真的。
Miracle, really.

365
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,937
然后我想，他是故意的吗?
Then I thought, did he mean to do it?

366
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:43,514
这是艾略特。只要问心无愧，什么都可以。
That's very Elliot. Anything for a clean conscience.

367
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:45,393
说声谢谢。
Say thank you.

368
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:46,992
你真会撒谎。
You're such a good liar.

369
00:41:47,092 --> 00:41:49,710
你连自己的屁话都信了。
You even fall for your own bullshit.

370
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:55,168
我说的是最坏的情况。芬恩的文件很大。
I asked for the worst case, you know. Finn's file was huge.

371
00:41:57,287 --> 00:42:00,465
洗钱，勒索，阴谋
Money laundering, extortion, conspiracy,

372
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:03,923
暴杀，暴杀，谋杀，绑架，贩卖。
ABH, GBH, murder, kidnap, trafficking.

373
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:10,080
你的……是空的。
Yours... was empty.

374
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:14,817
没什么。没有人在乎。
Nothing. No one cares.

375
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:17,456
你是一个无关紧要的。
You're an irrelevance.

376
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:19,375
你不是你爸爸
You're not your dad

377
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:21,734
这些你都不知道该怎么做。
and you don't know how to do any of this.

378
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,833
你做完了吗?
You finished?

379
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:29,729
辛格说你回来了，但你想退出。
Singer said you're back in, but you want out.

380
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:33,188
下定决心吧。我们都知道你来这里的真正目的。
Make your mind up. We both know why you're really here.

381
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:36,286
你和我的目标一致。
You and I want the same thing.

382
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:38,885
把投资人赶出这座城市。
To rid this city of the Investors.

383
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:43,462
所以要么帮我，要么滚蛋。
So either help me or fuck off.

384
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:52,577
那么,继续。
Go on, then.

385
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:57,035
你是对的。
You're right.

386
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,834
不需要。你们都躲在一个屋檐下。
Don't have to. You're all hiding under one roof.

387
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:01,933
只要把科巴·拉尔的地址给我，
Could just give Koba Lale's address,

388
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:06,250
这是所有华莱士的集合，对吧?
and that's all the Wallaces in one, right?

389
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:15,665
我们不是一条船上的。
We're not on the same side.

390
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:40,112
肖恩在哪儿?
Where's Sean?

391
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:46,589
他说你和你的人救了他的命。
He says you and your people saved his life.

392
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:49,607
这对你有什么好处，拉尔?
What's in this for you, Lale, hm?

393
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:53,046
看到我回来，你一定很伤心。
Must have killed you to see me walking back in here.

394
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:56,104
你以为你把他玩弄于股掌之间了，是吗?
Thought you had him wrapped around your little finger, didn't you?

395
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:04,620
这对你来说很难，是吧?
This is hard for you, isn't it?

396
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:08,138
是什么?
What is?

397
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:11,996
他不再害怕你了。
He's not scared of you anymore.

398
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,814
他在屋顶等你。
He's waiting for you on the roof.

399
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:32,005
肖恩，怎么了?
Sean, what's going on?

400
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:35,523
你他妈去哪了?
Where the fuck have you been?

401
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:40,221
关于发生在我身上的事我撒了谎。
I lied about what happened to me.

402
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:43,579
-我要你听仔细了。——没有。
- I want you to listen closely.  - No.

403
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,157
你听我说。我受够了。
You listen to me. I've had enough.

404
00:44:49,196 --> 00:44:51,675
你再撒一个谎，我们就结束了。
One more lie out of your mouth and we're done.

405
00:44:57,872 --> 00:45:03,129
我中枪后，没和拉尔的人在一起。
After I was shot, I wasn't with Lale's people.

406
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:05,488
我被别人带走了。
I was taken by someone else.

407
00:45:05,588 --> 00:45:08,306
我是一个俘虏。拉尔。
I was a captive. Lale too.

408
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:12,964
投资人还有其他敌人。
The Investors have other enemies.

409
00:45:13,064 --> 00:45:15,322
他们中的一些人在我们的政府内部。
Some of them inside our government.

410
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:17,561
它们行踪诡秘，数量稀少
They're secretive and they're few,

411
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:19,880
他们想让投资人离开
and they want the Investors out.

412
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,979
他们和我想要的是一样的。
They and I want the same thing.

413
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:25,777
你想要什么?
What are you after?

414
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:30,035
我想让你知道一切。我希望我们之间能重新开始。
I want you to know everything. I want a clean slate between us.

415
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:32,134
不。
No.

416
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:35,812
你想要什么?
What do you want?

417
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:42,808
我要你把爸爸的钱给我。
I want you to give me Dad's money.

418
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:46,566
我要你的手臂接触器。
And I want your arms contacts.

419
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:50,864
你能做到吗?
Can you do that?

420
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:54,302
你和弗罗里安娜是怎么相处的?
You and Floriana, how does it work?

421
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:56,401
算了吧。
Forget it.

422
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,339
她控制着账户。这是你父亲安排的。
She controls the accounts. Your father saw to that.

423
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:03,137
那么它是如何工作的呢?你请吗?
So how does it work, then? Do you beg?

424
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:06,176
当我身边没有别人的时候，她帮助了我。
She helped me when there was nobody else around for me.

425
00:46:06,276 --> 00:46:09,814
-我不能夺走她的一切-你老了变得多愁善感。
- I can't just take everything from her. - Grown sentimental in your old age.

426
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,933
——滚蛋。-我才是你不信任的人!
- Fuck off.  - I'm the one you don't trust!

427
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:15,771
-没错，我不相信你，肖恩——我很抱歉。
- Bloody right I don't trust you, Sean. - I'm sorry.

428
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:19,169
不,你不是。你只会后悔你要乞求我的东西。
No, you're not. You're only sorry you're having to beg for what's mine.

429
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:23,487
-我应该告诉你我还活着。-是的，你应该这么做!
- I should have told you I was alive. - Yes, you should have!

430
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:25,665
-我以为你死了。——我很抱歉。
- I thought you were dead.  - I'm sorry.

431
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:30,323
——我很抱歉。-你把我钉死在十字架上!
- I'm sorry.  - You crucified me!

432
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:33,921
我很抱歉。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:46:39,738 --> 00:46:41,737
对不起。
Sorry.

434
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:47,954
日复一日，周复一周，月复一月，
There were days and weeks and months,

435
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:52,411
当我忘记我是谁的时候，我的脑子里剩下的部分。
inside what was left of my head, when I forgot who I was.

436
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:59,368
但我现在知道了。
But I know now.

437
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:02,246
我是华莱士。
I'm a Wallace.

438
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,804
我他妈是华莱士家的人，要么全有，要么全无。
I'm a fucking Wallace, all or nothing.

439
00:47:08,123 --> 00:47:12,241
我会保护我们，得到我们应得的。
And I'm gonna protect us and get what we deserve.

440
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,488
要有耐心。你很快就会收到钱的，好吗?
Be patient. You'll receive the money soon, okay?

441
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,587
什么时候?什么时候?我不知道是什么时候。
When? When? I don't know when.

442
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:06,472
你的人民需要帮助。
Your people need help.

443

这是真的吗?

466
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:21,690
你可真是个大忙人。

离开。
Leave.

470

但你却不敢这么做。
But you're afraid to do it.

472
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:11,204
你会得到我答应你的。
