1
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:40,067
Hakim, we'll need
to distribute the guns tomorrow,

2
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,256
and guard them for now.

3
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:50,021
Marco, Medhi, you're staying.

4
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,901
Basem will call you first thing.

5
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,779
I'll stay too. Not a problem.

6
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:03,565
Get the fuck out of here.

7
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,044
Do it like Uncle Basem. Go on.

8
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,683
Let's go.

9
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
Cheers.

10
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,797
Whoa!

11
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,145
The fuck are you doing?

12
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,314
Check this.

13
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:49,672
You putting it back together?

14
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:51,751
No? Don't think so...

15
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:54,469
Wow, wow, wow.

16
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,021
Stay seated.

17
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:27,293
Okay.

18
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:31,572
I see you Algerians are busy
so this will take only a few minutes.

19
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,519
One of you can walk away. Okay?

20
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,556
Off, you can go.

21
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:29,182
Who sold you this?

22
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,780
No? Okay.

23
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,171
Swallow, please.

24
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,129
Ah.

25
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,687
Ah...

26
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,115
Ah.

27
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:08,443
Swallow. Yes?

28
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:21,876
Again, please.

29
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,431
Mm.

30
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:37,428
Just one more.

31
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:44,184
Yes...

32
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,378
It's okay. It's okay.

33
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,686
Ask him if he knows
who sold you the guns.

34
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:07,214
No answer, you shoot.
You go free. I promise.

35
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:16,169
We don't know anything...
I swear we don't!

36
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:19,687
So shoot. Three...

37
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,156
- We don't know anything!
- Two...

38
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:23,244
One...

39
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:43,346
Look, I'm here to make the rules now
and secrets are a bad thing.

40
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:46,754
A really very, very bad thing.

41
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,550
Go tell Uncle Basem.

42
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:59,148
Tell him Koba says so. Mm?

43
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:01,226
Go.

44
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,015
Go...

45
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:05,304
Go!

46
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:59,237
This is my city.

47
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:07,593
This is my city.

48
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,390
This is my city.

49
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:28,224
This is my city. I was born
on these streets. They're inside me.

50
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,661
I've seen them change
from year to year

51
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,500
and I know this city's heartbeat
because it's here.

52
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,658
I feel it.

53
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:40,377
Your startup is looking
for 100 million.

54
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,325
My competitors
will offer you the moon.

55
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:44,214
Some will throw in a few stars

56
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:48,013
but I'm the only one
that can join this... to this.

57
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:53,371
Plus... a buy-in of 200 million.

58
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:57,128
Thank you for your trust.

59
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,007
Thank you.

60
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,921
2 minutes.
Help yourselves to drinks, yeah?

61
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,878
I'm early.

62
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:26,234
Abdullah Shafak, one of my
clients, was killed in Turkey last night.

63
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,832
Were you aware?

64
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:30,911
The 200 million you laundered
for Shafak wasn't his to give,

65
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,270
nor was it yours to invest elsewhere.

66
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:37,509
Our investors would like it back.
Does it give you any trouble?

67
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:42,055
Nothing I can't handle.

68
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:49,543
You're worried your new friends
will see who they're dealing with.

69
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,380
They're dealing with Dumani Finances.
Clean funds all the way.

70
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:59,417
- Ignorance is bliss.
- And I don't like surprises,

71
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:03,646
so next time something like this needs
to happen, how about you tell me?

72
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,853
Reasonable.

73
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,652
Remember, though,
everyone thought

74
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,572
that the Wallaces would
take you down with them.

75
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,010
I never doubted you.

76
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,007
I remember everything.

77
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:30,282
Let me know
when you've transferred the funds.

78
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,269
Alex...

79
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:59,747
Alex... Help me.

80
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,059
Oh, excuse me.

81
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:26,423
Can you fix this, Ed?

82
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:29,942
It's a bit late for that,
don't you think?

83
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,180
Can you fix it?

84
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:50,531
I appreciate your presence here

85
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,330
so that we can sort out
this unnecessary mess.

86
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,408
Who chose this shithole?

87
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,487
I think you all know
his name by now.

88
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:05,804
Koba.

89
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:09,282
Don't forget
why he was invited to London.

90
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,121
If the bodies were not
piling up on the streets,

91
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,278
if you would have listened
to the warnings,

92
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,637
there would be no need for Koba.

93
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:21,785
I've given them my word.

94
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:25,594
The Investors asked for order

95
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:28,752
and order is what I'm giving them.

96
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,710
I expect you all
to fall in line.

97
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,490
Would you mind standing, please?

98
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:23,315
Some of you may know Mr Soudani.

99
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,284
You haven't seen
them round this table

100
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:28,763
but today he's here to help.

101
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,841
Who sold you this?

102
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,398
It was a blind deal.

103
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:39,117
Ooh! Exciting.
Tell me about that.

104
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:45,705
Er... No names, no faces.
And er... payment was off-shore.

105
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,152
Good. Very good.

106
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:52,471
Exactly what I would do,
if I wanted to insult Mr Afridi.

107
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,589
If I wanted to make a fool of me.

108
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,787
That's what I would do.

109
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:02,815
Boss here said this.

110
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,223
Nobody sells guns
in this city except me.

111
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:16,179
Which bit of that was fuzzy?
Which bit didn't add up?

112
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:23,126
You owe a debt to myself,
to Mr Afridi. Yes?

113
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,370
But that's for later.

114
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:41,166
Business has rules.

115
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:44,764
I see they are followed.

116
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:51,722
Our friend here made a mistake.
He knows that.

117
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,799
But whoever sold these guns
doesn't want rules.

118
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:56,878
They think they are special.

119
00:19:57,357 --> 00:20:01,117
Shall I tell you who else
thought they were special?

120
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:03,185
Finn Wallace.

121
00:20:03,713 --> 00:20:05,793
His lunatic son.

122
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:09,352
Do they sit with us now?

123
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:15,269
Ed Dumani knows
what I'm talking about.

124
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,548
Did he make mistakes back then?
Maybe so.

125
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:22,895
But he understands
things had to change.

126
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:27,503
There's a future for you,
right, Edward?

127
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:30,262
And your son, Alex.

128
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:38,178
Somebody here
wants to start a war.

129
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,616
One they cannot win.

130
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,245
I gave Mr Afridi my word.

131
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,733
I will find you.

132
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,250
And you will make amends.

133
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:27,593
He doesn't know
the first thing about this city.

134
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,711
Why do you think I chose him?

135
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,870
No affiliations.

136
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:34,709
- He's a clean skin.
- He's a wind-up.

137
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:38,068
Help me find out
who's behind the guns.

138
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:46,415
These people still listen
to Ed Dumani... don't they?

139
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,370
Such a tragedy.
His family is waiting.

140
00:22:18,806 --> 00:22:22,556
Blessings be upon you.
Marco was a good boy.

141
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:31,481
Faz, help me get this down...
Faz?

142
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:00,266
They're saying it's a car accident?

143
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:05,184
Wasn't that, was it?

144
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,369
Faz.

145
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:41,046
What's going on? Huh? What?

146
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:45,644
- You knew, innit?
- What you talking about?

147
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:49,202
You knew Koba was coming.
That's why you didn't want me there.

148
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:52,401
All right. Let's go and tell
Marco's little daughters what happened.

149
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:56,279
That big man Faz blew Marco's fucking
brains out to save his own skin.

150
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:02,066
Look at me.
Basem doesn't know what day it is.

151
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,914
He's got us
in the wrong fucking sight.

152
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:09,152
Now we got to cover
for that Albanian prick.

153
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,950
We just arrived.

154
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,589
Yeah, the removal guys are here too.

155
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:17,228
Okay, come tonight.
We'd love to see you.

156
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:20,626
No problem, no.

157
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:26,263
No socks on the shiny stairs.

158
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,342
We just arrived.

159
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:36,499
From Saranda.
They're coming over this afternoon.

160
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,257
But we said tomorrow, right?

161
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:42,206
What, so I say don't come?
She's too excited.

162
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:44,294
Zamir's bringing his guitar.

163
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:48,732
My sweetheart.

164
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,185
My sister-in-law made that.

165
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:25,753
Thank you.

166
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,710
Nice place.

167
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,789
Thank you.

168
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:41,026
Basem did a fantastic cover-up job.

169
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,859
What are you talking about?

170
00:25:55,937 --> 00:26:01,527
Luan, I know you sold him those guns.

171
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:05,094
- And who am I talking to?
- I'm here to help you.

172
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:09,892
Help me... or yourself?

173
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,209
You choose sides so fast.

174
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:15,329
That kind of weaponry
is unprecedented.

175
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,408
My partners need
to defend themselves.

176
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:20,926
I need to defend myself.

177
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,755
So you're plotting a war?

178
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:27,684
I know how volatile things are right now
but that's not good for anyone's business.

179
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,040
Heroin is my business now.

180
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:37,558
I've always used my own suppliers.

181
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:41,466
Trusted, productive people
from back home.

182
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:47,834
Now Koba wants me to buy from Asif.

183
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:50,951
Only him.

184
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:55,269
Do you know why?

185
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,508
So he can control me.

186
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:59,586
I won't do it.

187
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:04,304
Because next time
he's gonna come around,

188
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:08,863
it's not my supply he'll want.
It's my profit.

189
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,260
And he already got his boot
on my neck.

190
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:18,777
This is not how we do business

191
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:20,976
in this city.

192
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:25,094
What if I offer you reassurances?

193
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:27,173
From Koba?

194
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,971
- Bullshit.
- From the Investors.

195
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,170
I'm not gonna lay down
and beg like the others.

196
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,649
Then you're going to have
to give something in return, Luan.

197
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:37,368
Who supplied those guns?

198
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,315
First things first.

199
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,763
Talk to the Investors.
I need guarantees.

200
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
I'm glad you're listening.

201
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,958
Thinking about all this.

202
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:01,465
All this is why I fight.

203
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,890
What's going on Elliot?

204
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:57,368
You were told to hit Mr Shafak
on arrival in his car.

205
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:04,515
You were late. You were drunk.
You drew undue attention to us.

206
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:09,882
We plan these things.
You follow the plan.

207
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Or there are consequences.

208
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:19,357
We own you
and your father, Elliot.

209
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:21,545
Do you have a problem with that?

210
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,193
No.

211
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:30,671
Good.

212
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,110
The fee has been released
to the usual accounts.

213
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:36,188
Wait one second...

214
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:43,944
Did you receive the itinerary?

215
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:51,101
Been a while, hasn't it?

216
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,620
I've let our contacts know
you'll be arriving.

217
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:57,978
The order of things has shifted
since you were last there.

218
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:01,325
Elliot...

219
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:05,214
I know when you left it was difficult

220
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:07,333
but don't get distracted by the past.

221
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,319
Signature there.

222
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:41,507
Don't tell my family anything.
Understood?

223
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:50,631
Cop killer!

224
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,460
Espresso, please.

225
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:19,538
So Luan is distributing the guns.
I wish I could say I was surprised.

226
00:31:19,615 --> 00:31:22,765
It's a play for leverage.
He needs peace to run his business.

227
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:26,614
He wants to maintain his own supply.
He doesn't want to buy from you.

228
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:29,212
- It's a good price.
- For now.

229
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,650
But Luan's not stupid.

230
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:33,609
He has a major stake
in this town now.

231
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:36,848
Manpower. Allies.
He's not to be underestimated.

232
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:39,566
What would he settle for?

233
00:31:39,645 --> 00:31:42,195
A guarantee from the Investors.

234
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:47,404
A degree of independence
in return for his loyalty.

235
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:51,641
And all this nonsense
with guns... stops?

236
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,799
And he will tell us
who supplied them.

237
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,718
He will. Trust me.

238
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:01,236
Of course.
I'll instruct Koba to hold off for now.

239
00:32:01,314 --> 00:32:05,314
But until he gives us his supplier,
Luan is on thin ice.

240
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,751
Thank you for looking into this, Ed.

241
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:17,908
You know, Finn Wallace
was an old fool.

242
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:21,576
But he was smart...
when he chose you.

243
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,739
♪ ...no lust, no fear

244

00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:43,005
Oh, fuck.

00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:49,133

248
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,779
- Bye.
- Bye, Danny.

249
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:02,165
Here, I'll carry it.
How was football.?

250
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,208
- Mum?
- Hey. Hi!

251
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,247
Sorry. Excuse me?
Ms Dumani?

252
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:29,121
Yes?

253
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,960
Mr Dumani.
Your daughter, she's taken Danny.

254
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,597
Thank you, Jamya.

255
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,396
What should I do? She just...

256
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:41,505
I'll take it from here.

257
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:54,629
Shannon's out.

258
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,427
I spoke to her lawyer.

259
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:00,786
The police messed up
evidence procedures.

260
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,895
Her case would have
fallen apart at trial.

261
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:04,384
That's the best news.

262
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:06,863
She told her lawyer
not to contact the family.

263
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:11,981
I told her I would get her out
once things had calmed down.

264
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:15,019
She killed a cop, Alex.
I don't have a magic wand.

265
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:17,418
She knew my hands were tied.

266
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:19,976
She told you she understood.
She told me she understood.

267
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:22,205
That's what we wanted to hear.

268
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:23,854
What?

269
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,373
She killed that cop to protect us.

270
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:27,532
Our lives carried on as usual.

271
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:30,051
Look... She'll come home.

272
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,049
We should celebrate.

273
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:37,767
I did everything in my power.

274
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,166
- You did.
- What a day.

275
00:35:42,164 --> 00:35:44,164
She's back.

276
00:35:45,842 --> 00:35:48,522
We got her back.

277
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:50,961
This means we can be a family again.

278
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:11,751
- Uncle Alex.
- How you doing, big man? Hey!

279
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:16,349
Danny, um, I need to speak
to Uncle Alex. Take this for me.

280
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:22,895
Your lawyer told me you were here.

281
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,664
Oh, you paid her? That's nice.

282
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:30,342
I had to see you. I'm sorry.
You can beat me up if you like.

283
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,820
No, don't. Don't.
I'm not doing it like that.

284
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,139
- I'll do it however you like.
- I want to be with Danny.

285
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:41,927
So you can go back to your tower
and do... whatever it is you do.

286
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:43,134
Work.

287
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:46,333
You and Dad decided it's a fuck sight
more important than my life.

288
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:50,731
- Look...
- That was the deal you made.

289
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:58,127
You're right. We gave in.

290
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:01,315
The people I work for,
the Investors,

291
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:04,764
they didn't want a Dumani
walking free on a cop killing.

292
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:06,643
I'm bad for the brand.

293
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:10,442
I'm getting us out.
Out of all of this.

294
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,639
And I'm so close, Shannon.

295
00:37:13,718 --> 00:37:16,878
Soon I'll have us out
of this whole fucking world. I promise.

296
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:19,397
No more laundering.
No more Investors.

297
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:21,145
I'll take care of all of us.

298
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:23,234
Everything I'm doing...

299
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:26,873
I can make this right.

300
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:29,792
Better than right, I swear.

301
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,870
It's on me now.

302
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,987
I'll sort myself out.

303
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:44,455
If you do want to help...
leave us alone.

304
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:03,214
I hear you're meeting
with the Investors tonight

305
00:38:03,293 --> 00:38:05,173
about your start-up
financing scheme.

306
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:07,252
Do you really think that's wise?

307
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,691
Look, like I said before,

308
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:16,010
this model is completely compatible
with what I do for the Investors.

309
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:20,366
The more it thrives, the better partner
I can be for them and their business.

310
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:22,435
For how long?

311
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:25,643
Looking at the direction of your travel,

312
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:28,522
is your plan to escape
from them completely?

313
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:32,481
You need that 200 million
for your new business, don't you?

314
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:37,118
I'm told the Investor concerned
would like it passed over to him.

315
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:38,916
Don't make him wait.

316
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:41,346
I've made more money for them
than anyone in this city.

317
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:46,234
We were attacked today, Alex.
It's not a good time for negotiations.

318
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:48,592
Pretty sure I know how they think.

319
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:51,951
Maybe even better than you.
All due respect.

320
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,746
Forgive me.

321
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:04,144
You think clean money
means a clean soul?

322
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:08,463
What happened to Sean,
to your family... it was just business.

323
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,581
Fuck you.

324
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,900
You've bitten the hand
that feeds you.

325
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:16,099
Don't be surprised
if it bites you back.

326
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:21,605
You should have let me
handle this.

327
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,690
Good luck with your meeting.

328
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:35,859
Hold off on the next delivery.
There is an issue on my end.

329
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:37,937
Everything is okay.

330
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,776
I'll share details later.

331
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:47,134
Please confirm no delivery.
I'll wait for a call.

332
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Honey.

333
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,949
Hey.

334
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,379
Save me a slice, yeah?

335
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:48,913
Uh, I'm expecting guests
so send them up to the terrace.

336
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:34,808
Asif.

337
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:36,888
Ed...

338
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,606
The Investors have made it clear.

339
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:43,155
Anyone who acts out of line
is to be dealt with.

340
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:46,083
Zero tolerance.

341
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:50,681
I'm sorry but my hands are tied,

342
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Luan. What's wrong?

343
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:30,221
Who are we talking about?

344
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,489
Just put it down and we'll talk.

345
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:00,806
Sit.

346
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:34,709
You're working for them?

347
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:39,826
That's almost funny.

348
00:45:40,545 --> 00:45:42,535
Fuck!

349
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:51,661
You killed Sean for them?
You fucking snake.

350
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:53,859
- I didn't have a choice.
- Poor Elliot.

351
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:58,618
You know, you're only here
because they wanted you here.

352
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:03,965
And now they don't.
Too much of a liability.

353
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,970
What the fuck are you waiting for?

354
00:46:33,638 --> 00:46:37,918
Our bosses.
Years of incrimination.

355
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:40,476
Years of wrongdoing.
It's all there.

356
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:48,392
- Sean gave you this?
- Can't go to the police.

357
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:51,191
Courts. Media.
The Investors own it all.

358
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:55,828
But with you, this...

359
00:46:57,786 --> 00:46:59,706
this is how we get out.

360
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:01,535
You want to blackmail the Investors?

361
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:04,024
And you'll know how.
Better than anyone.

362
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:09,902
I can't do this by myself, Alex.
I've tried.

363
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:15,139
But you know who to contact.
Make a deal.

364
00:47:15,217 --> 00:47:17,697
Think about it.

365
00:47:17,776 --> 00:47:21,046
My father. Your family.
Both of us.

366
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:26,014
This will keep us safe,
all right?

367
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:35,529
Was there anything
I could have done...

368
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:37,607
to save Sean?

369
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:40,915
No.

370
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:44,764
No.

371
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:49,841
Open your laptop.
Look at these files.

372
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,836
Please, Alex.

373
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:03,945
They'll find me.
They'll kill my family.

374
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,351
I can't allow that to happen.

375
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:22,775
Go to Shannon. She needs you.

376
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:25,783
What?

377
00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:28,342
Watch over my father.

378
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:35,298
No, Alex! Stop!

379
00:48:36,137 --> 00:48:37,537
You can't beat them.

380
00:48:37,616 --> 00:48:39,616
No! No! No... Alex!

381
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:13,959
You have no new messages.

382
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,799
Zeus. What's up, my boy?

383
00:50:37,116 --> 00:50:38,916
You want some cheese?

384
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:40,985
Come. Come.

385
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:44,594
Come.

386
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:46,673
Wanna pee?

387
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,111
Come. Get out.

388
00:52:00,395 --> 00:52:02,145
Wake up, girls. Quick...

389
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,234
Papa?

390
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:08,831
What's happened?

391
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,310
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

392
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,710
- What's happening?
- Go inside.

393
00:52:12,788 --> 00:52:15,348
- Something's wrong.
- Get the girls in first.

394
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:17,427
Go, babe, go.

395
00:52:17,986 --> 00:52:19,786
Mummy loves you.

396
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,783
Tell me what's going on.

397
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:26,542
Quiet, take your sister.
What's happening?

398
00:52:26,622 --> 00:52:29,262
- Nothing.
- Don't tell me it's nothing...

399
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,580
- Listen to me.
- What's going on?

400
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:34,859
- What's the code to the safe?
- The code?

401
00:52:35,897 --> 00:52:37,937
It's your birthday.
But tell me what's happen...

402
00:52:38,016 --> 00:52:40,456
Everything's okay.
Stay with the girls.

403
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:42,525
Luan...

404
00:52:46,532 --> 00:52:48,532
Luan!

405
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:33,509
Koba!

406
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:54,879
Too... late...

407
01:00:15,347 --> 01:00:18,187
Mirlinda... Mirlinda!

408
01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:34,819
Where's Mum? Where's Mum?

409
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:01,476
This is Luan Dushaj.
I can't get to the phone right now.

410
01:01:01,884 --> 01:01:05,684
Please leave a message
and I'll return your call. Thank you.
