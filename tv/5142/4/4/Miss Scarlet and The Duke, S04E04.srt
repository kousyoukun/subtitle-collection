1
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:04,332
I'm running this London office
now,

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:05,532
and I can assure you
things will pick up.

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:09,699
I happen to know
that Mr. Nash's

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,999
entire staff have deserted you.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,699
Sometimes I do wonder...

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,132
If it's all worth it?

7
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,765
This expansion is crippling us.

8
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,299
Someone is going to get hurt.

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,599
It's Inspector Wellington.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,865
He's been shot.

11
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,032
William!

12
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,999
I need a drink.

13
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:57,965
Are you warm enough?

14
00:00:57,966 --> 00:00:59,565
It can get a bit chilly
in here.

15
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,899
Yes, I'm perfectly comfortable,
thank you.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,232
I'll go set the fire.

17
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,265
Ivy, will you please
stop fussing?

18
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,765
I'm not fussing!

19
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,765
I'll go do you some bacon,
eggs, and fried bread.

20
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,865
How does that sound?

21
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:09,265
Like I'm going to
get extremely fat.

22
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,599
We need to build up
your strength.

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,065
Yes, Ivy,
you have been saying that

24
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,232
every day
for the past two weeks.

25
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,699
I'm quite well now,
thank you.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,899
Well enough to go home.

27
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,165
I can't seem to find my bag,
or my notebook, or my gloves.

28
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,665
Your gloves were
in the dining room,

29
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,532
your notebook
by the kitchen sink,

30
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:25,865
and your bag on the stairs,

31
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,265
which I nearly broke my neck on
this morning.

32
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,865
I've just come downstairs--
I didn't see it.

33
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:31,399
Because I put them on the table
with the rest of your things,

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,999
where you should have
left them last night.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,632
Oh.

36
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:37,200
Well, thank you.

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,299
How is the patient
this morning?

38
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,765
He says he's going home.

39
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,099
Just ignore him, Ivy.

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,365
I find that's the best way
to deal with him.

41
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,765
You were told to rest,
William.

42
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:50,765
And there's no one better
to look after you than Ivy.

43
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:52,365
Yes, well, I can't just
sit here all day.

44
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:53,732
No.

45
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:56,832
You can come to the kitchen
and have breakfast.

46
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,032
Just one rasher, please,
Ivy.

47
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,765
- Ha!

48
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,299
God!

49
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,065
If I'd known what
an appalling nurse you were,

50
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,465
I wouldn't have agreed
to convalesce here.

51
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,299
If I'd known what a
demanding patient you were,

52
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,465
I wouldn't have let you.

53
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,932
Well, unlike you, I can't laze
around like a lord of leisure.

54
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,499
My office won't run itself.

55
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,832
Yes, I can imagine how busy
running a staff of one must be.

56
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,465
I can assure you, William,
that it will not be long

57
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:30,232
before my office is once again
teeming with employees.

58
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,899
Things are looking up
at Nash and Sons.

59
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,399
Not that he has any sons.

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,565
Promise me you'll rest,
and do as Ivy says.

61
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,265
Do I have a choice?

62
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,932
Umm...

63
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:42,999
No.

64
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:48,065
Oh, God, that hurts!

65
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,665
Good morning, Clarence.

66
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,399
And a very good morning to you,
too, Miss Scarlet.

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,765
You're rather chipper.

68
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:02,899
You feeling quite well?

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,065
Oh, never better.

70
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,999
I arrived this morning
to be greeted

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,432
by a most pleasant surprise.

72
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,799
Bonjour, Eliza.

73
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,166
What the hell have you done?!

74
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,765
I leave you a business
that is thriving

75
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,965
and come back to find it
barely surviving!

76
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:31,065
It's not my fault your men
refused to work for a woman!

77
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,699
Well, from what I hear,
your manner towards them

78
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,932
left much to be desired.

79
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,799
I was trying to run
a tight ship.

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,632
Well, congratulations, Eliza,
because you've sunk it.

81
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,199
There were always going to be
some teething problems.

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,199
You have no staff.

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,032
No clients.

84
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:45,632
I would suggest that's a little
more than "teething problems."

85
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,999
Things are starting to move
in the right direction.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,365
I have several
potential clients.

87
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,899
There's really no need
for you to be here.

88
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,065
It is my name
above the door

89
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,999
and my reputation
that is being damaged!

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,732
So I'm staying in London

91
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:59,465
until this ship
is back on course!

92
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,099
I assume this is your doing.

93
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,599
I did not ask
Mr. Nash to return.

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,065
I merely provided him
with progress reports

95
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,432
whenever he requested them.

96
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,965
And you didn't think to
tell me you were doing that.

97
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,499
He is my superior, Miss Scarlet.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,999
And I did tell him
that things were picking up.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,932
Mm, I admire your optimism,
Clarence.

100
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,832
But I fear we have

101
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,265
different definitions of what
constitutes "picking up."

102
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,365
Where are you going?

103
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:12,699
I'm going to the Fat Goose,

104
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,465
patronized by the
Metropolitan Police,

105
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,132
half the journalists
of Fleet Street,

106
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,365
and the lawyers of the
Royal Courts of Justice.

107
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,799
When I've oiled
my fellow punters

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,799
with copious amounts
of whiskey,

109
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,865
I shall, no doubt, be in
possession of some new cases.

110
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,365
If you'd done me the courtesy
of actually listening

111
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:27,899
to what I had to say,

112
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,632
you'd know that I have a meeting
with a client this very hour.

113
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,932
A client with money
and influence.

114
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,865
I'll be the judge of that.

115
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,632
Come along.

116
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,065
You have a beautiful home,
Mr. Carter.

117
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,332
All down to my Maisie.

118
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,199
I'm just the one
who paid for it.

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,432
We moved in
just over a year ago.

120
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,865
It was hard work,

121
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,799
but we've finally got things
how we like them.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,165
And where were you
living before?

123
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,565
Uh, Leeds.

124
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,565
Moved down to London
to set up a new factory.

125
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:12,799
I'm in the textile business.

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,965
It's good, indeed,
to hear such a success story.

127
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,265
Around here,

128
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:19,532
it doesn't seem to matter
what money you've got.

129
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,132
It's all about your breeding.

130
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,165
The aristocracy
do not like new money.

131
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,732
I don't care what the toffs
are like with me,

132
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,899
just as long as their wives
treat my Maisie right.

133
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,365
And they do.

134
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:34,132
They've been very...
accommodating.

135
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,599
Now, that is her way
of saying

136
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,999
they're a bunch of
stuck-up snobs.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,599
Jack!

138
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,465
Will you be wanting tea, sir?

139
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:46,899
Perhaps later.

140
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,799
Thank you, Stafford.

141
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,399
What is it we can help you with,
Mr. Carter?

142
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,465
Tuesday evening,
we hosted a charity fundraiser

143
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,465
for the committee
Maisie belongs to.

144
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:03,299
The ladies of the Mayfair
Benevolent Society.

145
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,699
And it was
a roaring success, too.

146
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,332
Almost 100 souls
turned up.

147
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,933
Two hours in, we were robbed.

148
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,365
What was in it?

149
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:15,832
Nelson's diamond feather,

150
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,599
given to the admiral

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,865
by the sultan of Turkey
after the Battle of the Nile.

152
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,332
How did it come
into your possession?

153
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,099
Bought it at auction.

154
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,799
Spent a fortune, too.

155
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,232
Nelson's always been
a hero of mine.

156
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,499
Didn't come from money.

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,265
Look what he
made of himself.

158
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,499
Our butler, Stafford,

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,165
noticed it was missing
at half past ten.

160
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,699
I was so shocked,
I burst into tears

161
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,399
in front of the whole party.

162
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,665
- I made such a fool of myself.
- No.

163
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,599
You didn't.

164
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,632
Besides,
who cares what they think?

165
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,332
As well as a guest list,

166
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,365
we'll need the names
of your staff

167
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,365
who were working that night.

168
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,299
I've spoken to my household.

169
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,399
Weren't any of them.

170
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,599
It was one of the guests.

171
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,565
I just know it.

172
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,165
Trying to teach me a lesson,
no doubt.

173
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,232
Daring to better myself.

174
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,632
And have you informed
the police?

175
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:01,799
What, and have all
London society questioned?

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,165
They'd resent us even more
than they do already.

177
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,965
There were
100 guests.

178
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,799
Only one of 'em
was a thief.

179
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,899
I want you to find
who stole from me--

180
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,499
discreetly.

181
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,965
And when you do,
I'll pay you handsomely.

182
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:15,965
Double your fee.

183
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,565
Is there anything
you wish to say?

184
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:31,165
Well, that was...
promising.

185
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,665
Apology accepted.

186
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,666
It was not an apology.

187
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,765
Go, giddy up!

188
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,999
You apologized?

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,832
Well, not in so many words.

190
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,999
Not in any words.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,199
I merely said
it was a promising start.

192
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,532
Double the normal fee.

193
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,099
I'd say that's
more than promising.

194
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,099
It may yet turn out they
arranged the theft themselves

195
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,465
to claim
an insurance payout.

196
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,865
If it was insurance fraud,

197
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,399
they'd have to report the theft
to the police.

198
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,132
Besides, they don't seem to be
short of money,

199
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,365
so I think a simple "well done,
Eliza" might be in order.

200
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,599
I'll save that until
the office is full again.

201
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,365
Your men decided to leave.

202
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,799
I did not make them.

203
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,265
Well, that's not what they said
in their correspondence.

204
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,932
They've been writing to you?

205
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,665
Well, I had hoped the situation
would rectify itself,

206
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,465
which is why
I didn't come back sooner.

207
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,366
But in the end, I had no choice.

208
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:18,965
Shall we concentrate
on the case?

209
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,932
I shall make some inquiries into
the Carters' household staff.

210
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,599
And I don't care
what Mr. Carter says.

211
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,665
It's more likely to be
a maid with sticky fingers

212
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,099
than some lord
with a grudge.
Mm.

213
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,965
I'll go through
the guest list for the party.

214
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:33,065
I have a copy of Perceval's
"Peerage and Nobility" at home.

215
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:36,265
Anyone who's anyone in high
society will be listed in it.

216
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:38,032
It may give us an idea
of who we're dealing with.

217
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,332
And I shall draw up a contract
for the Carter investigation.

218
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,399
Do you wish to see it
before I send it over?

219
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,465
Yes.
Yes.

220
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,765
Bring it to me when you're done.

221
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,932
I'm not here to make your life
difficult.

222
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,365
I'm here to help.

223
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,099
How long do you intend to stay?

224
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,133
As long as it takes.

225
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,199
I didn't hear you come in.

226
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,032
That's because
you were asleep.

227
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,299
And snoring.

228
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't snore.

229
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,065
Ivy will be back soon,
but I can make you something

230
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,265
to eat if you'd like.
Ah...

231
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,065
Can we please forgo the teasing
about my cooking?

232
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,800
It's not teasing-- you nearly
killed me with some eggs once.

233
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,665
Well...

234
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,565
You can't go wrong
with bread and jam.

235
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,966
And no, I did not make either.

236
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,033
Thank you.

237
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,432
So, how was your day?

238
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,332
For the most part, horrible.

239
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,865
You'll never believe
who's back in London.

240
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,465
Patrick Nash?

241
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,332
How do you know that?
Fitzroy.

242
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,932
He told me
during his daily visit.

243
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,665
I think that it's nice
he comes to see you each day.

244
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,665
You'll miss the attention
when you're back at work.

245
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,966
I'm in no rush to go back.

246
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,432
I'm serious.

247
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:23,632
The whole place
is falling apart.

248
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:27,266
To be honest, I've considered
not going back at all.

249
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,299
That job is everything to you.

250
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,632
Not everything.

251
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,832
You know,
this has made me realize

252
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,299
that there are other things
in life to consider.

253
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,332
Such as?

254
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,865
The future.

255
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,165
Your future's at Scotland Yard.

256
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,499
I don't think
that's ever been in question.

257
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,332
I'm not talking about work.

258
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,033
You know, the first time we met
was in this kitchen.

259
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,665
It was.

260
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,832
I remember watching you eat--
what was it?

261
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,532
Pork pie?

262
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,665
Smoked ham.

263
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,765
I can still remember
the look of horror on your face.

264
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,365
It wasn't horror,
it was fascination.

265
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,765
I'd never seen anyone
eat like that.

266
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,165
I still haven't.

267
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,632
That woman!

268
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,099
She'd try the patience
of a saint!

269
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,565
Your mother?
Who else?

270
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:30,765
Don't ask me about her gout.

271
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,465
I don't intend to.

272
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,765
But I'm sure William
would like to hear all about it,

273
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:38,365
while I have work to do.

274
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,965
Well, it's gone from her
right foot to her left foot.

275
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:45,399
Red, itchy skin all over
her big toe-- poor thing.

276
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,765
Morning.

277
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,132
I come with good news.

278
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,532
I went through
the list of guests

279
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,999
who attended
the Carters' party,

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,099
many of whom were in the
peerage listings in Perceval's,

281
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,465
and I believe I've found
something of interest

282
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,500
about one of the guests.

283
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,499
What kind of background checks
did you do on Jack Carter?

284
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,732
Oh, the usual:
name, address, occupation.

285
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:26,232
You didn't think to look into
where his money came from?

286
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:27,599
Textiles, as he said.

287
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,899
He owns a number of factories.

288
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,165
Which he bought
with the profits

289
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,566
from his original business.

290
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,999
Will you please just tell me
what's happened?

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,599
I went to see Carter's servants.

292
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,065
All were terrified
by the mere suggestion

293
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:44,365
they would have stolen from him,
but none would say why.

294
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,832
So, I did some digging.

295
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,232
It seems Mr. Carter
is from the most notorious

296
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:52,965
crime family
in the North of England.

297
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,699
Murder, extortion,
gun running.

298
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,832
All of which
you would have known,

299
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,065
had you done
your due diligence,

300
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,299
which, of course,
you couldn't

301
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,865
because you've lost
my entire staff!

302
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:03,399
They'd have researched
this Carter thug properly

303
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,932
and told you
to keep well clear.

304
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,865
Last night, I sent a telegram
to Mr. Carter

305
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,199
saying we were unable
to take his case

306
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,465
due to prior commitments.

307
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,532
Mr. Nash...
Just a moment!

308
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,765
This morning you and I
will sit down

309
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:13,865
and make a new
plan of action,

310
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,265
and then once we're through
with that...

311
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,899
Mr. Nash.

312
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,999
Apologies for
the interruption.

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,499
I do hope you are not busy.

314
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,265
I received your telegram.

315
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,965
It caused me some confusion,
so I thought it best to come

316
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:24,965
and talk to you in person.

317
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,565
Mr. Carter, if I...

318
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,565
No need to explain.

319
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,633
I can guess what's happened.

320
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,065
Just allow me to say my piece.

321
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,432
My wife and I
were the victims of theft.

322
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:45,732
There was a time when I would
have dealt with this myself.

323
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,632
But I've promised her that we
will deal with this in a manner

324
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:51,299
that is calm and civilized,

325
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,199
as any gentleman
might do.

326
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,832
I'm sure there are many other
investigation agencies

327
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,632
that would gladly
take your case.

328
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,099
Where I come from,
once you give your word,

329
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,199
you don't go back on it.

330
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,632
So, for the
avoidance of doubt,

331
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:07,300
you will take this case
and you will find my jewel.

332
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,932
If we cannot?

333
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:14,632
Then I will hold you
personally responsible.

334
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,199
Oh, and you'll do it
for free.

335
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,233
As compensation for the insult
to my character.

336
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:40,965
Not... a... word.

337
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,965
We need to find that thief.

338
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,299
And what will Mr. Carter do
once you find him?

339
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,565
That had not yet occurred to me,
Clarence,

340
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:53,265
but thank you for making
a dire situation

341
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,433
even more unsatisfactory.

342
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,465
We are where we are.

343
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:05,332
So let's just do our best
and try and solve the case.

344
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,733
Agreed?

345
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,665
You mentioned you'd found
something of interest.

346
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,865
Indeed I did.

347
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,632
The diamond feather
was put up for auction last year

348
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,165
by Admiral Nelson's family.

349
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,532
From what I gather, they did so
somewhat reluctantly,

350
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:21,899
due to falling on hard times.

351
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,665
They've been forced to sell
many of the family's

352
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,865
prized possessions.
Precisely.

353
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:27,699
As I was going through the list
of guests

354
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,765
who attended the Carters' party,
I came across a Lord Fallon.

355
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:33,099
He and his wife are patrons
of a charity

356
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,199
that help retired sailors
from the Royal Navy.

357
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,565
Turns out

358
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:41,199
Lord Fallon has a link
on his mother's side

359
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,065
to Admiral Horatio Nelson.

360
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:47,232
Fallon is Nelson's
cousin?

361
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,432
Which gives him motive
and opportunity

362
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:51,165
to claim back
a treasured family heirloom.

363
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,765
Hmm.

364
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,399
We should pay him a visit.

365
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,732
We should.

366
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,733
But we'll need a cover story.

367
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,299
My wife and I have always been
patrons of the arts.

368
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,965
It was her idea that we come
to take tea with you,

369
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,499
Lord and Lady Fallon,

370
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,265
and that we might learn more
of your own charitable works.

371
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:13,832
It is always a pleasure
to welcome new benefactors.

372
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,765
Thank you for considering us.

373
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:17,532
She is such a selfless person.

374
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:18,665
She's always thinking of others.

375
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,132
Do not listen
to my dear husband.

376
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,965
It is he who thinks of all
but himself.

377
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:26,400
Never was there a, a kinder,
more honorable man.

378
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,932
You are newly arrived
in London?

379
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,465
I do not believe our paths
have crossed before.

380
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,999
We have, until recently,
been in the West Indies,

381
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,065
where we have
some business interests.

382
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:40,499
But we have, I believe,
some mutual acquaintances.

383
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,965
A Mr. and Mrs. Carter.

384
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,732
They are friends of yours?

385
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,565
Business acquaintances.

386
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,399
I hear the Carters' charity ball
was a roaring success,

387
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,599
although ended in
somewhat sad circumstances.

388
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,132
Mm.
The theft.

389
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,899
It was a shame indeed.

390
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,899
Poor Mrs. Carter had put much
work into the event,

391
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,832
and for it to end
in such a way...

392
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,499
She made a damn fool
of herself.

393
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,099
Dearest.
What?

394
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,565
She did.

395
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,365
That husband of hers
is no better.

396
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,332
Uncouth, the pair of them.

397
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,199
Perhaps this is not
the time nor the place...

398
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,465
Do not presume to tell me

399
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,032
what I can and cannot say

400
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:18,465
in my own home, madam.

401
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,299
Perhaps we might return

402
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,199
to this donation you mentioned.

403
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,065
Uh, your charity is,
I believe,

404
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,199
in support of the elderly
and infirm sailors

405
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,199
of the Royal Navy.

406
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,899
That is correct.

407
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,165
Which is apt,
given your connection

408
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,432
to the greatest hero
this country's ever seen:

409
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,965
Admiral Horatio Nelson.

410
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,199
Goodness.

411
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,432
Well, in that case,

412
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:46,765
the theft of the
admiral's diamond feather

413
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,165
must have dismayed you
more than most,

414
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,832
given it's practically
a family heirloom.

415
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,232
I'd hardly call
a distant cousin family.

416
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:57,532
And as for the theft,
I know exactly who stole it.

417
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,532
Who?
Who?

418
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,699
We do love a little gossip
now and then.

419
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,432
Baroness Weichmann.

420
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:08,899
Dreadful woman-- always
scratching around for handouts.

421
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,865
I heard she was trying to

422
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,899
pay for her passage
back to Prussia.

423
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,899
Riddled with debts, that one.

424
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,799
This Prussian baroness
is worth a visit.

425
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,832
Fallon clearly
loathes the woman.

426
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,365
He strikes me as someone
who likes very few,

427
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:25,965
including his own wife.

428
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,299
Did you see the bruises
on her neck?

429
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,732
It was him, no doubt.

430
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,932
Why are you looking
at me like that?

431
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,465
We didn't want to disturb you,
sir.

432
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,899
You looked so peaceful.

433
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,632
Like a little boy.

434
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:56,399
I don't need your help,
thank you.

435
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,099
Yes, sir, sorry, sir.

436
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,932
He's always like this
when he first wakes up.

437
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,432
I'll go and fetch
some tea and cake.

438
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:04,432
No cake, Ivy.

439
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,300
Nonsense.

440
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:14,565
If I don't get out of here soon,
I'm going to run to fat.

441
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:16,765
Well, whatever Ivy's feeding
you, it's doing you good.

442
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,532
Each day, you look
a little better.

443
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:19,999
Yes.

444
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,099
On that, Oliver, you don't have
to visit me every day.

445
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,932
But I look forward to it, sir.

446
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,132
Unless you'd prefer I didn't?

447
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,899
Of course not.

448
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,332
So...

449
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,365
Important day.

450
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,665
Yes, sir.

451
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,032
The American Embassy awaits.

452
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,332
I want this secondment
more than anything.

453
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,232
It's quite the opportunity.

454
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,799
New York!

455
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,032
Imagine that.

456
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:47,932
And an ocean between
you and your father

457
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,199
has its benefits,
no doubt.

458
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,233
Never occurred to me.

459
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,732
I have to make a speech
to the ambassador's staff.

460
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,299
I hoped to share it with you.

461
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,865
My advice is, don't bore them.

462
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,365
Make it short and to the point.

463
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:04,999
My thoughts exactly, sir.

464
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:16,999
We could not believe it
when we heard you were looking

465
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,565
to sell your splendid estate,
Baroness,

466
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:21,265
since my wife and I are eager
to buy in this area.

467
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,099
Yes, how did you hear of it?

468
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,799
Oh, Lord Fallon mentioned it
in passing.

469
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,199
Mm-hmm.

470
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,365
I'm a keen horsewoman,
and, uh, it's so very rare

471
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:31,665
to find such a grand house
in the middle of London...

472
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,499
Mm-hmm.
...with stables to boot.

473
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,399
Well, it was not my intention

474
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,265
to let things fall
into such disrepair.

475
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:39,799
Expensive to upkeep, too,
I'd imagine.

476
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,432
How much exactly
were you looking to offer?

477
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,132
Oh, finance is my husband's
department, Baroness.

478
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,532
Mmm.

479
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,765
I rarely understand it
and find it quite tiresome,

480
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,199
and said very much the same
to my great friend

481
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,599
Mrs. Maisie Carter
just the other day.

482
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,832
Oh, you know the Carters?

483
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,065
I say "friend."

484
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,365
Given the chasm
between our social standing,

485
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:01,899
she is perhaps more of
an acquaintance.

486
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,499
But my heart
does go out to her.

487
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,765
Did you hear about the theft
of their diamond feather?

488
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,765
Madam?

489
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,232
You have a visitor.

490
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:17,565
I do apologize,

491
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:20,365
but I must see to my guest.

492
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:23,265
Let us carry this negotiation on
some other time.

493
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:26,732
My maid will let you know
when I'm next available.

494
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,565
Good day.

495
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:30,332
Baroness.

496
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,232
Patrick...

497
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,999
Do you know him?

498
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,265
Mr. Gibson...

499
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,665
He's a dealer.

500
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,532
In what?

501
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:43,500
Stolen art and jewelry.

502
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,299
Clarence.

503
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,399
I need information
on a second-rate art dealer.

504
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,832
A Mr. Gibson.

505
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,699
I think you ought
to see this first.

506
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,165
Who sent this?

507
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,165
I don't know.

508
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,732
There's no name or signature.

509
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:07,232
It must have been posted when
I went out to buy my luncheon.

510
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,865
"The diamond feather you seek
can be found

511
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:12,332
in Lord Fallon's writing desk."

512
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,299
I was in the middle
of my speech,

513
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,365
just getting into my stride,
and they told me to stop.

514
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,400
Whiskey, Ivy.

515
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,532
I tried to put my case
forward,

516
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,732
but they dismissed me
out of hand.

517
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:28,332
It was a
golden opportunity.

518
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,299
In New York, I could have been
anyone I wanted to be.

519
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,999
No one there knows me
or who my father is.

520
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,632
It could have been
a fresh start.

521
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:38,833
Did they give a reason?

522
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,432
Lack of experience, apparently.

523
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:43,832
It sounds like they're hoping
for someone

524
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,799
with more years of service,
such as yourself, sir.

525
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,265
Are you trying to
get rid of me, Detective?

526
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:50,833
Oh, of course not, sir.

527
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:57,032
You can always apply
again next year.

528
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,965
Just, just be patient.

529
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:00,999
You're right, sir.

530
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,066
You're always right.

531
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,599
I'd best get back.

532
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,999
The files keep rolling in

533
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,999
and I don't want Phelps
to accuse me of shirking.

534
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,532
Thank you, Miss Woods.

535
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,732
- Pleasure, Detective.

536
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,432
Oliver?

537
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:20,999
You're a good copper.

538
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,499
Don't forget that.

539
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,965
Thank you, sir.

540
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,232
That boy thinks
the world of you.

541
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,432
You'll make a good father.

542
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,065
Would you like family
of your own one day?

543
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:42,599
Can I speak my mind?

544
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,432
Will I need another whiskey?

545
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:45,799
Mm-hmm.

546
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,299
Given what you've
just been through,

547
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,865
I'm sure you don't need me
to tell you this,

548
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,032
but life is short--
don't waste it.

549
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,365
I don't know what happened

550
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,499
between you and Arabella,

551
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,433
but I can take a good guess
at the reason why it ended.

552
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:19,133
So don't you think
it's about time you told her?

553
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,799
Told who?

554
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,565
I bribed one of the maids
as she was leaving.

555
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:37,065
Housekeeper
has the night off

556
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,165
and the Fallons are due
to go to the theater.

557
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:42,299
So, once they've left,
the house will be empty.

558
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:45,232
It can't be this easy,
can it?

559
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:48,065
A note just
miraculously tells us

560
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,665
where the diamond feather
is hidden.

561
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,232
Well, we have to
at least investigate.

562
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:55,899
Besides, Lord Fallon strikes me
as a man with plenty of enemies.

563
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,099
Speaking of notes,

564
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,999
what did your men say about me
in their letters?

565
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,199
I think it's best just
to leave that be.

566
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,832
And, for the record,
it was not your fault.

567
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,865
Thank you, Patrick.
It was mine.

568
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:13,465
I should never have left you
in charge.

569
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:14,865
What?!

570
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,033
Hup.

571
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,765
What do you mean you should
never have left me in charge?

572
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,999
This is not the time.

573
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,932
Let's find his desk.

574
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,465
See if the note was right.

575
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:47,532
Your men resigned because they
didn't want to work for a woman.

576
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,799
I didn't dismiss
a single one of them.

577
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,965
Apart from Matthews?

578
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:52,299
He was taking
three hours for lunch.

579
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,899
And Simpson?
I didn't care
for his manner.

580
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,065
But aside from those two,
I bear no responsibility.

581
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,732
And Peters?
Fine.

582
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,865
I did dismiss some of them,
and I don't regret it.

583
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:03,265
Good, 'cause they told me
they would have left anyway.

584
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,099
What?
Well, don't shoot
the messenger.

585
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:07,899
Someone's coming.

586
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,199
This way.

587
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,965
Shall I have a look?
See who it is?

588
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:26,199
Do what you want--
you always do anyway.

589
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,132
This is no time to sulk!

590
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,766
I'm not sulking!

591
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,532
Ah.

592
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,165
If the diamond feather
was in Fallon's desk,

593
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,900
someone else has it now.

594
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:24,465
What time did you
come home last night?

595
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:26,900
I wasn't aware
you were my father.

596
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:31,999
I had, uh, I'd hoped to speak
to you, that's all.

597
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,699
About what?
If this is about you going home,

598
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,032
you're not well enough yet.

599
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,299
No, it's not that.

600
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,099
Oh, I know what it is.
No, you don't.

601
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,265
But if you would just
listen for a moment...

602
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,199
It's Detective Fitzroy,
isn't it?

603
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,532
He's told you who my client is--
I do not need you lecturing me

604
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:46,532
about my safety, William.
Eliza, will you please,

605
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,565
for once, just listen to what
I have to say?

606
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:52,732
Why? Who is your client?

607
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,199
Are you in danger?

608
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,799
Now's not the time, William.

609
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,799
I really must be
getting to work.

610
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,965
If Lord Fallon did steal
the diamond feather,

611
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:17,232
then who stole it from him?

612
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,365
And we still need
to find out

613
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,532
who sent the anonymous
letter.

614
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,100
Agreed.

615
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,732
How curious-- we're halfway
through the morning,

616
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:27,265
and there's yet to be
a cross word between us.

617
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,799
It's still early, Patrick.

618
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,132
I have a list of dealers who
trade in stolen luxury goods,

619
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:35,299
but I'm yet to find anything
on a Mr. Gibson.

620
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,699
Leave it with me.

621
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,965
I have an idea
where we might find him.

622
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:53,099
Mr. Gibson, isn't it?

623
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,632
Who wants to know?

624
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:56,865
I'm a colleague
of Inspector Wellington.

625
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:59,199
I believe you once
assisted him on a case.

626
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,032
I've never heard of him.

627
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,265
Oh, really?

628
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:04,965
I must be mistaken.

629
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,600
Perhaps I should go
and fetch him.

630
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,299
Uh, now, come to think of it,
I do remember the inspector.

631
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,999
I thought you might.

632
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,965
So, how can I help you?

633
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,833
What's your business
with Baroness Weichmann?

634
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:22,332
I've never heard of her.

635
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:25,832
I saw you meet her
at her stables.

636
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,999
Oh.

637
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,765
She's requested your help

638
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:31,899
to sell a stolen artifact,
perhaps.

639
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,299
I can assure you,

640
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,032
I trade only
in legitimate goods,

641
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,499
sold with full provenance.

642
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,965
Well, that's curious,

643
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:40,765
since Inspector Wellington
was quite sure that you did

644
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:44,433
indeed trade in stolen goods.

645
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,132
Perhaps I should go
and fetch him after all,

646
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,499
to clear this muddle up.

647
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,165
Well, the, the baroness has
offered no stolen goods.

648
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,232
But I do pay her
a small commission

649
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:54,565
to bring me
wealthy ladies looking

650
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:58,432
to sell their possessions--
discreetly.

651
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,632
Often without the knowledge
of their husbands.

652
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:01,799
And has the baroness
earned her commission

653
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,366
and provided you
with any clients?

654
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,399
I've got a meeting with one
of them today at noon.

655
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,600
Who might this lucky lady be?

656
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,232
Her name's Fallon.

657
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,266
Lady Emily Fallon.

658
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,765
He assured me he'd come to the
office immediately

659
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,299
after his meeting
with Lady Fallon

660
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,999
and confirm what it was
she wishes to sell.

661
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,599
Do you trust him?

662
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,565
Not remotely.
Nevertheless,

663
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:27,932
it's the best lead
we have.

664
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,165
Agreed.

665
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,699
Can you stop agreeing
with me?

666
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,232
It's most disconcerting.

667
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,565
Good afternoon.

668
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,366
It's Mr. Stafford,
isn't it?

669
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,499
We have visitors.

670
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,365
Yes, thank you, Clarence.

671
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:56,099
Nice to see you again,
Miss Scarlet, Mr. Nash.

672
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,765
So sorry to turn up
without an appointment.

673
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,632
We were just on our way
to luncheon round the corner.

674
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:03,165
Jack's taking me to Gilbert's.

675
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,732
And as we were passing,
I thought

676
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:07,432
why not drop in and get
an update on the case?

677
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,832
Please be assured

678
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,065
it has our full attention,

679
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:11,565
and as soon as we have
any developments,

680
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:13,999
you'll be the first to know.

681
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,465
Hm.

682
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:17,465
Stafford,

683
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,633
take Mrs. Carter
to the carriage.

684
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:24,299
So nice to see you again.

685
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
Mrs. Carter.

686
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:45,132
Word has got back to my family
that someone has stolen from me.

687
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,999
My brothers are dining out
on how funny that is.

688
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,699
And I don't like to be
laughed at, Mr. Nash.

689
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,499
Yes, I can see that.

690
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,999
So, you're gonna tell me
everything

691
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,365
you've found out so far.

692
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:58,332
We're still following up on
different lines of inquiry.

693
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,332
I want names,
and addresses, and...

694
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,099
Jack! We're going to be late.

695
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,500
Just coming, my darling.

696
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:17,500
You've got one more day.

697
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:42,665
I'm going to the market.

698
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:45,832
I'll pick you up some nice
pork chops for your dinner.

699
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,665
Ivy...

700
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,266
Do you have any writing paper?

701
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:55,365
Top drawer, right-hand side.

702
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,233
You'll find a pen in there, too.

703
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,500
Mm-hmm.

704
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:34,266
Convey my...

705
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,166
Convey?

706
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,533
For God's sake.

707
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:52,365
Our only lead is this
crooked art dealer.

708
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,665
And if he's let us down,

709
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,565
tomorrow we'll face Carter
empty-handed.

710
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:58,232
If his meeting with Lady Fallon
was at noon,

711
00:35:58,233 --> 00:35:59,499
he should have been here
by now.

712
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,932
Please stop pacing,
you're making me nervous.

713
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,065
Good-- I don't see
why I should suffer alone.

714
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,532
I've brought some lunch!

715
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:07,265
Not now, Clarence.

716
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,899
Miss Scarlet and I are waiting
for this Gibson fellow,

717
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,632
even though there's a strong
possibility he will not show.

718
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,865
If he doesn't,
it's not my fault.
All of this is your fault.

719
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:16,132
Does this Mr. Gibson
wear spectacles?
Yes.

720
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,265
And possess an abundant
head of hair?

721
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:20,299
Yes.

722
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,165
And does he have a somewhat
pained expression,

723
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,132
presumably due
to a nervous disposition?

724
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:25,265
Yes.
Yes.

725
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,733
Hm-- he's outside.

726
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,132
You took your time.

727
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:39,100
You have news on Lady Fallon?

728
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:46,099
She's seeking to finance
a divorce from her husband.

729
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,499
She got rooms
at the Brabham Hotel.

730
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,999
Marlborough Suite.

731
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,199
Wants to meet there later,
give me what she has to sell.

732
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,632
What exactly is it
that she wants to sell?

733
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:57,532
Admiral Nelson's
diamond feather.

734
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,632
It's possible that Lord Fallon
did steal the jewel

735
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:11,765
from Mr. Carter, but then what?

736
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:14,465
Lady Fallon stole it
from her own husband?

737
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,399
Hm, perhaps.

738
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,366
But we still need to find out
who sent the anonymous note.

739
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,999
As requested,
I checked at the Brabham.

740
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,232
The Marlborough Suite is indeed

741
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,199
where Lady Fallon regularly
visits.

742
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,299
But the rooms are not paid for
by her or her husband.

743
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,699
Well, who does pay for them?

744
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,665
Jack Carter.

745
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,932
So Lady Fallon and Carter

746
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:37,965
are having an affair?

747
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:39,699
Does that make sense to you?

748
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,265
Very little surprises me
anymore.

749
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:44,199
I'm going to take another look
at Carter's file,

750
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,432
see if I can make any other
connection to the Fallons.

751
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:57,365
Eliza.

752
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:59,065
William, what are
you doing here?

753
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,032
You should be at home, resting.

754
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,833
Yes.

755
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:06,499
I wanted to speak to you.

756
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,366
I did attempt to this morning.

757
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,065
Sorry, you just make me nervous
when you start to question me.

758
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:14,399
But it was about
my current investigation.

759
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,500
No, it's about something
else entirely.

760
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:23,765
Something that I need
to get off my chest.

761
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:26,865
But as a man ill at ease with
getting things off his chest,

762
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:28,232
I thought the best thing might
be to, um...

763
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,499
To...

764
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:34,332
Gibson's just sent a message.

765
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,932
He's meeting
Lady Fallon at 4:00.

766
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:38,299
Well, that's in 20 minutes.

767
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,265
Mr. Nash is hailing down
a cab.

768
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,033
Um...

769
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:47,332
This can wait-- you go.

770
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,865
Well...

771
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:50,799
Given you're clearly
feeling a little better,

772
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,865
perhaps dinner this evening?

773
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,465
I'll make a reservation
at Gilbert's.

774
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:57,065
We'll talk then.

775
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,500
I'll be home by 8:00, I promise.

776
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,166
You are in love with her.

777
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,100
Unless you can
convince me otherwise.

778
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,300
Well, I wish you luck.

779
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,165
And I say this out of
friendship, not malice.

780
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,799
Eliza's ambition
will outweigh everything,

781
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,032
even her feelings for you.

782
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,432
Nothing will ever be enough
for her.

783
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:10,266
Certainly not the future
you envisage.

784
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,466
Lady Fallon?

785
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,032
We know you have
the diamond feather.

786
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:04,399
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

787
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,700
You kept it hidden here.

788
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:11,865
And this is where you
plan to sell it.

789
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:14,532
No, no, don't!

790
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,199
Myself and Emily-- Lady Fallon--

791
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,499
we met through the
Mayfair ladies' society

792
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,900
and found we were both as
unhappily married as each other.

793
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:32,732
Funny, innit?

794
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:37,065
My husband wants to be accepted
by the likes of Lord Fallon.

795
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:41,299
A man who beats his wife
when he's had one too many.

796
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,699
You needed money to fund
a divorce,

797
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,865
so you stole
the diamond feather.

798
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:48,900
It was me who stole it.

799
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,965
I wanted to help Emily, but
I also wanted to punish Jack.

800
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:56,765
I never even wanted
to move to London.

801
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:58,965
I was happy where we were.

802
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:00,999
Where we both grew up.

803
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,799
We belonged.

804
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,199
And all I've had since
I've come

805
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,566
to this city
is rejection and contempt.

806
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:16,133
And Emily's the only one who's
ever shown me any kindness.

807
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:24,832
After the party, my husband had
had too much to drink,

808
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,933
and when Maisie saw my bruises,
she was upset.

809
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,732
She was meant
to give me the jewel,

810
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:39,199
but instead, she put it
in my husband's desk

811
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,632
and sent you the note.

812
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:43,732
I hoped you would
tell Jack

813
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:46,132
and he would deal with Fallon
once and for all.

814
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,265
With any luck,

815
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,532
Emily wouldn't have to suffer
the humiliation of a divorce

816
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,866
and instead she would
be a widow.

817
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:59,599
My husband is,
oh, he is many things.

818
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,600
But I did not want his death
on my conscience.

819
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,166
So you stole it back
from the desk.

820
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,699
If you tell Jack
any of this...

821
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,199
Well, God knows
what he'll do to me.

822
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,633
To both of us.

823
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:25,299
What do we tell Carter?

824
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,599
We can't tell him the truth,
that's for sure.

825
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,399
But if we don't hand them over,
Carter will come after us.

826
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,032
And I know it's selfish
of me,

827
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:33,000
but I'd very much like
to carry on living.

828
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,432
What is it?

829
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:41,199
Carter's a wealthy man.

830
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,199
He could live anywhere
in the country,

831
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,865
and yet he chose to move
to London,

832
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:47,965
to join gentlemen's clubs
and mix with lords and ladies.

833
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,432
Why would he do that?

834
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:52,499
Why are we discussing
this now, exactly?

835
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,099
The answer is because
he wants to belong.

836
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,032
Is this you formulating
a plan?

837
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:02,332
If so, I do hope my survival
is factored into it.

838
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,899
I never doubted you
for a minute.

839
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,199
Now tell me.

840
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,965
Who took it?

841
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,899
Neither myself
nor Miss Scarlet

842
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,666
will be giving you
that information.

843
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,666
We've returned what is stolen,
which is an end to the matter.

844
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:43,365
I will ask once more.

845
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:45,732
And it will be the last time
I do so politely.

846
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:49,665
We're more than aware of
the threat you pose, Mr. Carter.

847
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:53,132
Making people disappear is a
speciality of yours, I believe.

848
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,332
A publican in Leeds.

849
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,665
A dock worker in Hull.

850
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:01,932
There are others, too--
it's all in here.

851
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,532
You can keep this.

852
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,199
We've made numerous copies
of the same documents.

853
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,399
They're currently in a secret
location and will be released

854
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,699
should any harm come to myself
or Mr. Nash.

855
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,232
You think the police don't
know this already?

856
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:14,465
A bunch of rumor and hearsay?

857
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:17,299
If there were any evidence,
I'd be in prison.

858
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,765
Well, it's not the police
we'd send it to.

859
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:21,265
It's the guests
who attended your party.

860
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,165
You chose to move to London,

861
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:27,865
to mix amongst the great
and the good.

862
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:30,965
Like your hero, Admiral Nelson,
you wish to rise

863
00:45:30,966 --> 00:45:32,932
to the very top of society.

864
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:35,600
But that will never happen
if they know who you really are.

865
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,332
Rumor and hearsay have destroyed

866
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,100
greater men than you,
Mr. Carter.

867
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,099
However,

868
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,499
it's our wish that your
reputation remain intact,

869
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,266
and that none of those you wish
to impress learn any of this.

870
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,400
We will, of course,
be expecting our fee.

871
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,999
Or, rather,
double our fee, as agreed.

872
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,333
Splendid.

873
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,965
Well, then, we shall bid you
good day-- Mr. Nash?

874
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,832
Oh, I wish you'd been
there, Clarence.

875
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,832
Carter didn't stand a chance.

876
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,632
To getting double our fee!

877
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:36,000
That is quite something,
Miss Scarlet-- well done.

878
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,199
Thank you, Clarence.

879
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,232
That may be the first compliment
you've ever given me.

880
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,132
Oh, well!

881
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,465
I shall endeavor not to make
a habit of it.

882
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:48,299
If you'll excuse me,

883
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,800
I'll go and add our latest fee
to the balance sheet.

884
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:02,132
Of all those who wrote
to me about you,

885
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,533
Clarence was the
most complimentary.

886
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:07,599
Well, as complimentary
as he can ever be.

887
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:11,865
It's just a shame
my men didn't...

888
00:47:11,866 --> 00:47:13,232
We're having a moment of
harmony, Patrick.

889
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,599
Please do not ruin it.

890
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,032
I was going to say,
it's just a shame

891
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,032
my men didn't see you
as I do.

892
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:20,265
As an exceptional detective

893
00:47:20,266 --> 00:47:22,965
and a remarkable woman.

894
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:32,300
I should have stayed here
until you'd settled in.

895
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:35,765
So, I must take
some responsibility

896
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:37,100
for what happened.

897
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:39,932
Perhaps there were times where

898
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:41,699
I was a little high-handed
with your men.

899
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:48,965
What say we start again?

900
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:51,399
We'll hire new staff.

901
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,665
I'll fund it with the money
from the Paris branch

902
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,199
and stay until things
are running smoothly.

903
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,599
And we'll make Nash and Sons
great once more.

904
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,865
With your brains

905
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:05,300
and my good looks,
I mean, how can we fail?

906
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:09,600
Oh, no.

907
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:13,066
Sorry, Patrick, I must go.

908
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:23,400
Thank you.

909
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:33,465
William?

910
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:01,532
Where are you going?

911
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:02,832
You're not well enough
to go home yet!

912
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,866
I'm not going home.

913
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,699
I've been to see the super
and he's agreed.

914
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,499
I'm going to New York.

915
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,532
I'm taking the secondment.

916
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:17,665
For a year?

917
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:20,833
For a year.

918
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:23,865
Well...

919
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:26,865
This is because I was late
for dinner?

920
00:49:26,866 --> 00:49:31,099
No.

921
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,765
This is because I love you.

922
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:40,499
It's a rare occurrence

923
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,932
that I cause you
to be speechless.

924
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:44,166
Perhaps I should tell you
that I love you more often.

925
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,900
Well, you, you love me,
and yet you're leaving?

926
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:56,265
Something has to change, Eliza.

927
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:58,365
Perhaps for you,

928
00:49:58,366 --> 00:50:02,365
perhaps for me.

929
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:06,932
This will, uh, give us the time
to consider our options.

930
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:09,565
I, I don't understand.
Yes, you do.

931
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:13,165
If we are to be together,

932
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:15,965
then I cannot remain
at Scotland Yard

933
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:18,232
with you a private detective.

934
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:24,199
Nor can I be around you anymore
without,

935
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,900
without being with you.

936
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:35,499
You have put me
in an impossible situation.

937
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,832
So, this is my fault?

938
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:41,166
Yes.

939
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:13,232
This isn't goodbye.

940
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,966
It's goodbye for now.

941
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,199
You've not spoken
of Inspector Wellington

942
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,432
since he's been gone.

943
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:22,165
You're clearly upset and angry
with him.

944
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,965
I'm not upset,
nor am I angry.

945
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:25,465
If you are to run this agency,

946
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:26,999
you must first and foremost
be a businesswoman.

947
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,332
I'll not be returning
to Paris

948
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:31,432
until you convince me
you understand this.
