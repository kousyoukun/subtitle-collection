1
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:03,999
My name is Eliza Scarlet.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,365
I'm a private detective.

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,665
And, please, don't say,
"You're a what?"

4
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,932
I'm running
this London office now,

5
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,199
and I can assure you,
things will pick up.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,232
We have exactly no clients.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,732
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

8
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,865
No sniffing around or digging.

9
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:19,065
I'm not a dog, William.

10
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,599
What have you done?!

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,732
You look tired.
You look beautiful.

12
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,765
Here at Nash and Sons,

13
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,632
we offer the most professional
of services.

14
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,232
And I do not boast when I say
that these past few months

15
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,499
under my leadership
have seen even greater success.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,999
A woman, no less, at the helm

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,765
of London's most esteemed
private detective agency.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,832
Eliza Scarlet,
chief investigator.

19
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,465
One T in Scarlet,
Mr. Godfrey.

20
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:17,865
Ah.

21
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:21,965
As you can see, my success here
speaks for itself.

22
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,265
Sorry to disturb you,

23
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,165
Miss Scarlet,
but I need your sign-off

24
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,332
on the Whitlock case
investigation.

25
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,032
Of course.

26
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,465
Another successful conclusion
to one of our many cases.

27
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,899
And if you could ensure
that our address is placed

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,965
somewhere prominent
in the article, Mr. Godfrey.

29
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,332
How many times?

30
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,032
It's the Whitlock case
or the Whitlock investigation,

31
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,032
not both.

32
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,332
I was not hired by Mr. Nash

33
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,532
to pretend to be
a private detective.

34
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:55,799
So you said, three times.

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,232
Thank you, everyone.

36
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,099
You know the drill by now.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,665
Miss Scarlet,
may I speak my mind?
No.

38
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,532
I know it's not ideal
that Mr. Nash's entire

39
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,265
staff of men have
left you.
Thank you...

40
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,832
Deserted is more
an appropriate term.

41
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,199
But whilst he's in Paris,

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,599
it is my number-one
responsibility

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,265
to make sure his business
is financially viable.

44
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,565
As it is mine--
thank you.

45
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,599
So, so, as his accountant,
I must advise you

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,932
in the strongest
possible terms

47
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:20,199
that this, this financial
practice is not prudent.

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,899
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Scarlet.

49
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,165
I know what I'm doing,
Clarence.

50
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,765
Really?

51
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,032
Really? Because,
because hiring actors

52
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,499
to pretend to be detectives
tells me otherwise!

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,065
So, I've done some sums.

54
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,265
And our financial situation

55
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,900
is not as bad
as we first thought.

56
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,232
It is worse.

57
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,499
Hence my reservations

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,865
at hiring actors
who purport to be employees.

59
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,332
It's a waste of money.
It's not.

60
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,732
"The Illustrated Police News"
will publish an article

61
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:31,832
declaring our success

62
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,265
since Mr. Nash
left me in charge.

63
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,965
This, in turn,
will attract more clients.

64
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,065
The term "more" implies
we already have a full roster.

65
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:40,365
But the last time I checked,
we have exactly

66
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:41,832
no clients.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,599
I do not wish to lay blame

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,932
squarely at your door...

69
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,899
Good, because the fact
they didn't want a woman

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,865
running their accounts is a
question of biology, not fault.

71
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:52,399
And the same goes for
Mr. Nash's staff of men.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,565
My recollection is that
Mr. Nash's men left

73
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,065
because of the manner
in which you dealt with them.

74
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,799
Half of them never returned
after their lunch

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,132
and the other half strolled
into work when it suited.

76
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,832
I was trying to run
a tighter ship.

77
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,599
Well, Mr. Nash's way

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,099
was a little more respectful.

79
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,633
Clarence, need I remind you
that he's not here anymore?

80
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,999
I'm running
this London office now,

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,733
and I can assure you,
things will pick up.

82
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,399
If you say so.

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,433
I do.

84
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,832
Get me the files on the
local talent from Felton Street

85
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,365
to Bridge Lane,
anyone handy with a knife.

86
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,599
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,932
You track down the dead man's
relatives,

88
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,099
inform them of the stabbing.
Straightaway, sir.

89
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,665
Hey, Duke...
Not now.

90
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,232
Sir!

91
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,165
Not now!

92
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:42,699
All right, let's get started.

93
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,799
I said, quiet!

94
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,465
Now, I know this last month
has been difficult...

95
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,965
Diabolical, more like.

96
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,832
But it has just been
confirmed that,

97
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,365
as well as the additional areas
in Essex and Kent,

98
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,765
we'll now be policing
further districts

99
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,999
in Surrey and Middlesex, too.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,165
Bloody hell, skipper,

101
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,566
we're flat-out as it is.

102
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,365
To cope with demand,
all leave will be canceled

103
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,065
and double shifts
implemented.

104
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,365
I said not now!

105
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,300
It's urgent, sir.
What's this?

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,399
Get to it, then.

107
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,000
Fitzroy, Phelps.

108
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,932
Listen, if I want your opinion,
Charlie, I will ask for it.

109
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,699
I'm not telling you
to do anything

110
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,899
that I'm not
already doing myself.

111
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,599
I haven't been home for days.

112
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,832
I know, skipper-- sorry.

113
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,899
Right, there's been a shooting
in Mayfair.

114
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,432
Sounds like an armed robbery.

115
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:41,899
It's that place at the end
of Turner Street.

116
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,732
The Temple of Elysium.

117
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,165
Elysium?

118
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,366
Is it a theater?

119
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,165
No, son.

120
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,332
It ain't no theater.

121
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:04,099
Hello, handsome.

122
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,499
I've already given
my statement to the officer

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,399
that was here earlier,
as did my girls.

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,765
I really must insist
that they be allowed home.

125
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,332
They've been working all night.

126
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,665
Well, that is as may be,
but I need you and them

127
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,332
to tell me
the chain of events.

128
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,265
So, an armed gunman
entered the brothel...

129
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,899
It's not a brothel.

130
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,932
It is an elite gentlemen's club.

131
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:32,599
An armed gunman entered
the elite gentlemen's club,

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,365
robbed it, then shot
one of your punters.

133
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:39,065
A gunman came
through the entrance.

134
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,565
He held our watchman

135
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,232
at gunpoint and demanded
that he tie himself up.

136
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:48,065
Then he went from bedroom
to bedroom robbing my clients.

137
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:51,932
My watchman managed
to untie himself.

138
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,232
And then he went outside
calling for help,

139
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:59,232
instead of tackling the gunman
and protecting me and my girls,

140
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,665
which is what
he's paid to do.

141
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,099
You'll need to come
to the station

142
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,432
to make a statement, sir.

143
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,332
I need a description
of the gunman.

144
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,365
A black scarf
covering his face,

145
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:12,299
shabby cloth cap
and overcoat,

146
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,266
average height,
fair hair, and blue eyes.

147
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,665
We'll need to talk

148
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,699
to your punters, too.

149
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,132
Well, they've all left.

150
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:25,365
This is a private club,
Detective.

151
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,899
Gentlemen come
to the Temple of Elysium

152
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,532
to enjoy some discreet time
with one of my goddesses.

153
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,132
Not to be part of

154
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,599
some police investigation.

155
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,499
On that, were you aware
that Greek goddesses

156
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,865
actually lived on Mount Olympus,
not Elysium?

157
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:42,865
Elysium was a paradise

158
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:44,832
for warriors
favored by the gods.

159
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,132
I mean, there may have been
some women there...

160
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,199
Yes, thank you for the lesson,
Detective Fitzroy.

161
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,765
Fascinating, I'm sure.

162
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,532
What about the punter
who was shot?

163
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,633
They are not punters!

164
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:00,532
They are gentleman callers.

165
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:04,499
So, this gentleman caller

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,765
was sleeping off
some overindulgence

167
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,432
and the intruder
tried to rob him,

168
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,565
and a fight ensued.

169
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,766
Which I assume is why
the fella got shot.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,999
So...

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199
Who tended to him?

172
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,799
One of my girls happened
to be with a doctor.

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,065
He examined him and
took him off to hospital.

174
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,432
And what did this doctor say
about his injuries?

175
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,432
I never asked.

176
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,499
Which hospital was he taken to?

177
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,899
I never asked.

178
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,232
What was the name of the man
who was shot?

179
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,065
They never say.

180
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,165
And let me guess.

181
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,932
You never asked.

182
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:42,132
Discretion is what this place
is built on, Detective.

183
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,732
Gentlemen come here
for good reason.

184
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,632
There is never
a good reason

185
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,499
to be unfaithful to your wife,
madam.

186
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,932
Let's talk again
when you're married, son.

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,465
I'm in a vicious circle.

188
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,899
No clients means no money.

189
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,765
No money means
no hiring of new staff.

190
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:05,632
I'm just hoping that when
this article is published,

191
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:09,965
it will attract new business.

192
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,332
Ivy, are you even
listening to me?

193
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,632
Sorry.

194
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,599
I've just got to a really
good bit in the story.

195
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,199
The detective has just found
another dead body.

196
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,665
Blood everywhere.

197
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,265
All you ever do these days
is have your nose in a book.

198
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,165
You're the one who told me
to read novels

199
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,732
like a normal person, instead of
your father's old law books.

200
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,599
Yes, but not all the time.

201
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,466
What about some
freshly baked biscuits?

202
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,199
Will that help?

203
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,233
Always.

204
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,332
And what about Moses?

205
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,365
He brings in a case or two--
when's he back?

206
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,265
Not any time soon.

207
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,599
Paris seems to suit him.

208
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,632
Well...

209
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,465
What about the inspector?

210
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,700
I can't ask him.
Why?

211
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,632
Things aren't quite the same
since Arabella.

212
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,399
But I thought that ended.

213
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,732
Well, yes, but we haven't
seen each other in a while.

214
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,265
Why not?

215
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,632
Because I've been busy.

216
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:05,766
No, you haven't.

217
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,900
Go and see him, Lizzie.

218
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:14,900
Ah! Back!

219
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,965
The rest are for Barnabus.

220
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,399
Excuse me.

221
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,999
Jim.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,766
Hey.
Watch out, sir.

223
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,032
Here we go--
thank you very much.

224
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,899
William, there you are.

225
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,132
I thought perhaps
you'd left for the evening.

226
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,532
You look tired.

227
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,232
You look beautiful.

228
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,600
Oh...

229
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,466
Thank you.

230
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:11,699
So, to what do I owe
this unexpected visit?

231
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,999
Well, I was just passing
and thought I'd pop in

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,999
to visit my oldest friend.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,099
Passing?

234
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,765
To where at this time
of night?
Dinner.

235
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,899
With whom?
Well, you wouldn't know them.

236
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,665
Because they don't exist?

237
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,032
What's that
supposed to mean?

238
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,699
I know you, Eliza.

239
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,032
You neither pass
nor pop,

240
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,265
you premeditate.

241
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,499
Now, I'm afraid,
is not a good time.

242
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,532
We are experiencing an
unprecedented level of cases.

243
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,865
I cannot go into why...

244
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,165
Well, because of the
further expansion

245
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,466
of Scotland Yard's
jurisdiction.

246
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,799
That's classified information
at the moment.

247
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,799
How do you know that?

248
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,932
I read it in the report

249
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,166
that's on your desk.

250
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,165
Well, it seems you could do
with more manpower.

251
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,099
So, how fortuitous
that I should drop by.

252
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,699
Since I'm now in charge
at Nash and Sons,

253
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,599
I have a large team of men
at my disposal.

254
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,265
Ah, there it is.

255
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,199
The real reason
that you're here.

256
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,832
You were the one who brought up
being understaffed.

257
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,032
All I'm saying...

258
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,665
Yes, Eliza, I know exactly
what you're saying.

259
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,699
I always know exactly what
you're saying,

260
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,665
even when
you're not saying it.

261
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,732
Good night.

262
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,732
Thank you.

263
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,865
I can confirm
he is the only patient

264
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:37,032
that was brought in today
with a gunshot wound to the leg.

265
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,399
I need the gentleman's name.

266
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,565
He refused to share it
when he was admitted.

267
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:43,732
And since then,
he's been administered laudanum

268
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,099
for the pain.

269
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,832
It'll be some time
before he's able to talk.

270
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,665
Thank you, Nurse.

271
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,132
Matron.

272
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:54,699
Oh, straighten that cap,
Sister!
Yes, Matron.

273
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
And see to the patient
in room five!

274
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,333
Reminds me of my missus.

275
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,465
Well...

276
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,165
There's not much more
we can do here tonight.

277
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,065
We'll come back
in the morning

278
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,999
when he's compos mentis,
find out who he is then.

279
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,665
I know exactly who he is.

280
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,465
I've seen him at meetings
with my father.

281
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:15,632
He's a government minister,
Charlie.

282
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:30,665
I have all the files here,
Inspector.

283
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,499
And once we've gone
through these,

284
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,232
I'll take you through
to the adjoining room

285
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,032
where there are even more
cadavers for your attention.

286
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,899
I can hardly wait.

287
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,265
I do not exaggerate when I say
we are bursting at the seams.

288
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:44,899
Our coroner, Mr. Wormsley's,
agitated indeed.

289
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,165
He is a precise man
who, who prides himself

290
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,765
on his meticulous
examinations.

291
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:53,465
Yet since this expansion,
he has felt--

292
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,099
and I hope I betray
no confidence here--

293
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,099
disgruntled,
to say the least.

294
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,499
Yes, well, I share Mr.
Wormsley's concern, Mr. Potts.

295
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,765
Mm.
Thank you.

296
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,599
Wellington.

297
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,599
Sir.

298
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,865
Commissioner Fitzroy.

299
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,332
May I say what a,
what a pleasure it is

300
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,765
to have you here in person.

301
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,000
Leave us.

302
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:23,333
I have a delicate matter
to discuss with you.

303
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,699
The brothel, in Mayfair.

304
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,432
The man who was shot
comes from the Home Office,

305
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:35,232
and he was not the only
gentleman of influence there.

306
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,932
Most of the possessions
that were stolen

307
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,399
have personal messages
and family crests

308
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,899
engraved on them,

309
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,332
so you can imagine
it would not be ideal

310
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:49,432
if it became public knowledge
where they were lost.

311
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:52,099
Yes, I can see that, sir.

312
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,565
Which is why we are going
to make it our absolute priority

313
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:58,265
to find out who did this and
to get those possessions back.

314
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:02,532
Yes.
And I want you to lead
the case yourself.

315
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:07,032
Well, sir, you, uh,
told me to specifically oversee

316
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,165
all active investigations.

317
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,499
Oh, forget what I told you.

318
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,065
Many of these men
have a say in my budgets.

319
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,099
They could make my life...

320
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,765
...difficult.

321
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,399
So, you will lead this case

322
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,632
and you will resolve it
with speed and discretion.

323
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:25,465
And, if you do not,
I will hold you

324
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,632
directly responsible.

325
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,465
Is that understood,
Wellington?

326
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,432
Yes, sir.

327
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,965
I won't tell you again,
I want no part in this.

328
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:40,099
Any association with that place
would be catastrophic for me.

329
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,165
I'm not just
a government minister,

330
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,465
I'm a married man
with children.

331
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:47,032
Yes.

332
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,599
Nevertheless, sir,

333
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,765
there are some questions
that I have to ask.

334
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,699
So, the gunman
came into the bedroom,

335
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,532
demanded your possessions...

336
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,732
I need some pain relief!

337
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,465
And I will send
for the nurse

338
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:00,732
when you have answered
my questions.

339
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,366
Am I under arrest?

340
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,665
No.
Then here is my statement.

341
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,565
I received this gunshot
in a hunting accident.

342
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:10,965
This is what I have told
my wife

343
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:13,099
and this is what I
will tell anyone who asks.

344
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:19,565
I do hope that answers any
further questions, Inspector.

345
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:22,632
"Illustrated Police News."

346
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,165
"Illustrated Police News."

347
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,999
Fresh off the press!

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,865
"Illustrated Police..."
Excuse me.

349
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,900
There you go.
Thank you.

350
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,565
"Illustrated Police News."

351
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:36,699
Morning, Clarence.

352
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,599
I have decided
today is the day

353
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,632
our fortunes change.

354
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,499
Do not bother,
Miss Scarlet.

355
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,732
I've already checked
and there is no article.

356
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,799
But Mr. Godfrey
specifically said

357
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,399
it would be in today's edition.

358
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,832
Oh, well, journalists
will promise the moon and stars

359
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,865
until a bigger and better
story comes along.

360
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:56,599
If, as I had advised,

361
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,465
you had kept our
advertising account with them,

362
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,365
they would have prioritized us,

363
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,232
as they did when Mr. Nash
was here.

364
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,465
Instead, you saw fit
to cancel said account

365
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,165
and spend the money
elsewhere.

366
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,266
For instance, on actors.

367
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,599
I'm curious, Clarence.

368
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,465
If you're so dissatisfied
with how I run things,

369
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:20,065
why do you not leave
like the rest?

370
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,565
Because...

371
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:25,800
I am not a quitter,
Miss Scarlet.

372
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,399
And I believe you could be
a little more grateful for that.

373
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,165
I understand
that a police investigation

374
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,699
might not be good
for business.

375
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,132
Well, that's an
understatement.

376
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,732
None of my clients
will come within a mile

377
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,365
while there's
a police presence.

378
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,032
And I can't afford
to have this place

379
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,265
shut down
for much longer.

380
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:50,465
Then help me
with my inquiries.

381
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,565
Don't you want to catch
whoever did this?

382
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,099
Oh, he'll be caught,
all right.

383
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,699
It's not just the great
and the good that come here.

384
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,365
I have clients from
all walks of life.

385
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:01,599
They'll catch
that toe-rag for me,

386
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,699
and when they do,

387
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,299
he'll wish he'd never
been born.

388
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,465
I must insist
that you don't take the law

389
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,965
into your own hands, madam--
we will find whoever did this.

390
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:14,799
I'm privy to many
conversations, Inspector.

391
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,632
Judges, politicians.

392
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,832
And when they've had their fill
of whiskey and women,

393
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,165
they like a nice little chat,

394
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,132
and I'm a very good listener.

395
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:29,665
Word is they're not very happy
with the great Scotland Yard.

396
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,332
From what I gather,

397
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,199
it's a shambles over there.

398
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,165
So, forgive me if I don't
share your confidence.

399
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,399
Sir, I've gathered files on all
those with previous conviction

400
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,199
for armed robbery
for the past three years,

401
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,799
but there's over
2,000 of them.

402
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,965
Better get on with it, then.

403
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,532
But, sir,
it's just such a huge task

404
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,932
and we just don't
have the manpower...

405
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,565
Then tell your father
what a mess we're in,

406
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:02,732
because he sure as hell
won't listen to me!

407
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,832
That was, uh,
that was uncalled for.

408
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,199
I apologize.

409
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,499
Permission to speak, sir?

410
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,299
Oliver, you don't
have to ask permission.

411
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,965
It's just you haven't
been home for days.

412
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,365
You, you need to rest.

413
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,599
Sleep is a luxury
that I don't have at the moment.

414
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,199
Right now, we need to find
a way to go through those files

415
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,832
and compare them to the
description of the gunman.

416
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,865
Well, we're gonna need
more men.

417
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,665
William, how nice to see you.

418
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,865
I received your telegram.

419
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,299
Although I must admit
I was unsure

420
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,999
whether I'd have time
to fit you in.

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,932
As you can see, things are
extremely busy at present.

422
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,565
Sorry to disturb you,
Miss Scarlet,

423
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:58,899
but I need your sign-off on the
Whitlock investigation.

424
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,299
Mm.

425
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,265
Shall we?

426
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,199
So, this brothel
in Mayfair...

427
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,299
All I can tell you is that
it was an armed robbery

428
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,065
where one of the punters was
injured with a gunshot wound.

429
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,432
So, I assume the fact that
you're keeping his identity

430
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,299
confidential means
that he's a man of influence.

431
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,899
Eliza, please don't
assume anything.

432
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,899
It never ends well.

433
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,499
Well, it's an
awful lot of files

434
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,899
you wish my men to go through.

435
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,465
Not to mention how vague the
description of the gunman is.

436
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:34,832
Perhaps you might be willing
to negotiate a higher fee?

437
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,999
Do you want the job or not?

438
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,132
Yes.

439
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,999
I'll take the case.
Good.

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,032
Then I'll have the files
delivered this afternoon.

441
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,532
And no sniffing around,
Eliza, or digging.

442
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,299
I'm not a dog, William.

443
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,965
No, but you are
relentless.

444
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:51,165
Do only what I ask of you,
nothing more.

445
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,300
My word is my bond.

446
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,166
If only that were true.

447
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,599
Yes!

448
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,765
I should not be doing
this donkey work.

449
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:16,032
Lest we forget,
Miss Scarlet,

450
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,165
I am a fully
qualified accountant.

451
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,999
How could I forget, Clarence,
when you remind me so often?

452
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,532
And with just the two of us,

453
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,532
this task will take
days to complete.

454
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,665
You're right, perhaps we do
need to get some help.

455
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:32,099
We do not have the money
to pay for extra help.

456
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,400
Who said anything
about paying?

457
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,565
I couldn't believe it
when I got your note, Lizzie.

458
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:43,299
Me, helping with
a real investigation!

459
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,699
It's just like in my novel.

460
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,032
The detective asks
his uncle for assistance.

461
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:49,599
Yes, he's an ex-policeman,
but still.

462
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,899
Right.

463
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,100
This little lot is done--
I'll go and get some more.

464
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,232
Are we brought so low that
we have to turn to your maid

465
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,799
for assistance?

466
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,199
She's more efficient
than you.

467
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,165
For every one file
you've checked, she's done five.

468
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,099
Mr. Nash...

469
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,965
I don't care what he
did or didn't do.

470
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:09,832
I'm in charge now.

471
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,365
And if you're so enamored
with Mr. Nash,

472
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,566
why didn't you go to Paris
with him?

473
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,232
What?

474
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:24,599
Go easy, hey?

475
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,765
I don't need advice on
how to manage my employees.

476
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:30,066
Employee, singular.

477
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,799
When you were a girl...

478
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,566
Oh, please, God, no.

479
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,666
Fine, I'll talk to him.

480
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,499
In my determination
to keep this agency afloat,

481
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,232
I may come across
as a little terse sometimes.

482
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:05,000
I apologize.

483
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:09,332
All I was going to say
about Mr. Nash

484
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,899
is that he has an army
of paid informants,

485
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,132
including girls who work

486
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:15,900
at many different brothels
across London.

487
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,799
Where would I find information
on these informants?

488
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,599
Why wasn't I told
this was in here?

489
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,532
Well, Mr. Nash likes to
keep the identity

490
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,199
of his informants
confidential.

491
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,565
I'm the chief investigator!

492
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:36,666
You're the only
investigator.

493
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,265
Right, um...

494
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:43,832
Police informants.

495
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,532
Legal informants.

496
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,532
Government informants.

497
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:48,799
Here we are.

498
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,600
Ladies of the night.

499
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,132
I adore Mr. Nash.

500
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,332
Always so good to me.

501
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,399
A very fair man--
everyone loves him.

502
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,900
Perhaps we could talk about
something other than Mr. Nash.

503
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,399
So, you work at
the Temple of Elysium.

504
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,732
For my sins.

505
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:12,399
I've heard of it.

506
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,299
I always thought it very clever.

507
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,365
A brothel themed
as a mythological paradise.

508
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:18,932
Hm, well, according to
the copper that came by,

509
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:21,365
women weren't even
allowed in Elysium.

510
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,665
Well, he's right.

511
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,665
It was one of the three realms
of the underworld

512
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,765
in Greek mythology.

513
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:28,432
Tartarus,
the Asphodel Meadows,

514
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,599
and then there was Elysium,
an Eden for heroes

515
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,199
favored by the gods.

516
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,032
Well, I can tell you, darling,

517
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:39,032
the men that visit me
ain't no heroes.

518
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,699
So, this shooting.

519
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,332
The description
of the gunman--

520
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,465
average height,
fair hair, blue eyes--

521
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:50,932
it's a little generic.

522
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:53,065
It's a pack of lies, too.

523
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:57,499
He was tall, brown hair,
brown eyes.

524
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,365
Me and the other girls
were told to lie

525
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:00,799
to the coppers by her.

526
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,365
Her?

527
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,365
Madam Hera.

528
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:06,665
That's not her real name,
of course,

529
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,432
just like Athena ain't mine.

530
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,533
Why would she tell you to lie?

531
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,766
Word is, she called in a favor
to find the gunman herself.

532
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,165
You cross the madam
at your own peril.

533
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,332
Poor old Dimitrie
found that out.

534
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,532
Dimitrie?

535
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:26,832
The watchman that was on

536
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,665
when the robbery took place.

537
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,499
She sacked the poor sod.

538
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,532
Welcome to Solomon's.

539
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:45,532
How can I help?

540
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,665
Is Solomon here?

541
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,532
I'm afraid my uncle's gone back
to Jamaica to visit family.

542
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:52,165
Well, perhaps you could
help me.

543
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,832
I'm an acquaintance of his,
Miss Scarlet.

544
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,632
I'm looking for man,
a watchman.

545
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:58,999
He was dismissed
from a, a brothel in Mayfair.

546
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,265
I need to find his address--
I wish to speak with him.

547
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:04,299
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about.

548
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,465
This is a shop to
buy things in, Miss Scarlet.

549
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:07,965
And speaking of which,

550
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,299
we've just had a new delivery
this very morning.

551
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,265
The golden vamp butterfly
from the Himalayan mountains.

552
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,599
Very rare.

553
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,099
There are
no golden vamp butterflies

554
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,099
in the Northern Hemisphere.

555
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,965
Ah, my mistake, yeah.

556
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:24,932
This is the golden vamp
from Madagascar.

557
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,265
And nor are they
completely golden,

558
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,500
just the tips of their wings.

559
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:30,866
This is very pretty.

560
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,866
What if I bought one?

561
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:36,199
I'll wrap it up for you.

562
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,065
What if I bought two?

563
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,499
Then I'll wrap them both.

564
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,765
How about three?

565
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,100
A watchman, you say?

566
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:46,433
Let me get my pen.

567
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,133
Miss Scarlet.

568
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,899
Mr. Sinclaire.

569
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,232
How are you, Miss Scarlet?

570
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:01,232
Busy.

571
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:04,299
Always such
a busy, busy bee.

572
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,965
I suppose, since
you've taken over

573
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:08,899
at Nash and Sons,
not that he has any sons,

574
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,299
time is precious.

575
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,332
What do you want,
Mr. Sinclaire?

576
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,599
Why, just to tell you
how hurt I am.

577
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,765
When I learned that you'd gone
to my underling, Mr. Godfrey,

578
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:21,065
instead of directly to me,

579
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:24,799
the chief correspondent of
our esteemed publication,

580
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,932
it was like a dagger
to my heart.

581
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,265
You have a heart,
Mr. Sinclaire.

582
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:29,532
That is welcome news.

583
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,665
"Basil," I said to myself,

584
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:34,332
"You and Miss Scarlet are
old acquaintances, are you not?

585
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,865
Why on Earth would she
do such a thing?"

586
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:38,165
The last time
we worked together,

587
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,799
you printed a pack of lies--
does that help?

588
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,565
Ooh, lies, you say?

589
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:46,199
Like the ones you fed
young Mr. Godfrey?

590
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,265
It seems that in your eagerness
to laud your success,

591
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:54,932
it has led you down the
slippery slope of dishonesty.

592
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,932
Oh, dear, dear me.

593
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:59,399
You see, I happen
to know for a fact

594
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,665
that Mr. Nash's entire staff
have deserted you,

595
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,232
and so, too,
his book of clients.

596
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:08,832
And so, in my capacity
as chief correspondent,

597
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:12,999
I have decided that I will be
the one to write the article,

598
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,632
and it shall be one
based on the truth:

599
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,332
that the once
most successful

600
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,899
private investigation
agency in London

601
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,733
is now on the verge of collapse.

602
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,865
And it is all thanks

603
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:30,332
to the lady detective.

604
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,299
Ah.

605
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,199
Whoa.

606
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,800
Good day, Miss Scarlet.

607
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,032
Ride on!

608
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:44,699
Sir-- hup!

609
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,700
Let him go.
Sir.

610
00:28:58,666 --> 00:28:59,999
Any luck?

611
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,399
He's got an alibi,
just like all the others.

612
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,099
So, we round up some more?

613
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,766
We'll make a detective
of you yet, Charlie.

614
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:08,132
William.

615
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,300
Inspector Wellington.

616
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,432
Inspector Wellington,
Detective Phelps.

617
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,099
Miss Scarlet.

618
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,732
Get the wagons ready.

619
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:18,732
I'll meet you
out front.

620
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,332
I have something I need
to tell you, William,

621
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:25,032
but will you promise
to remain calm?

622
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:29,465
You hired actors to pose
as your staff of detectives?

623
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,332
I knew you'd react
like this.

624
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,665
You fooled me into hiring you!
How would you like me to react?

625
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:36,632
Well, at least I did the decent
thing to tell you myself,

626
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,999
rather than you reading it
in Sinclaire's rag.

627
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,399
The decent thing was not
to lie to me in the first place.

628
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,132
There's nothing you can say
that I haven't already said

629
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,266
to myself.
Oh, I'm quite sure
that there is.

630
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:47,765
It's all very well

631
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:48,965
for you in your
comfortable job.

632
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:50,732
I haven't slept for weeks
worrying about mine.

633
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,465
My God, Eliza, there is nothing
comfortable about my job,

634
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,165
and if you had
any shred of concern

635
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,599
for anyone
other than yourself,

636
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,965
then you would know this!

637
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,865
Good day, Miss Scarlet.

638
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:08,232
Is, is all well?

639
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:10,199
Not remotely.

640
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,900
But never mind that.

641
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:15,599
You're on the
brothel robbery?

642
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,032
I am.

643
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:18,565
Good.

644
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,600
Because I have some information
I'd like to share with you.

645
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,965
So, the madam lied about
the description of the gunman.

646
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:30,699
Apparently so.

647
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,932
I've also put the feelers out
to find this dismissed watchman.

648
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:38,566
Thank you,
this is most helpful.

649
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,832
Oliver.

650
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,165
Inspector Wellington,

651
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:49,265
how have you found him
recently?

652
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:52,499
I cannot lie, um,
I'm concerned about him.

653
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,365
He hasn't been home
for days.

654
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,099
He's putting all his attention
on this robbery,

655
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,132
to the detriment
of other cases,

656
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:01,499
of which there are many.

657
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,699
Well, then, let me help you.

658
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,865
Share your findings with me.

659
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,965
Uh, this is a highly
confidential investigation.

660
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:10,432
I'm afraid I cannot.

661
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:16,232
However,

662
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,765
if I were to leave
the file here,

663
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:21,299
and if I were to just
pop out for a moment,

664
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,132
then if someone were to read
the file without my knowledge,

665
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,365
well...

666
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,033
The man who was shot.

667
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,165
Any identity yet?

668
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:38,165
Page four.

669
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:25,466
What are you doing?

670
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,699
Why are you not
in your uniform?

671
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,665
I don't understand.

672
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,632
You are Nurse James,
due to start today?

673
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:36,832
Well, this room
is a disgrace!

674
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:40,365
These soiled clothes should
have been disposed of yesterday!

675
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:42,299
And when you have done that,
his bed needs remaking,

676
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,832
his temperature recorded,
and bandage changed.

677
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,532
So get these clothes
down to the basement

678
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,932
ready to be
incinerated,

679
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:51,532
get into your uniform,
and report back immediately!

680
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,465
Is that clear?
If you would
just let me speak.

681
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,732
I'm not a nurse.

682
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,032
My name is Eliza Scarlet.

683
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:57,799
I'm a private detective--
and, please,

684
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,266
don't say,
"You're a what?"

685
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:12,099
Come on, come on!

686
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,165
Come on, we haven't got all day.

687
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,165
Go, go, go!

688
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:19,865
Get this lot inside, Charlie.

689
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:21,665
All right, you ugly lot,
hurry up!

690
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,232
Or you'll feel my boot
where the sun don't shine!

691
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,665
There you are, sir.

692
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,932
I have new information
on the Elysium case.

693
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:30,932
Go on.

694
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,899
The madam of
the brothel lied.

695
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,199
The gunman wasn't fair,
blue eyes, or medium height.

696
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,532
He was the opposite: tall,
brown hair, brown eyes.

697
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,432
According to whom?

698
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:40,465
Miss Scarlet.

699
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:43,232
She seemed quite certain
of it, too.

700
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:46,533
I think I'll pay Madam Hera
a little visit.

701
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,532
Where's Ivy?

702
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,365
Gone to make dinner
for someone called Barnabus.

703
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,265
She did take a box of files
with her

704
00:33:57,266 --> 00:34:00,665
to work through--
oh, this came for you.

705
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,399
It's a court summons
for rent arrears.

706
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,532
I really could do with
some good news, Clarence.

707
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:10,766
Well, the watchman
you've been looking for...

708
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,632
He's in your office.

709
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:22,300
So, the madam dismissed you
after the robbery.

710
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,132
Because I ran outside for help
instead of tackling the gunman.

711
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:33,632
I came here 20 years ago
in search for better life.

712
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:36,599
But, as a watchman,
I have spent those years

713
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,300
getting beaten up
and shot at.

714
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:42,132
And when I was young,
I did not mind, but...

715
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:44,132
I'm getting old.

716
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:47,099
I have children
I want to see grow up.

717
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,299
And because of that woman,

718
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,232
I will not be able
to put some food

719
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:51,732
on my family's table
tonight.

720
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,532
I have no loyalty to her,

721
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:56,732
so I will tell you
something.

722
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:58,200
I'm listening.

723
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:03,132
She told me to lie
to the police.

724
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:07,532
When I was calling for help, I
saw no gunman leave the brothel.

725
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:11,899
But if you didn't see the gunman
leave, then how did he get away?

726
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,033
A back entrance?

727
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:18,765
There is no back entrance.

728
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,599
I was forbidden
to ever go upstairs,

729
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,965
but I've heard

730
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,899
there is a secret way
in and out.

731
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,065
The building
that adjoins the brothel

732
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:42,765
was once
an exclusive gentlemen's club.

733
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,732
It shut down years ago,

734
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:48,265
but it was once frequented
by the rich and powerful,

735
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:52,400
by politicians and even princes.

736
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,599
Legend has it that the clients
would use a connecting door

737
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,899
into the brothel
as a discreet way in.

738
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,699
If the door exists,

739
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,033
I believe that's how
the gunman escaped.

740
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,499
Three sons of Titan.

741
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,033
Zeus, god of the sky.

742
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,932
Poseidon, god of the sea.

743
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,132
And Hades, god of the three
realms of the underworld:

744
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,865
Tartarus, the Asphodel Meadows,

745
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:34,999
and Elysium.

746
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,733
A bullet hole.

747
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,532
Well, that's news to me.

748
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,732
What do you mean
they've been returned?

749
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:40,499
Exactly that.

750
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,065
Everything stolen
is in this box.

751
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,332
It was outside the entrance
this morning.

752
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,833
I've got no idea who left it.

753
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,999
So, I will return these

754
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,732
to their rightful owners,
and case is closed.

755
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:56,233
The case is closed
when I say it is.

756
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,532
I'll be taking the contents
of that box

757
00:37:58,533 --> 00:37:59,899
back to Scotland Yard,

758
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,332
where it will be logged
as evidence.

759
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,499
As for you,

760
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,165
you'll come with me
and make a statement

761
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,732
explaining how you came
to be in possession

762
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:08,000
of these stolen goods.

763
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,399
I'm quite sure, Inspector,
that your superiors

764
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,199
have instructed you
to close this case

765
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,399
with speed and discretion.

766
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,599
Taking these valuables
to Scotland Yard,

767
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,099
and, indeed, me,

768
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,532
I would argue that is the

769
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,299
very opposite of discretion.

770
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,732
So, we're agreed.

771
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:38,499
I will return these
to my clients,

772
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,699
and you will leave
my premises

773
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,365
and bother me no more.

774
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,165
See, you're forgetting
something, madam.

775
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:51,232
There is a man lying in hospital
who was shot on these premises.

776
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:54,132
Last I heard, the poor minister,

777
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:58,332
he was adamant that he was
wounded in a hunting accident.

778
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:01,466
No more days out shooting
for him.

779
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:08,233
Not if his wife
has anything to do with it.

780
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,732
I do not have the appetite
nor the inclination

781
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:01,865
for another argument, Eliza.

782
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,932
My day has been vexing enough.

783
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:05,132
I do not come
to argue.

784
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:06,199
I come to tell you
I've made

785
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,299
a discovery
on the brothel case.

786
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,399
No, Eliza...

787
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,465
I know who the gunman is.

788
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,999
There's a hidden door

789
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,965
that leads from the bedroom
where the minister was shot

790
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:19,232
into a room
of an abandoned building,

791
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:21,199
and it's there
that I found a bullet.

792
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,033
I believe it was discharged
by the gunman as he escaped.

793
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:31,199
Trousers belonging
to the minister.

794
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,265
They were due to be
incinerated at the hospital.

795
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:34,966
So, what does this
have to do with the bullet?

796
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,732
This was attached
to the bullet.

797
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,299
I recognized the pattern
on the cloth.

798
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,866
I knew I'd seen it before
at hospital.

799
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,365
So, why, why
would the minister lie

800
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:06,632
and say that the gunman
shot him in the bedroom?

801
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,766
Because he is the gunman,
William.

802
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,665
Why on Earth would I want
to stage a robbery?

803
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,299
I'm a government minister,
for heaven's sake!

804
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,065
Well, I've done some
digging on you, sir,

805
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:25,832
and it would appear that you're
also in grave financial straits.

806
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,165
I would say
that that is motive enough.

807
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,699
Being a junior minister
must be a costly business

808
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,132
if you hope
for a promotion.

809
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:37,132
Dinners, theater trips, hosting
parties with the right wine.

810
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:39,966
It must be a strain
on one's resources.

811
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,465
Anyone who tells you,
"It's not who you know,

812
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:48,666
but what you know," is a liar.

813
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:56,065
I needed the money
to rise up the ranks,

814
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:59,132
to impress those with the power
to help me advance.

815
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:01,465
So, you staged a robbery
in a place where no one

816
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:05,065
would want to admit to being.

817
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:08,066
It is the favored brothel
by those at the Home Office.

818
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:11,932
It seemed like the perfect place
to do it.

819
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:15,765
So, while everyone thought
you were in bed intoxicated,

820
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,700
you disguised yourself
as the gunman.

821
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,932
And when it came
to robbing yourself,

822
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:22,332
you staged a fight
to make it look like

823
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,432
there'd been a struggle.

824
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,999
I planned to leave
the gunman's attire

825
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,599
and what I'd stolen
in the room next door.

826
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,865
I would then get back into bed
as the drunk minister,

827
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:36,732
and no one would be
any the wiser.

828
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:40,565
But then I heard the watchman on
duty yelling for help outside,

829
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:43,432
and I...

830
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:44,899
I flew into a panic.

831
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,499
As I squeezed through the door
to the disused room,

832
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,732
I stumbled and fell.

833
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:56,632
And the handgun went off.

834
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:59,799
I've never used a handgun
before.

835
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,533
Bought it from some rough type
in a pub in Whitechapel.

836
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:07,899
But you had to cover the fact
you'd been shot,

837
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,733
so you put a bullet
in the bedroom floor, too.

838
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:16,932
I told the madam everything.

839
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:19,399
I had to.

840
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,799
I needed her help.

841
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,932
She was livid I'd done such a
thing in her place of business,

842
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:28,465
so she instructed
that I keep my mouth shut.

843
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:30,432
And she would get rid
of the evidence.

844
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,265
Which is why she
pretended to track down

845
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:34,565
the stolen possessions,

846
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:36,665
when, in fact, she had them
all the time.

847
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:39,765
They would be returned
to their owners,

848
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:44,200
and the case would be closed
quickly and discreetly.

849
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:53,899
Minister Delaware will resign

850
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,266
and go away quietly.

851
00:43:57,533 --> 00:44:00,432
And this Madam Hera,

852
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:02,699
she's up to her eyes
in all this, too.
Oh, no, no.

853
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,065
She's to be left alone.

854
00:44:04,066 --> 00:44:06,833
She knows too much
about too many.

855
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:10,565
Sir, um,

856
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,965
this expansion is crippling us.

857
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:16,799
We lack the manpower
and the resources to cope.

858
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,165
My biggest fear is
that I am sending my men

859
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:22,332
into situations
that they are ill prepared for.

860
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:23,732
Someone is going to get hurt.

861
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,865
What would you have me do?

862
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:27,699
I cannot pluck money
out of thin air.

863
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,032
No, sir, but, um...

864
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,565
But perhaps this,
this case can,

865
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:37,065
can give you some more sway
with the Home Office.

866
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:40,265
After all, it's for their sake
that we're staying quiet.

867
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,432
You are asking me
to blackmail them,

868
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:46,999
a government department.

869
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,133
No, of course not, sir,
not blackmail, more, um...

870
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:55,599
More leverage to negotiate.

871
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,999
If I had my way, I would dismiss
you with immediate effect

872
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,532
for the mere suggestion
of such a thing.

873
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:10,666
But given the flux we are in,
that would benefit no one.

874
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:16,666
You are to keep your mouth shut
about this case.

875
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:19,965
Is that clear,
Wellington?

876
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:22,099
Perfectly, sir.

877
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,032
You were simply
thinking of your men.

878
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,232
The police commissioner didn't
quite see it like that.

879
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:39,732
Would you like me
to have a word with him?

880
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,799
It's nice to see you
smile.

881
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,600
Well, I haven't had much
to smile about recently.

882
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:54,432
I'm sorry I lied to you.

883
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:00,399
I did try to lead Nash's men.

884
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,165
But they just saw me
as some bossy woman.

885
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:05,565
You're not bossy, Eliza.

886
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:11,100
You are determined.

887
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,233
Things haven't quite
turned out how I'd hoped.

888
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:25,000
Sometimes I do wonder...

889
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:30,266
If it's all worth it?

890
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:37,465
You are a good detective,
Eliza, very good.

891
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:39,065
And whatever happens from here,

892
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:42,132
you'll find a way
to make it work.

893
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,899
You always do.

894
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,199
Are you just saying that
so that I pay

895
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,432
for dinner tomorrow evening?

896
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:51,099
I wasn't aware
that we were due to dine.

897
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,665
Well, the last Wednesday
of every month, we dine,

898
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:57,032
and that just happens
to be tomorrow.

899
00:46:57,033 --> 00:46:59,799
It's been a while
since we enjoyed an evening out.

900
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,666
It has.

901
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,699
Well, no more burning
the midnight oil.

902
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,899
You must go home tonight

903
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,665
and rest-- I will not
have you falling asleep

904
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,999
at the table.
I take back what I said.

905
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,399
You are bossy.

906
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,433
Good night, Eliza.

907
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:25,265
Good night, William.

908
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:27,532
Night, Inspector.

909
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:28,565
Night, Ivy.

910
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,399
I've found something
in these files

911
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,399
you asked me
to look through.

912
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,499
The case is closed, Ivy.

913
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,832
It's not about the gunman.

914
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,432
It's about someone else
entirely.

915
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:46,065
Now I understand why you
haven't sought another position

916
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:47,099
like the others.

917
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,365
Or gone to Paris
with Mr. Nash.

918
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:52,299
The small issue
of a criminal record

919
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,565
would have put paid
to that!

920
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:57,065
You are mentioned
as an associate to not one,

921
00:47:57,066 --> 00:47:59,865
but three criminal gangs
as their accountant.

922
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:02,365
And not a very successful one,
given you've served time

923
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:03,933
for taxation fraud.

924
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:12,532
Mr. Nash hired me
when no one else would.

925
00:48:12,533 --> 00:48:14,266
And I shall be forever grateful
for that.

926
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,633
I shall fetch my coat and hat.

927
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:29,200
No, don't.

928
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:36,900
Neither of us is perfect,
Clarence.

929
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,399
And if I promise to be
more accommodating,

930
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,465
I would like you to promise to
stop comparing me to Mr. Nash.

931
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:57,133
So, we are stuck
with each other.

932
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,199
It seems so.

933
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,665
Together, Clarence,
we shall once more

934
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,199
make this agency
successful.

935
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,232
And those that underestimate us
should do so at their own peril.

936
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:20,232
Oh, um, on that, our informant
from the brothel, Athena,

937
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:21,932
came by for her fee.

938
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:24,765
She likes to chat, that one.

939
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:29,799
She told me something
that may be of interest to you.

940
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:41,499
Mr. Sinclaire.

941
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,432
Ah, Miss Scarlet.

942
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,832
How serendipitous.

943
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:48,132
I was intending to pay you
a visit this very afternoon.

944
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:49,866
It appears you have
saved me a journey.

945
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,232
Here is the story I have

946
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:55,532
just penned
about you and your...

947
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:58,199
...lamentable fall from grace.

948
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,632
Would you care
to read it now?

949
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,999
Or perhaps you would rather
wait until it's published,

950
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,565
which I believe it will be,

951
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,532
in tomorrow morning's edition.

952
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:07,165
No, it will not,
Mr. Sinclaire.

953
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:09,399
In fact, you will return
immediately to the office

954
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,632
and retract the article.

955
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:13,132
And why on Earth
would I do that?

956
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:15,132
You've no doubt heard about
the robbery that took place

957
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:17,899
at the brothel in Mayfair,
the Temple of Elysium.

958
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,465
The madam has
asked her girls

959
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,099
to reunite
their regular clients

960
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,732
with their stolen
possessions.

961
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:25,932
And one of those girls
just happens to be

962
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:27,532
an associate of mine.

963
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:28,633
Athena?

964
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,200
She kindly allowed me
to return this to you.

965
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,532
Very nice inscription
of your name.

966
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:42,133
No mention of you being
chief correspondent, though.

967
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,399
Perhaps the next time
your wife

968
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,032
inscribes a gift, she'll
remember to include it.

969
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,499
Oh, and just to reassure you,

970
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,632
Inspector Wellington has
logged it as evidence.

971
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:52,899
So, should the need
ever arise to prove

972
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,966
your presence at the brothel,
it will not be hard to do so.

973
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,466
Good day, Mr. Sinclaire.

974
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,865
Thank you.

975
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,399
Miss Scarlet.

976
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,865
If you will excuse me,

977
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:35,099
I'm taking tea
with my good friend.

978
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,165
Theobald!

979
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,632
You wish to hire me?

980
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,599
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

981
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,332
I'm sure I'll be fine
to visit such a dangerous,

982
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,332
violent criminal.

983
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,566
Alone.
