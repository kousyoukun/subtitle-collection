1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,065
I'm running this London office
now,

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,365
and I can assure you
things will pick up.

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,365
We have exactly no clients.

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,999
We are experiencing
an unprecedented level of cases.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,532
William, there you are.

6
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:15,932
You look tired.

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,532
You look beautiful.

8
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,599
My biggest fear is
that I am sending my men

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,032
into situations
that they are ill-prepared for.

10
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,665
Someone is going to get hurt.

11
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:06,132
Mr. Potts! Mr. Potts!

12
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,199
Miss Scarlet--
good afternoon.

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,865
Oh, Mr. Potts,
tomorrow, I embark on a case

14
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,799
with Inspector Wellington,
and I require

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,932
some background information
on one of your cadavers.

16
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:18,199
There is such a thing as
a protocol, Miss Scarlet,

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,132
and as such,
I will convey any information

18
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,099
directly to the inspector.
I do understand,

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,865
but hopefully my involvement
will hasten

20
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,599
the arrest
of the perpetrator.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,032
The sooner
I have this information,

22
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,499
the sooner
he will be behind bars.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,699
Surely, that is more
important than protocol.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,465
Nothing is more important
than protocol, Miss Scarlet.

25
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:36,165
Now, I'm late for
an appointment.

26
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,466
Good day.

27
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,699
Mr. Potts!

28
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,332
God save us.

29
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,332
We are practically
family now, Mr. Potts.

30
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,565
My relationship with Ivy will

31
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:54,965
and always shall
be a private matter.

32
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,399
It should never be
used as a bargaining tool.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,265
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm taking tea

34
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:03,332
with my good friend
Mr. Theobald Turner.

35
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,432
We take tea
on alternate Wednesdays,

36
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,932
and as I've already said,
I am late!

37
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:08,932
Theobald?

38
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,232
Theobald!

39
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,332
Theobald!

40
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,933
Out of the way, Mr. Potts.

41
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,799
So you saw
no one leaving the scene?

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,699
Well, as I said,
the back door was open.

43
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,365
The perpetrator must
have escaped from there.

44
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,799
I was talking to Mr. Potts.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,132
Uh,

46
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,132
we saw no one.

47
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,165
Oh, good.

48
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,165
You've decided to join us again,

49
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,399
Detective Black.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,532
Feeling better?

51
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:17,899
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,399
You'd better get used
to the sight of blood, son.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,499
This is your life
for the next 25 years.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,599
First crime scene-- bless him.

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,499
I believe Mr. Turner was
dead before he hit the ground.

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,065
Hm, a private detective

57
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,532
and now an amateur doctor.

58
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,232
How efficient you are,
Miss Scarlet.

59
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,099
You wish to talk of efficiency,
Detective Phelps,

60
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,565
when it took over an hour for
the first constable to arrive.

61
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:42,499
Now, if I may, I have
some further observations.

62
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,899
Do mind the blood.

63
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:53,899
I believe the victim was hit
here,

64
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,333
knocked to the floor
with some force.

65
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,299
Poor Theobald clearly struggled
to the front of the shop

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,532
to get help.

67
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,165
The cause of death was
likely a blow to the head.

68
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,999
Have you finished?

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,532
No-- the back door shows
signs of forced entry,

70
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,465
the cash box has been emptied,

71
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:13,032
and there are some brass handles
missing from the coffins,

72
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,499
which all points to a robbery,
but...

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,065
It's strange that an undertaker

74
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,465
would be the target
of such a crime,

75
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,832
particularly one of his caliber.

76
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,799
Theobald was
an excellent undertaker!

77
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,265
Well, thank for
your observations, Miss Scarlet.

78
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,665
But I'm sure we would have come
to that conclusion ourselves.

79
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,832
Wouldn't you agree,
Detective Black?

80
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,465
What's that smell?

81
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:34,732
Uh, formaldehyde from
the mortuary downstairs.

82
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,999
Shut that window immediately.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,165
You're disturbing
important evidence.

84
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,933
What is wrong with you, man?

85
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:48,099
This is a crime scene!

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,865
Yes, sir-- sorry, sir.

87
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,165
As a child, the notion
that the dead needed a bell

88
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,632
in case they woke up in
their coffin quite terrified me.

89
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,265
Well, I'd love to stay
and reminisce

90
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,165
about your childhood,
Miss Scarlet,

91
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,533
but we will come to our own
observations and deductions.

92
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,732
I feel sick again, sir.

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Thank you.

94
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,265
Good morning,
Miss Scarlet.

95
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:30,399
Secret admirer?

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,732
Good morning, Clarence, and no,
just a little gift to myself.

97
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,999
Some cheer for my office.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,965
Need I remind you,
every shilling counts?

99
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,765
The shillings will
soon be pouring in, Clarence.

100
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:45,165
Inspector Wellington
has promised me a case.

101
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,199
And I'm quite sure
by this time next week,

102
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,432
we shall have plenty more.

103
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,399
Besides, in this line
of work, it's important

104
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,665
to remind oneself there
is some beauty in the world.

105
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,932
Morning.
Inspector Wellington.

106
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,732
I was just talking about you.
I'd really rather
you didn't.

107
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,832
All good things,
I can assure you.

108
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,799
Well, in that case,
don't let me stop you.

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,499
- How are you, William?
- Fine, thank you.

110
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,233
You just sniffed.

111
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,899
So, either you're
allergic to these flowers

112
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,133
or you have bad news.

113
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,699
We've, uh,
we've had a diktat from above.

114
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,165
Budgets are
being further squeezed.

115
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,299
Fewer men on more cases.

116
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,632
Recruits are being rushed
through without proper training.

117
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:35,699
And, uh, and no more
hiring of private investigators.

118
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,799
Well, what about the case?
The one you promised me.

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,132
You're, you're aware
how much I need it.
Yes, believe me

120
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,065
that this is the last thing
that I want.

121
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,132
You have no idea
of my present workload.

122
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,932
Well, if you're so busy,
that's even more reason

123
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,165
to hire me, William.

124
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,399
I'm sorry,
but it's out of my hands.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,465
But if anything changes,

126
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,600
then you will be
the first to know, I promise.

127
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,432
Look, I should get back, I have
a great deal of work to do.

128
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,566
Good for you.

129
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,899
How long do you intend
to be cross with me for?

130
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,299
A rough estimate will do.

131
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not cross with you,
it's just the situation.

132
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Really, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,999
Oh, good morning, Miss Scarlet.
Any cases today?

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,066
No, but tomorrow,
I'm certain.

135
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,733
Anything today?

136
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,465
Morning-- anything?

137
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,866
Uh, no, nothing as yet.

138
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:52,165
I do wish you would calm down,
Barnabus-- all this stress

139
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,265
and strain will play havoc
on your blood pressure.

140
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,799
It's been a week,
and nothing!

141
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,532
My friend still lies in
cold store, awaiting burial.

142
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,265
They do seem rather busy.

143
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,266
Ah, Inspector!

144
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,232
Inspector Wellington.

145
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,065
Mr. Potts, Ivy.

146
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:12,899
Inspector Wellington,
we've been waiting some time now

147
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,832
to speak to Detective Phelps
about my friend's death.

148
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,665
Mr. Theobald Turner?

149
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,365
Detective Phelps has
been sent up north

150
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:20,299
on police business,
and as far as I'm aware,

151
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,432
Detective Black is now
leading the investigation.

152
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:26,099
Will you please
deal with this man?

153
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,899
Thank you!

154
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,433
May I be candid, Inspector?

155
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,699
Detective Black is not
equipped to lead this case.

156
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,232
He's not equipped to lead
any case.

157
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,032
I'm sure that Detective Black
will be available shortly.

158
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,565
Now, if you'll excuse me...

159
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:43,732
- No, I...
-  Look at the flush on those cheeks of yours.

160
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,799
I won't be a widow
before I'm married, Barnabus.

161
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,465
I'll find someone else
to help you.

162
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,933
And I know just the person.

163
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,366
You wish to hire me?

164
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,565
Well, the Metropolitan Police

165
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,532
really should be doing
their job.

166
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:10,032
But as I always say, the world
is going to hell in a handcart.

167
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:12,100
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,599
Thank you for that,

169
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,965
Mr. Potts.
Mm.

170
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,199
I can assure you,

171
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,499
I will do my utmost
to solve this case.

172
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,765
Well, as your new client,

173
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,899
I must insist on daily briefings
for any developments.

174
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,532
I look forward to it.

175
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:32,265
So, do you know of anyone

176
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,999
who might have had a grudge
against Mr. Turner?

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,232
Someone he worked with,
perhaps?

178
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,099
But what if it was
just a robbery?

179
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,799
Missing cashbox,
stolen brass handles...

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,999
That is still a possibility,
but as I told Detective Phelps,

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,432
a funeral parlor
is an odd place to rob,

182
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,765
particularly one
that was clearly on hard times.

183
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,665
As I said before, Theobald
was an excellent undertaker.

184
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,232
Miss Scarlet is not doubting
that for a moment, Barnabus.

185
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:57,132
She just needs to consider
all possibilities.

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,732
Well, in answer
to your question,

187
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:05,699
I can think of no one
who'd wish to harm Theobald.

188
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,432
As for work colleagues, well,

189
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,965
he was increasingly
working alone.

190
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,832
He hired in help
only when he needed it.

191
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,465
Oh, you did
mention his sister.

192
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,965
Oh, yes.

193
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,732
Yes, thank, thank you, Ivy.

194
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,699
Um, a Miss Francesca Turner.

195
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,932
She resides in Bristol.

196
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,099
I presume she'll be
at the funeral, but who knows?

197
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,365
Well, why wouldn't she be?

198
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:32,132
They've been estranged
for many years.

199
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,699
Which is why, as executor
to Theobald's will,

200
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,699
I was surprised to learn that

201
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,932
he's left his entire business
to her.

202
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,032
The Lord is my light

203
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,865
and my salvation.

204
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:49,399
Whom shall I fear?

205
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,432
The Lord is
the stronghold of my life.

206
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:57,732
Of whom shall I be afraid?

207
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:00,999
When the wicked advance
against me to devour me,

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,732
it is my enemies
and my foes...

209
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,365
I don't see any sign
of the woman

210
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:08,099
who could be
Mr. Turner's sister.

211
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,732
Over there, by the tree.

212
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:25,199
Excuse me,
you're Mr. Turner's sister?

213
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,232
I am-- Miss Francesca Turner.

214
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,499
Miss Eliza Scarlet.

215
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,599
I'm so sorry for your loss.

216
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,199
Mr. Potts mentioned you.

217
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,265
A female private detective.

218
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:40,032
It seems almost as unlikely
as a female undertaker,

219
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,399
which I now seem to be.

220
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,265
Yes, I heard your brother left
you the business in his will.

221
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,799
Was that something
you were expecting?

222
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,332
I suspect you already
know the answer to that.

223
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,032
I did hear the two of you
were estranged.

224
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:59,332
You do not waste time,
do you, Miss Scarlet?

225
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,799
I apologize, but it is my job
to ask questions,

226
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,565
and, well, my swiftness
is for good reason.

227
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:09,133
To find out what happened
to your brother.

228
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,065
I have not seen Theobald
in over 20 years.

229
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,265
There is some regret there
for both of us,

230
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:21,066
it seems, given
that he left me the business.

231
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,199
You live in Bristol, I believe--
will you now move to London?

232
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,865
I've no inclination
to become an undertaker.

233
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,699
I had quite enough
of that in my childhood

234
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,099
when my father
ran the business.

235
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,832
I will stay for as long
as it takes to sell.

236
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,265
But it may take some time.

237
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:41,499
There are clauses in the will
which I must take into account.

238
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,966
Such as?

239
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:49,832
Theobald did not want me to sell
to a particular funeral home.

240
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,665
Hardcastle's.

241
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,299
Which is a shame, because,
according to my solicitor,

242
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,866
they're the only ones
to have made an offer.

243
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,465
Why do you think your brother
would make such a request?

244
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,665
Theobald and John Hardcastle
had always been

245
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,632
old business rivals,
as our fathers were before them.

246
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,332
I can only imagine things
had somehow

247
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,832
festered further between them.

248
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,499
Miss Scarlet.

249
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,965
I've managed to garner
some information

250
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,732
on Hardcastle's Funeral
Directors.

251
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,565
Are you quite well, Clarence?

252
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:35,932
Yes, yes, uh...

253
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,365
I, I persuaded the clerk
of the Funeral Directors' Guild

254
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:39,732
to have a drink with me.

255
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:43,865
I am, as a rule,
teetotal, but, um,

256
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,265
I thought I should do
what I could

257
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,632
for the sake of the company.

258
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,899
How very resourceful of you.

259
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,999
And what did
you find out from this drink?

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,499
Well, Hardcastle's have
expanded extremely quickly

261
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,032
over recent years,

262
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,932
buying up smaller funeral homes
across the city.

263
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:00,265
But rumors of malpractice

264
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,065
have followed them round
like a bad smell.

265
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:10,099
The clerk told me that there
had been numerous complaints

266
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,099
against the firm to the guild.

267
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,065
The latest was, um,
from an Albert Edmunds.

268
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:18,699
He's a former employee
of Hardcastle's.

269
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,465
I have his address.

270
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,232
Perhaps I need
a little lie-down.

271
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,432
Oh, I never met Mr. Turner,

272
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,365
but I heard mention of him
a number of times.

273
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,432
I know Mr. Hardcastle
was determined

274
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,633
to take over the business,
but Mr. Turner wouldn't sell.

275
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,465
So, you filed a complaint
against your former employer?

276
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:46,332
I, I was an apprentice
for Mr. Hardcastle.

277
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,899
I saw it all.

278
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,965
Him making people pay for
funerals they couldn't afford,

279
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,999
introducing them
to moneylenders,

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,732
and when they couldn't
afford the payments,

281
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:57,265
thugs were sent round to make
them pay-- intimidation,

282
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,832
smashing windows.

283
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,632
And the Funeral Directors'
Guild, what did they say?

284
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:01,865
Didn't want to know.

285
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:04,132
Mr. Hardcastle has them
in his pocket.

286
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,532
Is that why you left
the company?

287
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:08,365
Well, I was dismissed
for no good reason.

288
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,899
I was just told by one of
Mr. Hardcastle's assistants

289
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,832
that I was no longer needed.

290
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,765
If I was looking for someone

291
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,132
who had cause
to kill Mr. Turner,

292
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:22,199
Mr. Hardcastle would be
the top of my list.

293
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,032
Thank you for allowing me
this access.

294
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,332
It's, it's most useful.

295
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,265
Theobald and I may not
have seen eye to eye,

296
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:35,365
but I still want

297
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:38,232
whoever harmed him
to face justice.

298
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,465
Why did you not
see eye to eye?

299
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,832
You know how
it is with family.

300
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,333
No one can vex you like
your own flesh and blood.

301
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,999
If my father could
see me now.

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,033
Owner of the family business.

303
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,032
And your father?

304
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:01,232
I cannot imagine he approves
of your line of work.

305
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,199
My father
was a police officer

306
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,799
and later
a private investigator.

307
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,599
He was an enlightened man, but
he didn't want this life for me.

308
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,066
He knew it would be
a difficult path.

309
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,765
In every household, there is
at least one resourceful woman.

310
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,999
If more of us were accepted,

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,299
Mr. Potts's lament that

312
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,299
the world is going
to hell in a handcart

313
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,766
might no longer be the case.

314
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,400
Miss Turner.

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,332
A glazier hired to replace
the same windows twice,

316
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,766
three weeks apart.

317
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,199
One of Hardcastle's
former employees told me

318
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,232
intimidation
was his trademark.

319
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,465
I believe your brother
was being pressured to sell,

320
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,266
and breaking windows
was one such tool.

321
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,999
Clarence, I want you
to send a message

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,132
to Inspector Wellington.

323
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,665
See if Mr. Turner
filed a complaint

324
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,499
about his windows being smashed.

325
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,965
Oh, and, um,
see if you can get me

326
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,832
copies of the murder file.

327
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,632
I don't hold out much
hope that Detective Black

328
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,999
has been particularly
comprehensive

329
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,865
in his investigation
so far,

330
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,465
but, uh, you never know.

331
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,899
What is it?

332
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,065
Uh, some flowers were
left for you on the doorstep.

333
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,465
Inspector Wellington,
no doubt.

334
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:34,265
He does hate it
when we're at odds.

335
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,899
They're not
from the inspector,

336
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,699
nor from anyone else
who wishes you well.

337
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,966
It is, I, I believe,
a threat.

338
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,032
God's sake--
can you please remove

339
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,199
this gentleman
from the corridor?

340
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,999
Put him in a cell
if you have to.

341
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,232
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,365
Sir, I have a message
from Miss Scarlet.

343
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,099
Ah.

344
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,099
It's a question
about the undertaker.

345
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,599
Detective Black
is leading that investigation.

346
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,099
Give it to him.
Actually, sir,

347
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,732
he handed in his notice.

348
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,299
Um, one crime scene was enough
for him, so...
Where's Charlie?

349
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,465
Detective Phelps is still
in Leeds on the Haymarket case.

350
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:26,632
Fine, get me the file.

351
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,299
It seems like I'll be doing this
myself,

352
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,366
with all my spare time.
Very good, sir.

353
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,300
And was there something else,
Detective?

354
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,799
Actually, yes, um, sir.

355
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,799
An opportunity has arisen,
in New York.

356
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,765
They've invited a detective
from Scotland Yard

357
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,665
to join their police department
for a year's secondment.

358
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,199
Sir.
And I thought about applying.

359
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,565
What do you think, sir?

360
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,065
I think the last thing I need
is to be another man down.

361
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,432
Ah.

362
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:56,999
Yes, of course.

363
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,099
I realize this might
not have been

364
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,599
the best time to mention it.

365
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,032
Oliver, if you're asking whether
I will support your application,

366
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,865
then, of course, I will--
perhaps we can find

367
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:07,532
a more convenient time
to discuss it?

368
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:10,100
Yes, sir, of course, sir.

369
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,399
So, this file?

370
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,100
Yes! Yes, sir!

371
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,099
Miss Manners.

372
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,066
Yes--
Mr. Hardcastle, I presume.

373
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:53,033
My condolences on the passing
of your great-aunt.

374
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,365
My assistant informed me
you were hoping

375
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,099
I would personally handle

376
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,465
the day-to-day arrangements
of the funeral.

377
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,232
But due to my workload,

378
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,333
I'm afraid that's not going
to be possible.

379
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,099
Oh, no.
But Mr. Ashley here

380
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,799
will look after you

381
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,266
and provide you with
round-the-clock assistance.

382
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,065
It was nice to have met you.

383
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,765
Oh, well, if I cannot rely
on the services

384
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,799
of the director in charge
of the company,

385
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,665
then it is with a heavy heart
that I must go elsewhere.

386
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,065
Which is such a shame,

387
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:25,732
since I did so want

388
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:29,965
the best in town to oversee
the funeral of my beloved aunt.

389
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:31,632
There'll be people
of great influence

390
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,599
and import in attendance.

391
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,799
No expense will be spared.

392
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,565
Um, do you know, Miss Manners,

393
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:41,399
I believe I can rearrange

394
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,066
some of my schedule
to accommodate you.

395
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,799
Yes, shall we?

396
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,865
This is from
our premium range.

397
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:57,132
Handmade from
the finest Canadian elm.

398
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:59,932
Lined with exquisite satin

399
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:02,032
from the very best manufacturers
in Paris.

400
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,199
It's very nice, indeed.

401
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,199
Hm.

402
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,565
Excuse me, sir--
there's an Inspector Wellington

403
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:10,700
here from Scotland Yard.

404
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,499
What are you doing here?

405
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,199
Do you know
Miss Manners?

406
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,400
Well, yes, of course.

407
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,799
Three years ago, you assisted
with an investigation

408
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,032
into a theft from my carriage
on Bond Street.

409
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:27,366
Miss Manners, remember?

410
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,666
Miss Manners.

411
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,799
Yes, I remember now.

412
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,366
Miss Scarlet,
what are you doing here?

413
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,465
Who is Miss Scarlet?

414
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,565
What do you mean,
she's a private detective?

415
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,032
I believe Miss Scarlet
is investigating the case

416
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:53,132
of the dead
Mr. Theobald Turner.

417
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,232
As am I.

418
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:57,999
It's come to our attention

419
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,232
that you were putting pressure
on Mr. Turner to sell.

420
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:02,365
He filed a complaint
about

421
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:04,065
some windows of his
being smashed,

422
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,265
and he believed
that that was connected to you.

423
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:08,099
What nonsense.

424
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,865
I know nothing
of any windows being broken.

425
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:14,133
There was merely
a healthy rivalry between us.

426
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,432
A former employee claims
that you sell funeral plans

427
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:20,565
to the poor who cannot
afford the repayments.

428
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,765
You then introduce them

429
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,999
to a moneylender,
who uses strong-arm tactics

430
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,599
when they default
on what they owe.

431
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,032
You speak of Albert Edmunds?

432
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,899
Let me tell you,
it's nothing more

433
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,965
than sour grapes
on account of his dismissal.

434
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:33,266
The man was useless.

435
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,865
Where were you on
the morning of Tuesday

436
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:39,100
last week, Mr. Hardcastle?

437
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:43,300
You are not seriously
asking me to give you an alibi?

438
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,932
I was coming back from a family
gathering in Eastbourne

439
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:53,133
with my wife and children.

440
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,400
I wonder if you could
identify this.

441
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:01,365
It came with some flowers
that were left for me yesterday.

442
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:04,332
Clearly a warning.

443
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,633
The card matches those
used by your firm, does it not?

444
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:10,265
Well, clearly,
someone is trying to defame me.

445
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:13,465
Why on Earth would I use
my own calling card?

446
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:20,465
Don't blame me.

447
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:22,632
All I am saying is
that your Detective Black

448
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,465
clearly missed evidence
that Mr. Turner

449
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,232
was being intimidated
by Hardcastle.

450
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,699
He's not my Detective Black--
I hardly knew the man.

451
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,265
He was drafted in from Essex
to address the lack of manpower.

452
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:35,132
We need at least 15
experienced detectives,

453
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,299
and the super sent us one
barely out of uniform.

454
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,332
Have you been in
to Scotland Yard recently?

455
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,665
You can hardly get
into reception-- it's chaos.

456
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:46,065
I'm very pleased you've
taken on the case, William.

457
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,899
But if you're so busy,

458
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,332
you should never have agreed

459
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,332
to stop using the services
of private investigators.

460
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,532
So, you are blaming me.

461
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,700
I have to blame someone.

462
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,999
So, what else have you
found out?

463
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,165
That there was a witness
who saw a heavyset man

464
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,365
with dark hair and a prominent
scar on his cheek

465
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:08,599
leaving the scene after Mr.
Turner's windows were smashed.

466
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,899
That certainly doesn't
sound like Hardcastle,

467
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,499
and we've no proof
that he arranged it.

468
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,065
Hm.

469
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:19,065
I don't like the idea
that someone is threatening you.

470
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:21,399
I get threatened
all the time, William.

471
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,732
Surely, I've been doing
this job long enough

472
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:23,865
for you to be comfortable
with that.

473
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:25,700
I'll never be comfortable
with that.

474
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,065
Miss Scarlet.

475
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:32,365
Oh, Inspector.

476
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,065
Mr. Potts.
Mr. Potts.

477
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,899
I, I have come
for my daily briefing,

478
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,500
but, uh...

479
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:42,432
Do I gather by
your presence, Inspector,

480
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,365
that you are now involved
in this case?

481
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:45,732
I am.

482
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:47,732
Oh, that's reassuring, indeed!

483
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:49,732
Well, thank you,
Mr. Potts.

484
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:51,732
It's nice to know
that someone appreciates me.

485
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:54,432
So, if that is the case,
then,

486
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:57,433
I no longer require
Miss Scarlet's assistance.

487
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,999
Firstly, Mr. Potts, please
address that question to me.

488
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,299
And secondly,
may I remind you,

489
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,165
we have a contractual
agreement.

490
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,232
I'm afraid you are
stuck with me.

491
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:11,765
Yes, well, I should
get back to Scotland Yard.

492
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:14,065
I'll leave you
to your briefing.

493
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:15,899
Yes, thank you, William.

494
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,132
Ah, yes, thank you, Will...
Inspector.

495
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,232
So, Mr. Turner did mention

496
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:28,766
that Hardcastle had tried
to intimidate him.

497
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,265
Yes-- on occasion.

498
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:34,166
But you never thought
to mention that to me.

499
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,099
I did...

500
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,332
I did not wish to speak ill
of my friend.

501
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,765
But I felt Theobald
had developed

502
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:44,900
an unhealthy obsession
with Mr. Hardcastle.

503
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:48,032
Blaming him for the failure
of his business,

504
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:50,999
and, oh, everything
in between.

505
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What do you class
as obsession?

506
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,299
At one point, he said he was
compiling a file on the man.

507
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,399
I had a rising concern

508
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,532
that Theobald had become
quite paranoid.

509
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,032
Come in, Miss Scarlet.

510
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,165
Just finishing off

511
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,200
packing the last of my brother's
personal effects.

512
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,999
Can I ask if you've found
a certain file

513
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,865
your brother kept
on Mr. Hardcastle?

514
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,865
I have, indeed.

515
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:28,265
I was planning to bring it
to your office.

516
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:32,366
But it's more
than just a file.

517
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,999
Complaints
to the Funeral Directors' Guild.

518
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,399
Newspaper articles about
Hardcastle's advertisements.

519
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,632
So, Barnabus was right.

520
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,999
His friend Mr. Turner

521
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,566
was utterly obsessed
with Mr. Hardcastle.

522
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,033
His broken windows.

523
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,700
This must refer to the
glazier's receipts I found.

524
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,532
He even has a list
of other undertakers

525
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,799
who appear to have their windows
smashed in the same manner.

526
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,533
He was obsessed,
and thorough.

527
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,066
He even kept the bricks?

528
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,465
They all have the same initials
on them.

529
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,733
"S.P."

530
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:35,699
Excuse me?

531
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,199
Excuse me.

532
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,899
I'm, uh, looking for
the proprietor, Mr. Petrov.

533
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,199
He's away from work.

534
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,066
Well, can you tell me
when he'll be back?

535
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:50,265
His wife, she died, and...

536
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:52,099
Only weeks after, his daughter.

537
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,699
He has not been in good way
for months now.

538
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,532
I'm sorry to hear that.

539
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,965
I'm looking for one
of his customers.

540
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,200
Dark hair,
scar on his cheek?

541
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,165
I don't know this man.

542
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,365
I must go back to work now.

543
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:09,365
I've, uh,

544
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,365
visited a number
of undertakers

545
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,432
who've had their windows
smashed with bricks

546
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,432
engraved with
Mr. Petrov's initials.

547
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:18,466
It's clear there's a link to
this business and the crimes.

548
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:22,099
I haven't yet told the police,
but will be forced

549
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,265
to do so if my inquiries
remain unanswered.

550
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,365
Mr. Petrov himself may be
implicated in the crimes,

551
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,200
which is surely
the last thing he needs.

552
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:36,665
The man with the scar
is a moneylender.

553
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,832
Tomasz Mazelli.

554
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:42,899
Mr. Petrov owed him
for his family's funerals.

555
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,832
He comes for regular payment.

556
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:49,465
Always takes a box of bricks,
which he never pays for.

557
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,965
Tell me, Eliza,

558
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,365
do you think
that you'll ever learn to knock?

559
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:06,699
Um, no.

560
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,899
I've secured the name
and work address

561
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,632
of the moneylender
Tomasz Mazelli.

562
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:13,232
He has an office off Long Acre--
shall we?

563
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:15,765
Well, I'm busy with a great
deal of other cases,

564
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:19,099
including that of a high-profile
robbery in Haymarket, so,

565
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,765
I will come to your case
when I can.

566
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:24,299
Of course.

567
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,265
So you'll wait.

568
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:28,165
No, William.

569
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,665
But as you say,

570
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,865
you're too busy to go
and see the man who was, uh,

571
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,032
almost probably the one
who sent me those lilies

572
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,032
and threatened my life.

573
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,532
But, uh...

574
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,832
Well, I'm sure I'll be fine

575
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,366
to visit such a dangerous,
violent criminal.

576
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:45,165
Alone.

577
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,699
I'm Inspector Wellington
from Scotland Yard.

578
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,799
Tomasz Mazelli around?

579
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,432
He's out.

580
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,165
Well, do you know
when he'll be back?

581
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,732
I don't know, darling.

582
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,033
What am I, his missus?

583
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,365
No, you're his clerk.

584
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:31,565
And if you don't show
the lady some courtesy,

585
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:32,899
then you and I will be
talking alone

586
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,365
in a dark room

587
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:38,365
with no witnesses.

588
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:39,599
Please help me!

589
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,599
Please, no!

590
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,032
Please! No, no, no!

591
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:52,832
Tomasz Mazelli, I presume?

592
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,965
You're under arrest.

593
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:57,033
Mr. Edmunds.

594
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,132
You know him?

595
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,833
He worked for Hardcastle.

596
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,365
I shouldn't have
reported Hardcastle.

597
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:09,932
This isn't your fault.

598
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,432
You need to see a doctor.

599
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,765
Can one be arranged

600
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,333
when he comes to Scotland Yard
to make a statement?

601
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,265
I'm not making a statement.

602
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,632
I can arrange protection--
there's nothing to be scared of.

603
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,665
That's easy for you to say.

604
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:24,165
I, I just want
to be left alone.

605
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,232
This is part of a murder
investigation, sir.

606
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:28,499
Now, I can't force you
to press charges,

607
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,665
but I would appreciate it

608
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,032
if you'd at least
make a statement.

609
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,599
I don't want anything
to do with this.

610
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,965
Just let me be!
Mr. Edmunds...

611
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,465
Leave me alone!
Albert!

612
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,565
Please just
leave me alone!

613
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,765
There must be something
you can do.

614
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:44,899
He's not under arrest--
I can't force him to come.

615
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,432
Let's see what Mazelli
has to say.

616
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,299
Excuse me, sir?

617
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,933
A message for Miss Scarlet.

618
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:57,566
Is there nowhere
I can hide from that man?

619
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,332
Oh! Miss Scarlet!

620
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,865
I feared you did not
get my note.

621
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,099
I was just on my way
to find you.

622
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,032
I came as quick as I could,
Mr. Potts.

623
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,399
Is all well?

624
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,232
Oh, not in the least.

625
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,532
Miss Turner came to see me,

626
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:19,166
to gift me an old board game
of Theobald's.

627
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,332
And this is what has upset you?

628
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,332
No.

629
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,532
It was the news she imparted

630
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,665
that caused me this distress.

631
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:28,399
Miss Turner,
contrary to the wishes

632
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,232
of her deceased brother

633
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:31,965
and my dear friend Theobald,

634
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:33,833
is to sell the funeral home
to Hardcastle's.

635
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:46,532
What do you know about the
murder of Mr. Theobald Turner?

636
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:48,532
Don't know him.

637
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:51,499
Well, a witness has you
smashing Mr. Turner's windows.

638
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,132
I believe that
that was on the orders

639
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:56,132
of another undertaker,
John Hardcastle.

640
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,299
Don't know him, either.

641
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,199
Hm.

642
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,266
Where were you
on Tuesday afternoon?

643
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,232
I was at the
Broad Street Hotel.

644
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:11,065
Went in for a drink.

645
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:13,932
I like one of
the waitresses there.

646
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,932
Oh, I've, uh...

647
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,699
I've dealt with many
moneylenders in the past,

648
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,932
and it's my experience
that all of them, bar none,

649
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,765
have a deep aversion

650
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,532
to paying their dues
to Her Majesty's Revenue.

651
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,699
And as I am sure you know,

652
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,932
as a businessman
in the financial sector,

653
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:40,932
avoidance of tax contributions
carries a hefty prison sentence.

654
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,765
You won't find nothing
on me.

655
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:46,865
Well, in that case,
you have nothing to fear

656
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:49,032
whilst we undertake
an investigation

657
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:51,099
into your
business dealings.

658
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,032
In the meantime,
your accounts

659
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,365
and all your assets
will be frozen.

660
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:56,899
Don't worry,
that won't take too long.

661
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,266
A couple of months
should do it.

662
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,132
What do you want from me?

663
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:06,266
Information about the day
that Mr. Turner died.

664
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,432
I was at the hotel
for Mr. Hardcastle.

665
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,732
He was being bothered by
some woman he'd clearly...

666
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,199
You know.

667
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,465
Been with.

668
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:21,099
He didn't want
his missus to find out.

669
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,732
So, he hired me
to pay her a visit

670
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,632
to encourage her
to leave the town.

671
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:29,965
I went to her room, 402,
but she never returned.

672
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:32,932
What was her name?

673
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,132
Yes, ma'am.

674
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,532
I'm looking for one of your
guests, a Miss Francesca Turner.

675
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:40,766
Mm-hmm.

676
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,265
She's in room 402.

677
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:47,832
Francesca Turner has been having
an affair with Hardcastle.

678
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:51,265
Miss Turner
has checked out, I'm afraid.

679
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:55,632
The day Mazelli was sent
to warn Miss Turner off

680
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:57,532
was the day that
her brother was murdered.

681
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,965
So, she was in London that day,
yet she never mentioned it.

682
00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:02,499
Which makes her
our prime suspect.

683
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,632
The question is,
where is she?

684
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,099
The lawyer who
dealt with the will

685
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,965
is likely to have her
home address in Bristol.

686
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,099
We can get it from him.

687
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,433
I'll send a message.

688
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,632
For Hardcastle
to go to the effort

689
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,332
of sending Mazelli
to scare her,

690
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,299
it seems likely she must have
wanted something from him.

691
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,432
Or just threatened
to tell his wife about them.

692
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:24,900
Let's ask the man himself.

693
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:32,399
I have a signed statement from
Tomasz Mazelli implicating you

694
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,399
in the intimidation
of Mr. Theobald Turner

695
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,665
in the weeks
leading up to his murder.

696
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,932
- Intimidation?
- The statement also claims

697
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:42,665
you were fraternizing
with Miss Francesca Turner.

698
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:45,399
Something your wife
might be interested to know.

699
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,199
Why did you send Tomasz Mazelli
to scare her off?

700
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,333
What did she want from you?

701
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,565
It's a personal matter.

702
00:36:53,566 --> 00:36:55,099
Well, perhaps you'd feel
more comfortable if we

703
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,200
invited Mrs. Hardcastle in
to join us.

704
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,999
I have never been unfaithful
to my wife.

705
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,132
Francesca and I,
it was more...

706
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,732
More than 20 years ago.

707
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:18,432
And yes, I was engaged
to my wife at the time,

708
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:19,999
but we weren't married.

709
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,166
And yet you've seen
Miss Turner recently.

710
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,766
She'd fallen on hard times
and come to me for money.

711
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:31,399
When I was unwilling
to help her out,

712
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,332
she threatened
to tell my wife about us.

713
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,765
That's why I sent Mazelli.

714
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:37,465
Plain and simple.

715
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,765
Do you believe it was money

716
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:54,599
Miss Turner
went to see him about?

717
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,065
It's possible.

718
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,432
I suppose if she was
desperate for money

719
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,332
and Hardcastle refused,

720
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,999
perhaps she then went
to call on her brother

721
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,565
and it went badly wrong?

722
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:07,732
Something still
feels amiss here.

723
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,432
Well, let's see what
comes back from Bristol.

724
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:11,932
As soon as Miss Turner
arrives home,

725
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,965
the police will be
waiting for her.

726
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,299
Right.

727
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,265
I need to update the super
on the Haymarket robbery.

728
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,732
You're having a meeting
at...

729
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:21,265
10:00 at night?

730
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,499
Yes, Eliza,
this place never sleeps.

731
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,865
Go home.

732
00:38:24,866 --> 00:38:26,233
We'll pick this up
in the morning, all right?

733
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:35,799
Where's the inspector?

734
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,065
I have a message
regarding Miss Turner.

735
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,632
What, they found her?

736
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:41,899
No, but the Bristol police
spoke to her neighbor.

737
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,632
He said Miss Turner moved in

738
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:45,499
when she married her husband
18 years previous.

739
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,465
Her husband passed
earlier this year.

740
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,199
- Oi, his lordship!
- I need you.

741
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,099
Charlie--
didn't know you were back.

742
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,299
Miss me, did you?
Oh, I'm touched.

743
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,199
Now stop batting your eyelashes
at Miss Scarlet

744
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,700
and get a move on.

745
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,232
You go.

746
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,699
I'll give it
to Inspector Wellington.

747
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:12,866
"Francesca Turner married
a Peter Edmunds..."

748
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:16,932
Edmunds.

749
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,132
Albert Edmunds.

750
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,965
Excuse me.
Hm?

751
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,865
Is a Mr. Edmunds here?

752
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:28,299
No, love.

753
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,065
I'm picking up him
and his mother next.

754
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:32,465
You're picking them up
from where?

755
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:01,200
One moment, Miss Scarlet.

756
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:08,932
Cannot talk for long.

757
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:12,499
Carriage is on its way to
take me to the railway station.

758
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,565
You and your son.

759
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,799
I know you are
Albert Edmunds' mother,

760
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,900
Miss Turner.

761
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,032
And I'm right in thinking
that

762
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:28,400
Mr. Hardcastle is his father.

763
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:34,265
That's why you went to him
for money.

764
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,465
Yes.

765
00:40:41,466 --> 00:40:43,433
Albert is my son.

766
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,665
But from my marriage
to Peter Edmunds,

767
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,100
who is now deceased.

768
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:53,065
You were only married to him
for 18 years.

769
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,965
I checked the census--
Albert is 21.

770
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,632
I believe you left London

771
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,399
because you became
pregnant by a man

772
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,332
both your father
and brother despised.

773
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,600
That's why you were
estranged, isn't it?

774
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,332
You were also in London

775
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,165
the day of
your brother's murder.

776
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:26,366
You went to Hardcastle to
look for your son, didn't you?

777
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,399
But he turned you away.

778
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,065
So then what?
You went to your brother

779
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:33,933
to see if he knew
where Albert was, is...

780
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:36,832
Is that what happened?

781
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:41,432
When I, when I saw
my brother,

782
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:44,032
the resentment from the past,
it gripped us both.

783
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:45,199
We had, we had an argument.

784
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,666
I became angry, and...

785
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,299
Pushed him.

786
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,365
It was an accident.

787
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,865
The police are on their way--
I'll...

788
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:04,265
I'll go to Scotland Yard
with you to make a statement.

789
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:07,265
No, no, no, no,
I, I want to go now.

790
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:11,100
Where is your son,
Miss Turner?

791
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,165
Um, he's left London.

792
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,665
I gave him the money from
the sale of the business.

793
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,732
He's, um,
he's heading to France.

794
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:22,099
Start a new life.

795
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,265
There's no sense in waiting--
let, let's go now.

796
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:27,365
Just one moment.

797
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:29,032
But, please!

798
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:30,999
I, I just want
to get this over with!

799
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:39,599
The bells were caused
by the draft from the window.

800
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,100
It's nothing.

801
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,199
The window's not open,
Miss Turner.

802
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,865
Will you please just
take me to Scotland Yard

803
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,566
so this matter can be closed?

804
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:03,566
Your son isn't on his way
to France, is he?

805
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:11,065
Where is he, Miss Turner?

806
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:13,466
I don't know
what you're talking about.

807
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,732
This is ridiculous!

808
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:49,299
He is not here, nor has he
done anything wrong!

809
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:55,632
Run!

810
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:04,732
You're not going anywhere,
son.

811
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:06,132
Albert, no, please.

812
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:07,232
No, please!

813
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,565
Get him in the wagon.

814
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:10,199
No, please, please,
let my boy go!

815
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,232
He didn't mean to do
anything wrong.

816
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,732
It was an accident!

817
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:14,732
Come on.

818
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:16,832
- Please!
- Mother!

819
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,232
Please...

820
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:20,265
Please help me, Mother!

821
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,866
Please...

822
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:26,332
I'd just turned 21

823
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,566
when my mother
told me the truth.

824
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,965
That the man who died
earlier this year

825
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:34,499
wasn't my real father.

826
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,699
And I was relieved.

827
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,665
He was a horrible drunk.

828
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,132
Led her a miserable life.

829
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:42,832
Taking on a woman
with an illegitimate child

830
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:46,032
made him think he could do
whatever he liked

831
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:48,899
and she would just
have to put up with it.

832
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,665
When he died, she went back
to her maiden name.

833
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,500
That's how much
she hated him.

834
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,033
So you came to London
to find your real father?

835
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:01,165
We'd rowed about the fact
she'd lied to me, and I left.

836
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,732
I traveled here
and got a job

837
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,299
as an apprentice
at Hardcastle's.

838
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,632
A few months later,
I plucked up the courage

839
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:10,465
and told him who I was.

840
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:12,165
I just

841
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,699
wanted him to acknowledge
he was my father.

842
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,365
I didn't want
anything from him.

843
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:18,700
But he rejected you.

844
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:22,899
So, I went to see my uncle,
and he turned me away, too,

845
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,199
and I got so angry.

846
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,999
The way they'd treated
my mother all these years,

847
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,033
and now me.

848
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,232
The fury just took me over,
and,

849
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:36,532
and I, I pushed him.

850
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,733
And he hit his head.

851
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,965
Your mother was in town
that day, too.

852
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:42,265
Oh, no, no!

853
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:44,265
She had no part in this,
I swear it.

854
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:46,232
She came looking for me.

855
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:49,432
Went to Hardcastle's and
found out he'd sacked me.

856
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:50,799
She spent the next few days

857
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,799
trying to find out
where I was staying,

858
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,132
but London is a big place.

859
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:57,832
When Mazelli got hold of me,

860
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,799
he told me he'd been
to visit my mother at the hotel.

861
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,632
It was only then
that I knew she was in town,

862
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,765
and I went to find her.

863
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,232
I told her where I'd been.

864
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:09,465
And what I'd done.

865
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,132
I needed my mother.

866
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:14,599
I needed her help.

867
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,065
I was the only man in her life
who ever loved her.

868
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:21,465
And now I've
broken her heart, too.

869
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,799
That poor woman has lost
the only child she had.

870
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,433
She has no family now.

871
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,300
I know what that's like.

872
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:50,932
I'm your family, William.

873
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,099
Do I not annoy you
like a younger sister?

874
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,699
Frequently.

875
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:03,699
Sorry to disturb, Skipper,
but I've got news

876
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,999
on the Haymarket robbery--
my snitch from up north

877
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,832
has just come through,
he's given up

878
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,366
a possible location
where the gang are hiding.

879
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:11,832
Excellent, Charlie.

880
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,799
Alert the men to come
to my office immediately

881
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,065
and let the super know

882
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:16,332
we'll carry out a raid
first thing.

883
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,565
Yes, Skip.

884
00:47:17,566 --> 00:47:19,600
I'll leave you to it.

885
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,132
Eliza, I was wondering...

886
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,432
Are you free to dine
tomorrow evening?

887
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:30,499
But we've only just had
our monthly dinner.

888
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,766
Well, I can overlook that
if you can.

889
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,766
Tomorrow evening it is, then.

890
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:04,399
It was nice doing business
with you, Mr. Potts.

891
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,832
Well, Miss Scarlet,

892
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,632
I, I'd like to say
it was...

893
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:09,999
It was a relief
that the culprit was found.

894
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,432
And that Mr. Hardcastle
and his moneylender

895
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:14,432
will also face
some consequences, so...

896
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,399
So, yes, a satisfying conclusion
all round.

897
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,065
It was, as you say, a,
a satisfying conclusion,

898
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,532
so I wonder
if you have any comments

899
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,099
on my handling of the case,
Mr. Potts.

900
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,833
What?

901
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,765
You did a very, um,

902
00:48:31,766 --> 00:48:34,165
capable job, Miss Scarlet.

903
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,365
Thank you.

904
00:48:36,366 --> 00:48:38,465
I'm just happy to be able to
demonstrate my professionalism.

905
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:39,799
Hm.

906
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,899
So, if, in the future,
Miss Scarlet

907
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,865
did feel the need
to call on you

908
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:47,365
for some kind of
dispensation,

909
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:49,232
for example,

910
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:51,499
access to the mortuary,

911
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,599
perhaps you will find
that she's only

912
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,965
the very best of intentions

913
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:57,099
and poses no threat

914
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,832
to your protocol, Barnabus.

915
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,232
Oh...

916
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,233
Oh, perhaps
we may agree that from...

917
00:49:07,433 --> 00:49:10,000
...now on you are able
to enter the mortuary.

918
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,300
Uh, under police supervision,
of course.

919
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,765
Well, I must be getting
to work.

920
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:25,065
Oh, and I won't be home
for dinner, Ivy.

921
00:49:25,066 --> 00:49:26,733
I will be dining with Inspector
Wellington this evening.

922
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,232
What?

923
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,799
Nothing, I just thought

924
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,665
you had your monthly dinner
quite recently.

925
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:35,400
Still keeping count, I see.

926
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,599
Mr. Potts.

927
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,133
Miss Scarlet.

928
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,833
Thank you, my dear.

929
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:01,865
Where've you been?

930
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,199
And where's the backup?

931
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,799
I've got bad news, sir.

932
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,565
The super diverted
the uniforms to Hatton Garden.

933
00:50:06,566 --> 00:50:07,965
Some diamond heist gone wrong.

934
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,233
Three dead, apparently.

935
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:11,465
- Well?
- I've been round the back.

936
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,832
From what I can see,
they're on the move.

937
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,465
Gathering their things.

938
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:15,999
This might be
the last chance we get

939
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,499
to nab these scum,
Skipper.

940
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,099
But there's too many exits
for us to cover, sir.

941
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,300
We need more men.

942
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,799
We're going in.

943
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,899
Charlie, you go around
the back-- you, go with him.
Sir.

944
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,299
You take the side entrance
to the left.

945
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,733
Fitzroy, you're with me--
we'll go through the front.

946
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,165
Remember, lads, we have
the advantage of surprise,

947
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,632
so let's show them
who they're dealing with.

948
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:41,199
All right?

949
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,199
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

950
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,299
Let's go.

951
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,332
Come on, lads.

952
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,999
Right, let's go, boys.

953
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:03,999
Police! Put down your weapons!

954
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,799
I said put them down, now!

955
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:38,399
Detective Fitzroy.

956
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,332
Miss Scarlet...

957
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,199
Eliza...

958
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,465
What is it?
What's happened?

959
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:48,700
It's Inspector Wellington.

960
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,400
What about him?

961
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,465
He's been shot.

962
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,132
They're performing
surgery, but...

963
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:00,432
They're not optimistic.

964
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:03,699
They cannot say for certain
if he will survive.

965
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,932
Lizzie!

966
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,532
You've been expelled!

967
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:21,299
You're 16 years old, Lizzie!

968
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,499
It's time you grew up!

969
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,465
My name's Detective
Inspector Henry Scarlet.

970
00:52:24,466 --> 00:52:26,432
And you are?
William Wellington.

971
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:27,432
Wellington, as in the duke?

972
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:28,565
Hello again.

973
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:29,932
