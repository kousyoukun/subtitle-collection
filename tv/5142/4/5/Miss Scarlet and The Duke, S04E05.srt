1
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:04,132
How is the patient
this morning?

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,465
Your future's at Scotland Yard.

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:06,732
I don't think
that's ever been in question.

4
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,432
I'm not talking about work.

5
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,632
Bonjour, Eliza.

6
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,332
There's really no need for you
to be here.

7
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,265
I'm staying in London until this
ship is back on course.

8
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,865
I'm going to New York.

9
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,065
For a year?

10
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,632
This isn't goodbye.

11
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:22,800
It's goodbye for now.

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,365
Morning, miss-- post.

13
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:08,566
Thank you.

14
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:22,166
Goodness.
Indeed.

15
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,565
Good morning, Eliza.

16
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,199
Clarence.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,532
I hope that's not full
of bills.

18
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,232
Applications.

19
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:32,932
We've had
an overwhelming response

20
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,699
to our advert
for new detectives.

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,932
I suppose my reputation
does precede me.

22
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:40,465
It's more likely they heard
of the female detective.

23
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,699
The advert was quite clear
who they'd be dealing with.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,299
Remind me whose name
is above the door.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,465
Yours,
and your sons'.

26
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:50,732
Well, no time
like the present.

27
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,233
Shall we begin?

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,165
Oh, this one's good.

29
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,566
23 years at Bow Street--
what does that tell you?

30
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,732
That he lacks ambition.

31
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,200
Unlike Mr. Samuel Walsh.

32
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,399
Can't spell the word
"detective."

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,765
Or the word "criminal."

34
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,266
Or his own name.

35
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,032
Him.

36
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,432
Fired him last year.

37
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,366
Him?
Too young.

38
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,065
He's too old.

39
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,665
Don't trust him.

40
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,132
Don't like him.

41
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,600
Him.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,433
He's been in prison.

43
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,033
Surely we can at least
agree on this chap.

44
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,832
I've said no to him
twice already.

45
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,032
Stop trying to sneak
him through.
We've been at this all day,

46
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,499
and so far you've liked
none of my choices.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,032
Any more
than you've liked mine.

48
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,665
It'll be me
who works with them.

49
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,800
And me who pays for them--
I am the boss.

50
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,865
So you keep reminding me.

51
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,665
Surely some of the applicants
are acceptable to you both.

52
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,665
Ask him.

53
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,033
Ask her.

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,465
Good morning.

55
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,332
Morning.

56
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,333
I was just practicing
my handwriting.

57
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,599
Looked to me
like you were writing a letter.

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,099
Fine.

59
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,199
I was writing a letter.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,365
To?

61
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,832
Barnabus.

62
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,665
Oh.

63
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,233
Hm.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,965
Lizzie!

65
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,500
What are you up to?

66
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,699
Why are you writing
to Inspector Wellington?

67
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,732
Because you aren't.

68
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,799
What?
He wrote to me.

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,199
He said he's sent you
three letters

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
and you've not replied
to any of them.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,332
I don't want any breakfast--
I'll be late for work.

72
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,265
Lizzie, you've not spoken
of Inspector Wellington

73
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,732
since he's been gone.

74
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,032
Perhaps it might help
to do so.

75
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,665
You're clearly upset
and angry with him.

76
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,365
I'm not upset,
nor am I angry.

77
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,999
I'm absolutely fine.

78
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,799
If we are to be together,

79
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,265
then I cannot remain
at Scotland Yard

80
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,532
with you a private detective,

81
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:43,565
nor can I be around you
anymore without...

82
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:47,232
Without being with you.

83
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,332
Yes.

84
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,765
Uh, sorry to disturb,

85
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,865
but Mr. Nash would like you
to meet him right away.

86
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,432
What for?

87
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,300
To meet a new client.

88
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,865
What new client?

89
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,632
Patrick.

90
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,200
Eliza.

91
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,732
What is this place?

92
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,399
This... is the future.

93
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,065
Reception-- may I help you?

94
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,665
- Reception?
- Yes, sir.

95
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,700
Mr. Bracewell.
Certainly, sir.

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,165
Do you know much
about the telephone?
Not much.

97
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:15,499
I know it was invented in 1875
by Alexander Graham Bell.

98
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,932
There were,
of course, counterclaims

99
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,899
as to who first came up
with the innovation,

100
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,632
but Bell was the first
to patent it.

101
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,165
Nine years on,
it's really only the preserve

102
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,065
of the rich
and the privileged,

103
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:28,265
given how costly it is
to install and run.

104
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:31,865
Although this year
has seen telephone stations

105
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,232
installed in
various public places.

106
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,532
Shops, telegraph offices.

107
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,632
A yes or no
would have sufficed.

108
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:43,932
As you say, it's being made more
accessible to ordinary folk.

109
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,065
It's the new gold rush.

110
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,966
This place is
at the forefront.

111
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:53,099
So, why are we here?

112
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,099
The owner of Britannia
wants us

113
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,899
to negate some rather
bad publicity.

114
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,033
Yes, Mr. Bracewell.

115
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,633
Mr. Bracewell
will see you now.

116
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:05,465
Extraordinary.

117
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,033
It certainly is.

118
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,232
Britannia have
an engineering workshop

119
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,365
where they design new ways
to improve their product.

120
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:16,299
Two days ago, it was
destroyed by a gas explosion.

121
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,599
Two men were killed: a young
inventor named Alfred Baker

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,765
and the co-founder
of the company, George Davidson.

123
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,432
So there was a gas leak.

124
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:24,999
According to the newspapers,

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,732
the police think Davidson
lighting his pipe

126
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,132
is what ignited
the explosion.

127
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,699
But as for the gas leak,

128
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,899
it seems someone tampered
with the supply.

129
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,265
And the police believe
that this someone

130
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,599
works here at Britannia.

131
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,432
Not just someone.

132
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,600
Our new client,
Joseph Bracewell.

133
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:48,132
My aim, Mr. Nash,
is to put a Britannia telephone

134
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,465
into every household
in the country.

135
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,465
Once we've done that,

136
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,932
we will move
into the international markets.

137
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,565
I applaud your ambition,
Mr. Bracewell.

138
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,865
I must confess,
I've not yet used one of these.

139
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,832
To, to help you fully,
Mr. Bracewell,

140
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,799
perhaps we should
try it ourselves.

141
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,832
Be my guest.

142
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,199
Good afternoon,
Britannia Exchange.

143
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,199
What number do you require?

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,599
Ask for the stock exchange.

145
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,132
Uh, the stock exchange,
please.

146
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,932
Connecting you now--
please wait one moment.

147
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:33,699
Ask for the latest Britannia
share price.

148
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,232
Stock exchange,
how can I help you?

149
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,832
Uh, please could you advise
on the current share price

150
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,932
for the Britannia Telephone
Company?

151
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,632
- One and six.
- One and six.

152
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,265
Thank you.

153
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,633
Goodbye.

154
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:54,265
All this dire publicity
has caused the value

155
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,999
of my company
to fall by the hour.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,465
Which is why I need you
to get the police off my back

157
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,465
and find out who is responsible
for this terrible deed.

158
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,032
They have a ridiculous notion

159
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,432
that I wanted George Davidson
dead.

160
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,799
Your business partner?

161
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,965
We founded the company
together.

162
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:15,899
I felt the time was right
to expand.

163
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,099
To buy out our rivals.

164
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,499
And Mr. Davidson
disagreed?

165
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,799
This disagreement
was a minor issue,

166
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,665
not reason for me
to kill him.

167
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,732
I gather the police
suspect you

168
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,499
because you were supposed
to attend this meeting

169
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,432
with Mr. Davidson,
but you didn't turn up.

170
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,099
We had another argument
that morning.

171
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,832
I simply wasn't in the mood
to face him.

172
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,999
I spent the afternoon here
in my office.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,632
But that was unusual,

174
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:44,999
was it not?

175
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,832
That you didn't attend
that weekly meeting?

176
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,432
Unheard of,
according to the newspapers.

177
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:52,633
Do not believe everything
you read in the newspapers.

178
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,499
Did you have any grievance with
the other man that was killed,

179
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,599
the, uh, the young inventor,
Alfred Baker?

180
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,699
No.

181
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,632
And for your information,

182
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:03,899
Alfred wasn't meant to be
at that meeting.

183
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,065
We have to ask these questions,
Mr. Bracewell,

184
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,932
so that we're clear on
all the details of this case.

185
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:12,965
Well, in that case, let me
be crystal-clear with you.

186
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:16,032
I did not murder
George Davidson.

187
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,665
As for Alfred Baker,

188
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,799
he'd just designed the telephone

189
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,932
that would make this company
a fortune.

190
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,900
Why on Earth
would I want him dead?

191
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,565
Why in God's name did you
interrogate him like that?

192
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,765
You clearly weren't going
to ask him anything useful.

193
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:39,765
I've never seen you so
in awe.

194
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,565
I was not in awe, I just
think him an impressive man.

195
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,599
A visionary.
I think him rather unsavory.

196
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,899
Ah, you disagree
with my judge of character.

197
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,365
Quelle surprise.

198
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,965
What of my judgment?

199
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,965
I'm the one who's going to be
running the office.

200
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:52,599
I should choose my own staff.
Oh, I see.

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,132
That's what this is about,
is it?

202
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,832
That's the reason
for this latest sulk du jour.

203
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,699
I do not sulk.
We will discuss this matter
another time.

204
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,065
Right now, we need
to visit the crime scene.

205
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,899
Finally, something
we agree on.

206
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,099
Go fetch my carriage.

207
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,399
Detective Phelps--
just the man.

208
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,365
Inspector Phelps, actually--
well, soon to be.

209
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,599
You're taking over
from Inspector Wellington?

210
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,799
But there's been
no formal announcement.

211
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,765
Just needs to be
rubber-stamped.

212
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,133
And why hasn't it been?

213
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,165
Well, I'm sure
it's just a matter of time.

214
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,532
May I offer
my congratulations

215
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:37,299
on what will be
a well-deserved promotion.

216
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,832
So, I assume your presence here
is not just to keep me company.

217
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,599
As ever, you assume right.

218
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,065
We've been hired to investigate
the Britannia explosion,

219
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,432
and we'd like to take a look
at the crime scene.

220
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,432
I take it your fire experts
have assessed the scene?

221
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,099
Still waiting.

222
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,899
They've been held up elsewhere,
which is a bugger,

223
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,299
'cause we can't progress
with the case

224
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,999
until they've had a gander.

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,799
Well, perhaps
in the meantime,

226
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,832
you might allow us to look
for ourselves.
Hm.

227
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,032
Good one-- now hop it!

228
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,799
I see the prospect of
a promotion hasn't endowed you

229
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,233
with any more decorum,
Detective Phelps.

230
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,299
Let me give you some advice,
Miss Scarlet.

231
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,032
I'm the skipper now.

232
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,132
So you need to start showing me
a bit of respect.

233
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,832
Oh, I've always seen respect
as something you earn.

234
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,165
Oh, how Miss Scarlet
does like to jest.

235
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,965
You surely know that our respect
for you is unimpeachable,

236
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,865
Inspector Phelps,

237
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,932
and we'd be
most grateful...

238
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,532
Under no circumstances
let them inside.

239
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,732
Yes, sir.

240
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,332
Even if the queen
herself comes down here

241
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,366
and says you'll be hanged
for treason if you don't...

242
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,499
...still don't let them in.

243
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,800
That went well.

244
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,699
Well, we're not all
blessed

245
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,232
with your powers
of duplicity, Patrick.

246
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,932
If by that you mean
charm and persuasion

247
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,332
to keep my business afloat,

248
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,700
well, then perhaps you should
try it sometime.

249
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,565
Whether you like it or not,

250
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:02,266
you have to learn
to play the game.

251
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,599
What is wrong with you
at the moment?

252
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,632
This can't just be
about the hiring of staff.

253
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,532
Is this about
your inspector leaving?

254
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:14,200
Nothing is wrong with me--
he's not my inspector.

255
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,865
What I'm about to say
you may not like--

256
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,732
in fact,
you definitely won't like it.

257
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:25,265
Well, then perhaps
you shouldn't say it.

258
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:28,065
The work you've had up until
now from Scotland Yard

259
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,965
has been on account
of your friendship

260
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:31,632
with Inspector Wellington.
I secured that work because
I'm good at what I do.

261
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,032
And I'm not disputing that,

262
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,765
but the fact remains, your
friendship helped a great deal.

263
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:35,765
But now Phelps is in charge,

264
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,199
he's not obliged
to tolerate you.

265
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,265
Tolerate me?

266
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,965
Do you want this business
to flourish

267
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,232
under your command or not?

268
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,532
Yes, of course I do.

269
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,532
Then make it your business
to get along with Phelps.

270
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,232
And will you please
stop sulking?!

271
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,699
For the last time,
I do not sulk!

272
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,132
Good, because
my mother was a sulker

273
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,432
and it brings back
bad memories.

274
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,499
Fine.

275
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,532
What do you want me to do,
go back to him and grovel?
No.

276
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,765
That ship has sailed.

277
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,599
I'll attempt to obtain
crime scene photos

278
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,032
from my usual source.

279
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,899
Well, in the meantime,

280
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,032
let's do some digging
on our dead men.

281
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,199
I suggest we start
with the young inventor.

282
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,699
Speak to his widow.

283
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,765
See if anyone had a grudge.

284
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,700
You both look very happy.

285
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:43,432
How long were you married,
Mrs. Baker?

286
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,099
Six months.

287
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,699
And it's Betty.

288
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,666
Your husband was an avid reader.

289
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:56,365
He had every book
on engineering imaginable.

290
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:59,699
They were his pride and joy.

291
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,532
Mrs. Baker...

292
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:04,032
Betty.

293
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:08,632
Can you think of anyone who had
a grudge against your husband?

294
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,733
And take your time.

295
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,199
Uh, Daniel Archer.

296
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,399
He, uh, works at Britannia.

297
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,765
Alfred started
as his apprentice.

298
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,332
He was full of resentment

299
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,032
'cause Britannia wanted to go
with Alfred's design

300
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,832
for their new telephone,
not his.

301
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,032
His boss, Mr. Davidson,
said he'd be famous.

302
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:33,199
He called it
"an ingenious invention."

303
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,100
And Mr. Archer
wasn't happy.

304
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,399
My husband believed he tried

305
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,865
to steal his plans
for the new telephone.

306
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:44,600
And what made him think that?

307
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,933
He hid them.

308
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,699
Under the floorboard
in his office.

309
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,699
As insurance, he said,

310
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,433
on account of it being
such a competitive industry.

311
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,365
Then, one day, last month,

312
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,265
he found Mr. Archer
in his office

313
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:06,799
looking shifty, my husband said.

314
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,332
When he'd gone,
Alfred said the rug

315
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,132
that covered the floorboard
had been disturbed.

316
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,065
How would Mr. Archer have known

317
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,932
where your husband
hid his plans?

318
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,965
Well, Alfred couldn't
work it out.

319
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:20,832
Mr. Davidson would never
have told anyone.

320
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,265
He was as worried as Alfred

321
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:23,999
about keeping the new design
a secret.

322
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,665
And where are the plans now?

323
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,433
Alfred moved them.

324
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,699
He didn't tell me where.

325
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,432
But he was certain
Mr. Archer was after them.

326
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,132
So, you're working
on your own design

327
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,699
for Britannia's new telephone,
Mr. Archer.

328
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,465
Hm, it will be
a great improvement,

329
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,565
most notably in terms

330
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,765
of sound quality
and reliability.

331
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:54,365
I understand
that Alfred Baker

332
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,699
had designed a new telephone,
as well.

333
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,499
They're calling it
the Upright.

334
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,399
Woeful name.

335
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,132
Well, whatever it was
to be called,

336
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,332
the design was applauded

337
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,165
by the powers-that-be
here at Britannia.

338
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,432
Alfred Baker was once
your apprentice, was he not?

339
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:10,965
And I taught him well.

340
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,699
Hm.

341
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,066
But to have your junior
surpass you...

342
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,833
Must have been
difficult.

343
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,232
Competition can be a good thing.

344
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,665
Mm, da Vinci and Michelangelo.

345
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,199
Uh, Ingres and Delacroix.

346
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,199
Well, Mr. Bracewell
said his designs

347
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,999
were going to change
the world.

348
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,299
But now he and his telephone
are gone,

349
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,833
so the road is clear for you,
Mr. Archer.

350
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:37,832
Mm.

351
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,899
I have work to do.

352
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,832
Can you tell us where you were
on the day of the explosion?

353
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,765
Here, working
on my design.

354
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:46,999
Hm, did anyone else see you?

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,699
You are not
the police,

356
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,065
and I'm not obliged
to talk to you.

357
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:55,732
And would you please
stop touching my things?!

358
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,365
Well, we now know
he has a temper.

359
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:04,765
First rule of being
a private investigator--

360
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:09,865
deliberately vex the suspect
to test their temperament.

361
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:11,332
Patrick,

362
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,465
I think I can
just about take you

363
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:13,832
advising me
on my business skills,

364
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,599
but do not presume
to lecture me on deduction.

365
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,432
There's an article in here

366
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:20,232
about Britannia's
current telephone.

367
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,065
Apparently, there are
three main issues:

368
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,332
cost, sound quality,
and a tendency to short-circuit.

369
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,299
No wonder Bracewell was
so desperate for a new model.

370
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,799
Clarence did some digging

371
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,399
on Bracewell's partner,
George Davidson.

372
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,932
And?

373
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,599
He has no family,
no close relations,

374
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,632
no financial issues
or known grudges.

375
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,365
Well, apart from the one

376
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,932
held by his business partner,
Joseph Bracewell.

377
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,865
Forget the client.

378
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:44,499
We need to concentrate
on Daniel Archer.

379
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,099
He has a clear motive,
he wanted to remove his rival.

380
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,799
And he has no alibi--
he should be our prime suspect.

381
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,865
Delivery from your friend
at the Met.

382
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,466
Thank you.

383
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,932
Hm, these are good.

384
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,632
They're very good.

385
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,066
The crime scene?
Yeah.

386
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,199
How peculiar.

387
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,099
What?

388
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,865
That looks like the scorch mark
from where

389
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:12,999
the gas was ignited.

390
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,732
So?

391
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:18,099
Well, if, as the police suspect,
it was Davidson's pipe

392
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,665
that ignited the gas,

393
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,365
why is the scorch mark
on the opposite side

394
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:22,799
of the room from the bodies?

395
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,599
Hurry up, you useless vermin!

396
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,865
We haven't got all day!

397
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,965
Good morning, Detective Phelps.

398
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:40,799
Yeah, it was,
before you turned up.

399
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,032
We wondered
if the Britannia explosion

400
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,965
had been assessed yet
by your fire expert.

401
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:49,232
They're now stuck with a factory
blaze in bloody St. Albans.

402
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:51,132
Get a move on!

403
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,899
Dare I say it,
Detective Phelps,

404
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,465
you seem
a little overstretched.

405
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,932
That's one word for it.

406
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,599
Let us lighten your load.

407
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,533
We can help
with the Britannia case.

408
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,965
I don't need your help.

409
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:03,266
And let you take
all the credit.

410
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,032
Ten minutes at the crime scene.

411
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:15,433
That's all you're getting.

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,966
Good, aren't I?

413
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,432
Something in this area
must have caused the spark.

414
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:58,366
Someone has cut the insulation
off these wires.

415
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,833
Why would they do that?

416
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,899
Prone to short-circuit
when connected.

417
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,200
It's one of the known faults
of the Britannia telephone.

418
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,132
That's what ignited the gas,
Patrick.

419
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,966
It wasn't Davidson's pipe.

420
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,866
It was a phone call.

421
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:34,665
Which means whoever made
that call is our murderer.

422
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:43,399
2,512 telephones in operation
in London.

423
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,732
How do you know
these things?

424
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,199
I do research, Patrick--
you should try it sometime.

425
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,899
The question is:
from which telephone

426
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,165
was the fatal call made?

427
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,399
I understand the telephone
exchange log all call details,

428
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,632
so customers can
be charged accordingly.

429
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,899
So they might be able
to help us narrow it down.

430
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,132
It's worth a try.
Mm.

431
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,399
Provided we can persuade them
to show us their call log.

432
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,365
I suspect all calls

433
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,600
are treated confidentially,
and we don't have a warrant.

434
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,699
Inspector Bates, Scotland Yard,
at your service, madam.

435
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,932
Are there any other officers
available?

436
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:20,932
Inspector Bates has
an excellent track record.

437
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,932
Well, he definitely works best
alone.

438
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:26,399
So, while he visits
the exchange,

439
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,865
I'll continue my research
into the telephone.
Mm.

440
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,899
See if I can glean
any further insight

441
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,466
into Alfred Baker's
new design.

442
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:42,932
What?

443
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,399
I much prefer it
when you're not sulking.

444
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,666
I don't sulk-- I brood.

445
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:55,399
I know we've been at odds
over the hiring of staff,

446
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,733
but you've not been yourself
lately.

447
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,299
Is it the inspector?

448
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,899
The fact that he's gone?

449
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,765
Inspector Bates is waiting.

450
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,565
Yes, madam.

451
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:45,065
Can I help you? Of course.

452
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:59,265
Good afternoon,
which number do you require?

453
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:02,366
Certainly, sir--
please hold.

454
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,299
Mr. Underwood?

455
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,465
Yes?

456
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:24,432
Inspector Bates,
Scotland Yard.

457
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:25,965
How do you do, Inspector?

458
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:29,732
This is quite the operation
you got here.

459
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,965
Never seen one of those
before.

460
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,399
Uh, they allow me
to listen in.

461
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,399
Ensure that my operators
are performing at their best.
Hm.

462
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,432
How may I help you,
Inspector?

463
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:42,499
I'm investigating
the Britannia murders.

464
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,065
You read about them?

465
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:46,765
I have--
terrible business.

466
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:50,332
We need to identify the source
of a particular telephone call,

467
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,999
so I'd be grateful
to look at your call log

468
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,365
for the day in question,
the 21st of September.

469
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:58,332
Yes, Inspector, one moment,
I'll just fetch the logbook.

470
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,932
One moment.

471
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,666
Sorry, Inspector.

472
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,999
It just occurred to me,
I, uh...

473
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,132
Well, I should really see
your warrant first.

474
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,033
My warrant?

475
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:15,232
As you can appreciate,
all our calls are confidential.

476
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:19,832
It's more than my job's worth,
uh, to break protocol.

477
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,533
Unless, of course,
you have a warrant.

478
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:27,165
All right, fine, I'm not
an inspector from Scotland Yard.

479
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,699
But if you allow me
to see the call log,

480
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,665
I'll make it worth your while.

481
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,365
If you're not a policeman,
then what the hell are you?

482
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,300
I am a private detective.

483
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,599
A what?

484
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,899
And don't even think
about coming back again!

485
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,166
You're lucky I'm not
reporting you to the police!

486
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,366
A copy of Alfred Baker's
contract with Britannia.

487
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,932
Oh, um...

488
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,065
Oh, shall I...
Uh, yes.

489
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:12,932
Yep, got it, got it.

490
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,400
Thank you.

491
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Have you read this, Clarence?
Yeah, briefly.

492
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,499
George Davidson
and Joseph Bracewell

493
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,165
were each going to receive
45% of the profits

494
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,399
from this new telephone.

495
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,899
While Mr. Baker,
the genius that invented it,

496
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,432
just got ten percent.

497
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,999
Uh, my contact
at Britannia

498
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,599
insisted on a bottle
of Lynch-Bages '64

499
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,665
in exchange for that contract,

500
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,865
so, I, I will, of course,
be charging that to the company?

501
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,032
Oh, just charge it
to Mr. Nash.

502
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:43,932
"Upon death,

503
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,632
"an individual's share
of profits

504
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:49,132
will be distributed equally
among surviving parties."

505
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,599
You know what this means?

506
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,332
No doubt I will end up paying
for that bottle of wine myself.

507
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,999
No, it means
that Joseph Bracewell is now

508
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,500
entitled to all the profits
from Alfred Baker's telephone.

509
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,365
Oh, I'm...

510
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:04,599
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Miss Scarlet.

511
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,599
What is it, Betty?

512
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,765
I came back from visiting
Alfred's mother.

513
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:12,265
Poor woman's in such a state.

514
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,765
And as I walked in, I heard
someone going out the back door.

515
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:17,732
Terrified, I was.

516
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:20,432
But when I went to check,
whoever it was had already gone.

517
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,732
I did contact the police,
but...

518
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,732
They still haven't come.

519
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,265
They're a little overstretched
at the moment,

520
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,233
but you did the right thing
coming to me.

521
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:36,332
And are you sure
that nothing's missing?

522
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,699
Nothing that I can see.

523
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,865
They didn't touch
my jewelry case.

524
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,265
Not that I've got much.

525
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:45,332
Have you rearranged
these at all?

526
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,932
That was Alfred's favorite set
of books.

527
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:52,766
Where's volume two?

528
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,165
It was
definitely there before.

529
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:14,165
Inspector Bates,
I presume?

530
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,199
I hear Inspector Bates
was thwarted,

531
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,665
so you resorted to plan B.
Mm.

532
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,565
I went through all my files
twice

533
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:22,632
to see if I knew anyone else
who worked here.

534
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,832
So I hear-- you left the office
in quite a mess.

535
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:27,099
Clarence was not happy.

536
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,399
So you found someone.

537
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,532
Mm, the night shift manager,
an Elmer Goodheart.

538
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,232
Not that there's anything
good about him.

539
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:34,632
A few years back,
I put him away for fraud.

540
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,265
His shift starts at 8:00.

541
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:40,332
And Clarence said
Miss Baker had a break-in.

542
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,665
What was taken?

543
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,365
The only thing missing
was a book.

544
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:46,899
"Inventions That Changed
the World," volume two.

545
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,632
And that's it?

546
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,565
Yes.

547
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:52,499
But I have a theory.

548
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,632
Oh, good.

549
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:54,965
I like when you say that.

550
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:56,465
It makes me feel warm inside.

551
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,399
Have you finished?

552
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,332
Yes.

553
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,899
I think the book contained
the plans

554
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,632
for Alfred's
new telephone design.

555
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:07,465
The ones that
Daniel Archer was after.

556
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:08,699
Well, there he is.

557
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,665
Elmer Goodheart.

558
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:15,565
Sure he's going
to be delighted to see me.

559
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:24,899
That's the supervisor
I spoke to, Mr. Underwood.

560
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,965
Mr. Underwood.
Hi, Charles--
thank you.

561
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:39,432
He's only a manager, and yet
he can afford his own carriage?

562
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:49,465
Striking, isn't it?

563
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:51,565
It certainly is.

564
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,165
The 21st of September.

565
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,499
Appreciate your assistance,
Mr. Goodheart.

566
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:08,765
Handwriting is incredibly
neat.
Mm.

567
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:12,099
The explosion happened
at 36 minutes past two.

568
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,499
Here.

569
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,132
A call was made to the
Britannia engineering workshop

570
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:19,365
from the...

571
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,699
Britannia Telephone Company.

572
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,065
Office of J. Bracewell.

573
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:28,199
Damn it.

574
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:37,032
On no account can we speak
to Mr. Bracewell about this.

575
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:40,132
Of course,
we speak to him, Patrick.

576
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,499
He's our prime suspect.

577
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,299
He's also a client,
and a well-paying one at that.

578
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,999
No.

579
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,699
We keep our sights
on Daniel Archer.

580
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,599
Joseph Bracewell benefits
financially from the two deaths.

581
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,765
He's admitted to being
in his office

582
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:55,499
with his telephone
at the time of the explosion.

583
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,599
And both you and I agree that
whoever made that phone call

584
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,565
was almost certainly
the murderer.

585
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:01,199
If we accuse Bracewell
of murder,

586
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,332
he will fire us
and we'll lose our fee.

587
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,499
But we'll be doing our jobs.

588
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,865
No, your job is to do

589
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:07,332
what's best for my business,
and I'm ordering you

590
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,465
to say nothing
to Bracewell.

591
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,665
Ordering me?!

592
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:13,099
Yes! We stay on Archer!

593
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,232
It's laughable.

594
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:27,499
He constantly corrects me
and tells me how to behave,

595
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,199
and yet what he's doing
is completely immoral.

596
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,499
I've never met anyone
so bloody-minded and pigheaded.

597
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,599
And before you say anything, no,
I'm not either of those things,

598
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,265
so, I'll thank you to
keep your opinions to yourself.

599
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:37,665
I didn't say anything.

600
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,899
You didn't have to.

601
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,199
Inspector Wellington
wrote to me again.

602
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,265
He wants to know
if you're upset with him.

603
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:47,532
Why is he asking you?

604
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,565
Well, he tried asking you,
and got no response.

605
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:55,499
Lizzie, no matter what you say,
I know that you're angry.

606
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,565
When you were a little girl...

607
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:58,799
I do not need a story

608
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,799
from my childhood
cleverly designed to teach me

609
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,099
a life lesson as an adult.

610
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,899
You have no idea
what the story was going to be.

611
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,599
It was going to be
about the dog, wasn't it?

612
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,365
Fine.

613
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:10,766
You know so much, you can
sort things out for yourself.

614
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,499
Nothing to sort out.

615
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,199
Inspector Wellington has left,
and when he returns,

616
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,599
we shall talk,
and in the meantime,

617
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,165
I have no intention
of replying to his letters.

618
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,365
Because you're angry
with him.

619
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,465
Fine!

620
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:27,365
I am angry!

621
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:28,499
He shouldn't have left!

622
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,099
He should have stayed
and we could have...

623
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,932
Could have what?

624
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:35,165
I don't know.

625
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,233
And there's your answer.

626
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,799
What is?

627
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,199
The reason why he left.

628
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,765
He went away for your sake,
as well as his,

629
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:49,399
so you both could have had time
to work out

630
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,600
what it is you really want.

631
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:54,299
He's a good man, Lizzie.

632
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,765
He doesn't deserve you
ignoring him like this.

633
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:59,765
Oh, so all the fault
lies with me, does it?

634
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:00,932
Thank you for your loyalty.

635
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:02,299
Lizzie...
I've fed up with you,

636
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,465
Patrick Nash, and everyone else
pointing out my faults,

637
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:05,765
and telling me how to behave
that I,

638
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,132
as though
I'm completely incapable

639
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:11,465
of making my own decisions!

640
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,965
Of course, Mr. Bracewell.

641
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,200
Mr. Bracewell will see you now.

642
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:48,765
Do you often accuse your client
of murder?

643
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:51,499
I'm not accusing you,
Mr. Bracewell.

644
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,699
I'm just looking
at the evidence,

645
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,799
and it is compelling.

646
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,932
You stood to gain all profits
from the new telephone

647
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,932
on the death of Mr. Davidson
and Mr. Baker.

648
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:06,232
Well, I'm the bearer
of bad news.

649
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:10,965
Because if that call came
from this telephone,

650
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:14,232
then it couldn't have been me
who made it.

651
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:18,699
Because I was in Ealing.

652
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,499
Ealing?

653
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,199
It was at the
United Telephone Company.

654
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,565
I've been involved in secret
negotiations to buy them out.

655
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:27,832
Then why not tell myself
and Mr. Nash that

656
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,665
in the first place?

657
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,532
Because it's
a highly competitive industry,

658
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:33,399
and I didn't want
to harm the deal.

659
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,032
It's not yet been sealed.

660
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,632
Perhaps you could
also explain

661
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,232
how I can profit
from a telephone

662
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:40,865
that no longer exists.

663
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:44,499
Mr. Baker made a copy
of his plans,

664
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,632
which I'm sure
you well know.

665
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,300
I did not know.

666
00:35:55,933 --> 00:36:00,665
Here's how this is
going to work, Miss Scarlet.

667
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:04,365
You will bring me
Alfred Baker's plans

668
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,465
immediately.

669
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:08,065
If you do not,

670
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:12,132
I will let Mr. Nash know
I'm firing his agency.

671
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,100
Where have you been?

672
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:32,532
Ealing.

673
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,532
Well, while you've been
gone,

674
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:40,266
we received this telegram
from Mr. Bracewell.

675
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:44,932
He advises, albeit politely,

676
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,733
that we're fired.

677
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:52,065
How dare you disregard
my instructions.

678
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,132
You gave me no choice.

679
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:55,632
I was doing my job.

680
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:58,100
Your job is to build this
business, not lose us clients.

681
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,465
What the hell
is in Ealing, anyway?

682
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:05,865
Um, well, I was checking
on Mr. Bracewell's new alibi.

683
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:07,165
And?

684
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,999
It stands up.

685
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,599
Where are you going?

686
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,899
To try and persuade Bracewell
to reconsider.

687
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,699
If you are to run this agency,
you must first and foremost

688
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,099
be a businesswoman.

689
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,099
And I'll not be
returning to Paris

690
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,499
until you convince me
you understand this.

691
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,099
Oh, Mr. Nash...

692
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,465
Mr. Nash!

693
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:29,465
Miss Scarlet.

694
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:30,865
Not now, Clarence.

695
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:32,932
I have just had word
from my source at the bank.

696
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,465
He informs me that
Daniel Archer has been making

697
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,899
regular cash withdrawals
over the last six months.

698
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,099
I said not now,
Clarence.

699
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,365
Yes, but just
one more thing.

700
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:43,099
Mr. Archer took out
a large sum of cash

701
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,766
from his bank account
not one hour ago.

702
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:32,433
Pleasure doing business
with you.

703
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:50,165
What on Earth...?

704
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,565
I found this in your drawer,
Mr. Archer.

705
00:38:52,566 --> 00:38:55,732
It's Alfred Baker's
favorite book, I gather.

706
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,899
And one which was stolen
from his bookcase.

707
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,732
As I suspected,

708
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:04,632
this is where Alfred
hid the plans

709
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,165
for his new telephone.

710
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,532
You want to make
Alfred Baker's design

711
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:09,932
and pass it off as your own.

712
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:13,099
Alfred could never have
designed that telephone

713
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,065
without my tutelage, so...

714
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:17,566
Why should it be that
he gets all the credit?

715
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,832
I just witnessed you
giving Mr. Underwood something.

716
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,132
Money, I suspect.

717
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:27,832
Show me the contents
of that envelope he gave you,

718
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,065
and perhaps I won't report you
to the police.

719
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:52,265
This is Pitman shorthand.

720
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,933
My father made me study it.

721
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,833
It's transcripts
from phone calls.

722
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:06,499
But all involving Alfred Baker

723
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,600
in conversation with his boss,
George Davidson.

724
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:15,499
This is how you knew where
he hid his plans, isn't it?

725
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,465
And to pass yourself off
as the inventor

726
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:19,899
of his telephone,
you needed him dead.

727
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,332
That's not true.

728
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:26,599
And you have absolutely no proof
that it was me.

729
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:51,332
Well, the good news is, we've
managed to calm Bracewell down.

730
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,332
To do so,

731
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,732
I had to paint you as,
well...

732
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,999
Let me guess--
insubordinate.

733
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,365
On second thought,
it's perhaps best I do not

734
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:00,799
share with you the exact words
I used to describe you.

735
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,899
You were right.

736
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,899
Of course, I was.

737
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,399
About what?

738
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,365
Daniel Archer.

739
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:10,032
Now we just have to prove
that he's the murderer.

740
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:21,565
I thought I told you to leave.

741
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:24,700
And now I see
you've brought your wife.

742
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:30,366
I'm not his wife.

743
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,132
We know you're being paid

744
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,599
by people like Archer
to transcribe the conversations

745
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,499
of private telephone calls.

746
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,899
A call was made
to the Britannia workshop

747
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,565
on the 21st of September.

748
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,332
It caused the explosion
there.

749
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,800
Did Daniel Archer
make that call?

750
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,365
Um, I don't know.

751
00:41:51,366 --> 00:41:53,365
Look, I don't know anything,
I swear it.

752
00:41:53,366 --> 00:41:55,365
Do these belong to you?

753
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:57,399
Yes, but they're just timesheets

754
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,632
for the girls.

755
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,299
It's not the contents
that interest me,

756
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,132
Mr. Underwood,
but rather the,

757
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,565
the neatness of
the handwriting.

758
00:42:03,566 --> 00:42:05,965
We'd like to take
another look at the logbook

759
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,300
for the 21st of September.

760
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,699
The other days are varied
with different handwriting.

761
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,532
Various operators, I assume.

762
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:20,965
The day of the murder has been
filled entirely by one person.

763
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:23,466
You, Mr. Underwood.

764
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:27,033
Why?

765
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:30,732
I was told to.

766
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,199
When this blackmail letter

767
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,799
was delivered to me

768
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,932
on the night of that explosion,

769
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:44,099
threatening to expose me.

770
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,399
It's ordering you
to amend the details of the call

771
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,132
made to the Britannia workshop

772
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,799
to say that it came
from Joseph Bracewell's office.

773
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,032
In order to do that,

774
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:57,032
I had to replace the whole page
in the logbook

775
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,599
and fill in
the entire day myself.

776
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,299
So where did the call
really come from?

777
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,599
From a public telephone
in Farringdon.

778
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:18,999
Whoever wrote that blackmail
note must be our murderer.

779
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,132
They clearly knew
about his sideline.

780
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,332
Maybe it's someone
who works here.

781
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,099
My thoughts exactly.

782
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,865
I'll go back in and
compare the handwriting

783
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:30,899
of the blackmail letter
against the call log.

784
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,532
While you do that,
I'll go to Farringdon.

785
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:33,899
With any luck, whoever runs

786
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,333
the public phones there
will keep records.

787
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:43,299
"A talented detective
with the utmost integrity."

788
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,799
What?

789
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,499
They were the words I used
to describe you to Bracewell.

790
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:12,932
We don't keep records
of calls made.

791
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:15,065
How often is
this telephone used?

792
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,699
Not much.

793
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,699
People around here,

794
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,332
they don't really
understand it.

795
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,765
Hm.

796
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:24,265
You had a customer here
three days ago, on the 21st.

797
00:44:24,266 --> 00:44:26,165
Early afternoon?

798
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,665
Mm-- do you remember
the person?

799
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,100
Absolutely.

800
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,765
Got you.

801
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,765
B.L.

802
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:01,365
It's the same handwriting
as the blackmail letter.

803
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,032
B.L.

804
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,299
Elizabeth Landing.

805
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,532
She was an operator here
until about six months ago.

806
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,199
Left to get married.

807
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,632
Ooh.

808
00:45:12,633 --> 00:45:14,432
Are you suggesting
that she was the one

809
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:15,632
that wrote me the letter?

810
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:16,765
Almost certainly.

811
00:45:16,766 --> 00:45:18,999
Who is she?

812
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,965
Her fiancé worked
at Britannia.

813
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:24,632
Why has she signed her name
B and not E?

814
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,099
Because she called herself
Betty.

815
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:42,465
You wanted Davidson
and Bracewell dead.

816
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:46,932
But Alfred,
that was an accident,

817
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:50,132
wasn't it?

818
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:54,332
Alfred was never meant
to be at that meeting.

819
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,532
But his boss must have
called him in last minute.

820
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:58,832
I had no idea.

821
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:01,965
You stole the keys

822
00:46:01,966 --> 00:46:04,699
to Alfred's workshop,

823
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,632
you primed the telephone
to spark,

824
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:10,132
punctured the gas pipe,
and left.

825
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,132
Knowing that
by the afternoon,

826
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:13,532
when Bracewell
and Davidson came

827
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:17,132
for their meeting,
the workshop would be a bomb,

828
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:19,532
ready to explode.

829
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:22,066
And then you made the call.

830
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:26,899
Ten percent!

831
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,399
That's all they gave him.

832
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,065
Ten percent for all the time
and all the work he put in.

833
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:34,965
I just wanted Alfred
to have what he deserved.

834
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,500
It was so unfair.

835
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,032
Do what you want with me.

836
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,865
My life's over now, anyway.

837
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:49,265
I killed my husband.

838
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:53,665
My own beloved husband.

839
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,099
I said get in there,
you toe-rag!

840
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,465
Get in there!

841
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:04,765
You bloody idiot!

842
00:47:04,766 --> 00:47:06,399
I don't think I can do this.

843
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,965
We gave Phelps our word.

844
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:12,032
If we give Phelps the credit,
it could seal his promotion.

845
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:14,265
Is that really what we want,
to be dealing with him?

846
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:15,832
It'll be you dealing with him.

847
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,400
So you need to give him the win.

848
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,899
Detective Phelps.

849
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,165
Miss Scarlet.

850
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,699
Have you got something
for me?

851
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,432
The evidence is all in here.

852
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:41,899
And just remind me

853
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,532
who solved this case.

854
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,932
You did, Detective Phelps.

855
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:50,099
And did I get any help?

856
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,265
At all?

857
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:53,399
No, Detective Phelps.

858
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:58,599
That's the right answer.

859
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,032
What's going on?

860
00:48:24,033 --> 00:48:26,865
Oh, I contacted
the applicants you favored.

861
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:30,732
They're here for
the interview.

862
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,699
Well, where are you going?

863
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,299
They'll be working for you.

864
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,099
You should be the one
to choose your staff.

865
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,865
Let's just call it
a show of faith.

866
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,499
Thank you, Patrick.

867
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,499
Oh.

868
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,032
I had that installed.

869
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:50,465
I thought it might
be helpful.

870
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:52,899
What, to keep checks on me
when you return to Paris?

871
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,699
Why must you always
think the worst of me?

872
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,832
I am simply a man at
the forefront of innovation.

873
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,765
Well, it's no matter.

874
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:01,765
The technology is
still far off being able

875
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:03,199
to place a call overseas.

876
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,199
But as a man at
the forefront of innovation,

877
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,866
you, of course, knew that.

878
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:11,166
Of course, I did.

879
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,732
What are you doing?

880
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,766
Helping.

881
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:55,032
So...

882
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:58,132
Are you still angry
with me?

883
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,032
Are you still angry
with me?

884
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:01,032
I asked first.

885
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:11,199
Oh, sorry.

886
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,032
I shouldn't have gone
behind your back like that.

887
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:14,032
I just thought

888
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,199
I was doing the right thing.

889
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,565
I know, and I understand
why you did it.

890
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:20,065
And you're right.

891
00:50:20,066 --> 00:50:21,932
This, Inspector Wellington
leaving

892
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:25,499
has caused me some... upset.

893
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,099
And you miss him.

894
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,365
I'm only saying this
because I love you,

895
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:35,566
but I think replying to him
would make you feel better.

896
00:50:37,966 --> 00:50:39,565
And I think you're right.

897
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:42,465
Oh, you're always right.

898
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:44,500
I keep saying that to Barnabus,
but will he listen?

899
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:49,833
Ivy, I hate cauliflower.

900
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:55,965
You'll eat what I cook for you,
young lady.

901
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,299
Good evening.

902
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,899
My name is Miss Scarlet.

903
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,832
I believe you are...

904
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:21,665
An associate of my father's.

905
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:25,232
He said there'd be food.

906
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:29,199
Yes, I cooked a smoked ham
this afternoon.

907
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,399
I'll cut you a slice.

908
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:49,632
Dear William,

909
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:52,832
I'm happy to hear
things are going well

910
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:56,832
for you in New York.

911
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,299
It's been
an interesting week here.

912
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,265
But, on balance, a good one.

913
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,065
Mr. Nash is wanted
in connection with a murder.

914
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,332
I have a warrant for his arrest.

915
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:22,465
He was looking for someone

916
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:23,465
right before they were killed,

917
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:24,532
and then he disappeared.

918
00:52:24,533 --> 00:52:25,699
Leave this alone.

919
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,232
How can I
when you fled a murder scene?

920
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:28,399
I don't have time to explain.

921
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,865
What have you done, Patrick?
