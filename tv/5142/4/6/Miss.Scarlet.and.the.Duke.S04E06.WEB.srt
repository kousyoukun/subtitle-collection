1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,099
I'm going to New York.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,365
For a year?

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,399
This isn't goodbye--
it's goodbye for now.

4
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,199
You're taking over
from Inspector Wellington?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,732
Just needs to be rubber-stamped.

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,165
If we give Phelps the credit,

7
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,199
it could seal his promotion.

8
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,399
If you are to run this agency,

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,765
you must, first and foremost,
be a businesswoman.

10
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,665
I will not be returning to Paris
until you convince me

11
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,999
you understand this.

12
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,699
It's not my fault!

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,932
All this is your fault!

14
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,099
Fine, it's my fault!

15
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:02,599
Are you sure
this is the way out?

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,999
Not remotely.

17
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,665
I thought you said
you'd been here before.

18
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,332
No, I said I'd ridden
past it in a carriage.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,065
What is this place?

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,099
A good place for
a wanted man to hide.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,665
What is this powder?

22
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,899
It's everywhere.
They used to make some kind

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,299
of chemical here,
I can't remember what.

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,565
Is it toxic?

25
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,000
That may be the least
of our worries.

26
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm fairly sure we lost him.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Really? I'm not.

28
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,232
Neither am I.

29
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,533
Will that lock
from the inside?

30
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:00,765
I thought you'd drugged him.

31
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:03,099
I did, but he's rather large.

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,233
It may take some time
to have an effect.

33
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,999
Clothing, that was it.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,799
They used to dye
clothes here.

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,332
There's an interesting
story about that...

36
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:17,765
You're absolutely sure

37
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:18,832
you gave him
that laudanum?

38
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,065
How many times?
Yes, I'm sure.

39
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,365
Eliza!

40
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,799
It's not an exact science--
I didn't want to kill him.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,732
Don't worry.

42
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,665
I used to box
for County Wicklow.

43
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,099
Well, is that
a high standard, or...

44
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,932
Yes, it's a high standard!

45
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,465
Good work.

46
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,565
Thank you, gentlemen, thank you.

47
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:51,299
But we must also thank Mr. Nash.

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,065
He and I apprehended
the fugitive together.

49
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,699
That said, we only found him

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,465
thanks to your hard work.

51
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:00,465
And, not only is this

52
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,865
the highest-paid case we've had

53
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:06,532
since I took charge, but it is
also the highest-profile.

54
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,932
As such, I am pleased to say
that even more new clients

55
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,532
have engaged our services.

56
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,799
This, in addition
to the other cases

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,399
we're currently working,
will mean

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,199
longer days and longer hours,
but it will also mean overtime.

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,232
Oh.

60
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,365
We're going to be busier

61
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,599
than ever, gentlemen.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,865
Thank you once again.

63
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,099
All of you.

64
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,265
- Well done, Miss Scarlet.
- Well done!

65
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,765
It's been our
strongest quarter yet.

66
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,699
Eight payments
of completion,

67
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,365
six engagements
of service,

68
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,532
and that's not
including the three

69
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,699
that came in this morning.

70
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,132
The men you've hired
are working well.

71
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:44,599
Yeah, are the overtime payments
strictly necessary?

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,665
Well, it's good
for morale.

73
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,099
And you did say
that we could afford it.

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,632
We can, just.

75
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,399
He was never this generous
with me.

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,865
I believe you've cured
our Mr. Scrooge.

77
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,232
Or perhaps you were visited

78
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,532
by the ghosts of
three dead accountants.

79
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,965
Ho-ho.

80
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,099
Any other business?

81
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,599
Yes.

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,999
I've decided to return to Paris

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,966
at the end of the week.

84
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,232
Well, you will, of course,
be missed, Patrick,

85
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,000
but I appreciate
the show of faith.

86
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,832
I'll make your
travel arrangements.

87
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,500
I assume it must be
first-class, as-- correct.
You assume correctly.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,333
You look tired.

89
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,865
Thank you for that.
I'm not surprised.

90
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,265
You've been working
seven days a week

91
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,365
for the last couple of months.

92
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,932
You need to take
the afternoon off.

93
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,132
I have too much work.

94
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,399
Nonsense.

95
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,465
You need some fun.

96
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,732
And I have just the ticket.

97
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,666
Get your things--
we're going to the races.

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,899
The races?

99
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,299
Horses--
if we leave now,

100
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,799
we'll get to Epsom
for the 2:00 steeplechase.

101
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,532
No-- I don't like gambling.

102
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:59,732
You are the most natural
gambler I've ever met.

103
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,065
And what's the point
in earning money

104
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,265
if you can't lose it?

105
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,532
So, it's a bad thing.

106
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,299
I didn't say it was a bad thing,

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,199
I just said it wasn't good.

108
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,865
Forgive the pedantry,

109
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,132
but what's the difference?

110
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,532
A bad thing is
when you know

111
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,965
for certain it's bad,
you have proof.

112
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,165
But if something is not good,
it means it might be bad,

113
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,565
but you don't know
for sure-- yet.

114
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,499
Right, that makes sense--
I think.

115
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,599
And with Duke gone for
the best part of two months now,

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,565
it's not good they haven't said
who's covering for him.

117
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:48,032
And the word is,
they're looking at someone

118
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,799
from outside the department
like that posh boy,

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,065
Hudson,
from the Irish Branch.

120
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,599
You don't think
it'll be Hudson, do you?

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,599
God knows-- all I know is,

122
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,299
they ain't given me the nod.

123
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,632
I knew I should've
joined the Masons.

124
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,699
Assault with a deadly weapon,
retrieval of stolen goods,

125
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,965
and failure to answer
a court summons.

126
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,532
And I don't know if you can
charge him with this,

127
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:09,632
but he smells like
a cesspit in summer.

128
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,765
You heard anything about
that skipper's job from Daddy?

129
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,265
I do wish people would cease
to ask me about my father.

130
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,665
No, he has not
spoken on it.

131
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,399
In truth, we rarely talk.

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,599
There you go, sir.

133
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,665
This Hudson thing is
probably just a rumor.

134
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,199
Well, rumor or not,
it's bloody frustrating.

135
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,532
Maybe they just
don't like you.

136
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,265
Shut your mouth, you--
come with me!

137
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,265
Oliver.

138
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:34,433
Father, I, I wasn't aware
you were coming in today.

139
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,666
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

140
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,733
Thank you.

141
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,499
You like this place?

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,065
Well, it's a little rough
around the edges, but I do.

143
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,732
We tend to come here
after a shift.

144
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:02,899
Well...

145
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,232
I'll make it brief.

146
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:09,265
While Inspector Wellington
is in New York,

147
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:13,432
we need a suitable candidate
to carry on his duties.

148
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,965
We are yet to find
said candidate.

149
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:18,265
Well, Detective Phelps
was just saying...

150
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,199
No, I said a
suitable candidate.

151
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,932
That does not mean Phelps.

152
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:25,499
But he acted up the last time
Inspector Wellington was away.

153
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,465
Oh, that was for a few days--
this is for a year.

154
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,332
Besides, the job
is political now.

155
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,699
Budget reviews, presentations
to the Home Office.

156
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,232
Can you imagine
a man like Phelps

157
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,732
dealing with government
ministers?

158
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,032
Mmm.

159
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:44,665
No, I want someone
who understands the game.

160
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,399
The right man
for the job.

161
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,732
We offered it to Hudson
in Irish Branch,

162
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,732
but he turned it down.

163
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,932
As did four--
no, five others.

164
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,032
No one wants it.

165
00:08:56,033 --> 00:09:01,499
This damned expansion has turned
the job into a poisoned chalice.

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,233
Which is why
I'm considering you.

167
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,299
Me?

168
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,165
We have not always seen
eye to eye.

169
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,332
And, in truth,
there have been times

170
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,532
when I would have gladly
set you adrift.

171
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,465
However, of late,

172
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,932
my opinion has begun to change.

173
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,932
Has it?

174
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,599
I've followed your progress.

175
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,299
It seems that you have
some aptitude

176
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,465
for detective work.

177
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:29,500
Thank you, Father.

178
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,332
You always lacked ambition,

179
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,232
even as a child.

180
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,765
Nevertheless, this could be
a golden opportunity for you,

181
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,465
and I urge you to seize it
with both hands.

182
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,299
I have given orders
that you are to lead

183
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,665
the next murder investigation
that comes in.

184
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,366
Show me you've got
what it takes.

185
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:54,999
We'll talk again.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,532
Yes, sir.

187
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,032
Thank you, sir.

188
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,866
Whoa.

189
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,132
Well, I call it beginner's luck.

190
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,765
It wasn't luck.

191
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,732
I read today's copy of "Sporting
Life" and studied the form.

192
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,132
Racing is about gut instinct
and spontaneity.

193
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,699
Where's the fun
in studying the form?

194
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,365
Oh, I think it's
right here.

195
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,532
Miss Scarlet,

196
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,499
Mr. Nash--
how was the racing?

197
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,132
Successful.

198
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,932
For some of us.

199
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,299
You know, nobody likes
a gloater.

200
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,333
Nobody likes a loser.

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,732
Right, well, um, this arrived
for you shortly after you left.

202
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:50,232
And the contracts have come
through for the Harrison case.

203
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,199
If you'd be so good
as to sign.

204
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,132
There are two copies:
here and here.

205
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,899
Everything all right,
Mr. Nash?

206
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,799
Just ignore him--
he's in a sulk.

207
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,265
And...

208
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,300
Patrick?

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,665
Heavenly Father,

210
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,532
bless these gifts,

211
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:23,065
which we receive
from thy bountiful goodness.

212
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:26,532
Deprive us not of thy kingdom,

213
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,865
but grant that we may feast
in fellowship with thee,

214
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:34,732
for now, and forevermore.

215
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,999
And we give thanks

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,465
for thy overflowing
generosity,

217
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,932
and endeavor to be truly worthy

218
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,632
of thy kindness.

219
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,965
Amen.

220
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,732
Amen.
Amen.

221
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,932
Apologies, Mr. Potts.

222
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,432
I'm a little out of practice
when it comes to saying grace.

223
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,565
Well, I've always believed

224
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:58,799
a simple blessing gives a
moment's pause after a long day.

225
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,432
Oh, that's so lovely, Barnabus.

226
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,399
You're so good with words.

227
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,432
Hmm, it's hard not to be
when you are my muse.

228
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:10,799
Um, have you heard from
Inspector Wellington recently?

229
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,065
Yes.

230
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,032
I received a letter from him
this morning.

231
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,632
He's moved into lodgings
near the police precinct

232
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,032
and seems to be
settling in well.

233
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,999
I plan to write back to him
after dinner.

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,432
Ooh! If you do...

235
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,399
I have a rather amusing anecdote

236
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,165
you might wish to include
in your correspondence.

237
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,699
About the methanol we received
at the mortuary.

238
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,965
You remember,
I told you about it?

239
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:35,332
Perhaps you can tell him
yourself on his return.

240
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,632
Oh, no, no, no.

241
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:37,999
A tale this hilarious
cannot wait.

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm not sure
I'd call it hilarious.

243
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:46,599
You said it was the funniest
story you'd ever heard.

244
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,399
It was how you told it
to me, Barnabus.

245
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,465
My fear is that Lizzie
may not do it justice

246
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:55,065
by writing it down.

247
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:57,999
I'll get that.

248
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,632
It was very funny.

249
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,165
Oh.

250
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,100
Detective Fitzroy.

251
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,365
To what do I owe this pleasure?
May I come in?

252
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,265
It is a somewhat
delicate matter.

253
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,300
Of course.

254
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,499
I'm looking for Mr. Nash, but
I've been unable to locate him.

255
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,032
I was hoping
he might be here?

256
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,765
I'm afraid not.

257
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,300
Is it something
I could help with?

258
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,032
There's been a murder.

259
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,265
The victim was stabbed
several times in a street

260
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:42,365
in Aldgate.

261
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:43,765
Oh.

262
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:46,265
Do you wish
to engage our services?

263
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:49,065
Mr. Nash is wanted in connection
with the murder.

264
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:52,699
I have a warrant
for his arrest.

265
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,232
What's she doing here?

266
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,332
I invited Miss Scarlet
to the scene.

267
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,765
She may be able
to shed some light

268
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,866
on the relationship
between the victim and Mr. Nash.

269
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:13,199
What did you say
his name was?

270
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,765
We're not entirely sure.

271
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,565
But we know he was in
a public house in the area.

272
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,299
The landlord only knew him
by his first name, Eamonn.

273
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,499
And what does this have
to do with Mr. Nash?

274
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,266
He was in the same pub,
asking about this Eamonn fella.

275
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,365
The landlord recognized Nash.

276
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,899
Apparently, he's a regular.

277
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,299
He was in what was described
as an agitated state.

278
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,265
A few minutes later, he was
seen stood over the body

279
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,300
before running off.

280
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,632
Defense wounds on the arms.

281
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:42,032
Several shallow cuts
to the torso.

282
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,932
It would appear
the fatal blow

283
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,732
was directly
through the heart.

284
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,432
Thank God you came,
Miss Scarlet.

285
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,332
We never would've
worked that out.

286
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,499
I've never seen

287
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,199
this man before.
Right, off you go, then.

288
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,199
Detective Phelps.

289
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,799
I would remind you

290
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,332
that I am the officer in
charge of this investigation.

291
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,699
Yeah?

292
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,833
And why is that, I wonder?

293
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,332
Orders from Daddy.

294
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,865
Has Mr. Nash

295
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:06,532
ever mentioned the name
Eamonn before?

296
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,999
Her boss is a suspect.

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,299
Talk about conflict
of interest.

298
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,365
Patrick Nash is many things,
but he's not a murderer.

299
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,199
Maybe not.

300
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,899
But he was looking for someone
right before they were killed,

301
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,365
and he was seen
by their dead body,

302
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,365
and then he disappeared.

303
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:20,699
He hasn't disappeared.

304
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,765
He's not at home,
he's not at work,

305
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,665
or any of his usual haunts.

306
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,065
So, where is he, then?

307
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,599
I asked the men.

308
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,799
No one's seen Mr. Nash

309
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,732
since he left the office
yesterday.

310
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,965
And this, uh, and the
telegram he received,

311
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:46,365
you didn't see what it said?
No.

312
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,765
It did seem to greatly
alter his mood.

313
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:51,799
Hmm, indeed, it did.

314
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,532
Ah.

315
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,765
The police have no surname
or address for the dead man.

316
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:59,432
They think his Christian name
is Eamonn?

317
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,499
Does that mean anything
to you?

318
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,765
That is a difficult question
to answer.

319
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,665
In what way?

320
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,632
Because you're my superior,
and I do not wish to lie to you.

321
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,199
Then don't.

322
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,965
Yes, but Mr. Nash owns
the company, and I,

323
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:13,766
I do not wish to betray
his confidence.

324
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,499
If he is charged with murder,

325
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,433
then we will both
be out of a job.

326
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,365
Well, when you put it that way.

327
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,865
As you know, we have a number
of paid informants on our books.

328
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,065
I make all
these payments myself,

329
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:34,332
with the exception of
a gentleman named Eamonn Murray.

330
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,665
What is he paid for?

331
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,965
Mr. Nash told me not to inquire,
in the most forceful terms.

332
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,499
Well, do you have an address
for him, at least?

333
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,166
As I say, Mr. Nash
told me not to inquire.

334
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,099
You're a cautious man, Clarence.

335
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,399
You trust no one with
the finances, not even Mr. Nash.

336
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,432
I find it hard to believe

337
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,599
that you haven't made it
your business

338
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,765
to find out who this man is.

339
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:03,132
I swear, I do not know
who he is.

340
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:07,032
But I may have once
paid a cab driver

341
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,765
to tell me where
he took Mr. Nash.

342
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,399
And as such, well,

343
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,265
I may have his address.

344
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,599
You've had a wasted journey,
Detective Fitzroy.

345
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,565
We are running most dreadfully
behind schedule,

346
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,832
and the postmortem has yet
to be carried out.

347
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,965
I was told you would have
the coroner's report by now.

348
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:32,565
I'm afraid Mr. Wormsley's
been called away

349
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:36,432
to the Stepney Mortuary
on a multiple drowning.

350
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,399
Things are still
in a state of flux.

351
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,432
We are understaffed
in many key areas,

352
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,299
including that of
forensic examination.

353
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,332
When will he be back?

354
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,865
Not for a number of hours.

355
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,965
I've checked
the records office

356
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:49,999
for Eamonn Murray,
he's got no previous.

357
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,299
Never even been arrested.

358
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,065
Anything from the postmortem?

359
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,099
They've not done it yet.

360
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:57,699
I was just explaining
to Detective Fitzroy

361
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,699
that there will be a delay
on the said report,

362
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,733
the fault of which
should not be laid at our door.

363
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,232
Perhaps you could have a word
with the police commissioner

364
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:09,099
about the disarray
Scotland Yard's expansion

365
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,365
has besieged upon us.

366
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,400
Why would I do that?

367
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:13,532
Well, he's your father,
after all.

368
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,065
Careful, Mr. Potts.

369
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,532
He don't like talking
about Daddy.

370
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,932
The fact he is my father
is quite separate

371
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,565
to my professional relationship
with him

372
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:21,899
as an officer of the law.

373
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,499
Really?

374
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,165
Now, there's a good one-- in
fact, it's quite cheered me up.

375
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,099
Apologies,
I meant no offense.

376
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,432
Detective Phelps, while we
wait for the said report,

377
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,099
I could give you
a few observations...
You will address me,

378
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,299
Mr. Potts, not Detective Phelps!

379
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,333
I am leading
this investigation.

380
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,165
Again, apologies.

381
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,832
Then I'll give you my opinion.

382
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,465
As far as I am aware,

383
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,299
you have no medical
qualifications, whatsoever.

384
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,499
You are, in fact, a clerk.

385
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,465
So, I would appreciate

386
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,465
if you kept your opinions
to yourself.

387
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:53,299
Let me know when this postmortem
has been carried out

388
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,400
immediately.

389
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,665
He's a sensitive soul.

390
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,066
Indeed.

391
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,665
Clarence.

392
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,533
I do this only because
I am concerned for Mr. Nash.

393
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,632
Do what?

394
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,699
Betray his confidence.

395
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,665
I've made further inquiries.

396
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,899
There is one other person
that Mr. Nash pays money to,

397
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,899
as with Eamonn Murray.

398
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,532
And that is?

399
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,900
I should not be doing this
voluntarily.

400
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,300
Perhaps if you could threaten me
in some way?

401
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,899
Very well.

402
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,499
Clarence,

403
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,232
I will dismiss you immediately

404
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,999
unless you give me the
information you've discovered.

405
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,866
That's very good.

406
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:56,232
Yeah, uh, once a month,
Mr. Nash makes a payment

407
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,833
to a lady named Margaret Farrel,
and that is all I know.

408
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,899
Apart from her address,
which you will now give me.

409
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,532
Good afternoon,
I, I wonder if you could help.

410
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,565
I'm looking for Margaret Farrel.

411
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,766
So am I, darling.

412
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,099
You're a private detective?

413
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,065
I am.

414
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:37,565
And your wife may be able to
help me locate a missing person.

415
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:38,799
Can I get you a drink?

416
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,833
No, thank you.

417
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:47,700
Will Mrs. Farrel be back soon?

418
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,600
I don't know
when she'll be back.

419
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,299
So, who is this missing person?

420
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,899
Uh, a business associate
of mine.

421
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,200
A Mr. Patrick Nash.

422
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,599
This makes sense now.

423
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,365
You know him?

424
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,165
I'm a fisherman.

425
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,132
Away on the boats
most of the time.

426
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,632
The nosey old cow next door
told me about someone

427
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:19,265
who comes and goes
when I'm not here.

428
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,866
Patrick something, she said.

429
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,432
So, that's the fella's name,
is it, Patrick Nash?

430
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:25,999
Mr. Farrel, please do not
jump to conclusions.

431
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,266
It's hard not to when he's
run off with me missus!

432
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,232
Sorry, darling.

433
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,632
It's not your fault.

434
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:42,965
It's just...

435
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:43,999
I just want her back.

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,965
I do understand,

437
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:48,100
and I, I know this is
difficult for you, but...

438
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:56,632
What?

439
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:57,765
You want some?

440
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,699
No, thank you.

441
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,132
The tin just looks familiar,
that's all.

442
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,166
A friend of mine
used the same brand.

443
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,999
Small world.

444
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,332
Well, hopefully, your wife
will be home soon.

445
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,565
If you'll excuse me,
I must be going.

446
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:19,499
If you find her,

447
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,699
you'll let me know,
won't you, darling?

448
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,332
Yes, of course.

449
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,166
As soon as you can.

450
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,499
Don't make me come looking
for you now.

451
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,599
Mr. Potts.

452
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,165
May I come in?

453
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,899
Miss Scarlet, I believe
we'd reached an understanding.

454
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,532
You may only enter
these premises

455
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,532
when accompanied
by an officer of the law.

456
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,632
I'm meeting Detective Fitzroy
about a case.

457
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:02,765
Eamonn Murray?

458
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:04,032
The stabbing
by the docks?

459
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:05,332
Yes, I know the case.

460
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,265
And no, Detective Fitzroy
has not arrived.

461
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,165
Nor has Mr. Wormsley
to do the postmortem.

462
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:13,365
I tried to explain
to Detective Fitzroy earlier

463
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:14,999
that we were rather under
the cosh at the moment,

464
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,432
but he was most rude to me.

465
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,865
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

466
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,365
but Detective Fitzroy
has instructed

467
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,132
that I wait for him inside.

468
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,432
Which I think still honors
the spirit of our agreement,

469
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:26,500
does it not?
No, it does not.

470
00:24:32,866 --> 00:24:34,165
Mr. Potts.

471
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,465
Ivy is like a mother to me,

472
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:38,399
and when the two of you are wed,

473
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,200
you will be, for better or
for worse, like a father.

474
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:45,365
And yet, you still
seek to lie, cheat,

475
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:48,299
and manipulate me, as ever.

476
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,266
Good day, Miss Scarlet!

477
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,699
That woman.

478
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,965
Utterly relentless.

479
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:58,132
Would try the patience
of a saint!

480
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,499
Mr. Potts, please.

481
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,899
Hear me out.

482
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,199
Miss Scarlet.

483
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,465
How on Earth did you...
The truth is,

484
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:07,999
I have no plans to meet
Detective Fitzroy.

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,632
Ah.

486
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,565
My business partner has gone
missing, accused of murder.

487
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,199
I'm convinced he's innocent,
but to prove it,

488
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,532
I need information on the corpse

489
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,565
you have in here,
and yes,

490
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,265
I know what we agreed.

491
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,165
And, yes, I know my presence
irks you so,

492
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,632
but right now, Mr. Potts,
beyond anyone else in the world,

493
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:25,065
it's your informed opinion
that I seek.

494
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,532
Oh.

495
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,765
Well, it's...

496
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:36,032
It's nice to know that someone
values my opinion, I suppose.

497
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,566
Hmm.

498
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:41,232
One question, you say?

499
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,399
Uh, the dead man's teeth--
what condition are they in?

500
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:55,600
Detective Fitzroy.

501
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,832
Miss Scarlet.

502
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,899
I'm sorry to bother you
so late.

503
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,299
I've a question for you.

504
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,532
Go on.

505
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,599
I went to the telegraph
office

506
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,599
near Eamonn Murray's
lodgings.

507
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,399
It appears he sent a telegram
to Mr. Nash saying, "He's back."

508
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,899
Do you know
what that could mean?

509
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,099
I don't, I'm afraid.

510
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,399
You look tired, Oliver.

511
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,632
Perhaps pick this up
in the morning.

512
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,432
It would be pointless--
I won't sleep.

513
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:24,399
I must make some progress
on this investigation.

514
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,799
My father's made it clear to me
that if I do well in this case,

515
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,165
then I'll be promoted,

516
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,099
and I'll fill
Inspector Wellington's shoes

517
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,399
while he's
on his secondment.

518
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,765
I see.

519
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,099
Please, keep this
to yourself.

520
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,565
Charlie Phelps has
his suspicions,

521
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,565
and I have enough on my plate
as it is.

522
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,799
He won't hear it from me.

523
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,799
And please, let me know
if Mr. Nash makes any contact

524
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,999
immediately.

525
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,733
Of course.

526
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:08,866
I got your message.

527
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,565
Your maid let me in.

528
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:13,732
Can she be trusted?

529
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,366
She can.

530
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,899
Patrick.

531
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,332
What's going on?

532
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,065
I can't stay long.

533
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:25,532
I come with only one request.

534
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:27,133
Leave this alone.

535
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,799
How can I when you fled
a murder scene?

536
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,332
I don't have time to explain,

537
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,533
but I need you to trust me
and do as I ask.

538
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:37,699
What did that telegram mean,
"He's back?" Who's back?

539
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,899
Eliza...

540
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,399
And where's Maggie Farrel?
Somewhere safe.

541
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,899
Safe from her husband?

542
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,399
She doesn't have a husband--
the man you met is dangerous.

543
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,799
Stay away from him.

544
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,365
How do you know who I met?

545
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:48,065
Have you been following me?
Run the business,

546
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,565
concentrate on the cases
you have.

547
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:52,100
Do not try to find me.

548
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:57,465
I found a brand
of chewing tobacco

549
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,133
at the dead man's lodgings.

550
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,132
And, as I'm sure you're aware,
chewing tobacco

551
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,265
often causes damage and decay
to the tooth and gums,

552
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,632
but Eamonn Murray's teeth
were in perfect condition,

553
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:08,965
not a stain on them.

554
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:12,332
I, I believe the tobacco
belonged to the Irish man

555
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,465
I met at Maggie Farrel's.
For your own safety,

556
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:16,599
stay out of this.

557
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,433
Please.

558
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,565
Chewing tobacco?

559
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:37,599
It's how we'll find him.

560
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,599
Who?

561
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,965
Bloody hell-- the murderer.

562
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,999
I am your senior officer.

563
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,765
You should not talk to me
in that kind of fashion.

564
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,132
What kind of fashion?

565
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:48,065
It's your tone, Charlie.

566
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,899
My tone? Oh, la-di-da!

567
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,966
Gentlemen.

568
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,565
Eamonn Murray was an informant
of Mr. Nash,

569
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:59,499
as is Maggie Farrel,
who is currently missing.

570
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,165
They are linked
by a third person.

571
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,365
The Irishman.
Finally, he gets it.

572
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,832
Someone matching
his description

573
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,365
was seen
at Eamonn Murray's lodgings

574
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:08,965
the day he was killed.

575
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,799
This is key.

576
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,799
It's a brand of chewing tobacco
from Norway,

577
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,532
sold in just one shop

578
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,265
in London:
a tobacconist near the docks.

579
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,399
The proprietor recently sold
several tins

580
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,499
to the crew of a fishing boat
from Oslo called the Narvik.

581
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,099
One of their number
was not Norwegian.

582
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,865
He was an Irishman
who bought three tins,

583
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:30,199
one of which I found
in Eamonn Murray's room.

584
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,499
I'll get down the docks, see
if can get the ship's manifest.

585
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,432
That should have the names
of everyone on board.
No.

586
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:38,066
You will wait
for my command.

587
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:44,032
No need,
Detective Phelps.

588
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,800
I went this morning
and got the manifest.

589
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,532
It's a crew of seven,
all with Norwegian names,

590
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,365
apart from

591
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:54,466
a Sean O'Driscoll.

592
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:59,432
Do you have any idea
where we might find him?

593
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:01,132
All my men have been looking
for him,

594
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,632
but so far found nothing.

595
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,365
My guess is that he'd be
somewhere near the docks.

596
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:07,699
There are three pubs
near where the ship's docked,

597
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,332
plus a couple
of low-rent brothels.

598
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,632
I imagine we'll find
one or two sailors there.

599
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:13,299
I was about to say the same.

600
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,599
Were you?

601
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,699
Detective Phelps,
gather ten men

602
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,200
and wait for us outside.

603
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:23,000
Now, Charlie!

604
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:41,465
Miss Scarlet, I, I apologize,
I just...

605
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,133
I just want this to go well.

606
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,332
Oliver, I'm far from an expert
on this,

607
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,365
but from my brief experience
of being the one in charge,

608
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:55,133
losing one's temper
rarely serves any purpose.

609
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:58,732
Inspector Wellington
always found a balance

610
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,665
between rebuke
and encouragement.

611
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,999
I confess, it does not
come naturally to me.

612
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,600
Well, you're not
Inspector Wellington.

613
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,232
You're your own person.

614
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:12,200
You'll find your own way.

615
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:21,999
Come on, get a move on!

616
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
Hurry up!

617
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:30,465
Any of these?

618
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,265
No, he's not here.

619
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,699
We're looking for a man
from a boat called the Narvik.

620
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,532
Norwegian in origin.

621
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:42,599
But the man we seek
is an Irishman

622
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,499
by the name of Sean O'Driscoll.

623
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,333
If any of you know him or any
of that crew, speak now.

624
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,732
This is a murder investigation.

625
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,932
If, if you do not cooperate,
there will,

626
00:31:57,933 --> 00:31:59,533
there will be consequences!

627
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,032
Any suggestions?

628
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:09,300
Oh, so you, uh,
want my help now?

629
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,532
My old man
was in the merchant navy.

630
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,899
30 years, man and boy.

631
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,265
I remember him saying most
sailors are only on dry land

632
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:25,099
for a couple of days
at a time.

633
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,232
The ship docks,
unloads its cargo,

634
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,732
loads up again, and heads off.

635
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,965
He was always worried
he'd pass out drunk somewhere,

636
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:34,265
and miss his ship leaving,

637
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,965
'cause then they'd give his job
to someone else.

638
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:40,999
And he'd be stranded miles
from home, no money,

639
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,199
and no job-- or even worse,
he'd be back in London,

640
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,932
and he'd have to go home
to me mum.

641
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,300
So...

642
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:52,765
We could have every one of you
held for questioning.

643
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:55,932
And that could mean days
in a cell, maybe longer.

644
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:59,165
Certainly long enough for
someone else to take your job.

645
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,999
Let's try this again.

646
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,399
Do any of you know
Sean O'Driscoll?

647
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,833
Were any of you on his boat?

648
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,865
You were on the Narvik?

649
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,632
No-- but he was.

650
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,565
Will you get out
of the bloody way, you idiot?!

651
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,666
Get up!

652
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,366
A thank you would be
appropriate.

653
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:59,099
Tell us about Sean O'Driscoll.

654
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,065
He was your shipmate?

655
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:06,132
When we arrived in London,

656
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,165
myself and the rest
of the crew

657
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,365
stayed in a boarding house
near the docks.

658
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:15,199
We assumed that Sean would go
home-- he said he lives here.

659
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,799
But instead, he stayed with us.

660
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,700
We shared a room together.

661
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,432
On the second night,
he came in late.

662
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:28,033
He was drunk and angry,
his clothes stained with blood.

663
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:31,265
He told me

664
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:33,799
if anyone came asking
that I had to say

665
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,865
I had been with him all night,
and to keep my mouth shut,

666
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:39,399
or he would kill me.

667
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,065
When was this?

668
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,065
Two nights ago.

669
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:45,366
The night of the murder.

670
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,599
Is he still at this
boarding house?

671
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,732
Keep those rounds secure.

672
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,265
Don't load
till I give the order.

673
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:56,065
And try not to bloody
shoot yourselves!

674
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:58,099
We couldn't find anything on
Sean O'Driscoll at first,

675
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,365
but I sent word to the records
office in Clerkenwell.

676
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,199
That's him.

677
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,065
It's an old charge sheet
from eight years ago.

678
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,599
It belongs to the
London City Police,

679
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,632
which is why we didn't have it
in our files.

680
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:09,099
There are numerous
petty offenses,

681
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,999
but there's something else.

682
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,499
Warrant for arrest, 1876.

683
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,365
He was a suspect
in a murder case,

684
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:19,499
but look
at the victim's name.

685
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,432
Michael Nash.

686
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,699
Patrick's brother.

687
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:47,832
Clarence, what do you know
of Mr. Nash's brother?

688
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:51,165
Only that he was murdered,
and the culprit never caught.

689
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,865
I need to show you something.

690
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,832
There's another safe
in my office.

691
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,532
Mr. Nash asked me not
to tell you, I really am...

692
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,032
Just tell me
what happened.

693
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:06,832
I was working late.

694
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,165
I stepped out for a few minutes
to get something to eat.

695
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:12,365
When I returned,
someone had accessed the safe.

696
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:14,999
How many hidden safes
does one man need?

697
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,766
He keeps his most
sensitive documents in there.

698
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,532
Only he and I know
of its existence,

699
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:22,099
which would seem to suggest...

700
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,566
He's been back here.

701
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,065
When you say "sensitive
documents," what do you mean?

702
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:30,432
Money in various different
currencies,

703
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:32,199
details of bank accounts
on the continent.

704
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,899
Things he would need

705
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,832
should he ever wish
to disappear.

706
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:38,732
Well, why would he wish
to disappear now?

707
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,232
Half of Scotland Yard
is looking for Sean O'Driscoll.

708
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:45,365
Perhaps he's fearful O'Driscoll
will get to him first?

709
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,833
Well, Patrick's no coward.

710
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, he has his moments.

711
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:54,232
Go and see if anything else
has been taken.

712
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,132
The men are in position.

713
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,799
We'll go in at exactly
11:00.

714
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,965
O'Driscoll's room
is on the second floor,

715
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,032
and it's possible he may try
to climb out the back, so...

716
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,365
Watch around the back,
yeah, I know.

717
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,133
I've got my men there
already.

718
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:24,299
My apologies-- your men.

719
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,332
Charlie, it might benefit
us both

720
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,799
if we were on more
friendly terms.

721
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,932
You can't be both--
you're either in charge

722
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,365
or your someone's mate,
never both.

723
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:35,432
Well, at least show
some gratitude, then.

724
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:37,099
I saved your life
this afternoon,

725
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,399
yet you've offered
not one word of thanks.

726
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,232
Do you know how many coppers'
lives I've saved?

727
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:42,765
Or how many have saved mine?

728
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,132
It's a given--
I'd have done the same for you.

729
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,399
Yes, well, even so...

730
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,865
Is that what you want
from all this?

731
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:48,532
Someone to say, "Well done"?

732
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,265
Someone to tell you
how clever you are?

733
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:52,732
'Cause no one did
when you were a nipper?

734
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,165
Do the job or don't do the job.

735
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,099
Just don't ask me to tell you
what a good boy you are.

736
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:02,832
Move now, move, move!

737
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,300
What is this place?

738
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,299
A good place
for a wanted man to hide.

739
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:13,765
I thought I was more than clear

740
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:18,199
about you not getting involved
for your own safety.

741
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,532
You didn't seriously think
I'd listen to you, did you?

742
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,765
What can I say?

743
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,465
I'm an optimist.

744
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:29,432
I should've known
you were here.

745
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,099
Like you said,
it's the perfect place to hide.

746
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,266
Mm, apparently not.

747
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,200
What else have you found out?

748
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:44,533
I know that Sean O'Driscoll
killed your brother.

749
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:49,765
First, I thought you were
running from him.

750
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:53,499
But then I realized.

751
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,765
You're not hiding from him.

752
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:58,765
You're hunting him.

753
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:02,299
You've found him,
haven't you?

754
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,232
What have you done, Patrick?

755
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:13,032
Untie him,

756
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:15,965
and we'll take him
to Scotland Yard.

757
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:18,399
There were two witnesses
to my brother's murder.

758
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,532
One was Maggie, a barmaid

759
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:23,699
O'Driscoll
had taken a shine to.

760
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,865
And the other was Eamonn.

761
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:30,865
He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

762
00:40:30,866 --> 00:40:34,766
And you killed him for it.

763
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:42,765
I got to know Maggie
and Eamonn over the years.

764
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:45,032
Kept them on the payroll.

765
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:48,699
The deal was,
if he ever came back,

766
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,432
they'd let me know.

767
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:56,532
Eamonn was as good as his word.

768
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:58,366
But I got to him too late.

769
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:03,499
That's why I moved Maggie
somewhere safe.

770
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,265
Tell all this
to the police.

771
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:07,266
What's sense is there
keeping him here?

772
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,599
So I can put a bullet
in his head.

773
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,965
No! Please, don't.
No, no, no, no, Patrick,
you're not thinking clearly.

774
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:15,099
I've never had more clarity.

775
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,632
My brother was the sweetest,

776
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,799
kindest soul
you could ever meet.

777
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,632
The only family I had left.

778
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,165
And he took him from me!

779
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,332
If you kill him in cold blood,

780
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,665
you are no better than he is.

781
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:27,765
Get out of my way.

782
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:29,265
This will be murder, Patrick.

783
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:30,832
You will hang!
Get out of my way!

784
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,965
No, Patrick,
please do not do this.

785
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:34,633
If not for yourself,
then for me.

786
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
For you?

787
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:41,865
All my life, I've been told

788
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,600
there are things
that I cannot do.

789
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,532
And for all your faults,

790
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:49,332
and God knows there are many,

791
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:53,865
you are the only one
to ever show any faith in me.

792
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:56,499
You're not just
my business partner.

793
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,532
You're my friend.

794
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:11,099
You always know

795
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,066
the right thing to say.

796
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,200
It really is most annoying.

797
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,965
So, what happens now?

798
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,532
The hospital have confirmed
O'Driscoll is in a bad way,

799
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:53,299
but he'll live.

800
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,199
The bullet went
right through his shoulder.

801
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,332
With O'Driscoll
a known killer,

802
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,932
if he intended to stab you
with a shard of glass,

803
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:04,299
an argument can be made
for self-defense.

804
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,065
Patrick saved my life.

805
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:08,399
You'll have to testify

806
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,065
and explain your part
in all this.

807
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:12,999
You should have contacted us
when you knew where he was.

808
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,065
But we'll speak of

809
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:16,299
your good character
and cooperation.

810
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,732
Won't we, Detective Phelps?

811
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:20,766
We will.

812
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,999
But on the matter of kidnap
and obstruction of justice,

813
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,799
we can't turn a blind eye.

814
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,799
Nash will be charged,

815
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,532
and if convicted,

816
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:34,332
he'll be facing
some time inside.

817
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,400
You should go home
and get some sleep.

818
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,465
Can I see him before I leave?

819
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,033
There you go, miss.

820
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,899
How are you?

821
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,732
I've been better.

822
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:30,599
My license will be suspended
whilst I'm awaiting trial.

823
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,632
I'm afraid the office
will have to close.

824
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:34,500
Hopefully not for long.

825
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:55,465
Patrick...
I know what you're
thinking.

826
00:44:55,466 --> 00:44:56,765
What, that you look terrible?

827
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:58,865
That I'm going to prison
for some time.

828
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:01,465
But you're wrong.

829
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:02,899
I know several good lawyers.

830
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,965
A couple of High Court judges,
too.

831
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:06,299
There's every chance
this will just be

832
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,699
a temporary setback.

833
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,165
We'll be back on course
before you know it.

834
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,666
And with my good looks
and your brains, well...

835
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,099
You don't believe me,
do you?

836
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,132
Tch.

837
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:28,166
Don't answer that.

838
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:33,666
What will you do
in the meantime?

839
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,065
What I always do.

840
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:43,432
I'll be fine.

841
00:45:43,433 --> 00:45:45,465
Of that,
I have no doubt.

842
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:56,365
I'm...

843
00:45:56,366 --> 00:45:58,865
Truly sorry.
You don't have to apologize.

844
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:00,966
Mmm, perhaps.

845
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:07,499
But I want you
to think I'm a

846
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,199
good person.

847
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,765
That will never happen,
Patrick.

848
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:13,566
No?

849
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,699
But I'll always keep trying.

850
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,499
The city gets worse and worse.

851
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,999
It took me an age
to find a cab.

852
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,165
And why do we have to meet
in this bloody place again?

853
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:47,432
Because I like it.

854
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:49,699
Well, I won't draw this out
any longer than I have to.

855
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,299
My cab is waiting for me.

856
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,465
The job is yours,
effective immediately.

857
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:56,032
When Wellington returns
from New York,

858
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,999
he will resume his post.

859
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,199
But you will have had
solid experience,

860
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,132
and we can move you on
elsewhere.

861
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:04,032
You'll get a letter
with all the details:

862
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:05,566
salary and so on.

863
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,533
No.

864
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,866
What?

865
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:14,532
I don't want it.

866
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:16,699
What do you mean,
you don't want it?

867
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,232
I cannot think of a clearer way
to express that.

868
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:23,233
Don't you have any ambition?

869
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,232
In truth,

870
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,166
I'm not entirely sure.

871
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:32,565
I know I'm happy
in my position.

872
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:34,700
I have much to learn.

873
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:39,732
Each time, I think
you cannot disappoint me more,

874
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,200
and each time,
you prove me wrong.

875
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,599
That is your concern, Father,
not mine.

876
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,566
I no longer care.

877
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,999
Well, if not you, then who?

878
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,165
God knows we're not spoiled
for choice.

879
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:10,332
There is one man
I would recommend.

880
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:12,899
He is, I believe,

881
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,965
the best man for the job.

882
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:19,999
So, I'll say it once again
for the hard of thinking.

883
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,232
Every file for
every active investigation

884
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,065
to be on my desk
by 6:00 tonight.

885
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:28,265
I want it written
in something

886
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:30,165
that resembles
the Queen's English.

887
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:32,533
Right, dismissed.

888
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,866
Not you,
Detective Fitzroy.

889
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:46,900
Thank you.

890
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:51,633
Was there anything else?

891
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:00,666
Was there
anything else, sir?

892
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,065
Was there anything else, sir?

893
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,633
No-- now bugger off.

894
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,499
Shut the door.

895
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,233
Things haven't quite
turned out how I'd hoped.

896
00:49:57,566 --> 00:49:58,732
Sometimes,

897
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,300
I do wonder...

898
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,966
If it's all worth it?

899
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:12,532
You are a good detective,
Eliza, very good.

900
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,332
And whatever happens
from here,

901
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,133
you'll find a way
to make it work.

902
00:50:17,466 --> 00:50:20,665
You always do.

903
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,632
Goodness!

904
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:40,932
Those stairs
have left me quite puffed.

905
00:50:40,933 --> 00:50:43,465
You mind your back, Barnabus--
you know how it gets.

906
00:50:43,466 --> 00:50:44,899
Oh, heaven.

907
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,665
I'm feeling a slight twinge
in my lower vertebrae.

908
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:48,099
I told you
to be careful.

909
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,965
Here,
you need help.

910
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:51,732
Thank you.

911
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:52,899
Thank you for your help,
Clarence.

912
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,132
You really didn't have to.

913
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:56,665
It's my pleasure.

914
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:58,299
Well, perhaps
not my pleasure.

915
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,199
I've never been one
for manual labor.

916
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,132
You have my word,
Clarence,

917
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:03,932
I'll be in touch
when I'm back on my feet.

918
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:05,632
I look forward to it,
Miss Scarlet.

919
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:06,865
Will you be all right?

920
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:08,599
I have some small savings.

921
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,599
I shall be quite well.

922
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:14,165
Nothing heavy,
Barnabus!

923
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,465
Please don't fuss,
my dear.

924
00:51:16,466 --> 00:51:17,899
I want you in one piece.

925
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,032
You should not say such things--
it's not Christian.

926
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:23,065
Miss Scarlet?

927
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:24,766
Oh! One moment.

928
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:36,432
All finished,
Mr. Hill?

929
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:37,999
All done, miss.

930
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:49,965
It's perfect.
