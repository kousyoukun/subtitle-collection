1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,932
Inspector Wellington--
how have you

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,832
found him recently?
I'm concerned about him.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,299
You need to rest.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,399
Sleep is a luxury that
I don't have at the moment.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,732
Are you free to dine
tomorrow evening?

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,665
Tomorrow evening it is, then.

7
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,532
Police! Put down your weapons!

8
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,799
I said put them down, now!

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,265
It's Inspector Wellington.

10
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:22,565
He's been shot.

11
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,999
They cannot say for certain
if he will survive.

12
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,199
Sorry I'm late today.

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,365
There's a new ward sister,

14
00:01:58,366 --> 00:01:59,565
and she wouldn't let me in
at first.

15
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,665
I put my mother's ring on my
wedding finger

16
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,565
and told her you were
my husband.

17
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,632
She seemed a little
disappointed

18
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,465
that you were,
perhaps, taken.

19
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:10,966
I think you've made quite a stir
amongst the nurses, William.

20
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:30,132
Everyone has a different opinion
of my visits with you.

21
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,099
Ivy believes I should
just sit and talk to you

22
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,665
as if nothing's happened.

23
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,032
Detective Fitzroy
suggested reading aloud

24
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,365
from a Russian novel,

25
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,599
the title of which
I cannot pronounce.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,765
I suppose it might
provoke you into sitting up

27
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:47,532
and begging me to stop.

28
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,799
And Mr. Potts...

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,065
Well, Mr. Potts
was surprisingly thoughtful.

30
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:58,132
He advised that as you are a man
who despises a lot of chatter,

31
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,199
that I should merely sit
with you.

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,032
That would be company enough.

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,332
Please wake up.

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,300
William.

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,900
Wake up.

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,065
Wake up!

37
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,599
Wake up!

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,666
Wake up!

39
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,299
I said, "Wake up!"

40
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,832
Get out of here! Shoo!

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,332
Get out of here!
Go on, bugger off!

42
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,799
Bugger off.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,065
Bugger off!
All right, all right,
I'm going!

44
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,932
What can I get you, huh?

45
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,299
I was just wondering
if you needed

46
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,533
some help running the stall.

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,799
No.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,265
I'm a hard worker.

49
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,299
I'll work for free for today
so you can see

50
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,465
how good I am.
I said no.

51
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,599
Please.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,265
I haven't eaten in two days.

53
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,032
Yes, darling?

54
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,065
Loaf of bread, please.

55
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,100
Yes, of course.

56
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,299
Hey! Hey!

57
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,433
Hey!

58
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,999
Dear God.

59
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:21,232
Morning.

60
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:24,265
- Morning.
- Morning.

61
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,832
What on Earth?

62
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,832
Lizzie!

63
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,766
What are you doing home?

64
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,099
You've been expelled!

65
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,899
No! Well, not exactly.

66
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,199
I was told to leave the
premises with immediate effect.

67
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,865
How is that
not being expelled?

68
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,832
It's not a school, Ivy.

69
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,232
It's a training college.

70
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,065
You're not expelled from a
college, you get sent down.

71
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,599
Oh, pardon my ignorance.

72
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,032
I've lost track
of how many places

73
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,065
you've been
sent down from.

74
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,399
It's not my fault.

75
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,699
I don't want to be

76
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,399
a governess
or a schoolmistress,

77
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,832
or any of those things.

78
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,165
And I was planning
to come back anyway.

79
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,499
I got Father's letter
about Skip.

80
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,099
Oh, so your father's
dog dies,

81
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,799
and that just happens
to coincide

82
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,632
with you being expelled.
It's not his dog,

83
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,599
it's the family dog,
whom I very much loved.

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,565
That is not the point,
and you know it!

85
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,565
You're 16 years old,
Lizzie!

86
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:16,900
It's time you grew up!

87
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,565
Well, if I wanted to get
shouted at, I would've stayed

88
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,999
at college.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,966
And I really did love that dog.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,899
What are we going
to do with you?

91
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:40,265
God only knows what your
father's going to say.

92
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,465
Is the photographer on his way?

93
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,500
Yes, Inspector Scarlet.

94
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,965
I know this man.

95
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,832
We used to work together.

96
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,432
His name's, um...

97
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,999
Wallis.

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,166
Arthur Wallis.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,133
Doesn't seem like a robbery,
though.

100
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,665
Who was it that found him?

101
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,365
Good afternoon.

102
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,865
I've been here hours--
what's going on?

103
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,165
You were asked
to give a statement

104
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,465
to the chief investigating
officer?

105
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,865
That would be me.

106
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,465
My name's Detective Inspector
Henry Scarlet-- and you are?

107
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,265
I've already given
a statement.

108
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,565
I was walking past,

109
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:38,065
I saw a body, I went and
got help-- can I go now?

110
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,132
Yeah, your name, please?

111
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,365
William Wellington.

112
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,565
Wellington.

113
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,999
As in the duke?

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,799
Who?

115
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,199
What are they teaching you
in schools these days?

116
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,199
You'd better
not be thinking

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,365
of fitting me up for this.

118
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,865
I've heard about London
bobbies.

119
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:52,932
No one is accusing you
of anything.

120
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,465
I mean, very few murderers
would bring the police

121
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,965
to a crime scene.
I'm missing work.

122
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,199
I've a job on a pie stall.

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,499
I'll lose it if I don't get
back there.

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,765
You either answer
my questions here

125
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:01,999
or down at Scotland Yard.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,532
Your choice.
Get out of my way!

127
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,299
You can't leave me in here!

128
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,065
I'm going to the city mortuary.

129
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,199
When I get back,
bring him to my office.

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,932
- Yes, sir.

131
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,799
Lizzie?
There's someone here to see you.

132
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,632
Well, who is it?

133
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,232
Mrs. Parker and her son.

134
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,265
No, no, no,
tell them I'm, I'm...
Ah!

135
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,965
You were correct, Rupert.

136
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,432
Miss Scarlet has returned.

137
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:33,632
I'll leave you to it.

138
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,700
Thank you so much, Ivy.

139
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,200
Mrs. Parker.

140
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,199
Mr. Parker--
to what do I owe

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,132
this unexpected pleasure?

142
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:46,199
Rupert was taking his morning
stroll in Regent's Park,

143
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,399
when he came across
your neighbor Dr. Williams.

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,465
The good doctor mentioned

145
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,365
that he had seen you
returning home,

146
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,499
suitcase in hand.

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,965
Rupert relayed this to me,

148
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,532
and I said,
"Oh, this cannot be correct.

149
00:09:56,533 --> 00:10:00,266
Miss Scarlet is in Wimbledon,
training to be a governess."

150
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:04,365
Term has finished, and I have
returned home for the holidays.

151
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:08,065
The academic term does not end
for another three weeks.

152
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,566
I trust nothing untoward
has occurred?

153
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,532
Well, my classmates and I were
making such good progress,

154
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,532
we were permitted

155
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,265
to finish early.

156
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,999
I would remind you,
Miss Scarlet,

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,365
that yourself and your father
are my tenants,

158
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,565
and a stain
on your reputation

159
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,699
is a stain on mine.

160
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,265
Mrs. Parker, your reputation
is always at the forefront

161
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:32,465
of my mind.

162
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,765
I'm glad to hear it.

163
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,532
And now we shall take
refreshments.

164
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,932
I shall take tea.

165
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:38,965
Rupert will not.

166
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,299
Your statement
makes little sense.

167
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,565
All right, let's
try this one again.

168
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:54,465
So, you say
you were walking past

169
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:56,265
when you saw the body
and you went to get help.

170
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,432
Yes.

171
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,932
Well, where were you
walking to, exactly,

172
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,365
given that
it's a dead end?

173
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:01,600
Hmm?

174
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,265
See, my guess is that you
were sleeping in the alleyway.

175
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,500
Those aren't my things.

176
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,165
Document of discharge
from a workhouse in Glasgow.

177
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,465
In the name
William James Wellington.

178
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:20,032
That's you.

179
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:23,099
How long have you been living
out on the streets?

180
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,099
It's a while,
by the look of you.

181
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,665
I imagine you're hungry.

182
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,432
I know what you're
trying to do.

183
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,799
Be nice to me
so I'll talk.

184
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,399
Yes.

185
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,765
That's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

186
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,265
So, are you hungry
or not?

187
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:53,832
Now, if you go downstairs
and wait in the kitchen,

188
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,932
I'll have my housekeeper
make you some supper.

189
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,400
Go on.

190
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:12,032
Lizzie.

191
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:15,865
What are you doing here?

192
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,699
Father, please calm down.

193
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,065
Do not tell me to calm down.

194
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,699
God, you would try
the patience of a saint!

195
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,499
Well, I did not ask
to be sent to that place.

196
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,899
You have no idea what it's like.

197
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,999
You are not
a child anymore, Lizzie.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,665
You must start behaving like
a respectable young woman!

199
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,265
And most girls your age would
have been married off by now.

200
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,932
This was the solution
to our compromise.

201
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,365
Your compromise, not mine.

202
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:38,265
You know what path
I wish to follow.

203
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,832
I cannot have
this conversation again.

204
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,600
Lizzie, give us a moment
to talk, hmm?

205
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,165
We have a guest
downstairs.

206
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,432
Go and make him
something to eat.

207
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,532
I'll be down shortly.

208
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:53,532
Make him something to eat?

209
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,699
You have been attending
cookery classes, have you not?

210
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,165
Um, sometimes, yes.

211
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,699
There's a smoked ham
on top of the oven.

212
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,599
Give him a slice of that.

213
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,365
Good evening,
my name is Miss Scarlet.

214
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,566
I believe you are...

215
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,999
...an associate of my father's.

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,599
He said there'd be food.

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,499
Yes, I cooked a smoked ham
this afternoon.

218
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,733
I'll cut you a slice.

219
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,065
So, how do you
know my father?

220
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,065
Do you work for the police?

221
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,966
You got any bread?

222
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,332
I'm not sure.

223
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,966
I shall take a look at
what else I made today.

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,400
You could stop a bullet
with that.

225
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,432
Uh, you are Scottish?

226
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,499
Whereabouts are you from?

227
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,000
Do you always ask
this many questions?

228
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:07,900
I'll see if we have bread.

229
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,299
I heard shouting just now.

230
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,899
He was yelling at you,
wasn't he, your pa?

231
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,000
What did you do?

232
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,365
Why do you assume
it was my fault?

233
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,565
I'm right, aren't I?

234
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:24,865
What did you do?

235
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,533
Do you always ask
this many questions?

236
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,133
I'll have some water.

237
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,733
Sink's just there.

238
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,165
I'm a guest in this house.

239
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,765
Oh!

240
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:41,965
Well, then, perhaps you might
show some basic courtesy.

241
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,399
We'll start with "please"
and "thank you,"

242
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,165
then move on to eating
like a gentleman and not a pig.

243
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,666
In a trough.

244
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:57,665
It's my fault she lost her way.

245
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,499
I indulged her
after her mother died.

246
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,665
That girl was born headstrong.

247
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,533
Nothing you could've done
would've changed that.

248
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,899
I encouraged her
to be interested in my work.

249
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,265
Did her a disservice.

250
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:13,900
Gave her ambitions
she can never fulfill.

251
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,699
But...

252
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,999
Right now, I must speak
to our guest.

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,299
I fear I have a long night
ahead of me.

254
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:24,932
Did you give him
something to eat?

255
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:27,100
I tried to,
but he walked out.

256
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,699
It wasn't my fault.

257
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,232
That bad, is it?

258
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,632
What?

259
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:42,699
You only do chores
when you're feeling guilty.

260
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,199
Where's Father?

261
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,065
He's been out all night
looking for that young man.

262
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:50,732
Came back early for a change
of clothes and some breakfast,

263
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:53,365
then went out again.

264
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:57,632
Did you speak to him?

265
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,633
Sit down, Lizzie.

266
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,032
Things are hard for him
at the moment.

267
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:16,365
The money
that your mother left,

268
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,765
it's running out.

269
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,032
And this house
is expensive to keep.

270
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,999
He's a proud man,
and he'll never admit it,

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,132
but these things weigh
heavily on his shoulders.

272
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,399
So,

273
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,599
if you want to help him,

274
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,432
just do as he asks.

275
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:37,599
And that might mean
doing some things

276
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,265
that you don't want to do.

277
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,799
Well, what kind of things?

278
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,999
Oh, we're not expecting
any visitors,

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,133
are we?

280
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,432
Some time ago,
after your mother's passing,

281
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,865
I spoke to your father

282
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:56,765
and offered
to take you under my wing,

283
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,365
to give you
the kind of education

284
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,965
a young lady
ought to be receiving.

285
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:04,465
He declined, initially.

286
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:07,432
But I have received
a note from him

287
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:10,032
saying he wishes to take
me up on my kind offer.

288
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,232
Excuse me?

289
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,266
Sorry.

290
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,333
I'll take that, thank you.

291
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,865
How did you find me?

292
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,399
Oh, everybody thinks
themselves unique,

293
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,933
but we all have patterns of
behavior that can be predicted.

294
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,132
Take you, for example.

295
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:08,565
You're from Glasgow.

296
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,032
So your train would have
arrived at King's Cross station.

297
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:14,165
Now, I suspect that you stayed
in the area looking for work,

298
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,332
but were unsuccessful.

299
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,733
Hence why you're now
sleeping on the streets.

300
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,099
So, to rectify the
situation, you turned

301
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,299
to low-level theft--
now, there are

302
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,332
five streets
in the King's Cross area

303
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,599
where pickpocketing is rife.

304
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,632
This is the third one I tried.

305
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:31,599
What do you want from me?

306
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,533
Tell me what you saw
in the alley.

307
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:39,999
What's in it for me?

308
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,099
Well, from what I can tell,

309
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,399
you're an intelligent young man.

310
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,899
Help me, and I will help you
in whatever way I can.

311
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,265
I mean, you didn't travel 400
miles just to be a pickpocket.

312
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:58,199
You saw the murder
take place, didn't you?

313
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,599
Yeah.

314
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,332
Okay, come on.

315
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,799
We shall be hosting the ladies

316
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,099
of the Kensington
Benevolent Fund.

317
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,799
They have raised
thousands of pounds

318
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,065
for the poor and needy
of London, and...

319
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,065
No, no, no!

320
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,132
The Wedgwood china--
think, girl.

321
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:19,065
Sorry, ma'am.

322
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:23,532
When the guests arrive, you
will be polite and deferential.

323
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,399
When speaking,

324
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,165
do so
with clear diction.

325
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,565
Stay away
from contentious topics,

326
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:32,899
and talk instead of your
hobbies and interests.

327
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,699
You do have hobbies
and interests?

328
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,832
Well, I love to read
my father's books.

329
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,965
Marvelous.

330
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,099
In particular, the ones

331
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,499
on forensic pathology.

332
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,699
There's this one chapter
I must have read 20 times

333
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,399
about the livor mortis.

334
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,032
The postmortem settling
of the blood in the veins

335
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,099
and arteries that
can often indicate

336
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,232
whether a body has been moved

337
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,833
after a murder.

338
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:56,799
Fetch the doilies

339
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,966
for the cake stand.

340
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,165
A good servant,

341
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,899
like a good child,

342
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,165
must be seen,
but not heard.

343
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,299
But have no doubt

344
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,399
that when they are alone,

345
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,132
they talk of the things
we have said in their presence.

346
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:16,699
Therefore, it is imperative that
we say nothing odd or peculiar

347
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,832
that could undermine
our position

348
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,965
as their superiors.
But I only said...

349
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,665
Someday, you will be married.

350
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,032
And your husband must feel
confident in your ability

351
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,799
to run a household.

352
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,932
Speaking of marriage,

353
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,132
Rupert rarely has an interest
in any young ladies,

354
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,332
but he is continually
asking questions about you.

355
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,932
I believe he finds you
quite fascinating.

356
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,665
Mrs. Parker...

357
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,365
Your father is a man
of limited means.

358
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,565
Rupert is the heir
to my fortune.

359
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:50,165
I believe it would be
a beneficial arrangement

360
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,732
for both our families.

361
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,199
Now, take a seat,

362
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,732
and we shall look
at your posture.

363
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,999
Sometimes being back
at the crime scene

364
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,299
can help trigger memories
we didn't know we had.

365
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,432
So, you said you were sat down.

366
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,832
I, I was asleep
behind those barrels.

367
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,065
Mm-hmm, but something
woke you up.

368
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,999
I heard footsteps.

369
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,265
Someone running.

370
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,299
Two people running.

371
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,299
One was your friend,
Mr. Wallis.

372
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,899
The other was younger.

373
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,265
Like, 20, 21,
something like that.

374
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,365
Good, good, go on.

375
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,865
The younger man threw
Mr. Wallis

376
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,232
up against that wall,

377
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,565
which is when he started
to strangle him.

378
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:27,532
Then he threw him
to the ground.

379
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,999
Well, can you describe
the attacker?

380
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,565
Fair hair.

381
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,765
Uh, tall, perhaps six feet.

382
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,065
And rich-looking.

383
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:38,032
Fancy clothes.
What else?

384
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,865
As he was strangling him,

385
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,632
he knelt down
and whispered something.

386
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,499
It was as if...

387
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,266
As if he knew him.

388
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,365
Hmm.

389
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:55,732
It really was
the most wonderful evening.

390
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:59,299
The food was prepared
by Marcel Laurent himself,

391
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,199
the chef de cuisine
at the Brabham Hotel.

392
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,799
Lady Harper Jones
is the jewel

393
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,165
in the crown of
our social circle.

394
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,199
Oh, but I fear I have
been talking too long.

395
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,365
Let us learn more

396
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,765
about our Miss Scarlet.

397
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,132
Tell me about yourself, my dear.

398
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,432
Miss Scarlet has

399
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:19,199
a number of interests,
including embroidery

400
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,165
and watercolors.

401
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,365
Well, it is reassuring

402
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:25,999
to meet a young lady
with such wholesome interests.

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,499
You must join us this evening
at Bornborough Hall.

404
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,099
I'm holding a soirée
for my daughter's birthday.

405
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,232
Rupert is going.

406
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,132
I'm sure he would be
delighted to escort you.

407
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:38,365
That is most kind,
but it is...

408
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:40,099
A splendid idea.

409
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,299
I confess, Miss Scarlet

410
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,965
has quite piqued
my Rupert's interest.

411
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,732
Well, I will, of course,
have to ask my father.

412
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,499
Your father has put
his faith in me

413
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,665
to look after
your best interests.

414
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,765
Rupert will pick you up at 8:00.

415
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:54,765
Marvelous.

416
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:55,765
Marvelous.

417
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:57,300
Marvelous.

418
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:04,032
It wasn't any of these.

419
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:06,265
I may cast the net
a little wider,

420
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:08,465
get you to look at
a few more, but not today.

421
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:09,532
Give your eyes a rest.

422
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:13,399
How long have you been a copper?

423
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,365
Signed up on November 10, 1848.

424
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:21,465
So that's 23?
Ooh, God, no.

425
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,165
24 years ago.

426
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,665
Tempus fugit.

427
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,733
What?

428
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:29,066
Time flies.

429
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:32,665
I joined the same week
as Arthur, our murder victim.

430
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,932
You were friends?

431
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:36,599
Mmm, you know, for a while.

432
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,432
I just don't think this place
was really for him.

433
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:39,965
He left to become
a private detective.

434
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,465
Where did you sleep last night?

435
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,599
I don't know,
it was some doorway.

436
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,165
There's a spare room
at my house.

437
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,566
You can have a bed
for a few nights.

438
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,765
Why would you do that?

439
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,199
Well, I need you
where I can find you.

440
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,732
But if you are gonna stay,

441
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,399
you're gonna have to clean
yourself up a bit, I mean,

442
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,299
my housekeeper's gonna have
a fit if you lie on her sheets

443
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,732
like that.

444
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,699
There's a public washhouse
on Hanover Square,

445
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,232
so wash your clothes,
have a shave, take a bath.

446
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,365
I assume they're
your only clothes.

447
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,799
Well, to tell the truth,

448
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,965
they're not even mine.
Right, well,

449
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:17,899
there's a thrift shop on
the way to the washhouse.

450
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,265
Uh, McKenzie's.

451
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:22,300
See what you can get
for that.

452
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,465
How do you know
I won't just take your money

453
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,633
and run off with it?

454
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,565
I guess I'm just gonna
have to trust you.

455
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:43,265
How much longer
is this going to take?

456
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:45,065
It will take as long
as it takes.

457
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,300
Now stand still.

458
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,565
I don't want to go
to this stupid party.

459
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:52,465
Everybody likes parties.

460
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:54,599
No, they don't--
they just say they do.

461
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,932
I certainly don't want
to go with Rupert Parker.

462
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:59,299
His mother won't be happy
until we're man and wife.

463
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,965
Well, I think you're safe there.

464
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,999
I doubt he's the marrying type.

465
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,465
Well, what makes you say that?

466
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:06,865
Done.

467
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:12,732
Now, will you please
stop growing, young lady?

468
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,499
Oh, Lizzie.

469
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,765
You look beautiful.

470
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,465
I can see your mother in you,

471
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,532
I really can.

472
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:21,633
Oh.

473
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,300
Course, your mother
used to smile more.

474
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,032
I'll get that.

475
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,732
You can tidy up in here.

476
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,165
Put everything back
in the sewing box.

477
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,899
Uh, neatly, please.

478
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:50,099
You're William?

479
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,832
Mr. Scarlet said
to expect you.

480
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,165
Come on in.

481
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,265
It's cold out there--
you'll catch your death.

482
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:57,765
I've made up the spare room.

483
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,332
Do you have
any other belongings?

484
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,365
No, it's just me.

485
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:06,399
Well, if there's anything else
you need, just let me know.

486
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,999
- That's very kind of you--
- I will.

487
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,099
Are you hungry?

488
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,899
Would you like
something to eat?

489
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,632
Yes, please--
thank you.

490
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,500
Hello, again.

491
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:18,932
Hello.

492
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:21,866
Get yourself downstairs
to the kitchen.

493
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,832
Why's he come back?

494
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,632
The young man is going to be
staying with us for a few days.

495
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,865
And you're to stay away
from him, young lady.

496
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:36,999
Now, you've a bit of time
before Mr. Parker is due,

497
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,165
so why don't you
go and tidy that bedroom?

498
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,799
Go on.

499
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,933
Now.

500
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,432
Mr. Wellington.

501
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:08,432
It's William.

502
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:11,099
William.

503
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,299
I'm afraid there's been
something of a mix-up.

504
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,299
Father is still at work,
but he's sent a message

505
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,565
to say that we are to dine
with friends this evening,

506
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,965
and he would like you
to come along.

507
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,133
Miss Woods just made me dinner.

508
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:25,565
Ivy is unaware
of this change of plan.

509
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,465
She is in the drawing room
sewing.

510
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:29,032
I didn't want to disturb her.

511
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:31,965
Do you own a dinner suit?

512
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,533
Let me see.

513
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:36,899
No.

514
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,899
My uncle stayed with us last
year, he is about your height.

515
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,132
I believe his dinner suit is in
the wardrobe in the spare room.

516
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,566
I'm not wearing
some old man's clothes.

517
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,465
My father has opened
his house to you.

518
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,965
Refusing this kind
of invitation

519
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,599
is not the done thing.

520
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,132
Mm.

521
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:02,966
I don't care
about the done thing.

522
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,533
Fine.

523
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,165
You are a very rude
young man.

524
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,132
I will tell my father
as much.

525
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:28,766
Mr. Parker.
Miss Scarlet.

526
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,365
Wait!

527
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,065
William.

528
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,500
Shall we?

529
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,633
Whoa, there, whoa.

530
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,666
Good evening, sir.

531
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,332
Thank you, sir.

532
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,932
Thank you.

533
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,365
Where's your father?

534
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,599
Oh, he sent a telegram
saying he would be delayed

535
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,732
and sadly could
no longer attend.

536
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:08,999
He sent a telegram?
When?

537
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,599
Shortly before we left--
but he requested

538
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,365
that you accompany me
nonetheless.

539
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:14,832
Ah.

540
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,565
I thought that's what
he was doing.

541
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,065
Thank you.
Of course.

542
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:23,832
What exactly
is going on?

543
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,365
Very well.

544
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:29,332
I may have brought you here
under slight false pretenses.

545
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,265
Mr. Parker's mother owns
the leasehold

546
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,632
to our property.
Hm.

547
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,399
She is very keen for myself
and her son

548
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,799
to become better acquainted

549
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,499
and I am... less keen.

550
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,065
He doesn't seem
that interested in you.

551
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,599
Thank the Lord
for small mercies.

552
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,499
Do you always lie
this much?

553
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,199
It wasn't a lie.

554
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,632
It was a temporary departure
from the truth.

555
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,899
Okay.

556
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,065
But you have my word,
I'll never lie to you again.

557
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:57,365
And, of course,
you always keep to your word.

558
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:59,299
Always.

559
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,965
Slàinte.

560
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,833
Cheers.

561
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,699
So...

562
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,299
What exactly are you doing
with my father, anyway?

563
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,132
He said you'd ask that,
and he said not to tell you.

564
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:20,065
Hm.

565
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,599
Very well.

566
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,699
But perhaps one day,
I shall meet your father

567
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,565
and he and I
will share a secret.

568
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,800
Good luck finding him.

569
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,399
I thought you said
there'd be real food.

570
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,965
There should be canapés
somewhere.

571
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:37,165
What are canopies?

572
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:41,165
Oh, they are small snacks, and
it's pronounced "can-ah-pay."

573
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:44,132
Can of peas?

574
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:46,199
No, it...

575
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,299
Are you teasing me?

576
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,699
Yes.

577
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,132
Well, there should
be a waiter somewhere.

578
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:55,632
I'll see if I can
catch his eye.

579
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:57,032
Eliza...

580
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:58,732
Just be patient.

581
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,432
I witnessed a murder.

582
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,499
That's what I'm doing
with your father.

583
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,232
He wants my help
trying to find the killer.

584
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,532
And I think I've found him.

585
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:10,865
Cheers.

586
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:13,465
Cheers!

587
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,499
Are you sure it was him?
As sure as I can be.

588
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,899
Do you know his name?
No.

589
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,899
I shall go back in
and ask him.
And say what?

590
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,965
"My friend thinks you're a
murderer-- what's your name?"

591
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:27,132
Well, I imagine I'll find
a more elegant way to put it.
No.

592
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,165
Let's go and find your father
and bring him here.

593
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,799
It would help his inquiries
if we could at least

594
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,399
tell him
the name of our suspect.

595
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,932
Our suspect?
This has nothing to do with you.

596
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,899
Come on, we're leaving.
Very well.

597
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,399
I'll go find Rupert.

598
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,899
I'm sure his driver will take us
wherever we need to go.

599
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,365
I'll meet you outside.

600
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:46,600
Fine.

601
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,165
Not a single bloody pheasant
to be seen.

602
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,165
Now, why on Earth he held
a shoot in December,

603
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,232
I'll never know--
the man's a bloody fool.

604
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,265
Well, I can see you
have your mother's charm.

605
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:14,399
I met her earlier today--
an inspiring lady.

606
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,965
Now, you didn't walk
halfway across this room

607
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,366
to talk to me
about my mother.

608
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:22,165
Well, as I said,
I believe we have met before.

609
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,199
Well, perhaps

610
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
you were just saying that
to...

611
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,866
...gain my attention.

612
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:31,865
Kindly remove your hand.

613
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:35,865
Oh, I would do.

614
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:37,333
If you meant it.

615
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,632
I wonder if you're aware

616
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:43,099
that the worst bite a person
can receive

617
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,100
is not from a rat or dog,
but a fellow human being.

618
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:51,165
There are bacteria
in the saliva

619
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,765
that can cause infection,
blood poisoning,

620
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,700
and, in some cases, amputation.

621
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:05,233
A pleasure speaking to you.

622
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,965
Thomas Harper Jones,
son of Lady Harper Jones

623
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:22,599
and quite the most obnoxious man
I've ever met.

624
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,032
What, you spoke to him?

625
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:26,099
We needed to know what kind
of man we were dealing with.

626
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,099
We?!

627
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,265
My father is under

628
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,865
an awful lot of strain
at the moment.

629
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,732
It would be unfair
to waste his time...

630
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:33,365
...if this is not the man
he seeks.

631
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:34,965
And it is my belief

632
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:37,265
that you and I should
investigate the matter further

633
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:38,665
before telling him anything.

634
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,265
Agreed?

635
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,499
For God's sakes, Lizzie,
what were you thinking?

636
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,765
It was my fault--
I wanted to find out his name.

637
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:48,565
If I had known she had taken
William to the party,

638
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:49,899
I would never have said
anything, but I...

639
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,399
We'll get to that,
believe me.

640
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,765
Are you sure
it was him?
Certain.

641
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:56,032
And you've told no one else
of this?

642
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:57,733
Just Eliza.

643
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,599
The Harper Jones family
are rich and influential,

644
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,799
with powerful friends.

645
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,165
It is vital
this stays between us for now.

646
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,065
Might I suggest...
No.

647
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:09,333
You don't know what I was
going to...
Yes, I do.

648
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,800
It's late.

649
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:16,832
We will talk of this tomorrow.

650
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,733
Go with Ivy--
she'll show you to your room.

651
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:25,399
Lizzie, wait.

652
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,665
I'm tired of arguing.
Yes, as am I.

653
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:30,665
Look, I know you wish
to follow in my footsteps.

654
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,332
But, as I have told you
before,

655
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,765
it is impossible.

656
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,932
So, instead, I'm to spend
the rest of my days

657
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,599
drinking tea with the dullest
people known to humanity.

658
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,899
Life's hard enough already,
Lizzie.

659
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,565
Don't get involved
with this.

660
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:46,200
Please.

661
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:58,499
Good day, Mrs. Parker!

662
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,699
Good morning.

663
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,132
Ooh, good morning,
Mrs. Parker.

664
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,765
Miss Scarlet.

665
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,365
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

666
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:08,432
I confess
to being pleasantly surprised

667
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,132
to receive your invitation
for a walk.

668
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:13,799
Yesterday, you seemed
somewhat disinterested.

669
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,365
I was merely concentrating,
that was all.

670
00:36:16,366 --> 00:36:18,799
I didn't want to miss
any pearls of wisdom.

671
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,899
Rupert tells me you had
a most pleasant evening.

672
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,399
I would not be surprised
if he calls on you again.

673
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,899
I certainly hope so.

674
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,599
It was a splendid
evening, indeed.

675
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,132
Speaking of which,

676
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:35,599
I wondered if I might be so
bold as to make a suggestion.

677
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,465
Oh.

678
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:40,699
I am sorry to have missed
the festivities last night.

679
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,599
As you know,
I had a prior engagement.

680
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,999
But Miss Scarlet had
the most marvelous time

681
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,899
and insisted on coming
to thank you in person.

682
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,432
How very kind.

683
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:55,165
My only regret is that you
and I did not find time to talk.

684
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:59,032
I'd love to hear more about
you and your delightful family.

685
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,599
Your daughter, of course, and,
indeed, your son.

686
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,832
Thomas, I believe?

687
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,132
It would be my pleasure.

688
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:08,665
- Do please follow me.
- Thank you.

689
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,632
What a charming young lady.

690
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:11,965
Isn't she?

691
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,965
Is that him?

692
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:30,132
That's him.

693
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,499
Right, I think it best
you wait here.

694
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,032
He might have seen you
at the party.

695
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,532
What are you going to do?

696
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,366
Tread carefully.

697
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:44,432
Pickpockets? That's news to me.

698
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,499
I've heard nothing of it.

699
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,665
I'm afraid there's been
a spate

700
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,965
of such incidents
in this very street, sir.

701
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,165
The last incident was,
uh, two days ago.

702
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:57,132
Early evening,
about 6:00.

703
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:59,532
Were you, uh,
were you here at that time?

704
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,899
No.

705
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,865
Where were you?

706
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,565
Why does that matter?

707
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:08,265
Well, sometimes pickpockets
target a gentleman

708
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,299
such as yourself, and follow
him from wherever he's been.

709
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,232
A restaurant, hotel.

710
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:14,632
If we can establish
a pattern,

711
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,932
it might help us catch them.

712
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:19,332
I was at my other club.

713
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,465
The Ottoman, on Gray's Inn Road.

714
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,465
I was there all night

715
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,865
and saw nothing untoward
upon my arrival or my exit.

716
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:26,999
Very glad to hear it.

717
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,565
The, um, the investigation

718
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:32,465
has taken a rather
sinister turn of late.

719
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:34,032
We believe one of the thieves

720
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,733
may have murdered
a private detective.

721
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,499
A private detective?
Mm.

722
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,465
Mr. Arthur Wallis-- good man.

723
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:43,732
Former police officer.

724
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,432
Why is it just me
you're talking to?

725
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:58,999
Oh, I intend to speak
to all the gentlemen here.

726
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,999
I just happened
to catch your eye first.

727
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:12,032
And, with my husband away
in the Indies,

728
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:15,099
Thomas has been running
our affairs in London.

729
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,899
That must be quite
a burden to carry.

730
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,532
Have you noticed any change
in his behavior of late?

731
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:22,865
Change in his behavior?

732
00:39:22,866 --> 00:39:25,065
Miss Scarlet,

733
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:28,199
you have done nothing but ask
questions about Thomas.

734
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,999
I would remind you

735
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,032
it was Rupert who accompanied
you last evening.

736
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:34,965
Forgive me,
I was merely curious.

737
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:38,565
The study of human nature is
something of a hobby of mine.

738
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,332
- Hm.
- Madam,

739
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,999
your appointment.

740
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,032
Oh, of course--
thank you, Annie.

741
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:45,699
Oh, ladies,

742
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,399
I'm afraid you must excuse me.

743
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,232
I have numerous appointments

744
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:53,965
that I must attend to, and as I
am currently without a driver,

745
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:55,865
I'm having to rely
on hackney carriages,

746
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:58,165
and I find that they take
an age.

747
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:01,199
A good driver
is like a good lawyer.

748
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,365
You must hold on
to him at all costs.

749
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:05,965
Pettifer was exactly that.

750
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,332
He'd been with us for years.

751
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,332
But he and Thomas

752
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:14,165
had cross words, and
he left the very next morning.

753
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,632
They had cross words?
What about?

754
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,965
We shall take up no more
of your valuable time.

755
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:24,132
Come, Miss Scarlet.

756
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,732
Oh, forgive me.

757
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,665
I have taken
rather too much tea

758
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,499
and there is a room
I must visit before we leave.

759
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:31,932
Annie,

760
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:34,799
show Miss Scarlet
where she needs to go.

761
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,132
This carriage driver,
Pettifer,

762
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:45,232
the one who argued
with Mr. Harper Jones.

763
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:46,965
Did you know him?

764
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:49,000
Yes, ma'am.

765
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,066
Where might I find him?

766
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:00,832
I was their driver
for years-- whole family.

767
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:05,065
Jonathan Harper Jones, Thomas's
father, he was a good man.

768
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:07,300
Unlike his son.

769
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,132
I've known Thomas
since he was a boy.

770
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:13,499
You could tell he
was a wrong 'un.

771
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,432
Everyone knew it.

772
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,699
As I understand it,

773
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,399
the two of you had cross words
about something.

774
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,699
Yeah.

775
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,232
Well, that was
a few weeks back.

776
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,899
I was, um,

777
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,465
I was bringing the horse and
carriage round the front

778
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:29,399
of the house to take him
wherever he was going.

779
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,032
And I noticed that Samson--
that's the horse--

780
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:34,532
I noticed he was lame,
then Thomas,

781
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,232
he come rushing out,
saying he was late

782
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,232
and the horse'd be fine.

783
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:39,332
I said, "No, sir.

784
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,599
That horse needs
medical attention."

785
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,065
Well, he didn't care,
he was drunk already.

786
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,365
He pushed me out the way,
jumped in the driver's seat,

787
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:47,565
and rode off;
the next morning,

788
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:49,465
I noticed the carriage was back
in the stables

789
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,932
still attached
to poor old Samson.

790
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:55,465
His leg was worse--
it was bleeding badly.

791
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:58,266
And as for the carriage, well,
it was all bent and buckled.

792
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:02,799
Poor old Samson, he had,
he had to be destroyed.

793
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,132
That's when I knew I couldn't
work for him no longer.

794
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:09,365
You believe he hit something
with the carriage?

795
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:11,599
Or someone.

796
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,299
You say this was
a few weeks ago.

797
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,833
When, exactly?

798
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:33,932
What on Earth
are you doing?

799
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:35,665
Don't worry,
I'll, I'll clean it up.

800
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,465
You most certainly will,
young lady.

801
00:42:38,466 --> 00:42:39,899
What are you doing?

802
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,532
I was looking for Father's
old newspapers.

803
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,599
He usually keeps them
for at least a month.

804
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,065
He says they are an invaluable
source of reference.

805
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:47,265
And did you know, many crimes

806
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:48,599
are reported to journalists
before the police?

807
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,399
Do you know that you've
a piece

808
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,033
of moldy bread
in your hair?

809
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,399
I've searched the house

810
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,799
and couldn't find
any old papers anywhere.

811
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,399
I wondered if perhaps
they'd been thrown out.

812
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,265
Well, I told him to keep them
at work.

813
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:02,599
I got fed up with them
cluttering up the place.

814
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:12,932
I'll ask Thomas Harper Jones
to come in for an interview.

815
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:15,099
He's probably taken steps
to shore up his alibi,

816
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,499
but the more lies there are,
the more cracks can appear.

817
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,799
What do you think
the connection is

818
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,765
to the dead Mr. Wallis?

819
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,465
I'm not sure-- I'll need
a full statement from you,

820
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:25,833
outlining everything you saw.

821
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,266
What on Earth...?

822
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:35,265
What has she done now?

823
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:36,733
What is it?

824
00:43:38,266 --> 00:43:41,099
"Meet me here. Lizzie."

825
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,499
Where, exactly?

826
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:48,899
Whoa! Here we go.

827
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:55,332
There'd better be a damn
good reason for this.

828
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:58,266
There is, I assure you.

829
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,565
Mr. and Mrs. Samaris

830
00:44:02,566 --> 00:44:04,965
are originally from the island
of Cyprus.

831
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:06,865
Mr. Samaris doesn't speak
any English,

832
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:08,365
but his wife
has been good enough

833
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:11,632
to translate our conversation.

834
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:14,832
A few weeks ago, Mr. Samaris was
on his way back from work

835
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:17,565
when he was hit by a horse
and carriage in the street.

836
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:21,199
It was late, no one was around,
and the carriage didn't stop.

837
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,065
The police were unable
to find the driver,

838
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:26,099
as you'll have read
in the newspaper article

839
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,565
I left on your desk.

840
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:29,065
He is crippled.

841
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,765
That is why we went
to the detective.

842
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:33,032
Arthur Wallis?

843
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,332
Hm.
Exactly.

844
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,965
Mr. Wallis was kind enough
to waive his initial fee.

845
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,365
Payment would be made only

846
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:40,132
if the culprit was brought
to justice.

847
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:43,099
And did your husband see the man
that was driving that carriage?

848
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,565
Yes.

849
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:46,199
He gave a description
to the police,

850
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,965
but they didn't do anything.

851
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:54,400
He says, "This is the man
in the photograph."

852
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:58,732
- This photograph.
- Yeah.

853
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:01,533
Of Thomas Harper Jones.

854
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,965
And it is my belief

855
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:07,399
that Mr. Wallis found
Harper Jones and confronted him

856
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,399
with the threat of reporting him
to the police.

857
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,966
And that...

858
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:16,265
...is why
Harper Jones murdered him.

859
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,699
My clever girl.

860
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,099
Five guineas he tried
to charge me.

861
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,599
So I said to him,

862
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,332
"Do you have any idea
who my family is?"

863
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,265
Well, that shut him up.

864
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,300
Thomas
Harper Jones?

865
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:44,965
What is it now?

866
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:47,599
I have a few more
questions for you.

867
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,399
Well, it's not
a convenient time.

868
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,066
This is not a request.

869
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,365
Have you finished
your witness statement?

870
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:21,332
Just checking
for spelling mistakes.

871
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,732
I wish you'd been this dedicated
to your schoolwork.

872
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,699
So, we searched the
Harper Jones' Mayfair residence.

873
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,632
He had the Samaris case file

874
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:30,232
that Arthur Wallis
was working on.

875
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,432
In it, he names Harper Jones
as a suspect, so,

876
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:34,532
that, combined with William's
eyewitness account,

877
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,999
may be enough
to secure a conviction.

878
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,399
May be?

879
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,832
He'll have the best lawyers
money can buy.

880
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:44,165
Nothing's guaranteed.

881
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:48,099
So... What now?

882
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,099
Um...

883
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,799
Well, we'll arrange
a line-up of suspects.

884
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,665
I'll ask William
to formally...
No, I mean,

885
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,499
what now for me?

886
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,466
Surely this proves
where my abilities lie.

887
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:08,199
Never, not for one moment, did I
doubt your ability, Lizzie.

888
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,432
You are tenacious,

889
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:12,532
and resourceful, and every bit

890
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:15,133
as capable as any man here.

891
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,766
But your opinion remains
unchanged.

892
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:26,232
My opinion doesn't matter.

893
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,432
It's the rest of the world
that's the problem.

894
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:30,565
Who knows what will happen
in the future?

895
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:32,365
But, for now...

896
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:35,232
This is not the path
that I can follow.

897
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,066
I'm so sorry.

898
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:19,632
Good morning.

899
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,199
William,
good morning.

900
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,132
I heard you were going back
to college.

901
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,832
I thought I'd come
and say goodbye.

902
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,499
They've agreed to give me
a second chance.

903
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,199
Third, actually.

904
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,299
I was just looking
for some books to take,

905
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,132
but I found this instead.

906
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:35,865
Hm, I didn't know you had a dog.

907
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:37,666
Not anymore-- he died.

908
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,399
Do you mind
if I carry on packing?

909
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,499
I have a train to catch.

910
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,365
No, no, carry on.

911
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,232
So, I hear you found
somewhere to live.

912
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:52,599
Hm, it's a lodging house in...
Stepney?

913
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,965
Your father paid
the first month's rent.

914
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:57,265
I, I said
I'd pay him back when I can.

915
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:59,232
Shouldn't be too long,
hopefully.

916
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:00,632
I've got a meeting with
the recruiting sergeant

917
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:01,999
this afternoon.

918
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,365
The recruiting sergeant?

919
00:49:03,366 --> 00:49:05,932
I'm thinking about
joining the police.

920
00:49:05,933 --> 00:49:08,165
Your father said he'd put in
a word for me.

921
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,632
You're joining the police?

922
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:13,665
I still don't know
if I actually will,

923
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,499
but they say
the money's quite good.

924
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,032
God knows what I'll look
like in the uniform.

925
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:22,499
Oh, this damn thing!

926
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,832
Here, let me.
No, I'm more than capable of
doing it myself, thank you.

927
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,399
Have I upset you?

928
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,199
No, it's just this... dog.

929
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,700
Just this, this,
this stupid, damn dog!

930
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,166
It's not fair, William,
it's not fair.

931
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,432
Please, just...

932
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:49,933
Stop crying.

933
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:01,565
Lizzie! Come on, young lady!

934
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,932
You'll be late!

935
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:07,333
I must be going--
Miss Scarlet.

936
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,165
Are you all right?

937
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,733
Yes-- quite well, thank you.

938
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:00,465
William?

939
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,565
William!

940
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,265
I need a drink.

941
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:17,899
I'll get you some water.

942
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:21,565
I was thinking
more a double whisky.

943
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,099
Oh, what have I gone
and done to myself now?

944
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,900
Here, shh.

945
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,799
You've had us all
so worried, William.

946
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,165
I've been coming every day
to see you,

947
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,799
to sit with you,
hoping you'd wake up.

948
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,232
And now you, and now you have!

949
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,965
Oh, my, listen to me going on--
how are you feeling?

950
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:46,400
If you'd, if you'd just
let me speak...

951
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,733
It's good to hear your voice,
William.

952
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:55,432
It's... good indeed!

953
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,532
Can I get you
some more water?

954
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,399
I prefer whisky.

955
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,033
You're not having whisky.

956
00:52:04,133 --> 00:52:06,399
Is this comfortable?

957
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,900
Not particularly,
when you do that.
I'm sorry.

958
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:19,432
I arrived this morning
to be greeted

959
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:20,899
by a most pleasant surprise.

960
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,332
Bonjour, Eliza.

961
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,665
I leave you a business
that is thriving

962
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:26,232
and come back to find it
barely surviving!

963
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,865
I'm in no rush to go back.

964
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:29,232
That job is everything to you.

965
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,365
Not everything.
