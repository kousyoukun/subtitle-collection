1
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,506
You lose everything, my girl.

2
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,360
So you've said - four times.

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,120
I definitely had
it on yesterday.

4
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:25,785
Your gloves, your keys, that
handkerchief I embroidered for you

5
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,168
Everything!

6
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,280
Five times.

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,920
Miss Scarlet?
- Yes.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,390
I'm Miss Scarlet.

9
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,880
May I inquire if
you've lost something?

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,530
Some jewellery perhaps?

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,130
Yes, my mother's wedding ring.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,840
Have you found it?

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,656
Does your ring have
an inscription?

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,720
From my father to my mother 'For
my beloved, Livinia Scarlet'

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,370
Then it is yours.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,760
I told you so many times to get
it resized, but does she listen?

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,392
It was found last night in the
city mortuary by a Mr Potts.

18
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:01,798
Is she the one that calls you

19
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,235
an unchristian woman the
morals of an alley cat.

20
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,490
Yes, that's the one.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,330
You're under arrest.

22
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:10,709
What? Why?

23
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:13,180
For breaking and entering
the city mortuary.

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,940
Find Inspector Wellington.

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,900
Duke, the door.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Hmm.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,420
Duke.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,730
It's your house, you get it.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,640
Sorry to bother you,

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,090
but I wondered if Inspector
Wellington was there.

31
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,850
You've got a visitor.

32
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,959
Inspector Wellington!

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,780
I need your help.

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
It's Eliza.

35
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,166
She's been arrested.

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,550
Tell her it's my day off.

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,060
Who is this Eliza?

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,350
She's not my wife.

39
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Ready inspector?

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,830
Miss Scarlet really
does need your help.

41
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:23,430
There's clearly been a
misunderstanding Detective Phelps.

42
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,530
Not that I wish to tell
you how to do your job.

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,870
You being an extremely
experienced, well regarded officer,

44
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm simply perplexed as
to what has happened.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,940
Well, let me enlighten
you, Miss Scarlet.

46
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,290
Last night someone smashed the window
of the city mortuary and broke in.

47
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,740
They then gained access
to the clerical office

48
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,350
inside and stole some
highly confidential files.

49
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,520
Well, if that is true

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,276
then it's both deplorable
and a disgrace.

51
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:56,923
Words shared by the clerk
of the mortuary, Mr Potts,

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,670
although in his case he used them to
describe you rather than the situation.

53
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,246
I know that man's opinion of me.

54
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:04,122
'An unscrupulous woman'

55
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,030
'who is as trustworthy
as a bag of snakes'.

56
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,680
The fact is, I'm no thief.

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,020
So glad you brought up
facts, Miss Scarlet,

58
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,420
because the fact
remains that your ring

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,810
was found at the crime scene.

60
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,500
Well, I have no idea
how it got there.

61
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,220
Women aren't even allowed in
the mortuary - quite right too.

62
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,820
It's no place for a lady.

63
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
Morning to you.

64
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,960
I'll take you from
here Detective Phelps.

65
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,830
Thank God for that.

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,606
I'm sorry to have dragged
you into this, William.

67
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,100
On my day off.

68
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,970
Oh. Were you doing
something nice?

69
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,070
I have no idea how my mother's ring
found its way to the crime scene.

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,679
It's a puzzle indeed.

71
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,957
Do you think I was
born yesterday?

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,950
I'm warning you, Eliza.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,340
The next words out of your
mouth better be the truth

74
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,130
or I'll take you down
to the cells myself.

75
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,720
All right. I did go to
the mortuary yesterday.

76
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,530
I have numerous outstanding
cases which I could progress with

77
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,750
if Mr Potts would share some
basic information with me.

78
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,726
But he refuses to treat me
like a fellow professional.

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,160
So I have no choice but to
break in like a common criminal

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,440
and check the files myself.

81
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,496
I must have dropped my
mother's ring whilst there,

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,890
hence this misunderstanding.

83
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,385
So let me get this straight..

84
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,954
Last night you broke
into the city mortuary

85
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:29,186
and stole files
from Potts' office.

86
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,290
Where exactly is the
misunderstanding?

87
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,450
I never stole anything.

88
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,007
I looked at the files
and put them back.

89
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,159
And it wasn't last night,
it was yesterday afternoon

90
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,628
when Mr Potts was out for lunch.

91
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:40,416
And I didn't break in.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,680
Why would I want to have a key?

93
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:45,760
You duplicated a key
for the city mortuary?

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
What choice do I have?

95
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,830
Someone else broke into the mortuary
last night and it wasn't me.

96
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,765
I wouldn't lie to you, William.

97
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:55,460
That's a blatant lie in itself.

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,780
Miss Scarlet.
- Detective Fitzroy.

99
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
New haircut?

100
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,450
Very smart.

101
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,570
Sir, I have a message for you.

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,390
I thought I told you I wasn't
here. I'm on my day off.

103
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,620
Yes Sir, but the Superintendent
has asked for you.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
He says it's urgent.

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,290
Do not move.

106
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,110
William.

107
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
William..

108
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,640
You do believe me, don't you?

109
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,530
This is an extremely serious
offence that you're accused of.

110
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,910
It's going to be damn hard
to prove it wasn't you.

111
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,270
Come in!

112
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,080
Ah, Wellington. This
is Mr Thackeray.

113
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,130
Good morning, sir.

114
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,140
I hope it is a good
morning, Inspector..

115
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,620
It's been a bloody awful night,

116
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
that's for sure.

117
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,880
Mr Thackery is
the chief coroner.

118
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,898
The break in at city mortuary?

119
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:56,961
Break ins.

120
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,169
Plural. We've just had word that
the mortuaries in Kentish Town

121
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,580
and Swiss Cottage were
broken into last night.

122
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:04,727
Confidential files
stolen from each.

123
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,620
I believe you have the
perpetrator in custody.

124
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,010
We do indeed, Edmund.

125
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,890
That woman has a history
of breaking the law.

126
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,050
My man in the city has had to
deal with her time and time again,

127
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,560
but this time
she's gone too far.

128
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,640
The lady detective..

129
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,271
What nonsense.

130
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,990
So Miss Scarlet has had some
minor grievances with the clerk

131
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,456
who runs the city
mortuary service.

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,326
There was evidence found
at one of the crime scenes

133
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,401
that places her there.

134
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,948
Surely you are working
under the assumption

135
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:31,340
that whoever did one break in
must have done the other two.

136
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,105
Yes, that would be
the assumption, sir.

137
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,901
I want that woman
charged without delay.

138
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,129
It's all in hand.

139
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:39,892
Take Miss Scarlet directly to
Holloway. She can be kept there whilst

140
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,438
further investigations
are undertaken.

141
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,172
Further Investgation? What
need is there of that?

142
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,956
You've got all the
evidence you need. Fergus.

143
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,447
Charge her.
- But Sir..

144
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:48,751
That's an order, Inspector.

145
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,030
Yes, Sir.

146
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Sorry, Eliza.

147
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,430
Where is she?

148
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,410
I wish I knew so I could
give her a piece of my mind.

149
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,110
She does nothing but
worry the life out of me.

150
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,730
Not only is she now a fugitive,

151
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,700
but she's also made a
complete fool out of me again.

152
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,390
I'm as frantic to
find her as you are.

153
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,790
God knows where she is.

154
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,850
God knows what danger she's in.

155
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,580
Well, not as much danger as she'll
be when I get my hands on her.

156
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,230
Please do not talk
like that Inspector,

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,020
it's not gentlemanly.

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,890
Do you have any idea how
much trouble she's in?

159
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,850
Then you must help her.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,990
How can I when I don't
know where she is?

161
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,036
There was one person who
might know her whereabouts

162
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,290
and I have my men hunting
him down as we speak.

163
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,900
If Moses so much as sneezes,

164
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,700
we will be down on him
like a ton of bricks.

165
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,210
What makes you think
Moses knows anything?

166
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,100
Those two are thick as thieves?

167
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,330
If you see her or
you hear from her,

168
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,490
then you send for
me Ivy, immediately.

169
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
Are you sure you
weren't followed?

170
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,190
Why do people
always ask me that?

171
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,550
I'm worried about my girl.

172
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,970
Are you certain this is
the right thing to do?

173
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,970
Just stick to the plan.

174
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't think I can do it.

175
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,590
You just lied to the
Detective Inspector.

176
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,860
You can do this.

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Gone.

178
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,438
Gone where?

179
00:09:57,594 --> 00:09:58,594
I don't know sir.

180
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:02,031
So a prime suspect who was in
your custody has done a runner.

181
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,860
You're unable to
locate her, a woman.

182
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,590
She's a private detective, Sir.

183
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,460
She has contacts..
- Are you not one of them?

184
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,486
I can assure you that I've
had no hand in this, sir.

185
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,220
I can also assure you
that Eliza Scarlet

186
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,565
is not the perpetrator. We're
barking up the wrong tree.

187
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:15,604
Enough!

188
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,776
Now it seems to me
we have a conflict

189
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
of interest here,

190
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,750
so I'm going to recommend
you'll move to another case,

191
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,087
With all due respect, Sir,

192
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,020
that would be a mistake.

193
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,146
The chief coroner's a man
of connection and influence.

194
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,330
Whose going to make my
life extremely difficult.

195
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,510
Give me one more day, sir.

196
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,785
Now, I have not long been in this
job laddie and I can assure you

197
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,980
you do not want to be
the reason I lose it.

198
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
You have your day.

199
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,990
Find her!

200
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,230
Yes, Sir.

201
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,620
What a privilege it is
to have such a visit.

202
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,430
Not since Prince Albert himself

203
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,420
graced us to open
our new autopsy wing

204
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,282
have I been so honoured.

205
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,429
And the honour is
all mine, Mr. Potts.

206
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,766
I am merely here at the request
of my husband, Mr Thackery.

207
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:16,883
'Cecilia', he said. 'You
must pay Mr Potts a visit'

208
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:20,726
'and see is he quite well after
such a distressing episode'.

209
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:25,670
The notion of the chief coroner
giving an employee as lowly as myself

210
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:29,020
any thought is.. That's
comfort indeed, Mrs Thackery.

211
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,060
But this business, with the break-in
has left me feeling somewhat violated.

212
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,640
To think someone
came into this, my

213
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:40,820
private sanctuary
without authorization.

214
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,940
I say someone, but I know exactly
who it was and so do the police.

215
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,240
Yes, my husband told
me all about it.

216
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,027
Some young woman, was it not?

217
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,500
I hear she's a private investigator.
What a curious job for a lady.

218
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,380
There's nothing of the
lady about that woman.

219
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,640
What exactly was it she stole?

220
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,986
I thought you said your husband
told you all about it, Mrs Thackery?

221
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,090
He did indeed, but..

222
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,360
I have quite forgotten. Ah,
you know how us ladies are..

223
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,880
It's hard to retain too much
information at any one time.

224
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,110
I do not believe you.

225
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,850
It is abundantly clear to me
that a lady such as yourself

226
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,950
possesses great brains
as well as beauty.

227
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,190
You're kind, Mr. Potts.

228
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,836
But it is nevertheless true that
the details have quite evaded me.

229
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:41,430
Would you mind if we did
not discuss that woman?

230
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,410
I have to be mindful
of my blood pressure

231
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,740
and she has a habit of
causing me great vexation.

232
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:51,726
Tea.

233
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,450
Goodness, I'd quite forgotten
the reason for my visit.

234
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,160
My husband and I would like
to invite you for dinner.

235
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,570
This evening.

236
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,940
At the chief coroner's house?

237
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,130
And I will endeavour to keep
my questions to a minimum.

238
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,400
I'd hate to cause
undue vexation.

239
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,440
I... Mrs Thackery, nonsense...

240
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,920
What is it you wish to know?

241
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,070
Confidential files were stolen
from all three mortuaries.

242
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,350
They contained lists of unidentified
bodies who died 25 years ago

243
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,190
in the August of 1857.

244
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,300
Anything else taken?

245
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:39,950
We should let Eliza know.

246
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,099
Not yet.

247
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:43,531
She must lie low until
I've found out more.

248
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,880
Where exactly is this safe
house she's holed up in?

249
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,420
I hope it's respectable.

250
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,820
It's not exactly
Claridges, but it will do.

251
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,128
Oh my God.

252
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:00,815
Miss Scarlet,
welcome to my castle.

253
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,260
I hope you've made
yourself home.

254
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:03,612
Yes, yes.

255
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:06,560
Moses has shown me
all the amenities.

256
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
Thank you for allowing
me to shelter here.

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,810
I have allegations made against
me that are completely false.

258
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Aren't they always?

259
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,000
So what are these
false allegations?

260
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,020
It's a break in at
the city mortuary

261
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,255
and for your information
the claims are false.

262
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:25,614
On Bow Lane?

263
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:26,395
Mm..

264
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,660
My sister Clementine
works that steet?

265
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,840
Your sister's called
Clementine, too?

266
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,790
All my sisters are. Made it easy for
our mother to remember who's who..

267
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,391
If something happened
on my sister's patch

268
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:39,860
she'd know about it,
'orrible though she is.

269
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,220
I could pay her a visit though.

270
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,350
See if she knows anything.

271
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:45,868
I'd be most grateful.

272
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:46,971
How grateful?

273
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,650
I take great risk
in going to see her.

274
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,442
Last week she punched
a dog in the face.

275
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,550
This Moses is the key.

276
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,690
If anyone can lead
us to her, it's him.

277
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:12,804
Sir, I've got the information
that you asked for.

278
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,930
Get to it.

279
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,396
Did I say something wrong, Sir?

280
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
Shut the door first, Roy.

281
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,064
Now, I do not believe that
Miss Scarlet is guilty in this

282
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:27,748
but my orders are to find her,

283
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,685
not to go looking for
alternative perpetrators.

284
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,610
So this line of inquiry is to
remain strictly between us.

285
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,290
You have a problem
with that detective?

286
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,705
No, Sir.

287
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,323
I do not have a
problem with that.

288
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:44,378
Good.

289
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,530
And what have you got for me?

290
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,766
The files stolen from each
of the three mortuaries

291
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,530
contain a list of unidentified
bodies from August 1857.

292
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,146
Yes, yes, tell me
something I don't know.

293
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,250
Then I searched for a link,

294
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,830
male, female, similar ages,

295
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,910
cause of death,

296
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,361
but unfortunately those details only exist
in records at the cemeteries themselves,

297
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:02,605
but I managed to find
maps of each cemetery

298
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,006
and where the
graves are located.

299
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,319
I've marked them with an X.

300
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,670
How many cemeteries are there?

301
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,800
14 Sir, with one
pauper grave in each.

302
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:13,807
Shall I come with you, Sir?

303
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,280
No, I need to do this quietly.

304
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,260
Go back to your duties.

305
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,430
Yes, Sir.

306
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,770
Clementine, where have you been?

307
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,130
You've been gone for hours.

308
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,350
Did you see your sister?

309
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,491
What did she say?

310
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,186
Does she know anything
about the break-in?

311
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,120
Saw her.. very nice.. well..

312
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,233
Whatever..

313
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:41,315
Yeah, it wasn't very good since the
wrestling match with our grandmother.

314
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
She saw the real thief?

315
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,430
Clementine..

316
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Clementine.

317
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:49,977
Oh!

318
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,920
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

319
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,060
I'm calling the police!

320
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,110
Stop.

321
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,080
I'm a police officer, madam.

322
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Are you all right?

323
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,880
Just a little shaken, my
husband's the vicar here.

324
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,690
He's away on business.

325
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,830
I'm all alone.

326
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Poor soul.

327
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Those grave robbers,

328
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,380
they have no morals.

329
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,380
Do you know who's buried here?

330
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,890
No one knows.

331
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Pauper grave.

332
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,080
I was in my parlour
in the vicarage.

333
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:12,630
I like to carry out my
correspondence there.

334
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,965
So, what alerted
you to the robbers?

335
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:18,020
I was writing to
my sister Agatha,

336
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,180
I heard a noise outside.

337
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,940
We weren't expecting
any burials today.

338
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,660
My husband's away
on church business,

339
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,380
staying with the Archbishop
himself in Canterbury

340
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,260
So you heard a noise outside?

341
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,870
I went out to see what it
was and instantly I knew.

342
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,750
Body snatchers. It's a lucrative trade
selling corpses to the medical profession.

343
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,140
They supply bodies
for anatomy classes.

344
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:47,811
Dissections.

345
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:49,940
Yes, I am aware of the practice.

346
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,720
I shouted at them to stop.

347
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,760
They was so shocked that
someone was at the vicarage.

348
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,170
They must have assumed it empty.

349
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,580
Then they saw you, a man..

350
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,420
Had you not been
there inspector..

351
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,830
I dread to think what
might have happened.

352
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,020
You got a good look at them?

353
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,110
One had dark hair
and the other was..

354
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,150
Fairer?

355
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,940
Average build, the pair.

356
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,665
Any scars, tattoos
distinguishing features?

357
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,633
None that I saw but
they were very grubby.

358
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,730
Dirt all over their
faces, their hands.

359
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
I haven't been much help.

361
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,660
No, you've been most helpful.

362
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,940
See Mrs Ellis home.

363
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:49,597
Jake

364
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,581
There's been a
sighting: the Jamaican.

365
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:52,715
Do you want me to bring him in?

366
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:55,090
No. He's mine.

367
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:05,120
And a pound of
potatoes, please Jim.

368
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,920
Jim, right?

369
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,100
Right you are, young lady.

370
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,540
Mrs Thackery.

371
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,090
How nice to see you again.

372
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Mr. Potts..

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,900
What a small world?

374
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,120
Not really. Mother is
just around the corner.

375
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,130
Had to pay her visit to
impart my most wonderful news.

376
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:25,145
Oh?

377
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,676
The honour of dining with yourself
and the chief coroner this evening.

378
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:31,918
I said mother, I might just
purchase a new tie for the occasion.

379
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:32,950
This one's so special.

380
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:36,369
Mother would so love
to have joined us.

381
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:38,659
Well, bring her
along if you like.

382
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,160
Mrs Thackery, you
misunderstand me..

383
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,710
Mother is dead.

384
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,120
It is her grave which I visit.

385
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,840
I felt compelled to share the news
of this great honor bestowed upon me.

386
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,780
Well, I really should be going.

387
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,750
Dinner will not prepare itself.

388
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,083
I am more than a
little confused.

389
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:05,440
It's most unusual that a lady, such
as yourself, does her own shopping.

390
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,130
Indeed, however,
I wanted to ensure

391
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,200
that all the ingredients for tonight's
dinner were of the highest quality.

392
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
I don't know what to say.

393
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,460
Until this evening, then.

394
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:22,888
Until this evening.

395
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,050
What a delightful lady.

396
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,981
It is a treat to be in her
company. A treat indeed.

397
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,330
Yeah, Ivy is one in a million.

398
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:39,433
Ivy?

399
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Clementine,

400
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
Clementine.

401
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:53,667
I've just had the
loveliest dream.

402
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:57,059
Moses took me to Gilbert's, and
my God did he look handsome.

403
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,900
What did your sister
Clementine say?

404
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,148
Which one - there's five of us?

405
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:03,497
The one that witnessed the
break-in in the city mortuary.

406
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:07,630
Oh. Uh.. she said it
was raining that night

407
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,760
so she took shelter under
the arches near the mortuary.

408
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,946
That's when she saw him him.
- Him?

409
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:14,463
A man.

410
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,180
Yes, I've gathered that
but what did he look like?

411
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:20,071
Blackest of hair,
bluest of eyes..

412
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:22,461
A crooked smile that would
make the devil whimper.

413
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,960
Did she recognise him?

414
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,210
It's something I suppose.

415
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:31,082
Man, black hair, blue eyes.

416
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,695
You said she was
sheltering from the rain.

417
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:35,231
It wasn't raining that night.

418
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,695
In fact, it hasn't rained
for weeks and if it was dark,

419
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:39,345
how did she see
he had blue eyes?

420
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:41,165
She's got good eyesight.

421
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:42,995
You said she had
only one working eye.

422
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:46,777
You didn't go and see
your sister, did you?

423
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:47,836
You drank my money.

424
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:49,008
She's terrifying

425
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:51,640
When I was a girl she stole my
pet mouse and baked it in a pot.

426
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:53,367
I want my money back now.

427
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,823
I'd love to stay and chat
but I've got to get to work.

428
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:13,514
Where is she?

429
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:16,071
Grave robbers drink here.

430
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,171
I said where is she?

431
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:21,009
Let me go in, ask around,

432
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,044
see about those two who
were running from you.

433
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:24,897
How do you know about that?

434
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,359
You've been following me.

435
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,567
You're going... forget it, they
will smell police a mile away.

436
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:33,457
And why would you
want to help me?

437
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,251
We both know she's innocent

438
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:38,523
and those body snatchers
will lead to the real thief.

439
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,487
So I will help you help her.

440
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:46,777
For a fee, of course.

441
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,537
I don't work with criminals.

442
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,997
Shame Miss Scarlet
doesn't follow my example.

443
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:56,757
Good luck.

444
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:03,887
You're gonna need it.

445
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:17,527
Whiskey.

446
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:22,787
There you go.

447
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:24,927
Inspector.

448
00:24:39,697 --> 00:24:40,697
Eliza

449
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:50,597
Mr Potts..
- Do not bother Miss Woods.

450
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,737
It's your real name, is it not?

451
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:56,387
Miss Ivy Woods.

452
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:59,427
Yes. Yes it is.

453
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,982
And I'm so sorry to
have deceived you.

454
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:05,037
It was for a good reason.

455
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:08,287
That's never a good reason
to deceive, Miss Woods.

456
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:10,545
It comes as no surprise to me

457
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:11,945
that the lady who runs
the house with that woman

458
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,293
should herself be
unchristian in her ways.

459
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:18,270
I can assure you I don't
make a habit of lying.

460
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:22,043
I love that girl and I
do anything to help her.

461
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:26,117
I should never have believed
that the chief coroner

462
00:25:26,197 --> 00:25:29,607
would even consider inviting
someone like me for dinner.

463
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:33,447
He'd think I'd know my
place in the world by now.

464
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,467
And you haven't
learned Barnabas..

465
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,431
I really am very sorry Mr Potts.

466
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:40,759
I've never done anything
like this before.

467
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,939
Hah!

468
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:43,797
Take heart, Miss Woods.

469
00:25:45,017 --> 00:25:46,400
Because you had me fooled.

470
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:48,117
Good day.

471
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:57,014
Mr Potts, did you spend
money on a new tie?

472
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:10,327
Come on, cough up.

473
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,047
I think I'll take a lady
out with my winnings.

474
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:17,207
How about..

475
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:19,287
Your mum?

476
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:25,677
Who's there?

477
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:28,901
I'm looking for a
man about a job.

478
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:38,551
The kind that can make
you serious money.

479
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:42,557
Is business good?

480
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:46,307
Booming, mate. Be even better if
I weren't stuck with this ingrate.

481
00:26:47,597 --> 00:26:48,627
Get on with you.

482
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,707
Take them to the cells.
Keep them separate.

483
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,452
I'll question this one first.

484
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:13,312
I've done nothing!

485
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:14,500
Shut your mouth!

486
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:20,755
I do not like to be manhandled.

487
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:23,677
Best part of my
day, arresting you.

488
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:25,787
We need it to look real.

489
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:28,407
This was your idea.

490
00:27:30,037 --> 00:27:32,941
I got you your thief.
Now it's your turn.

491
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:35,778
Well, I'd like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you,

492
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:36,847
but you know I'd be lying.

493
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:41,247
More where that came from, if you
tell me where Miss Scarlet is.

494
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:46,777
I'll be watching you.

495
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:51,529
I'd expect nothing
less, Inspector.

496
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:57,637
Why is this Miss Scarlet
not in prison as we speak?

497
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,497
How has she evaded the entire
Metropolitan Police force?

498
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:02,156
I know it's not
ideal, but trust me.

499
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,133
You had this woman here

500
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:04,597
and she slipped
through your fingers.

501
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,514
Well, I've had enough of
this nonsense, Fergus.

502
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,187
I'm taking this up
with your superiors.

503
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,996
Edmund..
- Out of my way.

504
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,887
Sir, we have a
development in the case.

505
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:17,949
You have the woman
back in custody?

506
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,184
No, Sir, I have
something better.

507
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:27,257
So just to confirm, this is not the
woman who hired you to rob the grave

508
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,352
at Highgate Cemetery?

509
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:29,894
She was much older.

510
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:31,843
And this older woman is the same

511
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:34,907
as who you believe broke into
the three burgled mortuaries.

512
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:42,177
How do you know this?

513
00:28:43,837 --> 00:28:46,547
Because these nicked files
that you keep banging on about

514
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:49,293
- she had them. Paid us to
dig up every name on there.

515
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,514
When I say name the
graves didn't have any.

516
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,005
All of them pauper graves.

517
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:56,585
And what was she looking for?

518
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:58,632
Not a bleeding clue.

519
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,547
But whatever it was

520
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:03,662
all she found were
bags of bones.

521
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,077
So, what happened?

522
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,037
Tell me about this woman.

523
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:10,237
Name, age, appearance.

524
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:11,686
I don't know her name.

525
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:14,209
Only that they call her

526
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:15,709
Bloody Mary.

527
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:17,560
Been inside for years.

528
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:19,521
Newgate, I think.

529
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:23,151
And as for what she looked like,
well, you should know - you met her.

530
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:24,517
What?

531
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,213
When me and Watts did
a runner at Highgate

532
00:29:26,237 --> 00:29:29,603
We thought she was done for but the silly
tart couldn't run away in a dress, could she?

533
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:31,671
No, the only person I
met was the vicar's wife,

534
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,258
a Mrs Ellis.

535
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,254
That was no vicar's wife mate.

536
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:37,657
That was Bloody Mary.

537
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,210
Just so I'm clear,
crystal clear,

538
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:46,263
you had the perpetrator
in that very room

539
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:47,093
and you let her go.

540
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:47,945
Sir, I can only apolo..

541
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,371
This is very
disappointing laddie..

542
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:50,787
Clearly I should have stuck

543
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:52,817
with first instinct. I will
not make that mistake again.

544
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:53,504
Sorry..

545
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:55,591
Another officer will take
over the investigation.

546
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:56,615
Sir, that..

547
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:11,160
What happened here?

548
00:30:11,824 --> 00:30:13,120
Went to see my sister.

549
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:14,691
What, she did that?

550
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:17,754
I gave as good as I got. Actually
I think she came off worse.

551
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,587
Now, I have some information.

552
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:22,679
My sister did see the thief. It was
a woman, fair hair, black dress.

553
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,907
Old, very old, at least 50.

554
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:25,937
Did she recognise her?

555
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:28,627
Not a clue. Unlike the
constable from Scotland Yard

556
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:29,941
who drinks at my local.

557
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,065
How he loves the chat
when he's had a few.

558
00:30:32,357 --> 00:30:34,729
Reckon I'd make a good
lady detective myself.

559
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:36,607
Tell me everything you know.

560
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:41,607
I was just coming to get you.

561
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,405
She's a wily one,
that Clementine.

562
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:44,944
Remind me to employ
her more often.

563
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:46,423
Where are you going?

564
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:47,545
To solve the case.

565
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:49,403
But you have not been
working the case.

566
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:51,850
I have and I have news.

567
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,520
You're in the clear.

568
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:57,107
Come on Moses.

569
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,517
We've work to do.

570
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:06,617
So.

571
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:08,345
What did the vicar say?

572
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:10,400
What I expected.

573
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,345
He has no wife.

574
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:15,237
Where's the information
I requested?

575
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:20,207
Since you are officially
off the investigation,

576
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:21,672
I thought it safer
to memorise it

577
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:23,233
just in case I was stopped
coming out of the yard.

578
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:24,718
Don't get carried away, man.

579
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:25,993
But you are off the case, Sir?

580
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,203
I don't wish to talk about it.

581
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:28,353
It's all anyone can talk about.

582
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:29,377
Good for them.

583
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,367
If you would kindly
impart the information

584
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:34,127
that has been so carefully
concealed in that brain of yours

585
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:35,217
and hurry up about it.

586
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:37,547
This bloody Mary's real
name is Mary Dawson.

587
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:40,207
She was part of a gang of diamond
smugglers back in the 50s.

588
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:43,027
She served 25 years at Newgate,
was released last week.

589
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:45,427
What is it, Sir?

590
00:31:57,867 --> 00:32:00,338
Who sends flowers
to a pauper grave?

591
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:06,427
Yes, that particular grave receives
flowers each and every month.

592
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:08,613
Write down the address
of the sender for me.

593
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:09,882
Certainly, Inspector.

594
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:12,877
What?

595
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:14,677
Sorry Sir.

596
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,473
Have you ever been
taken off a case before?

597
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:19,663
I thought I made it clear that
I do not wish to talk about it.

598
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,317
You did Sir. Sorry,
Sir. Understood.

599
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:25,897
For what it's worth, Sir, the
officer Munro replaced you with is..

600
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:29,327
Sorry Sir, you do not
wish to talk about it.

601
00:32:29,757 --> 00:32:30,757
Thank you detective.

602
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:36,987
Who is it?

603
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:38,335
Carmichael, Sir.

604
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,172
Carmichael? Couldn't investigate
a booze up in a brewery, that one.

605
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:44,147
As requested, Sir.

606
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:47,237
Address of the account holder.

607
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:48,767
Thank you.

608
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:52,447
It's a curious thing, but you're not
the first person who has inquired

609
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:54,437
about that particular
account today.

610
00:32:54,927 --> 00:32:56,677
Who else has inquired about it?

611
00:32:57,307 --> 00:33:01,113
A lady. Blond hair
determined demeanour.

612
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:14,239
I don't know where to begin.

613
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,147
I can explain.

614
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,211
Don't bother.

615
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,487
See to it that Miss Scarlet
stays in the carriage.

616
00:33:21,637 --> 00:33:22,098
Yes, Sir.

617
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:23,657
Hello Miss Scarlet.

618
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:26,417
Do not converse with her or
let her out of your sight.

619
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:27,647
I'll deal with you later.

620
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,217
Inspector

621
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,127
I thought you'd been replaced
on the investigation.

622
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,120
And I thought sending flowers to
a grave listed in the stolen files

623
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:01,330
might have been something
that you would have mentioned.

624
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:02,393
No, it's merely a coincidence

625
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,768
that my connection
with that grave

626
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,537
should have dovetailed
with this investigation.

627
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,588
I've been in the force a
long time, Mr. Thackery

628
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,257
and in my experience,

629
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,727
a coincidence never holds
up to much scrutiny.

630
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,567
Well, in this
case, you're wrong.

631
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:17,027
It is a simple explanation,

632
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:19,103
However it's not something
I'm comfortable to speak of,

633
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:21,037
nor should I have to
explain myself to you.

634
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,457
Well, if you prefer, you can explain
yourself to Detective Carmichael,

635
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:26,477
who I believe
Superintendent Munro

636
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:28,577
has now assigned to this case.

637
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,968
And I can assure you he will
not be as discrete as I am.

638
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:38,187
The fact is.

639
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:42,457
I had a humble upbringing.

640
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:44,677
It was more than humble.

641
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:46,777
I was born in the workhouse.

642
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:49,427
It's something I don't
like to talk about.

643
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:54,107
And rarely reveal, particularly
being a man of such status,

644
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,305
but from a young age I was.

645
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:58,787
Utterly determined to
make something of myself,

646
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:00,133
and as you can see.

647
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:01,852
I was successful.

648
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:05,517
There were many people who
helped me along the way.

649
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:07,407
Not least of all, my wife.

650
00:35:08,747 --> 00:35:10,107
And for that I'm
forever grateful.

651
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:15,287
So in short,

652
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,037
my fate could have been
somewhat different.

653
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:22,966
And as a Christian man, and in
my position as chief coroner

654
00:35:23,397 --> 00:35:26,267
whenever I happen upon a pauper
grave, I like to send flowers.

655
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:27,907
It is a small kindness

656
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:30,697
and it helps me remember.

657
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:32,737
Remember?

658
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,196
There, but for the grace of God,

659
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:37,727
Go I.

660
00:35:41,547 --> 00:35:42,547
So.

661
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:47,317
Well, I appreciate
your candor, Sir,

662
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:51,647
but I'm afraid there's still some questions
that I need to ask regarding the case.

663
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:52,572
What, why?

664
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:53,597
Surely we're done here?

665
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:55,607
We're done when
I say we're done.

666
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:56,737
Mr Thackery.

667
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:16,597
How did you know I was here?

668
00:36:17,214 --> 00:36:20,534
Inspector Wellington specifically ordered
me not to converse with you, Miss Scarlet.

669
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:22,497
Very well.

670
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:25,636
Although I'm surprised that a
gentleman with impeccable manners,

671
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,363
such as yourself,
would be so rude,

672
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:28,687
I'm only following orders.

673
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,967
Please forgive me, I do hold
you in the highest regard.

674
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:36,425
I don't wish to get you
into trouble Detective.

675
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:39,839
By answering one simple question,
can you really do any harm?

676
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:46,253
The florist advised that you'd been asking
who sent the flowers to the pauper grave?

677
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:48,941
But I didn't speak
to the florist.

678
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,197
Moses got that
information to me.

679
00:36:51,672 --> 00:36:53,833
Well then, who was the blond
lady the florist spoke of?

680
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:58,445
No, I do not know this
Mary Dawson or Bloody Mary,

681
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,693
or whatever the
devil she's called.

682
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,413
I'm as anxious as you to get
this criminal into custody

683
00:37:01,437 --> 00:37:02,773
and find out what
the hell is going on.

684
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:04,857
And I've answered all
your questions inspector.

685
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:07,112
My wife and the maid will be
back from my errands soon.

686
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:09,240
I'd like you gone
before they return.

687
00:37:12,122 --> 00:37:15,794
You seem extremely keen to
get rid of me, Mr. Thackery.

688
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,497
Well, a reputation can be
undone by such a visit.

689
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:21,587
I do not want to be the
topic of idle gossip.

690
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:28,647
I thought you were alone.

691
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,655
No, that'll just be the maid.

692
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:36,237
The maid who's running
errands with your wife?

693
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:43,267
No, do not open
that door. Please!

694
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:52,237
Nice to see you
again, Inspector.

695
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,167
Put the revolver down Mary.

696
00:37:55,057 --> 00:37:56,417
I was about to say
the same to you.

697
00:37:57,797 --> 00:37:58,797
And if you don't,

698
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,687
I will shoot Mrs
Thackery in the head.

699
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,764
No, Mary, please,
please do not do this.

700
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:03,795
Shut up.

701
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:05,987
I'll deal with you later.

702
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:11,567
I said

703
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:14,300
put it down.

704
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,347
Kick it towards me.

705
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,399
Good.

706
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:40,155
But on second thoughts, I think
I'm gonna kill her anyway.

707
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,663
I would recommend
that you do not.

708
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,447
You know that using a
policeman's weapon is an offence.

709
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,217
Would you have preferred if I
had dispatched Detective Fitzroy?

710
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,595
My real name is Alfie Frampton.

711
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:28,134
Mary Dawson was my fianc�e.

712
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,247
We were small time crooks

713
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,595
but we managed to pull
off a diamond heist.

714
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:37,517
When can I see my wife?

715
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:38,927
She knows nothing
of any of this.

716
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:40,715
Get on with it.

717
00:39:43,897 --> 00:39:45,127
I took the diamonds and ran.

718
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:47,089
But Mary tracked me down.

719
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:48,182
She's like a..

720
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,370
Like a mad woman.

721
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:51,245
She was attacking
me. She was..

722
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,117
Desperate to get hold of them.

723
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:55,380
So I swallowed them.

724
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,606
You swallowed the diamonds?

725
00:39:58,327 --> 00:39:59,841
And in return she gave me this.

726
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:07,132
The police turned up after
a tip-off and arrested Mary.

727
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,703
But I managed to escape.

728
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:12,387
And with her inside.

729
00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:14,557
I saw a way out.

730
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,703
To leave her behind.

731
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:19,321
To leave my past behind.

732
00:40:21,427 --> 00:40:22,899
So I faked my own death.

733
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:25,962
You used the corpse from the
pauper's grave in Highgate.

734
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,735
That's why you sent
flowers to it each month.

735
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:30,507
Poor soul..

736
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:33,507
Whoever he was

737
00:40:35,707 --> 00:40:36,890
gave me a new life.

738
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:43,574
Frampton took the body
to one of their hideouts,

739
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,573
changed clothes with the man,

740
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:46,053
and then gave him a
cut down his cheek,

741
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,667
just like Dawson
had done to him.

742
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:51,491
I'm pretty sure he always told you that
he got that scar from the Crimea, Sir.

743
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:52,933
I'm not the only one
who believed him.

744
00:40:52,957 --> 00:40:54,163
He told everyone that.

745
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:59,247
I wasn't questioning
your judgment, Sir.

746
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:01,707
From her prison cell,

747
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:03,027
Mary Dawson read about the body

748
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,647
in the papers and assumed
it was that of her fianc�.

749
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,647
And then when she'd
served her time,

750
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:09,437
she went about tracking
down his grave.

751
00:41:11,197 --> 00:41:12,197
Come.

752
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,449
Detective Phelps
come and take a seat.

753
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:27,777
Continue.

754
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,703
Dawson believed that she
would find the diamonds

755
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:32,807
that Frampton had swallowed
in one of those graves.

756
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,217
But what she didn't know was that
he'd sold them to reinvent himself.

757
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:37,937
He put himself through
medical school,

758
00:41:38,027 --> 00:41:39,357
he changed his whole life.

759
00:41:39,855 --> 00:41:41,417
Whiskey, detective Phelps.

760
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:45,497
Thank you Sir.

761
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:49,517
What of your friend,
Miss Scarlet?

762
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:52,152
Thackery wanted to pin this on
her at the earliest opportunity

763
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,971
in the hope that the trail
would end there and then.

764
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:58,121
If Dawson did find him, then
he would cut a deal with him.

765
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,883
Well, I think I'm fully briefed.

766
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,086
That will be all,
Inspector Wellington.

767
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,547
Sir, I know that I disobeyed
orders by continuing with the case.

768
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:10,297
That will be all Inspector.

769
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:14,137
Yes, Sir.

770
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:17,101
Well, detective Phelps.

771
00:42:17,923 --> 00:42:19,881
I've heard nothing but
good reports about you.

772
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:21,483
Tell me more about yourself.

773
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:24,467
We're always on the look
out for a good loyal man.

774
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:25,697
Yes, Sir.

775
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:28,727
Thank you, Sir.

776
00:42:36,507 --> 00:42:37,507
How childish men are.

777
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:40,667
Still, he'll get over it.

778
00:42:41,277 --> 00:42:42,307
No, he won't.

779
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:44,314
Loyalty is everything
to men like Munro,

780
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:45,607
and I disobeyed an order.

781
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:47,674
Oh, so this is my fault?

782
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:49,963
Actually, yes.

783
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:53,537
I was the one who saved
Mrs Thackey's life

784
00:42:53,627 --> 00:42:55,287
and most probably yours, too.

785
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:01,955
So I hear you and Moses
made quite the partnership.

786
00:43:03,627 --> 00:43:04,627
First of many.

787
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:08,988
I'm just teasing you, William.

788
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:10,949
But I don't - you know
- I don't like him.

789
00:43:15,207 --> 00:43:16,749
Now, I should get back to work.

790
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,421
It's probably a good idea,

791
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,020
trying to get back into the
superintendent's good books.

792
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:25,393
Eliza, will you at least pretend
that you say that for my sake,

793
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:26,797
rather than your own benefit?

794
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,861
William, you really do have a
low opinion of me sometimes.

795
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:31,080
Only sometimes?

796
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,407
So any plans for this evening?

797
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,232
Well, I did have

798
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:43,745
till Ivy buggered them up.

799
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,327
Oh yes, Betsy wasn't it?

800
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:48,497
