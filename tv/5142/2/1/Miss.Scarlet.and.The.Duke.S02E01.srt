1
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,983
Lord Billingdon

2
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:38,030
Miss Scarlet

3
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,710
I apologize for disturbing your evening.

4
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,130
However, I wanted to inform
you that I found them.

5
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,260
You found them.

6
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:46,638
My babies.

7
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:51,040
I am most impressed.

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,287
I must admit I wasn't entirely
convinced you had it in you.

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,264
Well, as promised when you engaged
me I offer a highly professional service.

10
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:01,470
I shall fetch my man.

11
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:02,960
He will take you home.

12
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:05,104
Lord Billingdon

13
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,527
The matter of my fee...

14
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:11,620
I shall send payment
to your office on Friday.

15
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:13,360
May I ask why not now?

16
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:14,910
Because it is not convenient.

17
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,500
Our contract clearly states
payment in full on delivery.

18
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,310
I have daughters your age.

19
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:26,920
If they spoke to me
in that kind of fashion.

20
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:29,591
They would be
reprimanded at once.

21
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,040
You will be paid at a time
agreeable for me, young lady.

22
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,400
Now I bid you goodnight.

23
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:52,300
In heavens name.

24
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:10,070
You would not dare.

25
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:54,308
Beautiful.

26
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:03,546
Good morning.

27
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,077
Oh!

28
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,410
What is that smell?

29
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,887
Never mind that.

30
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,707
I've been stuck here
all night, William.

31
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,512
Where have you been?
- At home..

32
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,500
..asleep where you should have been..

33
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,250
..but apparently you chose
to disturb the peace instead.

34
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:21,580
but it has been three weeks
since the last arrest,

35
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:23,743
so I suppose this
is progress of sorts.

36
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,530
Lucky for you the
cells were all full.

37
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,590
Oh, yes, I'm feeling
extremely lucky.

38
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,490
What is that smell?

39
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
Manure.

40
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,487
I've had little experience of allotments,

41
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:37,830
but after searching through at least 50
for those damn pigeons,

42
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:38,854
I'm now quite the expert.

43
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,557
You'd be surprised the
variety of manure used,

44
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,480
most of which ended up on my dress.

45
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:47,320
Well, those pigeons
would have certainly ruined

46
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,200
such expensive velvet curtains.

47
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:50,542
You'll have to pay a fine.

48
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:52,670
It's so unjust.

49
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:55,415
I've been in this business long
enough to know that I'm good at it it.

50
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,285
Yet why do I still struggle to
attract more illustrious cases?

51
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,243
You asking me or blaming me?

52
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,314
Just so I'm clear before I answer.

53
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:04,836
I'm simply pointing out that trying
to build a successful agency

54
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,400
would not be as hard if I were a man.

55
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,160
Being a man has its
disadvantages, too.

56
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,464
Oh, really, such as?

57
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,940
I promise by the time we dine tomorrow,

58
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,820
I would have thought of
at least half a dozen.

59
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,950
Four dinners in as many weeks.

60
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,310
People will begin to gossip.

61
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Let them.

62
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:36,070
We're just two old friends
enjoying an evening out.

63
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,595
I should get on. I have an
important meeting to prepare for.

64
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,423
How's the new Superintendent?

65
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:48,010
Yes, and I'm determined to be
in accord with him

66
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,529
a damn site more than I was
with the last, God rest his soul.

67
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:53,650
Don't be too effusive with him, William.
It doesn't suit your face.

68
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,191
Are you saying that I'm ill
tempered much of the time?

69
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:01,100
I'm simply saying that your natural
disposition is not one of enthusiasm.

70
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,423
You are measured.
How does that sound?

71
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,000
Like you're trying to placate me.

72
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,170
I've told you he's very busy man

73
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,660
so I suggest you calm down and stop
making a spectacle of yourself.

74
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,910
Sir, this lady's insisting
on talking with you,

75
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,050
but I tried to tell her you have
other matters to attend to.

76
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,346
You're Inspector Wellington?

77
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,946
You're the one who's cast my sister
aside like some dirt on your shoe.

78
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,160
Please calm yourself Madam.

79
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,760
You've done nothing to find her
yet you close the case.

80
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,330
If this is regarding an investigation,

81
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,100
you need to speak
with the desk Sergeant.

82
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,518
You were in charge of her case,
and yet you found nothing.

83
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,825
How can that be?

84
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,085
Get her out of here, Charlie.

85
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,830
Christ, Inspector Wellington.

86
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
Do you remember the kids?

87
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,220
Right now I'm more
concerned about him.

88
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,230
Who is it?

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,950
The new Superintendent.

90
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,370
Come.

91
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,990
Good morning, Sir.

92
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,790
I just wanted to come by
and introduce myself. I'm Inspect...

93
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,270
I know exactly who you are.

94
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,790
I wanted to apologise for the
scene that you've just witnessed, Sir

95
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,120
and to assure you that it's
not regular occurrence.

96
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,010
No need to apologise.

97
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
Take a seat, laddie.

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,550
The general public, have no idea
the volume of cases we have

99
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,090
to attend to week in and week out.

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,510
There's always going to be someone
unsatisfied with our service.

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Yes, Sir.

102
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,210
You know it's good to hear that one of
my own men is from the old hometown.

103
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,900
You're from Glasgow, Sir?
- Dragged up in the tenements. You?

104
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,770
Workhouse.

105
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:43,663
It's a long time ago.

106
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:45,327
So.

107
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:46,810
My predecessor..

108
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,610
I hear you two
didn't see eye to eye.

109
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:52,510
Let's just say that he was
from a different world to us.

110
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,400
Stuck up prig, aye?

111
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,570
Aye, it's slow job to
pull your way up

112
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,240
unless you've been born with a
silver spoon in your giggy.

113
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,124
Yet here you are Sir.

114
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:04,588
Here I am.

115
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,970
Now, I was fortunate.

116
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:10,257
I'd good governors
that championed me.

117
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,440
So I'd like to do the
same for my own men,

118
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,768
which is why I brought a couple
with me here to the Met,

119
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,510
and I expect you to
show them the ropes,

120
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:19,049
Wellington take them under your wing.
Absolutely Sir.

121
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,355
Good.

122
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,126
Game for another?

123
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:24,843
There's always time for another Sir.

124
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:26,276
Slainte!

125
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,907
Slainte!

126
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:43,610
Miss Scarlet!
Miss Scarlet!

127
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,240
Goodness, you walk fast.

128
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:46,640
Have we met.

130
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,180
It's Hattie, Hattie Parker.
Rupert's cousin.

131
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:52,704
Oh, of course Rupert mentioned you
were staying with his mother,

132
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,272
although that was a while ago.

133
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,220
I haven't received a letter
in some weeks.

134
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:57,568
That is why I'm here.

135
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Rupert has written to you
but mistakenly

136
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,081
used my aunts address.

137
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:02,699
I hid it quickly before she saw.

138
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,195
I do adore my cousin

139
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,210
but he is absent minded
at the best of times.

140
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,070
Well he's a newly married man and
that's no doubt keeping him busy.

141
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,281
I gather it's the night-time
amusements and the violin.

142
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,630
They keep him busiest.

143
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:17,850
How is your aunt?
- On the warpath.

144
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,950
Oh dear, what's up with her now.

145
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:21,263
You.

146
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,825
I didn't make Rupert go to Germany.

147
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,877
I certainly had no hand
in this marriage of his.

148
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:27,550
That is what I told her.

149
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,440
But Harriet she said,
what do you know about anything?

150
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:33,430
You are stupid, stupid girl without
one ounce of common sense.

151
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:38,330
Rupert mentioned your father died.

152
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,430
I'm so sorry.

153
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,790
I know what it is to lose
someone so dear.

154
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,700
It was just Papa and I for so long.

155
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:47,970
But now he has gone.

156
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,310
I am to be my aunt's companion.

157
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,366
Well, it was very nice
to meet you Miss Parker,

158
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,670
but I really should get to work.

159
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,580
Oh yes, your investigation agency.

160
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,040
I've heard all about it.

161
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,780
What you are doing is quite
marvellous, Miss Scarlett.

162
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:06,290
Perhaps you'd like to come to tea..
- Today?

163
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:08,990
Maybe not today..
- Tomorrow?

164
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,300
How about Wednesday, 4 o'clock?

165
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:12,464
Splendid!

166
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,340
Thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Until Wednesday..

167
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:40,772
Moses

168
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:44,310
Can you please stop
breaking into my office?

169
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,410
I like to keep you on your toes.

170
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,370
It's good for business.

171
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,150
Speaking of business.

172
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Did you get it?

173
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,420
He tried to hold back
some of your fees.

174
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:57,560
And I can't have this
ruined evening suit.

175
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,627
What a lot of fuss over
a few pigeon droppings.

176
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,331
But I reasoned with him.

177
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:03,960
Well, you were clearly
very persuasive.

178
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,240
If that's what you want to call it.

179
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,980
How's your lad in Scotland Yard?
Irritating.

180
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:13,260
I think it's your inspector bailed you out.

181
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:14,940
He's not my inspector.

182
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,520
Don't get too comfortable.

183
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,680
This is no lodging house.

184
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,470
I may have a case for you.

185
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,092
Make yourself at home.

186
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:24,810
So what is this case?

187
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,390
There is a landlord
in Whitechapel.

188
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,670
He has a guest
at his boarding house.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,730
They were looking for the services
of a private detective.

190
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,350
What's their name?

191
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,350
Miss Alice Lee.

192
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,610
I'm sorry you saw
me in that state.

193
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:48,410
Such was my rage.

194
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,630
I have no recollection

195
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
You were even there.

196
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,152
All I saw was him.

197
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:53,278
That man..

198
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:57,022
Who has the gall to close my sister's
case without a by-your-leave.

199
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,406
Miss Lee.

200
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:00,820
I know this is no excuse,

201
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,640
but Inspector Wellington
has a great many cases to deal with.

202
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,390
In fact he most likely had little
to do with this investigation,

203
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,971
but rather his men carried it out.

204
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,878
Inspector Wellington
signed the case closed.

205
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,080
He's the one to answer for it.

206
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,370
So tell me about your sister.

207
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:20,270
Georgina is the sweetest girl.

208
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:23,730
Our parents are both dead
so all we have is each other.

209
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:28,070
I was so worried when she said she
wanted to come to London to work.

210
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,290
I tried to stop her.

211
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:32,830
I didn't think she could cope
in the city or prove me wrong.

212
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,720
She got a job in a
shop - Wentworths.

213
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:37,910
Well, that's not just a shop.

214
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:40,926
Wentworth's is the best
department store in the West End.

215
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:43,926
Three months ago.

216
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:45,470
Her letters stopped.

217
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:49,820
I became so worried that I travelled down
from Yorkshire to see her.

218
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:53,030
I went straight to the store
but was told.

219
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,205
She no longer worked there.

220
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,564
One day she just didn't turn up.

221
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,080
They assumed she got another job.

222
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,670
So you went to the police.

223
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,080
I filled out a missing persons form.

224
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:08,770
And then last week I got a letter
to say the case was closed.

225
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,604
They found nothing.

226
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:13,729
Will you help me?

227
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:16,174
Please.

228
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:30,220
My heart goes out to poor Miss Lee,

229
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,990
but offering my services
will not go down well with William.

230
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,196
No matter the rights
of the wrongs of the case.

231
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,438
You'd humiliate him in front
of his new superintendent.

232
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:38,813
Dilemma, indeed.

233
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,610
If you wish to have some kind of future
with Inspector Wellington,

234
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,430
you need to start considering
what cases you take..

235
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,778
..ones that don't undermine his reputation.

236
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,116
Who says I wish to
have a future with him?

237
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:52,015
Or evenings out since...

238
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,109
I had no idea you
were keeping count.

239
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:57,046
We're just old friends, Ivy.

240
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:58,580
Then have some loyalty,

241
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,970
find this woman, someone else
to take her case - and keep still.

242
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:05,460
Fine, you're right.

243
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:08,180
I will find Miss Lee
an alternative investigator.

244
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:14,624
I know that looks easy.
Innocent as a lamb..

245
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,840
but there's always
the devilment of a 'but'.

246
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:21,308
But

247
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:24,360
First, I will gather
the basic information.

248
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,786
That way if there is anything
that William has overlooked,

249
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,900
I may tell him before
someone reopens the case.

250
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,650
It's the act of a friend, Ivy.

251
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:33,000
How selfless of you.

252
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,786
On occasion I have the need to run, so
I'd like my hemline little higher, please.

253
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,440
Over my dead body. You
are not showing your ankles.

254
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:08,801
Good morning Miss.

255
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:09,990
Yes Madam.

256
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,015
How can I help?

257
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,255
Why, I was hoping you might
have a spare moment to talk.

258
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:15,140
About what?

259
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:16,317
Georgina Lee.

260
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,660
I'm working for her sister.

261
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,930
I'm a private detective.

262
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,430
You're what?

263
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,590
Do you have a few moments?

264
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,200
Welcome to Wentworth, Madam.

265
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,120
The Pandora's box
of the West End.

266
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:28,860
I trust Miss Yates is serving you
to your satisfaction.

267
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,910
She's no customer, Mr Salisbury.

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,100
She's a private detective
asking questions about Georgina.

269
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,600
This is a department store, Madam.

270
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,090
If you're not intending to buy anything,
I would like you to leave.

271
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:41,875
It will not take long, it's it's mainly
a few questions that I seek...

272
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,130
It looks like I'll have
to see you out myself then.

273
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,520
This way please

274
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,262
Mr Salisbury.

275
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,010
What on Earth is going on here?

276
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,590
I apologise, Mrs Wentworth,

277
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,270
I was attempting to ask
this lady to leave.

278
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:56,735
If she is a lady.

279
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:59,050
Apparently she's a private detective.

280
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,382
She's a what?

281
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:04,531
Thank you.

282
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,810
I apologize for our Mr Salisbury.

283
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,330
He can be a little enthusiastic.

284
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:10,130
I do not wish to cause
any trouble.

285
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,610
It's merely a few questions I seek
on behalf of Miss Lee.

286
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:15,910
Ohh, that poor woman must be out
of her mind with worry.

287
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,910
Georgina was such a sweet girl.

288
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,140
Customers loved her.

289
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,370
Her absence is a loss to the store.

290
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,182
And you do not have any idea
where she might have gone?

291
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,659
Well, yes, we assumed she
found a position elsewhere

292
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,390
and this is what you told the police.

293
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,014
Well the police didn't come to
speak to me or to my husband.

294
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:33,842
And I'm glad of it.

295
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,817
What with my wife's
current condition

296
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,806
and I must say we weren't aware there
was even an investigation

297
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,870
until speaking with you.

298
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,870
What, the police didn't come to the store.

299
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:44,112
They didn't speak to you
or the other shop girls?

300
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:45,136
No.

301
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
No one did.

302
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:55,100
I know you've been under the
command of Superintendent Munro

303
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:57,095
and I have no doubt he
has the highest standards.

304
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,640
but different forces
have different procedures,

305
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,180
so I want you to listen carefully.

306
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,340
Sir, I'm just not entirely sure
of the logistics of this operation.

307
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,697
Well, if you just let
me finish Detective..

308
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:07,971
Fitzroy, Sir.

309
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:12,439
Uniform will enter..
Oliver Fitzroy, Sir.

310
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,929
As I was saying, we will go in
through the front

311
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,506
and to the best of our knowledge,

312
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,380
this gang hasn't used firearms before.

313
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,402
However, we should
be prepared for anything.

314
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:22,793
When you say anything, Sir...

315
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:25,024
Oi! pretty boy, shut your goblet.
Let the skipper speak.

316
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:29,118
What the 'ell's going
on with your hair?

317
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,007
Enough.

318
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,968
I want this to run like clockwork
so no one moves till I say.

319
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:38,607
We still have the element of
surprise, so let's keep it that way.

320
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,860
Get to it,

321
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,310
Detective Fitzroy.

322
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,350
Word, please...

323
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,366
You're new so..

324
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,579
Not that new actually Sir.
I was posted at Essex before...

325
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,643
..so I'm going to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

326
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:57,360
Interrupt me again and you'll
be cleaning out the latrines in the cells.

327
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,630
Is that clear?

328
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,224
Yes, Sir.

329
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:02,710
Sorry Sir, permission
to speak, Sir

330
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,175
Permission denied.

331
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,230
Get to it.

332
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,822
Miss Scarlet.

333
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,564
Miss Yates?

334
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,340
I can tell you some things
about Georgina but not here.

335
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,030
So you think Georgina's run away?

336
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,649
I don't think.

337
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,173
I know.

338
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:36,536
And it's the same reason
she ran away from her village.

339
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,440
Get away from that sister.

340
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,350
She was terrified of her.

341
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,490
But it was my understanding
that Georgina left Yorkshire

342
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,570
to find a job in London.

343
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,858
Well, her sister would
say that wouldn't she?

344
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,399
and Georgina had a different story.

345
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,223
Her sister was suffocating.

346
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,650
Treated like a baby.

347
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,310
She even sewed Georgina's name in all of her
clothes like she was some little schoolgirl

348
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,940
and if she stepped out of line...

349
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,220
Why run away from London

350
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,620
when her sister's in Yorkshire?

351
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,280
Because she told Georgina she
was moving down to be nearer.

352
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,464
She wanted to control
the poor little mare.

353
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,228
So where's she gone?

354
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,560
I told her to tell no one.

355
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:12,330
Not even me.

356
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:14,840
She needed a new
start away from that one

357
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,030
breathing down her neck.

358
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:19,073
I'm telling you

359
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,254
that Miss Lee is no lady.

360
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:25,526
Not like us.

361
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,950
Oi, you! Get your hands up.

362
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,443
Where you going?

363
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,053
Nowhere!

364
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:57,209
Do something useful detective.
Check upstairs.

365
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:58,750
Make sure this is the lot of them.

366
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:01,490
That's it.
Nice and easy does it.

367
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,280
Where is the stash?

368
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:08,044
Well, it's here somewhere.

369
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,315
I'll find it myself.

370
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,780
Cell waiting for you.

371
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,519
All clear upstairs, Sir.

372
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,120
You search down here.
I'll take upstairs.

373
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,383
Go on, go on..

374
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:29,098
Your revolver.
Use it!

375
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:52,670
Are you always this useless detective?

376
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,263
I don't know what to say Sir.

377
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,990
I told you to do a thorough check.

378
00:20:57,503 --> 00:21:00,058
I did, at least I believed I did.

379
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:02,675
Well, this gentleman is
evidence to the contrary.

380
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,610
I've looked into your case and spoken
with some of those who knew Georgina

381
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,100
at Wentworth, in particular
and Miss Jane Yates.

382
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,510
She has a different
version of events.

383
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,730
This was forwarded from
my home address in Yorkshire.

384
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,967
I received it this morning.

385
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,700
Dear Mother, I'm sorry
I have caused you worry.

386
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,780
Please know that all is well
and I will be in touch soon

387
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,890
With fondest love, Georgina.

388
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,091
But I thought you said your
mother and father were dead.

389
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:37,170
The telegram is a lie.

390
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,750
Georgina did not send it.

391
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:45,624
There's something I should tell you.

392
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:50,610
Something I have never told
a living soul apart from Georgina.

393
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
She's my daughter.

394
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,990
I was young and I had
her out of wedlock.

395
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,240
To save the disgrace on my family,

396
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,670
we were brought up as sisters.

397
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,820
Georgina never called me mother.

398
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:06,020
Only ever Alice.

399
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,450
So whoever sent this
knew your secret.

400
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:13,793
Must have been
someone close to her.

401
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,508
Someone she trusted to confide in.

402
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:41,873
Miss Yates

403
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:44,232
It's Miss Scarlett.

404
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,720
You sure you're all right?

405
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:24,170
Just a little shocked.

406
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,479
It's not every day one is shot at.

407
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,470
What are you doing here?

408
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:30,285
Working a case.

409
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,020
The Georgina Lee case.

410
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,681
Her sister came into Scotland Yard.

411
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:39,478
The lady that was upset.

412
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:42,353
You reopened one of my cases.

413
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:46,170
You must understand that you
sought out Miss Lee's business

414
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,050
after learning how dissatisfied
she was with my service.

415
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:50,137
Of course not.

416
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:51,641
I secured the case
through Moses.

417
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Moses, ah...

418
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:55,010
I didn't intend to become embroiled.

419
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
It just happened.

420
00:23:56,197 --> 00:23:58,840
Things have a tendency
to just happen to you, Eliza.

421
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,886
It's about time you took some credit
for your decisions.

422
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,940
If you had any respect
for me or my position,

423
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,343
then you would not have reopened it.

424
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:05,252
Well, it's a good job I did

425
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,027
because you most
certainly missed something.

426
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,580
Do you have any idea
how many cases I have to deal with?

427
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:12,608
I don't have the luxury
of working one case at a time as you do.

428
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:15,126
Well, more's the pity because the
investigation into Georgina Lee was poor

429
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,150
indeed, William.

430
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:18,018
So.

431
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,046
What is it?

432
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,910
He was in the street
at the time of the murder.

433
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,520
I thought he might know something

434
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,850
and you thought you would bring him here
to the crime scene for God's sake.

435
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,210
Calm yourself,

436
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,500
William take him in for questioning and
start using your common sense, detective.

437
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:36,968
William..

438
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:39,851
Never call me that
again in front of my men.

439
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:49,598
So.

440
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,130
Now you wish to speak to me.

441
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:56,270
I apologize if you feel that we
did not give your sister's case

442
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,810
the attention that it deserved.

443
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,570
That is an understatement.

444
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,950
We've hundreds if not thousands
of missing persons reports every year.

445
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,790
We endeavour to do our best.

446
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,680
We are doing everything to find Georgina

447
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,116
Only because Miss Scarlett
has shone a light on your incompetence.

448
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,890
Perhaps we might be
better concentrating on

449
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,370
how we proceed from here?

450
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,796
The lady who was murdered..

451
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,110
Jane Yates.

452
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,960
Tell me about Georgina's
relationship with her.

453
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,070
I know she worked with my sister.

454
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,890
I also know she's a liar.

455
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,200
She said Georgina was scared of me.

456
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,640
She told Miss Scarlet as much.

457
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,190
That's just please focus on something
other than Miss Scarlet

458
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,680
and her investigation.

459
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,040
At least she's done
an investigation.

460
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,400
What the hell is going on here?

461
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,090
Who does this
revolver belong to?

462
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,950
I can only apologise, Sir.

463
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,800
I was guiding him into the cell
to sober him up.

464
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,850
When he pulled the gun
from my holster and..

465
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,500
Beyond my comprehension,
how a man like you

466
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,090
has got to the rank of detective.

467
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,269
Do I have permission
to enlighten you, Sir?

468
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,678
It was rhetorical question.

469
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,790
Oh, forgive me.

470
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,010
I'm equally at a loss as to

471
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,357
why a man like yourself
would want to do this job.

472
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,556
I don't wish to be personal,

473
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,620
but you look more like
a poet than a police officer.

474
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,510
Please do not think you offend me
with your observation, Sir.

475
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,280
I take that as a compliment.

476
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,010
You see, Lord Byron
is a hero of mine

477
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,997
and I like to think that maybe one day

478
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,753
I'll have some poetry of
my own published.

479
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,853
Detective Fitzroy..

480
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,970
The simple fact is that you do
not belong here.

481
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,530
You are a danger to yourself
and to the rest of my men,

482
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,070
so I have no alternative
but to dismiss you.

483
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,550
With immediate effect.

484
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,190
I understand, Sir.

485
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,140
That means you need
to leave Detective.

486
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,570
Yes, of course, Sir.

487
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,999
For heaven's sake.

488
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:56,815
You don't like me
to wait in your office.

489
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,010
Now you don't like me
to wait outside.

490
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,370
I could have killed you Moses.

491
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,970
You couldn't open
an envelope with that thing.

492
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,900
What have you got for me?

493
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,257
So Miss Yates was making a lot more money

494
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:12,494
than a mere shopgirl.

495
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:13,714
Guarding their bank account.

496
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,871
That's how she was able to afford rent
on such an expensive apartment.

497
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,580
How did you find these things out?

498
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,650
I'm a man of many talents.

499
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,300
You're a man with a talent
for avoiding questions.

500
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,610
Miss Yates was making regular
payments to another account.

501
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,950
Know this man?

502
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,770
Welcome to Wentworths, Madam.

503
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860
The Pandora's box
of the West End.

504
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm quite sure a lady as elegant as yourself
knows exactly what she's looking for.

505
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,160
However, if you are in
need of any assistance,

506
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,780
please do not...
- Mr Salisbury..

507
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,020
Who on earth are you?

508
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,960
You didn't say that last night.

509
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,386
Clementine. Nice to meet you.

510
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:02,175
Would Madam excuse me for one moment?

511
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,680
I don't know who you are ..
- Got a message for you..

512
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
What message?

513
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,750
Where is she?

514
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,690
You think it is funny

515
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,070
sending that woman?

516
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,196
Well, you made it abundantly clear
that I wasn't welcome in the stores,

517
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,950
so I thought it wise to send an associate.

518
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,810
If she is an associate, tells me everything
about the type of outfit you're running.

519
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,583
I'm more interested in the outfit
that you're running, Mr Salisbury.

520
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:40,580
I know that Jane Yates
was depositing money

521
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,990
into your account each month.

522
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,866
The fact that you're here
with me now suggests

523
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,090
that this isn't something
you wish to share with anyone.

524
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:59,100
I arrange liaisons between the girls
and rich customers for a fee.

525
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,010
Sometimes it is more
than just shopping.

526
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
The girls oblige with...

527
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,480
That's how they
supplement their wages.

528
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,050
Could any of these customers

529
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,836
who wanted Jane Yates dead
- a married client, perhaps -

530
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,500
God only knows.
She had a lot of men.

531
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,030
One of the most popular girls.
She was a good earner.

532
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,420
And what if..

533
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
...Georgina...

534
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,758
Who were her regular customers?

535
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:32,063
Georgina?
She did not have any.

536
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,728
He would not share her
with anyone else.

537
00:30:34,828 --> 00:30:35,828
He?

538
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,170
He is powerful,

539
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,890
rich.

540
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,520
Perhaps I've said too much.

541
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,664
Let me be clear, Mr. Salisbury.

542
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:45,450
If you don't tell me,

543
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,028
I will share what information I have

544
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,940
with Inspector Wellington
and Scotland Yard.

545
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,520
You will lose your job,
your reputation,

546
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,910
and if anyone's unfortunate
enough to be

547
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,140
Mrs Salisbury, your wife...

548
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,856
It was Mr. Wentworth.

549
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,590
Tell me Wentworth's daily movements.

550
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,626
Every day at noon he goes
to Levine's tea house.

551
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,941
He likes the waitresses in there.

552
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,313
These are Georgina Lee's clothes.

553
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:24,999
How do you know?

554
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,630
They have her name
sewn into them.

555
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,960
If someone had
murdered Georgina Lee...

556
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,408
Let's not jump to conclusions.

557
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:38,331
...the most obvious motive would be
to silence her over their affair.

558
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,780
Maybe she threatened to
kill his pregnant wife.

559
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,380
Maybe Jane Yates found out.

560
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,297
The extra money she was
earning might not

561
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,157
have just been from
her services on the side.

562
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,060
Maybe she was blackmailing the wife

563
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,670
and he got rid of her, too.

564
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,605
And this is you not jumping
to conclusions, is it?

565
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,535
Well one of us has to, William.

566
00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:57,161
because the other seems stuck
in some kind of sulk.

567
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,330
I'm a grown man.
I don't sulk.

568
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,620
I said I was sorry
for reopening the case.

569
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,012
Don't do that.

570
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:03,644
What?

571
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:06,024
You'd rewrite history and then you
convince me that it's so.

572
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,370
All right, fine.

573
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,077
I didn't apologise.

574
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,116
I do now.

575
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,810
I'm sorry, William.

576
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,050
I should have spoken to you first.

577
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:26,052
And if you had and I had
asked you not to take it,

578
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:27,443
would it have made
any difference?

579
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,484
Here you go, Sir.

580
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,279
Thank you.

581
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,232
The telegram to Miss Lee was sent
from the county of Buckinghamshire,

582
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,975
Beaconsfield. Wentworth
has a country residence there.

583
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,354
Wentworth's wife's gone into labour.
Said it's his house in the country.

584
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,290
Yeah?

585
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,498
Is Mr. Wentworth home?

586
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:08,260
Inspector Wellington, Scotland Yard.

587
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,052
I'd like to speak with him

588
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,290
now please.

589
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,090
No one's allowed upstairs.

590
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,329
Georgina.

591
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,130
I had given up hope
of ever becoming a mother.

592
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,270
Until one night I happened
across Georgina.

593
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,662
The store was closed
and I found her crying.

594
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,650
She revealed to me her
affair with my husband.

595
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,730
And the pregnancy, she told me
of the secret of her family,

596
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,380
how her mother had been
raised as her sister.

597
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,350
She did not want to bring
any more disgrace upon them.

598
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,212
So you agreed to raise
the baby to your own.

599
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,040
And pass yourself off
as expecting.

600
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,630
Georgina was very sick
during the pregnancy.

601
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,820
She feared she might not
survive the birth.

602
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,290
She wrote to her friend, Miss Yates,
to let her know where she was.

603
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,940
And if she were to die.

604
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,030
She wanted her mother
to know what she had done.

605
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,410
But Miss Yates used this
information to blackmail us.

606
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,970
Humiliation of everyone knowing
that my wife's pregnancy was false.

607
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,090
I'd be a laughing stock.

608
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,160
My reputation would be destroyed.

609
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,200
Perhaps you should have thought of that
before getting a young woman pregnant.

610
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,860
I assume Miss Yates' demands
became untenable.

611
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,090
So you dealt with her.

612
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,725
It was me.

613
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,743
I went to speak to Miss Yates

614
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:09,684
and I took the revolver
just to scare her.

615
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:15,611
But when I arrived, she said
that I was an unnatural woman

616
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,700
and that I was defective for being

617
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,985
unable to carry my own child.

618
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:22,783
she jeered at me
and the next thing I know,

619
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,031
I pulled the trigger.

620
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
Right...

621
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,107
We have

622
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,036
much to discuss.

623
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,931
Hmm.

624
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:13,645
We still have our dinner
reservation this evening.

625
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,890
Perhaps then.

626
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:17,927
Sir.

627
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,101
Superintendent wants to see me.

628
00:37:26,364 --> 00:37:27,480
I'll see you later.

629
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,645
Inspector Wellington.

630
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:32,595
Miss Scarlet.

631
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,057
You requested to see me, Sir.

632
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:45,192
Come in, Inspector Wellington.

633
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,761
There seems to be a misunderstanding
with Detective Fitzroy.

634
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,749
There's no misunderstanding, Sir.

635
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,356
The man is not equipped
to be a constable.

636
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,449
Never mind detective.
- Leave us.

637
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:58,834
Yes, Sir.

638
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,960
Detective Fitzroy is the son
of the police commissioner

639
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,620
and on his father's instructions

640
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,430
Fitzroy has been elevated
through the ranks.

641
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,786
Even though he has not had
the sufficient experience

642
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,100
needed to warrant these promotions.

643
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,848
Well, surely this cannot be
allowed to continue, Sir.

644
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:24,700
I'll show you this mail, laddie.

645
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,700
I myself have been stuck with him

646
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,160
for the last six months,

647
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,080
but when you come from a powerful
family, such as the Commissioner's.

648
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,270
All justice goes out the
window, I'm afraid.

649
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,670
Are you saying that I can't dismiss
one of my own men, Sir?

650
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,351
I am saying you're more than capable
of dealing with him, inspector.

651
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,620
It's just a little arrangement.

652
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,309
These things have to
be done from time to time

653
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,429
to keep things well oiled

654
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,139
and running smoothly. Understood?

655
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,845
Understood, Sir

656
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:57,983
Good.

657
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:01,777
Now.

658
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,327
No more traipsing through
allotments, please.

659
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,718
Can't afford to keep making
you new dresses.

660
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,635
Lizzie are you listening to me?

661
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,259
No.

662
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,730
You look beautiful.

663
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,479
I only wish you were
here to see you.

664
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,332
Don't do that.

665
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,174
You know I don't like it
when you get upset.

666
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,920
I just hate to see you alone.

667
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,010
That's all.

668
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,050
I'm not alone.

669
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,270
I have you.

670
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,490
That can't be Willie.

671
00:39:33,528 --> 00:39:34,528
He's not due for hours.

672
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,430
Is it Wednesday already?

673
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,623
I probably shouldn't.

674
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,990
My aunt says 'Harriet'

675
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,098
'No wonder no one wishes
to marry you.'

676
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,308
'You have the appetite of a man'

677
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,422
'which is most unseemly.'

678
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:57,317
She's so funny.

679
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,653
My aunt means well and requesting me
to come to London and be her companion

680
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:02,753
was an offer of kindness.

681
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,403
It's an offer that benefits her too.

682
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,430
I do not blame you
for your low opinion

683
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,560
of my aunt, Miss Scarlet.

684
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,637
My cousin has told me of your history,

685
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,020
which is why I have come up
with the most marvelous idea.

686
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,600
My aunt is on the Committee
for the Ladies Cultural Society

687
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,540
and they are always looking
for new speakers and I thought

688
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,810
how about Miss Scarlet
and her detective adventures?

689
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,960
Why on earth would I want to do that?

690
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,090
I had hoped we would become friends.

691
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,130
I do not have
many friends in London.

692
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:34,490
Well.

693
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Any at all really.

694
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,930
So it would be easier
if my aunt approved of you.

695
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,690
Miss Parker...
- Hattie

696
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,650
Hattie.

697
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,100
I have no need nor deSire
for your aunt's approval.

698
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,597
You are so lucky.

699
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,340
You have such freedom.

700
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,717
How did you come to that conclusion?

701
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,740
First, you are a woman
and according to my cousin,

702
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,520
more often than not
struggling with finance

703
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,337
and your business,
not to mention

704
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:05,917
not being taken seriously, of course.

705
00:41:05,945 --> 00:41:07,707
You're merely proving
my point, I think.

706
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,670
But...
you know who you are.

707
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,030
and what you want.

708
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,340
Many may not approve, but

709
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,410
you simply do not care.

710
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,340
I call that freedom indeed.

711
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:31,169
It's Inspector Wellington.

712
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
William.

713
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,875
Eliza.

714
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,126
Before we go out to dine,
I need to tell you something.

715
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,201
Please, sit down.

716
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,031
William, in answer to your question,

717
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,562
Would I have taken the case

718
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:04,784
had you asked me not to?

719
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
The simple truth is..

720
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,734
Denying me would have
made me want it all the more.

721
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:11,520
My freedom to make
my own decisions

722
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,320
and to choose the work
I wish to take is everything to me.

723
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:15,111
Eliza..

724
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:16,481
Please let me finish.

725
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,094
You mean a great deal,

726
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,814
but I would not be dictated to.

727
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,500
I will have no master.

728
00:42:24,652 --> 00:42:27,024
So if we are to have
some kind of future.

729
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:28,922
I thought it important
to be clear

730
00:42:29,022 --> 00:42:30,542
where I stand before
we go out to dine.

731
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,972
Eliza, I've cancelled
our dinner reservation.

732
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,893
Oh

733
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,865
It's pointless was to deny the truth that
if we were anything more than friends,

734
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:44,793
my position would be untenable.

735
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,300
The fact is I am undermined
already with the added humiliation.

736
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,670
It's, er..

737
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,744
It's better for both of us

738
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,770
to

739
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,893
to leave things
as they are for now.

740
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,958
Goodnight, Eliza.

741
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,649
Goodnight, William.
