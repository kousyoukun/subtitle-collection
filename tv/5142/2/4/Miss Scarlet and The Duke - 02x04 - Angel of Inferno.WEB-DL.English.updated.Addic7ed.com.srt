1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,040
Well.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,920
I'm simply making the point that I didn't
care that well aware of that.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,720
But perhaps you misjudged him.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,160
To you,
he is every bit the principal described.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,240
We're all entitled to our opinions.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,040
You insist on this challenge, Mr..

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,560
The least you can do is convince
a tsunami access the military.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,600
Firstly, we are merely friends.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,880
Secondly,
if we're more than that which we are not.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,760
I couldn't possibly ask Barnabas
to change his rules.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
Some of us have shopping to do,
but the market is that way.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,160
I'm going to head office
and Hanwell Street trying new hat.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,320
Let me guess.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,360
Does this have anything to do
with a certain Barnabas?

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,320
I don't have time for this.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,240
You seeing him today?

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:01:18,120
Goodbye, Lizzie.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,120
Yes. What is it?

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,120
I have

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,160
that information on the lady
detective, sir.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:02:13,880
No, the Scarlet.

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
Mr. Doyle, assistant to Dr. Flint.

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,720
My employer had hoped
that you might grant us to meet her.

24
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
Dr. Flint would like to.

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Hi on a rather sensitive issue.

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,720
But I up to the job, young lady.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,320
I can assure you
I've had many satisfied clients.

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
By the looks of you.

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,880
Well, when would see you fall over?

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,920
We received this anonymous letter.

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,640
It advised that a bottle of our elixir
had been poisoned

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,400
and placed on the shelf
of one of our market stalls.

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,720
We had it tested, and indeed it does

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,240
contain a toxin derived from a plant

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,920
known as the Angel of Infernal.

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,880
£1,000 to be left to St Pancras Station.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,720
If it is not forthcoming, the money
demanded would increase in a second.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,600
Poisoning will occur.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,640
This is day two, several days ago.

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,560
The deadline has passed.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,360
Why didn't you engage me sooner?

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
We wish to keep it from public knowledge.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,520
As such, you will have to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh. Well, I'll have to read it
thoroughly first.

45
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,840
Do you want this case or not, young lady?

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
My name is Miss Scarlet.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,240
If I'm to be your client, I shall call it
whatever I damn well please.

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,640
I'm extremely busy
with other cases at the moment.

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,800
So in regards to you, please,
I will, of course, find time to take it.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,920
Where do I sign?

52
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,400
You just sit there.

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,880
I am the very.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,320
Modern.

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,120
Collection.

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
Vegetable, vegetable and mineral.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,880
I knew the kings of England unequipped
to fight.

58
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,840
Just protocol from marathon to Waterloo
in order to stop the article.

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,040
I'm very good at integrals,
differential calculus.

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,200
I know the scientific names of beings,
animal killers in.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,640
Short matters vegetable.
Animal and mineral.

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,960
I am the very model of a modern meat. You.

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,720
Hello, Father.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
I thought it impossible

65
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,840
that you could disappoint me any further,
but clearly I was wrong.

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm glad.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,720
Your mother isn't alive to. See this.

68
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,520
You're officially a police detective.

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,160
Oh, a flying fox,

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,480
for example.

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,920
Where's Inspector Wellington?

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,480
Can I help you, sir?

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,840
You were meant to teach my son
to be a detective.

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,400
Yet now I find him filing here
like some junior clerk.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
I can explain, sir.

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,320
Your son is an extremely proficient
police officer.

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,120
However, he has been in the force
for barely half a year,

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
and entering it detective level
means he still has a great deal to learn.

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,720
My son requests this position.

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
No, sir.

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,680
I took the decision
to put my own administration justice,

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,240
since I felt it imperative that he acquire
the knowledge from the ground up.

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,200
Listen carefully, Inspector Warrington,

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,360
because I'm going to tell you
exactly what he's going to happen here.

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
Fitzroy will be

86
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,480
reinstated as a police detective
with immediate effect.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,840
The feeble, insubstantial character

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,360
that has blighted him
since birth will be knocked out of him

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,920
and he will be turned into a man
that his family can finally be proud of.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,560
Police Commissioners Words are not mine.

91
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,560
He's insisting that Fitzroy make inspector
by the end of the year.

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,520
Police Commissioner.

93
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Who gets the Police Commissioner at once?

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
Become serious, sir.

95
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,040
My job is to ensure the effective
running of this constabulary.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Of my kindness.

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,920
Financial planning.

98
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,000
The last few months

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,320
I've been petitioning the Commissioner
to push the Home Office to review budgets.

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,480
This city has grown with eight extra

101
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,240
miles of new residential streets
to patrol and Tottenham alone.

102
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,080
Surely the fate of a son
is entirely separate matter.

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,040
So you have a lot to learn
if you think that is the case.

104
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
Fitzroy is a sort of a

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
decent young man, but he's no detective,
let alone suspect material.

106
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,560
The streets are getting
more violent year on year

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,080
and if he is placed back in action,

108
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,680
he will not only put his own life at risk,
but my men to

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,240
take us here.

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,240
You and I have been odds recently.

111
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,000
However,

112
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,640
in this instance, there is nothing
you have said that I do not concur with.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
But be that as it may, I'm afraid

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,120
we have no choice in the matter.

115
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,000
Which is why I've made a decision.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
So Fitzroy will be.

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,680
Taken from your command
and placed under Detective Phelps.

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
Phelps? He's the last.

119
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,680
But in that case, please give up or die
trying.

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,200
And I am sure his family
will receive a medal with him.

121
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,240
Sure will go down well with his father.

122
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,920
Listen to me, lady.

123
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,200
You. You've got a good future
ahead of you.

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,760
Fitzroy
will only block in your reputation.

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,480
Is that what you want?

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,160
Of course not so good.

127
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,240
And he will transfer to Detective Phelps
with immediate effect.

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,720
And that is an order?

129
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
Yes. Sir.

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,600
Good afternoon, Mr.

131
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,000
Scott.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,640
I was in need of your advice.

133
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,280
I question the poisonous properties
of a particular plant.

134
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,360
Mr. Cole, my break is over,
and I must return to my duties.

135
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,880
I cannot wait to hear on the street
discussing botany with you.

136
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,920
I quite understand.

137
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,040
So perhaps I should come inside.

138
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
British Library.

139
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,200
To me, a ten minute stroll
from this very spot.

140
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm sure you'll find the answer

141
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,040
to all manner of questions
within its hallowed walls.

142
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,440
If you'll excuse me.

143
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,720
I was asking after you this morning.

144
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
Yes. I have, of course,
gave a very agreeable account of you.

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,440
How can you continue to do so?

146
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,760
What are you saying exactly?

147
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,520
You scratch my back
and I'll scratch yours.

148
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,080
Now, you two should not say
such unseemly things.

149
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
It is not. Christian.

150
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,640
If you help me,
I will continue to sing your praises.

151
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
But that is blackmail.

152
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,840
That is business.

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,840
So do we have a deal?

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,920
He's a man.

155
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:48,720
He seems to be watching you.

156
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,080
We got Mr.

157
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,640
Barnes

158
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,240
ciphers siphons.

159
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:07,880
Come to God.

160
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,760
It's your father's handiwork.

161
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,360
I see. Of, sir.

162
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,200
I'd like to convey how much I'm looking
forward to coming back to the field.

163
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,160
But I think there's been some mistake.

164
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,960
I've been told to report
to Detective Phelps.

165
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,280
No mistake.

166
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
But Detective Phelps loathes me.

167
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,520
He thinks I'm just some spoiled toff
born with a silver spoon in my mouth.

168
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,080
Detective Phelps is a very good officer.

169
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
He's a thug.

170
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Detective Phelps, as your superior,
and you will show respect.

171
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,320
As I understood. Yes, sir.

172
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,240
Not if there's nothing else.

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,320
I just.

174
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,880
I don't understand
why I can't stand your command.

175
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,120
You somehow suggesting
that I'll give you an easier time?

176
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,720
Of course not.

177
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
So good.

178
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
I'll get back to work.

179
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:47,840
Yes, sir.

180
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,680
Why are you following me?

181
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,040
I long to meet the lady detective.

182
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,600
It's Patrick Marsh. Right.

183
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,880
Then I'll ask you instead

184
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,320
by following me.

185
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Now, when I first heard about you,
Scarlett, I assumed

186
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,040
being a detective was a mere hobby.

187
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,320
You might find the odd rich lady's
missing poodle that you'd soon tired.

188
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,160
In fact, my men were so amused by the idea
of a female detective,

189
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,040
they took bets on how long you'd last.

190
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,000
But weeks went by.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,840
And months you still in the game
and somehow you became less amusing.

192
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,040
What do you want?

193
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,120
You are determined, ambitious,

194
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,160
hungry.

195
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,720
The Holy Trinity.

196
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,640
In short, I want you to come work for me.

197
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,520
She was talking into my office,
took turns.

198
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,840
I've heard of your agency, Mr.

199
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,200
Nash, and the means
by which you and your men investigate.

200
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,240
I hear blackmail is your favorite tool.

201
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,600
Sure.

202
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
You know better than to listen to rumors.

203
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,400
Thank you for your offer, but no,
thank you.

204
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:05,480
The police call off your dogs.

205
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
It is a shame.

206
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,120
Since we are kindred spirits.

207
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
As an Irishman,
I know what it is to face prejudice.

208
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
I can assure you
we have nothing in common.

209
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,160
That's not strictly true.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
In the defense case, for one,

211
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,920
there is a reason why you were brought
onto this case so late in the day.

212
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,560
Dr. Flint came to see me first,
but I was too expensive.

213
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,800
Of course. So we went to see Dillon's son.

214
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,600
But they were also too
costly for the old miner.

215
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,440
So we went around the city,
but to no avail, until he found someone

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
with the lowest fees in London.

217
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,280
You. You're selling yourself short.

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,400
Would I charges no business of yours?

219
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,280
It is when I have to undercut you.

220
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,360
I'll be sending one to amend.

221
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,400
Little to think. Now I've changed my mind.

222
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,720
You can have my services for free now.

223
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,400
Unless, of course.

224
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,160
You wish to reconsider my offer.

225
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
On that case.

226
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
May the best man win.

227
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,560
I look forward to it, Miss Scarlett.

228
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,240
I do love a challenge.

229
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,960
The Royal Botanical Society is
always happy to welcome the new members.

230
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,840
Ms.. Belfry.

231
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,440
That is music to my ears, Mr. Humphreys.

232
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,040
I'm only an amateur enthusiast,
but I do love to be close to nature.

233
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,400
Yeah. Oh, hi.

234
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,760
What a lovely shrub.

235
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,840
Oh, that's his new shrub, Miss Belfry.

236
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
That is a

237
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,600
Osmond.

238
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,240
Regardless, to be precise.

239
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
How I do have to be corrected, Mr.

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,760
Humphreys.

241
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,440
In fact,

242
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,280
perhaps you might give me
your expert advice on another plant,

243
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,040
the Angel of Inferno and its poisonous

244
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,000
properties and exotic location
have quite captured my imagination.

245
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
As you have captured mine, my dear.

246
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,280
And please correct me if I'm wrong,
but did I read that it not only grows

247
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,120
on the volcanic slopes of Guatemala,
but also here in society?

248
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,520
Indeed, we do have the plant.

249
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,320
However, due to its toxic capabilities,
it is kept in a section for members only.

250
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,160
And at present

251
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,320
you are not a member.

252
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,840
I could add your name to our waiting list.

253
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,640
Oh, a very long waiting list.

254
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,200
Or perhaps as curator,

255
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,840
I may be able to move your name
to the top.

256
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,360
This kind, Mr. Humphreys.

257
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,920
But might

258
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,600
I have a little put your membership
list first.

259
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,840
As an unmarried lady, it's imperative
I associate with only the right.

260
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Sort of course.

261
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,920
I have the list in my office.

262
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,400
However,
I am overdue for my next appointment.

263
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,880
So perhaps you could

264
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,640
come back tomorrow.

265
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,600
Oh, I do love roses.

266
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,440
Oh, my goodness.

267
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,920
You seem to be my.

268
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,840
I dear Miss Belfry.

269
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Ill fitting famous Humphreys.

270
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,240
Might I attend to my injury
in the privacy of your office?

271
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,080
My appointment can wait

272
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:51,720
alone.

273
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,920
So I do not need your help, Mr.

274
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,680
Humphreys.

275
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
Nor would I be free to give it to you
at this precise moment.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Spell for you.

277
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,240
See, the police are here and require
my assistance on an urgent matter.

278
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,960
Membership list, Mr.
Humphreys. Of course. Inspector Bates

279
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,640
spoke to Bates.

280
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,480
He say

281
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
I want acquainted with the officers
at Scotland Yard,

282
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,280
but have not had mentioned to you before.

283
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,360
You are well acquainted with Scotland
Yard.

284
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,720
Well, Crusty madam,
you don't look like a lawbreaker to me.

285
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,360
How exactly are you acquainted,
Miss Palfrey?

286
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,720
My uncle works for the Home Office.

287
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
Oh, many friends in that department.

288
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,960
Well, shouldn't it, Mr.

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,840
Fenchurch?

290
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,280
Oh, yes, Mr. Fenchurch.

291
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,240
On a number of occasions, just to shine,
a woman's reputation can be lost forever.

292
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,120
But why?

293
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,000
So many of his colleagues have frequented
that particular East End brothel?

294
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,840
It's just unfortunate
that he was caught. Hmm.

295
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,800
I don't wish to be rude, Mr.

296
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,280
Humphreys,
but this is a confidential matter.

297
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,360
Absolutely, Inspector.

298
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,080
If you don't mind, Mr.

299
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:08,240
Palfrey.

300
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,360
Well, even a better idea than I have.

301
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,320
Doubtless, because he was.

302
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,720
I didn't see him.

303
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,520
Action, son.

304
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,200
The man has a.

305
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,160
Sons, a liar and a crook.

306
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,840
As a means of investigation.

307
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,640
In order to.

308
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,240
For the Metropolitan Police
use them against results.

309
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,160
More questions asked.

310
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
Well, he's undercutting me with a client.

311
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,560
Client
who sees himself as a very unpleasant man.

312
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,720
So if you have some pleasant company,
then you come to the wrong place

313
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,920
at a horrible day.

314
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,160
Every man I've had to do with
has been detestable.

315
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
I've got to drop by.

316
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm glad you did, too.

317
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,640
The fact is this Nash has ten times
my resources, and I need your help.

318
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,720
Unless my world doesn't revolve around
you, I have my own problems.

319
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm trying to hunt down a blackmailer.

320
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
If I don't,
another bottle of this will be poisoned.

321
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,920
Well, worst natural in the case.

322
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,280
Nash.

323
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,640
Winning the case is worse
than a member of the public dying.

324
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,960
Don't use my words.

325
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,000
I didn't realize this is serious.

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
And then please be informed.

327
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,680
No, it's highly confidential.

328
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,480
Not when there's a threat to life.
It isn't.

329
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,200
But I signed a confidentiality agreement.

330
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,320
You think that I want or need more cases.

331
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,560
But as an officer of the law,
when there is a danger

332
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,920
to the general public,
then the police must investigate.

333
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
Fine.

334
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,120
I need time to write up my notes.

335
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,920
I'll bring you what I have
by the end of the day.

336
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,400
I don't know.

337
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
Look what the look that is covering
a multitude of calculations

338
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,160
that are currently racing through your.

339
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,360
Had no idea what you're
talking about, William.

340
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,480
Of course you don't.

341
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:56,240
End of the day, Eliza.

342
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,160
You should have a proper dinner at home
this evening.

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Eating supper at your desk is not right.

344
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,240
I don't know what your father would say.

345
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
Actually,
I do know what your fathers say. Dan.

346
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,240
Father Ivy.

347
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,040
She doesn't listen anyway.

348
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,920
What exactly are you looking for?

349
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,560
Whoever this poisoner is,
they had access to the botanical society.

350
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,280
It's the only place

351
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,440
other than Guatemala
that grows this angel of Inferno.

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,880
I've tried to establish

353
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,920
who the members are,
but as yet have only found a few of those.

354
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,120
I can find
absolutely no connection to Dr. Flint.

355
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
Shouldn't
you be on your way to Scotland Yard by now

356
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,360
for a chance
to show your findings with respect to.

357
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,880
Well, I will.

358
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,120
But I have until the end of the day,

359
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,560
determined to find some leads first.

360
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,760
Scotland Yard cracked this case.

361
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,600
I wanted to get some credit. Moreover,
I just didn't want Nash to win.

362
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,560
Well, can't you get my sister to help you?

363
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,120
Well, I would if I knew where he was.

364
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,960
Why does he disappeared then?

365
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,320
Not to ask.

366
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,840
I saw Mr.

367
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,160
Potts earlier.

368
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,800
He said he liked to.

369
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,840
And you had to do so.

370
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,640
You didn't see him today?

371
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,320
I left this stuff.

372
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,200
Used to for use, really?

373
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
As a cure for everything.

374
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,800
Coughs and clothes, a better kitted out,
stubborn stains than any soap can,

375
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,720
I can assure you, Dr. Flint is no doctor.

376
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,960
Nor is this
elixir anything other than flavored water.

377
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,040
Silicone.

378
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,000
Excuse me,
but I remember a certain young lady

379
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,360
used to love it as a girl,
but that they needed a different name.

380
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,920
Flint and Doyle's magic medicine.

381
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
In fact, sometimes I think

382
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,160
you pretended to have a sore throat
just so I could give you a spoonful.

383
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,520
Did you just say Flint and Doyle.

384
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,160
For one reason, to breathe out

385
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,640
to, like, the sound of that water?

386
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,960
There is a crackle.

387
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
On your chest, Cedric.

388
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,800
What have I told you about going out
without a blanket?

389
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,640
I told him many times, Doctor Stan.

390
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,520
Hoped that he should get a new carriage
with him to stoke faster

391
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,200
than the nearest child, the sculptor.

392
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,200
Please forgive the unexpected visit,

393
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
but I was hoping to have a private word
with Mr.

394
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,600
Doyle.

395
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,240
You have two surgeries to do.

396
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,320
I can say to me.

397
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,880
Your unwillingness to share your findings

398
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
suggest you have made no move.

399
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,240
No matter since.

400
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,800
Now I have an additional agency
looking for me.

401
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,600
Yes, I'm aware of that national sense.

402
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
Not that he has any sense.

403
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,800
They are confident that they will have
the blackmailer in custody

404
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,840
by this time tomorrow. Come along
now, please.

405
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,480
Cedric, come to.

406
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,520
My practice
so I can drop you at home on the way.

407
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,120
You wish to speak to me?

408
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,240
Please?

409
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,720
I'm the remedy you manufacture.

410
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,640
At one time,
it had a slightly different name.

411
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,760
Flint and Doyle's magic medicine.

412
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,400
My father met Dr.

413
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,840
Flint when he went to India looking
for ingredients for a health remedy.

414
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,040
They became partners
and my father moved over here.

415
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,440
Nobody would have bought a product
called Flint and Mahajan.

416
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,280
So my father changed his name to Doyle.

417
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,560
I know all too well that dilemma.

418
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,320
It's still my

419
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,240
father's name that hangs outside
my office.

420
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,760
They built the business together.

421
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,280
And then when my father died. Dr.

422
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,240
Flint took his name off the product.

423
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Surely such an action

424
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,920
would cause some resentment.

425
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,920
The Flint has been a good employer to me.

426
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,320
And if I am under suspicion.

427
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
Then you're mistaken.

428
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
I have to consider all possibilities, Mr.

429
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,320
Doyle.

430
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,040
If you will excuse me, I have work to. Do.

431
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:28,400
As you wish.

432
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,440
I do apologize.

433
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,480
My past.

434
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,680
You still know my past faith.

435
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,880
What are you talking about?
She's taken my purse.

436
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,680
I've done no such thing.

437
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,880
I saw.
But take it and put it in her pocket.

438
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,440
That particulars?

439
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah. She has it, you see.

440
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,120
Come with me, madam.

441
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:08,200
It was me who took it.

442
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,040
Inspector Wellington.

443
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,600
And nice to see you.

444
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,840
Riding in for a laser.

445
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,000
She's not our office.

446
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,160
Oh, well,
she's not here either, I'm afraid.

447
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,280
Would you like to leave a message?

448
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,720
She was meant to

449
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,080
deliver some information to me,
but it seems to have slipped from mine.

450
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,560
Two men. Have I come in? Wait.
I was just about to have dinner.

451
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:33,560
Oh. Oh, not the most welcome, gingerbread.

452
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,880
An intention of bringing me that file?

453
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,720
None whatsoever.

454
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,760
She's not up for anything
other than her own gain.

455
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,920
Well,
that's a little bit Inspector Wellington.

456
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,520
Yes. As a force.

457
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,560
But she's just trying
to make her way in. Life

458
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,280
will be missed, boss.

459
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,040
I think you Miss Watson.

460
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,120
Inspector.

461
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,120
I think you should agree with me.

462
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,440
Don't use the past.

463
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,120
Of course. Remaining a headache.

464
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,600
You seem impossible.

465
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,440
You can be

466
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
sure those weren't my exact words.

467
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,640
No, your exact words were impossible,
untrustworthy, uncrossed.

468
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,360
Miss Scott, it can be somewhat
single minded, but I think what Ms..

469
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,320
Would is scientists also have some truth

470
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,440
is, scarlet is a woman trying
to build a business in a world

471
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,440
usually the preserve of a man.

472
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
Come on in.

473
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,720
You know the.

474
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,960
Deficit is low.

475
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,320
If anything, I admire her fortitude.

476
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,520
Now you've changed your tune.

477
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,760
I remember you saying.
What this really is.

478
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Did you know the painter for.

479
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
But don't think so.

480
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,920
I'm pretty moist.

481
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,440
It's a pleasure to cook food. It

482
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,760
should have a

483
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,040
damn good explanation
when I catch up with.

484
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,120
Food to go.

485
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,920
I had no idea you were down here
all night.

486
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,960
I'll be sure to mention that Inspector
Wellington, when I thank him

487
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,800
for bailing me.

488
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,920
Frozen in the bail jar.

489
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,240
Because someone's got Mr. So stupid.

490
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,840
My dear Mr.

491
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,560
Carlos, what a pleasure it is to be once
again in your convivial company.

492
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,120
Likewise, Mr. Sinclair.

493
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,680
You are the reason for my bail.

494
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,880
Indeed I am.

495
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,840
And I'm quite certain
that a woman with such an inquiring mind

496
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,000
must have many questions
as to why Basil Sinclair

497
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,640
would do such a thing.

498
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,120
Allow me to explain, my dear.

499
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,120
The simple fact is that whenever
you have a featured

500
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,880
in my publication,
it has sold exponentially.

501
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,880
And as chief correspondent
of the Illustrated Police News,

502
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,760
it would be remiss of me not to pursue
the further adventures of the

503
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,440
Lady Detective.
You want to write a story about me?

504
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,040
My dear Miss Scarlet, if you wish to call
your latest investigation of Mr.

505
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,880
Ray, that is your prerogative.

506
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,040
I myself would rather an intoxicating

507
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,560
blend of blackmail, poison and witchcraft.

508
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,600
My investigation is highly confidential,

509
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,640
but I can confirm
there's no witchcraft involved.

510
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,520
As a steward of the people,
it would be cruel of me.

511
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,000
Deprive them of my tales
of this great city of ours.

512
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Do I make myself quite clear? No.

513
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,800
I will write this article
with or without your cooperation.

514
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,080
And either you will be my heroine or Mr.

515
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,800
Nash will be my hero.

516
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,360
The choice, as they say,

517
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,960
is yours.

518
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,680
This is blackmail.

519
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,120
This is business.

520
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,200
Oh, yes.

521
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,080
I recall Mr.

522
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,840
Watkins outside.

523
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,960
I'll be out in a minute. Mr. Price.

524
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,280
All I want you to take much.

525
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,480
Longer, and I'll give myself that night.

526
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,520
I want a scalp. That is right.

527
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,240
Generate on the Cooper mole.

528
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,200
That's the plan.
If there's more, I'm with Aria.

529
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,280
So to Fitzroy's to come with me.

530
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
A case has just come up
and I think there's help

531
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,320
for the governor, said the new governor.

532
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm telling you that Fitzroy is with me.

533
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,800
That's true.

534
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,280
Thank you, sir.

535
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,320
That's not what you're talking about.

536
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,520
Come along.

537
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,680
I assume this visit is confirmation

538
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,680
of your desire
to become a member of this belfry.

539
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,240
Although I am rather
concerned regarding this

540
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
wayward uncle of yours in the Home Office.

541
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,280
Since the scandal,
my family have cut ties.

542
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,080
Well, in that case, I would be honored
to brief you on every detail.

543
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,240
However, you might remember my mention
of a rather long waiting list, sir.

544
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,200
Perhaps dinner to discuss
moving your name to the top.

545
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
Oh, that would have been delightful.

546
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
However, I find myself
somewhat under the weather.

547
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,920
My over enthusiasm with the roses.

548
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,000
Yesterday,
my little break has become infected.

549
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,560
My dear Miss Belfry, it's nothing.

550
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,240
Just some foul smelling pus.

551
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,640
Extremely frustrating,
as it also prevented me

552
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,320
from attending your lecture last night.
Well.

553
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,520
It's more of a book launch.

554
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,840
The Village Trust was selling
their new publication to raise funds.

555
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,680
That's a very good cause.

556
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,320
Medicine for the poor.

557
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,160
That book has a chapter
on your Angel of Inferno.

558
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,400
Apparently, the toxin derived from
the leaves has a luminous quality.

559
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,480
A cloud that glows in the dark.

560
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,400
Extraordinary.

561
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,360
May I buy a copy of the book?

562
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,400
Oh, that nice police inspector
who you met in my office.

563
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,800
He attended the launch.

564
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,120
He bought the last copy.

565
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,840
Did he find what he was looking for
in your membership list?

566
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,640
I have no idea.

567
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,760
The confidential case, apparently.

568
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,400
But he did say
he was close to making an arrest.

569
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,560
This book, what is it called?

570
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,880
Here is a copy of the advertisement
from last night's launch.

571
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,920
You'll find the book in any good bookshop.

572
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,120
Kilo cure
the poisonous properties of plants.

573
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,560
Now to the other matter.

574
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,520
Dinner.

575
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,440
Let me just find my diary.

576
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,320
Shall we say

577
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,400
Monday?

578
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,640
Which should give your infection
time to heal?

579
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,960
Here we are. So,

580
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Miss Belfry.

581
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Before you start huffing and puffing.

582
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,240
Firstly, I need a cough. No cough.

583
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,080
Secondly, I have no inclination to be like
two again.

584
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,080
I want that case file.

585
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,760
I would have given it to you last night

586
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,520
had I not been arrested on some trumped up
charge made by Nash.

587
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,120
I spent the night in a cell. And yes,

588
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,800
I have been released 4 hours.

589
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,160
And I could have brought it to you.
But I'm professional, William.

590
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,840
And I wanted one last crack
at finding lead.

591
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,280
That I am.

592
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,520
What's he doing as a cheat in a good job?

593
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,120
Well, you never actually said to me.

594
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,480
I've said that to you many times.

595
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,680
Not nearly
enough. Here, have the damn case.

596
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,720
I'm at a dead end anyway,
which I'm sure will an easy.

597
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,560
This issue on in professionalism.

598
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,320
I apologize.

599
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,040
I have had a very trying few days,
but I meant what I said.

600
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,120
I delayed handing in the case because
I do want you to think well of my skills.

601
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,600
Fine.

602
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Come on. Well, am I good?

603
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,920
At least getting the credit to know
that this is bastard one objective.

604
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,800
Only to induce guilt so that I would
consent to you working case with me.

605
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,880
But is unfounded. Unfair?

606
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,000
Absolutely not true.

607
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,320
Just stop talking and bring the file.

608
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
For the last year, Dr.

609
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,080
Flint has been looking for land
to build an additional factory.

610
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
He found some cheap

611
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,720
wasteland in the East End, but it had
already been earmarked by a charity.

612
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,520
They were going to build a hospital
for the poor.

613
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,000
But Flint outbid them
and bought the land instead.

614
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,080
This is good work.

615
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,000
Indeed, Detective.

616
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,680
This charity would be called the Village
Trust by any chance.

617
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,080
The very one

618
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,560
list of members of this Village Trust.

619
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,040
Yes, sir.

620
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,960
Sir. Mr.

621
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,400
Doyle attends the fundraiser

622
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,600
for the Welsh Trust book,
which means he must support their cause.

623
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,360
Medicine for the poor.

624
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,200
And the same

625
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,520
which trust was the benevolent
association of Flint to build a hospital.

626
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,680
Until Flint stole the land.

627
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,080
Mr. Doyle

628
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,680
was also personally betrayed by Flint
when his father's name was taken off.

629
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,520
The remedy.

630
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,240
He should have bee upon it,
but instead is just a lowly assistant.

631
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,600
It sounds like we've

632
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,880
got our man, Mr.

633
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,520
Doyle.

634
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,920
Still breathing.

635
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,880
Just you

636
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,440
doing?

637
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,840
He's been poisoned.

638
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,040
How does how chauvinist.

639
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,320
I received this

640
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,720
same envelope.

641
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
Same typeface

642
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,760
from the blackmailer.

643
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,840
I could have told you that.

644
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,640
What does it say?

645
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,360
I haven't opened it
because I do not care what it says.

646
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,240
Whoever is doing this

647
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,720
is taking the only thing I care about.

648
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,480
He is the closest thing to a soap.

649
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,400
Cedric Nichols is a strong young man.

650
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:20,280
He will receive the best care here.

651
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,600
Understand her?

652
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,640
How is Mr.

653
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,960
Doyle really?

654
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,520
Extremely poorly.

655
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,480
If it was the kind of souls
Nicholas Doyle.

656
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,880
Thought of himself.

657
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,560
You speak of the Batman.

658
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,360
Really?

659
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,440
Dr. Flint should pay the money.

660
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,040
Demanded to stop this madness. Yes.

661
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,480
£2,000 is nothing to him.

662
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,680
My belief is he could be next to me.

663
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,040
Excuse me.

664
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,440
I must confer with the doctors here.

665
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,120
Fitzroy's made a list
of all the members of the wolves trust.

666
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,960
I don't need to see that sort of.

667
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,640
I know the that matters.

668
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,960
The curator
at the Royal Botanical Society.

669
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,760
Mr. Humphreys.

670
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,800
He had access to the poisonous plant.

671
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,280
The ancient invader.

672
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
And the poisons.

673
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,040
Luminous, you said? Indeed.

674
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,440
And this second blackmail letter
you mentioned.

675
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,480
But this is still sealed.

676
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Oh, well,
I thought it would enhance your story, Mr.

677
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,360
Sinclair.

678
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,040
The lady detective
so saw of the blackmailer.

679
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,480
She had no need to open the second letter.

680
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,320
Bravo, Miss Scarlett.

681
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,600
I do believe you have missed your calling.

682
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,320
You are a natural when it comes to the art
of spinning a story.

683
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,160
Almost as good as myself.

684
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
That is high praise, indeed.

685
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:50,840
Even the chief correspondent himself.

686
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,080
Oh, yes.

687
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,520
Just as I thought.

688
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,880
You see, Mr. Sinclair,

689
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,680
letter X has a distinctive, faulty
mark in both.

690
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,360
Just like the first blackmail letter.

691
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,840
Which means they were all typed
from the same typewriter.

692
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,400
Curator's typewriter? Precisely.

693
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
So this

694
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Humphreys had access to the poison
and to the typewriter that wrote

695
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,120
both of the blackmail letters.

696
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,440
And he was also a member
of the footage Trust.

697
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,480
They had a cheap plan to build a hospital,
but Dr.

698
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,880
Flint outbid them.

699
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,920
He bought the land for himself
to build a new factory instead.

700
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,640
This extortion was an act of revenge.

701
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,320
No witchcraft there?

702
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,840
No, I'm afraid not.

703
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,080
Although

704
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,480
the luminous quality of the poison
had a touch of black magic, does it not?

705
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,320
Indeed.

706
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm meeting is about to enter in precisely
one hour at the Botanical Society

707
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,520
when Mr. Humphreys will be arrest.

708
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:07,920
I assume you'd like to attend.

709
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,040
So you see, Dr.

710
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,680
Flint, my evidence points
quite firmly to Mr.

711
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,120
Humphreys here.

712
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Well, that's counter, Lieutenant.

713
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,280
I am no blackmailer. I'm a scholar.

714
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,240
I was just explained to my client,
Dr. Flint, how he deduced Mr.

715
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,440
Humphreys was the culprit.

716
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,360
You make sure you put our contact details
in your piece.

717
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,280
Sinclair will wish to pass up
an opportunity for promotion.

718
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,440
You were under the pay of Nash all along.

719
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,400
Mr. Nash,
as one of our most generous advertisers.

720
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,440
We must have our patrons where we can.

721
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,560
And sharing
my evidence is just the ticket.

722
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,520
That's a tad ungrateful, Miss Scarlett.

723
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,440
Without my bill,
you'd still be in a police cell.

724
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,240
You're
the reason I was there in the first place.

725
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,320
Why do you keep calling her Miss Scarlet?

726
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,680
This is Miss Belfry.

727
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,240
The lady that wished to join the society.

728
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,280
Because just as I am no police inspector.

729
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,320
Mr. Humphreys, this is no lady.

730
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,840
She is a private detective.

731
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,560
Impressive. Is she not

732
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,920
well?

733
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,360
I'd love to stay and chat,

734
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,920
but I'm afraid

735
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,040
I really must get on.

736
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,120
Let's take him down to Scotland Yard.

737
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,280
Please. Please.

738
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,680
There's been a terrible mistake.

739
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,240
Dr. Flint.

740
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,600
I knew Mr.

741
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,720
Sinclair was double crossing me.

742
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,760
That's why I lied to him to mislead Nash.

743
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,840
Mr. Humphreys is not your blacksmith.

744
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,200
But the typewriter.

745
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,640
That particular make the Remington first

746
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,760
edition has a common fault
with this letter X.

747
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,480
If Humphreys is not the blackmailer,

748
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,920
then who is?

749
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,760
Hey, mister.

750
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
How could you do this to me?

751
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,040
We're going to build a hospital.

752
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,120
A place where the poor
could finally be nursed and looked after.

753
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,000
We've spent years
fundraising to buy that piece of land

754
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,160
somewhere we could finally afford.

755
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,800
Then you come along and take it from us
because it was cheap.

756
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,240
Cheap, heliocentric.

757
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,200
The money Dr.

758
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,800
Stanhope demanded
was to be funneled back into the charity.

759
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,840
As recompense for what they paid out
in planning permission

760
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,560
and architect's drawings over the years,

761
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,040
but also have gone some way
to finding another site for the hospital.

762
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,840
How did you know it was him?

763
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,680
Well, he knew the increased amount

764
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,200
the blackmailer was demanding
without having seen the letter

765
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,280
sealed until I opened it in my office.

766
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,560
And contrary to what I told Mr.

767
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,000
Sinclair, Mr.

768
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,280
Humphries is not a member of the witness
trust.

769
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,760
But Dr. Stanhope is.

770
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,120
He's the chairman.

771
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,840
He's also on the board of the Botanical
Society and had access to the poison.

772
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,560
I found.

773
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,040
About McManus.

774
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,960
Dr. Stanhope administered
a mild dose of poison.

775
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,200
His intention was to render Mr.

776
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Doyle unconscious not to kill him.

777
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,680
I have

778
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,400
reinstated your father's name on that.

779
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,880
And who will be my partner?

780
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,360
No, she's right.

781
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,000
I want her company to buy that land
and to donate it

782
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,440
to the hospital for
the poor can still be built.

783
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,600
And they should donate using your father's
name.

784
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
My friend.

785
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:46,360
My dear friend.

786
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,680
I will never trust that Toad
Sinclair again.

787
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,240
Why do you trust him in the first place?

788
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,840
As a mystery to me.

789
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,920
I heard what you did for young

790
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,120
Fitzroy,
pulling him from that raid on a gang.

791
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,520
Cannot speak highly enough of you.

792
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,280
They're not just a gang.

793
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,320
They are the most brutal criminals
in the city.

794
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,240
He's very lucky to have got them.

795
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,600
Please don't give me that indulgent smile.

796
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,960
Self-Indulgence, affection.

797
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,840
Of course it is, William.

798
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,480
Do not presume to be able to read my mind.

799
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,040
If I could, then I'm quite sure

800
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,840
that we would never speak again.

801
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,080
To give my best to Mr.

802
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,200
Potts. I'm not going to the military.

803
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,240
I know, I know.

804
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,480
But from what I've seen,
I look at frequent visits and I seems

805
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,960
critical of the

806
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,440
Miss Scarlet Detective Fitzroy.

807
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,720
And drag your eyes from the Scarlet
from woman to fraud case has just.

808
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,200
Come on, Detective. Yes, sir.

809
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,360
The Jeweler's and Montgomery Street
and Blue.

810
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,720
And get everything you can find them.

811
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,680
Yes, sir.

812
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,920
Inspector,

813
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,080
I hear you plucked John Fitzroy from
Detective Phelps to assist you instead.

814
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,600
Yes, sir.

815
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,600
He has encyclopedic knowledge on poisoned
sciences, insight on a case cycle.

816
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,360
Peter, you say. Hmm.

817
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Impressive.

818
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,120
We'll get to it, Detective.

819
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,800
Yes, sir.

820
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,880
You disobeyed another direct
order, Inspector.

821
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,760
I apologize, but I didn't.

822
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,120
I was born on the streets
of Glasgow, just like you.

823
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,040
And I was supposed the day I was born,

824
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,240
to not assume my comfortable position
here.

825
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,520
Who's telling me otherwise?

826
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,440
Commissioner,
I have a whiskey with your name on it.

827
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,720
Waiting on my desk. Oh,
I hope it's a large one.

828
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,160
Large and strong.

829
00:42:43,160 --> 00:43:01,920
It's just how I like my woman.

830
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,000
The Scarlet

831
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,320
Witch, to congratulate you in person
on your magnificent with my pleasure.

832
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,240
Thank you.

833
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,040
How nice to have the opportunity
to wish you commiserations in person.

834
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,840
This match for, I believe this evening's
edition of the Illustrated Fools News

835
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,680
will be leaving the princess on its way
to be devoured by its readership.

836
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,600
Only later to discover
that the genius, Mr.

837
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,840
Lash, keeps the wrong man.

838
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,400
No matter.

839
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,960
Sinclair released an apology
to Mr. Humphries in the next edition.

840
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,160
Oh, I think you'll find that a man
such as Mr.

841
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,680
Humphries
will want a little more than that.

842
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,960
A lawsuit, perhaps.

843
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,240
What woman
you are not afraid of even more.

844
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,400
I could have you work for me than ever.

845
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,640
Well, my answer is still no.

846
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,000
Then what can I do
to make you change your mind?

847
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,320
Nothing.

848
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,640
There's always something.

849
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,160
Even you,
Miss Scarlet, will have your price.

850
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,640
I suppose a contract blackmail.

851
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,960
However, perhaps I'd rather
you come to me willingly

852
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,360
not to coerced.

853
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,440
I can play as dirty as you, sir.

854
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,880
So believe me when I say

855
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,440
you do not me as an enemy.

856
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,800
No. I want you as my employee

857
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,160
to take some time.

858
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,680
But we offer.

859
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,000
Until then.

860
00:44:32,240 --> 00:45:22,600
It's not so.
