1
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:06,043
Once again, I'm most grateful you
have given me your precious time

2
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:08,383
so that I may explain a little
more about my profession

3
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:10,383
and how it may interest
the ladies of your group.

4
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:12,073
It is not a group.

5
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:17,253
Miss Scarlet. Group is a noun
that conveys neither the purpose

6
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:19,833
nor the quality
of our membership.

7
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:22,376
We are a cultural society,

8
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:25,602
The Bloomsbury Ladies
Cultural Society.

9
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:26,702
Duly noted, Mrs Parker.

10
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:31,823
As I was saying, I would like to give
a lecture to your cultural society,

11
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,553
revealing the fascinating
world of the private detective.

12
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:37,433
Brought to life with stories
from my own casebook.

13
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,173
My intention is to
inspire your ladies.

14
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:43,819
I don't wish to sound boastful,

15
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,933
but I am the only female
detective in London.

16
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:48,763
Which is no doubt the reason
for the calibre of your clients.

17
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:50,593
The calibre of my clients?

18
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:54,223
It is our understanding that
you are engaged by the desperate

19
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:57,833
and impoverished who cannot afford
to hire your male counterparts.

20
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:02,033
I can assure you I've had many clients
who are neither of those things.

21
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:06,943
Perhaps not, but I would wager
that those clients had cases

22
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:09,983
that were deemed too lowly
to be taken on elsewhere.

23
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:13,363
You were suggesting I'm
regarded as somehow second rate.

24
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:16,453
I'm merely pointing out
that if we endorse you,

25
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:20,813
it may have implications for
the reputation at the society.

26
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:26,083
I completely
understand Mrs Parker.

27
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:29,523
Once a reputation is lost,
it's so very hard to get back.

28
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:32,349
Which is why you can
rest assured Mrs. Forbes

29
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,534
that I will reveal to no one

30
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,123
the real reason your
son left the Navy.

31
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:37,723
How dare you!

32
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,459
And you have my
word Mrs Woodhouse,

33
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,333
that it will not be from me

34
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:42,549
that others hear of your late
husband's gambling debts,

35
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:44,873
which are I believe only
exceeded by the money he owes

36
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,383
to the brothels of Canning Town.

37
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:57,393
So how did it go?

38
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:49,933
Where is he?

39
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,793
This goes no
further. Understood?

40
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:08,343
Fitzroy.

41
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,433
Get up.

42
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:16,283
I said get up!

43
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,073
You gonna steady 'em, lad?

44
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,243
Look at me Fitzroy.

45
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:31,923
Look at me.

46
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:33,123
How many fingers?

47
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:36,353
Four. No, it's three.

48
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,893
It's three, it's three.

49
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:40,103
Is that a guess?

50
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:41,983
No.

51
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:43,979
I want you to listen carefully.

52
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:44,893
Detective Fitzroy.

53
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,739
I don't give a damn what
you do in your private life,

54
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:49,953
but when you're on duty you turn
up on time in a fit state to work.

55
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:54,573
Now I have been ordered to turn you into
a competent detective and God help me

56
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:58,203
you will toe the line and do as
you're told. Is that understood?

57
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:01,163
Good.

58
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:04,253
Clean yourself up man.

59
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:08,239
I could tell them till
I was blue in the face

60
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,763
that I'm hired on merit but
does it make a difference?

61
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:11,913
Of course not.

62
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:13,493
Yes, I have taken on a few cases

63
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:15,213
which are not paying
the full going rate,

64
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,283
but to suggest that it's

65
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,863
because I'm a woman and somehow
desperate is simply not true.

66
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,421
Is it, Hattie?

67
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,644
Absolutely not true, at all.

68
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:24,834
Although..
- Although?

69
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,543
Although perhaps you should not
have upset my aunt like that,

70
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,393
You do not want to
make an enemy of her.

71
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:32,113
I've suffered your Aunt's wrath
before and lived to tell the tale.

72
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:33,273
Yes, but this is different.

73
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,587
You embarrassed her in front of
her ladies of the Cultural Society,

74
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,743
her very best friends.

75
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,669
I suppose it's nice to hear that
she actually likes somebody.

76
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:41,983
Oh no, she loaths them,

77
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:44,049
but you must be on
your guard, Eliza.

78
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:47,013
My aunt does have
friends in high places

79
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:49,743
and mark my words she
will seek revenge.

80
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,633
Do any of these friends in
high places wear top hats?

81
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,403
I do not know a Mrs Parker

82
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:05,593
I have come to see you
on my own volition.

83
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,953
Well, in that case,

84
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,583
How may I help you, Mr Swab?

85
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:18,533
I am a partner at Swab and
Durstin, an insurance firm

86
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:21,343
based in Holborn. We
provide cover for the lives

87
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,389
and properties of our
clients, protecting them from

88
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:24,833
all the slings and arrows

89
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:25,592
that life may throw.

90
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:26,893
In return for a monthly fee,

91
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:29,955
they receive an insurance
policy, which means..

92
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:33,227
I believe I understand how the
insurance industry works, Mr Swab.

93
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,553
What is it I can do for you?

94
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,821
Last night an item of
considerable value was stolen

95
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,810
from one of our policyholders.

96
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:49,369
A sketch of the alscalapha
odorata or black witch moth

97
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:52,953
drawn from life on the
Galapagos Islands in 1835.

98
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,835
During Darwin's voyage?

99
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:57,858
Most of the Galapagos
sketches were drawn

100
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,164
by the expedition's
artist Conrad Martin,

101
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:03,123
but this was by
Charles Darwin himself.

102
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:06,743
As you can imagine, the
value of his artwork

103
00:06:06,823 --> 00:06:09,283
has soared since his
death earlier this year,

104
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:12,712
and as such we are facing
a significant payout.

105
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:15,353
Just to be clear, I will be
charging the full going rate.

106
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,740
I would expect nothing less.

107
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Good.

108
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,231
So tell me Mr. Swab..

109
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,140
Where was this sketch stolen?

110
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:31,603
No sign of forced entry and
no other exhibit stolen.

111
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,583
Whoever did this knew what
they were looking for,

112
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,663
but why go to the bother to take
the sketch out of the frame?

113
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:37,823
What does this tell you?

114
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,483
When I ask a question,
I expect an answer,

115
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:45,602
Detective Fitzroy - Yes, Sir.

116
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,933
You must learn to
analyse a crime scene

117
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:51,559
and that involves more
than just taking notes.

118
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,043
Start using your initiative man.

119
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:58,973
The fact that they didn't take
the frame means they had time.

120
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,904
There was no panic to
snatch and grab, Sir.

121
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:03,004
Good.

122
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:06,364
What was it called
again, the moth?

123
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,413
Alscalapha odorata.

124
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:12,043
Found in central
and south America

125
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,853
it's believed by some native cultures to
be a harbinger of death and destruction.

126
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:17,872
Miss Scarlet.

127
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:19,329
Inspector Wellington.

128
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:21,433
I take it this
isn't a coincidence.

129
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:24,794
I've been hired by the insurance company to
investigate the theft of the Darwin sketch.

130
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,138
And what do they
think I'm doing?

131
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,723
This may come as a surprise
Inspector Wellington

132
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:30,563
but myself and my client
did not discuss you.

133
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:31,876
We're done here.

134
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:34,933
We have other lines
of enquiry to pursue.

135
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:36,493
Such as?

136
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:41,265
I must understand that you're
asking for my help... already?

137
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,413
I'm merely making
polite conversation.

138
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,543
Although given the circumstances, I
can see how that can be misconstrued.

139
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:50,543
After all, we are in
competition, are we not?

140
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,089
The owner of the museum
is Hannah Garret.

141
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:56,419
Where would I find her?

142
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:59,963
Is this another request for help or are
we still making polite conversation?

143
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,133
Detective Fitzroy.

144
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,088
Sir, are you and her...?

145
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,984
No, and your
handwriting's illegible.

146
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,884
I'm afraid we are
closed for the day.

147
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:29,553
We'll reopen in the morning.

148
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:30,133
Miss Garret.

149
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,753
Yes, my name is Miss Scarlet.

150
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,633
I'm here on behalf
of your insurance.

151
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,485
It's standard practice
for an insurance company

152
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,168
to carry out their
investigation.

153
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:42,363
And they sent a woman?

154
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,716
Meaning?

155
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,843
Meaning you would be better
placed to gain my trust.

156
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:50,043
Do they really suspect me of
stealing the sketch myself?

157
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:53,061
I was sent Miss Garret for no other
reason than that I'm good at my job,

158
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,085
as I'm sure are you.

159
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:59,333
I am sorry if I was rude.

160
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:04,303
I run the museum on my own and
it is an all consuming venture.

161
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:06,826
It can make me tired and..

162
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:08,161
Somewhat cynical.

163
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,283
So tell me about the theft.

164
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:12,703
It happened overnight.

165
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:14,343
There was no sign of a break in.

166
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,523
Nothing else was taken.

167
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,083
Whoever stole it knew
the truth of the matter.

168
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,643
The sketch was the only
thing of real value here.

169
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,883
How did you come to
own the Darwin sketch?

170
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,593
I attended a lecture he gave at the
Royal Institution a few years ago.

171
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:33,873
I asked him a question on
the inherited characteristics

172
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:34,803
of the Black Witch moth.

173
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:35,823
He was so modest.

174
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:37,303
He admitted that
he did not know.

175
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,223
But two weeks later a
package arrived with a letter

176
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,233
answering my question and..

177
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,673
The sketch he'd drawn
on the Galapagos.

178
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:51,604
Thomas was furious.

179
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:52,704
Thomas?

180
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,243
My husband, Thomas Dashwood.

181
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:56,769
The naturalist.

182
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,423
He has an impressive reputation.

183
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,232
He used to encourage
my passion for science,

184
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,912
but as my knowledge grew,

185
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,223
so did his displeasure.

186
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:08,893
He wanted a pupil,
not a partner.

187
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,474
When I set up the museum

188
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:13,153
he resented me for it.

189
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,523
But do you go by your your
maiden name of Garret?

190
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:20,043
You're divorced?

191
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:21,346
Separated.

192
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,223
I would divorce, but..

193
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:27,173
The costs, both
financial and otherwise..

194
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,963
Let's just say it is
a high price to pay.

195
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:36,303
So where would I
find your husband?

196
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:39,460
Careful with that.

197
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,886
Just one of those is worth
more than your yearly wage.

198
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:42,994
Sorry Sir.

199
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:44,557
There's a lady here.

200
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,854
Mr. Dashwood?

201
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,291
My name's Eliza Scarlet.

202
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,877
Whoever you are, it is customary
to wait until invited in.

203
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:54,332
Sorry Sir.

204
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:59,106
How many times have I told you
- that maid must be dismissed?

205
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,527
Many times.

206
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,557
Forgive the intrusion
Mr Dashwood,

207
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,707
but I hoped you might have
a spare moment to talk.

208
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:08,425
I most certainly do not.

209
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,503
I'm giving a lecture at
the Royal Institution

210
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,839
and yet again I'm
behind schedule.

211
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,339
Take those out to the carriage.

212
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,947
It concerns your wife.

213
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:23,828
I'm attempting to recover
the Darwin sketch.

214
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:27,941
The sole intention of that woman
is to humiliate and antagonise me.

215
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:31,687
I've already spoken to the police
and will not explain myself to you,

216
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,650
whoever the hell you are.

217
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:37,728
If you want to speak to me about
my wife, get yourself a lawyer.

218
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:40,986
You saw yourself in.

219
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,236
You can see yourself out.

220
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:50,346
I would say he's not normally like
this, but that would be a lie.

221
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,565
Who are you exactly?

222
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,388
I'm a private investigator.

223
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:56,613
So you're good with clues:

224
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,106
'ostentatiously lofty in style'

225
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,557
- begins with the letter B.

226
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,906
A word puzzle makes
the day go faster.

227
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:06,875
That and a bottle of schnapps.

228
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,223
Can I get you something?

229
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:12,833
A new pair of lungs.

230
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,192
Thank you, thank you.

231
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:21,177
Please sit.

232
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:38,657
Usually I receive a look of
disdain when I light my pipe.

233
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,804
Never quite sure whether it is the
fact that I am a lady and smoking

234
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:49,086
or that I'm an unwell
lady and smoking.

235
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,427
It could be just
that I'm German.

236
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:54,221
I've lived here for 50 years,

237
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,510
yet still treated
like a foreigner.

238
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:59,427
I would wager it's all
three of those things.

239
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,918
A female private detective,
now that is a puzzle.

240
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,221
Well, I've been employed
by the insurance company

241
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,543
to investigate Miss
Garret's Darwin sketch.

242
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:13,269
Last I heard my daughter in
law's name was still Dashwood.

243
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,192
But if you wish to
deal with my son,

244
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:20,906
you will have to have more
assertiveness than that, young lady.

245
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:24,021
He is ..
- Bombastic

246
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:27,492
I beg your pardon?
- 'Ostentatiously lofty in style'

247
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:29,063
Bombastic

248
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,297
Bombastic!

249
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:38,591
Yes, it is a good job you
were here, Miss Scarlet.

250
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,750
You finish it.

251
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:45,375
My son does not approve of
my penchant for word play.

252
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:48,835
I believe

253
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,585
I should take a nap.

254
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:59,877
I will have my maid see you out.

255
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:07,522
Why?

256
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:11,962
Sorry..

257
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:16,882
Excuse me..

258
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:20,052
Hattie..

259
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:22,386
What on earth is going on?

260
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,465
I have no idea.

261
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:26,160
I just popped in to say hello
and I found them waiting outside.

262
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,720
They keep saying they found it.

263
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:28,782
They found it.

264
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,618
Found what?

265
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:39,977
They're all fakes.

266
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:42,773
You don't say?

267
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:45,800
And why send them your office?

268
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,592
The advert on the
bottom of page 5.

269
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:53,104
Stolen sketch of the black
witch moth by Mr Charles Darwin.

270
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,925
A reward of £1000 is offered

271
00:14:55,941 --> 00:15:01,128
for its safe return to Miss Eliza
Scarlet of 43 Ebury Lane, London.

272
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:02,672
It wasn't me who placed it.

273
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:06,216
The sketch is worth £500, yet
this offer is twice that amount.

274
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,437
Unless of course Miss Garret had
a sentimental attachment to it.

275
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:11,610
Perhaps it was worth
placing the advert.

276
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,735
I doubt she has
that kind of money.

277
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,182
And even if she did,

278
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,207
why use my address
and not the museum's?

279
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:19,238
She's not my client. The
insurance company are.

280
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:20,915
Which is curious in itself.

281
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:21,915
What is?

282
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:23,500
That the insurance
company would hire you.

283
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:24,461
There must be a reason.

284
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,332
Because I'm good at my
job, that's the reason.

285
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,137
All I meant is that they
may suspect Miss Garret

286
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,292
and they hired a woman
to gain her trust.

287
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:33,982
Where are you going?

288
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:35,583
I'm coming with you.

289
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:36,583
Where am I going?

290
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:37,668
To reception.

291
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:39,468
I sent a message to someone
we need to question.

292
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:40,778
He should have arrived by now.

293
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:44,099
Eliza do I need to remind you that
this is my place of work, not yours.

294
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:45,114
Who is it anyway?

295
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,452
A journalist at the
Illustrated Police News.

296
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:49,483
Basil Sinclair.

297
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:51,905
Please God, not him..

298
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,012
The advertisement was
placed anonymously.

299
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,502
We received a letter containing

300
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:58,471
only the wording and the
required date of publication.

301
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:00,072
When was this?

302
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:01,268
Yesterday, in the Evening Post,

303
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,947
a little before 6:00 o'clock.

304
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,336
As chief correspondent,

305
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,205
my editor, Mr Smythe came to me.

306
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,611
'Basil, ' he said, 'no one knows
more of Mr Darwin it than you do'.

307
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:13,542
'You must help the police
in their hour of need'.

308
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,902
So the advert was placed
before the robbery happened?

309
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:18,972
My heart soars at the prospect
of our esteemed publication

310
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:21,567
being center stage of such
an intriguing mystery.

311
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,387
It's not a mystery,
Mr Sinclair..

312
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,287
It is a theft.

313
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,707
There will be a perfectly rational
explanation to all of this.

314
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:31,162
Stolen artwork from the
great Charles Darwin himself.

315
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:34,127
Scotland Yard forced yet again

316
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:36,089
to turn to the lady detective.

317
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:38,057
Miss Scarlet's not
working for Scotland Yard.

318
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:40,556
I've been hired by
the insurance company

319
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,218
who wished to carry out
their own investigation.

320
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:44,523
My dear Miss Scarlet, I feel
you may have proved my point.

321
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,743
Is it not precisely due to a
lack of faith in the police

322
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:51,071
that you are hired
in the first place.

323
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,646
As requested, Sir, I've been
perusing previous fraud cases.

324
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,575
I've secured an address
for that art dealer.

325
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:00,232
Art dealer, you say?

326
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:01,856
And who might that be?

327
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:08,032
Let me ask you a question

328
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:11,795
and I want you to think very
carefully before you answer.

329
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,091
Are you trying to make
my life difficult?

330
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:14,997
Sir?

331
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:18,392
Never show your findings in
front of anyone else but me.

332
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:19,672
Think before you speak.

333
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:24,138
In fact, better still, don't speak
all unless I explicitly tell you to.

334
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:29,587
You're looking rather warm
detective. Are you unwell?

335
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:33,102
No, Sir, perhaps it's the clement
weather we're enjoying at present.

336
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,705
Take my advice
Detective Fitzroy.

337
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:35,632
If you wish to fit in here,

338
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,432
stop using words like clement.

339
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:38,508
Yes Sir, sorry Sir.

340
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,541
Stop apologising
every five minutes.

341
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:44,817
Alert my cab that I'll be
going to Bethnal Green.

342
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:49,282
Miss Scarlet.

343
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:50,770
Detective Fitzroy.

344
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:54,795
Well get to it, man.

345
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:01,053
May I offer you some
constructive criticism?

346
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:02,923
No.

347
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,282
At times you might be a
little more approachable,

348
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:08,580
particularly with those
who are your subordinates.

349
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:09,987
That nice young man
looks like he could do

350
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:11,127
with the occasional 'well done'.

351
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:14,189
Have you ever been anyone's
superior, apart from your housemaids?

352
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:15,089
No, but...

353
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:17,792
Well, please keep your
constructive criticism to yourself.

354
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,891
This dealer you're going to see.

355
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,165
I'm assuming he's connected
to the black market somehow.

356
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,052
Perhaps someone with previous
convictions for trading in stolen art.

357
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:35,865
Good I'm right.

358
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:39,092
There's no expression you
possess that I cannot read.

359
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,488
William, I know
we're in competition,

360
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,632
but when all is said and
done we are on the same side.

361
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:44,912
The side of the law,

362
00:18:44,952 --> 00:18:46,600
We're on the same
side when it suits you

363
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,318
and I don't trust you
when you sound so noble.

364
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,468
Whoever placed this advert knew exactly
when the sketch was going to be stolen.

365
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:54,528
I'd like to go back to the museum
and speak to Miss Garret again,

366
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,702
and I suspect you would too.

367
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:58,481
We'd save ourselves time
if we shared our resources.

368
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:00,122
You speak to this dealer.

369
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:02,892
I'll go to the museum and we'll
meet up later to share our findings.

370
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:04,235
No.

371
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:05,946
Very well.

372
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,308
Then perhaps I'll team up
with our journalist friend

373
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:11,128
and share my
observations with him.

374
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:14,339
And not just about the
case, but wider stories too,

375
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:18,253
like the time you were drunk on
duty and lost your warrant card.

376
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,364
How the hell do you
find these things out?

377
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:21,590
People speak to me.

378
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:23,492
It's my woman's
approachable manner.

379
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,839
Fine.

380
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,167
Ridiculous.

381
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:36,869
Why would I do such a thing?

382
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:40,650
To claim the money from the insurance
and prop up your failing business.

383
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,947
It's NOT failing!

384
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:45,072
There are leaks in the roof,

385
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,400
paint peeling from the walls

386
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,860
and exhibits falling to pieces.

387
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:53,860
You cannot afford to run this place,
but you're too stubborn to sell it.

388
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:56,442
I will expose you
for what you are.

389
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:58,942
A thief!

390
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,863
Get out NOW!

391
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:43,110
I deal in legitimate works of
art sold with full provenance.

392
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:47,210
In fact Inspector, I am insulted
that you would even ask.

393
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,452
My apologies Mr Gibson.

394
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:51,803
I assume that man with 12
convictions for handling stolen goods

395
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,249
and three for fraud might be
the right person to talk to.

396
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,575
That was all in my past.

397
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:57,888
I'm a changed man.

398
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:59,794
Your last conviction
was six weeks ago.

399
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:03,105
So perhaps you can -
what was your phrase?

400
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:06,187
'Legitimate works of art
with full provenance'..

401
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:07,595
They are.

402
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:10,571
In that case I shall
have to check that is so.

403
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,928
You'll have to be kept in
custody in the meantime.

404
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:17,420
Now I think about it, there
is one person comes to mind.

405
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:18,889
I thought there might be.

406
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:21,901
Yeah, this is the man you want.

407
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:25,565
He deals in specialist
works of art.

408
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:27,151
Like the one that was stolen.

409
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:30,278
I don't know his real name,
that's what they call him.

410
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,450
The Count?

411
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:19,572
Why are you following me?

412
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,336
I wasn't following you.

413
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:23,125
I lost my way.

414
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:25,357
You were watching
me in the tavern.

415
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:27,177
Tell me who you are

416
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:28,547
or I will shoot you in the head.

417
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:31,837
No, you will not.

418
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,277
Why is that then?

419
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:36,217
Because there's a police
officer standing behind you.

420
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,586
Do you think I'm an idiot?

421
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:42,897
Yes.

422
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,313
Since you ask.

423
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:50,948
Was Miss Garret trying to
sell you the Darwin sketch?

424
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:53,717
I know nothing of this
sketch you speak of,

425
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:56,857
but I suggest you
tread very carefully.

426
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,377
And why is that exactly?

427
00:22:58,507 --> 00:22:59,587
Because I'm a Basinski.

428
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:03,747
My family is one of the oldest
dynasties in Hungarian nobility.

429
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:06,524
Am I supposed to be impressed?

430
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:11,235
Merely warning you that I
have influential friends.

431
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,237
I suggest you
answer the question

432
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:20,582
or Inspector Wellington here will
take your leg and use it for firewood.

433
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:26,593
No, Miss Garret was not selling.

434
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:29,641
She was trying to buy, but I
told her I did not have it.

435
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:32,047
That conversation seemed to
take an awfully long time.

436
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,164
That is because she did
not believe me at first.

437
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:35,413
She thought I was bargaining.

438
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,381
She had no money to offer, only
a few exhibits from the museum.

439
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:39,753
Worthless, mostly.

440
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,047
The woman is desperate,

441
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,569
so I told her if I heard
anything I will let her know.

442
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:45,317
And have you heard anything?

443
00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:47,187
Not a word.

444
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:49,649
Getting rather chilly in here.

445
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,899
Don't you agree, Miss Scarlet?

446
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:54,602
I think perhaps the fire
might need a little help.

447
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:56,507
Very well.

448
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:00,174
I have heard one or two things.

449
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,790
About Miss Garret?
- About her husband.

450
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:06,427
They say he pays extremely
well, no questions asked.

451
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:10,099
You want to find that sketch.

452
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:13,466
I know where I would be looking.

453
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:19,504
I'm going to a
magistrate first thing..

454
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:21,594
Get a warrant to search
Dashwood's house.

455
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:22,897
I'll meet you there.

456
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,694
It's difficult enough
without any added irritation.

457
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,803
So I'm an irritation now, am I?

458
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:30,097
I really mean it's better
to keep things simple.

459
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:33,527
You'll wait for me to contact you with
an update on how her research went..

460
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,646
And that is my final
word on the matter.

461
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,810
I'll find the sketch,
then I will make sure

462
00:24:37,835 --> 00:24:40,056
that your employers know your
part in the investigation.

463
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:43,829
You'll still receive your fee,
unless this is more about your ego.

464
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,637
Do you really wish
to talk about ego?

465
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:47,213
Sir...

466
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:49,787
There's a Dutch
gentleman a Mr Lohman,

467
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,083
waiting for you in your office.

468
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:53,061
He'd like to discuss
the Darwin case.

469
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:56,957
Mr. Lohman

470
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:04,927
From Woban and Holst, the company
who insured the stolen picture.

471
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:08,287
No, the insurance firm
is Swab and Durstin.

472
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:10,462
Here..

473
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:13,204
See, I was visited by
one of the partners.

474
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:15,040
I have never heard
of such a company.

475
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:16,501
Describe the man you met.

476
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:20,728
Small in stature,
Welsh accent, top hat

477
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,861
and he had a slight
birthmark on his forehead.

478
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:25,493
Whoever he is, he does
not work for my company.

479
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:27,814
Well if he didn't
hire me, then who did?

480
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:42,192
Why would this man give you a card
for a business that does not exist?

481
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:43,575
It does not make any sense.

482
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,371
Hattie, it's always
nice to see you,

483
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,403
but you really cannot
keep popping in like this.

484
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,084
It's a very nice card to boot.

485
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:52,577
It's subtle, that bold embossing.
My father was in the ink business

486
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:57,288
and there was nothing that comes close
to my passion than a well chosen font.

487
00:25:58,287 --> 00:25:59,767
Oh well, then perhaps
you can help me.

488
00:26:00,397 --> 00:26:02,449
I need to find out who
ordered these cards.

489
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:05,714
Hattie?

490
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:09,407
You want me to help you?

491
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,935
I mean like an assistant?

492
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,512
Yes, if you like.

493
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:17,169
I will take you to every
stationer's in town, Eliza

494
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:20,119
and on the way I shall explain
the twelve types of calligraphy.

495
00:26:20,457 --> 00:26:21,510
I can hardly wait.

496
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,347
Well?

497
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:32,437
What's the matter with her?

498
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:33,518
Sir...

499
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,166
What is it now?

500
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,300
What the hell is this?

501
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:43,440
We have a warrant to
search these premises sir.

502
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:46,644
My mother is extremely ill
and you come marching in...

503
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:48,512
We were let in by your maid.

504
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:51,467
I have said all I have
to say on this matter.

505
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:53,607
You've no just cause to be here.

506
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:56,672
Mr Dashwood I would request that
you control your temper, sir.

507
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,084
Right!

508
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:05,913
Fitzroy... Fitzroy!

509
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:08,140
What on Earth is going on here?

510
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:25,091
Ah Wellington. How are we?

511
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:27,029
Fine, thank you Sir.

512
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,857
How's young Fitzroy getting on?

513
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:33,819
Actually Sir, he's uh..

514
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,123
He's doing very well.

515
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:40,826
Glad to hear it.

516
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,287
Commissioner asked me to
check in on him. Is he around?

517
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,237
Not at the moment, Sir.

518
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:48,057
He is out assisting me on
the Darwin investigation.

519
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,207
You're happy with
his progress, yes?

520
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:52,053
He still has a lot
to learn, but yes..

521
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:54,499
Glad to hear it. I'll
let his father know.

522
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:55,577
Keep up the good work.

523
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,967
I am acting as consultant

524
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,817
to Miss Scarlet's extremely
important investigation.

525
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:07,257
Given my considerable expertise
in the business of stationary,

526
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:11,957
I do not boast when I say that I have
an encyclopedic knowledge of embossing,

527
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,457
calligraphy, kerning,

528
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,117
and the jewel in the crown
of any calling card -

529
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:17,347
the font.

530
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:19,067
My particular favour...

531
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:22,825
Was this card made
on these premises?

532
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,431
One moment please..

533
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:29,850
Hattie, may I ask you be more
economical with your conversation?

534
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:31,787
Economical?
- Keep quiet!

535
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,977
We sold a book last week.

536
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:42,336
Do you remember who to?

537
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:46,128
Mr Reginald Booth

538
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,957
I spoke to Wellington. I understand
you wish to speak with me.

539
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:40,537
I am here on behalf of my
clients, the Dashwood family.

540
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:43,058
I am their legal
counsel and as such

541
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,657
Mr Thomas Dashwood
has asked me to relay

542
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:49,217
the sad news of the
passing of his mother.

543
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:51,318
My condolences.

544
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:53,627
Mrs Dashwood has been
ill for some time

545
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:55,477
so it is not
completely unexpected,

546
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,216
but still a terrible
blow to her son.

547
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,197
As you can imagine, he
is stricken with grief

548
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:06,336
and requests that you desist
from harassing him any further.

549
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,487
Does he now?

550
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:10,758
He has asked me to point out
that he is a man of wealth

551
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:14,643
who could fund the most
thorough of legal challenges.

552
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:19,274
I would advise that any future
communications come directly through myself.

553
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,159
I bid you a good day, Sir.

554
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:30,601
So the Welsh accent
I detect Mr Booth.

555
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,608
I fail to see the relevance.

556
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:36,546
Is it not customary to remove
one's hat when indoors?

557
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:41,280
I am a busy man with many other
appointments to attend, Inspector.

558
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:44,207
You offend me sir.

559
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,024
Kindly take it off.

560
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:48,221
This is quite ridiculous.

561
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:49,717
My car is waiting outside.

562
00:30:49,742 --> 00:30:51,604
Either you take off your hat

563
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,292
or I'll take it off for you.

564
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,502
I believe you know,
an associate of mine.

565
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:04,337
Miss Scarlet.

566
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:45,617
Well.

567
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,046
Seems you are who
you claim to be.

568
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:53,054
Mr Reginald Booth, solicitor,
of 28 Westerly Row.

569
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,506
So tell me why you
were impersonating

570
00:32:57,623 --> 00:33:00,701
a Mr. Swab who works for
a bogus insurance fund.

571
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:04,201
I deny any such accusation

572
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:05,623
and furthermore would ask

573
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:07,007
if I am under arrest.

574
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,866
If so, you have
failed to mention it.

575
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,257
You're free to go at any time,

576
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:14,307
Mr Booth, just as I am free
to go to the Law Society

577
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,218
and report you for fraud.

578
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:23,557
I have worked for the Dashwood
family for some years,

579
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,754
at first for
Mr. Dashwood's late father,

580
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:29,356
then latterly for
Mr. Dashwood himself.

581
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:33,676
I am paid for my
diligence and compliance.

582
00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:35,371
You mean you do
what you're told?

583
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,746
I do my best for
my clients, yes.

584
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:42,007
And what interest did Thomas
Dashwood have in Miss Scarlet?

585
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:46,387
It was not Thomas Dashwood
who told me to visit her.

586
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,298
The Temple of Karnak..

587
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:41,003
So missus Dashwood was
an intrepid explorer,

588
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,144
Very much left out
of the history books.

589
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:45,055
I've done some research and
there's no mention of her

590
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,105
among the otherwise
male archaeology team.

591
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:49,980
The lawyer said when her family
married her off to a rich,

592
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,219
much older English husband,

593
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:54,888
he insisted that she stay at home
and behave more appropriately.

594
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,339
I can see why she liked you.

595
00:34:57,785 --> 00:35:01,029
Then when her husband died, she
hoped to rekindle her passion

596
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,793
for the natural sciences.

597
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,816
Her son was a chip
off the old block.

598
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,197
He didn't want her
tainting his own career.

599
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:09,548
Something he tried to
inflict on his wife too.

600
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:14,239
If Mrs Dashwood is the one that got
that journalist, Sinclair, involved

601
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:16,618
then she clearly wanted
to create a story.

602
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,571
And yet, I can't quite
work out her plan.

603
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:21,876
It's a puzzle.

604
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:23,092
It certainly is

605
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:25,470
No, I mean, there's a puzzle.

606
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:26,876
The discovery of
the Karnak King List

607
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,687
was famous for the
race to find it.

608
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,699
It involved decyphering
maps, hieroglyphic riddles..

609
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:33,660
How Mrs Dashwood
loved to riddle.

610
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:35,595
When I met her she was trying
to compete a word game.

611
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,980
I helped with a clue.

612
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,609
Maybe the enigmatic Mrs Dashwood died
before her puzzle came to fruition.

613
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:46,549
It's late, we should pick
this up in the morning.

614
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:48,959
I'll see you home.

615
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,487
Seven letter puzzle.

616
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,279
Anagram

617
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:02,513
Exactly.

618
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,373
I think I know where
the Darwin sketch is.

619
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:12,584
Am I right in thinking your mother-in-law
is fond of you, Miss Garret?

620
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:16,084
She was the only one in that family
who ever treated me with kindness.

621
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:19,842
She came here many times, much
to the annoyance of her son.

622
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:22,259
Is it possible that on
one of those visits,

623
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:24,664
she could have taken
a spare set of keys?

624
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:28,398
Are you suggesting that it was my
mother-in-law who had it stolen from me?

625
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,819
We are, but with
a good intention.

626
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:33,338
I trust this is not
a tale of kindness.

627
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,069
A story of solidarity
and compassion

628
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:37,002
is rather a difficult sell.

629
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:39,009
Well, shall we just give
Miss Scarlet a moment

630
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:41,135
to explain, Mr Sinclair.

631
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,969
Mrs Dashwood's lawyer hired me using
the name of a bogus insurance company.

632
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,391
Swab and Dustin.

633
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:52,199
Mrs Dashwood had a fondness
for translation and word play.

634
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:55,711
The name Swab and
Dustin is an anagram

635
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:59,113
for 'Darwin's bust'.

636
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:33,259
My cup runneth over.

637
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:37,158
Mrs Dashwood hoped this story would
generate publicity for the museum

638
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:38,305
to bring in the crowds for you.

639
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:40,729
It's the story of a woman trying
to make it in a man's world,

640
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:46,555
a female detective
investigating her along the way,

641
00:37:47,009 --> 00:37:48,368
and a cunning trail

642
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,469
laid by a brilliant lady

643
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:53,011
who wasn't allowed to
be brilliant in life.

644
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,613
Your mother in law wanted
to help you, Miss Garret.

645
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,519
I do not know what to say.

646
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:03,954
You need find no
words, Miss Garret.

647
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:07,431
For Basil Sinclair
shall find them for you.

648
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:11,759
Thank you.

649
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:13,894
It's my pleasure.

650
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:21,549
When the story is published

651
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:23,355
Miss Garret will find
business booming.

652
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,730
They'll be queuing out the door.

653
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:26,634
Much to her husband's dismay.

654
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:32,275
William, I hate to admit
it, but you were right.

655
00:38:32,337 --> 00:38:35,275
It was only because I'm a
woman that I got the case.

656
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:36,739
So?

657
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:39,519
So I want to be hired for
being good at what I do,

658
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,170
not because I wear a bonnet.

659
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,771
Eliza, there is no escaping
that you are a woman,

660
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,201
just like there was no
escaping that I'm a man.

661
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:49,787
I'm also Scottish young enough
to say that I'm still only 30,

662
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:50,974
old enough to know better

663
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:53,632
and these are all things that I
use to my advantage when it suits.

664
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:55,974
How do you use being
Scottish to your advantage?

665
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:57,375
That's nothing like
a drunken Scott

666
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:00,352
to deceive an overconfident
idiot at the poker table.

667
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:05,524
What I'm trying to say is, use
what you have to your advantage

668
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:08,767
just like anyone else
does, man or woman.

669
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,431
It's no more complex than
that, so do not make it so.

670
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:15,589
Right, I must leave.

671
00:39:15,655 --> 00:39:17,693
I don't want to be
stuck with Mr Sinclair.

672
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:19,245
There is something in his manner

673
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:21,664
that gives me the
urge to punch him.

674
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,744
Inspector..

675
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,079
Might I trouble you for a
ride back to the office?

676
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,519
And on the way I can regale you

677
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,371
with my retelling of this
rather delicious story.

678
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:43,887
I spoke with your doctor.

679
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,129
He said you'll be fine.

680
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:51,018
You also said you were lucky.

681
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:53,987
Your heart rate was
dangerously erratic.

682
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:56,308
It could kill you
if it happens again.

683
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:59,706
I didn't tell him my suspicions
as to what may have caused it.

684
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:03,110
Collapsing in front of a
suspect was unforgivable, Sir.

685
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,379
I assume you're going to inform
Superintendent Munro of my behavior?

686
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:08,083
And why would I do that?

687
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:11,528
Anything that you do,
it's me who has to suffer,

688
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,917
it's me whose head
is on the block.

689
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,849
In his quest to make
something of his son,

690
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,914
my father has sought help in
a long line of institutions.

691
00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:23,639
His old boarding school and
then his beloved Sandhurst

692
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,493
and even a short
spell in the Navy.

693
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,760
How did they fare?

694
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:29,419
I was relentlessly bullied

695
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:32,299
and they only served to
cement my father's opinion

696
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:34,689
that I am an embarrassment
to our family.

697
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:41,078
And the police force is
unfortunately for me, his last hope.

698
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:45,880
It is a burden indeed to know
that your own father despises you.

699
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,583
And..

700
00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:50,607
The opium has gone some way,
providing me with some relief.

701
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:55,082
All I had growing up was a
daily beating in the workhouse.

702
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:58,574
We all have our scars, Fitzroy.

703
00:40:58,614 --> 00:41:00,334
If it's sympathy or
after, don't look to me.

704
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,996
Of all the men whose command
I have been under you.

705
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:05,415
You are the most decent
man of all of them

706
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:08,632
and that is why I will do whatever it
takes to make you proud of me, Sir.

707
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:14,541
So what do you suggest?

708
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:18,369
Put me on administration duty,
Sir, I'd be good at that.

709
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:21,697
I know I can be a
decent detective.

710
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:25,169
I just need some time
to learn the basics.

711
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,435
That's a decision then.

712
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:33,129
You come on time ready to work

713
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:33,909
and we'll take it from there.

714
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:36,575
Thank you Sir I will
not let you down.

715
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,962
There is one more
thing Detective.

716
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:41,157
Yes, Sir?

717
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:42,712
Get that bloody hair cut.

718
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:45,196
Consider it done, Sir.

719
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:55,087
Miss Scarlet.

720
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,103
Mrs Parker, what
a nice surprise.

721
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:04,138
Never have I been so humiliated
in front of my ladies.

722
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:06,232
What you did was unforgivable.

723
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,625
And I'm sorry for it.

724
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:09,657
My intention was not
to humiliate you.

725
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:12,935
And the accusations
you made - abhorrent!

726
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,271
Accusations based on truth.

727
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:19,013
I will use every
ounce of my influence

728
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:24,075
to destroy you and your little
private investigation business.

729
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,499
I will have my retribution
to my full satisfaction

730
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:30,501
and see you ruined,
Miss Scarlet.

731
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:35,880
These and other thoughts ran
through my head after you left.

732
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,519
So you do not think them now?

733
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:41,109
I did a little
research of my own.

734
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:44,057
It appears your
accusations were..

735
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:45,807
Correct.

736
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:47,682
So.

737
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:51,209
Given you have proven
your resourcefulness.

738
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:54,529
I wish to engage you
in another matter.

739
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:06,301
These are the gentlemen I have selected
as potential husbands for my niece.

740
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:08,709
As yet she has had
no offers of marriage

741
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,470
and is not getting any younger.

742
00:43:10,743 --> 00:43:15,361
In fact I believe she's the exact
same age as you Miss Scarlet.

743
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:19,529
So, I would like a complete
dossier on each candidate

744
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,579
and then I can make my choice
as to their suitability.

745
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:24,876
You wish to hire me?

746
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:26,844
Good day.

747
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:30,578
I'm confused Mrs Parker.

748
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,269
You declared my clients to be
either desperate or impoverished,

749
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:38,152
unable to pay the going rate,
yet you wish to be a client now.

750
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:41,724
I can assure you I am
neither of those things

751
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:44,498
and I am willing to
pay the full fee.

752
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:46,139
Why me?

753
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,803
Why not go to one of
my male counterparts?

754
00:43:49,203 --> 00:43:53,093
There is a very good reason I
came to you and no one else.

755
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,297
You are the only private
investigator I know

756
00:43:56,477 --> 00:43:59,156
and it is no more
complex than that.

757
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,121
Do you not make it so, Eliza?
