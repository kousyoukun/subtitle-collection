1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,200
All right.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
I want to get on.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:31,160
To Josh, Chris, Jeff,

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,920
right.

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,720
Oh, I don't know.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
I need to know.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,840
Not nothing like it.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,360
Well, you're always doing

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,120
this.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,480
You know, if I look

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,440
well, it's a

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,920
real meeting

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,400
today.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,600
Sort of problem.

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:27,120
So stick a c. No,

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,760
I know we've not always seen eye to eye,

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,000
but I try not to let personal feelings

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,640
get in the way of professional decisions.

19
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,120
Which is why I'm recommending you

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,480
for a promotion.

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,360
So a vacancy for Chief
Inspector has come up a good one for you.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,480
The job is yours.

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
Well, thank you very much, sir.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,040
You know, it's about time
you received the recognition you deserve.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,880
Well done, lady. Thank you.

26
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you, sir.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
Maybe a few more pennies in the bank.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,880
Do you need to talk that through
with Superintendent McNeill?

29
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,840
But Superintendent McNeill promotions the
Glasgow Force be leaving end of the month

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,240
in Glasgow.

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,720
Force.

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,440
Nice to get back to the old one, Tony.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
Well, then again, Lady.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,440
So I would like some time to think

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,520
about it.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,960
Well, I'm off to Manchester
for a couple of days.

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:03:19,920
Give me an answer when I get back.

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Mr. Victor LATTMAN. None.

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
Lord Alexander Lipton.

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,760
No, sir. Thomas Pembroke.

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,960
Marquess of Bath. Not nothing.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,800
Not a single piece of scandal
on any of them.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,320
Well, the uncle of the Lepton man
has been throwing his money around.

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, not to hospitals.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,840
And a fact treatment clause for the poor.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
They've been doing this for weeks now.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
Well, you hear what they've been up to.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Mrs. Parker pays me to do background
checks

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,720
on potential husbands for her niece.

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
She wants to know if they're suitable.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,680
And I promise, had he defined reasons
why they were unsuitable.

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,480
She wishes to marry someone of her own
choosing, and her aunt will.

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,160
Need to find someone else
to do the yard digging.

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm done.

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,720
I know it's unethical, but
how do you spend such a sheltered life?

56
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,800
I don't care.

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,840
What it takes is boring.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,160
Boring?

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,360
They're all seamen with the same families
and the same lives.

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,240
There are better uses of my time.

61
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,800
I have a reputation to protect.

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,880
Since you are asking for more money.

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,360
No. It'd be about professional pride. Why?

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
I'm much afraid.

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
You're right.

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,320
There are much better uses of our time.

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm doing as presently.

68
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,520
I tell her to speak to her aunt.

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm happy to have a word with Mrs.

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Parker myself. If the money is right.

71
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,920
Now, that is something
I would love to see.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:00,240
And Inspector.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,160
Moses.

74
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
What does he want?

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,160
Well, working the case isn't.

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,240
The kind of case.

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Tony Waistcoat.

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Very smart.

79
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,240
No. Are you aware
how often you change the subject

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,760
when you don't
wish to talk about something?

81
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm glad you had a favor to ask.

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,320
When do you plans?

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,920
On this evening.

84
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,160
I was in System's departure
as Barnabas comes to.

85
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
There's no way
I can settle that in the home.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,600
Eliza, he's his own anyway.

87
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,120
Never mind that I am.

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,520
I need to speak to you about something.

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
Do you mind if I have a card when we talk?

90
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,720
Kathy Park is calling around
and I'm running late.

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Yes, fine.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,920
So, um.

93
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,960
So I was at work this morning.

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,720
This isn't going to be about Moses, is it?

95
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,920
No, he's all about Moses.

96
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,600
If you insist on such things. No criminal.
This is about Moses.

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,320
I didn't come here to speak to you
about Moses.

98
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,840
All born with bloody pox.

99
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,680
I've.

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
I've been offered a promotion.

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,920
Chief Inspector William

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,240
for news.

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,440
Congratulations.

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,600
The job's in Glasgow.

105
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, I see.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,880
That's a shame.

107
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,200
I don't mind.

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,760
Is that what you're going to say?

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,520
What else is there to say?

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,880
Was in Glasgow.

111
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,320
Allies of.

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,880
Scotland. I'm well aware where Glasgow is.

113
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,440
You're not going to take it. So.

114
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,240
How do you know
William? I say this is a friend.

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Since I've known you.

116
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,320
You've been offered many different jobs.

117
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
Any that are outside of London.

118
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
We've always turned. Out. Yes.

119
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,640
And this is a promotion
to Chief Inspector.

120
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,880
As for the job in Nottingham,
I seem to remember

121
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,600
we've had this conversation
on at least three occasions.

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,080
And each time
you agonize over the decision

123
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,880
and in the end decide to stay.

124
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
My not comfortable here.

125
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,760
Comfortable.
It was a poor choice of words.

126
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,600
For your information, I'm
seriously thinking about taking this job.

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,520
And yes, I'm
well aware that I've said that before.

128
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,160
William has

129
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,640
come.

130
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Through and has given me yet
another list of potential husbands.

131
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm running out of reasons
whether I'm suitable.

132
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,560
You must speak to her to tell her
you do wish to marry.

133
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,680
It is not that I do not wish to marry.

134
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,840
It's just I do not wish to marry
someone who does not wish to marry me.

135
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,480
They want to marry for love. Yes,

136
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
but my aunt thinks I'm fanciful.

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,840
Harriet, she says
you do not have the luxury of time.

138
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,640
Oh. Looks to wait for love.

139
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,680
How could she possibly understand?

140
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,880
Everyone is in love with her.

141
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,680
You're a grown woman.

142
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,560
You must stand up for yourself as you try
that.

143
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
You'd be surprised
how determined she can be.

144
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,920
As here

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
you are a lovely young woman.

146
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,880
Any man would be lucky
to have you as that wife.

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,840
Sir. Absolutely.

148
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
I will tell my aunt I do not wish to wed.

149
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,720
And that is that

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,440
Papa left me some money.

151
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,480
Perhaps I could set up my own house.

152
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,320
There may be financial implications,
but as you say, Eliza,

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm a grown woman and I will find a way.

154
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,840
Do you will?

155
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,360
I will go and see Mr. Norris,
our family accountant.

156
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,520
He will tell me which pass strings
my aunt controls.

157
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,360
So that is a plan.

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,040
Is it?

159
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,560
It is. Will you come with me?

160
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,560
I have every faith
that you can do this on your own.

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,000
So that is a definite no? Yes.

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,000
And you will not change your mind? No.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,280
Thank you for changing your mind.

164
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,800
Must be careful what to say to Mr. Norris.

165
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,440
He's rather enamored with my aunt, right?

166
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,760
Oh, yes. She has many admirers.

167
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,400
She's a very handsome woman.

168
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:59,840
It's a mystery how she remains alone.

169
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,440
Mr. Norris.

170
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,520
Oh, I hear. You.

171
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,040
He didn't want to come in.

172
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,320
Mr. Norris.

173
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,800
Mr. Norris.

174
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
It's Miss Parker. Mr. Norris.

175
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,640
Norris.

176
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,680
That's the police.

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
No. Hattie.

178
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
We must begin about 2 hours

179
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,560
after Dash first and the muscles around
the face and jaw and then it outwards

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,560
to the rest of the body.

181
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,400
So it feels very familiar.

182
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,920
Prescott I still remember asking you
to accompany Mrs.

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,160
Parker
back to Scotland Yard to give a statement.

184
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,840
So many of us staged.

185
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Why go to all that effort?

186
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,080
Try moving his wrists

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,960
completely rigid.

188
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,520
Full rigor mortis takes 14 to 18 hours

189
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,680
to develop, which puts the time of death
at some point last night.

190
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,760
A rough guide?

191
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,040
Of course we can't.
The exact time. For the. Midnight.

192
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,000
I stand corrected.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,160
Ms.. Scholars clearly developed a new
technique unknown to medical science.

194
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,080
It's called Using Your Eyes.

195
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,480
The clock has been stopped.

196
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,000
No, it has stopped.

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,320
You do not know. Has been stopped.

198
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
Inspector Wellington.

199
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
This entire scene
is exactly as it was in the novel.

200
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,760
What novel?

201
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
What does? A Midnight by Samuel Barber.

202
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
You heard about it? No.

203
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,360
Enlighten me.

204
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,560
For a few years since I read it,

205
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,160
I would swear everything in this room
is precisely as it was in the book.

206
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,800
The Bloodstained Alley.

207
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,520
The knife in the neck.

208
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,280
The arrangement of his hand on the chest.

209
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,960
And the clock stopped at midnight.

210
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
You really should read while I replant.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
It is not a particular book.

212
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,840
I've not read it either.

213
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
Thank you, Detective Fitzroy.

214
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,400
Although I do read
at least one book a week.

215
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,600
At the moment I'm working
through the Russian study with Goncharov.

216
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,960
Make yourself useful.

217
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,960
See if there's a visitor's book
or a list of his appointments.

218
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,800
I know who was last in here.

219
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,640
Miss Scarlet Ford.

220
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,560
Go back to Scotland Yard.

221
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
Make a statement.

222
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,360
Then I can be much more. You said.

223
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
You just do what I ask.

224
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,000
This is about your job, isn't it?

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,400
You're annoyed with what I said.

226
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,680
And I am so often
annoyed with what you've said.

227
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,360
It's hard to keep track.

228
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,960
When I said you were comfortable.

229
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,400
You meant I lacked ambition.

230
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,960
No, of course. Not

231
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,160
only that, your life is arranged
as you like it.

232
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,280
You're settled.

233
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
That sounds even more insulting
than comfortable.

234
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,640
I think it's best
if we cease to discuss this.

235
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,120
I will let you know my decision
when I have come to it.

236
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,840
All right. Can I just say no?

237
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,800
I go back to Scotland Yard

238
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,960
and ask for Phelps.

239
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,920
That book.

240
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
The one you think the murderer imitated.

241
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,440
You said it was from by Samuel Bedford.

242
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
That's right. Why?

243
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,040
The victim was his accountant.

244
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I do not see what the bulk of it.

245
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm not hiring you. Just hear me out.

246
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Firstly, I've heard every time I've been
able, I'm a huge fan of his work.

247
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,880
Secondly,

248
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,680
if you don't hire me, how do you like me?

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,640
Mr. Norris was a friend of Iran's.

250
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,760
Surely it's better to share information
and resources.

251
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,840
You know, for me, the taxpayers of London.

252
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,720
Oh, you're so selfless, Eliza.

253
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,800
As a person, I must bear.

254
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,760
So is that a yes?

255
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,560
How much is your free?

256
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,760
On second thoughts,
let's forgive the haggling and think that

257
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,200
the first moment you were going to say.

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,800
That seems fair.

259
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,480
Good.

260
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,960
Half it.

261
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,200
He could not be distracted

262
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
once his mind was focused on a task.

263
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
There was nothing that could break

264
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,520
his chain of thought,
not the shattering of the window

265
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,080
downstairs,
not the footsteps in the hallway.

266
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,360
When at last he looked up,

267
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,760
he saw a blade glistening in the moonlight

268
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,640
and felt the cold steel pierce

269
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,640
his heart.

270
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Thus concludes

271
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,040
Chapter three.

272
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,800
Thank you, Mr.

273
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Bedford, for once again
gracing our humble.

274
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Shop with such a wonderful. Reading.

275
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,080
Now, if you would like to form
an orderly queue, Mr.

276
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,360
Bedford will gladly sign
copies of his book

277
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,680
as long as they have been purchased here.

278
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:47,240
Of course. I.

279
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,760
No, no, no.

280
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,840
Outside, please.

281
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
I need to speak to Mr. Baird, bro.

282
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,680
This event is for ticket holders only.

283
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm in search of Wellington, Scotland
Yard.

284
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
I'm here on piece business.
And yet you brought your wife.

285
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,040
She's not my wife.

286
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm a

287
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,640
private detective assisting Scotland Yard
with their inquiries.

288
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,600
I've heard many excuses in my time,
but that.

289
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,640
I, for God's sake,
haven't even read any of his done books.

290
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
I have.

291
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,720
I am Mr.

292
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,360
Federer, Samuel's sister.

293
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,440
Is something wrong?

294
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,280
I need to speak to your brother
right away. Yes.

295
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
When did this happen?

296
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
We believe Mr.
Norris was killed last night.

297
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,520
Can you think of anyone
who might wish to do harm?

298
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,720
They always seem to be
a perfectly decent man.

299
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,400
In truth, I didn't know.

300
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, he was a business acquaintance.

301
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,120
We only met a few times a year.

302
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,360
When was the last time?

303
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,160
A few weeks ago.

304
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,920
I couldn't say for sure.

305
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,920
As we mentioned,
we believe the crime scene was arranged

306
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,000
to resemble the murders
in quarter to midnight extra.

307
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,400
You understand that.

308
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,120
I have to ask you about your own movements
last night, sir. Why?

309
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
It's a standard question, Samuel.

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,080
I ask it of everyone.

311
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,960
I have a sweet Brabham hotel.

312
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm staying there
whilst I finish my latest novel.

313
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,200
And were you alone?

314
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,640
You mean apart from the 50 staff
and 300 guests.

315
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,160
Samuel.

316
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,440
My sister and I had dinner
and then I wrote all night.

317
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm rather late delivering
my latest novel.

318
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,880
Is it true you once finished a manuscript
in the carriage

319
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,960
on the way to the publishers?

320
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,920
I woeful about deadlines,
but I have no need for Muse or Mood.

321
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,520
I can write any time or any place
you enjoy my novels?

322
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,160
Very much so, yes.

323
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
In fact, quarter to midnight
is my favorite.

324
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,880
Oh, I haven't read that
particular one, but

325
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,280
I did enjoy Curse of the Crimson Shadow.

326
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,760
That was not me.

327
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,160
Could do midnight.

328
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,920
It's based on his own life.

329
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,960
He spent years as an unpublished writer
before finally enjoying success.

330
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,080
Writer in the novel was

331
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,720
under pressure to deliver his latest book
and slowly starts going insane.

332
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,400
Believes his two best friends
want to put him in an asylum

333
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,600
so he kills them both.

334
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,760
But like Macbeth,
he is unable to live with the guilt.

335
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
You do know the story of.

336
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,240
Yes, Eliza, I know the story of Macbeth.

337
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
My apologies.

338
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,560
Anyway,

339
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,760
when the author in the novel was a child,
his parents died of scarlet fever.

340
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,640
As a boy, he witnessed them
laid out in their coffins at home,

341
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,920
each holding a lily.

342
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,960
The clock in his office
about a quarter to midnight,

343
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,520
which is the exact time of two murders
in the book take place,

344
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,800
but on separate nights.

345
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,400
So if someone is not keen to replicate the
book in his post, they could kill again.

346
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,360
It's possible. Yes.

347
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,760
Do we know any more about our victim?

348
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,800
Edward Norris, 52 years old, sir.

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,400
Fond memories to respect for the countless
hundred or so clients

350
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,240
that we're busy tracking down.

351
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
I'm going to read the book again.

352
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,120
See if there's anything we've missed.

353
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,080
May I suggest you do the same?

354
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,360
Fitzroy?

355
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,960
Everything you have so far. And Norris
and his associates.

356
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,960
Right away, sir.

357
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,600
Oh, and give me a brief synopsis
on the story of Macbeth.

358
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,640
A couple of pages to
you will have it, sir.

359
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,280
When the hurly burly is done,
when the battle's lost.

360
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,720
And one may not one pitch.

361
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,560
Yes, sir.

362
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,480
One. This is Mr.

363
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,000
Bedford's most famous work.

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
But have you considered
beginning with a loan in Greenwich,

365
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,400
which should be here somewhere?

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,680
Yes. I'll read that straight after this.

367
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,560
Miss Willoughby.

368
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,960
Might I recommend that you read it first?

369
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,560
They do make a wonderful pair.

370
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,720
Such vivid prose.

371
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,400
I could recite every line.

372
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,160
I think I'll just start with this one
for Nice.

373
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,320
You know, what am I saying?

374
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,760
I would also recommend the jagged tears

375
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,800
effect.

376
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,280
But perhaps I should just get you
his complete works.

377
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,000
How does that sound? Expensive.

378
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,040
May I ask why you wanted to speak to Mr.

379
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,120
Bedford? I can discuss something for it.

380
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,280
I knew there was something wrong
as soon as he came in.

381
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,840
He usually turns up to readings
in a wonderful mood.

382
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,240
But today he was

383
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,840
rather withdrawn and upset.

384
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,640
And this was before I spoke to him. Yes.

385
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
I've never seen him like that before.

386
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,840
I do hope everything is all right.

387
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,320
Would you like in wrapped.

388
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,800
From one.

389
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,960
Of us, skipper.

390
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,040
To concentrate?

391
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,800
I could.

392
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,240
Get. You in

393
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,760
any way.

394
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,840
You felt like you.

395
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,920
As for the Norris case, I.

396
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,560
Did not view down as much of a reader,

397
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,320
but from the sporting past.

398
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,880
You want something, Charlie?

399
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,400
No. Just say now you are.

400
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,040
If there's any news.

401
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,480
In the ten years

402
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,680
we've worked together, I don't think
you've ever bought me a drink.

403
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,600
People change. People do.

404
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,680
You don't like it?

405
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,640
What do you want?

406
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,200
I got sober
talking to you about a promotion.

407
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,640
I was just passing.

408
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,840
Passing. And I was thinking

409
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,280
if you did take it,
you might put in a word for me

410
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
to take over from you.

411
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
You're not such a sinner.

412
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,160
What was your strong point was it?

413
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,720
I've got a wife and four kids.

414
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,440
Five kids?

415
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Your car full to be sorted.

416
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,120
I know you've had offers in the past
and it back.

417
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,280
But you're not getting any younger
naval officer.

418
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,040
At some point the offers are not coming
and that will be your law.

419
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,160
If you were happy with our.

420
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,800
Things are fine. But if you're not. Yes.

421
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:22,400
Thank you, Detective.

422
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,760
He could.

423
00:20:23,760 --> 00:21:02,240
Terrible.

424
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,920
Good morning.

425
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,240
Morning.

426
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,320
Did you submit.

427
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,440
Make some progress to the Norris case
and to the evidence?

428
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,280
How did you find me?

429
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,240
Oh, no.

430
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,120
Lucky guess.

431
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,880
You do have something of a set routine.

432
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,080
Beethoven on Monday.

433
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,920
Double track on Tuesday.

434
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,560
Shoes on a Wednesday.

435
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,480
Thursday.

436
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,120
Oh, you've made your point.

437
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,360
Progress has been made.

438
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,840
I need to see the murder weapon.

439
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
I read that, of course, midnight.

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,280
On Saturday,
along with some of his other work.

441
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,680
There's no reason to out.

442
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,040
Yes. Themes rags to riches are very common
with characters.

443
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,240
Like the lawyer and the London Greenwich.

444
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
Man. Not by surprise, unimpressed.

445
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,640
Compliment and sullen one.

446
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,120
That's quite something.
Even for your lighter.

447
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,160
Have you made
your decision is about the job.

448
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,840
As I said, I'll let you know when I have.

449
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,280
Well,
please feel free to discuss it with me.

450
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,880
And let you suffer here.

451
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,800
Thank you.

452
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,440
My intention was not to insult.

453
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,000
Can be rather sensitive
sometimes sensitive.

454
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,160
Unsettle others.
Just because, Bertram, that's. Not.

455
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,640
The case.

456
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,200
Eliza wants to see the murder weapon,
the cat.

457
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,960
And at midnight, it's the same weapon
which made the knife. Yes.

458
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,720
First victim was stabbed in the neck
with our knife.

459
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,200
The second had the same knife
embedded in his neck.

460
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,120
Just how we found Norris.

461
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,760
Which means he may not
be the first victim.

462
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,960
Exactly.

463
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,040
You wrote.

464
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,560
I closed the book last night,
and I just must find publishers

465
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,960
not on the crest.

466
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,320
He's like anything else.

467
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,800
So the killer is following
the plot of the book.

468
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:07,640
Then the knife belongs
to the first victim.

469
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
It's not.

470
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
Mr. Bellamy.

471
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,600
Is there a side entrance?

472
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,520
There's no time for that.

473
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,640
Kick it down

474
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,680
because touching touched

475
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:26,840
nothing.

476
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,960
Let's get to Wellington.

477
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,440
And here.

478
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:48,320
Just like the novel.

479
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,800
Right down to the time.

480
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,080
James was a good man.

481
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,600
He'd been my publisher for years.

482
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,800
When did you last see him?

483
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,400
At dinner on Thursday night.

484
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,560
How did he seem?

485
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,640
In good spirits.

486
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
And you can think of
no one that may wish to do him harm.

487
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,840
I don't know.

488
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,120
My mind is a little foggy.

489
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,480
My brother has been up all night writing.

490
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,400
I tell him to go to bed,
but he never listens.

491
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,360
And that's where you were last night?

492
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,800
In this room, writing?

493
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,400
Yes, all night.

494
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,680
May I ask what happened to your hand?

495
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,080
God sake!

496
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,960
Must you
keep asking these relevant questions?

497
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,080
Samuel? I

498
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,000
slipped in the vault.

499
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,160
Could we finish this later?

500
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,240
I must go and visit James's son.

501
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,040
We prefer you stay here, sir.

502
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,520
Both murders were exactly
as in your novel.

503
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,120
And as you know, there is a third death.

504
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,200
All through my novel takes his own life.

505
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,680
I can assure you
I'm not planning on doing that.

506
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,840
Even so, if someone is determined
to replicate the book, they may wish to do

507
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,880
you harm. Your sister's right,
Mr. Barbara.

508
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,240
I'll arrange police protection for you
in the meantime, if you'd like to go home.

509
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,920
Our homes are being decorated.

510
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,720
I'll stay here. As you wish.

511
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,160
I'll wait here
until an officer arrives with Scarlet.

512
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:24,120
If you could take this message back
to Scotland Yard for me.

513
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,080
I tracked down the nightfall
to some of it,

514
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,480
but left the hotel last night around
9:00 and didn't return again to dawn.

515
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,480
Midnight.

516
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,760
A killer
who replicates the plot of his own book.

517
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,040
Isn't it more likely
someone's trying to damage his reputation?

518
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,920
Possibly.

519
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,520
There's no book cover than a murderer
who hates in plain sight.

520
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,520
It's like he

521
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,800
was arrested three months ago
for public disorder.

522
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,800
He was arguing with a woman in the street,
and apparently

523
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,000
they threatened to kill each other.

524
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,760
They were arrested for breach
of the peace, but no charges were brought.

525
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,360
So they were cautioned and released.

526
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,560
And Jessica Sweeney.

527
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,080
Is an actress.

528
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,320
Go and speak to them.

529
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,240
I the bodies, the mortuary.

530
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,400
Mr. Covered.

531
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,960
Excuse me, sir. Your carriage is ready.

532
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,160
Thank you, Fitzroy.

533
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,040
On the way back from the mortuary,
I wonder if we might go via Covent Garden.

534
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,280
I very much like to see tickets
for the premiere of Offenbach's

535
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,440
The Tales of Hoffmann.

536
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,640
Perhaps I would do that my own time.

537
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,360
Perhaps you will.

538
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,840
What'll happen to him if I leave?

539
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,120
Well, it's a good job
that you're not going to take the job.

540
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,560
How many times?

541
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,880
I haven't made my decision yet.

542
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,400
Unlike you, I give consideration
to the life that I've built here.

543
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,040
What do you mean?

544
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,280
Unlike me?

545
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,120
Well, if you were offered
the job, you'd think in a heartbeat.

546
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,600
Well, on the day
that women are allowed to be

547
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
chief inspectors,
we should have that conversation.

548
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,560
You know what I mean?

549
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,400
If you were offered more money
and high profile cases,

550
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
you would jump at the chance.

551
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,640
We're the location.
We're very different people, William.

552
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,160
Oh, meaning
that you have a singular ambition.

553
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,520
And I am a dull and predictable,
beautiful.

554
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,560
Monday shoeshine in a way to school.

555
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,240
Am I?

556
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
You do not have to
justify your life to me.

557
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,440
I do.

558
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,040
And you constantly tease me about her.

559
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,760
And I apologize.

560
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,880
Clearly, it's a nerve from.
Where I have come from.

561
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,680
I have done done well to get this far.

562
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,120
We don't all have the luxury
of inheriting a father's business.

563
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,480
I was going to speak to Ms..

564
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
Pelosi and I'll have her reporting.

565
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Morning. Eliza.

566
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,600
Eliza, I apologize that

567
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,760
that came out harsher than I expected.

568
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Don't let me keep you waiting.

569
00:27:37,760 --> 00:28:04,160
It's almost time for your 3:00 whiskey,
Sidney.

570
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:13,320
I'm looking for Miss Fettuccini.

571
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,800
What was the nature of your relationship
with Mr.

572
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,640
Bhadra?

573
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,400
The nature of our relationship?

574
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,520
Yes. Physical. And.

575
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,040
And where did you meet him?

576
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,560
Some party cannot remember whose.

577
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,120
But we do not see each other anymore.

578
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,600
I have a new level.

579
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,880
Younger, much more willing to please.

580
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,000
You know

581
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,520
what happened the night you were arrested?

582
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,440
I had little too much to drink
and went to see him.

583
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,640
And one thing led to another.

584
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,760
You know how these things go.

585
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,600
The police were understanding.

586
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,040
I told them it was Italian person,
not that them from Italy.

587
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,560
Nobody has heard about my country. So.

588
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,680
Italy plays much better.

589
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,320
So you argue
because he finished your relationship.

590
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,280
He sends his little friend
with a diamond necklace.

591
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,720
A parting gift to make me go quietly.

592
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,920
Who is this friend? Norris?

593
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,760
His accountant, I think.

594
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,480
I call him the Grim Reaper.

595
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,160
When you see him, you know it's over.

596
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,520
Cause of death is identical in both cases.

597
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,040
A single puncture
wound to the carotid artery.

598
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,080
The size of the wound indicates
the same weapon.

599
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You to start
making those close encounters.

600
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,760
ST See if he had any visitors.

601
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,160
Fitzroy Phelps
You do the same for the publisher.

602
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Screw your courage to the sticking place
will not fail.

603
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
Lady Macbeth.

604
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,000
I have to go with him.

605
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,480
That depends
whether you want to keep your job.

606
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:45,800
All right.

607
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,520
Off you go.

608
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,920
Fitzroy

609
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,440
word, please.

610
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,040
What we do requires
working as part of a team.

611
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,520
Any detective, above all, needs the trust
and respect of his colleagues,

612
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,800
including Shakespeare.

613
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,520
Sorry, sir.

614
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,680
It was misjudged.

615
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,440
One day
I may not be around and coat for you.

616
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,040
So you need stuffing in. Where you going?

617
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm just making the point

618
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,840
with them.

619
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,280
Why let them moan about their job
or their wives or the money

620
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,040
that they lost in the narcs?

621
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,000
Let them moan about me.

622
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,280
I would never let them do that.

623
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,240
The more you are an outsider, the weaker
you will be.

624
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
And when they felt they could smell
weakness, no, that doesn't make him a bad

625
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,160
man. It's
just the nature of being a copper.

626
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,600
Tony can be one of the lads.

627
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,760
You sound like my father.

628
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,520
God forbid.

629
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,880
Sorry for the delay.

630
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,920
I was comforting my aunt.

631
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,520
She's in great distress about Mr. Norris.

632
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,000
Well, I have a question about Mr.

633
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,040
Norris.

634
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,280
Samuel Barber said that he and Norris

635
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,240
had a purely professional relationship,
only seeing each other a few times a year.

636
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,400
Really?

637
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,000
I found that strange.

638
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,920
Mr. Norris is always mentioning Mr.

639
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,080
Barber to my aunt.

640
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,640
He made out to respect things
that may not have been true, of course.

641
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,120
He may have been trying to impress
since he was secretly in love with her.

642
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,600
Here we go. 5 minutes
without mentioning your aunt.

643
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Yes, of course. My apologies.

644
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,640
You said Norris and everyone take a seat.

645
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,680
It is my understanding that
they don't get it several times a month.

646
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,560
I missed her.

647
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,800
Norris was always doing this favor
or that for Mr.

648
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,680
Barbara.

649
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,480
I believe that Mr.

650
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,920
Norris recently arranged the purchase
of the house in Knightsbridge.

651
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,000
It was only a few doors down from

652
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,240
I'm about to mention
my aunt, but I believe it is relevant.

653
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,440
Go on.

654
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,280
Mr. Pappas, new house
is on the same street as my aunt's.

655
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,280
The other residents were beside themselves
to have such a well-known

656
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
face living among them. Until.

657
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,600
Well,

658
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,840
I am not one to gossip, of course.

659
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,840
But please do.

660
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,480
Mr. Barbara moved in not two months ago.

661
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,080
I seem to be spending a fortune
on my relations.

662
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:22,640
But then last week,
the strangest thing happened.

663
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,640
Some rude bedbug is up to his neck
in debt.

664
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,280
He's staying a suite at the bathroom.

665
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,840
Not for much longer.

666
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,360
He's facing a hefty bill.

667
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,520
It was money all over town.

668
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,040
That's why the natives took his house
and everything in it.

669
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,280
You had to build this last night.

670
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,400
Doing what?

671
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,400
Trying to get back some piece of furniture
they took from him every day this week.

672
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,080
He's turned up trying to buy it back, but

673
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,320
they want to put it, believe it or not.

674
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,720
Piece of furniture.

675
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,560
Right in this.

676
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,840
I told them it couldn't write it out.

677
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,000
I just told me he had no need
for news on news.

678
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,760
Do right.

679
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,200
Any time any works.

680
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,720
With you on starting this clock?

681
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,840
Security caught him
breaking into the warehouse

682
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,080
last night, roughed him up on.

683
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,840
Spanish hand, as well as

684
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,240
he got contacts in.

685
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,600
I have contacts everywhere.

686
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,000
He got walking out the door.

687
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,280
And seen nothing like that. Before.

688
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,760
It was amazing.

689
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,040
Good evening.

690
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
It's actually Fitzroy.

691
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
Any possible bets on?

692
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,720
Very good.

693
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,920
Would anyone like a drink?

694
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,200
Oh, they don't serve milk in our.

695
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,880
I'll take that as a no. Oh.

696
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,280
Why don't you go with your mommy, Fitzroy,
so she can clean

697
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,000
you up?

698
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,600
What are you.

699
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,440
Shut your mouth, Phelps.

700
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,840
You want to repeat that?

701
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,040
I didn't think so.

702
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,520
Spoiled brat.

703
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:35,880
I don't want.

704
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,520
You shouldn't have done that, boy.

705
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,360
We've got 10 minutes to this exchange.

706
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,080
But first things.

707
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,440
All that dear.

708
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,840
It took everything from his house.

709
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,760
Didn't do it, Mr. Trick blows wise.

710
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
No wonder he's dead.

711
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Manners, expensive things.

712
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,240
These are for members of Piccadilly.

713
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,760
Here.

714
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Doesn't look like much. It's not.

715
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,520
It must be very attached to it. These are.

716
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,600
Give it back.

717
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,600
Maybe sentimental.

718
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,560
Poker tees.

719
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,240
What?

720
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,040
It one of peppers early novels.

721
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,640
There's a lawyer. Socrates.

722
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,720
The Greek God of silence.

723
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,080
Agent.

724
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,960
How is it that whatever secrets he knows.

725
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,600
Never speak of them.

726
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,720
I'll take them to the grave.

727
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:50,240
Of course, as secrets are discovered,
learning remains,

728
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,320
which is cool.

729
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,960
Piece of
peppers novels covered in that new work.

730
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,640
And they must be the original manuscripts.

731
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,080
Why keep them.

732
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,600
Hidden

733
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,120
and sent to report?

734
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,080
No, sir.

735
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,760
As Barbara is writing.

736
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,480
And that's not to be disturbed.

737
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,240
What is it.

738
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,880
Hell's going on?

739
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,360
My thoughts. Exactly.

740
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,280
I needed to confirm a suspicion.

741
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,120
There's no time to wait any longer.

742
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,280
Well, the final death in the book
is when the author takes his own life.

743
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,840
He must live among all.

744
00:36:48,840 --> 00:37:24,400
He's not the author. Mr.

745
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,720
for the Knife.

746
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,680
Don't do what he says.

747
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,160
Please. For

748
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,840
the writing desk
that was taken from your brother's home.

749
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,360
That was yours? Yes.

750
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,520
I found manuscripts inside with notes
from the publisher addressed to you.

751
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
So it was you who wrote the novels?

752
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,960
Not your brother.

753
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,360
Mother died in the workhouse. A father.

754
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,880
God knows what he went

755
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,880
to. I was determined
to make something of himself,

756
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,960
but he struggled for years
to become a novelist,

757
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,200
didn't have the heart to tell the truth,

758
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,640
but he lacked the talent he knew to.

759
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,560
Deep down,

760
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,760
and he's my older brother,
I would have done anything to help him.

761
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
So I did.

762
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,480
I rewrote his story.

763
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,400
I had a flair for it.

764
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,040
By the time I submitted his manuscript

765
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,080
publishers,
there was barely a word of his left.

766
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,880
Why do you put your own name on the cover?

767
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,680
Samuel begged me not to. You?

768
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,320
He cannot have suffered the humiliation.

769
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,520
The spinster sister was the one
putting food on the table and not him.

770
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,960
But after the success of the book
started to rise,

771
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,640
I did ask him
if I could put my name to the next.

772
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,680
That was when
they called the meeting. They

773
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,320
Samuel Bellamy and Norris.

774
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,320
The three of them convinced me

775
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,680
that as a woman,
my wage would be half of that as a man.

776
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,960
They promised that one day
I could write under my own name, but

777
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,680
that was not the right time.

778
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,960
It was never the right time.

779
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,720
Why kill them?

780
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,280
The one benefit
I received from this arrangement

781
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,280
was that I would be well looked after.

782
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,680
I would have a comfortable home security.

783
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,080
But then one day

784
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,240
the bailiffs arrived
and I found out the truth.

785
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,440
Some of those debts were all consuming.

786
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,560
He'd spent every penny of my money.

787
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,360
I'm going to be a nurse,
knew all along, did nothing.

788
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,320
They didn't care.

789
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,680
As long as Oakley's still being written
and they were receiving their money.

790
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,520
Money I was earning for them.
So this was your revenge.

791
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,400
And the world
would know that you were the true author.

792
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,640
I would have my moment of fame and death.

793
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,440
All this time

794
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,520
I brought the shine

795
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,160
for what? For?

796
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,480
To end up a poor spinster

797
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:18,000
back in a workhouse.

798
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,480
Would you like me to arrange a lift home?

799
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,520
Oh, thank you.

800
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,240
I would sit in myself,
but there are folks that have to finish

801
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,960
for the morning shift.

802
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,280
And send.

803
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,800
All this.

804
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,920
I was polite. This is exhausting.

805
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,200
Isn't it?

806
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,640
Just.

807
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,280
I didn't mean what I said
about your father's business.

808
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,040
I know you haven't been handed
anything to play.

809
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,320
I know how hard you've worked.

810
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,760
But there are times
when you push me too far.

811
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,160
I and it's easy because I'm so comfortable
in our friendship.

812
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,480
I suppose I can be a
little insensitive sometimes.

813
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,520
It's only because I'm envious.

814
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,840
Envious of me.

815
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,400
Not fulfilled in your life.

816
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,760
That's not lack of ambition.

817
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,120
That's something you should celebrate.

818
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,120
You have that rare thing
that most of us don't find in a lifetime.

819
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,920
True contentment.

820
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,280
That's why you're one of the people
I respect most.

821
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,000
When you say one of

822
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
Give me saw,
I didn't know you were still here.

823
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,320
What have you done now?

824
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,360
I did as you suggest.

825
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,480
I went for a drink and I tried to fit in.

826
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,360
Perhaps I tried a little too hard.

827
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,760
I could not go home to my father
like this. So

828
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,480
I thought I could sleep here.

829
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,320
I have a spare room.

830
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,240
You can stay there.

831
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:21,120
Thank you, sir.

832
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,280
Are you.

833
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,560
Going to.

834
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,920
Judge her?

835
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,480
I shouldn't

836
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,160
fight.

837
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,040
I can't let you

838
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,200
come off.

839
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,600
Quick words, sir.

840
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:16,640
I can see I'm almost done.

841
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,560
How was your trip, sir?

842
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,600
To ask

843
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,200
business or pleasure? Neither.

844
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,040
It was two days.

845
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,320
My wife's family.

846
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,480
So it was time to think.

847
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,200
I trust you realize
they get an opportunity.

848
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,560
This promotion is a have.

849
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,160
And you're right. It's a good opportunity.

850
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,440
But it's not one that's right for me.

851
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,560
I'm so.

852
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,680
I put in a lot of favors
to get you the slutty

853
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,000
chance like this may not come up again.

854
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,360
I won't understand, sir,
but my decision has made

855
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,360
my life here in London.

856
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,040
Well, I hope you would accept the position
so I could avoid this.

857
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,240
So, Fitzroy's

858
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,480
Father,
the police commissioner wants you gone.

859
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,120
Boy's getting worse, not better.

860
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,640
I been trying. He the albatross.

861
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,120
Which is why I told
you to put some distance between yourself

862
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,240
and him till I am sink or swim.

863
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,360
He wouldn't listen to me
at least drowning.

864
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,040
His father wants someone to blame.

865
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,560
So let me be crystal clear.

866
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,440
You're going to take this post in Glasgow.

867
00:44:36,440 --> 00:45:21,680
It's no longer a job for you here.
