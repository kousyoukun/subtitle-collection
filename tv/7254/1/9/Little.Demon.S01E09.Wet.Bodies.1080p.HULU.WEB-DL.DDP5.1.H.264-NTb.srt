1
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,366
The steak was dry, but
that bellboy was looking moist.

2
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,804
Yeah, I never knew
12-packs were a real thing.

3
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,209
Ay, Chihuahua.

4
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:23,781
Wow, we really needed
this vacay, huh?

5
00:00:23,848 --> 00:00:27,254
Ah, yeah, I just still feel
really bad about our fight.

6
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:29,560
Hey, what did we say?
Not going to talk about it.

7
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,462
Ah, Feinberg women
forgive and forget.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,435
Definitely the forget part.

9
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,015
Oh, fuck!

10
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,251
Tsunami!

11
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,088
We got to move!

12
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,296
Hold on, Chrissy.

13
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,467
- Chrissy, no!
- You did this.

14
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:52,471
- What?
- This is your fault, Mom.

15
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:53,908
Chrissy, no.

16
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:55,077
I knew you would turn on me

17
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,914
and leave me drowning
in a tsunami.

18
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,551
No!

19
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:05,932
Daddy to the rescue!

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,971
- Chrissy!
- Thanks, Dad. You're the best.

21
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:11,610
Mom, you suck!

22
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:12,545
Chrissy!

23
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:14,783
Chrissy. Chrissy.

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,019
No!

25
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,956
Ah!

26
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:21,296
Subconscious, you little bitch.

27
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,266
I'm getting Chrissy back.

28
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:33,420
<i>Laur? What the...
Oh, no.</i>

29
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:35,558
<i>Did the carbon monoxide
detector go off?</i>

30
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,729
<i>Been meaning to take the
batteries out of that thing.</i>

31
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:41,002
Uh, I made a huge mistake.
Chrissy can't stay with Satan.

32
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,806
There a chicken farm
around here?

33
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,277
<i>Uh-uh. Laura, you cannot
go get Chrissy.</i>

34
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:47,381
<i>24 hours ago, you tried
to murder each other.</i>

35
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:49,553
Okay, okay.
Then I'll just call her.

36
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,057
<i>No! I gave you
the keys to my beach house</i>

37
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:53,628
<i>so you could have some peace...</i>

38
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:55,565
<i>Lay on the beach,
sun your taint, you know?</i>

39
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,535
<i>Get your ass up to the sun.</i>

40
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:59,606
<i>There's no better feeling
in the whole world.</i>

41
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:01,409
<i>Chrissy said she needed space.</i>

42
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,650
<i>And you need a break
more than anyone.</i>

43
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:06,920
<i>And if you don't respect
her boundaries just this once,</i>

44
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,025
<i>you could lose her forever.</i>

45
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,795
Ah, fuck. Fine.

46
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:13,066
<i>Walk your sand in the... in...</i>

47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,603
<i>Walk your feet in the sand.</i>

48
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,876
<i>See how many footprints
are left or whatever.</i>

49
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,322
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

50
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:26,468
There, now I can't text
or call Chrissy for 24 hours.

51
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:27,796
And if I try, my heart explodes,

52
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:29,676
and my soul gets trapped
in this spider forever.

53
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,245
<i>If you became
a little spider gal,</i>

54
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,806
<i>I'd treat you just the same.</i>

55
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:35,511
<i>Have you met my cousins yet?
They're a hoot and a half.</i>

56
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:37,816
Uh, yep.
Apples don't fall far

57
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,853
from the Darlene family tree,
that's for sure.

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,465
<i>One time at Patty's Shrimp Hut,</i>

59
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,095
<i>we got so wasted off their
cocktail-sauce martinis,</i>

60
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:47,702
<i>we set the place ablaze
just to see the hot firemen.</i>

61
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:48,904
What is that?

62
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:51,075
<i>Anyway, see ya!</i>

63
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:52,645
- Hey, there, neighbor!
- Ah, shit!

64
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,916
What are you doing
out here so early, Dorlene?

65
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,653
It's the only time
I could get my jog in

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,591
without these seagulls
picking at my eczema.

67
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,229
Listen, I heard all about your
mother-daughter blowout,

68
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:02,665
BT-dubs... yikes.

69
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:03,768
Yeah, yikes.

70
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,172
I had a daughter once,
so I totally get it.

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,577
Anyhoo, got to rake
in those steps.

72
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:10,380
Oh, oh, and if you're game,

73
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,519
we do a bonfire every Friday
night on the beach.

74
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:15,157
Bonfire Balaban we call it,
after Bob Balaban.

75
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,127
Love <i>Little Man Tate.</i>

76
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:18,296
Ha ha. Okay, great.

77
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:20,400
I'd rather hang myself
by my labia.

78
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,706
Sounds good.

79
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,212
Woo-hoo-hoo!

80
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,183
Holy shit!

81
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,726
I am Khaleesi!

82
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,428
Ha ha!

83
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:37,167
Look at me now, Mom!
I'm on a mother-jumping dragon!

84
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,305
Oh, sorry, Frances...

85
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,742
Cockatrice.

86
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,979
I'm on a mother-jumping
cockatrice!

87
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:44,750
Whoo!

88
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:47,722
Cockatrice, ya bish!

89
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,125
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

90
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:50,528
Little better than a pony ride.

91
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,832
Goddamn that was awesome,
Daddy-o.

92
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,203
Hey, Snakey,
mix me up something sweet.

93
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,540
Surprise me, honey.

94
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:58,276
Copo Copo Canyon's
got cameras set up

95
00:03:58,343 --> 00:03:59,646
like an amusement park.

96
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:02,017
I saved a couple of my faves.
Check them out.

97
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,599
Freedom looks good on you, girl.

98
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:06,058
Ah, never felt so alive...

99
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,428
No dishes to deal with,

100
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:09,498
no dictator breathing
down my neck.

101
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,436
It's all chill here.
Do whatevs you want.

102
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:14,074
Sweet. I'm going to take
a nap on a pile of slugs.

103
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,645
Take a lame-ass nap?

104
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,450
Come on, you spent your whole
life on Earth with Pussolini.

105
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:19,886
Get back out there.

106
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:21,723
Meet some creatures
your own age.

107
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,729
You got the whole M realm
at your fingy-tips.

108
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:26,208
Blammo.

109
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,036
This is iSatan.

110
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,575
In case you get lost, some
losers try to mess with you,

111
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,614
you fall in a toilet,
just push, and, poof,

112
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,486
I, Satan, will appear.
- Whoa.

113
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:38,958
And I can go anywhere?
- Anywhere.

114
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:41,095
- Nothing's off-limits?
- Not a thing.

115
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:43,032
Not even
GunsandMethlandia Plaza?

116
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,038
I wouldn't start with that
one, but the sky's the limit.

117
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,407
Now get out of here.

118
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:48,878
Come on, Frances, little girl.

119
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:49,944
Ya!

120
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,750
Catch ya later, Pop!

121
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:55,056
Damn, I just got
a major FOMO attack.

122
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:57,795
Snakey, grab that box of drugs
I found on the corpse

123
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,064
of that goblin DJ.

124
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,435
Let's get queasy.

125
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:05,912
Oh, come on.

126
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:08,449
Tessa doesn't belong
on reality TV.

127
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,988
Are we really doing this, Laura?

128
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,061
Okay.

129
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:15,841
Well, I think Rita is using
Kenneth for his heliport

130
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,436
because he's been sleeping
with Tessa since season five.

131
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,016
Two episodes ago,
her son got divorced.

132
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,477
She doesn't care
about no heliport right now.

133
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,616
Oh, my God, you made it.
Grab a chair.

134
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,419
Oh, this is Laura,
Darlene's friend.

135
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,256
This is Durlawn,
Dirlane, and Dave.

136
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:29,693
- Hey.
- Welcome, hon.

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,471
We're talking about
<i>Shit Wives of Myrtle Beach.</i>

138
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,497
That reality show?

139
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:33,734
Didn't that get banned

140
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,505
for the insane amount
of drunk driving?

141
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,274
That and incest,
and only in a few states.

142
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:39,513
Laura's here for a little R&R.

143
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,984
Ah, you know who else
apparently needed some R&R?

144
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,787
Heather Dombaco.

145
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,527
She lost her shit
when she found out her husband

146
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,597
was getting his butt
fingered at the gym,

147
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,668
and no one's seen her since.

148
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,705
Wow, Shit Wives
of Myrtle Beach gets wild.

149
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:54,341
That wasn't on <i>Shit Wives.</i>

150
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:55,912
Heather's from around here.

151
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,416
She went missing
a couple of weeks ago.

152
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,420
Some think she went on a bender.

153
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,457
But if you ask me...

154
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:06,733
I know it was the sea hag.

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,078
- Jesus Christ.
- It was only a matter of time.

156
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,815
Here she goes again
with the goddamn sea hag.

157
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,510
Sea hag... is that what you call

158
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,523
some old lady on the beach
who stole your husband?

159
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,618
Oh, no.
Ethel and I are friends now.

160
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,956
Sea hag's a true beast
from the sea.

161
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:21,697
She roams the beach
searching for bodies to devour.

162
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:24,803
The sadder they are,
the more likely to be eaten.

163
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:28,443
She feeds on loneliness
and human flesh...

164
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,313
A horrid, repulsive creature.

165
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:35,357
Fishermen have gone
missing, pets, children.

166
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:37,194
I've been hunting her for years,

167
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:39,131
but she always escapes me.

168
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,503
One day, just wait.

169
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,908
One day, just you wait.

170
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,680
Wait day one.
Just wait one day, one...

171
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:49,118
Durlawn's been using
sea hag as an excuse

172
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:51,599
for why no one wants to stay at
her inn for the past 20 years.

173
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,469
- That's true.
- Shut the fuck up, will you?

174
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,763
Hey, hey, hey.

175
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,509
Well, actually, I did see
something feeding

176
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,735
out on the jetty today,

177
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,639
but it was probably a seal
or something.

178
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,008
I told you she's back.

179
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,879
The fucking sea hag's back.

180
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,481
Give me the spear gun, honey.

181
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,419
- Who saw that coming?
- A mess.

182
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:07,932
Well, I'm gonna
go get incredibly high

183
00:07:07,956 --> 00:07:09,893
and take a stroll...
Good luck with all that.

184
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,763
Good night now.
- Watch out out there!

185
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,303
Sea hag's gonna eat you.
She eats babies, I tell ya!

186
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,217
Are you... That fucking
asshole is letting her...

187
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,388
Oh, God, and he ruined my high.

188
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:26,192
Fuck it.
I'm reversing this spell.

189
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,100
Whew, let's take
a quick break here.

190
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,137
You need a number one,
number two?

191
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:34,108
It all comes out of one place
for birds, right?

192
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:35,611
That's cray.

193
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:37,849
Damn, girl, I am lost.

194
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,915
You lost?

195
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,921
Uh...
Me? No.

196
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:42,692
Exactly where
I'm supposed to be.

197
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,796
Just taking a breather.
Been going hard all day.

198
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:47,702
You know how us rebel teens
are, you know.

199
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,572
You're cute.

200
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,309
Uh, do you know
anything fun to do?

201
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,048
I mean, anything
else in the metaphysical realm?

202
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:56,485
Raponga, it's
the hottest club in the Fringe.

203
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,323
Me and the Moth Boys
are headed there now.

204
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:01,495
Whoa, cool. Uh, yeah, I mean,
maybe I'll check it out

205
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,399
if I'm not too, uh, busy.

206
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,703
You dig, cowgirl?

207
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,138
You're nailing this, Chrissy.

208
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:08,376
Whoa.

209
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:12,819
Whoa, lighty.

210
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,656
Thanks, bro.

211
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,292
Classic us, right?

212
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,995
See you there, maybe.

213
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,666
Uh, yeah, yeah, maybe.

214
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,337
Maybe not.
Maybe, maybe. Ha ha!

215
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:25,010
Raponga, here we come.

216
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,279
Come on, strike me!

217
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:45,551
Strike me!

218
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:47,054
I said strike...

219
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:13,507
W-what is that?

220
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,009
Get away from me.
- Calm down.

221
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:16,856
If you try to eat me,
I swear to God I will fucking...

222
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,982
- Calm down.
- Ah! Ow.

223
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,953
- It burns for a second.
- Ah!

224
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:22,300
You're lucky you're not dead.

225
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,104
Yeah, why am I not dead?
Why didn't you eat me?

226
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,867
I'm talking about you hitting
your head and drowning, moron,

227
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,613
plus whining at the sky...

228
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:29,873
"Oh, strike me.

229
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,342
Strike me, please,
daddy lightning."

230
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:34,181
You mean you saw me command
the fuck out of lightning,

231
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,183
you baby-eating bitch.

232
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,456
I ate one baby
one time on a dare.

233
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:40,427
And I was fucking with you. Jesus.

234
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,773
You put up a good fight, though.

235
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,266
That was kind of cool.

236
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,234
I'm sure you say that

237
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,814
to all the humans
you're gonna swallow.

238
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:48,610
Keep talking shit,
and I just might.

239
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,748
You dropped this.

240
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,451
Daughter?
Niece?

241
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:53,887
- No.
- Student?

242
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,591
No, and none
of your goddamn business.

243
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:56,936
If you say lover,
I will eat you.

244
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,405
Why don't you fuck
back off to the ocean

245
00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,766
where you belong, please?

246
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,178
Oh, I'm going
but mainly because of them.

247
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:03,005
- There she is.
- Holy shit!

248
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:06,212
Durlawn was right!
- My worldview has crumbled.

249
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:07,214
- Hey.
- What?

250
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,517
You want to come?

251
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,864
Why the fuck
would I go with you?

252
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,122
Well, from where I'm standing,

253
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:14,696
you seem fucking miserable
on land.

254
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,967
Careful, she eats babies.

255
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,173
Up to you,
but I'm leaving either way.

256
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,379
Fuck it.
I got 24 hours, and that's it.

257
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:39,579
You're making me a fish?

258
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,083
What's next? I feed you
a hard-boiled egg or something?

259
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,221
I gave you the ability
to speak underwater,

260
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:46,993
and I could take it right back.

261
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,566
Where are we going?
- Deeper.

262
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:52,370
Much deeper.

263
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,135
Who the fuck are these sea dogs?

264
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:44,441
Vodyanorwens,
pirates of the abyss.

265
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,412
Ooh, scary.

266
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,286
You thinking what I'm thinking?

267
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:53,192
Only if you, too,
are a complete psychopath.

268
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,367
Hey, pissy bitch!

269
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,271
Hey, why don't you pick
on some titties

270
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:00,273
your own size, huh?

271
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,377
Want me to squeeze those things?

272
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:03,880
Let's motorboat.

273
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,495
Yeah, yeah, get in there, huh?

274
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:33,540
- Thank you.
- Wow.

275
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,076
Still hot and unfiltered.

276
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,480
Hey, that's the name
of my stand-up special.

277
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,585
- Oh. Ugh.
- Come on.

278
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,231
Do you know
if they have a cover?

279
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,125
Be a good girl.
I love you.

280
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,638
Oh, you got to try
the wings here.

281
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:45,662
They're wonderful.

282
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,668
Sorry, little girls
ain't allowed.

283
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,610
Oh, snap, I underestimated
you due to your stature

284
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,778
and probably gender.

285
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,314
I've done this to my daughter.

286
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,181
She brought it to my
attention multiple times.

287
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:58,389
I'm trying.
Come right in.

288
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:01,295
Making so many
bad decisions tonight.

289
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,741
Hey, pour it down me gope hole.

290
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,478
- Pour it down me gope hole.
- Hey, no offense,

291
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:06,740
but I want to eat
your testicles... is that cool?

292
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:08,910
Wow, what is this place?

293
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:11,315
Your best worst nightmare.

294
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,724
Hey, would
you like a Brain Bleed?

295
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,730
It's actually just elf tongue,
oat milk, and gasoline.

296
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,433
It's super tasty.

297
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,670
You're good?

298
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,774
All right,
have a good one, then.

299
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,453
I've got fucking cum
coming out of my ear holes.

300
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,326
Care to dance?

301
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:35,163
Ah, I think we're just
dancing as a group,

302
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:36,833
like a group thing, you know?

303
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,503
Oh, a group thing.
Yes, of course.

304
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,406
I'll be on my way.

305
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:58,009
Ah!

306
00:13:58,075 --> 00:13:59,444
Looking for something?

307
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:00,848
Oh, hi.

308
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,514
Uh, I thought this
was, uh, the bathroom.

309
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,263
But, uh, there was, like, uh,
this girl I met...

310
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,758
Red hair, fairy-like, and...

311
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,127
You mean Red?

312
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,964
Oh, yeah, that would make sense.

313
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,035
She's in here.
Come inside.

314
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:16,913
Sounds like an ASMR video
in here.

315
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,484
Hungry?

316
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:24,705
Then I handed him
the gas nozzle,

317
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,465
and I said,
"Well, if you're not pushing,

318
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,434
start sucking, buddy."

319
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,739
I mean, it was...

320
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:31,442
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

321
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,118
You okay?

322
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:37,988
Um...
Yeah.

323
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,661
Yeah, I honestly haven't
felt this alive in...

324
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:41,663
I don't even know how long.

325
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,466
Then what's up?

326
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,606
Ah, that picture you asked me
about, my daughter, I...

327
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,877
I just really messed things up
with her and...

328
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:52,217
Ah, and now you don't deserve
any happiness, right?

329
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:54,020
It's just better to stick
with self-torment?

330
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,691
Look, from the time
she was born,

331
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:59,932
I've fucked up over and over
and over again as her mom.

332
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,237
Maybe I just don't deserve happiness.

333
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,809
That's how I felt
after my first litter hatched

334
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,211
a few thousand years ago.

335
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:08,750
I didn't know how
to raise jack shit.

336
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:11,054
While they were home alone,
I was out fooling around

337
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,426
with the Midgard Serpent
and the Wolf Fenrir.

338
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:16,733
Then they found out about each
other, and, boom, Ragnarok.

339
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,570
- No way. Seriously?
- Yeah.

340
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:21,275
Helen of Troy
does not have shit on me.

341
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:22,745
Oh.

342
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:24,092
Anyway, I started feeling guilty

343
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:27,220
about my choices as a mom,
and that feeling spread,

344
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,026
and I began using that guilt
and that shame

345
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,796
as a compass through life.

346
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:33,533
And you know what that did?

347
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,840
It just made me
a worse fucking mom.

348
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,144
I wish I'd been nicer to myself,

349
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:41,348
given myself a break.

350
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,689
Give yourself a fucking break.

351
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,233
Today was the nicest thing

352
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:53,372
anyone's done for me
in a long time.

353
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,980
Yeah, it feels nice, huh,
being taken care of?

354
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,507
- Take me.
- Take me first.

355
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:12,310
Come on, serve me up
on a platter.

356
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:13,613
Now shut up.

357
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,351
Ow!

358
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:19,859
- What the...
- Fuck, dude?

359
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:21,028
What the fuck?

360
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,430
I don't know about you boys,

361
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,569
but I still got room
for dessert.

362
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:27,675
My tum-tum's always
got room for dessert.

363
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,120
Ah!

364
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:37,895
Dad, where the fuck are you?

365
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,264
Oh, my God.

366
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,634
I've tasted a lot of floors,

367
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,538
but this is the best
I've ever tasted.

368
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:43,907
Next drug!

369
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,511
Run.

370
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,013
Go.

371
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,550
Go.

372
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,762
Ugh, my balls.
My mothballs!

373
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,799
Get her!

374
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:01,408
Please help. I...

375
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:05,216
I'll have what she's having.

376
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:06,695
Uh, excuse me.
I need a drink.

377
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,725
Damn it. Only because it's
my last resort.

378
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,963
Mom, come on, pick up.

379
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,875
- Are you shitting me?
- Hurry!

380
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:20,246
Get that demon shit.
- Okay, bye-bye.

381
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:23,152
Have fun, kids. Don't get
into too much trouble.

382
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,705
Oof.
Damn.

383
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:34,885
Thought for a sec I was going
to lose my larynx back there.

384
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:37,480
Oh, mermaid, huh?

385
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,050
Yeah.

386
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:40,554
No judgment.

387
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,156
Oh, okay.

388
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:44,528
I thought it was
hilarious at the time.

389
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,098
Yeah, I bet.

390
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,106
Look, I got to... I got to go.

391
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:51,776
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

392
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,680
I'll, uh... I'll take you.

393
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,165
I fucking missed her call.

394
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:04,769
Shit.
Fuck.

395
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,347
I can't believe I did that.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

396
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:07,817
- Where is that goddamn spider?
- One sec. Stop.

397
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:09,521
- Do you see a spider?
- Stop for one second.

398
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,683
- What?
- Hear me out.

399
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:13,285
Don't go.
- What?

400
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:14,855
No.
What if she's in trouble?

401
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:18,730
What if you need to put
your guilt aside just once?

402
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,399
Ask yourself why this

403
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,540
is the best you've felt
in a long time.

404
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,309
Look, you may live
in a fantasy world

405
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,080
where you get
to consume sea pirates

406
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:28,650
and drop squid ink all day,

407
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:31,154
but I have responsibilities
that I can't walk away from.

408
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:32,691
I'm not saying forever.

409
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,461
I have to do what's best
for my daughter.

410
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,007
Why don't you go find
your fucking litter and...

411
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,168
Yeah, maybe this is what's
best for her. What about...

412
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,607
No, this is selfish,
and so are you.

413
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:43,212
I'm actually more mammal
than a crus...

414
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:47,353
Oh, honestly,
thought you said "shellfish."

415
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,359
It's kind of funny.

416
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:53,633
So, uh, this is it I guess.

417
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,173
Yes.

418
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:13,339
Yum, yum.

419
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,443
- Leave me alone.
- Okay.

420
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,380
Yeah, let's stop, guys.

421
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,152
Just fucking kidding.
That was sarcasm.

422
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,732
You're not cut out
for this world, sweetie.

423
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:23,425
So we're going to take you
out of it.

424
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,764
I'm going to eat you
like a cashmere sweater.

425
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,237
I'm going to scarf you down
like you're a fucking scarf.

426
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:33,513
Oh, yeah, she's...

427
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,719
- Oh.
- Lighty.

428
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:38,088
Whoa.

429
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:41,161
<i>Elf tongue,
oat milk, and gasoline.</i>

430
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:42,865
<i>It's super tasty.</i>

431
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,902
You motherfuckers!

432
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:47,106
Whoosh!
- Oh, oh!

433
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:49,377
Oh, God, he's on fire!

434
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,791
I'll take care of it myself!

435
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,705
- We got her!
- We got the sea hag!

436
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,942
Let me go, you ugly yokels!

437
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,080
Fucking stupid fucking cousins.

438
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:08,550
- Hold still, hag.
- Ooh-hoo!

439
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:10,419
- Does she smell.
- Just hold still.

440
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:12,090
We caught her.
We finally caught her.

441
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,862
Let her go, guys.

442
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,603
I think maybe you need to put
down that weapon, hon.

443
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,239
You don't want to kill her.

444
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,026
Sure, some of the rumors
about her are true,

445
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:26,151
but the real issue is
you're scared she may be right

446
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:28,422
about what you need
for yourself.

447
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:30,527
And that's why this decision
is one of the hardest

448
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,564
you've ever had to make.

449
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,009
- She lost it.
- I think she has a point.

450
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,737
Almost sounds more
about her than us.

451
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,975
Tough tits, gal.
We're doing this for Heather.

452
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,547
It's what Tessa did in
the third episode last season

453
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,518
for Jeanette...
- Ugh, more Shit Wives stuff?

454
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:43,686
Come on.

455
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:45,557
That's not why Tessa
shot Jeanette's husband.

456
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:46,993
She did it because he bankrolled

457
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,865
his ex-wife for her
new Gemini beauty line.

458
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:52,136
You watch
<i>Shit Wives of Myrtle Beach?</i>

459
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:55,276
Watch it? Hell, I swim down
there and have dinner

460
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:56,646
with them every other month.

461
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,282
And if you want the goss...

462
00:20:58,348 --> 00:20:59,417
Ooh, dish, baby.

463
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:00,921
What's Jessica Junior like?

464
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:04,260
Ugh, the literal worst,
and I dated a basilisk.

465
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:05,931
Bye, fish lady.

466
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:09,605
Yeah, next Sunday it is,
and I'll bring the net.

467
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:11,709
I don't trust you anymore.

468
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,947
Wow, it's good
to see you making friends.

469
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,025
I think it'll take a while

470
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,921
to, like, let them know
I did eat Heather.

471
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,729
I thought you didn't
want to see me again.

472
00:21:21,796 --> 00:21:24,467
I couldn't let you get captured.

473
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,240
I don't want to say we'll
never see each other again.

474
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:29,010
Hey, give me your arm.

475
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,289
If you decide to leave
your life behind

476
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:37,059
or you want to see me,

477
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:41,034
you can press this tattoo
and call my name five times.

478
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:42,436
Huh, kind of like Candyman.

479
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:44,875
Just like Candyman.

480
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,606
Ah, what? What?

481
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,576
Don't strong-arm me, Snakey.

482
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:20,580
Chrissy, you're back.

483
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,183
How'd it go out there?

484
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,452
Have a little Rumspringa?

485
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,256
I called you,
and you didn't come.

486
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:27,026
That's what happened.
- Oh, shit.

487
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:28,228
Sorry, hon.

488
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:30,600
Snake started pushing
his drug stash on everyone

489
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,470
like some kind of methed-out
ice cream man.

490
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:33,940
I think he's got
a genuine problem.

491
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,111
I really needed you,
and you didn't show.

492
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:37,981
You and mom both fucking suck.

493
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:39,384
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

494
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,796
Where are you going?
- To Bennigan's.

495
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,989
I know he hates me right now,

496
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,427
but he may at least
mildly give a shit about me.

497
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:46,197
Don't follow me.
- No, I-I-I...

498
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,734
Aw, shit.
Aw, shit.

499
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,105
Aw, shit. Aw, shit!

500
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,509
This is all your fault.

501
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,784
What are you, my sponsor?

502
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,890
Oh, yeah. Okay.

503
00:22:58,957 --> 00:22:59,957
Thank you.

504
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:09,678
Laur, you made it
back in one piece, huh?

505
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:12,483
A little R&R didn't kill you.
- Almost.

506
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,487
But, yeah, you were right.
I-I needed that.

507
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:15,890
Thanks for letting me stay.

508
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:17,728
Sure did make a big splash
with my cousins.

509
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:20,266
Now they're going to make
sea hag T-shirts,

510
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,936
sea hag bags, sea hag necklaces.

511
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:24,407
And they're opening up a gift
shop to sell novelty items.

512
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:26,077
It's all about
perspective, right?

513
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:28,081
I guess.
What are you doing here anyway?

514
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:30,252
I thought you'd be going
to find Chrissy by now.

515
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,956
Yeah, you know, I-I just figure,

516
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:34,962
when Chrissy's ready,
she'll come home.

517
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,335
Right?

518
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:40,707
As soon as I rebuild it.
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:43,245
If you need a good contractor,
Dorlene is excellent.

520
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:44,949
She charges way too much,

521
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:47,353
but give her a bag of Bugles,
she'll take 10% off the top.

522
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:52,831
Yeah, she'll come around
when she's ready.

523
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:03,018
Huh.
They know I'm coming.

524
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:08,963
Hello?

525
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,867
Anybody home?

526
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:19,017
Bennigan, oh, my God.
What...

527
00:24:21,354 --> 00:24:22,924
We meet again.

528
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:24,762
What?
Who the hell are you?

529
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:28,503
Who the hell am I?
Uh, your archnemesis.

530
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,439
Archnemesis?
I don't even know you.

531
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:31,876
- You don't even...
- Fuck.

532
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:34,314
Did you do this because of me?
- Yes!

533
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,386
Are you fucking kidding me?
It never stops.

534
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,292
It does now.

535
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,233
