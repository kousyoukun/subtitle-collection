00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,950
我看見你了
I saw you!

本WEB版外掛字幕由  風吹來的那片云  雙語合并

9
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,640
天啊 好頭痛 簡直...
God, this headache, it just--

10
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,480
好難受 我的視線都模糊不清了
It's hard. I can't really-- I can't see properly.

11
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,940
要不要再播放一次
Can we play it again?

12
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,010
喬
Jo!

13
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,220
跟你記憶中一樣嗎
Is that how you remember it?

14
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
不一樣
No.

15
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,770
哪里不一樣
What's different about it?

16
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,360
我們不是用瑞典語交談
We weren't speaking Swedish.

17
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,190
那你完全不會說瑞典語嗎
So you don't speak Swedish at all?

18
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,490
只是聽得懂一些
I can kind of understand it.

19
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,030
但是我不會 媽咪 我不會說瑞典語
But no, Mummy, I can't speak it.

20
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,120
我記得你說的是英語
The way I remember it, you were speaking English,

21
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,530
你還說到冷原子實驗
and you were talking about the CAL.

22
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,830
冷原子實驗
The CAL?

23
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,500
你說他們在做一項實驗
You said that they were doing an experiment.

24
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,790
你跟我說...
You told me that--

25
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,800
保羅在做一項實驗
that Paul was doing an experiment.

26
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,680
愛麗絲 問題是 我...
Thing is, Alice, I--

27
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,100
發生意外前 我對冷原子實驗毫無印象
I don't remember the CAL before the accident.

28
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,390
我對那項實驗毫無印象 我不...
I don't remember anything about it. I don't--

29
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,850
我完全不記得了
I don't remember it at all.

30
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,730
那到底是什么
What is it?

31
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,740
亨利說那個東西跟什么物理學有關
Henry said it was something to do with, like, physics.

32
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,660
那是一項量子實驗
It's a quantum experiment.

33
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,580
主要用來捕捉量子疊加形態
It's supposed to capture a quantum superposition.

34
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,870
什么是量子疊加狀態
What's that?

35
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,590
就是指同一件東西能同時出現在兩個地方
Well, it's sort of like when one thing can exist in two places at the same time.

36
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,610
還有一個寫著你名字的卡帶
There's another one with your name on it.

37
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,490
要不要聽
Shall we?

38
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,830
上面的日期是什么
What's the date on it?

39
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,460
“2021年10月15日”
"10th of the 15th, 2021."

40
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,840
這是意外發生后隔天
It's the date after the accident.

41
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,640
休士頓 我想知道將尸體運返地球的流程
Houston, what are the protocols on dealing with a dead body?

42
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,560
太空站 你有什么擔憂
Station, what's your concern?

43
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,770
我的擔憂是...
My concern...

44
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,820
我的擔憂是...
The concern is...

45
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,150
艾利遜的傷口嚴重裂開
Ericsson is so badly lacerated.

46
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,320
我擔心尸體搬進救生艙后 一旦離開零重力...
My concern is that when the body gets out of zero-G--

47
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,040
也許沒必要聽
Maybe we don't need to listen to these.

48
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,290
也許我只需要想個辦法
Maybe I just need to work it out.

49
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,870
好的
Okay.

50
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,130
媽咪
Mummy?

51
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,880
沒事的 別擔心
It's gonna be okay. Don't worry.

52
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,260
我去做些意大利面 然后一起抱抱 接著...
Just gonna make some pasta for us. We could just cuddle up, and--

53
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,380
媽咪
Mummy.

54
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,890
你覺得我跟以前一樣嗎
Am I the same to you?

55
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,850
你說什么
Sorry?

56
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,230
我是你的愛麗絲嗎
Am I your Alice?

57
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,280
- 我... - 對不起
- I... - Sorry.

58
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,250
愛麗絲 別這么說 你不用道歉 不是...
Oh, no, you mustn't be sorry, Alice. It's not--

59
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,210
我只是覺得你不像我的媽媽
I just don't feel like you're my mum.

60
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,880
我真的不像你媽媽嗎
It doesn't feel that way?

61
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,470
不像
No.

62
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,560
但我們必須想想辦法
But we have to work it out.

63
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
我們...
We--

64
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,860
我們只是需要想想辦法
We just-- We just need to work it out.

65
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,010
你通知艾琳娜了嗎
Did you speak to Irena?

66
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,470
她在路上了
She's on her way here.

67
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,230
她來干嗎
Why is she on the way here?

68
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,480
因為她會負責照顧你太太
Because she's the one who will take care of your wife.

69
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,570
天啊
Jesus Christ.

70
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,290
不好意思 那你又來干嗎
And sorry, what are you doing here again?

71
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,290
你那部機器對人有害無利 不是嗎
I mean, your machine's no bloody good to anyone now, is it?

72
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,080
我來是因為這事也曾發生在我身上
I'm here because this happened to me as well.

73
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,400
(美國宇航局)

74
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,160

媽媽
Mamma?

79
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360

80
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,400
嘿
Hey.

81
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
有人嗎
Hello?

82
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,950
媽媽
Mamma!

83
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,810
救救我
Help!

84
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
愛麗絲
Alice?

85
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,040
媽媽
Mamma.

86
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,870
愛麗絲 寶貝 說話啊
Alice, baby, talk to me.

87
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,090
為什么躲在櫥柜里
Why did you hide in the cupboard?

88
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,010
- 寶貝  - 我害怕
- Baby? - I was scared.

89
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,380
媽媽

90
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,340
爸爸呢
Where's Daddy?

91
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,560
聞起來像你的味道
You smell like you again.

92
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,980
不然像誰的味道
Who else should I smell like?

93
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,160
可能會有點刺痛
This might sting a little bit.

94
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,580
但你很快就暖和起來了
But it's gonna get you warm.

95
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,160
好了 沒事了
There you go. There you go.

96
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,830
糟糕 熱水沒了
Oh, no. We're out of hot water.

97
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,290
我去給你燒些熱水
I'm gonna boil you some more.

98
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,550
別走
Don't go.

99
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,840
別走
Don't go.

100
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,420
媽媽 我好冷
Mamma. I'm cold.

101
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,430
媽咪
Mummy?

102
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,780

103
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,340
愛麗絲  我在這里
Alice? I'm here. I'm here.

107
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,670
怎么回事 你去了哪里
What happened? Where have you been?

108
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,970
我看見她了
I saw her.

109
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,890
她在那邊 在外面的大雪中
She's there, out in the snow.

110
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,060
你從外面回來嗎
Have you been out there in the snow?

111
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,140
我看見媽媽了
I saw Mamma.

112
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,810
她沒事
She was fine.

113
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,390
她找到我了
She found me.

114
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,270
如今她又消失了
And now she's gone again.

115
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,900
親愛的 如果你真看到她... 我知道你以為看到她了
Honey, if you saw her-- I know you think you did--

116
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,450
那不是夢
It wasn't a dream!

117
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,490
我感受得到
I felt it.

118
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,490
我感受得到她的存在
I felt her.

119
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,660
我聞到她的味道
I smelt her.

120
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,120
我感受到雪的觸感
I felt the snow.

121
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,750
- 她剛剛就在那邊 - 她不在
- She was right there. - She wasn't.

122
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,290
真的 她剛剛就在那邊
She was. She was right there.

123
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,170
我已經沒辦法了
I don't know what to do.

124
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,010
走吧 趕緊讓你暖和起來
Come on. Let's just get you warm.

125
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,430
然后回到床上睡覺 好嗎
Let's get you back to bed, okay?

126
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,940
什么
What?

127
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,690
- 她在哪里  - 誰啊
- Where is she? - Who?

128
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,900
你啊
You.

129
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,440
我不懂什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

130
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,900
你沒看到自己嗎
Didn't you see yourself?

131
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,990
- 你是指鏡子中嗎  - 不是 在這里
- In the mirror? - No! Here.

132
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,740
媽咪 我什么都沒看到
Mummy, I didn't see anything.

133
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,240
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

134
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,950
快去換衣服 那邊還有一間小木屋
Get dressed. There's another cabin.

135
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,080
跟我們的小木屋一樣 但不是我們的小木屋
It's like our cabin, but it's not our cabin.

136
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,420
是不是跟卡帶有關
Is this about the tapes?

137
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,790
趕緊穿上雪地裝備 我們要過湖
Put your snow gear on. We've got to go across the lake.

138
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,960
媽咪 我對我說過的話向你道歉
Mummy, I'm sorry about what I said.

139
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,050
快去換衣服
Get dressed.

140
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,550
媽咪 我不是有意的
Mummy! I didn't mean it!

141
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,060
對不起 我們趕緊回去吧
I'm sorry. Let's just go back to how we were.

142
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,060
她剛剛躲在樓上的櫥柜里
She was hiding in the cupboard upstairs.

143
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,570
走吧
Let's go!

144
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,320
太冷了 她會凍死的 我們得趕緊找到她
It's too cold. She'll freeze. We gotta find her.

145
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,990
找誰
Who?

146
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,700
另一個你
The other you.

147
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,270
什么情況
What's this?

148
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
你好
Hello there.

149
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,900
這條路徹底堵住了
The road's completely blocked.

150
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,030
那趕緊去弄個鏟雪機啊
Well, get a digger.

151
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,190
在路上了
It's coming.

152
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,700
我等不了
Well, I'm not waiting.

153
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,240
我女兒被困在另一邊 我太太瘋了
My daughter's stuck out there, and my wife's crazy.

154
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,290
媽咪 我覺得另一間小木屋不存在
Mummy, I don't think there is another cabin.

155
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
快
Come on.

156
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,460
往這邊走
It's this way.

157
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,710
我肯定是這個方向
I'm sure it's this way.

158
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,510
快
Come on.

159
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,300
我覺得...
I think-- I think--

160
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
怎么了
What?

161
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,100
人難過時可能會看到幻象
People can see things sometimes when they're upset.

162
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,360
那些到過外太空的人都會看到幻象
People who have been to space before have seen things.

163
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,960
我不想傷害你
I don't wanna hurt you...

164
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,260
我真的不想讓你難過 但我認為你說得對
I really don't wanna make you upset, but I think you're right...

165
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,720
我認為你不是我的女兒
I don't think you're my daughter.

166
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,350
可是如果我不是你的女兒 那你又是誰
But, if I'm not, then who are you?

167
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,940
你對我媽咪做了什么
What have you done to my mummy?

168
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,440
我們一起找出真相吧
Let's find out together.

169
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,280
愛麗絲
Alice.

170
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,330
你瘋了 我要爸爸 我要回家找爸爸
You're crazy! I want Daddy! I want to go home to Daddy!

171
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,750
愛麗絲 別跑
Alice, wait!

172
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,130
愛麗絲
Alice!

173
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,150
愛麗絲 別跑
Alice, wait!

174
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,910
愛麗絲
Alice!

175
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,930
愛麗絲
Alice?

176
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,560
愛麗絲
Alice?

177
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,110
天啊 又來了
Oh, Christ. Not again.

178
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,160
媽媽
Mamma!

179
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,250
愛麗絲
Alice!

180
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,390
愛麗絲
Alice!

181
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,990
媽媽
Mamma!

182
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,140
媽咪
Mummy!

183
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,010
我好像找到了
I think I found it.

184
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,940
我找到另一間小木屋了
I've found the other cabin.

185
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,240
媽咪
Mummy?

186
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,810
愛麗絲
Alice?

187
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,650
愛麗絲
Alice?

188
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,900
愛麗絲 你聽得到嗎
Alice, can you hear this?

189
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,130
愛麗絲 你聽得到嗎
Alice, can you hear this?

190
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,270
愛麗絲
Alice?

191
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,940
如果聽得到 就說點什么
If you can hear this, say something.

192
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,190
如果聽得到 就說點什么
If you can hear this, say something.

193
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,000
喂
Hello?

194
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
喂
Hello?

195
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,930
什么
What?

196
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,610
愛麗絲
Alice!

197
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,820
愛麗絲
Alice!

198
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
愛麗絲
Alice!

199
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,710
愛麗絲 如果你不在屋里 我就要報警了
Alice, if you're not here, I'm gonna have to call the police.

200
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,130
喂 是愛麗絲嗎
Hello, Alice?

201
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,550
你在哪里
Where are you?

202
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,730
好像在小木屋里 在樓上
At the cabin. Kind of. Upstairs.

203
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,100
愛麗絲 夠了
Alice, that's enough.

204
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,200
在我們的小木屋里
Is it our cabin?

205
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,240
有點像我們的小木屋
It's like our cabin...

206
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,120
- 你在櫥柜里嗎  - 是的
- Are you in the cupboard? - Yes.

207
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,500
我看不到你
I can't see you.

208
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,640
那可能是不同的櫥柜吧
It's not the same cupboard, I guess.

209
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,450
那我們是同一個愛麗絲嗎
But we're the same Alice?

210
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
不知道
Don't know.

211
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,120
你那邊有一面鏡子嗎
Is there a mirror there?

212
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,210
有
Yes.

213
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,510
如果你往鏡子里看 我也會往鏡子里看
If you look in, I will too.

214
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,020
糟糕 我們被反鎖在里面了
Shit. We've locked ourselves in.

215
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,520
什么
What?

216
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,980
我們把自己反鎖在里面了
We've locked ourselves in.

217
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,530
喂
Hello?

218
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,860
你會說英語嗎
Do you speak English?

219
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,330
我女兒失蹤了
My daughter is missing.

220
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,120
我們在阿爾梅道北部的一間小木屋里
We're in a cabin on the north side of ?lmedalen.

221
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,880
她十歲大 請你們馬上到
She-She's ten years old. I need you to come quickly.

222
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,440
她跑到湖面上了 安全嗎
She's gone out on the lake. Is that safe?

223
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,810
她往湖面走去了
Well, that's where she's gone.

224
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,200
她認為這樣能找到她媽媽
She thinks she can find her mamma.

225
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,560
你看得到什么嗎
Can you see anything?

226
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,650
是你嗎
Is that you?

227
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,870
我們是一樣的嗎
Are we the same?

228
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,910
你在這里干嗎
What are you doing here?

229
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,210
在找我媽
Looking for my mum.

230
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,420
你見到她了嗎
Have you seen her?

231
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,590
見到了
Yeah.

232
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
她跑來把我拉出櫥柜
She came and took me out of this cupboard.

233
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,970
這個櫥柜
This cupboard?

234
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,020
是的
Yeah.

235
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,100
你住在小木屋里嗎
Are you staying at the cabin?

236
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
是的
Uh-huh.

237
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,280
你媽媽跟你住在一起嗎
Is your mamma staying there with you?

238
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,910
她做不到
She can't.

239
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,530
為什么
Why not?

240
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,330
因為她死了
'Cause she's dead.

241
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,790
你還在嗎
Hello?

242
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,670
對不起
Sorry.

243
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,760
不要緊的
That's okay.

244
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,390
她什么時候死的
When did she die?

245
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,350
她死在外太空 到現在還在太空站里
In space. She's still up there.

246
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,480
她是不是跟你說瑞典語
Did she speak Swedish with you?

247
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,060
是的
Yeah.

248
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,400
你們家的車是什么顏色
What color is your car?

249
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,570
是紅色
Red.

250
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,610
你媽媽也死了嗎
Is your mamma dead too?

251
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:41,580
我認為你的媽媽還活著 但我的媽咪已經死了
I think it's your mamma who's alive and my mummy who died.

252
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,790
她們好像交換了位置
I think they swapped places.

253
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,420
愛麗絲
Alice?

254
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,930
可以把她還給我嗎
Can I have her back?

255
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,330
究竟怎么回事
So, what happened?

256
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,330
是什么病 是精神崩潰嗎
What was it, like a breakdown?

257
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,210
當時我坐在指揮艙里
I was up there on the command module.

258
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,090
剛從月球返回地球
Just come back from the moon.

259
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,720
回航進入第16個小時后 艙內發生失壓事故
Sixteen hours in, there was a depressurization.

260
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,430
我兩個船員...
My crew...

261
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,180
在我看來 他們已經死了
It looked to me like they were dead.

262
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,720
我整個人也失去意識
I kinda blacked out.

263
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,350
恢復意識后 奇跡發生了 他們倆都好好的
The miracle happened when I came to, they were okay again.

264
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,110
回到地球后 我卻病了
When I came back to Earth, I wasn't.

265
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,240
- 那你是怎么好起來的  - 我吃了藥
- So, how'd you get better? - I took the pills...

266
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,530
然后用工作麻痹自己
and I threw myself into my work.

267
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,620
多久才康復
And how long did it take?

268
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,790
路通了 要不要跟來
We're ready. You coming?

269
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,880
預備
Ready!

270
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,550
- 愛麗絲 - 愛麗絲
- Alice! - Alice!

271
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,570
愛麗絲

272
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,180
愛麗絲
Alice?

273
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,870
有人嗎
Hello?

274
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
是我
It's me.

275
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,000
不是那個說瑞典語的愛麗絲
Not the one who speaks Swedish.

276
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,880
我們需要...
Well, we need to--

277
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,590
你在哪里
Where are you?

278
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,260
媽媽在這里
I've got Mamma here.

279
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,890
在櫥柜里嗎
In the cupboard?

280
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,140
不是 她就在這里
No. She's here.

281
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,440
我看不到她
I can't see her.

282
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,860
也聽不到她
I can't hear her.

283
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,530
愛麗絲
Alice?

284
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,400
看來你們只能通過我對話了
I think you have to speak through me.

285
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,630
閉嘴
Shut up.

286
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
閉嘴
Shut up!

287
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,640
亨利 我要去找你算賬
I'm coming to get you, Henry.

288
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,730
我遲早會找上你的
Sooner or later.

289
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,350
我一定會來找你的
I'm comin'.

290
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,900
聽好 到時我會把世界搞得天翻地覆
And boy, am I gonna fuck things up.

291
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,580
愛麗絲
Alice!

292
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
愛麗絲
Alice!

293
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,290
愛麗絲
