我是说 她 她什么时候回来
I mean... When... When is she coming back?

8
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,099
她也许不会回来了 你知道的 不是吗
She might not come back. You know that, don't you?

9
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,197
我不知道 我什么都不知道
No, I don't. I don't know anything,

10
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:08,139
所以别再吓唬我了好吗
so stop freaking me out, okay?

11
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,838
你自己已经吓坏了
Well, you already are freaking out.

12
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,299
我们能做的只有等待
All we can do is wait.

13
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,982
我更喜欢你昏睡时的样子 真的
I liked you better when you were catatonic. I really did.

14
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,519
行了 别哪壶不开提哪壶了
Oh, well, that's a really shitty thing to say.

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,056
好了 我要开灯了 不介意吧
All right. I'm... I'm getting the lights on. Are you okay?

16
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,182

嗯
Yeah.

64
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,633
吓人吗
Intimidating?

65
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,180
算不上 他们只问我
Not really. They just wanted to know

66
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,330
是怎么找到贝克曼警官的 我如实回答了
how I found Officer Beckman, and I told them.

67
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,300
你出门是为了检查暴风雨受损情况
You came out to check storm damage.

68
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,351
没错 还有什么事吗
Exactly. Can I help you with anything else?

69
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,390
你还没问我
You never asked.

70
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,896
问你什么
What's that?

71
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,606
关于吉姆・杜利
About Jim Dooley.

72
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,942
是啊 他们找到他了吗
Ah, yeah. They find him?

73
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,190
没有 找到了他当时开的那辆卡车
Nope. Found the truck he was driving.

74
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,440
但他还下落不明
But as for him, no sign.

75
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,160
也许是朝丹开枪后吓得跑路了
Maybe he got scared after he shot Dan and ran away.

76
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,740
徒步逃跑 你觉得会这样吗
On foot? You think so?

77
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,580
你想到什么了吗  克雷格
You got something on your mind, Craig?

丹・贝克曼是名好警官 也是我的好朋友
Dan Beckman was a good officer and a good friend.

79
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,010
杜利向屠狗一样杀了他
Dooley shot him down like a dog.

80
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,359
这种人就算遭遇什么不测
If something happened to the man who did that,

81
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,766
我也不会为他流一滴眼泪
I wouldn't exactly cry myself to sleep at night.

82
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,780
你呢 莉西
Would you, Lisey?

83
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,311
当然也不会
Absolutely not.

84
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,270
说不定他死了
Maybe he's dead.

85
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,151
有可能
Maybe he is.

86
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,020
如果他已经死了 
If he is, 

87
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,570
我相信总有一天会有人发现他的尸体的
I suppose someone will eventually stumble on the body.

88
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,450
我不这么觉得
I don't think they will.

89
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,536
为什么
No?

90
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,080
直觉
Just a feeling.

91
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,830
你有什么事瞒着我吗
Is there something you're not telling me?

92
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,920
嗯
Yeah.

93
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,850
快去吃派吧
Go on and get your pie.

94
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,477

悲伤就是寻宝游戏
Grief is the bool hunt.

103
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,360

Something Scott said.

跟我讲讲那些裹尸布里的人
I need you to tell me about the shrouded ones.

119
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,640
他们不是紧张症
Because they're not catatonic, are they?

120
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,330
他们也没有昏迷
And they're not in comas.

121

他们死了
They're dead.

124
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,810
他们中的大多数选择继续前行
Most of them go on.

125
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,350
但还有一些 选择留下
But some of them, they stay.

126
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,520
留在那里 至少会挺一会儿
They hold on, at least for a little while.

127

144
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,870
他说 是莉西的故事
Lisey's story, he said.

145
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,830
但他从未为你写过书 不是吗
But he never dedicated a book to you, did he?

146
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,250
每一本书都是为我写的
They were all for me.

147
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,070
{\an8}寻宝结束

148
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,070
{\an8}莉西的故事 斯科特・兰登

149
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,070
很久很久以前 莉西...
Once upon a time, Lisey...

150
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,920
有两兄弟住在宾夕法尼亚州
there were two brothers living on an isolated farm

151
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,340
一个与世隔绝的农场
in Pennsylvania.

152
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,580
一年秋天 哥哥犯病了
One year, in the autumn, the older brother got in the bad.

153
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,830
意思是 他成了杀人狂
Which is to say, he became homicidal.

154
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:08,600
所以男孩的父亲不得不杀了他
So the boy's father had to kill him.

155
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,040
弟弟在一座迷人的山坡下埋葬了哥哥
The younger brother buried him away on an enchanted hillside.

156
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,270
那个与世隔绝的农场里 生活还在继续
And life on the isolated farm went on.

157
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,900
而到了十一月
But by November...

158
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,735
我的三明治呢
Where's my sandwich?

159
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,820
来了 爸爸 马上
Coming, Daddy. It's coming.

160
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:32,324
留下来的两个人过得并不那么好
It wasn't much of a life for the two that were left.

161
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,786
美国要下地狱了 兄弟姐妹们
America is going to hell, brothers and sisters.

162
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,705
全世界都要下地狱了 随处可以见得
The entire world is going to hell. You see it everywhere you go.

163
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,084
金色牛犊 还有异教的笛声
Golden calf and the sound of the pagan flute.

164
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,169
我的三明治呢
Where's my goddamn fucking sandwich?

165
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,819
我对天发誓 你再不滚过来
I swear to God. If you don't get over here

166
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,339
把该死的三明治拿给我 我就
and give me my goddamn sandwich...

167
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,216
回家的路何在 上帝啊
... what's the way home? Jesus!

168
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,300
天主啊
Jesus!

169
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,760
通往天堂仅有一条路
But there's only true path to heaven.

170
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,393
那条路就是我 我就是真理 我就是明灯
I am the way. I am the truth. I am the light!

171
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,769
有一条路能通往前方
And there is a way forward,

172
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,064
有一条路能够克服 但你们要放弃
there's a way to get over, but you have to give over.

173
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,565
你们要放弃赌博
You have to give over on the gambling.

174
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,985
这上面都发霉了 这是霉 看到没
There's mold on it. That's mold. You see it?

175
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:12,239
看到了 我可以去穆丽便利店买个新鲜的面包
Oh, yeah. Um, I could go down to Mulie's and get a fresh loaf.

176
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,366
罐子里有钱
Uh, there's money in the can.

You eat it.

爸爸什么爸爸 我让你吃了它

不过有点霉
Just a little mold.

181
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,590
我让你吃了它 吃了它 吃了它

Chew it up. No! Don't you... Don't you dare. Now swallow it.

你敢吐出来 我就让你再吃进去
If you puke that up, I'll make you eat it again.

184

Swallow it.

185

00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,529
公司不能
The company can't afford

281
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,157
失去像兰登这样出色的电工
to lose a fine electrician like Al Landon.

282
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,360
所以我这就...
So, before I go...

283
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,958
给你 拿着吧
Here. Go on, take it.

284
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:39,418
这算我送给你的
It's from me to you.

285
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,710
这是送给你哥的
And here's one for your brother.

286
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,460
一瞬之间 莉西 最奇异的事情就这么发生了
All at once, Lisey, the strangest thing happened.

287
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,180
真希望我爸干掉他
I wished my daddy would kill him.

288
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,891
- 谢谢 - 不客气
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

289
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,687
你记得让他给我打电话
You just, uh, get him to give me a call.

290
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,810
- 能记住吧 - 没问题 先生
- All right? - Yes, sir.

291
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,560
那好
All right.

292
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,820
听着 我真为你骄傲
Listen, I'm very proud of you.

293
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,969
不过也就这样了 斯科特 
But it's over, Scoot. 

294
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,160
我完了 以后还会有人来
I'm going down. He won't be the last.

295
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,890
咱俩总有一个得死在这块地上 斯科特
One of us is gonna die on this farm, Scoot.

296
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,890
你我心知肚明
You know it and I know it.

297
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,610
会是谁呢 我还是你
Which one of us is it gonna be? Me or you?

298
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,240
不知道 老爸
I don't know, Daddy.

299
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,410
我给你玩个寻宝游戏
I made you a bool hunt.

300
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,830
保罗以前也玩过
Just like Paul used to do.

301
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,420
找到线索 得到奖励
Find a clue, get a prize.

302
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,342
看看这是什么
Let's see which one it's gonna be.

303
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:29,342
{\an8}想要保持健康 就要喝水

304
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,912
有些线索就是以前保罗设计的那次
Some of them were clues

305
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,220
最棒的寻宝游戏里的
from the best bool hunt Paul ever made.

306
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,650
现在滚蛋 快找
Now get the fuck out of here.

307
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,274
你不可能...不可能杀死幽灵 知道吗
You can't... you can't kill a ghost, you know?

308
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,652
你杀不死幽灵
You can't kill a ghost.

309
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:36,252
{\an8}最终线索在客厅 领奖品吧

310
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,550
对不起 斯科蒂
I'm sorry, Scotty.

311
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,220
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

312
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,644
天呐
Oh, God.

313
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,644
{\an8}杀死我 把我和保罗埋在一起 求你了 斯科特

314
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,610
我想背着他 莉西
I tried to take him, Lisey.

315
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,700
就像背着保罗一样 这也是他的意思
The way I took Paul. It was what he wanted.

316
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,540
试了好几次都没成功
I tried and tried, but I couldn't.

317
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,810
第二天 我去穆丽便利店 我说
The next day, I went down to Mulie's store and said,

318
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,775
我爸带上我哥走了 我觉得他们不要我了
"My daddy took my big brother, and I guess they up and left me."

319
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,619
老穆丽带我去见县上的警长
Old Mulie took me to the county sheriff,

320
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,280
警长就把我送到儿童福利院
and the sheriff took me to child welfare.

321
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,440
我以为他们一定会询问情况 最后找到他
I thought they'd ask questions and they'd find him,

322
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:17,700
结果没人问 也没人找
but they never did.

323
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,960
你是惟一了解我的人 我的小心肝
You were the only one who knew me, babyluv.

324
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,170
是你带给我光明 知晓我阴暗的一面
The one who gave me light and knew my darkness.

325
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,720
现在我再没有任何隐瞒
Now you know the last part of the story.

326
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:36,223
对你和盘托出 让我如释重负
And telling it has set me free.

327
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,620
长久以来 是你让我安定地活在世上
You've been the anchor that has held me in this world,

328
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,440
活在你我的世界里
our world, for so long.

329
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,200
是你一直在拯救我 莉西
You were always saving me, Lisey.

330
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,542
所以我才给你留下一个寻宝游戏
So I left you a bool hunt so you could save Amanda

331
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,000
你可以用来拯救阿曼达
and in case someone like Cole,

332
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,320
或者以防有科尔这种深空牛仔找上你的
another Deep Space Cowboy, should come after you.

333
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,759
但更主要地 
But mostly, 

334
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,760
留下寻宝游戏 你才能怀着记忆走下去
I left it so you could remember and go on.

335
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,982
这才是你真正的奖品 
That's your real prize. 

336
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:21,090
"这才是你真正的奖品"
"That's your real prize."

337
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:26,356
现在你终于彻底了解我了 我知道你一定可以
And now that you have all of me, I know you can.

338
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,810
亲吻你
Kisses.

339
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,611
无止息
At least a thousand.

340
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,990
莉西...
And, Lisey...

341
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,530
我爱你
I love you.

342
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,620
我也爱你 斯科特
I love you too, Scott.

343
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,710
我也爱你
I love you too.

344
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,870
我必须再见他一面
I need to see him one more time.

345
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,940
这个给你
Keep this.

346
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,660

348
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,930
宝贝
Baby.

349
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,640
小心肝
Babyluv.

350
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,190
关上门 你我四目相对
When the door closes, we're eye to eye.

351
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,450
只有你和我 莉西
It's just you and me, Lisey.

352
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,370
我爱你
I love you.

353
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,490
我爱你
I love you.

354
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,750
你看怎么样 宝贝
What do you think, babyluv?

355
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,800
嫁给我
Will we marry?

356
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,514
宝贝觉得这个可以安排
Babyluv thinks it's a plan.

357
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:51,974
请亲吻新娘
You may kiss the bride.

358
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,350
我曾拥有 惟有故事
Stories are all I had.

359
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,190
如今更兼有你
But now I have you.

360
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,320
每个故事里都有你
You're every story.

361
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,490
你占据了我的心 宝贝
You're my heart, kiddo.

362
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,700
这是我们的人生
This is our time now.

363
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,200
只有你和我
You and me.

364
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,750
要打造只属于你我的世界
We can make our own world.

365
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,420
莉西
Lisey.

366
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,710
