5
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,210
这和《遗迹》里的那支一模一样 我为你做的
It's exactly like the one in Relics. I made it for you.

6
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,790
是根魔杖
It's a magic wand.

好吧
Okay.

15
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,170
上一个能在化妆间门上
You know the last time, uh, a writer had a star

16
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,040
挂星星的作家还是
on his dressing room door, it's...

17
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,460
是啊 梦想成真
Yep. Living the dream.

18
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,760
赞助这次活动的书店有一名店员
Um, the staff from the bookstore who's sponsoring the event

没问题 不过我需要几分钟
Yeah, that's fine. Just give me a few minutes

21
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,520
先把状态调整好 好吗
to get myself together, okay?

22
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,600
当然
Absolutely.

23
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,460
不是吧
Oh, boy.

24
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,900
该死

25
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,090
兰登先生

I hate to rush you, but they're ready for you.

27
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,310
兰登先生 您听得到我说话吗
Mr. Landon, can you hear me?

28
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,360
兰登先生
Mr. Landon?

兰登先生 听得到我说话吗
Mr. Landon, can you hear me?

31

32
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,160
兰登先生
Mr. Landon!

33
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
兰登先生
Mr. Landon!

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,800
兰登先生
Mr. Landon.

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,760
兰登先生 开开门

- 兰登先生 - 我在这

39
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,040
我出来后卫生间门被锁上了
The, uh, bathroom door locked behind me.

40
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,412
麻烦你请保安把门打开 
Could you get security to open it 

41
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,120
然后帮我把手机取出来 可以吗
and grab my phone?

42
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,710
没问题
Sure.

43
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,630
我准备好了
I'm ready.

44
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,710

他从事写作多年 著有十本畅销书籍

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,122
女士们先生们

00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:08,940
让我们用热烈的掌声欢迎斯科特・兰登

很高兴站在这里 活着真好
Good to be here and great to be alive or what?

52
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,450
标志上说此池塘禁止游泳
The sign says no swimming in the pool!

53
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,740
我们有什么要对它说的吗 露营者们
And what do we say to that, campers?

54
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,910
跳进去就是了
Dive right in!

55
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,080
那标志是谁弄的
Who put that sign up?

56
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,120
搞笑的条子们
The fun police!

57
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,460
在朗读新书之前
Before I read to you from my new book...

58
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,390
我想先讲讲
... I thought I'd talk a

59
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,350
一本小说是怎样写成的
little about how a novel comes into being.

60
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,650
抱歉
Sorry.

61
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,240
别着急 斯科特
Take your time, Scott.

62
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,990
怎么回事
What's happening?

63
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,160
每一本
Every...

64
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,660
小说
... novel...

65
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,080
都是作者与故事之间的
is a... A struggle between the writer and the...

66
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,510
都是作者和故事的博弈
A struggle between the writer and the story.

67
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,470
而作者 至少就我来说
And the writer, well, at least this one...

68
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,770
总是在试图...
always tries...

69
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,190
掌控节奏
to hold on to keep control.

70
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,240
故事...
The story...

71
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,160
该死
Fuck.

72
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,330
- 天啊 - 你还好吗
- Oh. Oh, God. - You all right?

73
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,670
缓一缓吧 老兄
Take a break, man.

74
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,930
- 他手上的是血吗 - 怎么回事啊
- Is that blood on his hand? - What's going on?

75
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,770
- 给他点水 - 那是血吗
- Get some water. - Is that blood?

76
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,570
麻烦你们...
Can somebody...

77
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,870
给我妻子打个电话...
call my w-wife...

78
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
在场有医生吗
Is there a doctor in the house?

79
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,800
喂 老公 现在几点
Hey, babe. What time is it?

80
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,550
打电话的不是您的丈夫 兰登夫人
This isn't your husband, Mrs. Landon.

81
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,010
我是詹特森医生 这里是哈德逊山纪念医院
It's Dr. Jantzen at Hudson Hill Memorial Hospital.

82
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,680
您的丈夫今晚被送进医院
Your husband was admitted tonight.

83
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,220
什么 发生什么了
What? What... What happened?

84
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,570
他在柱廊剧场
He was at The Colonnade Theater,

85
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,850
进行朗读会途中昏倒
scheduled to give a reading and he collapsed.

86
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,020
等等 他 他 他还好吗
Wait a minute. Wait. Is... Is... Is he all right?

87
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,240
兰登夫人 我建议您
Mrs. Landon, I think you

88
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,440
尽快赶来医院
should get here as soon as you possibly can.

89
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,200
谢谢
Thank you.

90
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,540
- 兰登夫人 我很抱歉 - 他人在哪
- Mrs. Landon, I'm so sorry about... - Where is he?

91
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,960
詹特森医生应该正在里面等您
I believe a Dr. Jantzen is waiting for you inside.

92
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,010
他在车上咳嗽得很严重
He was coughing in the car and it was not light.

93
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,100
后来我去化妆间找他时
And then I came to see him in his dressing room...

94
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,540
- 好了 谢谢你 - 兰登夫人
- Okay, thank you. - Mrs. Landon.

95
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,730
- 你好 - 请跟我来

96
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,890
非常感谢 谢谢你
Thank you so much. Thank you.

97
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,840
莫里斯医生 请拨打112 莫里斯医生

98
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,690
- 詹特森医生 - 您好 兰登夫人
- Dr. Jantzen. - Hello, Mrs. Landon.

99
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,940
您比我预计的来得早 太好了
You got here much faster than I expected. That's good.

100
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,610
- 他人在哪 - 在楼上
- Where is he? - One floor up.

101
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,030
在场没有医生见过旧伤复发
None of us here have ever seen old wounds reopen.

102
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,660
他的肺 体液
His lungs, the water...

103
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,490
可以基本确定病原是病毒
The root cause is almost certainly viral,

104
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,740
但具体是什么病毒现在还无从得知
but as of now we have no idea what virus that might be,

105
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,200
能确定的只有病毒的感染速度极快
but only that it's taken hold with incredible speed.

106
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,870
他要求摘掉呼吸器
He requested to be taken off the ventilator.

107
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,130
什么 为什么
What? Why?

108
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,710
他想和您说话
He wants to talk to you.

109
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,960
情况有多糟
How bad is it?

110
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,630
高烧41摄氏度 且伴有器官衰竭
He's running a fever of 106 degrees, and he's in organ failure.

111
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,090
我很遗憾 兰登夫人
I'm sorry, Mrs. Landon.

112
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,090
他在等您
He's holding on for you.

113
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,300
我来了
Hey.

114
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,930
我来了
Hey.

115
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,850

117
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,190
太热了
It's so hot.

118
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,030
有冰块吗
Is there ice?

119
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,330
帮我们拿点冰块 麻烦给我们点冰块好吗
Can we have some ice? Can we have some ice, please?

120
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,620
好的 没问题
Yes, of course.

121
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,670
好了 咱们走
Okay. All right, let's go.

122
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,880
咱们去池塘
Let's go to the pool.

123
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,300
只要你需要 就爬过去
Just crawl there if you have to.

124
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,010
那个高个男孩
Long boy.

125
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,720
高个男孩怎么了
What about the long boy?

126
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,280
把路挡住了
Blocking the path.

127
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
比树还高
Higher than the trees.

128
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,040
我无路可走
No way around.

129
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,760
不 不 发生什么了
No, no, no. No. What happened?

130
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,390
到底 发生什么了
What... What happened?

131
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,520
那是
Something from...

132
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,770
很久之前的事
... A long time ago.

133
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,440
从我还是个孩子时
From when I was a kid.

134
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,120
是保罗
Something from Paul.

135
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,830
保罗
From... From Paul?

136
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,670
爸爸
Oh, Daddy!

137
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,090
爸爸救我
Daddy, help!

138
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,340
保罗发病了
Paul's got the bad!

139
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,760
爸爸 爸爸 救我
Daddy! Daddy, help!

140
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,600
保罗又发作了 爸爸
Paul's got the bad! Daddy!

141
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,690
你被感染了
You're infected.

142
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,190
他把我割开了
He cut me.

143
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,820
自从...
Ever since...

144
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,790
这些年以来...
all these years...

145
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,710
有些事已经...
something has been...

146
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,880
这是保罗弄的吗
This is from Paul?

147
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,020
我从机场候机室
I went to Boo'ya Moon...

148
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,610
去了布雅月...
from the airport lounge.

149
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,610
我又去了一次
I went again.

150
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,450
那里仍被封锁着
It's still blocked.

151
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,950
没法进入池塘
No way to the pool.

152
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,670
不 试试
No, try. Try.

153
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,710
试试 再试试
Try. Try again. Try again.

154
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,380
你和我 莉西
You and me, Lisey.

155
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,590
你和我
You and me.

156
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,060
天呐
Oh, my God.

157
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,150
我多么爱你
How I loved you.

158
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,480
我爱你 别说了
I love you. I love you. Stop.

159
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,240
别说话...
Don't talk. Just...

160
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,784
- 别说了 缓口气 - 我曾迷失在黑暗中
- Stop talking. Save your breath... - I was lost in the dark.

161
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,870
我曾...
I was...

162
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,080
迷失在黑暗中
lost in the dark.

163
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,340
你发现了我
And you found me.

164
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,170
你抱紧我
You held me.

165
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,800
不 不
No. No, no, no.

166
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,390
不 不
No. No.

167
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,018
宝贝
Oh, baby.

168
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,311
不
No.

169
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,606
- 不... - 宝贝
- No, no, no, no, no, no. - Baby.

170
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,815
不要死
Don't go.

171
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,770
宝贝
Babyluv.

172
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,364
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

173
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,650
不 别离开
No, don't go, don't go.

174
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,030
别离开
Don't go.

175
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,580
别离开
Don't go.

176
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:31,170
不 别离开
No, don't go.

177
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,220
亲爱的 我不知道该怎么活下去
I don't know how to be this way, hon.

178
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,849
我不知道要怎么想
I don't know how to think it.

179
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,970
你会知道的 你...
You would know. You...

180
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,065
你会知道
You would know.

181
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,360
你说过 心口一致
You said saying is knowing.

182
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,740
那... 我要说些什么... 难道要我说
So... So what do I... what do I say? Do I say...

183
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,370
说你过世了吗
Do I say you kicked the bucket?

184
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,330
要我说...
Do I say...

185
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,633
你已经离我而去了吗
you popped off?

186
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,760
你是不是已经撒手尘寰了
Are you eating a dirt sandwich?

187
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,271
你是不是驾鹤西去了
Are you riding the mystery train?

188
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,610
你是不是两腿一蹬
Did you bite the big one?

189
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,030
与世长辞了
Pop your clogs?

190
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,120
去世了
Peg out?

191
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:21,628
不 魂归天国呢
No. Uh... bought the farm?

192
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,630
我不知道 到底要我怎么说呢
I don't know. What do I say?

193
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,010
要怎么说 我不知道
What is it? I don't know.

194
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,550
我不知道要怎么想
I don't know how to think it.

195
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,603
没有希望
No light.

196
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,773
没有活力
No spark.

197
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,270
没有希望
No light.

198
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,240
没有活力
No spark.

199
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,740
没有希望 没有活力
No light. No spark.

200
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,540
没有希望
No light.

201
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,540
没有活力
No spark.

202
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,980
总部 二号巡逻车 位置在糖顶路
Base, this is Two out on Sugartop Road.

203
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,579
你不是值班结束了
Thought you were 10-10.

204
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,988
是的 但我想再去兰登家巡逻一次
Yeah.Thought I'd take another run past the Landon place.

205
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,533
我感觉不妙 查完就下班
I just have a funny feeling. Then I'll be 10-10.

206
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,617
收到 完毕
Copy that. Out.

207
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,068
莉西
Lisey.

208
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,730
莉西
Lisey.

209
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,990
莉西
Lisey.

210
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,120
莉西
Lisey.

211
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,840
嘿
Hey.

212
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:26,975
那是什么
What is that?

213
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,021
这是根曲棍球棒 上面有亲笔签名
Oh, it's a hockey stick. A signed hockey stick.

214
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,771
放在她丈夫的运动橱柜里
It was in her hubby's sports cupboard.

215
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,480
不过我看不出是谁签的
Can't make out the name, though.

216
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,735
我觉得那些曲棍球员肯定是文盲
I think hockey players must be illiterate.

217
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,825
那是帕特里斯・伯杰龙 
It's Patrice Bergeron, 

218
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:38,749
要是你把那球棒弄坏了
and if anything happens to it,

219
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,778
马特不会放过你
Matt's gonna kill you.

220
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,530
那我们有什么计划
So, what's the plan?

221
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,950
我擒住他 只要他倒地上
I'm gonna tackle him, and then once he's down,

222
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,839
你们就出来压住他 然后我带他去布雅月
you can pile on and then I'm gonna take him to Boo'ya...

223
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
你要带他去那个地方
You're gonna take him to that place that you went.

224
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,836
布雅月吗
Boo'ya Moon?

225
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,675
天呐
Jesus.

226
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,802
很好 我希望那混蛋被雨浇透
Good. I hope the asshole gets soaked.

227
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,430
阿曼达 你知道为何你是双界人
Amanda, do you know why you were a double?

228
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,987
还有那块带图案的编织毛毯 
And the afghan too? 

229
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:07,933
它同时出现在两界
It was in both places at once.

230
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,240
抱歉 你说什么
I'm sorry, the what?

231
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,770
好妈妈送给我们做结婚礼物的编织毛毯
The afghan that Good Ma gave us as a wedding present.

232
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,064
斯科特很喜欢
Scott loved it.

233
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,234
你嫁的男人真奇怪
You married a very strange man.

234
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,400
斯科特也是双界人
Scott was a double too.

235
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,531
他大概...八年前就是个双界人了
He was... He was a double about eight years ago.

236
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,242
他从没跟我说过双界人的事
He never said anything about doubles, at least to me.

237
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,160
他知道怎么过去 莉西
He knew how to get there, Lisey,

238
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,498
但除此之外 他知道的事也不多
but beyond that, I don't think he knew very much.

239
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,875
不 他知道池塘
No, but he knew about the pool,

240
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,942
因为过去他演讲时
because he used to talk

241
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,840
经常提到池塘
about it all the time when he gave lectures.

242
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,797
我们都喝过的池塘的水
The pool where we all went down to drink.

243
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,924
我以为那只是个比喻
I thought it was a metaphor.

244
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,384
现在你知道真相了
Now you know better.

245
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,802
你记得什么
What do you remember?

246
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,310
我记得那里景色很美...
I remember it was beautiful...

247
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,560
但又很可怕
and terrible.

248
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,310
后来我再也不想去那里
And I never want to go back there again.

249
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,859
好的 以后你就和我们待在这里
Good, then you're gonna stay here with us.

250
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,361
好的 我尽量
Okay, I'll try, I'll try.

251
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,110
那长凳上那些人呢
What about the people on the benches?

252
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,100
被裹着的那些人是谁
The ones that are wrapped up. Who are they?

253
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,577
不知道 我不想谈那些被裹着的人
I don't know. I don't want to talk about the shrouded ones.

254
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,049
但你觉得他们是谁
But what do you think they are?

255
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,703
- 我不想谈这事 - 好的
- I don't want to talk about that. - Okay.

256
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,248
好吧 抱歉
Okay, I'm sorry.

257
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,830
不必这么激动吧
Don't get your panties in a bunch...

258
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,869
如果你不谈那些事的话...
Don't get your panties in a bunch

259
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,980
我就不会激动
if you don't... talk about things that I don't...

260
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,505
别吵了 你们俩 停
Stop. Okay, both of you, stop it.

261
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:22,216
你们藏起来 进浴室里 把门关上
Just... Just go. Go hide. Go into the bathroom and shut the door.

262
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,384
得让他进来的时候 以为我是一个人
He needs to think that I'm alone when he comes.

263
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,678
我...我确实记得一件事
I do... I do remember one thing.

264
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,780
不是布雅月的事 
Not from Boo'ya Moon. 

265
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:31,180
而是在这个世界 斯科特对我说的事
From... From here. Something Scott said.

266
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:34,311
就是上次...
Just after the, uh...

267
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,132
我割伤自己
Last time that I... that I cut myself,

268
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,520
就是他死之前
you know, when I went dark,

269
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,276
我陷入疯狂的时候
before he died.

270
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,404
他讲了个故事 他说是关于莉西的故事
Something about a story. It was Lisey's story, he said.

271
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,740
他从没给你写过书 对吧
He never dedicated a book to you, did he?

272
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,744
没有 我叫他别写
No. I asked him not to.

273
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,037
为什么
Why?

274
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,415
因为他出名后 一切都变了
Because everything changed once he became famous.

275
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:57,376
我们变得世界瞩目
You know, the world came in.

276
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,504
婚姻得有私人空间 不能完全公开
You have to have a private part to a marriage, a secret part.

277
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,089
否则的话...
And if we hadn't have had that...

278
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,960
我们的婚姻肯定葬送在名利中
we never would have survived all this rich and famous shit.

279
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,390
那个故事讲了什么
What was the story about?

280
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,850
他好像没说过
I don't think he said.

281
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,730
即使他讲过 我也忘了 抱歉
If he did, I don't remember. I'm sorry.

282
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,821
你真有办法对付杜利吗
Do you really have a plan for dealing with Dooley?

283
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,400
是的
I do.

284
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,950
不过我们需要个暗号 以防我需要帮助
But we need a code word, in case I need you.

285
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,871
安全词 像是玩虐恋
Oh, a safe word. Yeah, like S&M.

286
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,915
什么 你和查理喜欢玩虐恋吗

288
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,544
刺激就是穿着袜子上床
bedroom excitement was leaving his socks on.

289
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,087
什么词 莉西
What word, Lisey?

290
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,382
"绿地"
"Greenlawn."

291
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,968
你们会听见我和他谈话...
So, you're gonna hear me talking to him...

292
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,345
等等 等等 你为什么要和他谈
Wait, wait, wait. Why are you talking to him?

293
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,931
因为我必须和他谈 我得离他很近
Because I need to talk to him. I need to be close to him.

Don't come out unless you hear "Greenlawn."

298
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,360
好吧 B计划很烂 A计划完全没逻辑
Okay, plan B sucks. And plan A makes absolutely no sense.

299
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:10,532
这计划感觉并没有仔细想清楚 莉西
Really doesn't sound like it was thoroughly thought out, Lisey.

300
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:13,535
有时候你得让故事自己书写

我要上厕所
I have to pee.

316
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,791
你就在厕所啊
Well, you're in the right place for it.

317
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,760
- 达拉不让我上 - 闭嘴
- Darla won't let me. - Shut it.

318

你是个成年女人了 你能忍住
You're a grown woman, you can hold it.

你看不见我 但我能看见你
You can't see me, but I can see you.

00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,020
你骗人
You're lying.

325
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,520
如果我骗人 那我就要死了 小姐
Well, if I'm lying, I'm dying, miss.

326
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,020
你手里是什么 是枪吗
What's that in your hand? Is that a gun?

You know, that thing you're hiding behind, that lighthouse,

332
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,520
那是你丈夫的
that was your husband's.

333
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,845
那是斯科特・兰登最大的奖品

你都不愿谈最喜欢的作者
You don't want to talk about your favorite writer.

347

"让我振作起来 斯科蒂"
"Beam me up, Scotty."

348
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,970
