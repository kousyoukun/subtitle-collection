1
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,611
暂时停职
Temporary suspension.

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,866
我的课怎么办
My classes?

3
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,493
- 你不被允许进入校园 - 什么
- You're not allowed on campus. - What?

4
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,954
他们必须给学生一个交代
They had to give something to the students,

5
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,373
尤其在与校警发生争执后
especially after the altercation with campus police.

6
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,710
拉森让他们为一个该死的捐赠者活动清理广场
Larson asked them to clear the quad for a fucking donor event.

7
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,994
因为那个大嘴巴
Because of that windbag,

8
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:47,047
我才和校警有过结的
I'm getting lumped in with campus police?

9
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,677
这太不公平了 都是因为他 你查清楚了吗
That's completely unfair. That's on him. Did you make that clear?

10
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,345
- 你帮我说话了吗 - 你没有...
- Did you defend me? - You don't...

11
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,057
你知道我都经历了些什么吗
Do you know what I've been dealing with?

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,059
学生来找我 和我哭诉...
Students coming and crying and...

13
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,479
这不是我作为主任想看到的
This isn't what I wanna be dealing with as chair.

14
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,606
我该怎么做呢
What should I do?

15
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,733
你需要做一个正式的道歉
You're going to need to formally apologize.

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,942
抱歉 我...
I'm so sorry. I...

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,527
不 不是对我说 笨蛋
No, not to me, dumbass!

18
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,237
我的意思是没错 要对我说
I mean yes, to me,

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,782
但他们正在组织一个纪律听证会
but they're putting together a disciplinary hearing,

20
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,242
你必须作出能让所有学生都接受的道歉
and you have to write an apology that can be disseminated.

21
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,704
天啊 什么
Jesus. What is...

22
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,458
是珠珠的学校 是在逗我呢吧 等我会
It's Ju Ju's school. You gotta be kidding me. Hold on.

23
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,626
你好
Hello.

24
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,710
是的 是我
Yes, this is she.

25
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,923
等会 打人还是咬人
Wait, hit or bit?

26
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:33,923
{\an8}英文系主任 第一季 第04集

你们两个都被禁足了
You're both suspended.

28
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,141
我要去上班了 你们必须写检讨书
I'm going to work, and you are going to write letters.

29
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,228
珠珠 你需要向亚丁道歉
Ju Ju, you will apologize to Adin.

30
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,023
比尔 你需要向所有人道歉
Bill, you will apologize... to everyone.

31
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,734
那我整晚都得呆在这里了
Mmm. I'm gonna be here all night.

32
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,195
下节课 每个人都需要完成
For next time, everyone needs to come

33
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:57,784
宽恕者的传说

英国诗人乔叟所著的《坎特伯雷故事集》中的一个故事
讲述了贪婪与死亡

35
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,703
不能原谅偷懒者
No pardons for slackers.

36
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,998
嗨
Oh hi.

37
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,544
我们之前提过的那件事我搞定了
I was able to do that thing we talked about.

38
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,379
我不认为你真的...
I didn't think you were really...

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,422
我当时是在开玩笑
I was joking.

40
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,259
我认为你假装在开玩笑 但实际上你是认真的
I thought you were pretending to joke but were actually serious.

41
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,761
幸好我没有开玩笑说要杀了他
Good thing I didn't joke we should kill him.

42
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,891
- 好吧 - 所以你找到他了吗
- All right. - So you tracked him down?

43
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,213
不太确定 但是我
Not exactly. But I was able

44
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:25,186
侵入了教授评价网站
to hack into the Rate My Professor website.

45
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,439
侵入 不 
Hack? No, I can't even be tangentially connected

46
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,193
我不能与任何不正当或违法的行为有关联
to anything that might seem improper conduct or illegal.

47
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,778
- 但是你想知道它是谁吗 - 当然
- But you wanna know who it is? - Yes.

48
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,862
好了
Okay.

49
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,782
两次的邮件都从人文图书馆发出

52
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,705

No, EatMeChaucer@gmail.Com.

53
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,064
如果他再次发邮件 
If he posts again, and, say, 

54
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,876
我们也在图书馆的话...
we were at the library...

55
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,004
我的意思是 你就能找出那个人
Yeah. I mean, you'd have to recognize the guy.

56
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,964
那应该不会太难
That shouldn't be too hard.

57
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,425
如果抓住他的话 你想做什么
What are you gonna do if you catch him?

58
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,969
"毁灭他" 琼开玩笑地说
"Destroy him," Joan said jokingly,

59
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,514
当这刚好成为她计划做的事时
when that's exactly what she was planning to do.

60
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,771
嗨 我是来自彭布罗克校报的夏洛特・罗
Hi, I'm Charlotte Lo from The Pembroke Daily.

- I left you a few messages. - Right. Hi.

62
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,944
我不想评论整件事 好吗
Uh, I... I don't wanna comment on the whole thing, okay?

63
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,156
你站哪边呢 你会参加明天的抗议吗
Well, where do you stand? Are you joining the protest tomorrow?

64
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,618
我想人们会很乐意听到你的观点
I think people would appreciate hearing your point of view.

65
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,118
抱歉
Sorry.

66
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,372
是什么让你选择成为比尔・多布森的助教
What made you pursue Bill Dobson as a mentor in the first place?

67
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,750
我没法回答你 好吗
I... I can't answer, okay?

68
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,252
我们系的主任
The chair of my department gave me an earful

69
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,296
让我们不要和任何人谈论此事
about not talking to anyone about this.

70
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,643
- 天啊 - 她不做饭
- Jesus. - She doesn't cook.

71
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,143
{\an8}现成午饭

72
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,939
- 我可以给你做些鸡蛋 - 我不吃鸡蛋
- I guess I'm making you some eggs, then. - I don't eat eggs.

73
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,776
你不喜欢吃鸡蛋 还是你从未尝试过
Because you don't like 'em, or you never tried 'em?

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
两个都有
Both.

75
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,080
如果你愿意尝一口 我就给你一美元
I'll give you a dollar if you try a bite.

76
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,750
说一样你能用一美元买到的东西吧
Name one thing you can buy with a dollar.

77
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,377
葡萄干
Raisins?

78
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,256

Come in.

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,258
金教授 你有时间吗
Uh, Professor Kim, you got a sec?

80
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,260
当然 请进 达斯汀
Sure thing. Come in, Dustin.

81
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,053
你好 卡普里
Oh, hi, Capri.

82
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:23,554
请坐
Take a seat.

83
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,554
我们不坐了
We're okay.

84
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:25,974
怎么了
What's up?

85
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,445
政治科学系刚刚拒绝了他们系里
Poli Sci just denied tenure

86
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:29,769
唯一的有色人种的终身任职
to the only person of color in their department.

87
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,437
我们很担心麦凯教授
We're worried about Professor McKay.

88
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,689
他们是保守的老混蛋
They're conservative assholes.

89
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,024
黑人职员被用不同的标准来对待
Black faculty are held to different standards.

90
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:35,822
我知道 
I know. 

91
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,610
他们的研究根本不被认真对待
Their research isn't considered rigorous.

92
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,780
他们被认定为是不守规矩的 不合群的
They're assumed to be more disorganized, less collegial.

93
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,648
- 我知道 - 他们很少被邀请到
- I know. - They get invited less often

94
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,534
同事家里吃饭
to their colleagues' houses for dinner.

95
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,662
我知道
I know.

96
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,373
相信我 我真的知道
Trust me, I know.

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,113
这是三百二十个学生联合签名的信
This is a letter signed by 320 students

98
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:55,295
关于麦凯教授所受到的影响
about the impact Professor McKay has had.

99
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,381
也关于她支持有色人种学生的做法
The way she's supported students of color.

100
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,062
如果她的终身教职被拒绝了 
If she is denied tenure, 

101
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:04,429
我们会采取行动的
we plan to take action.

102
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,935
你看起来不太高兴啊
Don't you look dashing.

103
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,187
我瘦了一些 所以我需要把衣服改小一点
I lost a little weight, so I had this taken in,

104
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,023
但你看看他们都做了什么
but look what they did to the sleeves.

105
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,900
我是说 这袖子不是钟形的 这是椭圆形的
I mean, this isn't bell-shaped, this is oblong.

106
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,235
这是硕士袍
This is a master's gown.

107
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,987
所有人都是知道你有博士学位
Everyone knows you have a doctorate.

108
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,286
要不要我问问劳里
Would you like me to see if Laurie

109
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:24,782
是否能考虑给你订件新的吗
can look into ordering you a new one?

110
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,077
- 那会花掉我多少钱呢 - 系里出钱
- How much is that gonna run me? - Oh, on the house.

111
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,203
真的吗
Really?

112
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,955
- 我们之间的秘密 - 谢谢你 
- Our secret. - Well, thanks, kiddo.

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,500
你给雅兹写的终身教职函
Um, your tenure letter for Yaz

114
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,919
会包含她教学的信息 对吧
is going to include material on her teaching, right?

115
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,145
为什么不包括呢 
Why wouldn't it? 

116
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:39,517
我认为你应该重点突出
I think it's important that you

117
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:41,632
她革新性的教授方法
highlight how innovative her pedagogy is.

118
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,884
翻转课堂
The flipped classroom...

119
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,231
我相信这将作为一个案例
Well, I believe a specimen of that

120
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:46,596
展现在当今的研讨会上
will be on display in today's seminar.

121
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,681
所以你能不能提一下它
Could you maybe include a mention of it?

122
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,685
听着 她现在太有人气了
Look, she is hot shit right now.

123
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,749
她的推特账号上有八千多的关注者
She has over 8,000 followers on Twitter.

124
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,731
这比我们加起来都要多
That's more than all of us put together.

125
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,484
你知道谁会根据自己的跟随者来判断自己吗
You know who judged himself by the number of his followers?

126
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,980
吉姆・琼斯  大卫・考雷什 
Jim Jones. David Koresh. 

127
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,570
雅兹不是狂热宗教的领袖 埃利奥特
Yaz isn't a cult leader, Elliot.

128
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,570
{\an8}美国人民圣殿教的创始人和领袖
美国大卫教派教主

129
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,199
耶稣只有十二个跟随者 我想他只是个失败者
Jesus only had 12 followers. I suppose that makes him a loser.

130
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,231
因为她 
Because of her, 

131
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:13,873
我们的学生都对一百五十年前创作的文学作品
our students are excited

132
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,126
感到热血沸腾了
about literature that was written 150 years ago.

133
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,461
我知道在你人气火爆的时候
I know in your heyday...

134
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,671
你怎么知道现在不是我人气火爆的时候呢
How do you know right now is not my heyday?

135
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,513
听着 我不想摆架子
Look, I don't want to pull rank here,

136
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,598
但是作为主任 我需要你这么做
but as the chair, I need you to do this.

137

你肯定已经进入角色了
You sure settled into that role.

138

不是作为你的上司这么讲话

为了衔接好比尔中断的地方

比尔可不会这么想 
Bill's not gonna see it that way. 

220

行啦 让我来吧

我还以为你睡着了
I thought you were asleep.

246
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,722
我装睡的
I was tricking you.

247
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,683
你能把故事讲完吗
Can you finish the story?

248
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,314
你知道吗 
You know what it is? 

249
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,484
她不是在教学生 而是在和他们一起玩
She doesn't wanna teach them. She wants to hang out with them.

250
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,364
虽然她在各大顶级刊物上发表文章 但是
Though she's publishing in all the highest venues, but...

他们曾驳回了你的终身任职申请 
They turned you down for tenure, 

253
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,118
而你是那时最好的教授
and you were the best we had.

254
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,700
那时候我忙着照顾三个孩子
Because I was expected to write a book

255
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,705
还要写书
when I was busy raising three kids.

256
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,873
他们本可以让你休息一段时间
They should've stopped your tenure clock.

257
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,875
我本应该做更多争取
I should've put more pressure on them.

258
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,794
- 我很抱歉 - 都过去啦
- I'm sorry. - Shoulda, woulda.

259
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,379
总得有人在家做饭
Someone had to make dinner.

260
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,880
也对
Yeah.

我不要穿尿布
I'm not wearing diapers.

263
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,974
这没什么的 只是年龄需要
This doesn't spell doom, old man.

"我曾像巨人似的跨越这狭隘的世界"
I used to bestride the narrow world like a Colossus.

现在你要穿着纸尿裤
Well, now you're going to bestride it

266
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:13,858
跨越这狭隘的世界了
in Tranquility Briefs.

267
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,486
老天爷啊
Oh God.

268
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:08,412
国王和王后的梦在何处"回向"
Where the dreams of kings and queens "Echoo"?

269
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,581
- 回响 - 回响

00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,755
- 他是在取笑谁 - 富人
- And whom was he making fun of? - Rich people.

273
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,842
- 什么样的富人 - 来自欧洲的
- What kind of rich people? - Ones from Europe.

274
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,513
你知道什么叫讽刺吗
Do you know what it means to lampoon somebody?

275
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,809
波萨达是在讽刺墨西哥总统波费里奥・迪亚斯
Posada was making fun of Mexican leader Porfirio Díaz

276
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,353
因为虽然迪亚斯完成了墨西哥的现代化改革
because even though Díaz modernized Mexico,

277
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,064
但是他的改革只让统治阶级获益
his reforms really only benefited the ruling class.

278
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,315
我也想讽刺你
I wanna lampoon you.

279
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,276
不 你不想
I don't think so.

280
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,279
我是比尔 我超无趣
My name's Bill, and I'm so boring.

281
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,749
珠珠 你是负责介绍墨西哥亡灵节的文化大使
Ju Ju, you're the cultural ambassador of Dia de los Muertos.

282
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,335
不好好准备你的报告 你会后悔的
If we don't work on your presentation, you're gonna be sorry.

283
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,087
我要休息
When's recess?

284
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,363
是我
It's me.

285
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,115
我知道
Yeah, I know.

286
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,800
我已经连上无线网络了
Um, okay, so I'm all set up on the Wi-Fi.

287
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,079
万事俱备 只等他发帖
Now we just, um, wait for a post.

288
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,880
你在读乔叟
You're reading Chaucer?

289
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,133
是啊 虽然我完全像在读外语
Yeah. It's like reading a different language, though, you know.

290
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,760
你很快就会习惯的
You'll be surprised how fast you get used to it.

291
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,597
只要你放空自己 放弃理解
If you can just let go and stop trying to understand...

292
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,266
和我写代码的时候一样
Yeah, that's how code was for me.

293
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,019
放任它们洗刷我的大脑
I just let it go, let it wash over me...

294
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,019
- 来了 - 这么快
- It's him. - Already?

295
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,855
- 就是他 - 对
- It's him? - Yeah.

296
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,273
他在哪
Where is he?

297
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,109
"这个丑八怪让我想自杀"
"This hag makes me wanna kill myself."

298
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,612
很好 你的死期已到
Good. Now it'll look like a suicide.

299
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,865
让我查下IP地址
Let me, uh, check the IP address.

300
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,076
找到了 就是他 很好
He's here. He's here. Okay.

301
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,289
接下来怎么...办
All right, what should we... do?

302
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,582
好吧
Oh, okay.

303
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,594
什么 不
What? No.

304
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,400
我复印不了资料
Well, I can't make copies,

305
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,810
还把我的车解锁了
but I think I just unlocked my car.

306
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,189
- 需要帮忙吗 - 欢迎至极
- You want a hand? - Be my guest.

307
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,735
- 这机器有自己的想法 - 别提了
- She's got a mind of her own. - Mmm. Don't remind me.

308
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,818
行了
Okay.

309
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,492
好极了 谢谢
Brilliant. Thank you.

310
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,576
不用
Yeah.

311
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,824
你知道梅尔维尔去世的时候 
You know when Melville died, 

312
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:56,872
《纽约时报》只发表了一条短短的死亡通告吗
the Times just published a tiny death notice?

313
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,333
他们还把《白鲸记》拼错了
They actually misspelled the title of Moby-Dick.

314
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,377
- 拼成了mobie - ie结尾
- m-o-b-I-e. - I-e.

315
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,588
- 这让我很难过 - 我也是
- It upsets me. - Well, that makes two of us.

316
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,258
- 谢谢 - 没事
- Thanks. - Yeah.

317
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,723
嘿 你忘了拿这个...
Oh, hey, you forgot your, uh...

318
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,358
这是一个水气球
This is a water balloon.

319
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,652
为了探究空气阻力和物理
In order to explore air resistance and physics,

320
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,320
你得接住它
what you do is you catch it.

321
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,699
接得好 太棒了 真是厉害...
Oh, good catch! That was perfect! That was so awes...

322
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,451
你这个小...
You li...

323
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,285
你逼我的
That's it!

324
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,872
你要完蛋了
You're a goner.

325
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,919
我来了 我来抓你了
I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!

326
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,381
你要去哪
Hey, where are you going?

327
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,091
珠珠 来 回来
Ju Ju, come on, come back.

328
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,343
我们去给妈妈一个惊喜吧
Let's go surprise Mommy!

329
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,346
我不能 我不可以进入校园范围内
I can't. I'm not allowed to be on campus.

330
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,228
干嘛啊
What the fuck?

331
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,772
新规 图书馆内禁止睡觉
No sleeping in the library. It's a new rule.

332
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,898
好吧
Oh okay.

333
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,192
嘿 计划是什么
Hey. So, what's the plan?

334
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,112
什么...
Wha...

335
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,197
喂
Hey.

336
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,038
喂 叫你呢
Hey, you!

337
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,538
就是他吗
Is that him?

338
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,709
等等 该死
Wait! Goddamn it.

339
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,087
等等我 等等
Wait. Wait!

340
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,464
快点
Come on!

341
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,506
嘿
Hey!

342
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,972
- 史蒂夫 - 汉布林教授
- Steve. - Professor Hambling?

343
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,558
你给我听好了
Now you listen to me.

344
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,311
你不喜欢我没关系
I may not be your cup of tea,

345
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,605
但是《坎特伯雷故事集》是一部天才之作
but The Canterbury Tales is a work of genius.

346
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,191
沾花惹草的丈夫 水性杨花的家庭主妇
Philandering husbands, horny housewives,

347
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,943
放屁 拉屎 阴毛
farting, shitting, pubic hair.

348
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,348
可怜的傻子向女人求吻
Some poor schmuck asked a woman for a kiss

349
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:54,615
最后走了她的后门
and ends up making out with her butthole.

350
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,658
我也希望你有那么好运
That's a fate I'm wishing for you.

351
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,619
- 差不多得了 - 你最好把那小嘴撅起来
- Okay, okay. - So, you know, pucker up.

352
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,600
你听清楚她说的话了吗 
You hear what she's saying? 

353
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,914
你可以不喜欢我
You don't have to like me.

354
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,543
但是六百多年的文学批评
But Chaucer has survived

355
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:06,251
都没能把乔叟打倒
more than 600 years of literary criticism.

356
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,172
要是你这都搞不懂乔叟有多牛逼
And if you can't figure out that he's a badass,

357
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,883
那请你别来上我的课了
then just stay the fuck out of my classroom.

358
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,260
帅呆了
Dope City!

359
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,474
你下学期教什么
What are you teaching next semester?

360
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,560
乔叟
Chaucer.

361
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:29,796
{\an8}David Duchovny
特聘讲师

362
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,319
我会让他撤回的
I'll ask him to pull back.

363
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,448
这只是草稿
It's just a draft.

364
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,784
他复印的是信头纸
He was making photocopies on letterhead.

365
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,431
显然他是要寄出去的 
Pretty sure he's ready to send it. 

366
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:41,995
我绝对不会让他这么做
I promise I won't let him.

367
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,332
怎么了
What?

368
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,876
你有终身教职 我没有
You have tenure, I don't.

369
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,962
现在你还是系主任 我...
Now you're the chair too. I...

370
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,163
我也不知道 就是
I don't know, I just, I'm not

371
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,507
我不知道哪些话该说 哪些不该说
sure what's okay to say and what's not okay.

372
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,030
雅兹 如果我之前没有说清楚
Yaz, if I haven't made it clear

373
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:57,261
我希望你畅所欲言 那么...
that I want you to speak your mind, then...

374
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,808
那我...这是我的严重失误
Then I... I consider that a serious failure on my part.

375
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,226
那让我很难受
I mean, that kills me.

376
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,770
好吧
Okay.

377
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,401
这是什么意思
What are you doing?

378
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,452
这和你的任务有哪门子关系
How does this align with your mission?

379
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,321
我还以为不会再有这些破事了
I thought we moved beyond this bullshit.

380
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,132
我对大卫・杜楚尼这件事让步 
I am giving them David Duchovny, 

381
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,366
他们就会对你的事让步
so they will give me you.

382
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,577
你不该帮大卫・杜楚尼
You shouldn't be pimping for David Duchovny.

383
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,427
我知道... 
I know... 

384
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,537
也不该由我站出来...
I shouldn't be asked to stand out...

385
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,621
我在努力了
I am trying.

386
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,709
我丝毫没有接管了英文系的感觉
I don't feel like I inherited an English Department.

387
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,170
我觉得有人把一个定时炸弹扔给了我
I feel like someone handed me a ticking time bomb

388
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,406
因为他们想要确保 炸弹爆炸时
because they wanted to make sure a woman

389
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,300
责任在一个女人身上
was holding it when it explodes.

390
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,925
比尔和我差不多是同一时间开始在这里教书的
Bill and I started teaching here around the same time.

391
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,760
每次埃利奥特和我们碰上
Whenever Elliot would bump into us,

392
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,347
他都会拍拍比尔的背 邀请他去家里吃晚饭
he would clap Bill on the back and invite him over for dinner,

393
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,516
就像当我不存在一样
and I was like, "Um, hello?"

394
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:49,605
底线是 他手中依然有很多制度权力
The bottom line is, he still has a lot of institutional power.

395
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,774
他没有安全感 是因为没人上他的课了
He's insecure because no one takes his classes anymore.

396
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,942
没错
Yeah.

397
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,236
不 我明白你为什么同情他
No, I see why you feel sorry for him.

398
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,990
他统治这个行业的时间只有过去四十年而已
He only got to rule the profession for the last 40 years.

399
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,952
雅兹...
Yaz...

400
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,998
珠珠
Ju Ju!

401
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,417
我是认真的
I'm serious.

402
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,628
珠珠
Ju Ju?

403
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,505
等等 这已经属于校园范畴了 我不能进去
Wait. That is technically campus. I cannot be there.

404
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,925
不 珠珠 求你了
No, Ju Ju, please.

405
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
停下
Stop!

406
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,653
我不能来这里 我不能进来学校
I can't be here! I can't be on campus!

407
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,862
喂 多布森
Hey, Dobson.

408
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,740
别认输啊
Don't back down.

409
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,368
美国有言论自由
