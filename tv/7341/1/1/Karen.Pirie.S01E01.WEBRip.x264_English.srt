167
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,880
<i>BANGING So I locked him out on the balcony.</i>

168
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,200
<i>Right. We're coming in now, Tracey.</i>

169
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,280
<i>Why don't me and you
have a chat in here?</i>

170
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,040

need you to come inside, please.</i>

172
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,080

We've talked about this.</i>

173
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,680
<i>I'm not gonna help you put him away.</i>

174
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
<i>You will be an accessory
to his crimes, Tracey.</i>

175
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
<i>I didn't know what he was doing.
You'll have to prove that in court.</i>

176
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>Do you really want to go through
all of that for him?</i>

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,160
<i>Ah...</i>

178
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,920
<i>Right. Why don't...
we go down to the station, Tracey?</i>

179
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,160
<i>Don't!
Mind your step.</i>

180
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,520

No, they didn't!</i>

00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,760
<i>And why?</i>

331
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,560
<i>'Call an ambulance, she's dying!'</i>

332
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,080
<i>You three, come over here
where I can see you!</i>

333
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,000
<i>Still warm...</i>

334
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,640
<i>I'm a medical student. Can I help?</i>

335
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,640
<i>You say you found her?</i>

336
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,440
<i>On our way home.
Why did you leave?</i>

337
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,680
<i>To find a phone.</i>

338
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,480
<i>But you're a medic.
Why didn't you stay with her?</i>

339
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,680
<i>Why didn't one of the others go?</i>

340
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,880
<i>SIRENS</i>

341
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,120
<i>I've tried to resuscitate,
but I think she's gone.</i>

342
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,280
<i>You got an ID?</i>

343
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,240
<i>Rosie Duff... Sir.</i>

344
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,440
<i>Two of them were at the scene...</i>

345
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,200
<i>one of them ran out
right in front of my car.</i>

346
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,240
<i>Thanks, Jimmy.</i>

347
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,640
<i>They said they found her like this.</i>

348
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,200
<i>The one that left
said he was running for help.</i>

349
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,360
<i>Detain them, Jimmy.</i>

350
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,160
<i>I've never seen anything like...</i>

351
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,880
<i>Keep it together, Jan, eh?
For her.</i>

352
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,720
<i>She was strangled.</i>

353
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,880
<i>Ligatures?</i>

354
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,680
<i>By hand.
Is that how she died?</i>

355
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,920
<i>The autopsy concluded that she was
throttled until she was unconscious,</i>

356
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,640
<i>but it was the stomach wound
that killed her.</i>

357
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,040
<i>She bled to death?</i>

358
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,440
<i>Would have taken 20 minutes,
maybe more.</i>

359
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
<i>She was just... lying there...</i>

360
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,280
<i>Jesus. Why do that? Cut across
the stomach? Such a slow death.</i>

361
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,720
<i>And why leave her in the cathedral?</i>

362
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,120
<i>I suppose a graveyard
makes some sense.</i>

363
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,720
<i>If you want to get rid of a body,
you bury it,</i>

364
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,200
<i>dump it in the sea, burn it,</i>

365
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,520
<i>you don't leave it in the middle
of a tourist attraction,</i>

366
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,440
<i>right in the middle of summer.
Unless you want someone to find it.</i>

367
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,440
<i>You think that has some
significance? A religious aspect?</i>

368
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,920
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

369
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,640
<i>What was the weapon?</i>

370
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,040
<i>They think it was a kitchen knife.
They didn't find it?</i>

371
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
<i>No. Never.</i>

372
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,200
<i>There was another thing -
when they analysed Rosie's clothing,</i>

373
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,560
<i>they found fibres
from the interior carpet of a car.</i>

374
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,240
<i>They moved the body.</i>

375
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,240
<i>There's a second crime scene.
But we don't know where.</i>

376
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,760
<i>OK. So, she's choked unconscious,</i>

377
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,480
<i>moved by car,
laid out in the graveyard</i>

378
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,080
<i>and cut across the stomach...</i>

379
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,320
<i>but there's no sign of a murder
weapon when the police arrive.</i>

380
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,640
<i>Or a vehicle.</i>

381
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,640
<i>Can I have your names, please?</i>

382
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,760
<i>Alex Gilbey.</i>

383
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,360
<i>He's Tom Mackie.
And you?</i>

384
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,560
<i>Sigmund Malkiewicz.
I just wanna go home.</i>

385
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,160
<i>They need to speak to us, Weird,
we're witnesses.</i>

386
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
<i>Alex Gilbey, Tom Mackie,
Sigmund Malkiewicz,</i>

00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,800

392
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,240
<i>No, you don't understand.
We found her.</i>

393
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,360
<i>We need to take you to the station
and question you.</i>

394
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,000
<i>You said "detain". You said de...</i>

395
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
<i>Wait, what are you doing?</i>

396
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,800
<i>Don't make this harder

<i>What are you doing? Stop it!</i>

401
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,640
<i>Listen. We didn't see her tonight.</i>

402
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,080
<i>We don't know her. OK?</i>

403
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
<i>Didn't see her. Don't know her.</i>

404
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,720
<i>Could you hear me, Weird?</i>

405
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,560
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

406

<i>So, shall we start at the beginning?</i>

442
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,960
<i>We were just walking home

443

<i>That's not the beginning, though,
is it?</i>

444
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,560
<i>We watched the match.</i>

445
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,520
<i>Where?
The...</i>

446
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
<i>The Lammas pub.</i>

447
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,680
<i>Which is where Rosie worked.
Yeah... I guess so.</i>

448
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,640
<i>And did you see her there?</i>

449
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,720
<i>It was really busy.
Is that a yes or a no?</i>

450
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,800
<i>Just from afar.</i>

451
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,360
<i>Did your friends?</i>

452
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,040
<i>They might have.
Have you ever spoken to her?</i>

453
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,040
<i>I've ordered drinks from her.
So, you knew her?</i>

454
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,120
<i>No...</i>

455
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,560
<i>What time did you leave the Lammas?</i>

456
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,440
<i>Er, 10:30... 11:00-ish.</i>

457
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,080
<i>'And where did you go?'</i>

458
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,200
<i>'To a party.'
'Whose party?'</i>

459
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,040
<i>Some, erm... Some fourth years.</i>

460
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,080
<i>And where was this party?</i>

461
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,520
<i>I...</i>

462
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,040
<i>I don't know.
What time did you get to the party?</i>

463
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,040
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

464
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,120
<i>How long did you stay at the party?
Until we walked home.</i>

465
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,320
<i>Which was at what time?</i>

466
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,760
<i>BUZZING</i>

467
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,920
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

468
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,400
<i>Are you on something, Tom?
No.</i>

469
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,280
<i>We'll be testing you,
so you might want to be honest.</i>

470
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,400
<i>Was this party at Scooniehill Lane?</i>

471
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,160
<i>At this address?</i>

472
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,480
<i>He seems to think it happened
at the party.</i>

473
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,880
<i>It is a big house. It's an
abandoned manor, old, dilapidated...</i>

474
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,600
<i>So plenty of places
to sneak away to...</i>

475
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,480
<i>To have sex, do drugs.
Or, you know, kill someone.</i>

476
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,720
<i>I think that, at the pub,
you invited her to the party.</i>

477
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,360
<i>You wrote the address down here
for her.</i>

478
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,240
<i>She turned up,
and something went very, very wrong.</i>

479
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,680
<i>No! She never came.
So you did invite her?</i>

480
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,800
<i>But she didn't turn up.</i>

481
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,840
<i>That doesn't feel very likely, Ziggy.</i>

482
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,040
<i>I mean, you invited this girl
to a party,</i>

483
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,520
<i>and then we find your friends
with her body,</i>

484
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,600
<i>and you trying to flee the scene,
covered in blood.</i>

485
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
<i>No, I was... I was getting help.</i>

486
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,520
<i>And then you hide evidence.</i>

487
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,240
<i>I didn't... It...</i>

488
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,840
<i>It fell out of her pocket
when I was helping her,</i>

489
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,200
<i>I didn't realise
I still had it on me.</i>

490
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,160
<i>So you dropped it and obscured it.
Because I thought it would look bad!</i>

491
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,440
<i>This looks very bad, Ziggy.</i>

492
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,920
<i>And your story is, you invite her
to the party, she doesn't turn up,</i>

493
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,520
<i>and you just happen to stumble
across her on the way home.</i>

494
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,760
<i>Accept the cathedral isn't
on your way home, Ziggy, is it?</i>

495
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,520
<i>It adds a good ten minutes
to your journey.</i>

496
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,640
<i>Sometimes we just walk that way!
I don't know...</i>

497
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,200
<i>You do know, Ziggy.</i>

498
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,240
<i>You took her there. Either dead
or alive, you took her there.</i>

499
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,880
<i>No!
Something happened at that party.</i>

500
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,440
<i>Someone else did this.</i>

501
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,000
<i>Were you sleeping with her?
No!</i>

502
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,640
<i>Did you want to?
No.</i>

503
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
<i>Maybe she resisted?
And you didn't like that. No!</i>

504
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,520
<i>Maybe it was one of your friends. No.</i>

505
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,960
<i>Maybe they did this,
and you helped cover it up. No!</i>

506
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,920
<i>Why did you kill her, Ziggy?
Why did you strangle her?</i>

507
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,520
<i>I didn't.
One of you did. No!</i>

508
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,320
<i>Or did you rape her?
Didn't want her to tell anyone?</i>

509
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,880
<i>No!
Maybe you argued, huh?</i>

510
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,520
<i>Your hands went up to her neck...
No, I swear!</i>

511
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,600
<i>What did she do to make you so mad,
Ziggy?</i>

512
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,720
<i>Nothing!
She must have wound you up somehow.</i>

513
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,120
<i>No!</i>

514
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,480
<i>I didn't know her, I didn't see her.</i>

515
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
<i>I didn't kill her.</i>

516
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,280
<i>He's missing two things - murder
weapon and a second crime scene.</i>

517
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,320
<i>Is there any witness accounts
that place Rosie at the party?</i>

518
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,200
<i>They interviewed everyone
and nobody saw her.</i>

519
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,360
<i>But they must have searched it
top to bottom.</i>

520
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
<i>Yeah, they did,
and they didn't find anything.</i>

521
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,720
<i>Not a single hair, a drop of blood,
or any sign of a murder weapon.</i>

522
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,400
<i>Can we go?
It's since been demolished.</i>

523
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,000
<i>Brilliant. Right...</i>

524
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,520
<i>So, the last place she was seen
was...?</i>

525
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,720
<i>CCTV on the high street at midnight.</i>

526
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,880
<i>See? She ducks.
Doesn't want to be seen.</i>

527
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,640
<i>Iona, her friend, said that
she left the pub to meet someone.</i>

528
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,080
<i>One of these students?</i>

529
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,720
<i>Rosie didn't tell her.
She didn't tell anyone.</i>

530
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,440
<i>Why?</i>

531
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,560
<i>Probably her brothers.
Colin and Brian Duff.</i>

532
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,600
<i>Both extremely protective.
And they were there that night?</i>

533
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,280
<i>Mm. Both tough bastards - criminal
records, drunk driving, assault.</i>

534
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,400
<i>Did she have sex?</i>

535
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,160
<i>There's signs in the postmortem.
But no semen.</i>

536
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,920
<i>So, condom, or didn't finish.
Or she could have been interrupted.</i>

537
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,200
<i>Signs of assault? Rape?
Nothing definitive.</i>

538
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,680
<i>It could have just been rough sex.</i>

539
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,240
<i>But, look, this is interesting.</i>

540
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,000
<i>She was cut right across
the abdomen.</i>

541
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,760
<i>No, look below. She has a caesarean
scar. Across her lower stomach.</i>

542
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,040
<i>It's barely mentioned
in the reports.</i>

543
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,440
<i>Rosie had a baby?</i>

544
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,080
<i>But there's no mention of when
it happened, what happened to it,</i>

545
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,520
<i>or who the father was.</i>

546
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,000
<i>Surely an ex would be
the first place you'd look.</i>

547
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,720
<i>Why didn't they investigate it?
I don't know.</i>

548
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,520
<i>But maybe the brothers
can shine a light.</i>

549
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,280
<i>So, get across
the forensics tonight.</i>

550
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,600
<i>Tonight?</i>

551
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,640
<i>Yeah. Well, we'll go
and see the Duffs tomorrow.</i>

552
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
<i>Right. OK.</i>

553
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,680
<i>You got somewhere to be?</i>

554
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,160
<i>Just a HIIT class.</i>

555
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,320
<i>Right. Well, I could, er... I could
put one box on one side of the room</i>

556
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,920
<i>and on the other. And you could
run between them, if you like?</i>

557
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,440
<i>And try and beat your time?
I can play some bleeps, if you like?</i>

558
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,080
<i>OK, OK. Yeah, cos you said you
were really good at the bleep test.</i>

559
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,160
<i>Yeah, I'll do my homework.</i>

560
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,400
<i>Was one of the first things
that you said to me, actually.</i>

561
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,600
<i>Hey.
Hey.</i>

562
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,160
<i>How's it going?</i>

563
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,200
<i>All right.</i>

564
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,040
<i>You not going to text me back, then?</i>

565
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,640
<i>I'm sorry, KP. I'm really sorry.</i>

566
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,000
<i>I keep writing things,
then deleting them.</i>

567
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,240
<i>I've been trying to find
the right words.</i>

568
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,000
<i>Well, heh... Anything would've
been better than nothing.</i>

569
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,520
<i>I know.</i>

570
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,200
<i>We've known each other too long
to be falling out over a job.</i>

571
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,080
<i>I-I-I get it now.
It should be you on this job.</i>

572
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,920
<i>It's right that it's you.
What do you mean?</i>

573
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,400
<i>I-I spoke to Lees about it
and he explained everything.</i>

574
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
<i>Explained what?</i>

575
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,320
<i>Just what, you know, with the...
the podcast.</i>

576
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,360
<i>All the accusations she's making out
against the police</i>

577
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,800
<i>about gender violence and, you know,</i>

578
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,240
<i>it's appropriate that they got...
Sorry. Wait....</i>

579
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,840
<i>Are you saying they put me on this
because I'm a woman?</i>

580
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,120
<i>Not just that.</i>

581
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,280
<i>And that you've
all been talking about it,</i>

582
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,520
<i>saying that a female has to be
on this because it'll look better?</i>

583
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,880
<i>It's not a bad thing, Karen.</i>

584
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,960
<i>There's a bunch of mediocre
white men in the building</i>

585
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,880
<i>that get promoted all the time,</i>

586
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,440
<i>who cares why we move up,
as long as we're moving up?</i>

587
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,000
<i>I care, Phil. Because I don't want
to walk around this office</i>

588
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
<i>with men thinking that I'm a fraud
with a pair of tits.</i>

589
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,720
<i>No-one thinks that, Karen!</i>

590
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,840
<i>Jesus! Everyone knows
you're a good detective.</i>

591
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,000
<i>And a walking, talking PR win
for the service.</i>

592
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,200
<i>I'm not the enemy here, Karen. No...</i>

593
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,720
<i>but you still agree with them.</i>

594
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,560
<i>What the files won't tell you,
but Facebook will,</i>

595
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,360
<i>is that PC Janice Hogg
married Colin Duff in 2001.</i>

596
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,120
<i>PC Hogg, as in,
from this investigation?</i>

597
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,600
<i>The one that found Rosie.
And Rosie's brother?</i>

598
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,720
<i>Small towns are small towns.</i>

599
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,200
<i>And murder cases are very sexy.</i>

600
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,440
<i>They moved into the old Duff
family home after Rosie's dad died.</i>

601
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,480
<i>Hello. Janice.</i>

602
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,240
<i>Oh, no...</i>

603
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,640
<i>What have my boys done now?</i>

604
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,480
<i>It's, er...
It isn't about your boys, Archie.</i>

605
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
<i>May we come in?</i>

606
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,880
<i>Aye. Aye, of course. Come in.</i>

607
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,200
<i>Tea or coffee?
No, thank you.</i>

608
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,960
<i>They're taking it seriously, then.
Giving it to some kids.</i>

609
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,680
<i>We're taking it very seriously,
Mr Duff.</i>

610
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,640
<i>I'm DS Karen Pirie,
this is DC Murray.</i>

611
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,680
<i>MACLENNAN: I'm sorry, Archie.</i>

612
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,200
<i>Thinking about Eileen.</i>

613
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,280
<i>I've let her down.</i>

614
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,240
<i>I lost our baby.</i>

615
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,840
<i>I let this happen to our poor baby.</i>

616
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,800
<i>It's not your fault, Archie.</i>

617
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,800
<i>It's not. She'd know that.</i>

618
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,680
<i>We've detained three people
for questioning.</i>

619
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>Who?!</i>

620
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,280
<i>I can't tell you any more than that
at this stage.</i>

621
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,000
<i>You have to. Who?!</i>

622
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,480
<i>I promise, I will keep you updated,
as and when...</i>

623
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,440
<i>Update us now!</i>

624
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,400
<i>If you don't,
we'll find out somehow.</i>

625
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,120
<i>Colin!</i>

626
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,720
<i>Just let Barney do his job.</i>

627
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,000
<i>Colin, we're going to want
to talk to you and Brian</i>

628
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,760
<i>about where you were last night.</i>

629
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,880
<i>What do you mean?</i>

630
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,000
<i>KAREN: We'd just like your
recollections from the night.</i>

631
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,800
<i>You're going to make us
go through all this again.</i>

632
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,440
<i>I'm sorry. I wish I didn't have to.</i>

633
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,240
<i>Started in the pub. Both of us.</i>

634
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,760
<i>Rosie was behind the bar.</i>

635
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,240
<i>She left at some point and...
and we never noticed.</i>

636
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,760
<i>Brian went off with some girl...</i>

637
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,040
<i>...said he'd come back and get us
after he was done.</i>

638
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,760
<i>When the pub emptied out, that's
when I noticed she wasn't there.</i>

639
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,200
<i>I asked Iona where she'd gone,
she said she didn't know.</i>

640
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,960
<i>Maybe she'd popped out.</i>

641
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,800
<i>MACLENNAN: What time was this?</i>

642
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,680
<i>Half two.</i>

643
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
<i>Iona gave us the keys and said
I could wait in the pub</i>

644
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,160
<i>until Brian or Rosie turned up.</i>

645
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,560
<i>Only they never did.</i>

646
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,720
<i>BRIAN: I fell asleep
in this girl's bed.</i>

647
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,040
<i>I wish I hadnae.</i>

648
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,320
<i>Every day, I wish I hadnae.</i>

649
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,120
<i>Wish I'd never gone wi' her.</i>

650
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,840
<i>How long were you in her house?</i>

651
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,000
<i>Till eight in the morning.</i>

652
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,040
<i>Came back to my dad crying.</i>

653
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,080
<i>Never seen him cry before.</i>

654
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,280
<i>SOBBING</i>

655
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,000
<i>Iona said that Rosie went to
meet someone. But didn't know who.</i>

656
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,400
<i>We know who it was.</i>

657
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,080
<i>You do?
Of course we do.</i>

658
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,800
<i>I saw him talking to her that night.
Little dark-haired one. Pathetic.</i>

659
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,200
<i>Ziggy Malkiewicz.</i>

660
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
<i>He was inviting her to the party.</i>

661
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,880
<i>But... why am I explaining this
to you?!</i>

662
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,240
<i>You know all this,
it's in the files.</i>

663
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,320
<i>It's been there for 25 years.</i>

664
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,920
<i>We are going to talk to
Dr Malkiewicz as soon as we can.</i>

665
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,040
<i>Er, Mr Duff, we noticed
from the forensic reports</i>

666
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,760
<i>that Rosie had a caesarean scar
on her stomach.</i>

667
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,840
<i>Did Rosie have a child?
I don't see how this is relevant.</i>

668
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,200
<i>There just wasn't much information
on the reports.</i>

669
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,800
<i>All right, that's enough,
time to go.</i>

670
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,920
<i>Colin...
They don't know what they're doing.</i>

671
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,560
<i>I'm sorry, Mr Duff...
Go on, get out. Get out of my house!</i>

672
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,280
<i>We're sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.</i>

673
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,440
<i>Call the pathologist, Jan. Tell them
to expedite the post-mortem.</i>

674
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,920
<i>We've gotta let those boys go
in a few hours.</i>

675
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,880
<i>We need
every bit of help we can get.</i>

676
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,960
<i>DS Pirie?</i>

677
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,640
<i>Sorry, er...</i>

678
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,600
<i>The, er... The baby didn't survive.
A day or two, maybe.</i>

679
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,120
<i>Oh. I'm sorry.</i>

680
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,480
<i>The father was a local boy,
John Stobie,</i>

681
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,000
<i>just some kid from her class
at school.</i>

682
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,520
<i>Did you ever take a look into him?</i>

683
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,040
<i>Yeah. He was at university
somewhere, I think.</i>

684
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,720
<i>He had nothing to do with it.</i>

685
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,920
<i>It's a dead end.</i>

686
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,960
<i>Thanks, Janice. I appreciate it.</i>

687
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,840
<i>Well, I didn't quite soil myself,
but I was close.</i>

688
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,120
<i>Call Register House, will you?</i>

689
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,840
<i>See if you can get a
birth certificate for Rosie's baby,</i>

690
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,440
<i>and a death certificate, too.</i>

691
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,240
<i>We need to know what happened.</i>

692
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,440
<i>And see if you can track down
a John Stobie.</i>

693
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,680
<i>I mean now.</i>

694
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,600
<i>Yeah, sorry. Just waiting
for my heart rate to come down.</i>

695
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,440
<i>Dr Malkiewicz.</i>

696
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,120
<i>DS Karen Pirie.</i>

697
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,040
<i>Would you like a drink, Karen?</i>

698
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,880
<i>Surgery always makes me thirsty.</i>

699
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,280
<i>Sure.</i>

700
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,680
<i>I'm sorry, just,
you're in there six, eight hours,</i>

701
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,160
<i>and the focus gets you through,</i>

702
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,760
<i>but then you come out and you
realise you haven't eaten anything</i>

703
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,000
<i>since last night</i>

704
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,800
<i>and you can't remember the last time
you had a glass of water.</i>

705
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,520
<i>Well, I'd be a bit worried
if my surgeon was that dehydrated.</i>

706
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,040
<i>Well, if I passed out, they'd just
stick an IV straight in to me.</i>

707
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,120
<i>It's a joke.</i>

708
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,720
<i>I know what I'm doing in there.</i>

709
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,440
<i>Ha-ha.</i>

710
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,200
<i>You haven't returned
any of my calls.</i>

711
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,960
<i>Well, I don't really have to talk
to you. This is just a courtesy.</i>

712
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,120
<i>Well, then, I will offer you
a courtesy right back.</i>

713
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,320
<i>I've been listening
to your initial interview from 1996</i>

714
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,200
<i>and wanted to give you
the opportunity</i>

715
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,400
<i>to add anything
you may have missed out.</i>

716
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,480
<i>Missed out?</i>

717
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,360
<i>Well, it's been a long time.
Perspective can change things.</i>

718
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,880
<i>No, nothing's changed.</i>

719
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,800
<i>You stand by your testimony?</i>

720
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,160
<i>You saw Rosie in the pub, and
then you found her at the cathedral?</i>

721
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,800
<i>That's right.</i>

722
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
<i>I've been speaking
to the Duff brothers.</i>

723
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,440
<i>Well, you can immediately
discount anything they have to say.</i>

724
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,560
<i>That's very convenient.</i>

725
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,920
<i>They seem pretty sure
you were involved with their sister.</i>

726
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,840
<i>They're a pair of vicious thugs.
Rosie was terrified of them.</i>

727
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,640
<i>They controlled her life.
And how do you know that?</i>

728
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,080
<i>Well, everyone knew that.</i>

729
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,760
<i>Right.</i>

730
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,320
<i>But you did know her, didn't you?</i>

731
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,840
<i>You were seeing her, weren't you?</i>

732
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,080
<i>I'm gay, Detective.</i>

733
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,840
<i>Married now.</i>

734
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,560
<i>Happily. To a man.</i>

735
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,080
<i>Have you ever had relationships
with women?</i>

736
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,840
<i>Well, there was a time
when I was working myself out.</i>

737
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,160
<i>Rosie involved in that?</i>

738
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,000
<i>No.</i>

739
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,680
<i>You know, I don't think
I want to talk to you any more.</i>

740
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,880

<i>Sir, how can we release them?</i>

751
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,680
<i>They are still under investigation, Janice.</i>

752
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,160

<i>Adopted?</i>

<i>Hi. John Stobie.</i>

768
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,720
<i>Thank you.</i>

769
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,680
<i>I mean, I knew her.
We were friends when we were wee.</i>

770
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,440
<i>You never had a relationship
with her?</i>

771
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,040
<i>Not even close.</i>

772
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,920
<i>We used to walk home from school
together sometimes,</i>

773
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,080
<i>that was the extent of it.</i>

774
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,880
<i>Did you ever sleep with her?</i>

775
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,200
<i>Never.</i>

776
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,000
<i>Is this...</i>

777
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,680
<i>from her brothers?</i>

778
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,400
<i>I don't really know
where it came from, or why.</i>

779
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:47,000
<i>I just remember one day, they were
waiting outside school for me.</i>

780
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,560
<i>They followed me halfway home,</i>

781
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,560
<i>then,
when there was no-one around...</i>

782
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,800
<i>...they jumped me.</i>

783
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,440
<i>Battered me.</i>

784
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,200
<i>Black and blue.</i>

785
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,640
<i>Did they say why?</i>

786
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,120
<i>They said I'd slept with Rosie.</i>

787
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,680
<i>Got her pregnant.</i>

788
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,040
<i>Wouldn't believe me
when I said it wasn't true.</i>

789
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,440
<i>Did you talk to Rosie about it?</i>

790
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,360
<i>I stayed far away from her
after that.</i>

791
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,680
<i>They broke my nose.</i>

792
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,200
<i>Collarbone.</i>

793
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,000

<i>why me?</i>

798
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,360
<i>Why did she tell them it was me?</i>

799
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,000
<i>It sounds as though she was
protecting someone else.</i>

800
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,560
<i>Please!</i>

801
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,240

<i>Did you dream I cheated on you

<i>No.</i>

811
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,440

813
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,360

824
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,520
<i>There's a brief reference to it
in the post-mortem,</i>

825
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,360
<i>but no further details. Why?</i>

826
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,280
<i>Well, DI MacLennan was very good
friends with Rosie's father, Archie.</i>

827
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,040
<i>He wanted it kept out of the reports
as much as possible.</i>

828
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,840
<i>She was 15 when she got pregnant.
He didn't want people finding out,</i>

829
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,320
<i>judging her, for being so young.</i>

830
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,520
<i>Right.</i>

831
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,840
<i>Why wouldn't you look into
who the father was?</i>

832
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,200
<i>The family answered that for us.</i>

833
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
<i>John Stobie?</i>

834
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,880
<i>Yeah. A local boy,
as far as I remember.</i>

835
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,880
<i>Rosie told her family the baby died.</i>

836
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,200
<i>It didn't.</i>

837
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,960
<i>There's no death certificate,
we've checked.</i>

838
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,640
<i>It was adopted.</i>

839
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,760
<i>And that local boy?
I've spoken to him.</i>

840
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,560
<i>He can't be the father
because he never slept with her.</i>

841
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,200
<i>How do you know? Have you
looked into him as a suspect?</i>

842
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,200
<i>He's got a solid alibi
for the night she died.</i>

843
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,760
<i>He was away at Leeds, at university.</i>

844
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,400
<i>There's no way he could have
killed her.</i>

845
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,920
<i>And the important thing here is...</i>

846
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,560
<i>Her child is still alive.</i>

847
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,240
<i>And we don't know
who the father was.</i>

848
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,960
<i>No. I don't think that's important -</i>

849
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,640
<i>a relationship from three years
previous? How's it connected?</i>

850
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,560
<i>The lies. Why would she hide it?</i>

851
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,600
<i>She was 15, that's why. Why would
you cover up who the father was?</i>

852
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,000
<i>Maybe he was 17, and knew
the family would press charges.</i>

853
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,760
<i>We should be looking into that!</i>

854
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,720
<i>I'd like to go to Child Services...
Hang on.</i>

855
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,920
<i>I can trace the child...
These things are sensitive.</i>

856
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,040
<i>Ask her to take a DNA test.</i>

857
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,840
<i>The Duff family would disagree.
...I could probably find the father.</i>

858
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,680
<i>PIRIE!</i>

859
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,800
<i>Tracing adopted children should
always, always be a last resort.</i>

860
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,360
<i>We can't just go marching
into people's lives causing chaos!</i>

861
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,520
<i>These things, they have to be
properly considered.</i>

862
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,680
<i>This person could be living
a perfectly happy life,</i>

863
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,400
<i>completely unaware that
their birth mother was murdered,</i>

864
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,840
<i>and that that murder
remains unsolved. But, Sir...</i>

865
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,880
<i>No.</i>

866
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,800
<i>No. We are already
under the microscope.</i>

867
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,280
<i>Anything we do, any slip-up,
it'll be podcasted</i>

868
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,520
<i>and bloody message-forumed
all over the internet...</i>

869
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,800
<i>Oh, sir, that's...
DI Lees is right, Karen.</i>

870
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,880
<i>We have to tread gently.</i>

871
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,000
<i>It's good to know
that we have that option,</i>

872
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,920
<i>should all other avenues
be exhausted.</i>

873
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,240
<i>Have you considered the possibility</i>

874
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,160
<i>that one of the students
could have been the father?</i>

875
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,680
<i>They weren't in St Andrews yet.</i>

876
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,360
<i>No. But two of them lived in
Kirkcaldy. Only half an hour away.</i>

877
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,480
<i>And they were older than her.</i>

878
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,080
<i>As Lees says, that would give her
a good reason to hide it.</i>

879
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,080
<i>I'll look into it, Sir.</i>

880
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,960
<i>Do.</i>

881
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,240
<i>Good work, Sergeant.</i>

882
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,600
<i>We could have done with some
of that thinking first time around.</i>

883
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,840
<i>All right, quick as you can.</i>

884
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,120
<i>I've been hassling forensics
for the report.</i>

885
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,200
<i>Any luck?</i>

886
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,920
<i>Not yet, but they've given us a
heads-up. They found a certain type</i>

887
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,520
<i>of fibre all over Rosie's clothes.</i>

888
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,680
<i>It needs further tests,</i>

889
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,040
<i>but they reckon they're
from carpeting found in a car.</i>

890
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,400
<i>What, over everything?</i>

891
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,200
<i>She was lying on the carpet,
probably in the boot.</i>

892
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,400
<i>She was moved.</i>

893
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,040
<i>Did the students
have any access to a vehicle?</i>

894
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,560
<i>I can find out.</i>

895
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,880
<i>We need to move the car.</i>

896
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,240
<i>How are we going to do that?
They're gonna be watching us!</i>

897
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,480
<i>We don't know that.</i>

898
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,240
<i>That's what they do -
they monitor you.</i>

899
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,160
<i>It's not worth the risk, Zig.
We just got out.</i>

900
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,760
<i>But think about how bad it'll be
if they find it.</i>

901
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,880
<i>Where did you leave it, Weird?</i>

902
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,880
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

903
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,520
<i>How can you not be sure?</i>

904
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,240
<i>I was off my face, Ziggy!
You shouldn't have been driving.</i>

905
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,600
<i>Jeez, arrest me!</i>

906
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,520
<i>Right, the girl -</i>

907
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,440
<i>the one you're driving home -</i>

908
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,880
<i>where does she live?</i>

909
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,440
<i>Well, call her! I can't! They'll be
listening in on the phone.</i>

910
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,000
<i>Don't be stupid!</i>

911
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,160
<i>And I don't have her number.
Where are the keys?</i>

912
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,400
<i>Think I left them in there.</i>

913
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,240
<i>Well, that's one smart thing
that you did.</i>

914
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,000
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

915
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,200
<i>They said that we could go back
to Kirkcaldy.</i>

916
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,840
<i>You can go to Weird's,
and I'll stay here tonight.</i>

917
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,320
<i>And do what?</i>

918
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,520
<i>I'll go out after dark
to find the car. And I'll move it.</i>

919
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,240
<i>I'll take it back.</i>

920
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,240
<i>'Did you hear about that case'</i>

921
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,240
<i>where someone threw a brick
off an overpass</i>

922
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,880
<i>and it smashed through the
windscreen and killed the driver?</i>

923
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,240
<i>No. What?</i>

924
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,040
<i>They found traces of DNA
on the brick</i>

925
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,400
<i>and then they traced him
through an ancestry website.</i>

926
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,360
<i>Oh.
And didn't you...</i>

927
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,960
<i>No. ..go on some dates... No.</i>

928
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,120
<i>...with that guy from that site?
What was his name?</i>

929
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,680
<i>Rob, and I am not going back there.
Hear me out.</i>

930
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,720
<i>Rosie lied about
who the father of her baby was.</i>

931
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,120
<i>That means there's a story there.</i>

932
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,680
<i>Something is up.</i>

933
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,920
<i>But Lees and Lawson won't let me
go to Child Services</i>

934
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,520
<i>to find out where she is.</i>

935
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,880
<i>So you want to go to
WhatsMyHeritage.com?</i>

936
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,120
<i>That's what it's called!</i>

937
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,920
<i>I know it sounds mad,
but loads of people use them now,</i>

938
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,120
<i>and they have these huge DNA banks</i>

939
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,600
<i>that might be bigger
than the police's.</i>

940
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,880
<i>I don't see how this connects.</i>

941
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,880
<i>Say you're adopted,
like Rosie's child was,</i>

942
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,360
<i>you'd probably be quite interested
in finding out</i>

943
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,200
<i>who your long lost family were.</i>

944
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,880
<i>You'd sign up to a site like that
and send in your DNA.</i>

945
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,800
<i>So you wanna send Rosie's DNA in?</i>

946
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,000
<i>Yeah. See if there's any matches.</i>

947
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,520
<i>If I can find the kid's, then I can
find the father, Rosie's ex,</i>

948
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,000
<i>and I can find out
what Rosie was hiding.</i>

949
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,400
<i>The only problem is,</i>

950
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,160
<i>they don't open up their databases
to just anyone.</i>

951
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,320
<i>No.</i>

952
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,320
<i>Oh, come on,
I thought you liked Rob? I did!</i>

953
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,160
<i>If anything, too much.</i>

954
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,680
<i>It was... intense.</i>

955
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,040
<i>Doesn't sound bad.</i>

956
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,840
<i>He sexted me all the time,
non-stop.</i>

957
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,320
<i>I honestly ran out of things to say.</i>

958
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,800
<i>I ran out of...</i>

959
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,920
<i>...camera angles.
It was exhausting - it had to end.</i>

960
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,040
<i>Come on, take one for the team!</i>

961
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,200
<i>It's poking a bear, Karen.
A horny bear.</i>

962
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,240
<i>OK.</i>

963
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,800
<i>Will you just think about it?</i>

964
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,760
<i>Fine. I mean, I do feel for you
with this podcast lady.</i>

965
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,080
<i>What do you mean?</i>

966
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,760
<i>On Twitter, she's always riling
everyone up. Look at this.</i>

967
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,280
<i>"Fife Police - victim-shaming"
and there's the video.</i>

968
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,360
<i>What video?</i>

969
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,840
<i>In light of these events,
I would like to ask the women,</i>

970
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,200
<i>particularly the young women
of St Andrews</i>

971
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,320
<i>and the surrounding areas,
to be particularly vigilant.</i>

972
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,640
<i>I would also advise against
venturing outdoors alone after dark.</i>

973
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,760
<i>And you should also make sure
that someone knows</i>

974
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,200
<i>where you are at all times.</i>

975
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,760
<i>If at any point you feel threatened
or see anything out of the ordinary,</i>

976
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,520
<i>please contact the police
straight away.</i>

977
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,160
<i>Any further questions?</i>

978
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,320
<i>Your warning implies that
it's up to the women of St Andrews</i>

979
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,800
<i>to keep themselves safe.</i>

980
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,800
<i>I just want to take any measures
we can,</i>

981
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,560
<i>combined with excellent policing,
to keep our daughters,</i>

982
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,920
<i>granddaughters, sisters,
out of harm's way.</i>

983
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,280
<i>You detained three people
and have since released them.</i>

984
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,080
<i>Is that not putting women
in more danger?</i>

985
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,880

1011

<i>And why would you?
I think the pressure helps.</i>

1016
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,200
<i>Very sure of your opinions.</i>

1017
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,880
<i>You can't think the original
investigation was well run?</i>

1018
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,920
<i>I don't think you know much

1020
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,280
<i>Aren't they supposed to review

1021
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,040
<i>Why didn't they?</i>

1022

<i>Until...</i>

1023

1236
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,680
<i>"Do you want to change your story,"
and he said no,</i>

and then the cathedral.</i>

1238

No!</i>

1242
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,160
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

1243
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,520
<i>You were seen hanging around
the Lammas bar.</i>

1244
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,920
