欢迎来到《泰勒・斯威夫特无畏之旅》

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,140
我刚收到消息

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,420

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,330

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,520

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,130
《无畏之旅》已然成为

16
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,100
我生命中一段最美好的经历

17
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,450
猜猜演出中的一站她邀请的嘉宾

18
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,080

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,880
欣赏《泰勒・斯威夫特无畏之旅》的终场演出

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,910
那场演出门票在两分钟内就卖完了

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,530
我没做梦吧

24
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,670
激情演绎

25
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,350
尽在《泰勒・斯威夫特 无畏之旅》

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,060
我非常开心的是

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,240
在我的歌唱生涯中有这样的机会

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,900
可以把视觉元素汇集到演出中

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,860
有服装 舞蹈  角色的演绎 

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,770
演出融入了诸多戏剧元素  

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,180
也投入了大量心血

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,350
我为此而感到自豪 

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,910
我希望此次巡回演出圆满成功

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,380
但没料到粉丝们的反响如此强烈

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,220
《无畏之旅》比我想象中的

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,120
盛大壮观的多

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,550
这是一场收获颇丰且轰动震撼的演出

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,400
得知每晚的演出门票都售罄

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,270
真是件美妙的事

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,070
还有比这更酷的吗

41
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,180
他们在叫我的名字

42
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,270
他们在叫我的名字

43
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,890
这是一个有关拥有的梦想的故事

44
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,500
做的每件事都是值得的

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,640
每天早起都是值得的

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,250
每件事都是有意义的

47
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,070
我的梦想实现了

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,750
这是我梦寐以求的

49
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,670
这种情况不常发生  不是吗

50
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,560
我写过很多与爱有关的歌

51
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,110
因为对我而言

52
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,610
爱是宏大而复杂的

53
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,580
但这似乎就是两个人之间的事

54
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,090
两个人试着解决问题

55
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,750
剩下的我们寻寻觅觅

56
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,020
想象着那副画面

57
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,920
只为找到自己的真爱

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,410
突然之间  每件你认为复杂的事

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,760
变得如此简单

60
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,030
每件你认为错误的事突然变得正确

61
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,390
因为你和那个人在一起得时候

62
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,830
他让你无所畏惧

63
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,020
There's somethin' 'bout the way

64
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,090
The street looks when it's just rained

65
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,920
There’s a glow off the pavement

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,630
Walk me to the car

67
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,500
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there

68
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,320
In the middle of the parking lot

69
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,300
Yeah

70
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,840
Oh yeah 

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,050
We're drivin' down the road

72
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,820
I wonder if you know

73
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,350
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now

74
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,820
But you're just so cool

75
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,460
Run your hands through your hair

76
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,990
Absent mindedly makin' me want you 

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,030
And I don't know how it gets better than this

78
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,060
You take my hand and drag me head first

79
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,570
Fearless

80
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,590
And I don't know why when with you I dance

81
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,720
In a storm in my best dress

82
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,230
Fearless 

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,030
So baby drive slow

84
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,140
‘Til we run out of road in this one horse town

85
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,820
I wanna stay right here in this passenger’s seat

86
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,200
You put your eyes on me

87
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,920
In this moment now capture it, remember it 

88
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,040
Cuz I don't know how it gets better than this

89
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,990
You take my hand and drag me head first

90
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,490
Fearless

91
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,610
And I don't know why but with you I’d dance

92
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,420
In a storm in my best dress

93
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,130
Fearless 

94
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,440
Well you stood there with me in the doorway

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,890
My hands shake

96
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm not usually this way but

97
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,630
You pull me in and I’m a little more brave

98
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,120
It’s the first kiss,

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,310
It's flawless,

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,340
Really something,

101
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,560
It’s fearless. 

102
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,210
Cuz I don't know how it gets better than this

103
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,180
You take my hand and drag me head first

104
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,770
Fearless

105
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,900
And I don't know why but with you I would dance

106
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,580
In a storm in my best dress

107
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,190
Fearless 

108
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,340
And I don't know how it gets better than this

109
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,220
You take my hand and drag me head first

110
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,850
Fearless

111
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,040
And I don't know why but with you I would dance

112
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,780
In a storm in my best dress

113
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,350
Fearless 

114
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,650
Oh yeah

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,770
oh oh

116
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,510
当你在写经历过的事情

117
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,890
你会想到到很多细节

118
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,820
比如某人的名字

119
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,800
关于谁的

120
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,990
何时发生的

121
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,220
你所见所感

122
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,540
写这些歌有些冒险

123
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,170
我觉得她情感细腻而且富有表现力

124
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:47,070
她一定要把她的人生经历写到歌里

125
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,800
只要让她坐下

126
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,370
给她一支笔  一个日记本

127
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,430
她就开心了

128
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,880
巡回演出中现场演绎这些歌

129
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,500
在舞台上唱出歌词  描绘它们

130
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,110
是非常个人的事

131
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,030
我认为人们之所以和Taylor互动是因为

132
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,450
她敢于把自己的生活公之于众

133
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,290
并且大家很赞赏这种勇气

134
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,870
我喜欢你昨晚的歌  很好听

135
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,550
谢谢

136
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,720
她在写歌上有无人能及的天赋  

137
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,230
她把日常生活都唱进了歌里

138
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,290
而且还以一种这么积极的方式

139
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,550
我真的很欣赏这点

140
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,310
我爱你  Taylor  你是最棒的

141
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,680
我们也爱你

142
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,580
我相信每个人在生活中都能和一首Taylor Swift的歌扯上关系

143
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,850
Taylor  听着

144
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,670
你写出了我的生活  太谢谢你了

145
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,940
每个人都有相同的经历

146
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,210
大多数人都想被聆听

147
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,750
所以她做得很好

148
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,010
陈词和分享故事

149
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,890
Taylor  我们爱你

150
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,360
我知道自己应该害怕因为

151
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,450
歌里提到的一些私人信息和细节受到伤害

152
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,650
但我只是不明白那会有多坏

153
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,510
Forever&Always是一首关于让我经历分手的人的歌

154
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,310
我不知道采访时被问到的话该怎么回答

155
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,130
所以那时候

156
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,860
我觉得这种问题让演唱会变得很恶心

157
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,450
如果你指的是在歌里约会过的人  

158
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,690
那你凭什么觉得他想约你

159
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,620
我想从歌的切入方式来说

160
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,860
在舞台上

161
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,260
站在这个角度  你必须在采访中谈到私人生活

162
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,400
我想在那种情况下

163
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,900
我会认为如果男人不想让我写有关他们不好的歌

164
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,680
那他们就别干坏事

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,930
那他们就别干坏事

166
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,420
Once upon a time

167
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,470
I believe it was a Tuesday

168
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,990
When I caught your eye

169
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,770
We caught onto something

170
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,130
I hold onto the night

171
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,850
You looked me in the eye

172
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,610
And told me you loved me

173
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,710
Were you just kidding

174
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,440
Cause it seems to me

175
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,200
This thing is breaking down

176
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,840
We almost never speak

177
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,670
I don't feel welcome anymore

178
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,040
Baby what happened

179
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,970
Please tell me cause one second it was perfect

180
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,660
Now you're halfway out the door

181
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,530
And I stare, at the phone

182
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,380
He still, hasn't called

183
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,490
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all

184
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,240
And you flashback to when he said

185
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,930
Forever and always

186
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,630
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong

187
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,310
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

188
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,050
Cause I was there when you said

189
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,910
Forever and always

190
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,280
Was I out of line

191
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,550
Did I say something way to honest

192
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,010
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy

193
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,880
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute

194
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,370
Now I'm not so sure

195
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,760
So heres to everything

196
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,410
Coming down to nothing

197
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,240
Heres to silence

198
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,050
That cuts me to the core

199
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,220
Where is this going

200
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,910
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

201
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,490
And I stare, at the phone

202
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,360
He still, hasn't called

203
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,490
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all

204
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,290
And you flashback to when he said

205
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,930
Forever and always

206
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,690
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong

207
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,300
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

208
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,190
Cause I was there when you said

209
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,140
Forever and always

210
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,470
Didn't mean it baby

211
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,330
感觉我真的很喜欢在舞台上表演

212
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,420
有歌曲相伴

213
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,070
我开始有点失去理智了

214
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,710
就像生了很大的怒气

215
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,440
发疯了一样  

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,800
那个举动吓坏了主持人

217
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,520
她从台上跑下去了

218
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,280
我站起来  唱完一个高音

219
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,990
然后把主持人的椅子扔到了舞台上

220
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,040
对我来说扔椅子就像是一种情绪控制

221
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,110
Back up, baby back up

222
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,420
Did you forget everything

223
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,600
Back up, baby back up

224
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,040
Did you forget everything

225
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,970
Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong

226
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,760
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

227
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,700
Cause I was there when we said

228
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,710
Forever and always

229
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,930
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong

230
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,770
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

231
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,140
Cause I was there when you said

232
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,470
歌还在继续唱

233
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,510
自然的情绪慢慢出现了

234
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,540
愤怒过后  随之而来的是伤感

235
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,840
那部分我感到很伤心  

236
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,110
是巡演初期的一个晚上

237
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,230
我把手伸出去

238
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,600
这些女孩就抓住我的手

239
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,090
然后我感觉到所有的女孩都在抓着我的手

240
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,030
那一瞬间他们像是在安慰我

241
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,610
这是这首歌很脆弱和伤感的地方  

242
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,620
我每次唱都有这种感觉

243
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,500
正是因为他们拉着我的手

244
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,550
真的很好

245
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,970
让我好受了些 

246
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,910
因此我每晚都会伸出手

247
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,950
这种互动中有一些对我很重要的东西

248
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,690
拉别人的手是很亲密的行为

249
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,630
我真的很喜欢演出的这一段

250
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,830
Back up,baby back up

251
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,270
Back up,baby back up

252
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,820
Back up,baby back up

253
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,680
Back up,baby back up

254
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,520
Please back up,baby back up

255
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,590
Back up,baby back up

256
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,920
演出中的每次间隙

257
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,220
我都有生气的想扔椅子的冲动

258
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,180
但接着真实想法会告诉你其实是因为伤心

259
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,620
你一直这样结束

260
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,600
跪在台上

261
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,240
意识到你只是希望能有人鼓励你

262
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,930
让结尾大不相同的场景

263
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:23,240
Back up,baby back up

264
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,390
Back up,baby back up

265
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,140
Back up,baby back up

266
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,150
Back up,baby back up

267
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,270
You said forever and always

268
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,170
Yeah 

269
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,070
我在路上的生活

270
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,420
有点像夏令营

271
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,400
Amos?

272
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,690
怎么了

273
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,040
你又戴发带了

274
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,490
我一直都戴兰花发带

275
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,670
我们很开心

276
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,000
Fearless巡演经过了美国  加拿大  

277
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,850
还去了日本和澳大利亚

278
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,640
最后到了英国

279
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,050
我们决定了要穿裙子

280
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,920
没错  没错  没错

281
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,500
这次巡演经历了15个月

282
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,750
一次很长的旅行

283
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,810
我和我的乐队找到了很多自娱自乐的方法

284
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,890
我们几乎遇到了所有的麻烦

285
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,830
Unes会在伦敦首次登台表演

286
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,790
在伦敦

287
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,160
我们会坐火车

288
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,410
我们要做下午茶

289
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,260
我们边表演边游览世界

290
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,300
读一下这个单词

291
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,750
inhaltsverzeichnis

292
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,000
读得不错

293
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,170
它的意思是表格或者目录

294
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,750
- 真的吗  - 很确定

295
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,640
很高兴我们做到了

296
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,830
在表演队伍里我有两个好朋友

297
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,260
Liz和Kayla

298
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,950
我们互相着迷

299
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,630
你知道狗和蜜蜂能嗅出危险吗

300
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,460
不是吧

301
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,790
还有  有部分人能吃数磅的食物

302
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,270
你觉得我不漂亮吗

303
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,310
那你干嘛还来飞机场

304
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,100
这很正常  是吗

305
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,500
绝对是  

306
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,040
即使我们很奔波

307
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,990
但也能享受家庭乐趣

308
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,240
我  Liz和Kayla在伊利诺斯州

309
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,930
找到一个厨房

310
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,760
Liz认识了一个男的

311
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,910
- 我没说是男朋友  - 最终会是的

312
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,540
今天是他的生日

313
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,780
我们将变身大厨  给他做一个蛋糕

314
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,000
盘子派对来了

315
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,150
挡住了

316
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,000
我知道我的头小

317
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,330
我像什么  随意造型好了

318
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,100
好吃

319
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,970
谢谢  Liz吃掉吧

320
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,070
我爱死蛋糕了

321
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,370
- 好可爱  - 是啊

322
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,250
小糖豆

323
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,080
我爱小糖豆

324
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,070
还有一分钟

325
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,900
- 快点吧  - 快

326
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,080
有时候我们花在厨房里的时间太多

327
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,060
因此做头发的时间很赶

328
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,660
还有多久

329
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,820
现在快8点了  还有35到40分钟左右

330
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,350
35到40分钟  能赶上的 

331
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,580
我得现在开始做头发  

332
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
我边走边帮你弄吧

333
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,850
好的  得马上开始了

334
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,890
很多人在表演前都有发型师帮忙   

335
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,690
我们没有

336
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,580
好像没什么差别

337
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,240
我们就像姐妹

338
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,110
分享打扮心得

339
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,360
每晚在后台默默准备

340
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,080
自己化妆  做头发  聊男生和生活

341
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,160
你说你的卷发跟我的很像

342
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,890
- 我没说过  - 你说了

343
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,460
我只是说你抄袭我

344
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,980
我们很了解对方

345
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,560
我不小心用卷发棒烫到泰勒的胳臂

346
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,520
不小心吗

347
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,500
是的

348
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,280
我的手肘仍在冒烟

349
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,370
- 消毒水在哪  -没有消毒水

350
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,290
没有

351
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,830
她痛到傻了

352
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,160
好笑吗

353
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,160
- 怎么了  - 他跟一女的一起

354
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,900
不是吧  谁呀

355
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,730
她在开车

356
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,020
给我看看

357
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,630
他竟然让她开车  我受够了

358
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,580
这首歌叫《Picture to Burn》

359
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,730
State the obvious

360
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,380
I didn't get my perfect fantasy

361
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,530
 I realized you love yourself 

362
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,500
 More that you could ever love me 

363
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,080
 So go and tell your friends 

364
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,360
 That I'm obsessive and crazy 

365
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,420
 That's fine 

366
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,570
 You won't mind 

367
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,980
 If I say 

368
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,080
 By the way 

369
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,480
 I hate that stupid old pickup truck 

370
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,520
 You never let me drive 

371
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,110
 You're a redneck, heartbreak 

372
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,790
 Who's really been a lie 

373
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,180
 So watch me strike a match  

374
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,880
 On all my wasted time 

375
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,750
 As far as I'm concerned 

376
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,920
 You're just another picture to burn 

377
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,980
 There's no time for tears 

378
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,670
 I'm just sitting here planning my revenge 

379
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,400
 There's nothing stopping me 

380
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,320
 From going out with all of your best friends 

381
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,190
 And if you come around saying' sorry to me 

382
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,690
 My daddy's going to show you how sorry you'll be 

383
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,030
 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck 

384
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,160
 You never let me drive 

385
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,670
 You're a redneck, heartbreak 

386
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,090
 Who's really been a lie, yeah 

387
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,650
 So watch me strike a match 

388
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,460
 On all my wasted time 

389
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,680
 As far as I'm concerned 

390
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,900
 You're just another picture to burn 

391
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,760
 And if you're missing me 

392
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,260
 You better keep it to yourself 

393
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,040
 'Cause coming back around here 

394
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,940
 Would be bad for your health 

395
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,470
 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck 

396
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,430
 You never let me drive 

397
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,970
 You're a redneck, heartbreak 

398
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,370
 Who's really been a lie, yeah 

399
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,990
 So watch me strike a match 

400
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,740
 On all my wasted time 

401
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,770
 In case you haven't heard 

402
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,230
 I really, really hate that 

403
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,290
 Stupid old pickup truck 

404
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,340
 You never let me drive 

405
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,830
 You're a redneck, heartbreak 

406
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,310
 Who's really been a lie, yeah 

407
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,870
 So watch me strike a match  

408
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,630
 On all my wasted time 

409
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,810
 As far as I'm concerned 

410
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,700
 You're just another picture to burn 

411
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,660
 Burn, burn, burn, baby burn 

412
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,860
 Just another picture to burn 

413
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,710
 Baby burn 

414
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,940
我爱你们

415
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,000
明晚是巡演的最后一场

416
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,640
亮点是在体育场举行

417
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,870
太夸张了

418
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,970
我很兴奋  几乎要疯了

419
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,330
体育场你好

420
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,060
天啊  明晚要干嘛呢

421
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,410
这是发梦吗

422
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,420
- 你们好吗  - 很好

423
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,880
很棒的体育场

424
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,870
天啊

425
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,760
没人提及明晚就是最后一场

426
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,810
大家都保持兴奋度

427
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,030
因为我超爱这次巡演

428
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,960
并全身心地投入其中

429
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,910
这地方很适合举办最后一场

430
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,520
明晚会成功的

431
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,960
这里让我很兴奋和快乐

432
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,370
这一切要结束显得有点感伤

433
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,850
因为很有趣

434
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,070
而且这是去年的全部

435
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,490
那上面是一个巨大的我

436
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,750
我们爱你

437
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,080
当我走进吉列体育场检查音效时

438
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,240
场馆空旷  我有点失控

439
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,720
围着大伙儿边舞边跑

440
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,710
我太高兴以至于不能控制自己

441
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,750
感觉就像6岁的小孩

442
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,670
站在体育场望下去时  心里想着

443
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,510
难以置信我能在此演唱

444
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,860
难以置信观众座无虚席

445
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,160
难以置信票能卖光

446
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,800
能以如此大型的演唱会结束巡演

447
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,000
我感到很疯狂

448
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,470
事实是  当泰勒11岁时

449
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,080
她在一个小地方表演

450
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,950
她在台上唱着  台下却没有听众

451
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,480
最终那次有500人给她掌声

452
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,460
当你想到我们是如何开始的

453
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,480
她对歌唱的热爱

454
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,270
对粉丝的关爱

455
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,480
以及其他事情

456
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,320
这些都让这一整年完美地落幕

457
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,790
就是这样  无畏地冲击一切

458
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,540
这一切太不可思议

459
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,930
这是我所合作过最棒的一个团队

460
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,660
我已经开始想念每一个人了

461
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,950
十五个月来造就了一场无懈可击的旅程

462
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,180
人生中最无悔值得的一次经历

463
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,230
这一切真是太棒了

464
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,100
这一切真是太不可思了

465
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,760
有像她这样的人和你一起演出

466
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,420
你就感到这一切都停留在了一瞬间

467
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,200
每一场演出都像是置身于童话故事一样

468
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,800
这种切真体会  从始至终

469
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,940
和这样大的一个团队北上演出
是我梦寐以求的事情

470
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,200
虽然已经临近了演出的末尾  

471
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,190
但一切的回忆  一切所走过的地方  

472
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,490
还有每一个人  都会牢牢铭记在心

473
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,690
我不淡定了  太不淡定了

474
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,690
这真是不可思议了  五万人汇聚在这里

475
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:00,080
会有动情时刻  
会热情高涨  还有一点小戏剧

476
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,640
真的太棒了  真的

477
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,800
接近巡演结束的感觉  
就像是快要毕业时的感觉

478
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,040
我未曾经历过这些感觉  

479
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,380
我从未在毕业典礼上等着被叫到自己的名字  

480
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,880
然后把学术帽抛向天空

481
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,720
我想这一切的经历  就像是如此

482
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,810
年册诶  太棒了

483
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,610
在最后一场演出之前  
我们把大家叫到了T-party室

484
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,470
为每一个人都分发了一本我们一起设计的年册

485
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,720
年册貌似让每一个人都眼前一亮

486
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,540
这个太赞了  

487
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,240
真的让大家都兴奋地尖叫起来

488
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,570
让他们在最后一场演出后又多了一个精神的寄托

489
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,040
我从来没有在高中买过年册  说实话我恨透高中生活了

490
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,840
现在有了这样一本我真的很开心  

491
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,510
一本能让我真正感同身受的年册

492
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,180
我太喜欢了  能和这样的团队一起合作是我的荣幸

493
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,890
棒极了  太炫了  我永远都不会忘记的

494
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,280
华华丽丽的完美落幕

495
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,490
我很开心我们能这样子做

496
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,550
因为现在每一个人都会有一本  

497
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,290
满载着我们一年之中一起成长记录的年册

498
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
每一个人都在年册后面签字  

499
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,590
就像在学校里为年册签字一样

500
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,050
大家好  我是Justin  

501
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,950
我只是想说来这里和Taylor一起表演是我的荣耀

502
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:53,000
这绝对是超赞的经历  她人超好  她很搞笑 

503
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,000
是一起出去疯玩的好对象  总之我真的很荣幸能来到这里 

504
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,210
谢谢大家  我们一会儿舞台上见

505
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,830
在最后一场演唱会登台前  我告诉了所有的人

506
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,550
我多么爱他们  我多么感激他们能陪我走过这一切

507
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,570
他们所有的人都会永远留在我的心里 

508
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,060
外面的观众已经激情高涨了  

509
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,170
而我们每一分每一秒都有着不同的感受 

510
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,770
因为这是最后一次  我们能像这样围成一个圈

511
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,050
我这个人不会轻易相信谁  可我今天想让你们知道  

512
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,540
我相信你们  因为我们一起经历这么多  

513
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,770
这点永远都不会改变

514
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,910
我们这个团体就像兄弟  就像姐妹

515
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,420
不经意地能够站在最大的舞台  享受最多人群的召唤

516
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,940
外面可是座无虚席  这一切都是我们一起努力的成果

517
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,960
无论如何  我永远都会爱你们每一个人  都会相信你们

518
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,430
这就是爱  这也是我这一生唯一遇到的一次真爱

519
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:37,750
让我们一起  无畏前行  永远不忘共度的时光

520
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:50,610
爱你  Taylor  爱你  Taylor

521
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,480
-我都快哭了  -不许哭

522
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,410
-别哭  我爱你  -我也爱你

523
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:12,960
麻省的人们你们好吗  欢迎来到无畏之旅演唱会的最后一站

524
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:26,570
我这辈子从没见过这样的场面  谢谢你们  谢谢

525
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,310
我认为Taylor的成长旅程  是一段不经预料的惊喜

526
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,820
一个能够长久的惊喜  一个能让大家依靠欣慰的惊喜

527
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,180
让人们能够对她的歌产生共鸣  

528
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:57,550
以至于每一个人都放肆疯狂的成为她的歌迷

529
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,080
 You pull me in and I’m a little more brave 

530
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,670
 It’s the first kiss really something 

531
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,440
 It’s fearless. 

532
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,920
每一次当我站在舞台上  

533
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:14,280
唱起我为其他就和我一样的女孩写的歌时

534
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,740
都会听到  整个世界都在和你一起唱着

535
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:23,250
能把这种情感唱出来  让别人哭着把他们的情感释放出来

536
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,250
对你的歌产生共鸣  这对我来说是最棒的经历

537
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:39,940
这首歌写的是一个男孩背叛了我  可他不应该这么做

538
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,840
因为我会写歌  他应该说不的

539
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,710
 It's strange to think the songs we used to sing 

540
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,820
 The smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone 

541
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,690
 Yesterday I found out about you 

542
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,650
 Even now just looking at you: feels wrong 

543
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,350
 You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance 

544
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:33,380
 It was a moment of weakness and you said yes 

545
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,550
 You should've said no, you should've gone home 

546
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,320
 You should've thought twice before you let it all go 

547
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,910
 You should've know that word, bout what you did with her 

548
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,710
 Would get back to me 

549
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,490
 And I should've been there, in the back of your mind 

550
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,300
 I shouldn't be asking myself why 

551
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:55,150
 You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet 

552
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,920
 You should've said no, baby and you might still have me 

553
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,120
You can see that I've been cryin'

554
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,380
Baby you know all the right things

555
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,680
To say

556
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,810
But do you, honestly

557
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,730
Expect me, to believe

558
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,230
We could ever be the same

559
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,450
You say, that the past is the past

560
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,660
You need one chance, it was a moment of weakness

561
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,860
And you said yes

562
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,760
You should've said no

563
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,130
You should've gone home

564
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,940
You should have thought twice before you let it all go

565
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,520
You should've known that word about 

566
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,030
what you did with her would get back to me

567
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,050
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind

568
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,870
Shouldn't be asking myself why

569
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,720
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

570
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,640
You should've said no

571
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,090
Baby and you might still have me

572
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,800
Woo you should said no, baby

573
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,440
Woo you should said no, baby

574
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,190
Woo you should said no, baby

575
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,100
Woo now everybody knows

576
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,590
Woo you should said no, baby

577
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,350
Woo you should said no, baby

578
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,050
Woo you should said no, baby

579
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,670
Woo now everybody knows

580
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,970
I can't resist

581
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,980
Before you go tell me this

582
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,820
Was it worth it

583
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:43,860
Was she worth this

584
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:53,290
No, no, no, no，no，no

585
00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:04,810
No, no, no, no，no，no

586
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,340
You should've said no

587
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,990
You should've gone home

588
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,640
You should have thought twice before you let it all go

589
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,450
You should've known that word about what you did with her would get back to me

590
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,550
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind

591
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,360
Shouldn't be asking myself why

592
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,390
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

593
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,140
You should've said no

594
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,670
Baby and you might still have me

595
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,560
我的天呐  宝贝

596
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,630
我真为你骄傲

597
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,690
我们刚刚5万5千人观众

598
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,900
完成了一场很棒的演出

599
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,140
对我来说  这是最棒的事了

600
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,280
我简直不能相信我做到了

601
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,500
我简直不能相信巡回演唱会就这样结束了

602
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,800
我和乐队都哭了

603
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,500
每个人都很激动

604
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,860
这一幕很美

605
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,080
我高兴坏了

606
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,520
今晚我们开完了演唱会

607
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,730
今晚我们搞定了

608
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,820
这个巡回演唱会的结束

609
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,740
不止是巡回演唱会的结束

610
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,530
它更像我生命中整个"无畏之旅"阶段的结束

611
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,080
这是一段很有趣的旅程

612
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,050
因为这一段旅程时间很长

613
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,740
从16岁起  我开始写歌

614
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,090
之后  就是出第一张唱片

615
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,950
同时开演唱会

616
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,510
18岁时出第一张专辑

617
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,530
19岁开始上媒体

618
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,610
以无畏之旅开启我的生活和我的事业

619
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,480
是一段非常美好的时光

620
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,150
专辑的一切相关活动都让我感觉不可思议

621
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,100
当我结束巡回演唱会

622
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,980
我马上飞回纳什维尔

623
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,230
之后  几乎每天全部泡在录音室里

624
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,480
年度录影带

625
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,050
下一张专辑《Speak Now》

626
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,100
讲述的是我18岁到20岁的生活

627
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,260
在这段时间里  我经历了许多事情

628
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,450
她的确把她的经历写入了专辑里

629
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,200
她的音乐和她共同成长

630
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,920
她就像一张时间表一样

631
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,400
你会更加了解她的私下的一面

632
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,450
你可能会难以置信

633
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,800
她和我们分享了那么多自己的故事

634
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,090
但一切会更好

635
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,790
我从没见过她这么开心

636
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,820
她开心地实现自我

637
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,730
开心地写自己的歌

638
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,700
更重要的是

639
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,390
她过的很开心

640
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,200
我非常兴奋地期待下一站旅程

641
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,650
因为下一站是我引以为傲的东西

642
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,750
我迫不及待地想在舞台上演绎它们

643
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,550
我迫不及待地想把它们拍成录影带

644
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,370
我迫不及待地看观众们把歌词画上脸上

645
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,800
这些一定会非常非常棒

646
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


647
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
