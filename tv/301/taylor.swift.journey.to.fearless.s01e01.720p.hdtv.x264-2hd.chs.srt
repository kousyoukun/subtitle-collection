欢迎收看Taylor Swift的无畏之旅

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,400
You belong with me

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,930
You belong with me

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,590
这是一个从小就怀揣远大理想的小女孩的故事

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,590
从最早这样的表演

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,320
Twinkle twinkle little star

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,680
确实确实是很小的时候

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,270
再到人生第一个转折点

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,400
那是我第一次当着那么多人唱歌

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,050
演出非常成功

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,230
前进道路上满是荆棘

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,670
我有一段时间  没有朋友

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,120
作为她的妈妈  听说他人对自己孩子都避而远之

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,470
心里很不是滋味的

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,610
她那时并不知道

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,890
但是即使在孩提时期  Taylor也是无畏的

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,770
大家好  我是Taylor  我11岁

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,590
我想签约  给我打电话吧  会有惊喜哦

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,280
我们会向您揭示《Fearless》专辑的制作过程

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,900
分享你们喜爱的歌曲背后的灵感

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,500
这首歌是关于分手的故事

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,730
是我的真实经历

32
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,690
和Taylor一起见证她的第一次巡回演出

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,530
接下来的三个晚上

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,110
从台前到幕后  跟随Taylor的步伐

35
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,310
一起分享她的无畏之旅

36
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,560
《Taylor Swift的无畏之旅》

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,250
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

38
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,680
You Belong With Me

39
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,680
Been here all along so why can't you see

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,550
You belong with me

41
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,190
You belong with me

42
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,290
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,990
She's going off about something that you said

44
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,760
'Cuz she doesn't get your humor like I do

45
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,070
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night

46
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,560
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,330
And she'll never know your story like I do

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,470
But she wears short skirts

49
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,100
I wear T-shirts

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,980
She's cheer captain

51
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,780
And I'm on the bleachers

52
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,000
Dreaming about the day when you wake up

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,610
And find what you're looking for

54
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,700
Has been here the whole time

55
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,380
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

56
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,080
Been here all along so why can't you see

57
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,910
You belong with me

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,100
You belong with me

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,880
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,490
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be

61
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,410
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,600
Hey isn't this easy

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,480
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

64
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,970
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down

65
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,980
You say you're fine

66
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,450
I know you better then that

67
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,950
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

68
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,890
She wears high heels

69
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,600
I wear sneakers.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,170
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers

71
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,290
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

72
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,110
That what you're looking for

73
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,170
Has been here the whole time

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,970
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

75
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,750
Been here all along so why can't you see

76
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,740
You belong with me

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,410
Standing by and waiting at your back door

78
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,900
All this time how could you not know

79
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,140
Baby

80
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,660
You belong with me

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,100
You belong with me

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,480
I remember you drivin'to my house

83
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,280
In the middle of the night

84
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,010
I'm the one who makes you laugh

85
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,130
When you know you're about to cry

86
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,710
And I know your favorite songs

87
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,580
And you tell me about your dreams

88
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,520
Think I know where you belong

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,840
Think I know it's with me

90
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,660
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you

91
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,610
Been here all along

92
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,400
So why can't you see

93
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,550
you belong with me

94
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,900
Standing by and waiting at your back door

95
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,360
All this time

96
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,590
How could you not know

97
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,760
Baby 

98
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,320
you belong with me

99
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,600
you belong with me

100
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,630
you belong with me

101
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,140
Have you ever thought just maybe

102
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,930
you belong with me

103
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,230
you belong with me

104
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,390

《Taylor Swift的无畏之旅》

108
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,110
Twinkle twinkle little star

109
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,820
从我特别小的时候开始我就喜欢音乐

110
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,950
印象最深的是夏天去海滩的时候

111
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,330
我会到处跑  边跑边唱

112
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,260
Taylor

113
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,880
我八九岁的时候

114
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,030
得到我人生中的第一把吉他

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,880
那时我还无法学弹吉他

116
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,070
因为我的手太小了

117
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,280
虽然吉他一直在我身边

118
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,790
但被我弃置在角落里

119
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,280
当我12岁的时候

120
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,550
神奇的事情发生了

121
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,650
我父母请了一个人来修我的电脑

122
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,270
那时我正在做作业

123
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,300
他看到了角落那把吉他

124
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,870
他问我"你弹吉他么"

125
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,510
我说"没有  我想弹  但是...不能"

126
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,800
他说"你想要我教你么"

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,860
我说"好啊  太好了"

128
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,030
自那以后  我就对吉他爱不释手了

129
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,400
我一有空就写歌

130
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,420
我记得我写的第一首完整的歌叫Lucky You

131
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,160
写的是一个敢于与众不同的女孩

132
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,390
那个时候  她就是  写自己

133
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,270
我常常被取笑  常常被嘲笑

134
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,100
我那个时候  没有朋友

135
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,350
其他小女孩都忙着玩寄宿之夜

136
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,550
或者玩足球

137
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,910
而Taylor只想登台演出

138
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,490
这与大家格格不入

139
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,210
译注: 费城76人队 NBA球队 主场:Wachovia Center

140
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,210
2002年4月5日 费城七六人队主场

141
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,780
我站在巨大的篮球场中央演唱

142
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,440
身着印有美国国旗的亮片T恤

143
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,990
白色牛仔裤  还戴了红色发箍

144
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,190
一副爱国者的形象

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,220
我这辈子从没那么紧张过

146
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,550
再次感谢  Taylor Swift

147
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,280
演出被当地报纸大肆报道

148
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,770
第二天上学的时候  

149
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,210
招来别人的各种羡慕嫉妒恨

150
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,720
那天最难受的是

151
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,770
当我去接Taylor放学的时候

152
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,920
我知道这一天她也许过得很难

153
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,530
我会对发生的事有所耳闻

154
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,560
但对于一位妈妈来说

155
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,510
听到这种事发生在学校  心里很难过

156
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,590
午饭时  只要有她坐的地方

157
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,820
大家都会远远躲开

158
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,900
对于家长来说

159
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,330
没什么比看到孩子受伤更让人心疼的事了

160
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,830
你想要帮她讨还公道

161
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,930
但我知道  这是她不得不经历的事

162
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,960
在我脑中  

163
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,160
这个叫纳什维尔的地方是我的圆梦之地

164
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,780
无数音乐人才在那里被挖掘出来

165
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,630
我对自己说  纳什维尔  我一定要去

166
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,290
我大概求了父母整整一年

167
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,710
带我去纳什维尔吧   

168
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,880
不断恳求

169
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,890
我想去纳什维尔

170
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,940
百折不挠

171
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,190
说话总离不开这件事

172
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,370
就当是休息一下

173
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,590
我们去纳什维尔  看看结果如何

174
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
每一个到纳什维尔的人

175
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,850
都和我当时的梦想一样

176
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,180
那就是  成为一个艺术家

177
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,470
想要上台表演  下面座无虚席

178
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,890
看啊  那是水星唱片公司

179
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,080
快停车

180
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,200
我要把样带给他们听听

181
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,690
我下车走进去  自我介绍

182
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,770
我叫Taylor  今年11岁

183
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,140
我想要签约

184
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,940
请给我电话  会有惊喜哦

185
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,630
我知道自己要找到一种与众不同的风格

186
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,910
耳目一新的

187
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,970
更具内涵的

188
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,020
要想让我快乐

189
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,170
绝不能少了音乐

190
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,880
我可以连续弹上几个小时吉他

191
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,790
直到弹到手指流血

192
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,770
她从不放下吉他

193
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,560
她也从不愿放下吉他

194
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,070
我们不得不命令她

195
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,140
把吉他放下  吃完晚饭再弹

196
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,860
在那时候  让她放下吉他成了一个很棘手的问题

197
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,730
我完全爱上了音乐

198
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,120
你正在收看的是HUB台

199
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,280
马上回来

200
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,220
我们在Taylor拿到发展合同后

201
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,640
决定搬到纳什维尔去

202
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,430
作为父母  我们很自豪

203
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,270
觉得应该支持她到最有发展前途的领域中去

204
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,190
13岁的时候

205
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,540
我和RCA接触

206
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,640
他们和我签订发展合同

207
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,370
我们看好你  但也有担心

208
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,510
看看发展再说

209
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,370
并不是要给你出专辑

210
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,930
我和Taylor一周去一次

211
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,750
带着她写的新曲

212
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,130
他们看后会说  不错

213
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,660
还像回事

214
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,640
但他们从没说

215
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,250
就是这首  这是很棒的曲子

216
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,530
我们出专辑吧

217
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,880
在年底的时候

218
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,270
他们有机会和我签约

219
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,180
也可以不签约再观察一年

220
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,870
但是他们说

221
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,840
我们还不想冒险给她出专辑

222
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,910
我做了一件在纳什维尔算是大胆的事

223
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,300
我们和公司大吵一架  然后走人了

224
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,010
因为我感觉没机会做自己的音乐了

225
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,420
所以走得干脆

226
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,160
我很慌张

227
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,330
这可是知名唱片公司啊

228
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,900
这种机会可不是每天都有机会遇到的

229
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,990
你真的要走吗

230
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,310
她毫不犹豫说是

231
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,600
我在蓝鸟咖啡屋演出

232
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,260
讽刺的是

233
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,010
在那里他们发现了Faith Hill

234
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,990
我弹唱了几首自己写的歌

235
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,450
观众中有个叫Scott的人

236
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,660
演出结束后他找到我

237
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,990
他说  我想给你出专辑 

238
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,500
我要你用自己写的歌曲

239
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,110
我激动极了

240
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,540
后来他打电话约我见面谈

241
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,330
好消息是  我想给你出唱片

242
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,410
坏消息是  我还没有唱片公司

243
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,180
他向我解释

244
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,610
他没有办公大楼

245
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,380
也没想好公司名称

246
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,750
只是有这样一个梦想

247
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,900
你能等我实现这些吗

248
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,950
不知为什么

249
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,600
我决定相信他

250
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,750
她放心将专辑交给这个人做

251
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,800
而这个人也相信她会有所作为

252
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,430
如果我能和这家公司一起成长

253
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,750
做这家公司的第一位签约歌手

254
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,120
我并不介意

255
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,140
只要能完成我冒险  大胆  创新的心愿

256
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,520
所以我和Scott Borchetta签约了

257
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,530
出了一张专辑  里面都是我自己写的歌

258
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,840
这个红色的小东西

259
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,380
能够屏蔽杂音

260
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,620
是最棒的器材

261
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,440
像这样的声音  都会屏蔽掉

262
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,940
棒极了

263
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,980
这种情况下  没有人看好我们

264
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,930
但我们却很有信心

265
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,930
出第一张单曲的时候

266
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,760
我非常激动

267
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,450
因为我不知道会不会成功

268
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,910
我还记得自己把专辑装入信封 

269
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,930
和妈妈一起把这些送到电台

270
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,970
跑了好多个电台

271
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,290
你一定以为是坐旅游车吧

272
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,770
不是  租了一辆车而已

273
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,760
只有一个游客

274
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,840
就是躺在后排的我

275
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,800
Big 98 WSIX 
2009年9月8日

276
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,500
你好  甜心

277
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,010
最近怎么样

278
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,470
很好

279
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,780
我给你带曲奇来了

280
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,140
这是你做的

281
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,370
Taylor Swift 
自制曲奇
 敬请品尝

282
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,050
走访了无数个电台

283
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,820
每次去电台

284
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,770
我都会在会议室为几个DJ演唱

285
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,570
求他们为我广播

286
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,830
这很有效

287
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,960
我的专辑第一周卖出了39,000张

288
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,270
之后销售量直线飙升

289
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,640
后来发生的事情远远超乎预料

290
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,540
我和所有想象的到的

291
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,800
乡村音乐明星见面

292
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,100
Brad Paisley

293
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,310
Kenny Chesney

294
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,630
Tim Mcgraw

295
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,120
和他们同台演出

296
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,470
我紧张至极

297
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,770
反复排练

298
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,180
我很享受那种感觉

299
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,460
那是我最怀念的日子之一

300
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,500
这首歌我很喜欢

301
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,640
如果你手里有手机  荧光棒

302
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,600
或者任何能够发光的东西

303
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,610
举起来让我看到

304
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,770
我希望大家和我一起唱

305
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,620
因为这是这是我被大家所熟知的第一首歌

306
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,240
You said the way my blue eyes shined

307
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,500
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night

308
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,760
I said, that's a lie

309
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,460
Just a boy in a Chevy truck

310
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,550
That had a tendency of getting stuck

311
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,180
On backroads at night

312
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,480
And I was right there beside him

313
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,110
All summer long 

314
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,950
And then the time we woke up to Find that summer'd gone 

315
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,240
But when you think, Tim McGraw

316
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,480
I hope you think my favorite song 

317
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,680
The one we danced to all night long

318
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,000
The moon like a spotlight on the lake 

319
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,000
When you think happiness

320
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,570
I hope you think that little black dress

321
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,740
Think of my head on your chest

322
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,710
And my old faded blue jeans 

323
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,260
When you think Tim McGraw

324
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,170
I hope you think of me 

325
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,560
September saw a month of tears

326
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:47,220
And thanking God that you weren't here

327
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,650
To see me like that 

328
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,580
But in a box beneath my bed

329
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,490
Is a letter that you never read

330
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,660
From three summers back 

331
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,800
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet

332
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,330
And looking back on all of that It's nice to believe

333
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,890
When you think, Tim McGraw

334
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,040
I hope you think my favorite song 

335
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,290
The one we danced to all night long

336
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,650
The moon like a spotlight on the lake 

337
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,620
When you think happiness

338
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,170
I hope you think, that little black dress

339
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,240
Think of my head on your chest

340
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,340
And my old faded blue jeans 

341
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,760
When you think Tim McGraw

342
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,050
I hope you think of me

343
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,040
穿过那层层人群感觉真的太好了

344
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,100
人们都在尖叫

345
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,060
我自己也很喜欢使别人兴奋

346
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,090
那真的是我最爱做的事

347
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,660
那首歌唱完后

348
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,190
我下台拥抱了好多好多人

349
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,360
我向那些头一次来看演唱会的孩子表达爱意

350
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,380
到台下去到人群中去

351
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,350
向他们打招呼

352
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,480
感谢他们前来捧场

353
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,160
站在那儿和他们近距离的接触

354
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,060
这些对我来说真的非常重要

355
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,740
因为我一直想跟他们走近些

356
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,860
因为我无法相信

357
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,900
没有了他们我还能走多远

358
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,740
在我做过的所有事情中

359
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,780
那真的是我最爱做的一件了

360
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,450
And I'm back for the first time since then

361
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,770
I'm standing on your street

362
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,180
And there's a letter left on your doorstep

363
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,090
And the first thing that you'll read

364
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,490
Is, when you think, Tim McGraw

365
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,020
I hope you think my favorite song

366
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,780
Turn your stand radio on

367
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,600
I hope it takes you back to that place

368
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,210
When you think happiness

369
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,740
I hope you think that little black dress

370
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,880
Think of my head on your chest

371
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,980
And my old faded blue jeans

372
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,470
When you think Tim McGraw

373
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,830
I hope you think of me

374
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,090
Oh, think of me

375
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,080
Whoo-o-o-o-o

376
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,690
You said the way my blue eyes shined

377
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,320
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night 

378
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,430
I said, that's a lie

379
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,070
我真的很喜欢上学

380
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,520
我很庆幸自己上了高中

381
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,400
所有的孩子都很好

382
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,150
我也不是头一次被当成怪物了

383
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,590
他们真的从没在意过我

384
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,090
想成为一名歌手的梦想

385
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,240
九年级开学的第一天

386
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,740
初次踏进高中校园

387
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:08,050
我的第一节课坐在一个红发女孩儿旁边

388
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,720
我们立刻就成为了好朋友

389
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,680
因为我们都是那种在英语课上

390
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,130
很鬼马的人

391
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,860
我们彼此惺惺相惜

392
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,370
为相同的事情兴奋或开心

393
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,750
我们的目标也相同

394
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,540
我们非常合得来

395
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,880
她成为我写完歌后的首个听众

396
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,860
我真的非常非常珍惜那些时光

397
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,910
有人愿意为我演奏她的新歌

398
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,900
那是我和她在一起中最美好的一段时光

399
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,100
做她喜爱的事情

400
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,600
看她那样激情地唱歌

401
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,700
我会去她家

402
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,080
坐在她房间里唱歌给她听

403
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,780
她就像个超级啦啦队长

404
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,240
我每次夸她  她都表现的很震惊

405
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,250
一脸惊讶的样子

406
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,390
真的吗  谢谢你  太谢谢你了

407
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,620
她总是心存感激

408
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,750
我想写首关于我俩共同经历的歌

409
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,400
当我们过完15岁

410
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,470
成为一名高中新生

411
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,640
你就像是在一个巨大的世界里遨游

412
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,420
十六七岁  对女生来说

413
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,820
那是最艰难的岁月

414
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,210
因为那时你得给自己定位

415
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,290
努力认识自己

416
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,260
你在高中校园里就像是沧海一粟一样

417
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,090
当你一路艰难的走来

418
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,460
也学会了很多

419
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,200
You take a deep breath

420
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,400
And you walk through the doors 

421
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,520
It's the morning of your very first day 

422
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,650
You say hi to your friends

423
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,330
You ain't seen in a while  

424
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,110
Try and stay out of everybodys' way

425
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,390
It's your freshman year

426
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,490
And you're gonna be here 

427
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,720
For the next four years in this town 

428
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,720
Hoping one of those senior boys Will wink at you and say 

429
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,980
You know I haven't seen you around

430
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,490
Before 

431
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,340
Cause when you're fifteen 

432
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,970
Somebody tells you they love you 

433
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,380
You're gonna believe them 

434
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,120
And when you're fifteen 

435
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,810
Feeling like there're

436
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,990
Nothing to figure out 

437
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,660
Well count to ten, take it in 

438
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,750
This is life before 

439
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:56,750
Who you're gonna be fifteen

440
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:12,480
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail

441
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,330
And soon enough you're best friends

442
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,000
Laughing at the other girls 

443
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,110
Who thinks they're so cool

444
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,010
Will be out of here as soon as we can

445
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,150
我记得第一次对Abigail唱这首歌

446
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,460
还只是吉他版本的

447
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,350
她被震惊了

448
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,880
我觉得难以置信

449
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,680
这首歌非常打动人

450
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,840
直到现在也是如此

451
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,810
Your mum's waiting up

452
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,440
And you're thinking that he's the one

453
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:50,470
And you dance around your room when the night ends

454
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,070
When the night ends

455
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,300
Cause when you're fifteen

456
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,720
在这首歌里讲述的

457
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,380
是她的一个很私人的故事

458
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,340
非常原始和真实

459
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,180
每个人都在问我

460
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,550
这首歌会不会冒犯到我

461
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,760
一点也没有

462
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,020
因为身处于听众之中

463
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,890
看到大家与歌曲产生共鸣

464
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,330
正是我所期待的

465
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,180
Makes your head spin round

466
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,500
But in your life 

467
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,190
You'll do things greater than 

468
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,140
Dating the boy on the football team

469
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,090
I didn't know it at fifteen

470
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,920
When all you wanted is to be wanted

471
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,630
Wish you could go back

472
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,760
And tell yourself what you know now

473
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
Back then I swore

474
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,930
I was gonna marry him someday

475
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,820
But I realize some bigger dreams of mine

476
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:15,380
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy

477
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:21,350
Who changed his mind and we both cried

478
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,960
我很荣幸她会谈到我

479
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,150
还有我的经历

480
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,210
并且写在歌里

481
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,740
与无数的人分享

482
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,230
关于这首歌我最高兴的事情是

483
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,500
她对此感到骄傲

484
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,550
也许她的故事能够帮助别的女孩

485
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,130
为命运做出正确的选择

486
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,500
To look before you fall

487
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,030
就像歌里写的那样

488
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,010
能够三思而后行

489
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,340
I've found that time can heal most anything

490
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,730
And you just might find who you're supposed to be

491
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,950
I didn't know who I was supposed to be

492
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,310
At fifteen

493
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,630
Your very first day

494
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,060
You take a deep breath girl

495
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,140
Take a deep breath 

496
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,850
As you walk through the doors

497
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,220
我第一张专辑的大部分歌曲

498
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,670
灵感都是来自高中生活

499
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,220
我有首歌叫《You belong with me》

500
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,400
就是关于对学校里的女生

501
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,870
感到生气的歌曲

502
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,560
因为她是啦啦队队长

503
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,120
学校里最受欢迎的女孩

504
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,440
而你自己却是无名之辈

505
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,340
对我而言

506
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,780
高中时期只是坐在那里

507
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,070
感知身边的一切

508
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,800
就让我学到了很多

509
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,530
我的那首《Teardrops on my guitar》

510
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,320
是彻底地坦白自己爱上了某个人

511
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,760
曾经有段时间

512
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,900
出现了一个男孩

513
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,060
于是我在歌里写到这个男孩

514
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,520
然后在歌里给他取了个名字

515
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,680
而这个男孩

516
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,090
在教室里曾经坐在我旁边

517
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,200
当我对某个人产生迷恋的时候

518
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,640
我就会在我的歌里给他取名字

519
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,510
这感觉就像你迫不及待要到他面前

520
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,630
告诉他你的感觉

521
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,790
告诉他你是谁

522
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,090
好吧我承认

523
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,040
我完全爱上了这个男孩

524
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,070
但是他甚至不知道我的存在

525
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,770
但是日复一日

526
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,020
他都会来教室

527
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,890
而且日复一日

528
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,430
他都坐在我的身边

529
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,960
有时候他甚至会和我讲话

530
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,870
但是讲的是他的女朋友

531
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,330
所以我一直没告诉他

532
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,920
我喜欢他

533
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,440
但是我写了一首有关他的歌

534
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,170
我猜现在他应该知道了

535
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,610
Drew looks at me

536
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,930
用Drew这个名字

537
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,130
大家都知道我说的是谁了

538
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,220
《Teardrops on my guitar》

539
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,880
What I want and I need

540
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,580
And everything that we should be

541
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,840
I'll bet she's beautiful

542
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,150
That girl he talks about

543
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,230
And she's got everything

544
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,050
That I have to live without

545
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,270
我不敢相信

546
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,770
这是我第一次看到她

547
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,510
在歌曲中这么深入地表达了自己

548
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,620
I laugh cause it's just so funny

549
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,540
I can't even see

550
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,790
Anyone when he's with me

551
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,050
He says he's so in love

552
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,650
He's finally got it right

553
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,360
I wonder if he knews

554
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,370
He's all I think about at night

555
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,810
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

556
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,590
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star

557
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,120
He's the song in the car I keep singing

558
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,850
Don't know why I do

559
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:28,530
Drew walks by me

560
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,020
Can he tell that I can't breathe

561
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,730
And there he goes so perfectly

562
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,690
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

563
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,480
She better hold him tight

564
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,500
Give him all her love

565
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,900
Look in those beautiful eyes

566
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,600
And know she's lucky cause

567
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,860
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

568
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,560
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star

569
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,210
He's the song in the car I keep singing

570
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,730
Don't know why I do

571
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,520
而这个叫Drew的男孩

572
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,780
在大约一年半后出现在我的车道上

573
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,370
我不知道

574
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,690
有时候真的很尴尬

575
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,770
没错  那状况真的很尴尬

576
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,760
我想她一定很震惊

577
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,690
我们都有些吃惊

578
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,930
谁能想到这发生的一切呢

579
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,150
So I drive home alone

580
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,480
As I turn out the light

581
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,590
I'll put his picture down

582
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,600
And maybe get some sleep tonight

583
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,870
'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

584
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:48,170
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart

585
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,280
He's the song in the car I keep singing

586
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,790
Don't know why I do

587
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,960
He's the time taken up but there's never enough

588
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,270
And he's all that I need to fall into

589
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:17,750
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see

590
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,670
今天早些时候我们进行了排演

591
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,100
现在  要飞去纽约

592
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,990
在那边呆一晚

593
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,560
为明天做准备

594
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,200
发行唱片前的那几天

595
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,770
简直就是  忙疯了

596
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,430
行程爆满  忙得不得了

597
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,790
这辈子疯狂的一天啊

598
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,430
《Fearless》那张专辑发行前夕

599
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,970
我俩相视  发现

600
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,560
她真的是活在自己的梦里

601
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,380
Taylor Swift

602
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,660
天呐

603
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,320
见到你太幸福了

604
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,800
今天实在忙抽了

605
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,640
差一刻五点就爬起来

606
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,800
做头发化妆  一通折腾

607
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,190
之后赶去上《早安美国》的节目

608
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,890
到那之后

609
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,420
做一些表演啊  采访什么的

610
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,550
然后离开赶去MTV

611
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,610
在那里做一堆新闻采访

612
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,320
嗨  Trisha  我爱你  生日快乐

613
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,330
之后又赶去WPLJ

614
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,780
Taylor Swift

615
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,570
谢谢大家来捧场  太给力了

616
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,990
新唱片今天就要发行了

617
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,200
我真的超激动

618
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,810
再之后呢

619
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,980
我们又去David Letterman的秀场

620
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,390
那是我第一次在那里表演

621
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,360
感觉超棒的

622
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,040
我无比期待Letterman的脱口秀

623
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,600
那个秀总是各种欢乐

624
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,620
用笛子吹《Fearless》真的很有趣

625
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,220
现在我上了飞机  准备回家

626
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,810
去买我自己的CD

627
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,690
午夜的时候

628
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,080
唱片终于发了

629
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,100
我当时在亨德森商店

630
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,910
23点59分  我们现在要去买唱片了

631
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,260
真的很激动

632
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,290
当时好多人在那里

633
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,000
都激动地尖叫

634
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,370
谢谢你们赶来支持

635
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,170
真的非常感谢

636
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,770
他们都在买唱片

637
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,900
我自己也有买

638
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,980
大伙都在这上倾注了无数心血

639
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,230
现在它终于发行了

640
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,130
当时真的很疯狂

641
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,860
商店里摆满自己的CD

642
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,640
大家从四面八方赶来

643
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,840
和我一起买

644
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,920
真的是很有趣的经历

645
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,170
永生难忘

646
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,910
我真的很爱你们

647
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,370
谢谢你们来到这里

648
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,350
第一时间收藏我的第二张专辑

649
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,980
晚安  我爱你们

650
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,170
现在我终于

651
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,170
终于不用再到处跑了

652
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,490
我躺在飞机上

653
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,460
这一天终于完了

654
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
这是我经历过的最长的一天

655
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,410
《Fearless》这张唱片出来以后

656
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,190
第一周就卖到了596000张

657
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,340
我真的高兴得不得了

658
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,380
还记得我第一张唱片出来的时候

659
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,630
首周卖到了39000张

660
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,950
就把我吓坏了

661
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,870
这次卖到了596000张

662
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,610
真的是个不小的飞跃

663
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,660
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car

664
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,760
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel

665
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,890
The other on my heart

666
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,030
I look around, turn the radio down

667
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,300
He says baby is something wrong

668
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:31,510
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song

669
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,940
And he says

670
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,190
Our song is the slamming screen door,

671
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,160
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window

672
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,270
When you're on the phone and you talk real slow

673
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,550
Cause it's late and your mama don't know

674
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,390
Our song is the way you laugh

675
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,890
The first date "man, I didn't kiss her, but I should have"

676
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,670
And when I got home ... before I said amen

677
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,280
Asking God if he could play it again

678
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,930
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything the day

679
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,670
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on

680
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,600
And lost and thrown away

681
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,380
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed

682
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,130
I almost didn't notice all the roses

683
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,370
And the note that said...

684
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,790
Cause our song is the slamming screen door

685
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,410
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window

686
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,850
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow

687
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,890
Cause it's late and his mama don't know

688
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,000
Our song is the way he laughs

689
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,470
The first date "man, I didn't kiss him, and I could have"

690
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,310
And when I got home, before I said amen

691
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:53,850
Asking God if he could play it again

692
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,800
i've heard every album, listened to the radio

693
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:14,100
waited for something to come along

694
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,000
that was as good as our song

695
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,060
cause our song is the slamming screen door

696
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,110
sneaking out late, tapping on his window

697
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,990
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow

698
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,420
cause it's late and his mama don't know

699
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,300
our song is the way he laughs

700
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,720
the first date "man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have"

701
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,000
and when i got home, before i said amen

702
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:13,560
asking god if he could play it again

703
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,250
play it again

704
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,990
i was riding shotgun with my hair undone

705
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,100
in the front seat of his car

706
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,820
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin

707
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,890
and i wrote down our song

708
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,940
