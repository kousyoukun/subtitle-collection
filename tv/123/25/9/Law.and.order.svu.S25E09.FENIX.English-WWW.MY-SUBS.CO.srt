00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:06,611
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:08,127
sexually based offenses

3
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:10,135
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,828
In New York City, the
dedicated detectives

5
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:14,707
who investigate these vicious felonies

6
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:16,092
are members of an elite squad

7
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:17,976
known as the Special Victims Unit.

8
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:19,446
These are their stories.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,859
I brushed my teeth.

10
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,608
You flossed?

11
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:30,572
- Yeah.
- That's a lie.

12
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:32,491
Mom, what are you doing?

13
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:35,421
I'm just getting rid of a
bunch of these old books.

14
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,000
We really need to give them away.

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,419
I don't want to.
I like 'em.

16
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:39,637
You like 'em?

17
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:42,358
Well, you want me to read you...

18
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:43,971
"Little Red Riding Hood"?

19
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:45,629
Because I'll do it right now.

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,602
Nah, that's okay.

21
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:49,383
Yeah, I didn't think so.

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,404
Okay. All right, honey.

23
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,638
So we'll go through the rest
of this stuff tomorrow, okay?

24
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,408
All right, sweetie.

25
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:58,392
Go to sleep.
Good night.

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,580
- Love you.
- Mom?

27
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:01,755
Yeah?

28
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:03,480
Whatever happened
to that girl?

29
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:04,982
What girl?

30
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:06,680
The one that got kidnapped,

31
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:08,652
the day of little Nicky's baptism,

32
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,155
Maddie.

33
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:11,989
How did you hear about her?

34
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,366
I googled you.

35
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,411
Wow, you googled me.

36
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:19,294
Yeah.

37
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:20,747
Well, what'd you find?

38
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:22,791
Is Maddie gonna be all right?

39
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,301
Well, honey,
she's home with her family.

40
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:28,390
And they're taking good care of her.

41
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:30,479
But I mean, that guy
who kidnapped her,

42
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:32,735
he's going to prison, right?

43
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,491
Yes, Noah, that's the plan.

44
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,138
Honey, you need to go to sleep.

45
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,975
You don't need to be
thinking about those things.

46
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,707
Go to sleep.

47
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:44,189
Mom?

48
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,668
Yeah, sweetie?

49
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,275
Why are there so many
bad guys in the world?

50
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,200
So...

51
00:01:57,168 --> 00:02:01,038
You found some other
articles about me?

52
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,162
Only what was
on the first page.

53
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:05,514
And what'd you find?

54
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:08,501
An article about William Lewis...

55
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:17,560
And Johnny D.

56
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,536
Ugh!

57
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:23,619
- He has a gun!
- Stay back!

58
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:25,012
Drop the gun.
Let her go.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,536
He's a bad guy, right?

60
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:31,789
Um...

61
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,682
Yes.

62
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,240
I mean, he was, Noah.

63
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:36,849
He's...

64
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,687
He's dead now.

65
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:45,082
I saw on the paperwork
he's listed as my father.

66
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,796
Well, you know, um...

67
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:54,828
You know, um,
biologically...

68
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:57,834
Yes.

69
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:59,281
But...

70
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:02,768
You know...
I, um...

71
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,234
How did you even find these?

72
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,402
Did you...
Did you go searching,

73
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:10,232
into my private boxes in the closet?

74
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,320
Are you mad?

75
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:15,323
Well, you know, it's
an invasion of privacy.

76
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:18,949
And, I really wish
you would have asked me.

77
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,297
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,765
I understand that
you have big questions.

79
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,872
I mean, these are big,
important questions.

80
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:29,598
And I want to have all
these conversations with you.

81
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,341
You know, honey, there's a time
and a place to have them.

82
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:35,945
And my job as your mom
is to...

83
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:40,348
Decide when, we should have
those conversations, right?

84
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,494
And this is...

85
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,807
This is not how we do it.

86
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:51,620
Is it really that scary?

87
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,496
You know, Noah, it's not.

88
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:02,546
It's just complicated.

89
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,721
Come here, honey.

90
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:12,421
I think I would like you
to read me that story.

91
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:17,525
Oh, I can do that.

92
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,826
Why don't you scoot over
and turn the light on, honey.

93
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,052
Okay.

94
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:39,712
So once upon a time,
there lived a country girl,

95
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,628
the prettiest creature
who was ever seen.

96
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,717
And her mother was fond of her,

97
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:49,469
but, her grandmother
doted on her even more.

98
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:55,597
Her grandmother made
a little red hood for her.

99
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:58,513
And she wore it
so well and so much

100
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:02,582
that everyone called her
Little Red Riding Hood.

101
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:04,519
That movie sucked.

102
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:06,224
Yeah, it was boring,
but I'd watch anything

103
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,218
with Jacob Elordi in it.

104
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:11,439
Okay, Rosie, I told you not
to spray that crap around me.

105
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,659
Because your mom's a sommelier?

106
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:15,799
Yeah, and she can't
be around strong scents.

107
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:17,227
It messes with your palate.

108
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:19,486
She's gonna be pissed enough
that I'm late.

109
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,979
I thought you told her
you were staying over tonight.

110
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:23,066
I did.

111
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,365
Well, then I can do this.

112
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:25,601
Okay, you're evil.

113
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:28,119
Hey, give it back.

114
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,623
Give it back!
Give it back!

115
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,244
Hey, girls.

116
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:35,376
How's it going?

117
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,639
Wanna smoke a joint with us?

118
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,113
Yo!

119
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:43,773
You think you can just ignore us?

120
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:44,928
Hey, girls.

121
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,352
Got something for you.

122
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:47,744
Hope you brought a microscope.

123
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,172
You're gonna regret that.

124
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:51,148
Hey, I didn't give you
permission to leave.

125
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,394
Hey!

126
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,273
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing?

127
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,884
What are you two gonna
do about it?

128
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,226
No!

129
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,691
Rosie!

130
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,020
From that moment forward,

131
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,490
Little Red Riding Hood
never left the path

132
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:08,034
or went into the woods again.

133
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,980
Was that a happy ending?

134
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:19,254
You know, Noah,
sometimes...

135
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,596
I'm not so sure.

136
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm never, ever gonna
go through the box

137
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,098
in the closet again.

138
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,653
We'll talk tomorrow.

139
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,004
Good night.
Love you.

140
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,617
I love you too.

141
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,205
Rosie!

142
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,212
So Noah googled you,

143
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,281
and then read about a
few of your past cases?

144
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:22,460
Uh, yeah.

145
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:24,770
That's it, I'm getting rid
of the girls' computers...

146
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:27,424
There's nothing we can do
to stop this, Carisi.

147
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:30,469
At least he was honest
about it, you know?

148
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,081
It's not like...

149
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:33,343
Not like you got an OnlyFans account.

150
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,890
That would have
been easier to explain.

151
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,048
What?

152
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:42,389
He asked me about William Lewis.

153
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:45,209
And then he asked about Johnny D.

154
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,699
What'd you say?

155
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:49,860
After I stopped stuttering,

156
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,034
I told him that it was complicated.

157
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,142
That's a woeful understatement.

158
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,686
He just wants to know,

159
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:00,373
that Maddie's kidnapper
is going to prison.

160
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:02,460
So that's why you met me

161
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:04,201
for mediocre coffee
in the rain, huh?

162
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:05,360
He's a kid.

163
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:08,590
He still believes that bad
guys get what they deserve.

164
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,383
We're still working on that plea deal.

165
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,553
But?

166
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:16,075
But we lost our main witness.

167
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:18,600
The tree guy, the dendrophile, he...

168
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:20,894
He got beat to death at Rikers.

169
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,313
Well, it doesn't matter.

170
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:25,867
Maddie, is our best witness.

171
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:27,525
Maybe, but she's 15.

172
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:29,139
She was snatched from her parents.

173
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:30,802
She was forced to ingest fentanyl

174
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,114
the entire time she was in captivity.

175
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,972
So you're worried that
George Brouchard's lawyer

176
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,756
is gonna paint her
as an unreliable witness.

177
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,205
Why else would they
want this to go to trial?

178
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:42,957
So put me on the stand.

179
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,586
I'll rip 'em apart.

180
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,375
Okay.

181
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,516
Bruno, what do you got?

182
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,810
She still alive?

183
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,297
Okay.
I'm on my way.

184
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,517
Doesn't sound good.

185
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,005
A teenage girl was found unconscious

186
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,945
in Fort Tryon Park,

187
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:15,438
stripped naked,
with a belt around her neck.

188
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:20,524
I'm not due in court
till later this afternoon.

189
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,456
Well, I could use
an ADA riding shotgun.

190
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,756
<i>Widen the grid!</i>

191
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,237
We're looking for her wallet,
phone, jewelry.

192
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,368
On it, Detective.

193
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,544
- Who found her?
- Two local moms.

194
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:37,076
They covered the vic with their
coats until the bus arrived.

195
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:38,831
- It's pretty deserted up here.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,776
Few more hours, she would
have died of exposure.

197
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:41,951
Anyone know who the vic is?

198
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:43,126
No, we didn't find any ID on her.

199
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:44,431
We're checking Missing Persons.

200
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,468
And what about the perp?

201
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,782
TARU's pulling camera footage,

202
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:48,314
but it looks like multiple assailants

203
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,464
based on the injuries I saw

204
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,786
before the ambo hauled her away.

205
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:52,235
Multiple assailants.

206
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,919
So what, this some kind
of wolf pack thing?

207
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,435
It's pretty violent.

208
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:57,532
Ripped the clothes right off of her.

209
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,563
Drag marks from her boots.

210
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:03,961
They go all the way
down to the playground.

211
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:09,680
Vic was found here.

212
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:13,352
Those are pretty deep gouge marks.

213
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:16,412
Too deep for just a few kids playing.

214
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:21,983
Guys.

215
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,458
Guys.

216
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,228
Check this out, lip gloss.

217
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,338
Hey.
Hey!

218
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:30,739
I'm gonna need a photograph of this.

219
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,560
Someone was pressed
face down against it.

220
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,047
Was our vic wearing lip gloss?

221
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,345
Not that I noticed.

222
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,382
We might be looking for a second girl.

223
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:40,533
I'll get the dog,
see if we can pick up a scent.

224
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:43,962
Did our Jane Doe regain consciousness?

225
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,354
Still on a ventilator.

226
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:46,580
Okay, I understand there was

227
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,444
some kind of ligature
around her neck.

228
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,628
The women who found her
took this off her neck.

229
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,927
Caused some pretty
severe cerebral hypoxia.

230
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,189
Any other injuries?

231
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,148
Abrasions on her legs and back

232
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:57,722
and fingertip bruising on both wrists.

233
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,977
So she was held down?

234
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,769
Was there any other bruising?
Any tears?

235
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,607
From the extent of
her internal injuries,

236
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,601
I'd say multiple assailants.

237
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,726
Thank you, Doctor.

238
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:08,813
Doctor.

239
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:13,340
Um, what are the chances
that she doesn't make it?

240
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:16,544
I'd locate her next of kin as
soon as possible if I were you.

241
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,536
You doing all right?

242
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:29,666
Not really.

243
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:32,409
This job's hard enough
without our kids googling it.

244
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:34,712
We signed up for it.
They didn't.

245
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,067
Noah's a strong kid, Liv.

246
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:42,645
Is he strong enough to find out
that his father's a rapist?

247
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,548
You were.

248
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,247
Benson.

249
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,624
Thanks.

250
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:59,004
Uptown precinct just got a call
about a missing girl.

251
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,322
Let me guess,
matching her description.

252
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,098
That's her.

253
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:10,787
That's my Rosie.

254
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,661
Ms. James, please, take a...

255
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:15,003
Take a seat.

256
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,506
When was the last
time you spoke to Rosie?

257
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:22,848
She left me a voicemail
last night, checking in.

258
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:25,179
Was there a reason
that you didn't pick up?

259
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,804
I drank my Sleepytime Tea,

260
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,111
and I must have fell asleep
in my recliner.

261
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:32,100
You didn't discover
her missing until...

262
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,129
- Until this morning?
- I got up,

263
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,422
to fix Rosie breakfast,

264
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,442
and-and her room was empty.

265
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,853
Okay, and where are her parents?

266
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,261
Japan.

267
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:44,952
They're celebrating their
20th wedding anniversary.

268
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,492
Okay.

269
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:48,303
This is not your fault.

270
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,870
You know whose fault this is?

271
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,497
The guys who attacked her.

272
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,986
Anything you can tell us about her,

273
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,833
where she was,
who she was with,

274
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,270
would be so helpful.

275
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,272
She said she was going to a movie.

276
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:01,664
With someone you knew?

277
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,409
One of her girlfriends,

278
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:05,668
her best friend, Sydney.

279
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,264
They were supposed to have
a sleepover last night.

280
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,268
Okay, we're gonna need
to speak with Sydney's parents.

281
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:18,428
Yeah, it's Rosie Meadows,
my stepdaughter's best friend.

282
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:20,560
When was the last time
you spoke to your stepdaughter?

283
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:21,924
Last night, she said she was

284
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,643
gonna spend the night at Rosie's.

285
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:25,340
Why, did something happen to them?

286
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:26,479
We're sorry to tell you this,

287
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,223
but Rosie was attacked last night.

288
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:30,128
Attacked how?

289
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:31,956
She was sexually assaulted.

290
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:33,530
There's no easy way
to say this, Ms. Lynch,

291
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:34,871
but she's in bad shape.

292
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:38,127
Oh, my God,
w-where is Sydney right now?

293
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:40,877
Oh, my, is she at the
hospital with Rosie?

294
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,533
- Mrs. Lynch...
- I have to get a cab,

295
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,359
unless you could drive me.

296
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:45,882
My hands are shaking.

297
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,928
I couldn't...
I couldn't drive if I tried.

298
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:51,891
Mrs. Lynch, your stepdaughter
is not at the hospital.

299
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,468
What do you mean?
Where is she?

300
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:58,460
Oh, it's...
It's Sydney.

301
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,066
Pick it up.

302
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,235
Sydney, where are you?

303
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:04,379
What?
What do you...

304
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:06,164
she says her phone's almost dead.

305
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:07,425
What do you mean
your phone's almost dead?

306
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,818
Can't you borrow a charger?

307
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:10,864
Give it to me, please.
Okay, Sydney?

308
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:12,822
- Yes?
- This is Captain Benson.

309
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,484
Can you tell me where you are, honey?

310
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,261
I-I'm at a friend's house.

311
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:17,653
- Rosie's?
- No. No.

312
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:19,561
Um, Rosie and I got into a fight.

313
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:20,954
Another friend.

314
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,047
Okay.
Can you tell me her name?

315
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:24,668
Can you tell me the address?

316
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,619
We'd like to come pick you up now.

317
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:28,261
Um...

318
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:30,413
I'm fine.
I just... I...

319
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:31,798
I have... I have to go.

320
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:34,366
Um, my phone's
run out of juice.

321
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:35,541
I'll call back later.

322
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,195
Sydney, hold...

323
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,423
She says she's fine,

324
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,109
and at a friend's house.

325
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,612
Your stepdaughter is lying,
Mrs. Lynch.

326
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,502
Hey, where are we
on tracking the location

327
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,570
of Sydney's cell phone?

328
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,457
TARU's trying to get
a ping on it now.

329
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,305
- Is that the crime scene?
- Yeah.

330
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,389
Well, did we get any DNA,

331
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:01,532
- fingerprints?
- Yeah.

332
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:02,920
Denise Lynch confirms

333
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,924
that the lip gloss
that Curry found,

334
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:07,094
same shade Sydney
Lynch wears every day.

335
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:09,191
We got pretty deep
gouge marks on the topsoil,

336
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,098
but, no ID possible on footprints.

337
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:13,057
Why not?
I heard there were lots.

338
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,407
Well, the topsoil's got
a lot of peat.

339
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,634
It's not the best medium
for forensic impressions.

340
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,765
What about Rosie's clothes?

341
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:19,984
Did we get anything from her kit?

342
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,240
Yeah, semen,
from four different men.

343
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:23,719
Four guys?

344
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,156
Any matches in the system?

345
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,115
- No.
- But DNA methylation's become

346
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,993
a lot more reliable
since you were a cop.

347
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:34,085
You're telling me
the lab got the ages

348
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:35,557
of the perps from their sperm?

349
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:36,913
Pretty much.

350
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,610
Forensics guy at the lab can
place all four assailants

351
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,834
in their mid-to late teens.

352
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,797
Straight to voicemail every time.

353
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,562
Sydney's not a liar.

354
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,790
What if her phone's really dead?

355
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,180
I heard distress
in her voice, Mrs. Lynch.

356
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,708
Where is she?

357
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,101
We don't know yet.

358
00:16:57,144 --> 00:17:00,750
But, we do need a list
of friends, boyfriends.

359
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,584
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

360
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:03,803
Okay.

361
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:06,625
Is Sydney's father
still in your lives?

362
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:11,242
He died six months ago in a car crash.

363
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,206
Her mom's not in the picture.

364
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,702
I'm so sorry to hear that.

365
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,905
It's just the two of us,
me and Sydney.

366
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,291
How well do you know Rosie Meadows?

367
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,650
Her parents seem like
they have a lot of money.

368
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:29,141
Did Sydney ever mention
any tension in the family?

369
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:30,378
They're out of town a lot.

370
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:32,230
I mean, she's raised
mostly by her nanny.

371
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:35,051
So Rosie never mentioned
a handful

372
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,271
of slightly older boys?

373
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:38,683
No.

374
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:42,728
I mean, they're teen girls.

375
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,504
They communicate in ways
I don't really understand.

376
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,803
- Right.
- TikTok, Snapchat.

377
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,291
We already checked her social media.

378
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:50,980
We just wanted to make sure

379
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:52,899
that we're not missing anything.

380
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,286
Why would they just
let her call like that

381
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:58,327
if she was taken?

382
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:02,296
Well, it could be
a number of reasons.

383
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:03,855
Most likely of which,

384
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,981
is that they want us
to stop looking for her.

385
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:09,445
But you're not gonna do that...

386
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,716
Are you?

387
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:13,603
No.

388
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:16,304
No, I'm not.

389
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:18,842
What about the security
cameras in the park?

390
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,096
This alleged wolf pack?

391
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,186
We only got one guy on the cams.

392
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:26,494
So he comes up behind her,
puts Rosie in a headlock.

393
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,858
Pulls her away
from her best friend Sydney.

394
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,542
Takes her out of the light,

395
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,168
towards the playground, presumably.

396
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:33,254
Right.

397
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,239
She's paralyzed with fear.

398
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,402
Doesn't want to leave her friend.

399
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:40,073
My guess,
she interrupted the rape,

400
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:41,551
and one of the guys held her down.

401
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,896
- Explains the lip gloss on the slide.
- Right.

402
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,217
And what about the security
cams from the park exits?

403
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:47,871
I mean, if these guys

404
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:49,351
know the park as well
as they seem to,

405
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,440
they probably just took Sydney
off the main path,

406
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,507
into the woods,
and over the fence, right?

407
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,218
TARU got a hit
on Sydney's cell phone.

408
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:59,556
So we looked at your
daughter's online presence.

409
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:02,246
But without her passwords,
we can't go much further.

410
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:04,258
I have her passwords
written down at home.

411
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,437
Liv, we have something.

412
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:09,885
Last ping off a tower
from Sydney's phone

413
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,286
was from about two blocks away

414
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,722
from a yacht club on City Island.

415
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:14,854
So her phone is either off
or completely dead.

416
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,864
Or these guys destroyed it.

417
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,503
I know this marina.

418
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:20,120
There's gotta be a
hundred slips there.

419
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,644
This time of year,
people shrink-wrap

420
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,752
their boats and dry-dock them.

421
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,212
Everything covered
in plastic for winter

422
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,111
- is a good place to hide.
- Yeah, we're gonna need backup.

423
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:27,599
I'll call 1PP on the way,

424
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:28,918
but we're not waiting.

425
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:32,548
Guys, we are gonna search every
single boat if we have to.

426
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,298
We're gonna find this girl.

427
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:38,969
All right,
you two take down there.

428
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:41,054
It's been a while since
I wore one of these things.

429
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,563
Well, it suits you, counselor.

430
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:43,906
I'd feel a lot better if I had a gun.

431
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,900
Yeah.
Well, that would be illegal.

432
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,011
Okay.

433
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,515
Let's open these up.

434
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,663
Clear!

435
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,240
Clear!

436
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:57,655
Clear!

437
00:19:57,969 --> 00:19:59,263
<i>Clear up ahead!</i>

438
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:00,396
Clear!

439
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,053
Clear!

440
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,261
Sydney?

441
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,435
Hey.

442
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,243
I'm gonna find this girl.

443
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,304
Clear!

444
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,039
Captain!

445
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,227
The dogs found a scent.
Come on.

446
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,271
- What do you got?
- She was here in the cabin.

447
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,204
Okay.

448
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:48,609
They brought her here
and did God knows what.

449
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:51,335
Captain, her phone.

450
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,341
Find me the owner of this boat.

451
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:58,697
Already checking registration.

452
00:20:58,733 --> 00:20:59,908
Excellent.

453
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:01,475
And get CSU down here.

454
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,305
I want every inch
of this cabin processed.

455
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:36,771
That's not Sydney's.

456
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,588
How do you know it's even a girl's?

457
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,955
We don't.

458
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:43,226
But we did find Sydney's
cell phone on the boat,

459
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,214
and her DNA.

460
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:46,346
Does that mean blood?

461
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,435
It's touch DNA.
It's not from blood.

462
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,459
It's from someplace that she touched.

463
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,353
What did they do to her?

464
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:57,052
There's no indication
of life-threatening harm.

465
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:58,402
So?

466
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:00,411
So right now we have
every reason to believe

467
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:02,754
that Sydney is still alive.

468
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:13,939
So did we get anything on the boat?

469
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:15,470
Did we make contact with the owner?

470
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,464
Yeah.
Retired insurance adjuster.

471
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:18,995
No records.
Says he hasn't even been

472
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,467
out on the water
in over a year.

473
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:21,599
Marina confirmed.

474
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,467
Not to mention the state of his boat.

475
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,646
Forensics?

476
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,735
Fresh prints and DNA,
four sets,

477
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,890
and it is a match
with Rosie's rape kit.

478
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:32,131
Oh, this just came in,

479
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,310
security cam footage
from the marina entrance.

480
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,508
There's our wolf pack.

481
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:41,017
Yeah, they all seem like
they know each other.

482
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:43,142
Do we have any evidence that they knew

483
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,499
the two girls that they targeted?

484
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,754
I ruled out every boy
that Sydney and Rosie

485
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,974
had contact with...
phones, social media.

486
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:51,203
So this is what,
just totally random?

487
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:53,039
- It was deliberate.
- No.

488
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:55,023
I think they were
hanging out in that park

489
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,982
just waiting for
someone to come along.

490
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:59,027
So some kind
of gang initiation?

491
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:00,863
There's not a lot
of white gangs in the city.

492
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,030
Albanian maybe, but...

493
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:03,387
Yeah, but it doesn't
even matter

494
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,731
because there's no prints
or DNA in the system.

495
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:08,300
I doubt these are
first-time offenders.

496
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:11,692
So check local precincts for
muggings, robberies, assaults,

497
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:14,042
involving four young, white males.

498
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:15,352
On it, Captain.

499
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,966
These guys look like
they're still in high school.

500
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah, I bet they don't have

501
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,317
perfect attendance records, either.

502
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:21,971
I'll check schools
for truancy reports.

503
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,612
You know what, check
student body psych visits.

504
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,281
After what they did to Rosie...

505
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:29,065
I'm sure a pet or two has gone missing

506
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:31,379
from their neighborhood.

507
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,934
Rosie's parents are at the hospital.

508
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:42,047
That's Rosie's.

509
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,089
Red's her favorite color.

510
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:45,424
Where did you find this?

511
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,927
We found it on a boat
in a marina on City Island.

512
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,346
W-what would she be doing there?

513
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:53,719
Well, she wasn't there,
but her hoodie was.

514
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,810
- Why?
- It's just hard to understand, but,

515
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,378
it's possible the boys took
this as some kind of souvenir.

516
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:02,025
Either way,
Rosie didn't have it on

517
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,876
when we found her in the park.

518
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,694
She must have been cold.

519
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:07,625
Okay, you said that Rosie was with

520
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:08,884
her best friend last night.

521
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,286
Yes.

522
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:12,372
Sydney Lynch.
Do you know her?

523
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,268
- Vaguely...
- Of course we know her.

524
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:16,598
- Where is she?
- Unfortunately, she's still missing.

525
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:19,298
We believe that after
your daughter was attacked,

526
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:21,312
that the boys took her.

527
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:23,068
And you haven't found them yet?

528
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,679
We're doing everything that we can.

529
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,776
How much?
How much?

530
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:30,126
We can put up the ransom, any amount.

531
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:31,519
- You tell us how much.
- Mr. Meadows,

532
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,390
we don't think that this
was financially motivated.

533
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:36,141
We haven't received
any kind of requests like that.

534
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:37,618
So then what do they want?

535
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,091
This is difficult to wrap
your head around, but,

536
00:24:40,484 --> 00:24:42,174
some people just want
to cause pain.

537
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:43,610
What?

538
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:45,150
They're just wild animals?

539
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:47,277
I wish it were that simple.

540
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:51,739
Our daughter may never recover.

541
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:58,625
We are so incredibly sorry.

542
00:24:58,669 --> 00:24:59,887
And we want you to know

543
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,021
that this is NYPD's highest priority.

544
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:05,378
And every cop in this city
is looking for those boys.

545
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:06,982
And when we do find them,

546
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,757
they'll do life in prison.

547
00:25:11,452 --> 00:25:12,932
Excuse me.

548
00:25:16,008 --> 00:25:17,078
Hey.

549
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:18,863
Local precinct just got a call.

550
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:20,306
A neighbor in an
apartment building saw

551
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:22,395
something suspicious
at a townhouse next door.

552
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:23,563
Suspicious how?

553
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:24,702
Well, the place is under construction.

554
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, so it should be empty.

555
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:28,002
Yeah, but a young girl
was out on the roof.

556
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:29,656
And she was out in the rain.

557
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,238
Neighbor took a pic.

558
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:34,356
That could be Sydney.

559
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,706
Precinct sent a uni.

560
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:37,011
Nobody answered the door.

561
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:39,021
Velasco and Curry are
on the scene canvassing.

562
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:41,189
Call ESU and hostage negotiation.

563
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:42,677
I'll hang back with the Meadows.

564
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,192
Okay.
Let's go.

565
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,556
Do we have any idea
who's in that townhouse?

566
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,079
Tough to see with the window covered.

567
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:56,727
But our infrared shows
four males and one female,

568
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,361
who I'm assuming is the hostage.

569
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:00,042
Make sure your snipers know that.

570
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,819
Better yet,
tell them to stand down.

571
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,480
If they see a clear shot
at one of these guys,

572
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,656
- they're taking it.
- You gotta make contact first.

573
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:08,782
Look, your scene, my case.

574
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:10,456
Are we clear?

575
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:14,722
- You run the townhouse?
- Yeah.

576
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,319
Owner's putting it on the market,

577
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:18,400
pending renovation and pest control.

578
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,453
Velasco said the pest
company had a set of keys.

579
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:22,194
You get anything
from the exterminator?

580
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,456
She has an 18-year-old son

581
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:25,292
who hasn't been home in two days.

582
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,416
Ma'am, I'm Captain Benson,
NYPD.

583
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,940
Mona Piper.

584
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,253
Your detective seems to think

585
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:38,733
that my son might
be involved with this.

586
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,058
Does your son have access
to your office?

587
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,852
Seth tries to be a good boy.

588
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,389
He tries?

589
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:47,606
He helps out sometimes, but...

590
00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:49,773
He's different.

591
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,110
He always has been.

592
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:52,945
Mona, listen to me.

593
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,601
So if you want
to protect your son,

594
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:59,615
I'm going to tell you
the best way to do it, okay?

595
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,574
- I'm listening.
- Okay.

596
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,464
You see those men up there?

597
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,508
Those men getting into position?

598
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:10,546
Those are the best-trained
men in the world

599
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:15,384
at putting .30-cal Win Mags
into human brains.

600
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,350
So if you care
about your son's life,

601
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:22,057
I suggest you call him right now.

602
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:23,509
Yeah.

603
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:32,288
Seth, it's Mom.

604
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,817
Seth?

605
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:40,709
This is Captain Benson, NYPD.

606
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,877
Oh, my mom told you
where to find us, huh?

607
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,887
No, your mom loves you,
but, she's worried about you.

608
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,276
- Why is that?
- Well, I think that she knows

609
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:51,359
that you haven't had an easy go of it.

610
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,131
Maybe you're a little different.

611
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:57,151
I think maybe she was talking
about your lack of empathy.

612
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:59,806
You know, it's not like
you just woke up one morning

613
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,940
and decided to assault a girl
with your friends

614
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:06,030
and kidnap her and put her
in a townhouse, right?

615
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,444
Seth, you know what I think?

616
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:13,559
I think that it started
first with, like...

617
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,866
With bugs, right?

618
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:17,529
And rats.

619
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:19,043
Huh?

620
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:21,959
Mostly rats.

621
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,619
Rats.

622
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,182
Right.

623
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,915
Maybe even when you were really young?

624
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,969
When did you start helping
your mom out at the office?

625
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,492
Ten.

626
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:35,102
You know, in my experience,

627
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,800
boys like you, you know,
they start out with animals.

628
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:41,261
And then, Seth,
you know what happens?

629
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:44,264
They slowly become one.

630
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,559
I'm not an animal.

631
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,311
Are you sure?

632
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,356
- Yes.
- Prove it.

633
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:54,382
Where's Sydney?
Let me talk to her.

634
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,610
I want to hear her voice.

635
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,517
She's right here.

636
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,301
Okay, well,
let me talk to her.

637
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:01,520
- Seth, man...
- Shut up.

638
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:02,666
- What are we doing?
- Shut up.

639
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:04,182
- What is going on?
- Shut up!

640
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,708
You tell her you're okay,

641
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:14,881
or you end up just like your friend.

642
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,733
Okay?

643
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:19,925
Here she is.

644
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,671
<i>Hi, honey.
This is Captain Benson.</i>

645
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:23,890
<i>How are you doing?</i>

646
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:25,972
I'm so sorry.
I'm...

647
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:28,040
- I'm fine.
<i>- You're fine?</i>

648
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,164
It's okay if you're not, honey.

649
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,419
- It's okay if you're not fine.
- <i>I'm good.</i>

650
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,813
I-I want to be here.
I want to be here.

651
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,233
Okay, honey, I understand.
I understand.

652
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,485
Please don't come in.
Please.

653
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:40,994
That's it.
That's it.

654
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:42,190
Satisfied?

655
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,991
You can end this right now.

656
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,830
All you have to do
is walk out that door.

657
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,200
Nah, I think it's
a little too late for me.

658
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:51,962
<i>No, it's not.
Listen to me.</i>

659
00:29:52,005 --> 00:29:55,877
You have the power,
to make a choice.

660
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:59,965
Are you a man, Seth,
or are you an animal?

661
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:04,217
Animals are weak.

662
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:05,692
Are you?

663
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,107
No.

664
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,559
Well, then I think you know
what your next step is.

665
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:19,377
My mom out there?

666
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:21,373
Seth, I see you looking out.

667
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:24,838
<i>But my snipers don't.</i>

668
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,699
<i>I could tell them
where you are,</i>

669
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:29,137
<i>and they could take
a clean shot,</i>

670
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:30,914
but I'm not gonna do that.

671
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:38,269
Why not?

672
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:42,490
Because we're talking
about choices, Seth.

673
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,760
We're talking about choices.

674
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:48,627
<i>It's not that hard to ignore</i>

675
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,718
the animal parts of yourself.

676
00:30:58,202 --> 00:30:59,941
I want my mom to leave.

677
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:02,989
I don't want her to
see me get arrested.

678
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:04,488
Okay.

679
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:09,778
Okay.

680
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:11,827
You're in charge.

681
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:26,627
Hold your fire!

682
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:28,929
The scene is secured.
No shots fired.

683
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,329
Tell me about the girl
as soon as possible.

684
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:33,157
Unhurt.
They're bringing her out now.

685
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:46,029
Carisi...

686
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,866
We're all good.
Sydney's alive.

687
00:31:47,903 --> 00:31:49,905
I wish I had better news.

688
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:54,601
The Meadows just had
Rosie taken off life support.

689
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:08,009
I want him in my car.

690
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,762
- What?
- Do it.

691
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,682
- Captain...
- Do it!

692
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:19,500
- I'll take him.
- Yes, sir.

693
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,370
Velasco, you're with me.

694
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:44,917
<i>What are we doing here?</i>

695
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,100
You're asking me a question

696
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,051
that you already know the answer to.

697
00:32:49,226 --> 00:32:50,930
You said we were
going to the precinct.

698
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,679
Well, I guess she lied.

699
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,103
Get out.

700
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:58,329
- What are you gonna do to me?
- I'll tell you

701
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:00,395
what I'm not gonna
do is ask you again.

702
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:15,310
So right after you came
out of the townhouse,

703
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,385
I got a call from the hospital.

704
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,081
It was not a good call.

705
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:23,460
The girl that you attacked,
Rosie...

706
00:33:24,123 --> 00:33:25,864
She was brain-dead.

707
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:29,178
Her parents just
decided to pull the plug.

708
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:31,467
You're going down for murder.

709
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,314
They killed her, not me.

710
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,616
Do you know what
a forensic reenactment is?

711
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:39,885
No.

712
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:42,234
So we're going to recreate

713
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,847
what happened last night
when you raped Rosie.

714
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,235
Stations of the cross.

715
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:50,153
Ah.

716
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:53,532
- Is that where you dragged her from?
- No.

717
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,212
How'd you move her
to the playground?

718
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:57,494
I didn't.
It was the other three guys.

719
00:33:57,772 --> 00:33:59,992
Well, no one carried her
because...

720
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:02,165
I saw the drag marks.

721
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:04,751
Only one person moved her.

722
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:07,796
You're just doing this
to mess with my head.

723
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:10,002
What, you got a hearing issue?

724
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:12,657
Like we said, it's a reenactment.

725
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,224
Let's see.

726
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:17,482
Let's try to recreate
those drag marks.

727
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:23,935
So is this where you raped Rosie,

728
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:25,337
and then you beat her,

729
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,424
till she was unconscious?

730
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:29,043
I'm sorry.

731
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,194
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

732
00:34:32,981 --> 00:34:36,741
You ended her story last night.

733
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:38,342
What do you want from me?

734
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:39,597
The full story.

735
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,997
Of what you did to Sydney.

736
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:43,811
Here...

737
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,357
On the boat...

738
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:48,599
In the townhouse...

739
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:53,198
But not from this pathetic,

740
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:57,049
little insect.

741
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:01,091
I thought you wanted
a forensic reenactment.

742
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:03,059
I changed my mind.

743
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,177
It's her story to tell.

744
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:13,589
Put him back in the car.

745
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:19,731
I saw them dragging her by the neck,

746
00:35:20,005 --> 00:35:21,276
the one with the long hair

747
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:22,519
- and the eyes.
- And then what?

748
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,396
And then the other
three jumped on her,

749
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,273
held her down. I'd never seen anything

750
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:28,255
violent like that, not in real life.

751
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,038
You couldn't call 911?

752
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,567
Mom, I was...
I was terrified.

753
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,802
She froze, Mrs. Lynch.

754
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,567
It's called tonic immobility.

755
00:35:36,712 --> 00:35:39,498
And it's a normal response
to a predatory attack.

756
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:42,057
After a moment of that, I...

757
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,469
I actually, I ran towards them.

758
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:47,354
I tried to help Rosie,
but, I just...

759
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:48,443
I couldn't.

760
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,719
We have reason to believe
that at least one of them

761
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:52,931
held you face down onto the slide.

762
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:55,469
But then you managed to get away.

763
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,066
I ran.

764
00:35:58,255 --> 00:35:59,720
I feel so guilty.

765
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,077
No, no, no, no, Sydney,
listen to me.

766
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:05,900
There was nothing more
you could have done.

767
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:08,076
You did everything right.

768
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:10,418
You saved yourself.

769
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:13,004
You did everything right.

770
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:20,219
I looked into Rosie's eyes
as they tore her clothes off.

771
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,180
When you ran away,

772
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:24,658
when did they catch up to you?

773
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,574
I... I got... I got lost.

774
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,461
I must have ran to...

775
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,708
I must have made a big circle because,

776
00:36:31,884 --> 00:36:33,858
I ran right into them.

777
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:36,375
You remember what happened next?

778
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,543
Seth, he put me in a headlock,

779
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:42,720
and he choked me
until I passed out.

780
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,809
Do you remember calling me?

781
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,122
Yeah.
Um...

782
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:51,250
I woke up in some sort of boat,

783
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:53,461
and they forced me to call you.

784
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,548
Because they didn't want us
to keep looking for her.

785
00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:59,050
But we didn't stop, honey.

786
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:04,139
I would never stop.

787
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:06,874
You hear me?
I would never stop.

788
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,482
So...

789
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,235
Sydney...

790
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,109
I hate to ask you this,
and I know it's uncomfortable,

791
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:27,660
but, I need you to tell me exactly...

792
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:30,582
What they did to you,

793
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:33,336
when you were held captive.

794
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,239
They, um...
They were p...

795
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:40,091
Playing with me...

796
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:43,803
Taking my clothes off...

797
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,850
Moving my arms and my legs...

798
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,337
Making me do things.
I just...

799
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:00,040
I just closed my eyes,

800
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,072
and pretended it was all a dream.

801
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:11,163
You get a confession
out of Seth?

802
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,382
Eh, you could call it that.

803
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:13,641
He talked a lot about you.

804
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:14,964
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

805
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,335
Evidently, you scared him.

806
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:17,597
- He said that?
- Yeah.

807
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,954
And he also claims
the sexual assaults

808
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,992
against Rosie and Sydney
were consensual.

809
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,425
Consensual?

810
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,230
Oh, the beating, the choking,
the torture,

811
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:27,390
the murder.

812
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:28,782
He blamed the other three.

813
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:30,661
Then the other three
all blamed each other

814
00:38:30,697 --> 00:38:32,143
before they lawyered up.

815
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,918
So much for sticking together.

816
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:35,572
Hey, can I, uh,

817
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:37,530
can I talk to you alone for a second?

818
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,344
You know...

819
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:50,227
Seth's lawyer's gonna have
a strong claim of coercion

820
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:52,330
- if this goes to trial.
- Let him try.

821
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:54,144
I'm ready.

822
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:57,898
- This a bad time?
- No.

823
00:38:57,942 --> 00:39:00,597
I just heard back
from Nassau County SVU.

824
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,131
DNA from our four perps

825
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:04,178
is a match for half a dozen unsolved

826
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:05,479
wolf pack rapes on Long Island.

827
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:07,762
- Are the victims willing to testify?
- They are.

828
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:09,170
Counselor?

829
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:10,798
I will talk to the DA.

830
00:39:10,954 --> 00:39:13,232
Due in his office anyway
about George Brouchard.

831
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:14,846
Good luck.

832
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,050
What?

833
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,401
You're lucky
I'm not in IAB anymore.

834
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,426
Captain Curry,

835
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:26,197
I am going home to my son,

836
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,452
and I suggest you do the same.

837
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,602
Hey.

838
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,299
You feel like some company?

839
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:52,649
Sure.

840
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,414
Whoa.

841
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:01,190
Mom, is that
what I think it is?

842
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,501
Yeah.

843
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,070
Yeah.

844
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,824
So, um.

845
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:12,243
How much do you know?

846
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:15,371
Not much, just the names...

847
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:18,405
Yours, mine,

848
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:21,169
and, my biological father.

849
00:40:22,374 --> 00:40:24,505
So are you in the mood

850
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,560
to hear the beginning of your story?

851
00:40:28,685 --> 00:40:30,751
What kind of story is it?

852
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:33,651
Well, that sort of depends

853
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:35,703
where the story ends, doesn't it?

854
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,728
Ours ends in a happy place,

855
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,481
you and me right here.

856
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:47,965
And you know what they say
about endings, don't you?

857
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,401
What?

858
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,138
Every one...

859
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:53,377
Is a new beginning.

860
00:41:11,565 --> 00:41:13,282
So one day,

861
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,247
there was this beautiful woman,

862
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,561
named Ellie...
