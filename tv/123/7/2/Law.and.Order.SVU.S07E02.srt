1
00:00:00,814 --> 00:00:02,588
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:02,588 --> 00:00:06,318
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:07,554
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:11,094
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,157
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:16,038
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,749
My name's Ed

8
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:21,877
and I'm here to listen to
your problems with empathy,

9
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:24,715
without judgment or advise.

10
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:25,887
Go away.

11
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:26,902
I care about you,

12
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,358
- and I'm sure many others do, too.
- Please leave me alone!

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy.

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,350
There's got to be a lot of
folks that would miss you.

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,019
No, no one.

16
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,120
What about the baby's father?

17
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,406
You don't understand.

18
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:48,346
I was raped!

19
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:50,113
- Name?
- We never got that far.

20
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:51,000
Is this her room?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,610
No, she came in here
when the maid was cleaning.

22
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,752
I don't even think
she was staying here.

23
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,532
I need everybody out now.

24
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,544
It's cold out here.

25
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,686
I brought you something to drink.

26
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:10,269
- I can't drink coffee.
- It's just cocoa, okay?

27
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,028
Why don't you take it?
It'll warm up your hands.

28
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,816
I'm just gonna put it
right there, okay?

29
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,226
Here you go.

30
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,215
Thanks.

31
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,202
I'm Olivia.

32
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,559
April.

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,876
What's going on, April?

34
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:40,948
April, have you picked out
a name for your baby?

35
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:44,138
Sarah.

36
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:47,958
Sarah was my mom's name.

37
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,335
She died last year.

38
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:52,563
Breast cancer.

39
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:58,241
The security guard told you?

40
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:59,739
Yes.

41
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:04,270
That's why I'm here.
I'm from the special victims unit.

42
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:08,448
What if I can't love my baby?

43
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:11,879
- My baby...
- You chose to keep your baby.

44
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,875
You gave her a beautiful name.
You already love your baby.

45
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,367
- I can't, I can't do this alone.
- Well, you don't have to.

46
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,456
I want you to listen to me.

47
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm gonna help you.

48
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:28,422
I promise you,
I will help you. / How?

49
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:31,852
We're gonna figure it out together.
Now, will you give me your hand?

50
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:37,851
No!

51
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,151
It's okay. It's okay.

52
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:48,483
No.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2005/09/27
DVD sync by JEREMY 2009

67
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:39,024
Patient presented as depressed
and tearful upon arrival.

68
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,315
Her name's April. April Troost.

69
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:43,014
Ran a tox screen on her as well as
a blood alcohol. Both negative.

70
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,111
What about the pregnancy?

71
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:45,884
She's approximately 35 weeks.

72
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,856
No sign of distress or malnutrition.

73
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:49,512
- She's good to go.
- You mean give birth.

74
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:51,937
No. I mean I'm releasing her.

75
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:52,950
Uh, maybe you missed the part

76
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,239
where she was gonna take a swan dive
off a 20-story building.

77
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,935
Her suicidal ideation has passed,

78
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,559
and she has no history
of prior attempts.

79
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:01,328
Well, can you guarantee that
she's not gonna climb out
on the ledge tomorrow?

80
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,412
No, of course not.

81
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:04,549
Then put her on a psych hold
until the baby is born.

82
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:05,669
I can't do that.

83
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,165
She's not acutely psychotic
or a danger to herself or others.

84
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,306
Hey. Hey!

85
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:12,819
The baby, baby doesn't count?

86
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,152
Look, she agreed
to outpatient counseling.

87
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:17,011
My job's done.

88
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:22,902
I thought I was dealing with the rape.

89
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,312
Until yesterday.

90
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,860
I just snapped.

91
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,550
That happens.

92
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,615
You're not the first person
to go through this.

93
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:37,921
Everywhere I look,
I see his face.

94
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:42,038
- Even when I close my eyes.
- Why don't you tell me about him.

95
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:48,181
We met at a bar
and talked all night.

96
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:54,115
He offered to walk me home,
and I thought...

97
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:57,284
finally, a gentleman.

98
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,590
Went to my apartment.

99
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,044
And I remember praying,
"please kiss me good night."

100
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:08,105
It'd been so long.

101
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,823
That's when he shoved me in
and locked the door.

102
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,882
Why didn't you call the police?

103
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,734
I was a fool.

104
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:22,097
I actually believed
that he was interested in me.

105
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:25,767
A nurse's aide.
I barely have my GED.

106
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:30,079
April, what happened to you
wasn't your fault.

107
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:35,476
Facing him is gonna help you
deal with this.

108
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:37,610
I can't.

109
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,962
You gotta be strong for little Sarah.

110
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:42,157
You're all she has.

111
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:45,451
And I promise I will help you.

112
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,805
How?

113
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:52,368
By arresting the man that raped you.

114
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,239
Tell me his name.

115
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:04,183
Barclay Pallister.

116
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,335
Pallister Labs
43 West 37th Street
Wednesday, March 2

117
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:10,470
You expect me to remember a woman
I met in a bar eight months ago.

118
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,902
You drank, you laughed,
one thing led to another.

119
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:14,746
Maybe I'd remember if we'd had sex.

120
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,498
You did, and she's calling it rape.

121
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:18,745
Yeah, by the way, congratulations.
You're the daddy.

122
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,047
The hell I am.

123
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,072
I didn't have sex with anybody.
I certainly didn't rape anyone.

124
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,633
I'm happily married.

125
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,767
Happy enough for the wife
to alibi you?

126
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,242
I was probably here.

127
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,755
I spend more time in the lab
than I do at home.

128
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,013
No alibi.

129
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:35,504
Well, maybe she saw my photo
in Forbes or Fortune.

130
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:37,022
Thought I was an easy target.

131
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,063
All those NBA players out there
and she picked you.

132
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:42,254
Look, I don't mean to brag but,

133
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:43,955
women have been crawling
out of the woodwork

134
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:46,736
ever since my company went public.

135
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:50,855
What's up with the stiffs?

136
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,241
They're my gold mine.

137
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,509
I invented an eco-friendly method
of turning these cadavers into dust

138
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,506
without ever lighting a match.

139
00:06:57,506 --> 00:07:01,218
My flash-freeze method will
revolutionize mortuary science.

140
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:02,864
And that gets you laid
like a rock star.

141
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:05,209
I'd never be unfaithful to my wife.

142
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,777
She stood by me one
failed experiment after another.

143
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:10,205
So you have no problem
taking a paternity test.

144
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,521
If it's necessary.

145
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:14,359
But I'm telling you,
the kid isn't mine.

146
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:19,016
DNA proves it. April Troost's kid
is definitely yours.

147
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,151
But that's impossible.
I didn't touch her.

148
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,479
Immaculate conception's
not gonna hold up in court,

149
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,550
- so why don't you try again?
- All right.

150
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,488
Mr. Pallister admits that
he met the defendant at a bar.

151
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:29,377
They had drinks,

152
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:32,206
but he does not remember
having sexual relations with her.

153
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:34,737
Okay, so you had one too many, you
didn't know what your body was doing.

154
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,806
Intox defense.
That's better.

155
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,404
- I'd know if I raped her.
- You did.

156
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:41,938
And April Troost has
a swollen belly to prove it.

157
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:44,483
In light of the DNA results,

158
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,656
we'll stipulate to paternity.
But the sex was consensual.

159
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,729
There was no rape.

160
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:55,346
Trial Part 15
Tuesday, March 22

161
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:57,772
I begged him to stop.

162
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,948
But he wouldn't listen.

163
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:03,062
This was after he bolted the door.

164
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,568
Yes.

165
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:11,065
He threw me on the floor,
and he pinned me.

166
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:12,383
I couldn't move.

167
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:15,402
- Did you scream?
- At the top of my lungs.

168
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:18,052
But then he covered my mouth
with his hand.

169
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,923
- And I could barely breathe.
- Did you fight him?

170
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:24,808
I think I scratched his face.

171
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,313
But then he got more violent,

172
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:31,989
and he put his hands around my neck
like this, and he choked me.

173
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:36,186
And I thought if I stopped
screaming, then maybe...

174
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,358
maybe he wouldn't kill me.

175
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:42,025
What happened next?

176
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:53,676
He raped me.

177
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,405
He raped me over and over and over.

178
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,074
Do we really want to put that
poor woman through any more pain?

179
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:06,354
What are you offering?

180
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:08,294
Probation, no jail time,

181
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,342
you and I take the rest
of the afternoon off.

182
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,584
I'd rather work.

183
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,169
15 years. He does it all.

184
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:16,522
He's a contributing member of society,
and she belongs in a psych ward.

185
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,222
Your own detectives
tried to commit her.

186
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:20,033
You can't use that.

187
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,410
I can in a custody hearing.

188
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,557
First he denies having sex with her,
now he wants to be father of the year?

189
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:28,002
It's his baby too.
He'll fight her for it.

190
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,693
Unless she agrees to a plea.

191
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,563
Ready?

192
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,882
- I can't face him again.
- You're already halfway there.

193
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:42,824
All you have to do
is keep your eyes on me.

194
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,607
Thank you.

195
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:51,286
Why did you wait eight months
to report the alleged rape?

196
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,220
I was scared.

197
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,346
Confused. Humiliated.

198
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,224
Would you say suicidal?

199
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,253
I wanted to end my life. Yes.

200
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:07,576
And your baby's?

201
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:09,136
No.

202
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:12,447
That's why I couldn't hurt myself.

203
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,909
I love my baby too much.

204
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:19,314
A love so strong, you're willing to charge
the baby's father with rape?

205
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,898
It's the right thing to do.

206
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:23,164
And nothing will change your mind?

207
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,054
No.

208
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:30,085
How about half a million dollars?

209
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:34,381
You called my office this morning
and said you wanted to settle.

210
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:43,241
What the hell were you thinking?

211
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:46,091
That lawyer told me if I lose,
Barclay will take the baby.

212
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,434
He was lying to you.

213
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:50,362
- I didn't know.
- You sandbagged me.

214
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:53,325
Now the jury sees you as
a gold digger, not a rape victim.

215
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:56,414
- I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
- Why didn't you just call me?

216
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,980
Because you'd be mad at me.
You are.

217
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,930
- I can see it in your eyes.
- I'm not mad.

218
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,704
I'm, I'm, I'm disappointed.

219
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,580
How bad is it?

220
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,863
Our only choice is to put you back
on the stand to turn down the settlement.

221
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:10,267
I'll recall you tomorrow,
and you can testify again.

222
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:13,883
I will do anything
to set things right.

223
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:19,376
Trial Part 15
Wednesday, March 23

224
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:22,315
My court starts at 9 sharp, Ms. Novak.

225
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,074
Where's your witness?

226
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,082
I'm sure she's just delayed, your honor.

227
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:27,539
We've been waiting 40 minutes.

228
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:29,386
She's made her decision.
She wants to settle.

229
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:31,827
She had every intention
of testifying today.

230
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:33,819
If I could just have
a brief continuance.

231
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,130
Miss Troost has obviously
changed her mind.

232
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,126
I'm not gonna keep that jury
waiting any longer.

233
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:40,084
Your honor, I have
detective Stabler on the line.

234
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:43,025
Highway police just found miss Troost.

235
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,584
She was traveling eastbound,
missed the curve,

236
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:56,015
- and ran off the cliff right here.
- No guardrail?

237
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,744
I bet they'll find
the money for one after this.

238
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:00,868
The gas tank burst
into flames on impact.

239
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,491
No survivors.

240
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,474
What time?

241
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:12,882
Fire department got the call
around 5 this morning.

242
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:15,197
They said it'd been burning
for quite a while.

243
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:17,956
She probably fell asleep at the wheel.

244
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:20,791
I think you'll find
it's a suicide.

245
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:23,792
Liv, there's nothing
you could've done.

246
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,457
I was angry, and I let it show.

247
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:27,653
You got pissed off
because she lied to you.

248
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:30,101
She needed somebody to believe in her.

249
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,049
The trial can still go on
without April, can't it?

250
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,489
What's the point?

251
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:40,495
I'm offering Barclay a deal.

252
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:43,452
He raped her and
he left her with a child.

253
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:45,259
The jury knows that he did it.

254
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,664
The jury's going to acquit.

255
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:50,428
Last two words they heard
were cash settlement.

256
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:52,727
Which she was about to turn down.

257
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:56,504
Unless she says so on the stand,
it's inadmissible.

258
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:59,968
So we just let Barclay walk?

259
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:02,658
Find me some evidence she was
gonna turn down the settlement,

260
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,881
and I'll use it to bluff
Barclay into a plea.

261
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,717
Apartment of April Troost
104 East 16th Street
Wednesday, March 23

262
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:11,862
There's no suicide note, no diary.

263
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,585
Nothing on her email.
No documents relating to the settlement.

264
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:18,826
Just bills.

265
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,413
Sofa's wet.

266
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,960
What's with the white crust?

267
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,589
Hydrogen peroxide.

268
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,402
Foams up when it comes
into contact with blood cells.

269
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:33,584
Bubbles dry and leaves
this white crust.

270
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:36,483
Well, check out the wall.

271
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,757
See these smears?

272
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:40,818
Tried to wipe off the blood.

273
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,058
And on the floor.

274
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:45,674
No body, but this is
definitely a crime scene.

275
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,952
I'd say we have a homicide.

276
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,603
Perp kills April here,
stuffs her body in the car,

277
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,150
and sends it over the cliff.

278
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,538
I figured out how
the crash was rigged.

279
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:56,882
- Looks like a paint mixing can.
- Similar.

280
00:13:56,882 --> 00:14:00,369
But these are used
to store chemicals in labs.

281
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,734
- Like Barclay Pallister's.
- It was thrown from the car on impact.

282
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,325
See the angle of these dents?

283
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,611
They're consistent with the pail
being wedged under the dash

284
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:09,115
when the pedal's to the metal.

285
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,494
I found more evidence up there.

286
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:14,598
See these tire marks in the pavement?

287
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:16,132
Wheels spun in place.

288
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,115
He wedged in the can,
and revved the engine.

289
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:21,601
Shift the car into drive,
it takes off like a rocket.

290
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:24,073
Kills April in her apartment,
stages the crash here.

291
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:26,631
With her history, Barclay
knew we'd rule it a suicide.

292
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,125
Her body burns up so no one ever
knows what he did to her.

293
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,506
I sent everything from the car's
interior over to the morgue.

294
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:34,382
Maybe Warner can piece together
how she died.

295
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,684
This is all that survived the fire.

296
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:38,140
Not very much.

297
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,112
Fire marshal says
an accelerant was used,

298
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,320
probably gasoline,
to enhance the burn.

299
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,625
Smart guy, he wanted to make sure
we didn't find a body.

300
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,083
I didn't.

301
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:48,500
You mean it was incinerated?

302
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,560
No, I mean, there wasn't
one in that car.

303
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,464
Body burns, you always find something.

304
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:55,755
Partial long bones, dental fillings.

305
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:58,581
Son of a bitch used
his technology to vaporize her.

306
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,556
He had to have access
to her home and her car.

307
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:02,926
Maybe, maybe somebody
saw him with her.

308
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:05,215
April keep her car in a garage?

309
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,341
She parks it on the street.

310
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,071
Poor Ms. Troost.
She's such a sweet lady.

311
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:12,521
- Were you the doorman last night?
- Until 11.

312
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:14,286
- Who relieved you?
- No one.

313
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,754
After I leave, visitors
have to be buzzed in.

314
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:19,372
Well, how about security cameras,
surveillance video?

315
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:21,184
Management's too cheap.

316
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,617
When I retire in August,

317
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:24,733
won't even be a day guy
on the door anymore.

318
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,297
When is the last time
you saw April Troost?

319
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,644
Well, she came home
from a dinner date around 10.

320
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:30,903
You sure it was a date?

321
00:15:30,903 --> 00:15:32,487
She was all dolled up.

322
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:34,875
She went to Luigi's,
which is kinda romantic.

323
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,509
How do you know what restaurant?

324
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,107
She brought me a doggie bag.

325
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:40,929
Nice T-bone for my rottweiler.

326
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,342
Of course I remember her.

327
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,561
She special ordered.

328
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:45,207
No garlic because of the baby.

329
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:47,158
Maybe she was hoping
for a good night kiss.

330
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:49,537
I don't think so.
They barely spoke the whole meal.

331
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,649
- What did he look like?
- Tall.

332
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,396
And from his black American
express card, very rich.

333
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,034
You get a copy of the receipt?

334
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:58,357
Should be behind the bar somewhere.

335
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,854
Uh, how was she acting?

336
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:00,848
Pretty upset.

337
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,054
Before dessert, she yelled
at him and stormed out.

338
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,251
Do you know why?

339
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,661
I figured it was the hormones.

340
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:08,878
Here it is.

341
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,236
Barclay Pallister.

342
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:16,129
Pallister Residence
135 East 84th Street
Thursday, March 24

343
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:19,452
This is sour grapes.
You had to dismiss the rape case,

344
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:21,825
so you're trying to pin
a homicide on an innocent man.

345
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:24,191
The only reason that we lost
the rape case is,

346
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,197
because your client killed
April Troost.

347
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,702
Kind of hard to kill someone
in a crowded restaurant.

348
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:30,349
But easy at her apartment.

349
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,245
I never went to her apartment.

350
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,202
- Where'd you go after Luigi's?
- Straight home.

351
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,571
Will your wife vouch for that?

352
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,753
She left me after you
charged me with rape.

353
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:39,155
Well, if the screw fits.

354
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:42,531
My client met Ms. Troost in a neutral
location with plenty of witnesses.

355
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:44,844
- No law was broken.
- What about witness tampering?

356
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,126
She invited him.

357
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:50,319
So what do a victim and a rapist
talk about over a plate of pasta?

358
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:51,768
Money.

359
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:56,186
She had me by the balls,
so I gave her half a million in cash.

360
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:01,410
You walked through this city
carrying $500,000

361
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,391
and just handed it over to her.

362
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:04,431
Yeah.

363
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:06,121
Then why did she leave crying?

364
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,967
Because she's crazy.

365
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,915
I was happy to pay her just
to get her out of my life.

366
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:14,175
She left with the money,
and I never saw her again.

367
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:15,934
The problem is neither has anyone else.

368
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,367
We're through here.
Charge my client or leave.

369
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,496
By the way, your cleanup job
at the apartment sucked.

370
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:28,381
You should've let April
burn up in that car.

371
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:30,436
You've made an awful
lot of mistakes,

372
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:33,004
and I promise they're gonna
catch up to you.

373
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,285
Every piece of evidence points
to Barclay Pallister.

374
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:41,347
CSU checked his lab.

375
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:45,404
Same chemical cans, same industrial
strength hydrogen peroxide.

376
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:48,405
Which you could find in any lab.
It's still circumstantial.

377
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:50,595
Well, look, the blood
on the sofa, walls, floor,

378
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:52,192
they're a DNA match to April.

379
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:53,517
We don't have a body.

380
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:55,658
Captain, we got a nosy
neighbor off the canvass.

381
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,600
Said she complained to April
about loud music the night she died.

382
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,397
April apologized and said
she'd tell her friend to turn it down.

383
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:02,826
Did the neighbor get
a look at this friend?

384
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:04,924
- She just said him.
- I may know who.

385
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:07,548
April's LUDs, four incoming calls
to her cell phone after dinner,

386
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:10,190
- all from the same number.
- Barclay Pallister.

387
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,304
No. A Roger Mason.
Lives on East 82nd.

388
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,617
April didn't answer the phone.

389
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:18,595
I was worried about the baby,
so I kept calling.

390
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,968
That's what friends do.

391
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,773
Most female homicide victims
are killed by a man they know.

392
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,553
That's another thing friends do.

393
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:25,827
You think I killed her?

394
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:27,873
You got impatient,
because she didn't return your calls.

395
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,578
Went over to her apartment,
got in a fight, and killed her.

396
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:32,610
I'd never hurt my baby.

397
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,855
Your baby?

398
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,019
Our baby.

399
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,663
We were going to adopt
her unborn child.

400
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:41,350
April never mentioned that.

401
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,780
We agreed to pay for the costs and
the fees of the pregnancy and delivery.

402
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,576
How much does a bouncing
baby girl go for these days?

403
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:52,186
$50,000. / Sounds like you
were buying a baby.

404
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:54,372
April didn't want to keep the baby.

405
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,714
This was best for everyone.

406
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,428
Now do you understand?

407
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,106
We could never hurt April.

408
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,074
Then what was so urgent that night?

409
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,538
April was depressed.

410
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:05,375
She'd been through a lot.
Her husband died.

411
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,980
She lost her job,
got behind in the rent.

412
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,046
We had been giving her extra cash.

413
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:13,332
But then two days ago
she stopped returning our calls.

414
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,306
April sure made a bundle
off of that rape.

415
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:17,779
Talk about making a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

416
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:21,619
Half a million from Barclay Pallister,
and 50 grand for selling the baby.

417
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,180
Not exactly the poor, fragile victim
we thought she was.

418
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,158
You have no idea.

419
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:27,856
Meet the Ramseys,

420
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:31,149
the Harts, the Fritzlers.
All expectant parents.

421
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,361
All paid 50 grand
to adopt April Troost's baby.

422
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,532
There could be dozens of marks
we don't even know about.

423
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:38,967
She used the rape and pregnancy
to turn a quick buck.

424
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,320
And everybody she scammed
has motive to kill her.

425
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,033
Excuse me, I'm looking
for captain Cragen.

426
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,013
I'm captain Cragen.

427
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:49,223
Lorraine Dillon.

428
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,818
I'm April Troost's mother.

429
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,485
April said that her mother's
name was Sarah.

430
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:59,680
I've had six husbands
and as many last names.

431
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,527
But I've always been Lorraine.

432
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:05,136
Your daughter also said
that you died of cancer last year.

433
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:08,422
She always had a problem
with the truth.

434
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:11,051
When she was a child,
she'd run away.

435
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:12,604
And when I brought her back home,

436
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:17,469
she'd make all these crazy allegations
against my former husbands.

437
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,208
When's the last time you saw her?

438
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,061
It was about four years ago.

439
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:23,396
We had a fight.

440
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,543
She stole several very expensive
pieces of jewelry,

441
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:30,661
including my grandmother's diamond
and ruby necklace.

442
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:32,276
Did you call the police?

443
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,349
She was my daughter.

444
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:39,489
Maybe if I'd had, she'd,
she would still be alive.

445
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,866
Do you have any idea who did this?

446
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:47,505
Mrs. Dillon, we think April was
mixed up in some illegal activity.

447
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:50,428
- There are quite a few suspects.
- What did she do?

448
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:54,006
She took a lot of money
from a lot of people.

449
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:59,197
April always had a way
of hiding things.

450
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:03,885
I remember once she said something
about a safe deposit box.

451
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:14,006
- Take all the time you need.
- Thank you.

452
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,151
Any jewelry in there?

453
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:20,502
No. Headshots.

454
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:25,017
Those are very handsome men.

455
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,444
And well known.

456
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:29,937
He's a musician.

457
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:33,264
This one owns the hottest
restaurant in New York.

458
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:37,476
This is that new third basemen
that just came up from AAA.

459
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,957
These guys are a lot more
than just good looking.

460
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,909
How about this guy?

461
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,993
Barclay Pallister.

462
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:47,017
The man who raped my daughter?

463
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:58,472
April was stalking Barclay Pallister.

464
00:21:58,472 --> 00:21:59,997
And dozens of other men.

465
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:03,933
All handsome, rich, talented,
at the top of their professions.

466
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:05,140
I know this guy.

467
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,158
J.J. Price.
I've got his CD.

468
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,900
It's quite a gene pool
she's got here.

469
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,442
April was looking for a champion breeder.
Barclay was the winner.

470
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:15,474
Some ho tricked me into fatherhood,
I'd be pretty worked up.

471
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:17,816
And paying child support
for the next 18 years.

472
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:20,482
17.5% of your income before taxes.

473
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:23,534
With April and the baby dead,
Barclay dodges that bullet.

474
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:24,924
Not for the murder charge.

475
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:26,283
If he did it.

476
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:28,584
He's only one of the men
April was stalking.

477
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:31,025
Let's find out who else she burned.

478
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,835
Oh, that crazy chick?

479
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:35,261
- What'd she say I did?
- So you know her?

480
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,796
Yeah, I really wish I didn't.

481
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:40,352
You two have sex?

482
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:42,003
Most likely, yeah.

483
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,227
You forget a hottie like that?
You must get a lot of action.

484
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:46,006
Dude, you don't know
the half of it, man.

485
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,132
I remember her face.
I just don't remember the name.

486
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,328
The whole night was kinda fuzzy.

487
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,526
- Where'd you meet her?
- At my restaurant.

488
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:54,069
Every man with a pulse
checked her out.

489
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:56,032
But she only had eyes for you?

490
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:57,157
And my wallet.

491
00:22:57,157 --> 00:22:59,270
But a body like that
is worth every penny.

492
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,006
- How much she cost you?
- Nothing.

493
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,476
She bought me a beer.

494
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:04,919
- Bet that happens a lot.
- Well, they usually expect me to pay,

495
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,662
especially after signing
my last big contract but,

496
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:08,668
she was different.

497
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:11,797
She knew everything about me,
down to my stats.

498
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:13,136
What'd you do after the drink?

499
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:14,880
Think we went back to my crib.

500
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,008
You think?

501
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,525
That's all you remember?

502
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:21,069
Dude, I remember porcelain, man.
Up close and personal.

503
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,653
How many drinks did she buy you?

504
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,001
Just one, which never
gives me a hangover.

505
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,384
I was sick as a dog.

506
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:27,696
Groggy, nauseous?

507
00:23:27,696 --> 00:23:29,844
Both. I thought I had the flu.

508
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,609
- Did you see a doctor?
- Didn't have to.

509
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:34,203
Pulled a random drug test
the next morning.

510
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:36,167
- I failed.
- What'd you take?

511
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,295
Nothing.

512
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:39,236
She doped me.

513
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:43,137
All right. What'd they find?

514
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:45,129
Rohypnol.

515
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:53,602
What are you doing here?

516
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:54,923
Just need to ask you some questions.

517
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:56,549
- Get the hell away from me.
- Hear me out.

518
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:58,786
The rape charge was dropped.
I don't need to talk to you.

519
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,315
Please, just listen to me.

520
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,788
Now, the first time that you met April,
she bought you a drink.

521
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:03,742
Yeah, so?

522
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,247
What's the next thing you remember?

523
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:08,372
Waking up in my own bed, alone.

524
00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:11,176
Loss of memory. Headache?

525
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:13,494
Nausea.

526
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,172
She put something in my drink?

527
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,425
Rohypnol.

528
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,175
I told you I didn't rape her.

529
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:27,854
I know.

530
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:34,240
But if she slipped me a roofie...

531
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,349
how did I get it up?

532
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,970
The only explanation is a technique
called electro ejaculation.

533
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,897
I don't like the sound of that.

534
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:45,130
Nothing to it.

535
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,273
Insert this end in the rectum,

536
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:51,665
an electric shock causes
an involuntary ejaculation.

537
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,550
Love used to be simpler.

538
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,909
The first procedure
was done back in the '70s

539
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,419
on a teenager who died
in a motorcycle accident.

540
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,252
His parents wanted grandchildren.

541
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:03,429
It's called posthumous reproduction.

542
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:05,520
The sperm from a corpse is viable?

543
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,612
If harvested within 30 hours.

544
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:10,058
Will this thing work
if the guy's not dead?

545
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,888
They've recently started
using this technique

546
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:14,517
on paraplegics and coma victims.

547
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:16,127
If your guys were drugged,

548
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:18,061
they never knew it happened.

549
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:19,671
And this is legal?

550
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,384
No state law provides clear guidance

551
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:24,728
on how to retrieve sperm from
a man who's incapacitated or dead.

552
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:27,034
And you talked to all the men
that April stalked?

553
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,729
34 guys, same story.

554
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:30,731
April buys them a drink.
Next thing they know,

555
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,903
it's morning, she's gone,
they're sick puppies.

556
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:34,861
Any nightmares about cattle prods?

557
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,324
Oh, they never knew what hit them.

558
00:25:36,324 --> 00:25:37,956
I thought I heard of every sex crime.

559
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:40,226
Damn, who thinks this stuff up?

560
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:42,033
Okay, so we know that  April used

561
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,450
Barclay Pallister's
sperm to impregnate herself.

562
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,623
What did she do with the rest?

563
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:47,097
A lot of women out there
would pay big money

564
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:49,220
to have one of these guys
father their children.

565
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,057
Sperm banks make big bucks
off genius sperm.

566
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:54,146
We have seven sperm banks
in New York city.

567
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:56,312
Let's split them up
and hit them all.

568
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:59,475
McManus Institute
114 East 57th Street
Friday, March 25

569
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,477
Welcome to the institute.

570
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,039
Please have a seat
and fill this out.

571
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,662
We're not interested in your services.

572
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:06,541
Do you know this woman?

573
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,865
April. She used to work here.

574
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:10,488
What was her job?

575
00:26:10,488 --> 00:26:12,286
Collections.

576
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:14,357
She was our accountant.

577
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:16,030
You lying son of a bitch.

578
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,812
You're a fraud.

579
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,351
Listen to that crap.

580
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:22,546
Excuse me?

581
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,010
- Who are you?
- The police.

582
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,539
- What's going on in here?
- That quack tricked me.

583
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:27,953
I did nothing of the sort.

584
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,651
- I want my money back.
- Okay, stop.

585
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:31,829
Now, what exactly is the problem?

586
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:33,535
He said my baby
would be playing Mozart.

587
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:35,194
I told you there were no guarantees.

588
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,304
She can't even play chopsticks!
All she does is bang on the damn keys!

589
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:40,223
All right, what exactly
did you promise her? / Nothing.

590
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,029
I inseminated her with the life juice
of a renowned musician.

591
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:45,024
A genius in his field
who will remain nameless.

592
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:46,138
Then why am I stuck with her?

593
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,640
You provided 50%
of her genetic material.

594
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,375
Perhaps she inherited your traits.

595
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,011
Okay, how much did you pay
for this super sperm?

596
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:58,748
$20,000. / I want this woman arrested
for trespassing.

597
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:00,268
What are you doing?

598
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:01,424
I'm arresting you.

599
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:03,222
For, for what?

600
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,133
Stealing sperm.

601
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,822
What?

602
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:12,004
This is absurd.

603
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:14,397
You obviously don't understand
the magnitude of my work.

604
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,231
I'm saving the human race.

605
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,761
By stealing sperm.

606
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,026
I didn't steal anything.

607
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:23,316
You conspired with April Troost
to forcibly obtain the mother lodes.

608
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:24,629
Nobody was forced.

609
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:26,553
She explained my mission
to the gentlemen,

610
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,217
and persuaded them to donate.

611
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:29,735
Yeah, with a cattle prod.

612
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,318
I had no idea.

613
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,832
I'm sorry if people were hurt.

614
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:35,087
But their suffering will benefit
the greater good.

615
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,150
And how's that?

616
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,487
The intelligence of the world's
population is rapidly declining.

617
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:41,436
Poor, less educated people

618
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:44,702
are reproducing at higher rates
than bright, successful ones.

619
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:46,927
I have four kids.

620
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:48,719
Yes.

621
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:51,625
My work will reverse mankind's
inevitable demise

622
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:57,044
by spreading the seeds of world class
scientists, musicians, athletes.

623
00:27:57,044 --> 00:28:01,637
You're nothing but a Nazi trying
to engineer a master race.

624
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,008
He's a nut job.

625
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:09,045
A lot of researchers think
he's Nobel prize material.

626
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:10,768
Who, the Dr. Mengele fan club?

627
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,535
Almost everyone in genetic engineering.

628
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,952
His work in pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis

629
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:18,490
allows us to screen embryos
for severe disorders

630
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,635
like Tay-sachs, cystic fibrosis,
down syndrome.

631
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:23,068
He's legit.

632
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,877
And controversial.

633
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:28,556
He just invented a technique for couples
to select their own baby's sex.

634
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:32,116
And he's researching ways of manipulating
inherited characteristics

635
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:36,013
- like height, eye color, intelligence...
- Making designer babies.

636
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,294
He can't do it yet.
But in our lifetime,

637
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:40,652
wealthy couples are gonna be
able to custom-order a baby.

638
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,854
- And the couples who can't afford it?
- There'll be two races.

639
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,612
The enhanced and the average,

640
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:46,849
driving a bigger wedge
between the rich and the poor.

641
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:49,241
Looks like McManus' research is on ice.

642
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,207
What happened?

643
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:51,583
His clinic's broke.

644
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:54,259
He makes hundreds of thousands
selling genius sperm.

645
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:55,715
But his research is expensive.

646
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:57,428
It's a temporary setback.

647
00:28:57,428 --> 00:29:00,607
Dr. Frankenstein had a backup plan.

648
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,471
What's that?

649
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:11,861
April's life insurance policy
naming you as the sole beneficiary.

650
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:14,115
$5 million?

651
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:17,279
You just went from zero to rich
faster than it takes to drive off a cliff.

652
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,556
How could I know April was gonna
have a tragic accident?

653
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:22,052
Well, she didn't.
You murdered her.

654
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,616
That's preposterous.

655
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:25,218
It's more like ingenious.

656
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:26,765
You recognize that?

657
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,441
It's a chemical storage can.

658
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,291
We found it at the scene
at April's car crash.

659
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,854
It's just like the one
you use at your lab.

660
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,681
Know what else we found at your lab?

661
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,807
Hydrogen peroxide.

662
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,013
Same concentrate that was used to clean
up April's blood in her apartment.

663
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,850
Hundreds of labs use these things.

664
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,697
But I bet yours was the only one
who took out an insurance policy

665
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:46,484
on the one person who could blow
the whistle on where you got your sperm.

666
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,847
She suckered you, too, didn't she?

667
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:49,743
She blackmailed you
so nobody would find out?

668
00:29:49,743 --> 00:29:51,029
That's why you were so broke.

669
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:54,191
And if your clinic closes down,
you're not saving the world.

670
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,838
So you murdered her
for the insurance money.

671
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,669
No. I loved her.

672
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,317
Oh, so you were sleeping with her too.

673
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:02,144
That's disgusting.

674
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:04,181
She's my daughter.

675
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:06,410
I didn't kill her.

676
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,044
And I can prove it.

677
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,601
Who told you?

678
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:15,774
Your father.

679
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,869
Mother always said never trust a man.

680
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:21,250
Where's the baby, April?

681
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,720
It was stillborn.

682
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,018
You're a liar.

683
00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:26,713
What, you didn't need it anymore,
so you killed it?

684
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:29,103
That's not a very nice thing
to say to someone in mourning.

685
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:32,460
Cut the act, April!
I'm sick of your crap.

686
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,095
You were my friend.
You promised to protect me.

687
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:39,093
When you were a rape victim,
not a rapist.

688
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:41,111
You sexually assaulted three dozen men.

689
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:42,721
Really?

690
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:46,723
- Did they tell you I assaulted them?
- We've got you on extortion and fraud.

691
00:30:46,723 --> 00:30:49,486
Not to mention ripping off
childless couples.

692
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:52,001
And extorting half a million dollars
from Barclay Pallister.

693
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,428
It was a settlement.

694
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:56,478
There's nothing illegal about being paid
for my pain and suffering.

695
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:59,504
Faking your own murder
for the insurance money is.

696
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,991
Gotta hand it to you.
Smearing your own blood on the walls?

697
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:04,546
- That was good.
- You have a sick imagination.

698
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:06,849
On my best day, I couldn't
make this stuff up.

699
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:09,105
I'm the victim here.
None of this is my fault.

700
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,472
April Troost, you are
under arrest for fraud.

701
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:15,043
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can...

702
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,644
You're only charging April
with fraud and extortion?

703
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,267
She's a walking crime spree.

704
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:22,707
My hands are tied.

705
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:25,429
Three dozen of her victims don't
even have a memory of being raped.

706
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:27,351
What about the baby?

707
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:30,653
No hospitals in the tri-state area
even have a record that she delivered one.

708
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,415
Casey, trust me, she did.

709
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:35,265
And then she sold it
or she drowned it or who knows.

710
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:38,716
But that evil bitch did
something terrible with that baby.

711
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:40,887
You know, for all we know,
it really was stillborn,

712
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:43,637
- and that's not a crime.
- No, it's a con!

713
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:45,812
April has been scamming us
since day one.

714
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,307
She never had any intention
of jumping off that ledge.

715
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,661
She played you, so now you're pissed.

716
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:51,066
Yes, I'm pissed.

717
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,644
But we still have to find that baby.

718
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,667
Not to mention ruining
Barclay Pallister's life.

719
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,851
That's not our fault.
That's April's.

720
00:31:57,851 --> 00:32:01,343
And knowing her, she will find
someone else to blame.

721
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:02,574
Her mother.

722
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:05,917
April was raised without
any moral values whatsoever.

723
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,543
So she's a sociopath.

724
00:32:07,543 --> 00:32:09,761
April's well aware
of right and wrong,

725
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,166
but she believes
the law doesn't apply to her.

726
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,673
That's how she was brought up.

727
00:32:13,673 --> 00:32:15,559
My mother told me that
storks bring babies and

728
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,532
that Santa came down the chimney.

729
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:19,666
But you know what,
you grow up and you realize

730
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,677
that some of the things your
parents told you aren't true.

731
00:32:21,677 --> 00:32:23,248
Not if you're brainwashed.

732
00:32:23,248 --> 00:32:27,177
April Troost is like a suicide bomber,
indoctrinated from birth.

733
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:30,649
She lives her life
by the lies her mother told her.

734
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,497
Ignorance of the law is no defense.

735
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,483
Mental defect is.

736
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:39,352
Your shrink will agree,
April wasn't responsible for her actions.

737
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:44,227
Mother had me running scams
from the day I was born.

738
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:47,190
I saved her thousands in hospital bills.

739
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,689
She conned her doctor?

740
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,348
She took him for everything he had.

741
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:55,642
He was husband number two.

742
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,458
Do you find tricking people amusing?

743
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,255
Absolutely.

744
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:03,180
Mother always said

745
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,642
if you're too stupid to see the wool
being pulled over your eyes,

746
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,306
you deserve what you get.

747
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:11,547
So it's okay to rip people off,
to break the law?

748
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:15,416
I know there are rules.

749
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,713
But they don't apply to me.

750
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:21,304
- How did that go over in school?
- I didn't go to school.

751
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:24,394
Mother didn't want me picking up
any bad habits.

752
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:27,389
- Like what?
- Feeling sorry for people.

753
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:29,907
What mother called "getting soft."

754
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,076
She taught me to stay alert.

755
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,500
- Be on the lookout.
- For what?

756
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,706
There are always people who want
to take advantage of me.

757
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:41,012
That's why I have to take
advantage of them first.

758
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,611
Survival of the fittest.

759
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:44,272
Screw or get screwed.

760
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,092
Mother drilled that into me.

761
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:48,960
She taught me everything
she knew about people.

762
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,640
Men in particular.

763
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,540
She went through six husbands
and their fortunes.

764
00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:00,393
What about your father, Dr. McManus?

765
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:02,416
Husband number one.

766
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,459
She left him right after I was born.

767
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,371
He was brilliant but broke.

768
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:10,051
I didn't meet him until a year ago.

769
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:14,788
He was thrilled to find
the daughter he never knew.

770
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:16,448
And how did you feel?

771
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,584
It was the opportunity of a lifetime.

772
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:20,535
I needed a job,

773
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:24,889
and he paid me well to bring him
the best genetic material.

774
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,908
Barclay Pallister.

775
00:34:28,403 --> 00:34:32,968
April, don't you think that he
deserves to know where his baby is?

776
00:34:32,968 --> 00:34:36,279
Only if I get a sweet deal.

777
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,325
Why should you get a break?

778
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:43,247
I'm too beautiful for prison.

779
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,834
I had no idea
how sick she really is.

780
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,554
April fooled everybody.

781
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:48,647
She's quite an actress.

782
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:51,159
I bailed her out,
and this is the thanks I get.

783
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,102
All of her problems are my fault.

784
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:57,130
Can she do this?
Can she tell all these lies in court?

785
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,860
I can make sure
the jury hears the truth.

786
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,437
- You can testify.
- No.

787
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:03,960
Let her say what
she wants about me.

788
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,418
I'm on my way
back to Florida tonight.

789
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:11,096
Hi, mom.

790
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:13,176
How could you do this
to your own mother?

791
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:16,700
Oh, some mother. You led the cops right
to my safe deposit box.

792
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,059
Too bad the money wasn't there.

793
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:20,231
This is not about the money.

794
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:22,890
Just tell them where the baby is.

795
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,168
Are you kidding?

796
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,085
I'm through with you.

797
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,691
No way I'm letting April walk.

798
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:33,360
Well, if we don't give her
some kind of plea,

799
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,811
we may never find the baby.

800
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,206
How do we know it's alive?

801
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:37,604
I'm sure of it.

802
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:39,160
It's her only bargaining chip.

803
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,353
We checked out all the couples
who had contracts to buy April's baby.

804
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:43,560
None of them have the child.

805
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,857
Hotel clerk says
she checked in alone.

806
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:47,965
She was not pregnant.
There are no leads off her LUDs.

807
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,050
That baby could be anywhere.

808
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,859
Black market in newborns?
That's booming.

809
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,379
She's a cold-hearted bitch.

810
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:53,626
But is she crazy?

811
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:54,499
No.

812
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:55,790
She's amoral.

813
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,034
She knows what she's doing is wrong.

814
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:58,793
The jury will see it
as just another con job.

815
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:00,964
Take her to trial,
you're never gonna find the kid.

816
00:36:00,964 --> 00:36:03,099
Wherever the baby is, it's
better off than being with April.

817
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,694
Unless she sold the kid
to a pedophile.

818
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,367
You have to find my baby.

819
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,617
Mr. Pallister.

820
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:11,101
You must make April
tell you where the baby is.

821
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:14,845
She won't. Unless we let her off,
and I can't do that.

822
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,113
You have to.

823
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,906
She's a dangerous woman.

824
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:22,473
You owe me.

825
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:27,424
Do we have any other leverage on her?

826
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:30,889
Rikers Island
Tuesday, March 29

827
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,369
You're wrong about April.

828
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:34,004
She's a sweet girl.

829
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:36,790
If anyone's to blame,
it's her mother.

830
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:39,929
I never should've chosen Lorraine.

831
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,676
For what?

832
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:44,472
My first experiment.

833
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:46,365
I was looking for the perfect woman.

834
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:49,935
Bright, beautiful, accomplished.
Lorraine was ideal.

835
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:52,732
I married her,
and we had April.

836
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:54,702
She was a beautiful baby.

837
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:56,347
Smart.

838
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,811
170 IQ.

839
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:00,252
Great, but what happened
to your experiment?

840
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,583
I thought I'd picked the ultimate mate,

841
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:06,198
but Lorraine wanted to be rich.

842
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:07,731
I wasn't.

843
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:14,160
I didn't see April
till she found me last year.

844
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,167
I was just so happy
to have my daughter back.

845
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,602
Your daughter's using you to scam
rich and powerful men.

846
00:37:20,602 --> 00:37:23,068
She meant no harm.
She was just trying to help me.

847
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:26,118
By claiming Barclay Pallister raped her
and then having his child to prove it?

848
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,590
She knew it was wrong.

849
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,090
And she came to me.

850
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,220
And she said that she had to die
to fix this mess she made.

851
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,878
Right, and you'd collect
on her insurance.

852
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,946
No, no, I was, I was
gonna give April all the money

853
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:39,949
so she and the baby
could start a new life.

854
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:43,448
Except that new life
doesn't include the baby.

855
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:45,950
- What do you mean?
- April doesn't have the child.

856
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,118
And she won't tell us where it is.

857
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:49,964
She'll tell me.

858
00:37:50,612 --> 00:37:52,279
April, you're confused.

859
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,683
You're not thinking about
what's best for the baby.

860
00:37:54,683 --> 00:37:57,768
I'm not confused. I'm thinking about
what's best for me.

861
00:37:57,768 --> 00:37:59,605
- No one else will.
- I will.

862
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:00,715
Yeah, right.

863
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:03,070
They offer you a deal
if you got me to give up the kid?

864
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,259
No, I'm just trying to help you.

865
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:09,466
Why?

866
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,550
I'm your father.
I love you, April.

867
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,299
Love is for suckers.
That baby's my ticket out of here.

868
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:17,397
I want my deal.

869
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,451
I can't give you one.

870
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,645
Well, then I can't give you my baby.

871
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,270
Please.

872
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,201
Take this baby away from her
before she destroys it.

873
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:44,192
Fine, you have your deal.
No jail.

874
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:46,667
Now, where's the baby?

875
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,651
Nice doing business with you.

876
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,740
- Novak let you off, didn't she?
- Yeah.

877
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,407
I'm glad.

878
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,532
Why?

879
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:14,815
Because you don't deserve
to be a mother.

880
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:16,239
And I'm gonna make sure

881
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:19,513
that you never see that child again.

882
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:21,742
Good.

883
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:24,450
Maybe the kid'll have a chance.

884
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:30,838
You poor thing.

885
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,979
They stole your purse at the funeral?

886
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,452
Yes.

887
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:37,808
My credit cards, my ID, my cash.

888
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:42,123
My daughter is dead, and I just want to
get my grandbaby back to Florida.

889
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:45,456
Well, here's a voucher
for a train ticket to Miami.

890
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:48,068
- Thank you.
- You're not going anywhere.

891
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:50,465
Detectives.

892
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:53,068
Oh, man, you are a piece of work.

893
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,255
Just curious.

894
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,089
How did you track me down?

895
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,350
Your daughter gave you up.

896
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,056
You two have been
working together all along.

897
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:07,180
That was quite a performance
you gave at our squadroom.

898
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,956
Well, that's my girl.

899
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:10,516
I taught her everything she knows.

900
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:13,692
Well, you won't be teaching
that child a damn thing.

901
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:17,457
I can't prove that you broke
the law this time but, lady...

902
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,871
I am gonna get you.

903
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:36,877
Olivia.

904
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:38,249
How's the baby?

905
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:40,110
Sarah's fine.

906
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,669
Not that April
or her mother give a damn.

907
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:45,627
I bet you they're in a bar
right now laughing at us.

908
00:40:45,627 --> 00:40:48,151
- Let it go.
- I can't.

909
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:51,045
They scammed everyone,
and we just let them walk.

910
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:53,421
- We got the baby.
- I know.

911
00:40:53,594 --> 00:40:55,899
But we haven't seen the last of them.

912
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:58,930
They will never stop
playing their sick games.

913
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,673
Okay, she's medically cleared.

914
00:41:00,673 --> 00:41:02,551
You can take her.

915
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:03,980
Hi.

916
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:07,945
Liv, you gotta stop
beating yourself up.

917
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:11,839
The baby matters more.
Now she'll bloved.

918
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,518
I was up all night preparing her room.

919
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,782
Because Sarah deserves the best.

920
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:22,598
Well, she's certainly got it.

921
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:25,834
- You take care.
- Thank you.

922
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,989
I hear April's IQ is 170.

923
00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:33,024
That's what Dr. McManus says, yeah.

924
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,476
Yes, I've read up on him.
He's brilliant.

925
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:38,660
And she has good genes
on my side, too.

926
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,218
She's perfect.
