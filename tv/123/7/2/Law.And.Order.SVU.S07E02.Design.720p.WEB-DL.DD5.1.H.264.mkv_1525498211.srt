20
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:34,872
- 自己修改了審判規則  - 夠了 McCoy先生

24
00:36:35,888 --> 00:36:37,788
直到警察給你看她的照片你才確認是她

25
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:55,131
執行逮捕

芝加哥的Marilyn Stocker

只要有人在晚上8點后進大樓
Anybody comes in the building after 8:00 p.M.,

30
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:36,099
只是你得給我個好理由為什么我應該接受你的條件
If you can give me a good reason why I should accept a plea.

31
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,459
只不過她正好因為殺人而被捕
Except she happened to be caught for the murder?

32
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,718
之前有幾晚她都沒回來
There were a couple of nights when she didn't come back.

Really? That's odd. He's always in by now.

41
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,388
這種無名死尸案破案率好像才六分之一吧
To be buried by convicts, six to a grave?

42
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,756
這只是禁止使用對Dunbar先生不利的證據
That only disallows use of the evidence against Mr. Dunbar.

43
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:28,597
這一事實應該被陪審團聆聽并記錄下
The matter deserves a hearing on the record.

44
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,215
這一令狀原則下的證據可以采納
to the warrant requirement.

45
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:34,938
這樣就不會讓人懷疑了
Nice way to lower the odds.

46
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:24,248
這些證據之前并沒有呈現給各位
which has not been presented to you.

47
00:39:34,946 --> 00:39:37,677
這些證據證詞應該公平的得到呈現

48
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,926

We took that at South Street Seaport. That's me with Joanne.

53
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:36,983
這是我們多年來度過的最美好的時光了

54
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,593
這是我的簽名 而這是乘務員簽的
That's my signature and that's the clerk's.

55
00:41:20,459 --> 00:41:21,585
這是為他著想

56
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:23,517
這是她嗎 她是Joanne
Is that her? That's Joanne.

57
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,201
這是她的丈夫 Billy Dunbar
That's her husband, Billy Dunbar.

58
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,597
這是他的辦公室
That's his office.

59
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:02,320
這是將槍支以及
Motion to suppress the gun

60
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,649
這是Johnson先生
That's Mr. Johnson.

61
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:24,798
這就能說明為什么她這么小心了
That would explain her discretion.

62
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,634
這和你一直以來
It had nothing to do with the fact that all this time

63
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:36,298
這和本案有關 你最好別再談我的性生活
Is relevant to this case, if you'd stop focusing on my sex life.

64
00:30:19,786 --> 00:30:21,515
這根本就不是謀殺案的不在場證明
It's not an alibi for the murder.

65
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,566
這個爭議點已經裁決了 是您自己的裁決
This issue was decided! It was your own ruling.

66
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,873
這棟樓里有多少間辦公室
How many offices are there in this building?

67
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,880
這次會面是不合適 片面的
This entire meeting is an improper ex parte approach.

68
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:04,923
這次不要再搞錯名字了
Get the names right this time.

69
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:06,964
這不是好征兆 對吧
That's not a good sign, is it?

70
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:09,628
這不是悲傷的姐姐Lucy Sullivan嗎

怎么了 你腿扭到了
What's the matter? Your leg acting up?

74
00:34:52,368 --> 00:34:53,903

有沒有打給男朋友的

有好幾項判決已經表明 在不滿足"清晰可觸摸"

有 可上面沒照片
Yeah. But without pictures.

111
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,859
用另一套關于本案的說法取而代之
with an alternate theory of the crime.

112
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,231
印第安納 不 是威斯康辛
Indiana. No, Wisconsin.

113
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,180
因為她沒有訴訟資格
Because she had no standing!

114
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,786
因為她打電話到那里去問路

115
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,631
因為他最關心的是正義
He cared mostly about justice.

116
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:56,813
因為訴訟是被一個專業而且自信
Misinformed by a professional confidence woman

117
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:33,088
因為是猶太節日的緣故 簿記員沒有認出這張照片里的人
Jewish holiday. Bookkeeper didn't recognize the picture.

118
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,259
因為被告隱瞞了事實
because the defendant withheld them.

119
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:15,159
因此在本次審判中是不應得到承認的

120
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,015
因此 我們決定發回重審

121
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,090
意思是你不知道她會來嗎
So you weren't expecting her?

122
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:48,815
以防他現身
in case he shows up.

123
00:32:31,393 --> 00:32:33,588
以此來躲避追捕她的人
and escape the people who were pursuing her.

124
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:34,431
已經無法繼續主持該案審理了

125
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,892
依然可以作為對Sullivan小姐的不利證據
We can still use it against Miss Sullivan.

126
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:24,076

The prohibition against double jeopardy is paramount and...

127
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:13,969
一罪不能二審的規則并不是絕對的
The prohibition against double jeopardy is not absolute.

128
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,320
一支點25口徑魯格手槍
A.25 caliber Ruger pistol.

129
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:02,487

一級謀殺 Jack

131
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:00,552
一次上樓 一次下樓
One up and one down.

132
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,057
也許在這里
Maybe here?

133
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:09,121
也許你是出于自衛
Maybe it was self-defense.

134
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:17,163
也許還能促進本案盡快結案
It might even speed things up.

135
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,405
也許當他被殺時她還在牢里
She might have been in jail when he was killed.

136
00:22:58,981 --> 00:22:59,970
也許
Maybe?

137
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,394
也許... 也許她還襲擊了你
Maybe... Maybe she was attacking you.

138
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:11,965
也是Lucy Sullivan的舊同事
and a former co-worker of Lucy Sullivan.

139
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:22,277
也是 抱歉我沒心情和你們慶祝
Yeah. Pardon me if I don't celebrate.

140
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,338
也跑到那里去了 是吧
and went over there, too, right?

141
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:06,151
也就是說她的動機
Meaning her motive,

142
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:07,222
也會記得芝加哥這個地方的
would have remembered Chicago.

143
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:01,905
要問你床上最喜歡的姿勢是什么呢
to ask your favorite sexual positions next.

144
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:09,446
要求在他提到那些東西前將之排除出陪審團所聽內容之外
out of the hearing of the jury, before he mentions it.

145
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,152
要么是Bryant法官 要么就第三次開審本案
Judge Bryant, or we start all over again with trial number three.

146
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:06,278
要講發現那件所謂兇器的事 對嗎
the discovery of the alleged murder weapon?

147
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:39,982
要不然她是在這里過夜了
or else she spent the night?

148
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:32,178
要不然他怎么會伸手摸那里
Why else did he reach for it?

149
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:19,384
延續到晚上直到早上6點
All night till 6:00 in the morning.

150
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:08,935
新澤西 當我去梅多蘭茲體育場時
New Jersey? When I go to the Meadowlands,

151
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:56,367
謝謝
Thank you.

152
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,995
謝了 那如果兇手在8點之前進來
Thanks, and if the shooter came in before 8:00,

153
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:48,174
效力確實會更強 這是否就是你試圖
It would be stronger. Is that why you're trying to

154
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,598
小姐 能請你出來一會兒嗎
Miss, would you step out here for a minute, please?

155
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,693
像她這樣的年輕姑娘 肯定有人會盯上她的
Young woman like that, somebody's gonna come looking for her.

156
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,135
想知道要走多久
wanted to know how much time to allow.

157
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,497
相信我 他會寧愿我穿人造纖維的衣服
Trust me. He would have been just as big a fan of rayon.

158
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,808
相當確定
Pretty sure.

159
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:15,516
現在又是誰在下結論了 Gillum先生
Now who's calling for a conclusion, Mr. Gillum?

160
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:11,537
現在我要各位辛苦點 出于法律上的原因
Now, I am going to impose on you a little. For reasons of law,

161
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:00,223
現在他的發型更像喬治克魯尼了
It's a little bit more George Clooney.

162
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,838
現在是昨天的凌晨1點
It's 1:00am. Yesterday.

163
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:09,881
現在就問 否則我視作公訴方的詢問結束
Now, or I'll deem the People's examination concluded.

164
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:45,167
現在反而更充分
is even stronger now,

165
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:25,456
現在的電梯可牛了
Now the elevators are smart.

166
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,739
下次你看到我 看清楚我肩頭托著個什么
Next time you see me, look at what's on my shoulders.

167
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,866
無話可說啊
Can't argue with that.

168
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:22,243
我坐在這里整整一個月
on the bench for the last month

169
00:42:57,764 --> 00:42:59,095
我總是很公正的
Always fairly.

170
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,590
我總共就見過他幾次
I only seen him a couple of times total.

171
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:55,154
我知道他們肯定殺了他
I knew they'd killed him.

172
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:11,672
我知道你現在還是很悲傷
I know this is still a difficult time,

173
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:51,456
我知道你對法官很藐視
I understand you were in contempt.

174
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:51,914
我只是想讓陪審團獲知真相
I want to put the truth before the jury.

175
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,858
我只請求再等多幾分鐘 法官大人
If I could just have a few more minutes, Your Honor.

176
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,028
我只見過有個女人在這里一次
I only seen a woman once.

177
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,825
我真想嘗下軟殼螃蟹的味道
I really want to try the soft-shell crab.

178
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:20,384
我這是讓你的部下冷靜冷靜
I'm letting your boy cool his heels for a while.

179
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,238
我怎么知道
How would I know?

180
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,216
我在收拾房間的時候見過她一兩次
one or two times when I was making the bed.

181
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:40,974
我在排氣口找到個東西 點25口徑的子彈
I got something. In the vent. .25 caliber bullet.

182
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,760
我又沒去過那里 噢 等一下 等下
Well, I didn't go there. Oh, wait a minute. Wait!

183
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,970
我又按了按扭 又有一部電梯來了
I pushed the button again, and another one came.

184
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,258
我有些錢 不要傷害我
I have some money. You don't have to hurt me.

185
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:50,448
我有天幫他捎了個口信 給你們幫上忙沒
I took a message for him the other day. Does that help?

186
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,719
我有個更好的辦法 不如去那間公寓看看吧
I've got a better idea. Let's go to the apartment.

187
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:45,867
我有辦法利用這點來幫她們逃稅
I've got a plane to catch.

188
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:17,902
我因為要出游所以離開 沒你們想的那么復雜
I'm leaving on vacation. It's not that complicated.

189
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,322
我以為他想順道載我們
I thought that he was trying to pick us up.

190
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:00,121
我以為他接著
I thought he was going

191
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,796
我一直想就此謝謝您
I've been meaning to thank you.

192
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:41,749
我一直都想去紐約旅游
I'd always wanted to come to New York on a vacation.

193
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:47,182
我也不想打攪你的美餐
Well, I hate to bother you,

194
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:29,879
我要找律師
I want a lawyer.

195
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,699
我要先去見Marks法官 幫你保釋
I'm going to see Judge Marks first, about bail.

196
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,758
我要提出撤回訴訟的動議
I move for dismissal.

197
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,750
我要求休庭
I move for an adjournment

198
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:00,095
我研究了一下 看來有必要檢查下
I did some research. It looked to check out.

199
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:27,779
我宣布審判無效
I'm declaring a mistrial.

200
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:06,442
我需要花些時間來準備 法官大人
I'm going to need a moment to prepare, Your Honor.

201
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:35,709
我想在孩子們去上學前把欄桿修好
I wanted to fix the railing before the kids left for school.

202
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:13,258
我想我們能說服Marks法官...
I think we'll convince Judge Marks...

203
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,638
我想問 你到底在干什么
What were you doing, may I ask?

204
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:43,550
我想你可能想知道這事
I thought you'd want to know.

205
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,715
我想即便是這個接待員
I think even that receptionist

206
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,387
我相信上次當我判決把你前夫代理的一個騙子
I believe we last had the pleasure when I was sentencing

207
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,906
我現在成了被告方證人了嗎 法官大人
Am I a defense witness, Judge?

208
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:34,853
我五點半就下班了
I'm done at 5:30 though.

209
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:20,515
我提前下班了
I left early.

210
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,490
我說不行就是不行
Not if I say you can't.

211
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:13,757
我是說 這也太糟糕了 我很抱歉
I mean, this is awful. I'm sorry.

212
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:07,097
我是說 他已經欠了1個月的租金 所以...
I mean, he owes a month's rent, so...

213
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,460
我是說 他們沒必要這么早開會
I mean, they don't have to come in early.

214
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:26,381
我是個會計
I'm an accountant.

215
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:59,755
我是多么地愛他
I loved him so much.

216
00:29:25,594 --> 00:29:27,994
我甚至不知道Joanne認識他
I didn't even know that Joanne knew him.

217
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:35,827
我任命Bryant法官接替你
I'm assigning Judge Bryant.

218
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:00,995
我判斷她年齡大概25歲或者更大些
I make her 25, maybe a little older.

219
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:32,544
我明天就拿來這些資料
I can have them by tomorrow.

220
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,879
我們作出了怎樣的改進
what kind of improvements we've made.

221
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:19,829
我們正在調查Lucy Sullivan的謀殺案
We're investigating the murder of Lucy Sullivan.

222
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,100
我們在這里難道不是做他們要求我們做的事嗎
Is that what we're being asked to do?

223
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,543
我們在高中跟若別人約會 我們只會帶
and we were dating in high school, we would only bring home

224
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,932
我們有個老笑話 當我們父母還活著時
That was our old joke. When my parents were alive

225
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,163
我們有"其他"的東西
Or something.

226
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:40,041
我們已經聽了一位來自新澤西州的警官的證詞
We've heard testimony from a New Jersey police officer

227
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,092
我們想省錢
We were saving the surcharge.

228
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,822
我們為啥非要早上6點來這里
Why do we have to come in at 6:00 a.M.

229
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,843
我們通過電話找到了兩人
We reached them both by phone.

230
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:10,522
我們手頭有物證
We have the facts.

231
00:36:49,737 --> 00:36:52,228
我們確認了新澤西方面的逮捕令是合法的
We ascertained that the New Jersey warrant was valid

232
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:58,892
我們敲過門了 沒人應門
We knocked on the door. Nobody answered.

233
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:54,106
我們可以說明被告的動機 從而和兇器聯系起來
We can show motive, access to the murder weapon.

234
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:46,300
我們看了你和McCoy先生的陳述材料
We've read your brief, sir, and Mr. McCoy's,

235
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,717
我們就要拿尺子 圓規在那里量來量去
and we'll all sit around with rulers, protractors.

236
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,307
我們就為了沒有的事起床
I just got out of bed for nothing.

237
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:26,766
我們進入公寓搜尋他
We entered the apartment and looked for him.

238
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,555
我們覺得你對你妹妹的丈夫很熟悉呢
We think you knew your sister's husband real well.

239
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:56,635
我們覺得公訴方的理由很有說服力
We find the People's argument persuasive.

240
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:47,466
我們很好奇
We're just wondering,

241
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,912
我們發現了一具沒有身份證明的女尸
A woman was found with no identification on her.

242
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,546
我們都拿到他的客戶名單了
I say we get his client list.

243
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,698
我們都忽視了本案的事實
We were all ignorant of the facts,

244
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:17,134
我們的優勢被扯平了
Luck of the draw.

245
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,061
我們得要拿幾樣東西
We're gonna have to take numbers.

246
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:04,438
我們得從她身份開始查起
We gotta get started on the ID.

247
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:44,511
我們查了昨晚的登記表 只有兩個女人進來過
We ran down the names on the night sign-in. Only two women.

248
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:32,683
我們查到你妹妹住你酒店房間
We traced your sister to your hotel

249
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:52,213
我們不知道 他畢竟是她丈夫
We don't know. He was her husband.

250
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:56,714
我們本來是要聽結案陳詞的
We're supposed to hear closings.

251
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:42,148
我妹妹 Joanne 昨天晚上沒有回房來
My sister, Joanne, she didn't come back to the room last night.

252
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,827
我每天看到幾千張臉
I see a thousand faces a day.

253
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:47,860
我沒有其他問題了
I have no further questions.

254
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:15,263
我沒有盯著衣柜
I wasn't looking at the closet.

255
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,033
我沒事 不過如果你去的話 記得穿絲綢衣服
I'm okay. But if you go, wear silk.

256
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:28,914
我沒弄清楚的是
What I don't see there

257
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:29,318
我忙著關于本案的事情
On a matter of business for this court.

258
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,566
我懇請
I respectfully suggest that

259
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,111
我可沒指控你什么
I'm not pressing any charge.

260
00:41:29,435 --> 00:41:31,131
我看了副本的全部內容
I read the whole transcript.

261
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:28,068
我看不到槍
I don't see the gun.

262
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:46,409
我開槍射某人之前也總是很緊張
Hey, I always get butterflies just before I shoot somebody.

263
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,403
我就知道有些不對勁
I knew something was wrong.

264
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,102
我就是Lucy Sullivan
I'm Lucy Sullivan.

00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,929
他曾經娶了你妹妹
He was married to your sister.

398

所有人都去
All of us?

401
00:25:35,782 --> 00:25:38,615
所以要不然Sullivan小姐來到很早
So either Miss Sullivan arrived very early,

402
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,301
所以我們已經來的太晚了
So we're already too late.

403
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:06,873
所以她昨天就出去了
That's where she was going yesterday.

404
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,520
所以如果她昨晚8點鐘前進來
So if she came in before 8:00 last night,

405
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:15,634
所以你就讓你姐姐代你去死 沒得談 Stan
So you took your sister's life instead. No deal, Stan.

406
00:44:39,672 --> 00:44:41,606
所以你就朝你姐姐頭部開槍
So you shot your sister in the head?

407

415
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:44,490
說得好 Ross小姐 不過這次不行 這次搜查是非法的
Nice try, Miss Ross. Not this one. The search was illegal.

416
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,373
誰都不許提及在公寓中發現的東西
There will be no mention of anything found in that apartment.

是那一發型

No. But Mr. Gillum's brief fails to mention

441
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,947
是的 不過確實是那個女人
Yeah. But it was the other one.

442

00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,520
失蹤人口科沒有她的資料
There's nothing at Missing Persons.

451
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,717
審理本案的法官認同本案確實應宣布審判無效
The trial judge thought a mistrial was necessary here.

452
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:05,564

如果我們下次開聽證會
If we have another hearing,

464
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:47,792
如果我八點鐘就離開了 說明我對這男的不是滿意
If I left at 8:00 a.M., I wasn't too impressed.

465
00:38:42,257 --> 00:38:45,158
如果他可以就訴訟地位問題重新提起訴訟
If he can re-litigate the standing issue,

466
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:46,765
如果您準許我們重新開審本案
if you will allow us to reopen the case.

467
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,447
如果你10秒內離開這里
If you leave in the next 10 seconds,

468
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,726
如果公訴方連誰殺誰都沒弄明白
If the People don't even know who killed whom,

469
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:24,071
讓一下

So what happen? She walked in on you with her husband?

471
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:17,668
然后想起來我把些書落在我辦公室里
then remembered I'd left some books in my office.

472
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:25,121
然后我就回酒店小憩
Then I went back to the hotel to take a nap.

473
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:08,275
然后棄尸于哈德遜河中 搶劫犯干的
And dumped into the Hudson. Mob hit.

474
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:08,637
然后看著他突然帶著個來路不明的證人
while he springs surprise witnesses,

475
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,318
然后按2500美元賣到海外市場
sell it overseas for 2,500.

476
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,713
然后 我送他回去
Afterwards, I dropped him off at his place.

477
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:30,034
然而卻可以采納
And that the evidence was nevertheless

478
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,956
確實是Brenda 她等下會回電話給你的
It's Brenda. She'll call you back.

479
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:08,855
確實可以和兇器及上面的指紋聯系起來
access to the murder weapon and fingerprint.

480
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:17,840
確實會導致她自證其罪
Which would have incriminated her.

481
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,648
卻判錯人
judging the wrong person?

482
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,791
去問她自己丈夫辦公室的地址呢
for directions to her own husband's office?

483
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:55,200

能否趨前 法官大人

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,418
難道你在新澤西沒得吃嗎 副隊
Don't they have food in New Jersey, Lieutenant?

615

那有沒記錄住戶籍貫

619
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,307
那也算不上什么大事 所以...
What else is new? So...

620
00:44:47,782 --> 00:44:49,340
那樣我們就可以遠走高飛了
so that we could get away.

621
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,330
那樣或許還有人記得她

那些照片呢
And the photos?

那些男孩都是Joanne喜歡的那類

624
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:47,752
那我也可以就緊急偵查問題重新提起訴訟
I can re-litigate the plain-sight issue.

I don't think we've heard anything new today.

626
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:03,013
那我就上訴
So I'll appeal.

627
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:16,761
那我就當你沒看見
I'll take that as a no.

628
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:41,429
那我得說本案顯然存在合理懷疑
I'd say reasonable doubt is manifest.

那你得和她一起下到大廳去

640
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,779
那么在不久前有人用過咯 是吧

No fixed address. Mystery boyfriend. Vague job.

663
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:42,261
沒有多少會計師知道
Not a lot of CPAs know when mascara

664
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:08,697
沒有登記
happened to move into her

665
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:32,938
沒有 我是七點之前到的
No. And I got there before 7:00.

666
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,151
沒有 你們覺得是他殺了她嗎
No. Do you think that he killed her?

667
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:03,073
沒有 沒有男朋友 不管是不是"父母同意的"那類人
Nope. Nobody, ready for Mom and Dad or not.

668
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:04,487
沒有 還沒聊那么深
No, that didn't come up.

669
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:06,065
沒問題 只要某人盡快離開
Sure. Soon as somebody leaves.

670
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:25,445
沒人在這里
Nobody here.

671
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:43,141
沒人在 來問下隔壁吧
Nobody home. Let's ask the neighbors.

672
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:50,082
沒錢包 沒身份證 沒衣服
No purse. No identification. No clothes.

673
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:53,022
沒那么藐視
Just a little.

674
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:45,848
沒錯
Yeah.

675
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,496
沒錯
That's right.

676
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:35,575
沒錯
That's right.

677
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,487
沒錯 只要你玩21點時想騙錢
Yeah, if you cheat at blackjack.

678
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:22,960
沒錯 我們一直都在密切觀察 
We were keeping our eyes open, yes.

679
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:29,515
沒錯 所以有這么多靚女來拜訪你
Right. That's why so many beautiful women come to visit you.

680
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:12,164
沒 沒有 我不覺得見過她
No. No, I don't think so.

681
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:02,497
輪到你盤問證人 Ross小姐
Your witness, Miss Ross.

682
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,221
樓下大廳有人說見過她
Somebody down the hall said they saw her

683
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:01,710
立即由第47審判庭重新審判
to part 47 for a new trial forthwith.

684
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,264
理所當然啊
Well-deserved.

685
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,634
離開一個男人的公寓
a man's apartment at 8:00 in the morning,

686
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:57,857
來看看 三號電梯在 凌晨3:07開始休眠
Let's see, car three timed out at 3:07 a.m.

687
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:12,287
肯定在這里
Definitely here.

688
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,941
客廳平面圖和視線的圖紙
of room layouts and sight lines,

689
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:55,163
可正是你們宣稱我當事人
But you're the one that alleges my client was having an affair

690
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:03,279
可這是在搜查的幾天之前
Several days before the search.

691
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,090
可這里登記的人只有你一個
There's only one of you registered here.

692
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,728
可這就會導致我當事人自證其罪
Not without incriminating my client,

693
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,805
可以作為對Sullivan小姐的不利證據來使用
Evidence against Miss Sullivan is admitted.

694
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:32,690
可以
Sure.

695
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:30,986
可我覺得法庭的事不是應該在這里忙嗎
Oh, and I thought our business was here.

696
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:56,234
可她也不害怕坐地鐵
She wasn't afraid to ride the subway.

697
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,944
可她不告訴我
If only she'd told me.

698
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:19,362
可他們是不可以拋開憲法這么干的
but they're not allowed to throw out the Constitution to do so.

699
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,238
可是他發誓如果沒檢查過她的信用卡和簽名
but he swears he wouldn't have cashed the check

700
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,873
可是撤銷指控也太過分了
Dismissal of the charge was excessive.

701
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,036
可槍是放在他頭頂兩尺的地方
On a shelf two feet over his head.

702
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:34,112
可你只看到她幾秒鐘
But you only saw her for a few seconds?

703
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,248
可你帶來了什么東西給我們
but you have something for us?

704
00:41:57,832 --> 00:42:00,700
可沒授權你像辯護律師那樣訊問證人
He's not entitled to sound like the defense attorney

705
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:50,383
可當她在酒店現身時
But when she showed up at the hotel,

706
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,051
考慮到判決被撤銷的情況
Given the circumstances of the order to dismiss,

707
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,829
看起來像是子彈穿過了耳部 但沒有創射出口
Looks like a bullet went in behind the ear. No exit wounds.

708
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,205
看來我們要找一堆
So we're going to get a lot of diagrams

709
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:13,849
看來我得學會不要那么敏感才行啊
Guess I'll have to unlearn some of my sensitivity training.

710
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,910
就住進她姐姐的客房這事 很怪嗎
sister's hotel room without registering?

711
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,474
就這樣 就這么懸在衣柜邊上
Like that? Just dangling on the edge like that?

712
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:25,111
就這事 你和William Dunbar是一起的
Here's what's going on. You and William Dunbar.

713
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,398
就在你妹妹被謀殺兩天之前
two days before your sister was murdered?

714
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:46,271
就在幾天前 她在早上八點鐘離開了
Couple of days ago, she came walking out of here at 8 a.m.

715
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,596
就在幾分鐘后
a few minutes later.

716
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,793
就在第一次審判前的聽證會上
at a hearing before the first trial.

717
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,704
就因為一個年輕女士受不了玩笑話
Because a young woman can't take a joke?

718
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,710
就算他簽了 他也沒給他簽名標個星號
If he signed in, he didn't mark his name with a star.

719
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:04,425
就是這支槍 就是這支槍把你妹妹殺了
This is it. This is the gun that killed your sister.

720
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,627
就是這女人 就是這倆人
That's her. And that's him with her.

721
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,422
就是些行李箱和衣服
Yeah, just suitcases and clothes.

722
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,269
就是死者啦 這是我們能搞到的最清晰的照片了
The late lamented. That's the best picture we have.

723
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,183
就是死者
The victim?

724
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:21,569
就是那里之類的地方
It was someplace like that.

725
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:38,859
就是每天上班8小時
eight hours a day, period.

726
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,309
就如你剛才所說的
You just said it does.

727
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,238
就幾秒而已
Just a few seconds?

728
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:17,730
就會變成自證其罪的 不行
the alleged motive for this crime. No.

729
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:50,154
酒店電話記錄顯示下午四點有個電話
Hotel phone records. 4:00 p.m. Call

730
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:06,804
警探...
Detective...

731
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:16,058
警探 在休庭前
Detective, before our break,

732
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,280
警方獲得證物的手段很有問題
The police seized the evidence in question

733
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:16,858
警察 你們想干什么
Police? What do you want?

734
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:19,174
經常有刑事案件的被告在無效審判后被重新起訴
Criminal defendants are re-tried after mistrials all the time.

735
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:10,637
進出口生意
Lmport-export.

736
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,442
盡管出了Marks法官這事 她還是受到懲罰了
She's going away, despite Judge Marks.

737
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:45,771
姐妹互相殘殺 最近經常見這種事啊
Sisters killing sisters. I haven't seen that for a week or two.

738
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:44,306
睫毛膏也算做企業業務支出
is allowable as a business expense.

739
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:26,807
叫Hiawatha 不 不是Hiawatha 是叫其他什么來著
Hiawatha. No, it wasn't Hiawatha. It was something.

740
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:19,206
鑒證科的指紋組在你的房間里
A fingerprint team was in your hotel room,

741
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,182
駕駛證上寫著William Dunbar
Driver's license. William Dunbar.

742
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:39,975
幾個小孩發現了他
Some kids found him.

743
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:03,377
或者也許是這里 也許是這里
Or maybe there, or maybe there.

744
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,342
會對審判造成極大損害
at this stage of the proceedings.

745
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:26,436
換問題 McCoy先生
Change the subject, Mr. McCoy.

746
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:08,794
忽視了他自己案件中的事實
of the facts of his own case.

747
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,694
哼 對 Perkles先生
Yeah, right. Mr. Perkles!

748
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:42,222
很像和我通過電話的一個人
I might have talked to on the phone.

749
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:49,303
很漂亮的襯衫 很少見這種織物用單層絲的
Lovely blouse. Rare to see single-ply silk with that texture.

750
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:56,381
很好
That's good.

751
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:48,033
很好 Bedford Hills女子監獄有空鋪位接待這類人的
Good. There'll be a place for this one at Bedford Hills.

752
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,991
很不情愿地把這件事交給我處理
brought this matter to me with some reluctance.

753
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,714
嘿 要是以前你在吃飯時間按電梯想下去 
Hey, used to be you'd ring to go down at lunch time

754
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,725
嘿 我們會去主動問的
Hey, we'll knock on doors.

755
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,046
嘿 幫我個忙
Hey, do me a favor.

756
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,532
嘿 Shapiro
Hey, Shapiro!

757
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:48,135
和Dunbar偷情
to meet Dunbar for a little fun and games.

758
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,352
何必這么麻煩呢 McCoy先生
Why reinvent the wheel, Mr. McCoy?

759
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:42,542
好像在他們上彈時
Like it slipped through somebody's fingers

760
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,357
好像運行的是三號和五號
Looks like cars three and five responded.

761
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:15,777
好讓他贏一件他本來就該輸的案子
to win a case he should have lost the first time?

762
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:39,865
好讓他們可以以保安疏漏為由起訴大樓保管處
so they can sue the building for inadequate security.

763
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,414
好了 那就對了 Lennie
Well, that's it, Lennie.

764
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:19,683
好了 看"對Joanne Dunbar的逮捕令"
Here we go. "Warrant out for the arrest of Joanne Dunbar,

765
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,133
好啦 我拿到全部報告了
Okay, I got all the reports.

766
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:19,709
好極了
Terrific.

767
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:24,249
好的 你老板在Tampa 謝了
Right. Your boss is in Tampa. Thanks.

768
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,084
好的 Gillum先生 請繼續盤問證人 還有其他問題嗎
Good. Mr. Gillum, he's your witness. Any more questions?

769
00:32:54,818 --> 00:32:57,514
好吧 那就改成重新提起訴訟
Fine. With leave to re-present.

770
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:47,616
行了 謝謝 再見
Fine. Thanks. Goodbye.

771
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:07,508
還有什么事嗎 Adam
Anything else, Adam?

772
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,990
還有其他問題嗎 McCoy 先生
Anything else, Mr. McCoy?

773
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,319
還有沒什么要說的 Ross小姐
Anything else, Miss Ross?

774
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,083
還有406間房等著查
Four hundred and six.

775
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:12,002
還有 我希望你退出這次審判
Yes. I'd like you to step down from the trial.

776
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,310
還有 McCoy先生 我還沒來得及祝賀你
By the way, Mr. McCoy, I never had a chance to congratulate you

777
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,382
還要知道什么在哪里 誰站在什么上面
and what was where and who was standing on top of what.

778
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:22,966
還是一起來談談吧
Let's talk about it.

779
00:43:38,456 --> 00:43:41,238
還是想接受司法行為委員會調查
or be facing the Commission on Judicial Conduct?

780
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:17,321
還發現了什么
did you find in Mr. Dunbar's apartment?

781
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,756
還得去猜誰長得像你
And we have guests who look like you.

782
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,661
國內農民也高興
Keeps the farmers happy.

783
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:35,634
古怪 你知道為什么會這樣嗎
Strange? Did you know why?

784
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:16,129
公訴方總是希望能重審他們認為是兇手的人
The public always wants to retry people they think are murderers,

785
00:34:51,343 --> 00:34:52,367
公訴方在提起這一被誤導的訴訟當中
The People aren't at fault

786
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,415
公訴方要求對您的裁決提起上訴
so that the People may appeal Your Honor's ruling.

787
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,837
公訴方請求休庭 法官大人
The People request a recess, Your Honor.

788
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,180
公訴方企圖重審此案 那我會反對的
foreseen that the People would attempt to retry.

789
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,371
公訴方當然支持重新起訴兇手
The public is certainly entitled to retry a murderer

790
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:25,728
給這些會議當群眾演員
To stand in the back and wave.

791
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,703
給我鑰匙
Give me the key.

792
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,614
給你逮捕令 以詐騙罪逮捕你的死者和Dunbar
Here are the warrants. Fraud, for your stiff and Dunbar,

793
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,371
告訴她姓名就會讓她入罪了嗎
By telling us her name?

794
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:36,870
告訴你們這些事
and tell you all about it.

795
00:43:03,536 --> 00:43:05,060
干預公訴方證人
interfering with their witnesses...

796
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:33,965
干嘛要這么急
What's the rush?

797
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:09,269
分別標為H和I的物品呈上作為辯方證物
into evidence as defense exhibits H and I.

798
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:44,646
反對有效
Sustained.

799
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:42,044
反對 對方在下結論
Objection. Calls for a conclusion.

800
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:35,327
法醫檢查了你的這位無名氏
The M.E. Had a look at your Jane Doe.

801
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,929
法警會對你處罰金并請你離開法庭
A court officer will fine and have you removed from my courtroom.

802
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,344
法警 以藐視法庭罪將McCoy先生逮捕
Officer, place Mr. McCoy under arrest for contempt of this court.

803
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:58,908
法官大人...
Your Honor...

804
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:39,578
法官大人...
Your Honor...

805
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,349
法官大人
Your Honor, it would be

806
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:42,953
法官大人 這恐怕不是很合適
Your Honor, this is not appropriate.

807
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,088
法官大人 我想請求...
Your Honor, I'd like to request...

808
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,594
法官大人 我現在將這兩份
Your Honor, I offer these

809
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:25,578
法官大人 我是在忙著干活呢
Your Honor, I've been very busy.

810
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,096
法官大人 我們已經處理過這個問題
Your Honor, we dealt with that issue

811
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,709
發現了一組非常完好的指紋
and they found a very nice print

812
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:44,183
而這判決是胡扯 我肯定會很快出去的
And it was bull. I'm gonna be getting out of here soon.

813
00:33:05,296 --> 00:33:07,457
而這里唯一存在的必要性 就是McCoy先生
The only necessity here is Mr. McCoy's ignorance

814
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,696
而這個
And is this the receipt for the

815
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,278
而在這搜尋過程中 你會慣常地
And in the course of such a search, you would routinely look

816
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:18,757
而在你進入Dunbar先生的公寓前
And before your visit to Mr. Dunbar's apartment,

817
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:27,171
而在你的陳述材料中這內容占了15頁紙
And takes up 15 pages in your brief.

818
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,840
而有些男孩子從來就不是"父母同意"那類
Some boys never were.

819
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,924
而我是絕對不會同意這么做的
which I certainly am not obliged to do.

820
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:26,457
而她就可以趁機
which she has neatly replaced

821
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,950
而他又會拿來不同的圖紙
And he'll come with different diagrams,

822
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:44,091
而如果你認真點也許還真能幫上些忙
And you could be a tiny bit more helpful if you tried.

823
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
而且新的事實又打亂了他的"完美"審判
new facts disrupt his perfect trial,

824
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,655
而且你還訊問McCoy的證人
And your questions to McCoy's witnesses?

825
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,960
而且還是很靚女的那種
Good-looking ones, too.

826
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,015
而妻子當然在這件公寓里享有隱私期待
A wife certainly has an expectation of privacy in an apartment

827
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:53,711
而你就能得到個無效審判
What you can have is a mistrial.

828
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,273
而導致審判無效的責任并不在公訴方
when a mistrial has resulted through no fault of the People.

829
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,588
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

830
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:34,546
嗯 至少
Well, at least one of

831
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,735
嗯 這電梯不記得在哪里
Well, the car doesn't remember where it was.

832
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,323
嗯 也許他太安靜了
Well, maybe he was just being quiet.

833
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:15,073
嗯 他們總得找地方進貨的
Well, they have to buy it from somewhere.

834
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:58,271
嗯 所以我才能看見它 也許...也許在這里
Well, enough so I could see it. Maybe... Maybe there.

835
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:04,461
呃 我有幾天沒見到他了
Well, I haven't seen him around lately.

836
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,210
呃 Mack先生在Tampa 他周一就走了
Well, Mr. Mack's in Tampa. He left Monday.

837
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:11,814
多久沒見面了 Adam
How long has it been, Adam?

838
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:33,030
對不起 法官大人 是我的尋呼機
I'm sorry, Your Honor. It's my pager.

839
00:32:57,921 --> 00:33:00,890
對不起 不要忘了一罪不能二審
Excuse me. Jeopardy has attached.

840
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,830
對本案的事實和爭議點都更為熟悉
is familiar with the facts and issues here.

841
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:31,512
對Sullivan小姐不利的證據
admissible against Miss Sullivan.

842
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,908
對Dunbar耍的這些招數尤其不滿
this stunt really frown on it.

843
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:45,957
對
Yeah.

844
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:45,395
對
Right.

845
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,695
對 一個鄉下人
Yeah. An out-of-towner.

846
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:28,473
對 他裁決搜查是不合法的
Yeah. He ruled the search was illegal.

847
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,552
對 什么
Right. What?

848
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,793
對 去Stage Deli吃飯
Yeah, the Stage Deli.

849
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:51,544
對 差不多這個樣子
Yeah, something like that,

850
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,786
都屬于那次非法搜查的結果
is the fruit of an illegal search

851
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,573
都沒搞清楚你在起訴誰沒有關系
you didn't know what you were talking about.

852
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:39,727
都將可能被作為法庭對你不利的證據
be used against you in a court of law.

853
00:18:58,022 --> 00:19:00,617
點25口徑 還有這個
.25 caliber. And this.

854
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:54,000
地鐵地圖 她肯定是第一次來紐約
Subway map. She was new in the city.

855
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:30,600
地區檢查官
The District Attorney

856
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:32,392
得拿棍子把她們趕走
has to beat them off with a stick.

857
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:19,371
到我的辦公室來
In my chambers.

858
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:00,255
到了4:02重新運行
Went back on line at 4:02.

859
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:23,291
到底出了什么事
What happened?

860
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:36,049
當我伸手拿槍時 我就摸到了照片
When I reached for the gun, I felt them.

861
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,402
當我回來時 有一部電梯正好關門
When I got back, an elevator door was just closing.

862
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,984
當她出現時我很高興
I was so happy when she showed up.

863
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,646
當然
Of course.

864
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,351
當年Nathan Marks剛當上法官時
When Nathan Marks became a judge,

865
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,138
當你在審判過程中
when you change the rules of the game

866
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,310
當出現明顯的使審判無效的事項時
When the mistrials are a matter of manifest necessity.

867
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:13,907
但諸位不必替自己擔心
with which you need not concern yourselves,

868
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,517
但這個狹小的犯罪現場保護的很好
But it is a nice compact crime scene.

869
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:45,075
但我有自己的一套電梯失靈程序
But I got my COS Car Out Of Service program.

870
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:29,650
但我也同樣批準Gillum先生的動議
Mr. Gillum's motion is granted also.

871
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:07,463
逮捕令 由新澤西州簽署的
Arrest warrant, issued by the sovereign state of New Jersey.

872
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:33,051
大約六點左右從廁所出來
coming out of the bathroom around 6:00.

873
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,184
大廳對面的辦公室是誰的
Who has the office across the hall?

874
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:42,804
大廈保安說是你
The building superintendent says it was.

875
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,219
大街上賣手袋的黑人是怎么回事
guys that sell the handbags in the street.

876
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:38,478
大家是不是過得挺開心的啊
We're in a good mood, aren't we?

877
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,610
大家都在追我們報仇
People were looking for us.

878
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:59,312
從中西部某地來
From somewhere in the Midwest.

879
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,220
從受害者的房間打到那間辦公室
from the victim's room to that office.

880
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:43,635
從手上滑落下來的
while they were loading a gun.

881
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:44,499
從農民手里買牛油 轉手賣到阿拉伯國家
buying butter from farmers and selling it to Arabs.

882
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:10,966
從電梯門開始查吧
Start with the elevator.

883
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:53,008
穿起來肯定很舒服 意大利出品的
Must feel very nice. Italian weave?

884
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:41,779
除了Jasperson先生 他剛剛被判謀殺罪成立
All except Mr. Jasperson. He was just convicted of murder.

885
00:35:46,368 --> 00:35:49,565
除非我的同事們中有人有異議
and unless any of my colleagues feels differently...

886
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:26,462
除非她是像這樣子走進來的
Not unless she walked in like that.

887
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,670
除非她肯交罰金
If she brings her checkbook.

888
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,364
除非他有光速那么快 否則他不可能出城的
If he did leave town, he's traveling light.

889
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,534
除非你想說她把他也殺了
unless you're saying that she killed him, too.

890
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,085
除非存在著明顯的必要性 要宣布審判無效
unless there's manifest necessity for a mistrial.

891
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:08,473
出去找工作
To a new job?

892
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,445
乘坐Gray Line旅游巴
for a Gray Line bus tour.

893
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:18,181
陳年舊事了
The Ice Age.

894
00:33:29,955 --> 00:33:32,288
撤銷謀殺罪的指控
The murder charge is dismissed.

895
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,703
查下試一試看
Consider the source.

896
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,313
才讓你形成了一個心理形象
helped you form a mental image?

897
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:40,887
猜誰長得像他 這是間大酒店
And we have guests who look like him. It's a big hotel.

898
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:37,369
不知道 當時不知道 
No. Not then.

899
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:53,423
不知道 不過如果他死了 給電話通知我一聲 行不
Nope. But if he turns up dead, give me a call, will you?

900
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:29,662
不要再說了
Not another word.

901
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:57,166
不是通過排隊確認得出的 是不是
wasn't based on a lineup, was it?

902
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:15,626
不是 是Lester Korn先生
No. Mister Lester Korn.

903
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:24,489
不是 但它也把你關于犯罪動機的理論砸了個粉碎
No. It just blows apart your theory of motive,

904
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,850
不過這對他也不難
which shouldn't be hard.

905
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,646
不過我們需要你看下這些照片
but we need you to look at these pictures.

906
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:05,564
不過我不知道 我們已經沒有什么親人了
But I don't know... We don't have any relatives left.

907
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:40,562
不過她確實長得
But she does look like someone

908
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:53,744
不過她的發色更深 發型更直一些
only her hair was darker and straighter.

909
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,226
不過他不是很友好
But he's not very friendly, though.

910
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:06,327
不過他辦公室
But he's got lots of women

911
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,643
不過你妹妹察覺到了
But your sister, she figured it out

912
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,174
不過經營賭場的那些聰明人
but the wise guys who run some of the places Dunbar's pulled

913
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,259
不管他叫Johnson還是其他啥名字 這家伙什么產品都有
Johnson, or whatever his name is, had all the forms.

914
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:32,859
不管你在嬉戲些啥
Whatever kind of romp you've been up to...

915
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:22,371
不對 那地名是法國名字
No, that's French.

916
00:34:59,418 --> 00:35:02,478
不懲罰她不足以泄民憤 謝謝
It would be repugnant to reward her. Thank you.

917
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,387
不必你請求
No need.

918
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:02,726
不 這難道還夠不明顯嗎 她在躲避某些人
No. Isn't it obvious? She was hiding from somebody.

919
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,940
不 我沒有
No, it didn't.

920
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,185
不 她這么做就會強化這一所謂的犯罪動機
No, she won't incriminate herself by strengthening

921
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,593
不 她沒有結婚
No, she wasn't married.

922
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:31,370
不 他們跨過了國際日期變更線
No, they're across the date line.

923
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,678
不 是我朋友 Brenda 的電話 她很崇拜警察
No, it's my friend, Brenda. She loves policemen.

924
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,414
不 是那個長得比較帥的警察
No, the other one's the cute one.

925
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,746
不 如果我妹妹死了 我要知道怎么回事
No. If my sister is dead, I want to know.
