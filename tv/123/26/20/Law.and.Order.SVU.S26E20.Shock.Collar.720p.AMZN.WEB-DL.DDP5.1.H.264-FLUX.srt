9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:23,022
I want to stay home.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,066
I know, baby.

11
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,372
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,200
I know you don't feel good.

13
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:30,030
We're going to swing by
the doctor's office, OK?

14
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,993
How about if we
play a game, huh?

15
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:39,081
You pick.

16
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:40,952
How about "what am I?"

17
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:42,389
Oh, that's a good one.

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,306
I'm chubby, yellow,
and nobody likes me.

19
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:49,874
Oh, hmm, a bumblebee?

20
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,572
No, a school bus.

21
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:52,877
Ha ha.

22
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:05,890
Mom.

23
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,370
Just give me a minute, Haley.

24
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,721
When are we going to the doctor?

25
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:12,201
Just one more stop, OK?

26
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:13,289
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,508
Wait, wait.

28
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:15,770
Can you please put the heat on?

29
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,032
I'm cold.

30
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:18,381
OK, all right.

31
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:20,254
I'll be two seconds.

32
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,711
Sorry. I had the music on.

33
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,929
It's OK. Here's
your breakfast.

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,583
Thanks. Cady, right?

35
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:47,629
Yeah.

36
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,240
It's all there.
- Sorry.

37
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:52,850
Last time, they
screwed up my order.

38
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,244
Oh, yeah.

39
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:58,378
We good?
- All good.

40
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,770
Let me just get you a tip.

41
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,902
Thank you.

42
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,513
I've got to get going.

43
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,603
- There you go.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,998
- Hey, is that your car?
- Hmm?

45
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,956
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,698
Haley! Haley!

47
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:15,656
My car!

48
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:16,787
Someone just stole my daughter!

49
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,441
Haley! Haley!

50
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,661
Haley!

51
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:22,489
God! Haley!

52
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,533
No!

53
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,187
Help me, someone, God...

54
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:30,801
I'm so glad that
this worked out.

55
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,107
I know.

56
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,413
Look at us getting to
walk our kids to school.

57
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:34,718
Like a couple of regular moms.

58
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,980
I wanted to thank you, though.

59
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,243
For?

60
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,244
For getting my girls
into this program.

61
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,375
Oh, come on, Amanda.

62
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,681
They're gifted,
just like their mom.

63
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,335
Mom, my case, it's heavy.

64
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:43,553
OK. Well...

65
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:44,772
Don't worry. I've got it.

66
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,470
- Noah's carrying it.
- Thank you, Noah.

67
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,950
Chief.

68
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,344
Yeah.

69
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,259
OK.

70
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,999
OK. Right.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,524
So I'm actually with
Sergeant Amanda Rollins,

72
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,179
so I'll have her loop in
the Intelligence Bureau.

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,485
Understood.

74
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:03,399
Bye.

75
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,705
Who was that?

76
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,228
That was our new chief of Ds.

77
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,316
What happened?

78
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,623
Stolen vehicle on
West 88th Street.

79
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,233
And he's calling all units?

80
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,324
There was an eight-year-old
little girl in the backseat.

81
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,500
Oh, my God.

82
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,720
Mom, is everything OK?

83
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,895
Yeah, honey.

84
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,244
Amanda and I just
have to run to work.

85
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,203
So I'll see you
after school, OK?

86
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,682
Have a great day.
- I will.

87
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,031
- All right.
- I love you.

88
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,469
I love you.

89
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,210
Captain. Sergeant.

90
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,341
Chief Barone.

91
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:33,777
Do we have an ID on
the missing girl?

92
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,126
Yes, Haley Greene.

93
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,824
Her picture and description
are out on alert.

94
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,217
- Is that the mother?
- Yeah, Cady Greene.

95
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,740
She was making a food delivery.

96
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,176
She left the car running
and the doors unlocked.

97
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,308
In New York?

98
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,483
Was she trying to
get her kid taken?

99
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:44,788
Hey, let's not rush
to judgment, OK?

100
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,268
Commissioner.

101
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,617
Yeah, I'm on the scene.

102
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:48,662
Captain.

103
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,967
We're looking at a missing girl?

104
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:50,925
Any leads?
- Not yet.

105
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:51,969
Full mobilization, OK?

106
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,970
You know the drill.

107
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,015
Yeah, find witnesses.

108
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,364
Pull traffic cams.

109
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:56,539
The mother was making
a food delivery.

110
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,238
Maybe the guy saw something.
- Copy.

111
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,110
Ms. Greene, I'm
Captain Benson.

112
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,677
This is Sergeant Rollins.

113
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,809
- I... I left her for a minute.
- OK.

114
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,289
Can you tell us
exactly what happened?

115
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,073
I mean, maybe whoever it
was thought that they were

116
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,640
just stealing a car, you know?

117
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,033
Maybe they didn't realize that
Haley was in the backseat.

118
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,252
That's a possibility.

119
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,340
Maybe they're just
going to push her

120
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:15,732
out of the car, you know?

121
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,734
So here's what's going to
happen next, all right?

122
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,823
We're going to take you
down to the station,

123
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,043
and I want you to
focus all your energy

124
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:24,263
on telling us exactly
what you remember,

125
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,612
exactly what happened, OK?

126
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,440
And what if they
bring Haley back here?

127
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,442
Or what if she
goes home somehow?

128
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,444
We have detectives here
covering the scene.

129
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,836
We have them at your apartment.

130
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,621
So if she comes back,
we will know about it.

131
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:35,970
OK.

132
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,928
So is there anybody that
we can call for you?

133
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:40,104
Is there a friend or, you
know, boyfriend, husband?

134
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,192
No.

135
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,498
No, it's just Haley and me.

136
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,108
- OK.
- You have to find her, please.

137
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:45,459
We will. We will.

138
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:36,117
You said you spoke with
the mother earlier?

139
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,641
She was hysterical,
understandably.

140
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:40,077
Did you see who stole her car?

141
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:42,906
I am sorry. I wasn't
paying attention

142
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,821
until I heard the
mother screaming.

143
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:46,562
Anything you saw at
all would be helpful.

144
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,785
Once I looked up the street,
I did see a white van.

145
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:54,527
- A van?
- Yeah, like a rental van.

146
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,485
It was following
the woman's car.

147
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:57,704
That's great. Thank you.

148
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:58,879
Yeah.

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,750
Poor Cady. I can't
even imagine.

150
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,187
- You know her name?
- Yeah.

151
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:06,408
She delivers my breakfast from
96th Street Diner twice a week.

152
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,931
Did you happen to
see her little girl

153
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,803
or who took the car?

154
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,587
I didn't even know
she had a daughter.

155
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,067
If I knew there was
a kid in the car,

156
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,111
I never would have
made her wait.

157
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,113
Wait? What do you mean?

158
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,506
I went back inside
to get my wallet.

159
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,855
I wanted to give her a tip.

160
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,117
Well, if you wanna help us,

161
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,468
we're going to need
your Ring cam footage.

162
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,252
Sure, no problem.

163
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,733
Just give me a second.

164
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,299
I mean, I had to work.

165
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,650
I can't just take the day off
'cause my daughter's sick.

166
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,912
I don't have any
family in the area.

167
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,392
I can't afford child care.

168
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,916
OK, no one's blaming
you, Ms. Greene.

169
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,787
And we don't want you
to blame yourself.

170
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,138
Who would take my little girl?

171
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,010
Well, like you said, it
is possible that this

172
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,925
was a random car theft.

173
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:47,971
Can I ask you why you
left the car running?

174
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,320
Well, it was cold out.

175
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,626
She was sick.

176
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:51,975
I left the heat on.

177
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,803
And the doors were unlocked?

178
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:56,023
I mean, it was a
nice neighborhood.

179
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,807
She was 20 feet away.

180
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,331
So there's two possible
scenarios here, right?

181
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,594
The door was unlocked,

182
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,074
so either this was a
crime of opportunity,

183
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,468
or somebody targeted
your daughter.

184
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,818
Is there anyone in your
life who's close to Haley

185
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,212
that you might suspect
of something like that?

186
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,387
No, no.

187
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,476
A relative? A nanny?

188
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,999
A babysitter?

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,132
Like I said, I can't
afford childcare.

190
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,700
And what about Haley's father?

191
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:21,831
Dylan?

192
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,398
Is he in the picture?

193
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,487
Haley only spends about a
weekend a month at his place.

194
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:26,749
And why is that?

195
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,490
He gigs a lot.
He's a musician.

196
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:32,102
Are you and Dylan in any
kind of custody dispute?

197
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,974
No.

198
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,584
Do you think that
he would do this?

199
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:38,152
When is the last time
you spoke with Dylan?

200
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,501
Uh...

201
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,677
it was Valentine's Day.

202
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,505
He took Haley out for ice cream.

203
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:47,683
OK, how about we give him a
call right now on speaker, OK?

204
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,167
<i>Hey, what's up? It's Dylan.</i>

205
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,821
<i>You know what to do.</i>
- What do I do?

206
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:55,952
Tell him to call you back.

207
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,390
Hey, Dylan, this is Cady.

208
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:03,220
Can you just call me back
as soon as you get this?

209
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:06,833
Uh, Cady, is there anything
that might give you pause

210
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:10,663
about him spending
time with Haley?

211
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,275
No, never.

212
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,887
Hey, any luck tracking down

213
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,628
Haley's birth
father, Dylan Reed?

214
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,456
No, we haven't been able to
get a ping off his cell phone.

215
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,066
Seems a little
shady, doesn't it?

216
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,590
Detectives in Brooklyn
went to his apartment.

217
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,026
Nobody was home.

218
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,158
They left an unmarked on
his block in case he shows.

219
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,073
And no sign of Cady's red sedan?

220
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,511
I'm still pulling up
traffic cam footage.

221
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,251
Rollins, anything
from intelligence?

222
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,688
Yeah, we're tracking
Haley's image across

223
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,951
multiple digital footprints.
- What do you think?

224
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,822
Whoever took her posted a photo?

225
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,607
- We've seen it before.
- Got something.

226
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,392
TARU's been going through
Ring cam footage on the block,

227
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,526
and they have an
image of the driver.

228
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,224
It looks like a woman.

229
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,182
Trying to hide her face.

230
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,663
<i>From the wave, it seems
like she knows Cady.</i>

231
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,883
<i>We're not just looking
at a carjacking anymore.</i>

232
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,408
Well, the witness we spoke to
mentioned a white moving van

233
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,931
following Cady's
car up the block

234
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,106
right after the abduction.

235
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,587
So do we think it's connected?

236
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,849
The van driver could have

237
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,547
just been waiting
for traffic to clear.

238
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,940
Well, whoever's driving
Cady's car is obscured,

239
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,942
so we won't get anything
off facial recognition.

240
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,379
But we still need
to show it to Cady.

241
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,468
Yeah.

242
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,383
You said she waved at Haley?

243
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah, it seems like
they know each other.

244
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,300
I have never seen this
woman before in my life.

245
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,303
Maybe it's a neighbor
or somebody from school.

246
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:30,046
Is it possible that her
father had a girlfriend

247
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:31,831
that he didn't tell you about?

248
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,311
Look, I know you probably
think that I'm a bad mother,

249
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,444
but I know everyone
in my daughter's life.

250
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,794
We don't think that
you're a bad mother, Cady.

251
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,014
Captain? Sergeant?

252
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:43,147
Excuse us for a minute.

253
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:47,107
You got a lead?

254
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,630
Yeah, the unis found Cady's car.

255
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,849
Where?

256
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,938
Near an overpass
on Riverside Drive.

257
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:55,681
- Captain Benson?
- Yeah.

258
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:56,856
Sergeant Grasso.

259
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:58,248
You manage to
recover the plates?

260
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,598
Notified you guys as
soon as we ran it.

261
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,555
Who called it in?

262
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:01,643
Sanitation guy.

263
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:02,644
Fire Department responded.

264
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,950
OK.

265
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,953
Velasco, Silva, see
if he saw anything.

266
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:11,653
All right, whoever
set this car on fire

267
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,133
didn't just walk away.

268
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:15,831
So pull all the pole
cam security footage.

269
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,877
All right, open the trunk.

270
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,313
There's nothing left, Captain.

271
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,619
We got to see for ourselves.

272
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,664
Look, we're looking
for a little girl.

273
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,151
Well, she's not here.

274
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,718
Yeah, car burned like
this, if there were a body,

275
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,415
there'd be some remains.

276
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,636
OK, so whoever took the car
knows NYPD is looking for them.

277
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,466
So the question is, what
did they do with Haley?

278
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:50,344
Silva, where are we on
the pole cam footage?

279
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,867
TARU says that they're
still working on it.

280
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:52,912
OK.

281
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,740
I'll put a call in to the chief.

282
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,698
And what about the sanitation
worker who called in the fire?

283
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,092
Didn't see anyone matching
the description of the woman

284
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,702
driving the car or Haley.

285
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,704
Unis are still canvassing
Riverside Drive.

286
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,706
All right, I sent
Curry and Velasco

287
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,186
to the forensic garage.

288
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:09,189
You know, hopefully, they
get lucky with evidence.

289
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,368
Silva, is there anything else?

290
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,978
Just thinking.

291
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,111
We haven't been able to reach
Haley's father, Dylan, yet.

292
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,721
OK. Nothing from the uni

293
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,201
who we posted
outside his building?

294
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,551
No, the guy seems to be MIA.

295
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,249
OK, well, head to Brooklyn

296
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,729
and bang on his
neighbors' doors.

297
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,122
Somebody's got to
know something.

298
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,864
Copy that, Captain.

299
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,916
Tell me about your neighbor
Dylan and his daughter.

300
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,222
Dylan's cool.

301
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,745
I've met his daughter.

302
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,530
Do you know that she's missing?

303
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,576
What? No.

304
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:51,187
Do you think Dylan knows?

305
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:53,059
I-I have no idea.

306
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,756
I haven't talked to him.

307
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,890
His ex, Cady, has been
calling and leaving messages.

308
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,587
He's not answering
or calling her back.

309
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,067
You don't think he had something

310
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,372
to do with his
daughter being missing?

311
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,113
- Any reason we should?
- No.

312
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:05,680
I mean, I don't think so.

313
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,900
I think Dylan's a decent guy.

314
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,772
But I guess you can
never really know people.

315
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,818
Do you have any idea
where he is right now?

316
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,210
No.

317
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,778
He travels for work,
always has a gig somewhere.

318
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,041
When's the last
time you saw him?

319
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,609
Yesterday morning.

320
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,134
Yeah, he left with his
guitar and got in a van.

321
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,267
A white van?

322
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:29,052
Yeah, I think so.

323
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,838
OK, just got pole cam footage...

324
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,665
picked up that white moving van.

325
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,233
So the van wasn't just
stuck in traffic behind

326
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,452
a double-parked vehicle?

327
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,933
No, it was following Cady's car.

328
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,717
I can't see the guy's face.

329
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,633
So it looks like we're looking
for a male-female team.

330
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:48,027
Find anything in that
scorched vehicle?

331
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,769
You mean this tin can you guys
towed down from Riverside?

332
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,379
All that's left is the plates.

333
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,033
So I'm guessing no DNA?

334
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:56,252
Blaze like that? Not a chance.

335
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:57,601
How'd the fire start?

336
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,994
Point of origin
was the front seat.

337
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,387
Looks like someone
soaked the cushion

338
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,736
with nail polish remover.

339
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,433
Lit a match.

340
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:04,565
How do you know
the accelerant was

341
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,306
nail polish remover?

342
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,962
Uni found this tossed in a
sewer grate near the scene.

343
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,659
Is it possible it
belongs to Cady?

344
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,965
Either her or the kidnapper.

345
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,662
See if the lab can
get prints off it.

346
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,143
We'll ask Cady if it's hers.

347
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,187
They burned my car?

348
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,623
Where's Haley?

349
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,103
No, no, she was not in the
car when it was burned.

350
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,452
We've confirmed that.

351
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:23,671
We're still investigating,
but we did recover

352
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:24,977
a bottle of nail polish remover.

353
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,587
Was that yours?
- No, no.

354
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,806
I don't have time
to do my nails.

355
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,677
OK. We also got a picture,

356
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:33,159
an image from a pole
cam near the scene.

357
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,422
So...

358
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:36,989
you recognize this man?

359
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,729
No. No, not at all.

360
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,035
You said that Dylan
was a musician.

361
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,950
Maybe it was one of his friends?

362
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,517
I don't know any
of his bandmates.

363
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:44,953
OK.

364
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,389
'Cause we haven't been able
to get a hold of Dylan.

365
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,782
He hasn't called us back.

366
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,523
He hasn't even been
by his apartment.

367
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,438
OK, is there any
place you can think of

368
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,396
that he may have gone?

369
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:55,703
You know, maybe he had a gig.

370
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,052
I wish I knew.

371
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,315
I don't know.

372
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:00,882
OK.

373
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:01,883
How about you call him?

374
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,102
Let's call him right now, OK?

375
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,931
- OK.
- Let's call him again.

376
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,367
<i>- Hey, what's up?</i>
- Mm-mm.

377
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:08,890
<i>It's Dylan. You
know what to do.</i>

378
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,413
God.

379
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,850
Dylan, hi, it's me again.

380
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,155
Can you please call me back?

381
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,374
It's about Haley.

382
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,767
Call me.

383
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,249
OK.

384
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,036
Thanks, Corgan.

385
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,299
Keep me updated.

386
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:31,565
Well, I take it from
that look, no leads.

387
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,175
There's nothing on social media.

388
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,612
Corgan is looping
in NicMec, the Feds,

389
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:37,310
checking child
pornography sites.

390
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,181
Look, it's been a few hours

391
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,053
since we found that
car heading north.

392
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,924
Well, we know Haley didn't
get on a commercial flight.

393
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,621
So far, there's been
nothing from the alerts

394
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:46,623
at train and bus
stations in the vicinity.

395
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,147
Captain, Sergeant.

396
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,889
Dylan Reed, Haley's
father, just showed up.

397
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,110
Mr. Reed.

398
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,243
Hey. What the hell's going on?

399
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,419
I get home, and there's
a cop car at my place.

400
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,203
Where you been?

401
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,162
At a recording session.

402
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,815
For the last 24 hours?

403
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,296
Yeah, for a weight loss drug.

404
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,777
Why weren't you
answering your phone?

405
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,952
No phones allowed.

406
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,432
Have you talked to Cady?

407
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,999
'Cause she's been calling you.

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,957
I got her messages as soon
as I got out of the studio.

409
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,264
I called her back, got sent
straight to her voicemail.

410
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,788
Mr. Reed, do you know
where your daughter is?

411
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,572
Because she's missing.

412
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,139
What are you talking about?

413
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,620
Cady's car was stolen, and
Haley was in the backseat.

414
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,100
Oh, my God.

415
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,580
When is the last time you
spoke with your daughter?

416
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,105
Um,

417
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,236
Valentine's Day.

418
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:35,803
I took her for ice cream.

419
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,458
And you haven't seen her since?

420
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,981
I've been on the road.

421
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,983
OK, so my question to you is,

422
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,072
is there anyone that
you can think of

423
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,727
that may have taken
your daughter?

424
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:47,989
What are you
talking about? No.

425
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,643
Is there anybody in
your life that's shown

426
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,036
a special interest in her?

427
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,863
Look, I know I'm
not the best dad,

428
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,691
but I would never
associate with someone

429
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,998
who would hurt
Haley or take her.

430
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,652
And I sure as hell
didn't kidnap her.

431
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,088
OK.

432
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,482
We're still gonna need
to confirm your alibi.

433
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:03,744
No problem.

434
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,747
There were ten people
in that session.

435
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,663
So Dylan Reed, Haley's father,

436
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,056
is no longer a suspect.

437
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,318
You confirmed his alibi?

438
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,667
Yeah, he was in a
recording session

439
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,147
with ten other musicians.

440
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,887
No cell phone access
for the past 24 hours.

441
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,977
Doesn't have a record.
We ran his financials.

442
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,717
Yeah, it turns out he's
some kind of trust fund kid.

443
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,154
So if he did have
money problems,

444
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,851
Daddy would have been
able to bail him out.

445
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,635
So we're looking at
a stranger abduction?

446
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,855
Two strangers, a
man and a woman.

447
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,509
Cady was a delivery
person, right?

448
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,380
I've heard of drivers
getting robbed before.

449
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,729
We sure this wasn't a setup?

450
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,863
We ruled out the guy
she delivered to.

451
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,344
What?

452
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,520
Corgan just got off with NicMec.

453
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:43,175
Haley's image popped up on a
site that they were tracking.

454
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,003
- Child porn?
- Something else.

455
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,440
Can you mirror this?
- Yeah. Send the link.

456
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,923
<i>You look so pretty.</i>

457
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,273
<i>Ow. Ow!</i>

458
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:55,404
<i>Ow, that hurts!</i>

459
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,885
<i>Ow!</i>

460
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:02,585
<i>I know how much you bad boys
out there like to watch.</i>

461
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,370
<i>Well, watch this.</i>

462
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,376
Stay still while I put this
around your neck, Missy.

463
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:11,986
My name is not Missy!

464
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,727
<i>My name is Haley!
- Not anymore.</i>

465
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:16,077
<i>You're going to wear this
as long as I tell you to.</i>

466
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,166
<i>Ow! That's too tight!</i>

467
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,385
<i>Ow!</i>

468
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:21,952
<i>Here's a little
taste of what happens</i>

469
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,911
<i>if you don't do as I say.</i>

470
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,656
What are we looking at here?

471
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,528
- Torture.
- Control.

472
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:35,879
It's delegated sadism,

473
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,927
a pathology of orchestrating
acts of violence

474
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:43,235
or torture, not because
the viewers want

475
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:46,107
to participate physically,
but because they enjoy

476
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,413
the suffering itself.

477
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,241
Whoever's watching
this is paying for it.

478
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,112
Yeah, and the money
gives them power

479
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,506
not only over the victim,
but of the aggressor.

480
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,421
How many of these
sites are out there?

481
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:58,119
NicMec says they're
tracking a few dozen

482
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,555
of these content creators...

483
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:02,776
Wicked Winnie, Rowdy
Rosie, and this one.

484
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:04,256
Missy Mayhem.

485
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,388
So if NicMec knows
about these sites,

486
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,129
why don't they just
shut them down?

487
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,913
Most of them operate
out of Southeast Asia.

488
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,785
Well, we know that's
not the case here.

489
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:14,135
How long ago did this pop up?

490
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,181
Two hours after
pole cam footage.

491
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,747
It seemed like it was
being live streamed.

492
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:21,011
Which means that Haley is
less than two hours from us.

493
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,631
Oh, my God. Where is this?

494
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,546
Where is she?
- We don't know exactly yet.

495
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,547
But we have confirmation
that Haley is still alive.

496
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,985
And Cady, she's within...

497
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,943
she's within two
hours of Manhattan.

498
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:43,121
And the kidnappers put
this on the internet why?

499
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,429
There are people all over
the world who will pay money

500
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,780
to see all kinds of things.

501
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:53,957
Child porn?

502
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,307
No, no, no, that's
not what this is.

503
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,351
That's not what this is.

504
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,613
Well, then, what is it?

505
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,180
Right now, we don't
think it's sexual.

506
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,966
But what we do know is that
there's a woman involved.

507
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,534
So we heard a woman's
voice on the video.

508
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,450
So we'd love to play you
this audio, if that's OK.

509
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,278
- Yeah.
- OK.

510
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,194
<i>Stay still while I put this
around your neck, Missy.</i>

511
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,543
Who... who's Missy?

512
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,371
That's not important right now.

513
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:19,810
Does this voice... does that
sound familiar to you at all?

514
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,813
No.

515
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,076
No.

516
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,472
Is there any way of telling
where the video was shot?

517
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,995
Unfortunately, no.

518
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,433
Whoever's hosting Missy
Mayhem is using a VPN.

519
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,999
How many people are
paying for this stuff?

520
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,958
They have a few hundred
subscribers worldwide.

521
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,612
How long has the
site been active for?

522
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,397
About two years.

523
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:43,965
Two years.

524
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,533
Only one video?

525
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,665
They must have deleted the
prior videos for some reason.

526
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,581
OK, we know we can't reach
the content creators,

527
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,192
but what about the subscribers?

528
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,150
I have a list of a couple
dozen who aren't using VPNs.

529
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,499
OK.

530
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,805
Please tell me we're
picking them up right now.

531
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,851
Yeah. Send me that list.

532
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,767
I have no idea who that girl is.

533
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:06,073
I've never seen her before.

534
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,553
You didn't stream
this video of her

535
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,163
being shocked by a dog collar?

536
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:12,645
And before you answer, we
already know that you did.

537
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,255
Am I in trouble?

538
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,517
You could say that.

539
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,040
She was kidnapped yesterday.

540
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,172
She's still missing.

541
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,218
I had nothing to do with it.

542
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,090
I just like watching.

543
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,570
She was in pain.

544
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:27,050
You get off on that?

545
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,791
I thought she was just acting.

546
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:32,230
You paid money to watch a
little girl get tortured.

547
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,233
That's facilitating
an assault to a felony

548
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,887
and child endangerment.

549
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:40,150
If I were you,

550
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,936
I'd start talking.

551
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,547
- Yeah, I saw that video.
- When?

552
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:46,896
Last night, but just
for a few seconds.

553
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,985
- A few seconds?
- It was an accident.

554
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,683
I was scrolling through
a porn aggregator...

555
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,685
adult porn, legal.

556
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,687
And Missy Mayhem just popped up?

557
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,732
We have evidence that you used

558
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,474
your credit card on this
site multiple times,

559
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:00,997
which is illegal.

560
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:02,738
Yes, before I realized
that she was underage.

561
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,436
I can't have anything
to do with kiddie porn.

562
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,134
I'm a pediatric dentist.

563
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,658
I only saw her
once this morning.

564
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,051
I shut it right off.

565
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:13,401
Mr. Kauffman, we have
evidence that you've been

566
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,055
a subscriber of the
Missy Mayhem site

567
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,231
for the past two years.
- I am.

568
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,538
But that's not Missy Mayhem.

569
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,758
I liked the original
Missy Mayhem better.

570
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,586
The original Missy Mayhem?

571
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:27,415
She was the only
girl on the site.

572
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,243
They deleted all her posts.

573
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,593
- Why?
- I have no idea.

574
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,247
Is there anything else
that you could tell us

575
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,422
about this other girl?

576
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,250
What she looked like, her age?

577
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,470
She was a little older.

578
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:41,299
I'd probably get banned from
the site if they found out,

579
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,216
but I actually screen-recorded
some of her videos.

580
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,311
<i>That's a good girl.</i>

581
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:00,318
<i>I'm glad you cleaned
up your room.</i>

582
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,623
<i>You want a snack?</i>
- What is she doing?

583
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:02,929
It's called clicker training.

584
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,713
They use it to teach
dogs obedience.

585
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,846
This is the same woman's voice.

586
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,718
<i>I'll be back in a
minute with your treat.</i>

587
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:12,460
And this is the
original Missy Mayhem?

588
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,680
Yeah, one of the
pervs we talked to had

589
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,377
a few dozen of these
videos recorded,

590
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,683
all of the same girl.

591
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,162
Is there anything that
we know about her?

592
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:21,382
Well, NicMec ran
facial recognition.

593
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,645
She's not on any other
sites, and there's no record

594
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,168
of her being reported missing.

595
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,605
All of these videos are similar?

596
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:27,910
Pretty much.

597
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,782
Different scenarios,
all degrading.

598
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,827
In one, she was forced to
put a cone around her neck.

599
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:34,613
OK, and Haley had
a shock collar on.

600
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,616
Hold on, scroll back.

601
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,839
<i>I'll be back in a
minute with your treat.</i>

602
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,020
- Do you hear that?
- Mm.

603
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:52,674
I was raised on a
farm in Georgia.

604
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,546
That sounds like a
pack of big dogs to me.

605
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,243
Not to mention all
these similar scenarios.

606
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,375
Operant conditioning.

607
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,811
It's dog training.

608
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,682
You know, there are a lot
of dog breeders upstate.

609
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,205
OK, so we need to
narrow it down.

610
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:04,512
Do you think that your people
can identify the breed?

611
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:05,818
Based on audio?

612
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,428
You'd be surprised
by our tech advances.

613
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,039
Hey, NicMec's been monitoring.

614
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,520
Another video of
Haley just dropped.

615
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,435
<i>Lie down.</i>

616
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,871
<i>No, I don't want to.</i>

617
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,438
<i>It is time for bed.</i>

618
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,613
<i>But I don't want to.</i>

619
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,093
<i>I said, get to your bed.</i>

620
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:22,704
<i>Don't make me put this
collar on you again.</i>

621
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,795
<i>Lie down.</i>

622
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,506
<i>I'll be back in a
minute with your treat.</i>

623
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,509
- What are we looking at?
- Nothing good.

624
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,859
Right now, the sound
of those dogs barking

625
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,601
is the only lead we have in
finding two missing girls.

626
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,950
Clock is ticking.

627
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,995
Can you do something with this?
- Absolutely.

628
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:57,173
First step, put it
through Reverb RX.

629
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,740
What does that do?

630
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:02,701
It'll isolate the barking
and remove background noise.

631
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,659
<i>I'll be back in a
minute with your treat.</i>

632
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,402
Yeah.

633
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,143
All right, do you think
there's any way that we can

634
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:11,710
figure out what breed that is?

635
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,756
Believe it or not, we have
a program called the BarklD,

636
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,497
which deals mainly
in animal acoustics.

637
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,021
I'm not promising anything,
but if I had to guess,

638
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,415
I'd say we're looking at one
of the popular guard breeds.

639
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,112
You know what, call
in a behaviorist

640
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,723
from the K9 Unit if you have to.

641
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,551
I'll let you know as soon as
I have anything definitive.

642
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:27,727
Thank you.

643
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,990
You have news on Haley?

644
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,514
Well, I wish we could give
you something more concrete,

645
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,908
but we are following leads.

646
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,431
What are they?

647
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:40,390
So do you recall any
instance recently

648
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,089
where someone with a large
dog may have approached you?

649
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,438
No, no.

650
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,179
Do you know anybody
that has big dogs?

651
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,354
No.

652
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,051
Were you looking to buy a dog?

653
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:52,533
Maybe you went to a pet shop,
or a breeder, or a kennel?

654
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,274
Why are you asking me all this?

655
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,929
We found another video.

656
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,365
Another video of Haley?

657
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,193
We believe it's made
by the same people,

658
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,760
but this was of another girl.

659
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,936
So the people that
made these videos,

660
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,590
they've done this before.

661
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,113
As far as we can tell,
whoever took Haley

662
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:09,724
and this other girl, they
seem to own a lot of dogs.

663
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:13,467
And what we heard sounded
like a pack of dogs

664
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,251
in the background,
so we're thinking

665
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:17,645
that they may be dog breeders.

666
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:19,952
Well, Haley and I weren't
looking to get a dog.

667
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,606
OK.

668
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,565
Uh, would you excuse
us just for a minute?

669
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,698
Yeah.

670
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,746
Rollins.

671
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,705
We heard back from your
guy at the acoustics lab.

672
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:34,967
Yeah?

673
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,534
He narrowed down the
breed to one of three.

674
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,318
He seems to think it's
either Rottweilers,

675
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,972
Dobermans, or Cane Corsos.

676
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,844
Well, how many breeders can
there be in a two-hour radius?

677
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,977
Well, we have a short
list, most of them upstate.

678
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:45,978
Right, so head up there

679
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,109
and talk to all of them.

680
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,329
Got it.

681
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,724
Officers, take a look around.

682
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,073
Grey Hills Farm?

683
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,335
Who's listed as the owner?

684
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:56,597
Victoria and Gus Grey,

685
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,339
Cane Corso breeders
for 20 years.

686
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,601
Can I help you?

687
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:01,994
Yeah, Victoria Grey?

688
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,038
Uh, yes.

689
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,300
What's this about?

690
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:05,345
Forgive us for
not calling ahead.

691
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,738
I'm Captain Curry.

692
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:10,350
Detectives Velasco and
Silva with Manhattan SVU.

693
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,047
This is the girl that's missing?

694
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,614
- Do you recognize her?
- No.

695
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:16,008
I'm sorry.
- OK.

696
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,270
What about this girl?

697
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:18,706
No.

698
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:21,013
You said this was all the
way down in Manhattan?

699
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,318
Yeah.

700
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,146
Why would I know
anything about that?

701
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:26,192
We're just following
up on a lead.

702
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:27,628
Is this your husband?

703
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,196
Yes. Gus.

704
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,501
Where is he now?

705
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:34,374
He passed away a few years back.

706
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,595
OK. Thank you for your time.

707
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:40,685
This the girl that went missing?

708
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,774
- Mm-hmm.
- I saw the story online.

709
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,906
Well, you happen to
see her in the area?

710
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,648
No. I'm sorry.

711
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:49,824
What about this girl?

712
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:54,568
I haven't seen her either.

713
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:56,657
No ring. You're not married?

714
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,224
No.

715
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:01,009
What about a female employee
or a business partner?

716
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,924
Girlfriend?
- No.

717
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,970
I'm dating a guy.

718
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,450
Why does that matter?

719
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,890
I've never seen this girl.

720
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:13,587
Have you, Gary?

721
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,154
Uh, no. Sorry.

722
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,156
OK. What about this girl?

723
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,984
I don't think so.

724
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,725
Well, maybe she was younger.

725
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:22,727
She might have
been with a woman.

726
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:23,902
No.

727
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,599
Sorry, I don't recall.

728
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,645
OK, well, do you guys
ever go to dog shows,

729
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,168
talk to other breeders?
- Oh, yeah.

730
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,560
Sure.

731
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,171
Gary, she looks...

732
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,782
she looks like the Carwoods'
little girl, don't you think?

733
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:36,088
If you say so.

734
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,480
The Carwoods?

735
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:40,309
Rottweiler breeders,
like us, in Ellenville.

736
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,660
We cross paths with
them from time to time.

737
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,445
They brought their daughter
to a show last year.

738
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:46,881
You think that's her?

739
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:51,277
I only saw her once,
but I could swear, yes.

740
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:53,279
I think they called her Ashlynn.

741
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,150
OK, great.

742
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,978
Thank you.

743
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,240
Yeah, OK.

744
00:27:58,241 --> 00:27:59,720
We'll meet you up
there, Captain.

745
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,417
Benson and Rollins
are on their way up?

746
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:02,636
Yeah.

747
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:03,681
And in the meantime,
Benson wants us

748
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,465
to liaise with Ellenville PD.

749
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,293
To get some background
on the Carwoods?

750
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,773
According to Rollins' intel,

751
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,383
they have a couple
of hundred acres

752
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:11,819
and half a dozen
registered guns.

753
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,777
I mean, we can't
just walk in there

754
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,126
without a plan.
- No.

755
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:17,259
So that was County
Records in Ellenville.

756
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,478
They confirmed a
birth certificate

757
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,088
for a girl named
Ashlynn Carwood,

758
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:22,395
born to a Nicole and
Dennis Carwood in 2013.

759
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:25,267
OK, well, does Ashlynn have a
cell phone or any social media?

760
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:26,616
You mean other
than Missy Mayhem?

761
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,445
No, no online presence at all.

762
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,534
What's our next step?

763
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,319
Have Ellenville PD
and the state troopers

764
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,190
meet us near the property.

765
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,671
We have two young girls
potentially in danger.

766
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:39,891
We're not taking any chances.

767
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:45,723
<i>We have state troopers
surrounding the house.</i>

768
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,463
So what do we know
about the Carwoods?

769
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:49,639
Dennis and Nicole...
Rottweiler breeders,

770
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,293
no criminal record,
pay their taxes,

771
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,512
no issues with
local authorities.

772
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:54,166
We're sure this
is their daughter?

773
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,776
Yes, but she's not registered
to any of the local schools.

774
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,647
Well, she could be homeschooled.

775
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:59,214
And there's no sign of Haley?

776
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,607
No, nothing on surveillance.

777
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:01,826
Just a bunch of dogs out back.

778
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,305
And the Carwoods
are in the house.

779
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:04,698
All right.

780
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:06,918
So Rollins, Curry, and I
are gonna take the house.

781
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,355
You two, go around back.

782
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:27,590
Go!
- Let's go!

783
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,855
- NYPD.
- Stay back!

784
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,552
All right, easy. I got this.

785
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:33,858
Easy.
- Leave us alone!

786
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:34,772
I got it.

787
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,382
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

788
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:37,818
Don't touch me!

789
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:38,819
OK.

790
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,517
Let's all just take a breath.

791
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:45,347
Let's drop your
weapon, Mrs. Carwood.

792
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:46,566
It's over now.

793
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,002
It's not over!

794
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,482
OK, OK, OK, OK.

795
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,745
Leave me alone!

796
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,878
I need you to drop
the weapon, OK?

797
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,749
I need you to drop the weapon.

798
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,185
Let's take a breath.

799
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,709
OK, OK, OK, OK.

800
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,059
Drop it. Drop it.

801
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,626
There you go.

802
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:08,544
We need a bus.

803
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:10,372
Tell me where Haley is.

804
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,418
Where is she?

805
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,507
Captain, we found something.

806
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:34,483
Any sign of Ashlynn or Haley?

807
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:36,442
No. We searched the premises.

808
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:39,097
Call in the K9 Unit.

809
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:51,283
Captain!

810
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,501
What have you got?

811
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:54,155
Dog indicated here.

812
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,287
I need a shovel.

813
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:56,897
So it's a body?

814
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,290
Human?

815
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,682
Likely, yes.

816
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,141
Is that a sleeping
bag, a comforter?

817
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,971
It's a little girl's.

818
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,065
Have crime techs
secure the scene.

819
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:35,545
Copy, Captain.

820
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:41,594
Get CSU and the ME down here.

821
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:51,125
What can you tell us?

822
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,998
Multiple spiral
fractures, missing teeth.

823
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,695
Looks like broken ribs.

824
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,827
This poor girl suffered
a lot of abuse.

825
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,307
How old was she?

826
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:01,962
Small for her age,
evidence of malnutrition.

827
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:04,834
According to her growth
plates, I'd estimate about 12.

828
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,314
Can you ID her?

829
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:10,405
We ran a bone fragment
through our rapid DNA machine.

830
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:12,494
The couple you just arrested?

831
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,975
We swabbed them, got a match.

832
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:20,850
This girl is their
biological daughter.

833
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,344
Where is Haley, Mrs. Carwood?

834
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:37,998
You and your husband buried

835
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,608
your own daughter
in your backyard?

836
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:40,696
Did you kill her, too?

837
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,133
I want to know
where my husband is.

838
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:43,395
He's recovering from
surgery to remove the bullet

839
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:44,613
that you put in his stomach.

840
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:46,006
I'll be representing
Mrs. Carwood.

841
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,312
And my client is
within her rights

842
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,617
not to answer any questions.

843
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,837
Yes, she is, but she's looking

844
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:52,273
at quite a few charges...

845
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:54,014
kidnapping and murder.

846
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:57,278
So you might want to advise
her to help herself out.

847
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,413
I'll decide what
I answer, not you.

848
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,893
The only question
that I'm interested in

849
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,854
is, where is Haley?

850
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,031
Where's my wife?

851
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,947
She's at the police station
right now, being interrogated.

852
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:16,167
Our ADA says the first
one who flips gets a deal.

853
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:17,472
What kind of deal
are we talking?

854
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:19,780
Nothing until you tell
us where Haley is.

855
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,956
Your wife shot you
in the stomach.

856
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,044
She tried to kill you.

857
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,393
And you're protecting her?

858
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:27,395
My wife loves me.

859
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,049
We talked about it.

860
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,920
If the cops ever showed
up, we'd go out together.

861
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,618
It's awfully convenient
how she followed through

862
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,272
with shooting you
and not herself.

863
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:37,449
We found your daughter in a
shallow grave in the backyard.

864
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,407
Whose idea was that?

865
00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:41,018
I didn't kill her.

866
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,542
So how'd she end up dead?

867
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:47,285
She was sick of
being Missy Mayhem.

868
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,678
So you're saying
she killed herself?

869
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,811
No.

870
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:54,814
She and Nicole had
a fight about it.

871
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,990
I wasn't there.

872
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:00,037
Nicole says she pushed her.

873
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,169
It was an accident.

874
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,432
You didn't call the police?

875
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,478
We didn't want to get blamed.

876
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,871
Our ME says that
Ashlynn was abused.

877
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,396
Not by me.

878
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:12,962
No.

879
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:15,617
You just like to watch
little girls in pain.

880
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:18,098
That's how this whole
site started, right?

881
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:25,279
The site was all
my husband's idea.

882
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,151
He's the one that's
into that stuff.

883
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:30,110
So you play into his fantasy?

884
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,112
Look, we started raising Rotties

885
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,635
when we first got married.

886
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:36,073
One day, I was disciplining
one of our dogs

887
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,596
for making a mess on the carpet.

888
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:40,077
I shoved the dog's nose in it.

889
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,863
I look across the room, and
I see that Dennis is excited.

890
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,039
So...

891
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,823
so he liked to watch.

892
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:50,174
But you don't.

893
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,176
You'd rather be in control.

894
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:56,181
He liked seeing me
discipline the dogs.

895
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,184
And then

896
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,837
your own child.

897
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,143
Yeah.

898
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,927
Things changed when
Ashlynn came along.

899
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:07,669
All of a sudden, it
wasn't just a dog's nose

900
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,324
you were shoving
into the carpet.

901
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:13,937
Until Ashlynn died.

902
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:18,506
We had to replace her.

903
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,639
We make money off the site.

904
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,729
How did you choose Haley?

905
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,861
She waved at us

906
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:29,213
when we were stopped at a light,

907
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:32,216
and Dennis took that as a sign.

908
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,087
So this whole kidnapping thing,

909
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,871
this was Dennis's idea.

910
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,395
Where is this going?

911
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:40,093
Well, let me spell
it out for you.

912
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:43,357
So there's only one deal, right?

913
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,752
But there are two perpetrators.

914
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,537
First one to tell us where
Haley is gets the deal.

915
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:52,237
Now, you said you
like to be in control.

916
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:57,066
I don't think you're gonna
do too well in prison.

917
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,900
<i>All right, it's Number 2.</i>

918
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,163
Cut it open.

919
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,257
- Haley.
- Haley!

920
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:14,737
Haley?

921
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:17,957
Haley.

922
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,872
Hi.

923
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:21,961
Listen, I'm Joe. I'm
a police officer.

924
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,092
You're safe.

925
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,920
Help me.

926
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:25,921
You're gonna be OK.

927
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,228
You're OK.

928
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,709
You're safe.

929
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,972
It's OK. You're safe.

930
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:34,626
Haley, it's OK.

931
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,410
It's OK.

932
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,812
Mrs. Carwood, on the
charge of kidnapping,

933
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:47,900
how do you plead?

934
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,118
Not guilty, Your Honor.

935
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,337
People on bail?

936
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,121
Given the severity
of these crimes,

937
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:54,428
and considering the defendant
is facing additional charges

938
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:57,953
of child endangerment, assault,
manslaughter in Ulster County,

939
00:36:57,954 --> 00:36:59,912
we believe that she
is a flight risk,

940
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,131
not to mention a danger
to both the community

941
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,568
and the victim's safety.

942
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,874
We request bail in the
amount of 2 million.

943
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,225
This is Nicole Carwood's
first offense, Your Honor.

944
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,487
She has no criminal record.

945
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,576
Well, she does now, Mr. Bell.

946
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:14,143
I'm granting bail in
the amount of 2 million.

947
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:16,537
Bailiff, next case.

948
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:19,540
My client delivered on
her word, Mr. Carisi.

949
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,455
Haley Greene was found
safe and unharmed.

950
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,283
She was safe, but
she wasn't unharmed.

951
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,980
Still, there was
a deal mentioned

952
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,634
during my client's interrogation

953
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,593
with Captain Benson
and Sergeant Rollins.

954
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,943
Well, I don't know what I
can do for you, Mr. Bell.

955
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,250
We can discuss after
your client posts bail.

956
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,381
Take her.

957
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:36,035
Nicole.

958
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,471
Nicole, what's wrong?

959
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,168
Why won't you look at me?

960
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:40,822
I still love you.

961
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:43,564
Mr. Carwood, on the
charge of kidnapping,

962
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,131
how do you plead?

963
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,567
Not guilty, Your Honor.

964
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,090
People on bail?

965
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,528
Again, Your Honor, given
the severity of these crimes

966
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:52,660
and the flight risk pending
the additional charges

967
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,227
of child endangerment, assault,

968
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,663
and manslaughter
in Ulster County,

969
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,579
we request 2 million.

970
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,930
Your husband pled not guilty.

971
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,497
I'm sure his lawyer
will come crawling

972
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:05,673
to you for a deal next.

973
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:07,240
You want to talk?

974
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:08,850
Let's talk.

975
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,200
What's gonna happen to my dogs?

976
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,854
Your Rottweilers?

977
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,595
That's what you're
worried about,

978
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:16,989
not your husband, not
your murdered daughter?

979
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,904
I need my babies to
go to good homes.

980
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,993
They're in the custody of
Ulster County Animal Control.

981
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:22,690
I'm sure they're being
very well cared for.

982
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,257
Let's get back to my client.

983
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,999
Captain Benson offered me
a deal if I cooperated,

984
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,305
and I did.

985
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,002
So I want a deal
for my animals too.

986
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:32,352
Ulster County is out
of my jurisdiction.

987
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,701
I can't do anything
for your dogs.

988
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,660
Let's talk about
the New York charge.

989
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:37,966
Your client's looking at

990
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:40,229
at least 25 years
for the kidnapping.

991
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,448
Hardly a deal.

992
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,102
We could take our
chances at trial.

993
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:45,191
I guess you didn't hear about
the pending federal charges.

994
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:47,149
Producing and distributing
illegal content,

995
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,064
human trafficking?
- That was all Dennis.

996
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:50,065
Nicole.

997
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,502
I had nothing to do with that.

998
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,852
Well, I doubt the feds
are gonna see it that way.

999
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,028
But since you did cooperate,

1000
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:58,160
and we found Haley alive,

1001
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,728
I'm willing to talk to them.

1002
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,644
We're willing to change
our plea to guilty

1003
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,517
if you can drop the
federal charges.

1004
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:07,996
Done.

1005
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:09,824
What about the
manslaughter charge?

1006
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:11,304
I didn't kill my daughter.

1007
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:13,786
As I said, Ulster County
is not my jurisdiction.

1008
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:20,226
- Hey.
- Hey.

1009
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:23,403
Doctors say she's gonna be
OK, no serious injuries.

1010
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,623
So great to hear.

1011
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,582
Well, after everything
she's been through, it's...

1012
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,758
it's going to take some time.
- I know.

1013
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:33,065
I just... I want a fresh start.

1014
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:35,502
My parents just
retired to Vermont,

1015
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:36,895
so we're gonna
move in with them.

1016
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:37,896
Great.

1017
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:40,508
Thank you so much, both.

1018
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,815
I'd better get back to her.
- OK.

1019
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:45,208
Good.

1020
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,776
Dennis and Nicole Carwood
both just made deals...

1021
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:50,604
kidnapping in New York,
assault and manslaughter

1022
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,040
in Ulster County.
- How much time?

1023
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,520
Well, Carisi's still
working out the details,

1024
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,479
but they're gonna
get 25 to life.

1025
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,916
And the subscribers
we rounded up,

1026
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:59,613
they're gonna get
serious time too.

1027
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,834
- That's something.
- Yeah.

1028
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,186
It still doesn't answer
my question, though.

1029
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:11,886
How does a parent do
that to their own kid?

1030
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:17,457
You've been working this
job longer than I have.

1031
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,981
Yeah. And?

1032
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,896
You still don't know the answer.

1033
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,159
Hmm.

1034
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,336
Let's go home.
