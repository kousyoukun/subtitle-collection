00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:47,710
Oh, god.

10
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:49,612
Ugh.

Oh, my god.

No. No.

- Careful the emesis.

16
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,087
- Who puked?

17
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,389
- The apartment owner
when he discovered her.

18
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,090
Dalton rindell.

19
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:35,625
He's got a pretty
good gash to the head.

20
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:36,793
Paramedics
are with him now.

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,060
- We saw him on the way in,

22
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:39,996
But we wanted to get
a handle on what went down here

23
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,297
Before we talked to him.

24
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:43,299
- Fluids on her thigh
indicate sexual activity.

25
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,867
- The rest of the story
is written on the wall.

26
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,003
- Bludgeoned to death
from someone in a rage.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,805
From the impressions
to the skull,

28
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:50,506
I'd say you were
looking for a hammer.

29
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,475
- Rindell called 911
at 7:34 a.M.

30
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:54,310
Do you have an approximate
time of death here?

31
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:55,678
- I can give you
the exact minute.

32
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:59,649
She tried to shield
her head with her hands,

33
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:02,084
One of the blows crushed
the crystal on her watch.

34
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:03,753
- [sighs]

35
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,555
- 12:57.

36
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:07,890
- So rindell was out cold
for 6 1/2 hours--

37
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,125
That's some hit to the head.

38
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:12,061
- Well, this might
explain the perp's rage.

39
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,665
"audrey,
with eternal love, michael."

40
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:18,034
- I thought mr. Rindell's
name was dalton.

41
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:20,136
- He was having
an affair with audrey.

42
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:21,704
Michael catches
them in the act,

43
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:24,507
He attacks dalton,
kills his cheating lover.

44
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:28,311
- So the sex was consensual.

45
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,546
- Mr. Rindell...

46
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:31,814
Can you
tell us what happened?

47
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:34,250
- I was hoping
you could tell me.

48
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,652
I don't remember anything.
My head is splitting.

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,788
- Could his injury
have affected his memory?

50
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:40,356
- The neural exam
checked out fine.

51
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,792
- What exactly is the nature of
your relationship with audrey?

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,360
- Who's audrey?

53
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:46,696
- The dead woman
on your bedroom floor.

54
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,600
- We didn't
have any relationship.

55
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,468
Until I
found her this morning,

56
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:54,837
I'd never
seen her before in my life.

<i>Sync by Adriano_CSI for addict7ed</i>

- Melinda,
you got a minute?

59
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:52,172
- I was hoping to pop her in
the fridge before she goes bad.

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,241
- I'm thinking it's
dalton's story that's stinking.

61
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:55,509
- You like him for it.

62
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:57,077
- Well, there's
no sign of forced entry.

63
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:59,146
- But the victim's clothes,
purse, and I.D. Are missing.

64
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:00,614
Someone must've taken them.

65
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:02,716
- That's someone dalton
doesn't want us to know about.

66
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,785
Drug dealer, pimp...

67
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,320
- We know she had sex.

68
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,888
- I need to know
if it was with dalton.

69
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,690
You mind coming upstairs
and doing a dna swab?

70
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,058
- We letting him know why?

71
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,161
- I don't understand.
Why do you need my fingerprints?

72
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:15,262
- We take it from anyone who

73
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,897
Has legitimate
access to the apartment.

74
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,298
- Once we
eliminate the friendlies,

75
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,567
Any unidentified
print could be the perp's.

76
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,868
- Got you.
- We need you to sign this

77
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,270
So we can
search your apartment.

78
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,872
- That way we don't have
to pester a judge for a warrant.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,274
- Why would
you need to do that?

80
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:28,709
- There's no crime scene
exception

81
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:31,011
To the fourth amendment, we need
to keep our searches legal.

someone in my home.

Whatever you need to do.

84
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:36,750
But I don't get it...
Why did he pick me?

85

Have you
ever seen anything like this?

If I had a nickel
for every dead prostitute

88
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,423
I ever woke up with...?
- I've never used a prostitute.

89
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,992
- Sorry,
without gallows humor,

90
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:47,794
To cope with what we see every
day, I'd go stark raving mad.

- What do you mean go?

92
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,797
- How do you deal
with stress, mr. Rindell?

93
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:52,866
- Uh, usually I avoid it.

94
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:56,603
- Mr. Rindell, is it
okay if I take a dna sample?

95
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,739
It's just a quick swab
of the inside of your mouth.

96
00:04:58,806 --> 00:04:59,740
Won't hurt a bit.

97
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:00,941
- Routine procedure?

98
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,442
- With your permission.
- Of course.

99
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,945
- Mr. Rindell,
do you own a hammer?

100
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,113
- Uh-huh.

101
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,148
- Okay, it's
not in your tool box.

102
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,250
- Is that what he used?

103
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,386
I'm gonna be sick again.
I need some water.

104
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:13,754
- We should
get you to the hospital

105
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,822
And have you checked out.

106
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,558
- All right,
let me just grab my wallet.

107

[coughing softly]

108
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,997
- I'm not so sure
he doesn't know the perp.

109
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:26,466
- If he's hiding something,
we'll find it.

110

[suspenseful chime]

111
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,539
- Looks like the paramedic
missed a sliver of glass.

112
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,207
- Could that have
caused the memory loss?

113
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,776
- No, not deep enough.

114
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:37,310
And your head ct looks fine.

115
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,413
- And you still
don't remember anything?

116
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,848
- No.
No, and I feel like crap.

117
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,016
- Well, you're dehydrated.

118
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,519
I'll start an iv.

119
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:46,653
- Did you party last night?

120
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,654
- Uh, no.

121
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,922
Not at all, I was working.

122
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,891
- Dalton, I can't
tell you how many victims

123
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,926
Withhold information
about illegal drug use

124
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,861
Because they're scared
they're gonna get into trouble.

125
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,564
- We're not looking to jam
you up on a possession charge.

126
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,999
- If you had a dealer
in your apartment,

127
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,467
Or you were
partying with friends--

128
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:01,802
You just have to tell us.

129
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:02,903
- I don't do drugs.

130
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,806
I don't even drink.

131
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,507
What if someone drugged me?

132
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,910
- Okay. Like who?

133
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:13,246
- Eh...I don't know.

134
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,614
- Nadia,
how much longer you gonna

135
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:15,849
Keep this bathroom tied up?

136
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,084
You're worse than my ex-wife.

137
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,752
- Someone let
a sweet talker like you go?

138
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,787
I'm done scanning,
it's all yours.

139
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,758
- Does csu know there's
bloody handprints in here?

140
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:26,560
- They're right behind you
in the lunch line.

141
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,228
You know, those prints
look smeared to me.

142
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,563
But they'll lift them all.

143
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,630
- And bloody towels as well.

144
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:31,965
They're still damp.

145
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,267
- Well no one from the canvas
saw a bloody maniac.

146
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,236
So you gotta figure
he cleaned up before he left.

147
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,075
You didn't look in the shower?

148
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:44,611
- [sighs]

149
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,413
Washed clean.

150
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:48,715
- He took a shower while
I was passed out on the floor.

151
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,650
- Or maybe you came home
and surprised him

152
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:51,952
While he was in there.

153
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,086
- But why was I naked?

154
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:54,621
- That's
the million-dollar question.

155
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,323
- You think I raped her?
You think I did this?

156
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,457
- We're looking for answers.

157
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:58,625
And you're not providing any.

158
00:06:58,693 --> 00:06:59,760
- Well, I don't have any.

159
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,428
- Dalton, calm down
and work with us.

160
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:03,730
We're trying to figure out
how a dead naked woman

161
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,232
Ended up in your apartment.

162
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,833
- What time did
you come home last night?

163
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,068
- [sighs]

164
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,703
I don't remember coming home.

165
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,837
- You say you were working.

166
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,272
Where's that?
Did anybody see you?

167
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,840
- I'm a developer.

168
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:15,308
My partner bill and I...

169
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:19,279
Met with the buyers of
these co-op units we pre-sold.

170
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,648
About 75 people showed
up to our headquarters.

171
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:23,450
- Any one of them
unhappy with their purchase?

172
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,751
- All of them.

173
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,319
Construction
hit a little speed bump,

174
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:29,756
So we threw this cocktail mixer
to put their minds at ease.

175
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,992
- Dalton, you said
you weren't partying last night.

176
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:35,028
- Trust me, it was no party.

177
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,400
- Dalton was
dripping flop sweat.

178
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,402
You have no idea
how crucial it was

179
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,538
To instill
the investors with confidence.

180
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,273
- Of course I do,
that's step number one

181
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,441
In the idiot's
guide to flim-flamming.

182
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,912
- Hey, we're not running
the nigerian prince scam here.

183
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,080
This is gonna
be a landmark building.

184
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:56,249
- When do you
plan on completing it?

185
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,151
- As soon as
we shore up new financing.

186
00:07:58,219 --> 00:07:59,619
That was
the point of last night.

187
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,322
- You were trying to suck even
more money out of these people?

188
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,891
- Otherwise,
we have to file bankruptcy

189
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,026
And they lose everything.

190
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:07,961
- Well, how much
are they already in for?

191
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,497
- 200,000
to 400,000 each.

192
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:13,066
- So they all had
motive to murder both of you--

193
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,501
Or set you up for one.

194
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:17,204
- We were hoping for a slightly
more enthusiastic response.

195
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:20,006
That coward dalton
left me to deal with 'em.

196
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:22,943
At the end of the cocktail hour,
I called the meeting to order,

197
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,144
And he was gone.

198
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,713
- Maybe he
didn't leave on his own.

199
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:29,015
I'll need
a list of your victims.

200
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,450
I mean buyers.

201
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,118
- Absolutely not.

202
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:34,254
You can't drag them all
into a murder investigation.

203
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:37,257
- Even if it
means clearing your partner?

204
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,060
- Detectives...

205
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,094
- What do we got?

206
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:42,562
- The buildings
are connected.

207
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,198
That's mr. Rindell's bedroom
window right up there,

208
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,867
And the perp must've
tossed this out of it.

209
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,668
- Ah, what have we here?

210
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:55,075
- We got ladies'
clothes, shoes, and a purse.

211
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,010
- Why toss it over here if he
didn't want it to be found?

212
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,144
He could've
thrown it in the river.

213
00:08:58,212 --> 00:08:59,813
- I don't know,

214
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,982
But I just might've
found a motive for our murder.

215
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,817
Our victim's a doctor.

216
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:06,253
- Audrey hale, m.D.
Westside women's clinic.

217
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,090
- They do abortions.

218
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,132
- We're so
sorry for your loss.

219
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,201
- Our divorce was
finalized a few months ago.

220
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:16,637
But...I never
stopped loving audrey.

221
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:19,006
- A friendly divorce?

222
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,641
- Is there such a thing?

223
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,476
You can't imagine
the screaming matches--

224
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:24,445
Me begging her to leave
her job at the clinic,

225
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,847
And her saying she had a
commitment to uphold a...

226
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:29,817
Constitutionally
protected service.

227
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:31,685
- You didn't approve
of your wife's work.

228
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:33,454
- I was afraid for
our daughter clarissa.

229
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:34,621
- Your family get threats?

230
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:37,925
- A few years ago,
an anti-abortion group

231
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:41,695
Posted hundreds of doctors'
names, their home addresses,

232
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,764
And telephone numbers
on the internet.

233
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,232
Then we started getting
hang-up calls

234
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,034
In the middle of the night,
and nasty letters.

235
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:48,402
- Did you keep any of them?

236
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,905
- No, I--I didn't want
our daughter finding them.

237
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:55,409
And once that doctor
was shot in his own church

238
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:56,910
In kansas this summer,

239
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:59,646
I petitioned the court
for sole custody

240
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:04,151
But...Lost.

241
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:08,589
And audrey was supposed
to pick her up tomorrow.

242
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:11,458
I told her
this was gonna happen.

243
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:19,633
- Mr. Hale, did you or audrey
have any connection

244
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:23,704
With an r.T. Developers?

245
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:24,805
- No.

246
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,907
- How about a dalton rindell?

247
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:29,576
- Who's that?
One of those fanatical nuts?

248
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,412
- No, I am definitely
not one of them.

249
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,013
- Let's play a little
free association.

250
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,282
You say the first thing
that pops into your head.

251
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,984
Roe v. Wade.

252
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:38,652
- Ugh, two ways
to get across a creek.

253
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,687
- Do you consider
dr. Hale's murder a joke?

254
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,122
- No.

255
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,024
No, it was the most
horrific thing I've ever seen.

256
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,292
But I didn't do it.

257
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,227
I don't know her,
or anything about her.

258
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:48,595
- Then how'd
she get in your apartment?

259
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,764
- Forget that,
how'd she get in your bed?

260
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:52,065
- [sighs]

261
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,667
Look,
I know it sounds crazy,

262
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,235
But it had to be
one of the co-op owners.

263
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:56,403
I think
I'm being set up.

264
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:58,639
- Okay, here comes
the conspiracy theory.

265
00:10:58,706 --> 00:10:59,973
You go.

266
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,210
- A guy puts a chunk down
on a $3 million condo

267
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,578
That's never
gonna be built,

268
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:06,380
And he's not gonna
get any of his money back.

269
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,048
- I can see that
making a guy a little nutty.

270
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:10,717
- Right, so he starts obsessing
about the ills of the world

271
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:13,187
And kills two birds
with one hammer.

272
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:15,422
- We're gonna need the
investors' list to prove that.

273
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,623
- We're hanging on
by a thread.

274
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:18,158
Could you at least
be discreet?

275
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,526
- No problem.

276
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,128
Just answer
my partner's question.

277
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:24,932
Which are you?
Pro-choice, or no choice?

278
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:26,500
- I know it's
everybody's litmus test

279
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:29,036
For picking a president
or a supreme court justice.

280
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:31,905
It's not even
on my priority list.

281
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,474
- And I was just
starting to believe you.

282
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,243
Mr. Rindell,
abortion is the one subject

283
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,078
Everyone has
a strong opinion about.

284
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:39,513
- Abortion is murder.

285
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,648
- I know, that's what
I keep trying to tell her.

286
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,884
What group are you with?
- Operation save and deliver.

287
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,552
Life begins at conception.

288
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,221
- What if
my life is at risk?

289
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:48,755
- It's in
god's hands, not yours.

290
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,290
- What if I told you
I was raped?

291
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,559
- Well, the lord wouldn't have
brought a child into this world

292
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:54,127
If he didn't
have great plans for it.

293
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:57,364
- Even though she'll
be a constant reminder?

294
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,833
You have no idea
the toll that takes on a woman.

295
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,869
- You must've been happy
when dr. Hale was murdered.

296
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,270
- [scoffs]
no, no, no.

297
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:05,339
That was awful.
We don't condone any killing.

298
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:07,574
Hey--

299
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,810
But it is a blessing

300
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:13,747
There's one less
mass murderer out there.

301
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:16,049
- Ironically,
the young women she scares away

302
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:17,751
Are the ones
coming for birth control.

303
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,987
So yes, she's a danger,
but not a violent one.

304
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:22,256
- So what's with
the bulletproof glass here?

305
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,858
- We had that put in in '93,
after our sniper attack.

306
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,593
Our receptionist
was shot in the arm.

307
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:27,961
- Any more recent attacks?

308
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:29,296
- Well, not here.

309
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,898
But I monitor
the national stats.

310
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:35,202
Since the '70s, there have
been 175 arsons, 41 bombings.

311
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,970
- Dr. Hale's ex-husband
was telling us

312
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:38,438
About the hate mail
he received at home.

313
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:39,740
- Yeah, we'll we get
plenty of that here.

314
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,074
I have beth
pulling it out for you.

315
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:44,244
This is the first box.

316
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:45,546
- How many more like this?

317
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:47,748
- There are five or six.

318
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:49,049
[thuds]

319
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:50,918
- Oh, get down.
- Down.

320
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,021
- It's just
a harmless egging.

321
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,423
We get that
from time to time.

322
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:58,325
- Did you do this?

323
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,260
- It was a couple of kids.

324
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:01,428
- Which way did they go?

325
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,664
- I don't know,
I had my eyes closed.

326
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:06,633
But I'm touched for your
concern for the chicken fetuses.

327
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:07,834
- El, pop the trunk.

328
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:09,870
Dr. Kittle said audrey
was meeting a friend

329
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:10,871
For dinner last night.

330
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:12,606
- Male?
- Female.

331
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,141
Let's go
see if she made it.

332
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,315
- We had dinner at picholine.

333
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:23,817
We left there around 9:30.

334
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:24,918
Shared a taxi.

335
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:26,253
- So audrey went home?

336
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:30,324
- No, there was
night construction on fifth.

337
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,326
And we were
in stand-still traffic.

338
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:36,196
I saw this bar, said we should
get out and have a nightcap.

339
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:38,832
Audrey didn't want to,
but I dragged her.

340
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,367
- Do you remember
the name of the bar?

341
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,235
- That's
what I'm looking for.

342
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:44,104
- Anyone there
hassling her?

343
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:47,174
- No,
but there was this guy.

344
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,142
- Okay, linda.
Linda...

345
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,911
It's okay, calm down.

346
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,449
Just tell us about him.

347
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:57,217
- [exhales]

348
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,119
White, 30s,
really good-looking.

349
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:02,990
Audrey hadn't even looked at
another man since her divorce.

350
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:04,725
I'm the one
that got them talking.

351
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,560
- Well, could
he have instigated it?

352
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,929
Maybe followed you
into the place?

353
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,331
- No, it looked like
he'd been there for a while.

354
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,033
Oh!

355
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,368
Here it is.

356
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:16,269
West falls lounge.

357
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:18,138
- Okay, that's good.
But back to the guy?

358
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,207
- They really hit it off.

359
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:22,376
- How did it end with them?

360
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:26,713
- I don't know, I--

361
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:28,048
I just left her there.

362
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,217
I thought
I was doing her a favor.

363
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:32,285
- Did you
get the guy's name?

364
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:35,589
- [inhales sharply]
something like...Barnes.

365
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:40,694
Um...I just remember
it was a name of a bookstore.

366
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:42,929
Dalton?

367
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,432
- Yes.

368
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,000
- I appreciate
the lift home, I'm exhausted.

369
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:48,735
- Just got
to do a quick stop here.

370
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,237
Ah, here it is.

371
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,638
West falls lounge.

372
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:52,973
- You know this place?

373
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,008
- No.

374
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:57,611
- It's walking distance
from your office.

375
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,346
- I haven't been
to a bar in over a year.

376
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,484
- Back in a second.

377
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,453
[car door shuts]

378
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,591
- You sure
you weren't here last night?

379
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,427
- I'm positive.
Why do you keep asking me?

380
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:16,930
Look, I'm in the program.

381
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:19,399
One year, three months,
eight days sober.

382
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,734
- What do you know?

383
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:23,203
A one-year chip.

384
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,805
[exhales]

385
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,441
So, dalton...

386
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:30,110
You get a headache?

387
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,845
You were throwing up,
you were dehydrated.

388
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:35,315
- I was hit in the head.
- Or you had a hangover.

389
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:38,351
- I don't drink.
I need to use the restroom.

390
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,520
- Uh, wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.

391
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:42,923
Dalton.

392
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,026
Yo!
Get back here.

393
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:47,360
Dalton.

394
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,963
- That's the guy.
Right there.

395
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:51,298
- Dalton,
what are you doing here?

396
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:52,632
- Where's the men's room?

397
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,334
- What, you don't
remember from last night?

398
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:55,902
- What are you talking about?

399
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,771
- [scoffs] well,
you were knocking them back.

400
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,806
- What's going on here?

401
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:01,541
- Well, the bartender
says that you were

402
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,577
Buying audrey rounds
after her friend left.

403
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:04,978
- Why would you say that?

404
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,680
- Buddy,
you two left together.

405
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,548
I know
a hookup when I see one.

406
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:09,716
- You're lying!
- Hey!

407
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:11,318
- Who put you up to this?
- Back! Let go!

408
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:13,186
- Take it easy.
- I'm gonna--

409
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:14,621
I'm gonna be sick again.

410
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,089
- All the way back.
On the right.

411
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:19,126
- [coughs softly]

412
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:26,399
- Wait a minute.
- I can't, I can't.

413
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:29,503
[cell phone rings]

414
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,038
- Stabler.

415
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:34,007
Hello?

416
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,376
Hello?

417
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,078
Who is this?

418
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:39,613
Yeah, go ahead.

419
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,747
[quiet aside]
the lab results.

420
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,816
The bloody print
in the bathroom?

421
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,284
- Dalton's.

422
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:45,752
- And the dna
from the rape kit.

423
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,320
Great. Thanks.

424
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:49,089
Hey, dalton.

425
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:52,292
Let's go. Suck it up.
Get out here.

426
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,694
[knocking]
hey, let's go.

427
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:55,695
- Where'd he go?

428
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:57,531
Where is he?

429
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,533
- Dalton!

430
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,667
He's running.

431
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,002
- I'll take the front!

432
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:09,075
[breathless]
I don't see him.

433
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,481
- Son of a bitch.
We lost him.

434
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,388
- Now what part
of taking a killer rapist

435
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,523
On a field trip
sounded like a bright idea?

436
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:23,559
- Dalton wasn't technically on--
- zip it, john.

437
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,427
They are perfectly capable

438
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,363
Of making their
own half-assed excuses.

439
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,397
- No excuse.

440
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,732
Liv was
interviewing the bartender,

441
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,100
I was supposed
to have eyes on dalton.

442
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,835
- It was equally
my responsibility.

443
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,037
- Spare me
the mutual stroke-fest.

444
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:36,472
What are
we doing to fix this?

445
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,374
- We sat on his apartment
all last night,

446
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:39,842
He was smart enough
not to come home.

447
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,211
- Got a subpoena
for his cell phone records,

448
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,146
And somebody's watching the
garage where he keeps his car.

449
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:45,280
- I put the word out

450
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,049
To the airport, train,
and bus terminals.

451
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:49,184
- His bank has an alert on
his credit and debit cards.

452
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:50,419
He hasn't used them yet.

453
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,321
- Well, then somebody
is harboring him.

454
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:53,722
Girlfriend, parents...

455
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,091
- Dalton told us he
wasn't dating anybody seriously,

456
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,459
But we did a little digging.

457
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:59,395
His parents
divorced when he was a kid.

458
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:01,063
His father's in california,

459
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,532
And his mother died
from cirrhosis of the liver.

460
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,868
- There's no one in the rindell
clan can handle their liquor.

461
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,936
There were
multiple domestic abuse calls

462
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,506
Against a drunken dalton senior
whaling on the wife and kid

463
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:11,607
Until he skipped out on them.

464
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,008
- Morning, detectives.

465
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,077
- Just when I thought
my day couldn't get any worse.

466
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:17,946
- Has anyone seen
my missing defendant?

467
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,915
- We could try and find him,

468
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:21,950
Unless you wanna just waste
our time busting my balls.

469
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,553
- Oh, I'd never kick
a fellow when he's down.

470
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:27,623
I'm sure you feel
like a grade-a moron as it is.

471
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,458
Of course, I'm the one
who has to slog through

472
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,361
A wade hearing because you
tainted the bartender's I.D.

473
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:33,796
- What do you need, sonya?

474
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,799
- On the assumption you'll
retrieve dalton rindell for me,

475
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,501
I'm proceeding
with my trial prep.

476
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:41,670
I actually just
stopped by to catch a movie.

477
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,038
Want to join me?

478
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:49,812
- Here's your recreation
of the crime scene

479
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,380
Based on
the leica scanstation,

480
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:53,315
Which you can show
to the jury from any angle.

481
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,484
Dalton approached from
the left, wielding the hammer.

482
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,786
Audrey must've
seen the first swing coming,

483
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,922
Scrambles out of the bed,
still tangled in the sheets.

484
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:03,325
Dalton comes around--
- he's got her trapped.

485
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,927
- She's facing him.

486
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:07,129
Tries to ward off the first
blow, which breaks her wrist.

487
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:08,664
As he hauls back for
the second strike here, he--

488
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,098
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

489
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,134
She was raped first,
right?

490
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,670
- You want me
to simulate that?

491
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,240
- Actually, it's looking
like the sex was consensual.

492
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:20,742
I mean, they hooked up in a bar,
they botwere drinking heavily.

493
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,110
- Oh, please.

494
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,413
Half the rapists I've
put away were drunk or high.

495
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:26,148
It's called dutch courage.

496
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,649
It doesn't excuse jack.

497
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:29,251
And stopping her
from crying rape

498
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,853
Is a motive
to kill her, right?

499
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,355
Keep going.

500
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,556
- Audrey's on her side.

501
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:36,091
He strikes h temple,

502
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,927
'causing this arterial
spurting pattern on the carpet.

503
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:41,597
Now she's face down, covering
her head with her hands.

504
00:19:41,664 --> 00:19:43,966
One of the strikes
breaks her watch.

505
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,001
- It's gonna be hard
for a jury to watch.

506
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,637
- But easy for them
to convict.

507
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,105
- Castoff extends
onto the ceiling,

508
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:51,340
Means he was bringing
the hammer

509
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:52,975
Back all the way
over his head for each blow.

510
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,743
- Wait, this shows him
covered in blood.

511
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:56,912
- There would've
been tons of back spatter.

512
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,680
- Well, do we
have his bloody clothes?

513
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:00,949
- No, he must have
been naked too.

514
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:04,253
- So after he cleaned up,
he realized what he'd done,

515
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,521
And he
started banging his head

516
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:07,055
Against the
medicine cabinet mirror.

517
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,524
- Bull.
He was staging the scene

518
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:10,726
To make it look like
he had been attacked as well.

519
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,628
- Captain,
this just came in.

520
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:15,330
- Well, if juries want
a video of the crime,

521
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:16,798
You're practically
giving them one.

522
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:20,102
- Yeah,
this is really good.

523
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:22,871
Listen, raise
the production values for me.

524
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:25,440
Spare no expense.

525
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:28,744
- We just got
dalton's cell phone records.

526
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,879
Dozens of calls
to the partner.

527
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:34,650
All unanswered, but he had
a nice long chat with his ex.

528
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,788
- I have
no idea where dalton is.

529
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,356
- Really?
You mean he didn't mention it

530
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:43,759
During your 17-minute
conversation last night?

531
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,095
- No, he just
told me his insane story.

532
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,630
- It end with a confession?

533
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,265
- He swears
he's being set up.

534
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,134
- Well, he asked you for
a place to hole up, didn't he?

535
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,602
- He asked.
I said no.

536
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,939
- Will you mind taking us
to your place to verify that?

537
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,207
- Not at all. As soon
as my open house is over.

538
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,809
- Well, of course
you being a rental agent,

539
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:03,679
You have access to plenty of
apartments you can stash him in.

540
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,213
- You're not gonna make us
get a search warrant

541
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:07,749
For every one of them,
are you?

542
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:09,484
- After what dalton
put me through,

543
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:10,919
I'd never help
that son of a bitch.

544
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:12,054
- Bad marriage?

545
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:15,123
- Varied days
of wine and roses.

546
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,926
I quit drinking,
dalton couldn't.

547
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:19,394
- Was he abusive?

548
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:21,997
- The real dalton is the
greatest guy you'll ever meet.

549
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,333
When he drinks,
he turns into a monster.

550
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,101
He kicked a lot
of holes in our walls,

551
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:27,402
But he only hurt me once.

552
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,637
That's when I walked.

553
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,806
- Well, be grateful
you're still alive.

554
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,541
- Sober,
he wouldn't hurt a fly.

555
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:35,477
I heard he went on the wagon
after our divorce was final.

556
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,980
- Yeah, well he fell off
with a big splash.

557
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,415
- If you wouldn't
help him, who would?

558
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,684
- [scoff]
his old drinking buddy.

559
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:46,955
His business partner.
Bill tattinger.

560
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,690
- [grunting]
you son of a bitch!

561
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:49,825
- Hey!
Police, break it up.

562
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:50,959
[grunting, growling]

563
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:53,762
Hey, hey.
Police, break it up.

564
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,764
Break it up, break it up.
What are you doing?

565
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:56,965
You're
only making things worse.

566
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:59,167
First evading arrest,
and now assault?

567
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,503
- I didn't--I didn't run
because I was guilty.

568
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,739
I ran because I needed
to prove my innocence.

569
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:06,041
Admit what you did!
- He's out of his freakin' mind.

570
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:08,110
- Now he's under arrest.
- It doesn't matter.

571
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:10,545
I finally figured out
who's responsible for this.

572
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:12,714
Tell him.
Tell him!

573
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:14,950
[panting]

574
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:18,720
- What?
Tell us what?

575
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:20,689
- We were dying there.

576
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,890
Back in the day,

577
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,992
You closed million-dollar deals
over drinks.

578
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,595
I convinced him a little liquid
courage could steady his nerves.

579
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:28,063
- You ruined my life!

580
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:29,698
- No, that's over.
Let's go.

581
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,566
- There's no way
one drink put me on my ass.

582
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:32,768
What'd you put in it?

583
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:35,404
- Nothing!
I didn't do anything illegal!

584
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,239
- No, not
by frat boy standards.

585
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:38,807
You wanna
have your way with them?

586
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:39,975
Get them nice and drunk.

587
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:42,044
- I swear to god,
I only gave him one.

588
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,712
What harm could that do?

589
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,913
[door opens]

590
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:47,649
- Look, I'm on a
prescription benzo for anxiety.

591
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,751
- You're not supposed
to mix that with alcohol.

592
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,186
- Bill kept telling me
one wouldn't hurt.

593
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:53,121
He must've made the drink
a lot stronger than he told me.

594
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:54,489
- Well, the thing is,
after you left bill,

595
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:55,590
You drank seven or eight
on your own.

596
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:56,858
- That we know of.

597
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,193
- Yeah, but I didn't even know
I was doing it.

598
00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:00,162
I don't even
remember leaving the office.

599
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,830
All right, the combination
of meds and alcohol

600
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:03,598
Must've completely
disoriented me.

601
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,300
- You had no problem
finding the nearest bar.

602
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:06,568
- And you're the
one who did the ordering.

603
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,303
Not bill, not audrey--you.

604
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:11,206
- It's only
because bill pressured me

605
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,674
Into that first drink.

606
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:15,043
That's the reason
I quit in the first place.

607
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:18,580
Look, once I have one
in me, I can't stop.

608
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,948
[sighs]

609
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:23,318
- [sighs]
what a load of crap.

610
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:25,821
It's not that he couldn't stop,
he just didn't want to.

611
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:27,856
- It's not
that cut and dry, sonya.

612
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:30,459
Alcoholism is
a recognized addiction.

613
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:34,262
- That millions of people
have successfully overcome.

614
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,131
- I've been
sober over 20 years.

615
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:39,601
But I struggle
with it every day.

616
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,636
It's not something
you ever overcome.

617
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:43,371
- But you're
not drinking, are you?

618
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,006
Proving my point.

619
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:50,345
Alcohol is just a crutch for
weak-willed pathetic losers.

620
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,781
- How many coffees and
cigarettes you had today, sonya?

621
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,150
- [laughing]
oh, please.

622
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:56,985
I can
quit anytime I want.

623
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:58,386
And if
I committed a felony,

624
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:01,123
I wouldn't trot them out
like the old twinkie defense.

625
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,091
Intoxication has never been

626
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,260
And never will be
a defense to rape and murder.

627
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,728
- Well, you have
at it on the murder,

628
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:08,530
But I don't think
you're getting him on the rape.

629
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:09,765
- Actually, captain,

630
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:11,666
There's someone here
you need to talk to.

631
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:15,170
- I used to be
an assistant at r.T. Developers.

632
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:17,239
My friend
who still works there called

633
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:20,909
And told me what
dalton was arrested for.

634
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:23,445
- You don't seem
too surprised.

635
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,615
- A little over a year ago,

636
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:29,151
Just after
dalton and selena separated,

637
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,788
I was working late and wanted
to let him know I was leaving.

638
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:34,556
- And what happened?

639
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:36,291
- He'd been
drinking in there all day.

640
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,295
He exposed himself.

641
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:43,431
I tried to leave, but...

642
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,468
He cornered me.

643
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:54,643
He grabbed my breast and...

644
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:04,786
Forced his hand
down my pants.

645
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,761
- I told you
he was a rapist.

646
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,373
- So let me guess,
you have no memory of

647
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:18,741
Sexually assaulting
your old assistant?

648
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,443
- Oh, I took
responsibility for that.

649
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:23,579
- Paying a girl off to keep her
from filing criminal charges

650
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,181
Is not
taking responsibility.

651
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:27,417
- Ask glenna
when that happened.

652
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,786
It was the day I finally
admitted I had a problem.

653
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:31,054
I quit cold turkey.

654
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:32,455
I thought the dt's
were gonna kill me,

655
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:34,157
But I never
touched another drop.

656
00:25:34,224 --> 00:25:36,993
Not until bill practically
poured it dowv my throat.

657
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:40,029
- Ugh, cut the crap.
Jeez!

658
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:41,698
- You need something,
sonya?

659
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:42,899
- Yeah.

660
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:45,568
For him to admit
he killed and raped audrey hale.

661
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:47,904
I got tired of watching
you two play pattycake, sorry.

662
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:49,706
- How can I admit
something I don't remember?

663
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,074
Look, I had
a history of blackouts

664
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:52,308
In my drinking days.

665
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,610
One time I woke up
in a hotel room in phoenix.

666
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,245
I had no clue
how I got there.

667
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,581
- The liquor made me do it.
My partner made me do it.

668
00:25:58,649 --> 00:25:59,916
- He did!
He admitted it.

669
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:01,117
- Please.

670
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,885
It's not like
he slipped you a mickey.

671
00:26:02,953 --> 00:26:05,288
And he's not the one
who killed audrey, you are.

672
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,223
You lured her to your place,

673
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,825
Found out what
she did for a living,

674
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:10,493
And then you killed her
in a drunken rage.

675
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:12,895
- I'm not even anti-abortion.
- Okay.

676
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:14,397
So her profession
was just a fluke.

677
00:26:14,465 --> 00:26:15,398
Then why did you kill her?

678
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:16,733
- I don't know!

679
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,135
I swear I have no memory
of what happened that night.

680
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,870
- Fine.

681
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:23,973
Maybe this
will jog your memory.

682
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:43,926
- That's me.
- Yeah.

683
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:45,528
- You can't show that
to a jury, can you?

684
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:47,797
- No, not
with your likeness, but...

685
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:48,798
Everything else.

686
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:51,601
I made
this one just for you.

687
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:57,106
- I want to talk
to a lawyer.

688
00:26:57,174 --> 00:26:58,908
- Thanks for your help.

689
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,312
[door slams closed]

690
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:08,985
- While the initial
decision to drink is a choice,

691
00:27:09,052 --> 00:27:11,254
There comes a time
when the addiction switch

692
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:13,022
Is turned on in the brain.

693
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,424
I believe this is
the case with mr. Rindell.

694
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:18,461
- Dr. Sopher,
you conducted a study

695
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,397
Involving the brain imaging
of alcoholics.

696
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:22,832
- Yes, and
the results indicate--

697
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,333
- The people renew
their objection

698
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:26,202
To this hearing
in its entirety.

699
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,703
- Counselor.
- It doesn't matter

700
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,773
What voodoo science
she trots out as an excuse.

701
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,909
Intoxication has
been banned as a defense

702
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:34,510
To rape and murder
dating back--

703
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:36,813
- The people didn't
meet their burden for rape.

704
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,281
That charge was dropped.

705
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:40,149
- Banned
as a defense to murder

706
00:27:40,217 --> 00:27:42,318
Dating back
to the 19th century.

707
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:44,987
- Would your honor
remind ms. Paxton

708
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:49,058
That the entire point
of a frye hearing is

709
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:53,563
To consider the admissibility
of new science at trial.

710
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,064
- I do have
other matters to consider.

711
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,400
Objection overruled.

712
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:01,771
Continue with your witness,
mr. Kressler.

713
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,372
- What was the outcome
of your study?

714
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,342
- Addiction is
a neurobiological disease.

715
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,810
A brain disease.

716
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:10,079
- You have evidence
to support this?

717
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,681
- Imaging
of addicted individuals

718
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:14,717
Shows physical changes
in areas of the brain

719
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:17,854
Critical to judgment, memory,
and behavioral control.

720
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:20,890
So while mr. Rindell took
a drink of his own volition,

721
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:24,227
Because of his disease,
he was physically incapable

722
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:25,962
Of controlling
the urge to keep drinking.

723
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:30,333
- Which led him to kill.

724
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,368
- Dr. Sopher...

725
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:35,238
Do all addicts commit murder?

726
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:37,039
- No, of course not.

727
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:38,441
- And your findings,

728
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:42,044
Are they generally accepted
within the scientific community?

729
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,280
- We do have our detractors.

730
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:48,751
- Huh.

731
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:52,054
Do you believe
if I had an inoperable tumor

732
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:54,090
That I could
just will it away?

733
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:55,358
- No.

734
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:57,393
- Because
a tumor is a disease,

735
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:00,196
Not a behavior, right?

736
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:08,137
Alcoholics stop drinking
all the time

737
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:14,243
By sheer willpower alone.

738
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:17,146
And you know
why they can do that?

739
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,716
Because alcoholism
is not a disease.

740
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:27,556
Good news, people!

741
00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:29,125
Judge moredock
isn't allowing

742
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:32,228
Dalton's cockamamie "alcoholism
is a disease" defense.

743
00:29:32,296 --> 00:29:34,664
- Well, I'm familiar
with dr. Sopher's work,

744
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,765
And the point
of her research

745
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:37,633
Isn't to excuse
criminal behavior.

746
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:39,502
It's to find a cure.
- Yeah, well...

747
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,636
Good luck with that.

748
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:42,672
- If they could,
crime would be down 50%.

749
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,173
- More than that
for sexual assaults,

750
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,775
Some of us
might be out of a job.

751
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:48,010
- Please, people do bad things
'cause they're bad people.

752
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,745
Getting drunk to do it
is just an excuse.

753
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:52,181
- Olivia, finally
we agree on something.

754
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,817
- Liv, if there
had been a cure a decade ago,

755
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:57,119
Your mom
might still be alive.

756
00:29:57,187 --> 00:30:00,423
- What...
Mommy liked her cocktail?

757
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:04,961
- My mother
was a falling-down drunk.

758
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:07,663
She died going
down a flight of stairs.

759
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:12,501
- She started drinking
after she was raped, to cope.

760
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:15,071
- Yeah, she never quite managed
to do that with me there.

761
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:18,307
- Well, no offense
to your mother, olivia,

762
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,309
But you can't
hide behind a bottle.

763
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:23,279
Now dalton is claiming
temporary insanity

764
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:25,281
Due to alcoholic psychosis.

765
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,351
- Well, take it
from somebody who's been there.

766
00:30:28,418 --> 00:30:32,021
Odds are, there will be a
sympathetic drinker on that jury

767
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:34,023
Who's had a blackout themselves.
- It won't matter.

768
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:36,325
Not after I show them
the 3-d recreation

769
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:39,829
Of dalton hammering the brains
out of audrey's skull.

770
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,769
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, I warn you.

771
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:49,538
What you are about
to see is graphically violent.

772
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:52,274
And forensic evidence proves
that these are

773
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:55,544
The indisputable
actions of the defendant.

774
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:00,916
- Objection!
- No!

775
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,551
She can't play that!
- Move for a mistrial!

776
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:03,919
- She told me the jury
couldn't see this one!

777
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,488
- Oh, my god!
- Bailiff!

778
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:07,023
Remove the jury.

779
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,391
- Wrong one!

780
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:12,061
Your honor, I-I have no idea
how this happened.

781
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:13,996
- Counselors,
my chambers!

782
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:17,066
- [panting]

783
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:20,336
- What happened?

784
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:22,705
- [sighs]

785
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,040
The judge
sent the jury home

786
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:27,510
So we could have a hearing
on my royal screw-up.

787
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:29,445
[chuckles]
payback's a bitch.

788
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,946
Come on.
Come on, let me have it.

789
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,314
- Everyone makes mistakes.

790
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:34,617
- Not me.
I must be losing it.

791
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,520
- What happened
at the hearing?

792
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:41,991
- That weasel kressler
said he knew I was losing,

793
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,759
And purposefully
played the wrong disc

794
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,961
To force a mistrial.

795
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,631
- It was an accident,
wasn't it?

796
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,932
- Of course it was.

797
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,634
Sheesh.

798
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,569
But the judge
isn't convinced.

799
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,638
So he's polling
the jurors tomorrow

800
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,773
To see if they
can disregard the video.

801
00:31:57,841 --> 00:31:58,874
- What if
some of them can't?

802
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:00,209
- Then he'll
have to release them.

803
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:03,479
Even with the alternates,
if the pool dips below 12,

804
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,083
He'll have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

805
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,384
- So you get him on retrial.

806
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:09,485
- Not if the judge determines

807
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,354
There was
prosecutorial misconduct.

808
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:15,391
In that case,
double jeopardy attaches,

809
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:17,526
And there is no retrial.

810
00:32:17,594 --> 00:32:22,898
Party's over,
everybody just goes on home.

811
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:24,100
- So dalton gets a walk.

812
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:25,534
- You gotta be kidding me.

813
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,236
- Oh, that I were.

814
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:30,106
Hey, people...
Does anybody work here?

815
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:32,141
My friends need drinks.

816
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:35,077
[chuckles]
hello?

817
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:36,645
- I got to go home.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

818
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:39,181
Stabler, you need to go
over your testimony with me.

819
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,783
- I know exactly
what I'm going to say.

820
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:41,817
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Uh-uh-uh.

821
00:32:41,885 --> 00:32:42,985
Please, just come--
- actually...

822
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:44,353
Why don't you
cut yourself off?

823
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,322
What time do you have
to be at the hearing tomorrow?

824
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:47,523
- 9:00 a.M.

825
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,191
We have a lot of work
to do, olivia.

826
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,393
I'll probably be up
all night re-strategizing,

827
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:52,962
So can we get started?

828
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:54,396
- Good luck.

829
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:57,633
- Here.

830
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,246
I'm here!

831
00:33:10,313 --> 00:33:11,747
I'm here, your honor.

832
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,649
- You're 45 minutes late,
counselor.

833
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:15,351
- I deeply apologize,
your honor.

834
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:18,854
I was involved in a
fender bender on my way, and...

835
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:20,189
- Are you all right?

836
00:33:20,257 --> 00:33:21,257
- Oh, yeah.

837
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:23,659
Yeah, I'm fine, thank you.

838
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:25,694
I'm just...Whoo.

839
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:27,796
I made it.
Just--oh, sorry.

840
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:29,999
- You don't
look all right to me.

841
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:32,368
Do you need medical help?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

842
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:35,304
No, no. I might've, um,
I might have hit my head

843
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:38,774
In the fender bender,
but I can play hurt.

844
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:42,511
All right, I can...

845
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:44,446
I'm ready
to proceed, your honor.

846
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:45,781
- I think
you need to be looked at.

847
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,516
- She's drunk.

848
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:48,684
- Wha--excuse me?

849
00:33:48,752 --> 00:33:50,819
- She's drunk.
- Excuse me, dalton.

850
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:52,555
Are you--did you
say something to me?

851
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:53,689
- Trust me, I would know.

852
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:55,424
- Uh, your honor,
this is outrageous.

853
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,927
- Oh, what's your problem,
you tiny little man?

854
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,563
Hey, dalton--
- ms. Paxton.

855
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,398
Have you been drinking?

856
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:05,134
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

857
00:34:05,202 --> 00:34:06,468
Not at all.

858
00:34:06,536 --> 00:34:08,037
I'm just exhausted,
your honor.

859
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:10,272
I was up all night preparing--

860
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,807
- What? Drinks?

861
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:15,844
- No, I was going over detective
benson's testimony with her.

862
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:18,047
Ask her.
[scoffs]

863
00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:19,048
- Bailiff...

864
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:21,917
Get detective benson
over here.

865
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:24,420
And have her
bring a breathalyzer.

866
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,131
- Where would you like me to
administer the test, your honor?

867
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,667
!
Right at the defense table?
- Guess again.

868
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:44,173
- Unfortunately,
the prosecution.

869
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:46,041
- No.

870
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:48,310
You can't be serious.

871
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,246
- Could you please
clear this up, olivia?

872
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:52,548
They're trying
to ruin my reputation.

873
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:57,152
- I have no desire to ruin
your reputation, counselor.

874
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,489
Detective, were you drinking
with ms. Paxton last night?

875
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,523
- I wasn't drinking.

876
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:04,593
- Was she?

877
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,032
- I saw her
consume two drinks.

878
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,534
- So you did lie to me.

879
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:16,238
How many drinks did you have
after detective benson left?

880
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:18,274
- I object to this line
of questioning, your honor.

881
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:20,042
- Then blow.
- No.

882
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,978
I can attest as an officer
of this court

883
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,747
That I am not intoxicated.

884
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:27,650
- Sonya, your eyes
are bloodshot and watery.

885
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:31,320
Your speech is slurred,
and you stink of booze.

886
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:34,523
Now blow.

887
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,292
- I thought
you were my friend.

888
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:37,626
- Just do it.

889
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:40,229
- Don't do this to me.

890
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:41,897
Olivia, please
don't do this to me.

891
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:44,733
- You did this
to yourself, sonya.

892
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:48,404
Now blow.

893
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:51,473
- [sighs]

894
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,942
[blows breath steadily]

895
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,011
[clicks]
- I got it.

896
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,081
- Bring it up here,
let me see.

897
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:00,716
- I saw it, your honor.

898
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,052
It's 0.7.
It's legally sober.

899
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,187
- I was hoping for a zero.

900
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:06,622
- It's still climbing.

901
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,225
- For the record,
your blood level count is...

902
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,027
0.082.

903
00:36:12,095 --> 00:36:14,196
- That's residual
from last night.

904
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:15,464
I'm fine, your honor.

905
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:16,699
I am ready to proceed.

906
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:19,768
- Counselor...
You have a problem.

907
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:23,238
I'm ordering you
removed from this courtroom.

908
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,209
Detective.

909
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:30,279
- Let's go.

910
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:34,283
Let's go.
- I got it.

911
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:35,884
I got it.
- Go.

912
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:38,220
- I got it.

913
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,399
- A shocking development
in the trial of dalton rindell

914
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:53,102
For the murder of
abortion doctor audrey hale.

915
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,771
- A mistrial was declared
after a crime scene recreation

916
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,040
Concocted by the prosecution
was shown to the jury

917
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,509
With the defendant's
image photoshopped onto it.

918
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:03,612
- I hope you know that
you're the luckiest man alive.

919
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,681
- You think?

920
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:07,116
No matter how long I live,

921
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,351
No matter what I do
with the rest of my life,

922
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:11,453
My obituary
is already written.

923
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,923
Dalton rindell,
the man who killed audrey hale.

924
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:17,226
- It's still all about you.

925
00:37:19,562 --> 00:37:24,066
- I've destroyed
so many lives.

926
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:27,302
- You finally
owning up to it?

927
00:37:30,306 --> 00:37:32,007
You know you can
never serve time for this,

928
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,842
No matter what you tell me.

929
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,547
So why don't you
get it off your chest?

930
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:41,016
Tell me.

931
00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:46,555
- After
seeing all the evidence,

932
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:50,292
After watching that
prosecutor falling down drunk,

933
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,129
Ruining her own career...

934
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:57,733
It was like
looking in the mirror.

935
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:05,574
I finally realized
I'd done it, I killed her.

936
00:38:05,642 --> 00:38:08,444
- Why?

937
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:13,849
- I swear I don't know.
I swear to god.

938
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,786
Uh, I had
no reason to hurt her.

939
00:38:17,854 --> 00:38:20,656
My doctor told me
that in an alcoholic blackout,

940
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:24,893
Maybe I might have known
exactly what I was doing,

941
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:28,564
But the memory never formed,

942
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:31,733
And it never will.

943
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:33,602
Maybe the stress from
my business going under

944
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,404
Made me snap, and I--

945
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:40,275
And I took it out on her,
I don't know.

946
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:43,278
How am I supposed
to live with that?

947
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:46,348
- I don't know.

948
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:48,083
- Oh.

949
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:49,485
- Dalton. Dalton.

950
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:51,920
<i>Can you give me a statement
for the ledger, please?</i>

951
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:53,689
- Do you have anything
to say to the victim's family?

952
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:55,624
- Dalton, how does it feel
to get away with murder?

953
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:57,159
- Move. Move.

954
00:38:57,227 --> 00:38:59,261
- Dalton,
you can't walk away.

955
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:01,630
- At least he walked
because of the video mix-up,

956
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:03,398
And not paxton's...

957
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,167
Don't have to mention
the irony of that.

958
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:06,635
- Svu was too much for her.

959
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:08,470
The pressure must have
triggered her drinking.

960
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,439
- Explains why she was
such a control freak.

961
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:12,441
White-knuckled drunk
just hanging on by a thread.

962
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:13,842
- What a hypocrite.

963
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,878
- She was a good lawyer
with a bad problem.

964
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:17,546
- I definitely saw
a lot of my mother in her.

965
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:20,349
- Career's over, there's no way
she's coming back from this.

966
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:22,684
She's a walking clusterf--

967
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,259
- I couldn't
have said it better.

968
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:35,797
Though, I wouldn't have--
I wouldn't have censored myself.

969
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:44,406
I just wanted to say
that, um,

970
00:39:44,474 --> 00:39:47,342
It's been
an honor working with you.

971
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,378
- You taking
some personal time?

972
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:50,913
- No.
No, no, no.

973
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,616
I'm [sniffles] actually on
my way to court-ordered rehab.

974
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,625
[sighs]

975
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,528
I know that there
is no way

976
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:12,234
That you will ever be able
to forgive me.

977
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:16,338
But I intend to make amends

978
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:22,010
To each
and every one of you.

979
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,251
I'm sorry.
